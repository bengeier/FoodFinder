{"text":"Had 3bs. of the Trifecta 2 Crawfish. Hot! Make sure you get two empty buckets, and dump the bag into one of them, so the sauce mixes into the bugs. Won't do medium again. Too hot for me, and I lived and ate in New Orleans. Also, way busy on Fridays; hour wait for a two top."}
{"text":"We ate there with a friend and had a good time. The food is yummy, and the staff are friendly and fast. The only drawback for us on first visit was the noise level. It's loud and would be a fun place with family or other large groups. We'll go back soon."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's that simple. Great food, great staff. I always make certain to bring my out of town guests to eat here. It's a must try."}
{"text":"Our service was great but the food was not that great. Sweet potato fry's were a little too greasy and fish was served on top of it.  The atmosphere was too casual for us."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent staff. The manager came around and said hello. I had been before with my wife and he was very friendly then too. Will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Nice kitchy atmosphere.  Good beer selection... but the food is just very, very average.  Had the shrimp p'boy, hush puppies, gumbo, and the snow crab boil.  All very average.  The p'boy has way too much bread and the coleslaw and shrimps had zero flavor.  ZERO.   

Had fresh oysters...and they had a very average flavor.  They were also was too big.  Tell tale sign that they were super farmed... (i.e. hormones and stimulants to make them big)

The snow crab boil was just ok... nothing special, but nothing bad.  The pacific rim sauce is very good and saved the dish, but overall, this is a place that rides more on the \"dining experience\" than the quality of the food.  

Nice if you want to go somewhere and drink beers and have a nice time.  If you are looking for quality seafood, you will be very disappointed."}
{"text":"Alot of people have bias opinions of this restaurant, comparing it to boiling crab,kickin crab and hot n juicy... But as I must say first is that dont have high expectations and think it will be on point with what's in cali or Vegas... They've only been open for almost a month and they're still getting used to how things roll... It was my second time coming here and I must say the first time coming I think was a better experience than the second... I had the shrimp trifecta (dupe for whole shabang) with mild heat... It didn't taste like anything really just a lot of butter and no garlic at all.. the shrimp is cooked perfectly and isn't small. I think they should just keep up with the tastes and flavoring then maybe it'll taste a lot better..

The customer service was okay. Our waiter was nowhere to be found so we asked another if we could get some extra condiments and he replys \"oh I can't do that for you I'd have to tell your waiter\"... Ummm seriously it's not hard to get extra sauce lol geeze. Put a bit of effort in serving even if youre not serving us. You're a server to begin with anyways! There's only one server that had a good/welcoming attitude, our waiter seemed bored and zombiesh he was very quiet... Overall I don't think the atmosphere and overall food is horrible, they just need a bit of time to perfect things as they are the only place to get a dupe of what you can get in cali.  

I'll still be coming to this place and I'll be expecting better service and better food... So on and so forth."}
{"text":"The owner is a very understanding and nice man.
I think I was having a very odd and weird day. It was my first time at the restaurant. My stomach was feeling well; my food didn't seem to sit well in my stomach. 
I told the owner and he gave me a gift card to come back. I gave it to my sister because we went there for her birthday. 
I ended up taking the left over homes and let my friend eat them and I had a few bites. I will be returning to try their food again. I will load up on corn bread because that stuff is amazing! Thank you staff and ownership for being completely understanding. I was having a rough day."}
{"text":"Beats Joe's Crab Shack by a long shot! If I could give them 10 stars, I would. The 1lb of shrimp with trifecta seasoning and #4 for the heat washes down great with a Stella or Purple Haze ( I do wish the beer could be a little colder when served ). The atmosphere, food, and every server I've had have been amazing. Will continue to return for some hot ass shrimp!"}
{"text":"The best seafood in town! Everyone loves it. Good service.  Delicious food. Great they have rice too! VERY VERY reasonable price."}
{"text":"Top notch food! Great service! I will be coming back on a regular basis! So glad these guys opened up in the west valley!"}
{"text":"They have amazing crab legs that are large in size. They serve everything in plastic bags and you get to pick your seasoning. The seasoning is awesome there, but you are using your hands to eat and then they bring sealed bags that are almost impossible to open when your hands are wet and slippery. I gave them 1 star because I had  a very rude waiter named Larry who had no issue with causing my child to cry. Here is the story, I have a 5 month old baby that we have taken every where some she was 10 days old. She sleeps in her car seat almost every time we go to dinner. Even when we go to loud places, such as Lo Lo's chicken and waffles, Texas road house, Buffalo Wild Wings, Chili's, and many more. The loud noise helps her sleep even more. 
Well they were screaming out a birthday announcement at the top of their lungs and they woke up the baby of course. Way louder than needed. But I have no issue, that happens. So I told my waiter Larry, \"They just scared the Hell out of my kid screaming Happy Birthday do you know if they are going to do that again?\" His response was, \"Yeah this is a loud place, and if we didn't scream that loud every time for everyone than someone would get mad at us\"
That is my issue, I'm paying this waiters tip and he can't say you know I will check on that for you? Instead he just says yeah it's a loud place. Are you kidding me? Horrible response and a lost customer."}
{"text":"Best crab EVER!!! My husband when arriving thought we were at just another \"trough town\" type of place...\"dinner in a bag?\" he says...it was so much fun to watch him \"amaze\" over his crab...full sauce everywhere and bib in place...it was like the way the rat in Ratatouille describes flavor combinations....sooo amazing...we will have a regular Angry Crab night from here on out!!"}
{"text":"This was absolutely amazing. Took my mom and grandma here for Mother's Day and our server was Val. She was fantastic, the food was fresh and delicious. I would recommend the trifecta spice and medium heat for people who like a lot of flavor and a good kick of spiciness!"}
{"text":"This place had a cool atmosphere and the calamari was probably some of the best I've had. The reason I give them 3 stars is because of the pricey soft shell crab sandwich that had too much bread and came with about a quarter of the ACTUAL crab in it. I was really looking forward to that sandwich after the good appetizers we had (calamari & Gator) but unfortunately left disappointed. I would try this place again though..."}
{"text":"This place ROCKs!!  I had the shrimp trifecta medium with 1 potato and 1 corn.  Comes in a bag of deliciousness.  Make sure you wear the bib that comes with your service.  It's awesomly messy good stuff!!  They have all kinds of other goodies , so check out the full menu and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I went to this place as part of my monthly east valley dining out group as it came highly recommended by the person who organizes our dinners. Even though we arrived as a party of 12, they still would not take a reservation even though they were aware well in advance that we would be there. So, after about a 45 minute wait, we were finally seated.......and that's when the \"fun\" began. 

It took about 20 minutes just for drinks to be served...and only sporatically. I myself had to ask for my iced tea twice as well as asking for sweet & low and lemon, twice. I believe it took the waitress about 20 minutes just to take our orders. Orders came out incomplete, missing items, some appetizers burnt beyond comsupmtion. I ordered the blue crab as did another member of our party. We each had a \"dead\" crab, meaning no meat inside. To compensate, they substituted the dead crab with a pound of snow crab legs. Come to find out, they simply canceled the Blue crab order @ $13.25 & charged for the snow crab @ $15.00. I felt this was unfair as it was not my fault the 2nd crab was bad. 

To top off the dining nightmare, one person in our party was charged for the entire party on his debit card. They voided it and then charged the correct amount but in the meantime, there was almost $300.00 on my friends account being held hostage for someone's stupid mistake of not paying attention to what the hell they were doing. It had an atmosphere more like a sports bar than a restaurant. The food was......meh at best. I would recommend if trying your luck at this place, to pay in cash. Otherwise, you'll be left broke till they decide what the mistake was and fix it."}
{"text":"For a new location I was very impressed..there was 6 of us & we all tried a little bit of everything..my catfish was huge & cooked Texas right..crab legs were moist in the bag as were the veggies..not a fan of the slaw ..but everything else was delightful if you don't mind a little down home messiness with a bib provided..Best of all..our server Matthew was informed, funny , efficient ...& didn't hesitate to hand over the markers when I asked to mark the wall with a K.C. arrowhead by the Broncos..kudos.. Good luck..we'll be back."}
{"text":"Literally one of the worst restaurants I've been to in my life. I went there with my parents for dinner. Both my mom and I each got the dungeness Crab and my dad the 1/2 slab of ribs. They don't bring everything out at once , so my dad is done with his ribs before the crabs even show up.
2 bags of crabs and one bag of vegetables are dropped on the table.
all of it is drowning in sauce. So much so it seeps through the bag as it's delivered and it will get over everything.  So much sauce you can't tell what the vegetables are. 
Now how to eat it?? They give a nut cracker and hammer and plastic cutlery. First crab place in my life that expects you to use a plastic fork to get the meat out of the crab, no seafood forks. What to do with a bag of drowning vegetables to share - pass the bag back and forth? 
We ask for a couple of plates to dump the vegetables out and thefirst waitress  says sure and then never returns. We ask a 2nd waitress for plates and then are told that they don't have plates. 
All the main dishes are served in plastic baskets, I get that. But when in your life do you walk into a restaurant and ask for a plate and get told that they don't have any to give out for your use and then condescendingly asked \"are we ok with that\". What do you respond to a waitress telling you they don't have plates.
So how did the waitress think we were going to share a bag of vegetables drowning in sauce? Pour it out onto our on table? Pass it back and forth and take turns feeding from the trough? 

Even though this is a bbq and crab place where they give you bibs to wear while eating the crab, at the end they don't bring you a wet nap towelette? 
Have the owners never walked into a joe's crab shack or any bbq place in their life? 

So your hands are stained from the sauce and crab , and the restaurant seems not to notice or care. So you can just go to the washroom to clean up or use the bizarre hand washing sink that sits in the middle of the dining room?
The service is slow and rude, and only serve to make your experience worse."}
{"text":"First time trying angry crab. I had the alligator my boyfriend had shrimp, corn, potatoes, and sausage. Cajun seasoned with the heat level at 5. Scorchin scorpion! We were both beyond satisfied! It was amazing. The Cajun mayo that came with my gator was delicious. The potatoes salad as well. I highly recommend this place to everyone. We plan on returning every trip we make out that way!"}
{"text":"AWESOME food and customer service. Closest thing I can get to home:-) Thanks Angry Crab!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there and ordered the Craw Fish Po-Boy. The fries were warm at the best, the craw fish was cold and mushy. The sauce was not what I would call 'traditional' what so ever and I did not care for it.

I cannot recommend it at this time and may never go back regardless how much I love seafood."}
{"text":"Amazing food, awesome atmosphere and great service! Would recommend to anyone looking for great seafood and a yummy boil!"}
{"text":"Ok so I am not a big fan of shellfish like crab and lobster. My husband loves it though which is why we went. I had been there before and ordered the alligator which was the worst I've EVER had. It was very tough and chewy. I didn't eat it. 
Today though, DH ordered the crab legs and I ordered the vegetables. Both came in a bag with our chosen spices and spiciness level. He liked his order but I was shocked that the liquid in the bag was entirely OIL. I thought the bags were for steaming (as in water), not boiling in hot oil. 
I will say that the veggies were delicious, with a good variety (mushroom, squash, broccoli, etc). The flavor was good. The hushpuppies were DELICIOUS! 
I know that this is a seafood restaurant and I didn't order any, so I won't be to harsh. My biggest gripe is the liberal use of oil and fat. Would it be possible to actually STEAM the foods and serve a side of butter? 
I would come back again because the employees were nice and they have veg options but will specify when I order not to drench my food in oil."}
{"text":"The decor is awesome. Fun atmosphere. Dont plan on using utensils, this is a hands-on experience. My girlfriend and I split the Cajun Fries for an app and for the entree I got a steam bag with 1lbs of shrimp with the heads on and their sausage add-in with the Trifecta seasoning and medium spice. There were 14 huge shrimps! I was so full. My girlfriend got the steam bag with a 1lbs. Dungenese crab (But there was some miss-communication and the waitress said there was only a 1.47lbs crab left for the night cuz it was so busy so we said that is fine but on our bill we were charged for a 2.1lbs crab. Not sure why or how that worked being she didnt want THAT much crab as she only want 1lbs and got 1.1lbs more than expected) and sausage. Also very very good tho. We each got an alcoholic drink and our bill was $80 or so. Not bad. Would have been in the high $60's if not for the extra 1.1lbs crab at market price. We will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Wow, strike 2! I want so much for this place to be great but they fall just short each time! This time I was looking for some great fried shrimp because I just haven't found any in the Phoenix area. What I was served instead was Costco (seriously) frozen fried shrimp and luke warm, limp Cajun fries wannabes. Maybe I should go there for the BBQ???"}
{"text":"Every time I visit, I spend more without guilt. It's worth the experience. Please continue to be customer centric!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great to have dinner or lunch. Fun atmosphere, tasty food and a new favorite of ours. Not a fancy place, very relaxed and easy going. Start with #2 spice. King crab is great, snow crab is very good, shrimp is good. Trifecta sauce is good at #2. Hush puppies are delicious as well. 

Very very good place. Call ahead to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"We had an absolutely perfect meal.  The service was impeccable.  Our server, Rachel, took the time to help us with every item.  I am a seafood connoisseur and usually travel to Florida for it.  The King Crab, Dungeoness and Shrimp were perfection.  Don't miss the Cajun fries either.    Go, now!  This is a must for seafood lovers."}
{"text":"Myself and a friend. 4 pounds of Kings, 3 pounds of lobster, 8 sausages, medium trifecta sauce. Outstanding........great spice, good beer.  Left in a coma. Will go back every chance I get."}
{"text":"Love this place! The bartenders are the best ! Nate and Allison are amazing....food is great, drinks are great, love it!"}
{"text":"Very loud ~ Quality of food, think Long John Silver's fast food restaurant and you will feel right at home."}
{"text":"Went to angry crab for the second time in the past two weeks. Decided to try the Mesa location with a group of friends and was once again disappointed because of the service. We had a party of 19 and our server had the hat with black hair. She was just short and had a bit of an attitude with a couple eye rolls. We were definitely not impressed. However, the food was delicious! It came out in perfect time and was very yummy! (As expected)"}
{"text":"Walked into angry crab the other day and was immediately let down by the unwelcoming host. We were not greeted and when we were sat and asked for a booth we received an eye roll and sigh. Our server was slow and acted so busy when she only had about 3 other tables. Not impressed either. Another disturbing thing was hearing the young host talk about sex and other inappropriate topics  with other co workers.... we sat at the booth near a window closest to the stand and she talked very loud. She looks under age, the white girl with brown hair. I'm not sure what kind of people Angry Crab hires but they are very unprofessional. The food was amazing. I'll only order take it from now on if I ever decide to get their food again"}
{"text":"This is the BEST seafood and BBQ place around! The seafood was cooked perfectly, seasoned to perfection and was amazingly portioned. If you're looking for melt in your mouth BBQ come here! I almost had to be carried out I was so full. Not a single person in the restaurant wasn't smiling. Incredible atmosphere and service I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I stopped in to the angry crab a few days ago over the weekend and this time was exceptionally awesome! Shout out to Vann for entertaining us! He also was equally as helpful as he was funny! We tried eating our seafood like he suggested over RICE! I will never come in for seafood and have it any other way! Thank you Angry Crab! U never disappoint !!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here before and it was good. This time was a horrible experience. Our waitress rang in the order no big deal people make mistakes. She did own up to it. However she tried to force the mistaken order on me. Since then we didn't even see her. Never checked up on us or anything just terrible. I did get my order finally but it took a while. They also screwed up on both my wife and mine order. I order potato salad she ordered coleslaw well they mixed those up. I'm not sure if we will return or not. Needless to say I'm not happy about my experience here"}
{"text":"This place is great. We ordered the snow crab with the trifecta seasoning, sausage, and a 3 on spicy. I had cornbread on the side. My fiance said the wings, which he ordered at a 5 for spicy level, were the hottest he's had in the valley. The food was great and the staff is always very nice and outgoing. It's no wonder the place is so busy all the time."}
{"text":"If I could give them no stars, I would... My fiancé called in her to go order, we went to pick it up & find out that they had given it away to another customer??? They did ask if we wanted to reorder but what's the point?! We called ahead for a reason! If we wanted to wait we would've just drove there and waited in the first place! Not only was it super inconvenient, it was super disappointing! That's all she talked about for a week! And then this??? Not happy... not going back..."}
{"text":"We have been to Angry Crab Shack twice now and sat the bar.  The bartenders were very attentive and the food quality and portion sizes was great.  The gumbo was superior to that of Flavors of Louisiana and the shrimp options are very good.  Great to have some seafood restaurant options in the West Valley.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Our family really likes going here. Very kid friendly, fresh and delicious food, always great service, and good prices. We really love the Catfish and the fries that come with are arguably the best fries on the planet! The crab, shrimp, and all the other fresh seafood is delicious! We will be returning regularly!"}
{"text":"I had one lb of shrimp (heads removed +$2) flavored with trifecta and medium. The taste was pretty good. A little spicier than I thought medium would be though. I also had one lb of blue crab. This I was not impressed with growing up in Maryland I know exactly how the consistency of the crab meat should be and this wasn't it. You also only  get two crabs for $13 back in Maryland you can get a whole dozen for two dollars more however this is the west coast so I get it. All in all  I enjoyed the shrimp I wouldn't get the crab again maybe crab leg or muscles in addition to the shrimp next time. The corn and potatoes were also pretty good The server was average but nice I guess."}
{"text":"Awesome, incredible food. Different yet fun and so good. Ask for surfer Jeff. He had my family rolling in laughter. Unbelievable knowledge and service. Our kids ask every day if we can go see Jeff at angry crab. I don't write reviews. But   only because of this incredibly awesome night out, thanks Jeff and you rock \"angry crab\""}
{"text":"This place is awsome from the wait staff to the food 
I'm from Port Aransas TX.  To get the same quality of food here in Phoenix they get 11 on a scale from 1 to10 an when I left I was full the portions are big 
Every thing that came out of the kitchen was hot an very good. Every one needs to try this place if you want really good food........."}
{"text":"Very yummy Cajun food. The trifecta shrimp and Cajun fries were awesome. Definitely ask for salt, pepper,  and lime to dip the shrimp. PS.... prepare to work for your food."}
{"text":"The location and the look from the outside make you rather skeptical about this place, but oh boy, the seafood here is great!! Trifecta sauce FTW. Will come back often!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner at Angry Crab Shack tonight. Had a great time, staff is awesome, good is great and we're happy they are in Ahwatukee!!"}
{"text":"Went to this place while I was visiting a friend. She just moved to Mesa and we were hungry and yelped restaurants in the area and BAM! Great food. Cool and laid back atmosphere. I only gave it 4 stars because some of our clams were not open when we got them BUT everything else was fantastic! We ordered 1lb snow crab legs, 1lb Dungeness crab and 1lb of clams with medium trifecta(on recommendation from a yelp reviewer). Amazing! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"We had lunch there yesterday. It was AWFUL! We were doing business after so we didn't want a messy basket, plus they didn't have crawfish. We ordered the gumbo- came out lukewarm- server graciously reheated it but it had 2 shrimp and 2 slices of sausage. It was all soup and rice. We love gumbo and this was disappointing. Then we ordered the soft shell crab. It was so over breaded that you could not taste any crab. By far, the worst we have ever had anywhere. We then decided to try the fried shrimp, again, over breaded and not good. 

We paid $40 for the lunch with tip and left very dissatisfied. The food was unappetizing and we had stomach aches all afternoon and evening. We will never go back.

We will go back to Hot and Juicy for sure however. It seems as if this management is distracted away from fish with BBQ."}
{"text":"By far the best Seafood place I had in Arizona! Boyfriend and I went there last night for the first time. We had Crab, Shrimp, corn, sausage and potatoes all mixed into yummy goodness called the Trifecta! There frog legs were amazing and tasted them for the first time there. I can not forget the Oysters...they were so delicious! I've definitely will be spreading the word about this place! We Will be back for sure! Great Service!"}
{"text":"Great environment, awesome fries, gumbo is good, wings are great and crispy. Love how many choices on seasoning there is...anything from hella hot to the faint at heart. Will definitely return. Staff is very welcoming and helpful."}
{"text":"SPICY kicked up seafood !!! This is not your typical seafood boil. And they have delicious sides that are not over priced. You choose the seafood you want (by the pound), what seasoning you want it in, and how spicy. We got shrimp and mussel in the trifecta seasoning with medium spice. Waitress warned me that their spice level is higher than normal and I made the mistake of ordering medium. My stomach was on fire and had acid reflux all night, BUT the experience was worth it. Next time getting mild.  Super affordable dinner, our bill was only $43 with tax and we got: 1 lb shrimp, 1 lb mussel, 2 Budweiser, bread, gumbo, spicy fries, and cheesecake. Crazy !!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last week and it was great! I was disappointed because they were out of a lot of things but we ordered shrimp, muscles and lobster. We had the trifecta sauce and mild seasoning. I would definitely come here again and try other things. Be prepared to get messy!!!!"}
{"text":"We have been frequenting Angry Crab in Ahwatukee for the better part of a year.  Great atmosphere, even better crab.  The thing I appreciate is consistency and the crab has been perfectly boiled and of high quality every visit.  You will be hard pressed to find crab as fresh as this anywhere else in Arizona.  Beyond the crab, the raw oysters on the half shell are some of the best I have had anywhere.  This has been confirmed by one of my east coast buddies that says they are top notch!  The hushpuppies are also a must have.  The alligator bites have been sampled numerous times and that is the only thing that I would give a hit or miss.  Sometimes they are amazing and others they are a total miss; typically, overcooked.  As for the BBQ, take a pass here, it's not bad, I just think there are much better places to enjoy great BBQ.  Spend your money on what you come to a place like this for............. great seafood.  For me this would almost qualify as a go out of my way restaurant.  Nothing fancy, but a fun atmosphere with great food.  A little secret, the vegetable boil is amazing; get it with the trifecta spiced at a 2 and you won't regret the choice.  Oh and you are going to get messy, get over it.  They have hand washing stations in the dining room to take care of the wonderfully sticky buttery hands after a fabulous meal."}
{"text":"Loved the food - I have had king crab legs, mussels and shrimp with the trifecta seasoning medium.  All of it was delicious.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I must say the seafood here is very good. We had the Snow crab and the Dungeness crab. In fact my youngest daughter is still playing with the Crabshell which I think is hilarious lol! With the set up is very nice and very spacious. The hostess greeted us within 20 seconds of walking in the door and we were sitting at a table with our food ordered in 10. I'm pleased with the service that we received here on Father's Day. 

Now on to the food! I love how well they cook the crab and how easy it was to find the meat inside the Crabshell.  The seafood was very good quality. As a black man I must say that I grew up on cornbread and I like my cornbread sweet. The cornbread they have here was virtually the equivalent to the corn bread that I grew up on it definitely made me feel like I was back home eating a hot moist piece of cornbread. 

If you haven't been to angry crab I would strongly suggest getting up out of your seat after you read my review and head straight over to this restaurant to get you some good food!"}
{"text":"My first post, but I just had to write a review of this restaurant, although I know the more good reviews it gets, the longer the waiting time will be.  I'm glad we now have a seafood joint similar to Boiling Crab in AZ! It was a wonderful experience eating here. We loved the nice print of the disposable table sheet. We also loved the shrimp and blue crab.  When we dined there, they were having a special: buy 1 lb of blue crab, get half lb free. We got the trifecta sauce which is a glorious mix of Cajun seasoning, lemon pepper and garlic butter sauces. You have to shake the bag because the Cajun is a tad too salty, and if you don't mix the sauces, it just sits on top of the shellfish and would not taste good. I loved the garlic butter sauce sitting under all that crustacean goodness.

For those who don't eat seafood, they also have chicken tenders; perfect for kids.

Overall experience was super! We will be back for more."}

Watch out for the #2 sauce... Just sayin!
 For those of you who are wimps out there,  it's going to hurt you. 

Restaurant .... Fabulous, clean, succulent"}

{"text":"Went to Angry crab yesterday with 5 other people. 
Service was excellent and the Shrimp was delicious.  
However for a big and busy restaurant with delicious shrimps, they should serve better
Brand rice. Their rice is one of the cheaper brand 
available. Spoiled the meal. 


Please don't try to save by serving cheap brand rice.  Please please please. 

Thanks"}
{"text":"Drove from Chandler to try Angry Crab and BBQ because it just opened recently.  I was the first customer when they opened at 11 am.  I ordered the shrimp , same one I always ordered at their branch in Alma.

I ordered the rice on the side. Rice was hard and not fresh ( at  11 AM?).  I told the waitress who is very friendly,  she took it back and called the manager.  I told them both that: the rice that they served was what looked like their left over from the nite before. I said your chef decided to sprinkle the old rice with water to make it softer and then warmed it up and served it to customers until it is gone.  They did not deny it and apologized. The chef could not find their lid to the rice cooket that morning and was not able to cook rice.  They made me wait 20 minutes so that they can cook fresh rice. I did wait.

If they are serving left over rice from the nite before (rice is cheap ) to customers,  what other left over food in the menu are they serving during the first couple of hours that the restaurant open the following day?  

Really , if you ordered anything in the menu that is loaded with SAUCE,  can you 
tell if it is fresh once they pour the sauce over?   It makes me believe that they will  try to serve left over  sea food to customers especially the COST of shrimp is way over the cost of rice. 

Because of this experience , it just made me think further,  are they also cheating the customers on the WEIGHT of the seafood that they serve? Remember CUSTOMER pays by the weight of crabs, shrimps, crab legs etc.  HmMmm????

Do they charge us by the weight of the sea food before it is cook or after its been cook?  Either way ...... Do they mask their left over food by pouring SAUCE over the dish and no one will know !

{"text":"First time there was for my bday and I can honestly say that it was AMAZING! I ate so much crab that I thought I was going to explode. Food is truly delicious, but I don't recommend the bloody mary... I didn't read the description and was pretty shocked to taste the overwhelming clam taste."}
{"text":"Honestly what's not to like about this place??? The dinning area was nice, clean and roomy with flat screens in every direction. We were welcomed and seated right away with a smile. We were lucky enough to have Michelle as our server. She is professional, friendly and fun. The menu is extensive with different combos. I ordered a Hurricane and they are definitely not stingy with the liquor. All the food was fresh and delicious. I was tempted to order some of everything LOL. It is not cheap but you can find something for every budget. It looked a lot like Hot & Juicy when we looked it up online but they actually have a better menu with items like fried fish baskets and gumbo and they use real butcher block paper rather than the messy plastic that H&J uses on the tables. This will be our regular seafood stop!"}
{"text":"Pretty Damn good. We tried the BBQ that our server Shelby recommended with a couple sides. Food was good and the friendly service was above average. When we come back, we will want to request Shelbys section again. The place is noisy with a lot of energy happening."}
{"text":"Dangerous.  I figured fish/shellfish in the desert was a bad idea.  How could it be fresh and good?

It shouldn't be Angry Crab Shack, but Dangerous Crab Shack.  

As in, Dangerous that you might just keep spending money without thinking because that first crab wasn't enough... and that bag of shrimp was good, but what about a different flavor of crab?  

Four of us needed a break from work after a long day with a client, and someone (okay, it was Derrick) picked this place.  It was a Thursday night, and we had some football to watch, but few did, because we were so focused on the food.

Everything was good.  We had someone who was sensitive to spice, so we had the lowest level available, and the heat kept building.

Make a note that you don't want to wear anything you really like when you come here.  It can be very messy, and greasy as well.  To help with this there is a hand washing station in the main eating area, which his helpful.  

Perhaps the following anecdote will help 

Speaking of the sink washing area,please let me share this little interaction.  One of our group members was washing his hands when a young mother and her daughter were washing up.  The mother was pointing out a spot of red on her daughter's face where she had some sauce.  The sweet little daughter said, \"You have some on your face too mommy.\"  The mother responded, \"No honey, mommy is just a little allergic to shellfish.\"

??!!

My friend had to ask if she was okay.  She said yes, she was fine.  She's allergic to shellfish, but she loves this place so much she heads in, has some crab, and when she starts to feel wrong that's when she gets her bill and goes home for her shot.  Yeah, she goes home for a little epi pen action in the privacy of her own home just so she can enjoy the guilty pleasure of boil in a bag shellfish.

So, yeah, it's really good.  I'll be back.  I'm really happy I don't need an epi pen."}
{"text":"This was the best crab and shrimp!! Be prepared to get dirty, it is sooooo yummy!!! :-)"}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here! Today I had David as a waiter and he was the bomb.com!"}
{"text":"If you want a kick of flavor to your seafood, Angry Crab Shack is just for you! They have great seafood and regular everyday food. Try their Cajun fries! They are to die for! Better than your everyday fries if you ask me! The atmosphere is great and the service is twice as great. They have amazing and friendly servers that make you feel like family. But I do suggest avoiding Fridays from 5-close because it does get busy during that time and the wait can me from 30 minutes+, but it would be worth the wait!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love New Orleans and just got back 6 weeks ago from there. Furthermore, we have a friend who has gone to Angry Crab twice and had nothing but great things to say so we figured we had to give it a shot. 

On the upside, the service was decent and the waitress was attentive. In addition, the Hurricane was authentic and very good. 

On the downside the food was not only bland, the dungeness crab we ordered was terrible. It was both watery and rubbery which is obviously not what you want in your seafood. The crawfish we ordered (we ordered the fresh version, not flash frozen) was also not good. Nothing was cooked in to flavor the food. It was like something was quickly removed from a boiler and then thrown into a plastic bag with a bunch of goop and shaken up. In addition, the two Po Boys we ordered to go (we love real Po-Boys) were flat out inedible and we got home took a few bites and ended up throwing them away. 

After spending $100 and not expecting anything great, we got well below even mediocre and my wife ending up heating up a pizza when we got home. Bottom line, go to this place for the cocktails and bar food, but don't expect real fresh authentic Louisiana style seafood."}
{"text":"Just have come to Angry Crab for the first time but our experience was great.The food is very delicious and the best part of this place is the price is reasonable for us. Absolutely I will go back to here sometimes. Tks guys"}
{"text":"There were quite a few tables open when we arrived but they sat us right next to the door & didn't want to re-seat us. Each time the door opened we got blasted by the 100 degree heat & we couldn't feel the a/c. Then we each ordered appetizers (wings & oysters) & my friend's oysters arrived a good 10 minutes before mine. When we found our server, she said she'd check, but no comments about why we were not served together. When we finished our appetizers we put our dirty napkins on our plates (I had quite a few!) & ordered dinner. I went to the smelly bathroom & noticed there was some air conditioning. It was smelly back there tho. when I got back to our table, I found my left over sauce (that was under my used napkins) back on the table in front of my seat. Yuck! I also found it difficult to crack crab legs with dull scissors & plastic silverware. I've never left so much crabmeat behind. I ended up trying to use my plastic straw to get the meat out. The food was good but the experience was terrible & we won't be returning to this restaurant.

In reading other reviews (albeit too late) it seems that I'm not the only one who didn't get shell \"crackers\" for my crab. The scissors sucked!"}
{"text":"Great, funky Cajun restaurant that's unique to Phoenix.  Have been here multiple times and find myself constantly craving more.  Usually get the shrimp boil w/ red potatoes and sausage w/ a medium spice.  Get a order of their delicious fries and dip them in your left over sauce from the boil.

Reasonably priced, great service, highly recommend.  They don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait on a weekend night."}
{"text":"If you don't mind getting down and dirty with your claws, this place is heaven on earth (I seem to be having this trend of \"heaven\" for some reason). The couple of times I've gone in, I ordered the 1-lb shrimp with trifecta, medium, with white rice and garlic vinegar on the side. I was in a trance until I came up for air. GOD it was so good! They give you a plastic bib so you can eat like a child and splash your family with the juices from shrimp - I'm salivating as I write this - you can even write on the walls if your artistic personality dares to compete with all others who have attempted to be the next Van Gogh. 

**NOTE: I have a high toleration when it comes to spicy foods and I ordered MEDIUM, the constant delicious burn is refreshing. But for some, a ZERO or no spice should be something you could order and maybe ask for the spicy sauce on the side.

For those you are not keen on chomping with their hands, for example, my mother who had a manicure that etched GREEN BAY PACKERS prior to coming here, you can ask for GLOVES to cover your delicate spirit fingers. 

They compost the scraps! I love that! 

I WISH WE HAD ONE OF THESE IN DETROIT AREA! This will definitely be my first stop when I land at PHX!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place and we were not disappointed. We ordered lobster and Dungeness crab and both came out super fresh and well seasoned. The atmosphere was great and there's also a great $5 kids menu. I love that you eat with your hands and no utensils."}
{"text":"Came here for my husbands birthday. The food was very flavorful and portions were big. We had gotten 1 lb. of shrimp with some sausage, potatoes, and corn on the cob with trifecta sauce hot. The shrimp were huge! We also got the full rack of ribs with beans and potato salad. Me and my husband shared both and we were beyond full. Total cost was $43 which was a very good price for the amount of food we got. Service was good and our server was cool. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Horrible!!!!!!!!!!! We sat for 45 minutes before we got our food. And when we did get food we got our entrees before our appetizers. People that came in way after us were getting their appetizers. Asked our waiter & he says let me check. 15 minutes later our food arrives. I think our order was never put in. 

Food not that great."}
{"text":"Not impressed! Walked in and waited to be seated while employees just looked at us. Got seated and took forever to place order. Food was ok, brisket was cold, and the sodas were flat.  Sorry but Joes Crab Shack is way better. Will not return."}
{"text":"Josie is the best server!!! First time here with a group of 5. She provided the best service, so helpful and personable. Hush puppies and char oysters were great app choices. We ordered shrimp, lobster, mussels and crawfish with corn and potatoes. Yummy! I liked the shrimp, lobster and mussels the best with the traditional boil. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I lost a bet and was reluctantly dragged to this restaurant. It had been described by my husband as \"a seafood place where they throw your meal on butcher paper and you eat it with your hands.\" Great. You can imagine my excitement. Turns out I was pleasantly surprised! Yes, things got messy....but we laughed, the service was AMAZING, the drinks were delicious and the snow crab was EXCELLENT. We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"The flavors here can kick Boiling Crab in so Cal's butt! I was here on a quick business visit and found this place on Yelp because it was close by. Man, was I surprised that there's no line and the flavor kicked butt! Will be back again when I'm in Phoenix for sure!"}
{"text":"Kat is the bomb!!! Love the food... love the service. . Definitely will see me here again; )"}
{"text":"Always friendly and fun place to eat! Great eats! Yummy sweet potato fries and coleslaw! The catfish and hush puppies are so good!!!"}
{"text":"So so very disappointed with the service here. Waited at the hostess stand and no one even came over to seat us until 10 minutes later... mind you it was 3pm so it wasn't even crowded. Then they brought the food out 20 min apart from each other! And not once did our waiter check on us"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, I enjoyed the excellent quality food, the service was awesome , happy servers= happy customers, thanks Natasha for make this a great experience. .."}
{"text":"I was wanting oysters on the half.  And I got them! Great service and a pleasant friendly bartender Tracy.  I'll go back!"}
{"text":"First of all let's be honest, this is by far the best idea we have seen in a very very long time. The atmosphere is incredible the food is out of this world and service couldn't be better. For a new restaurant we have been to the one in Mesa at least 50 times. And every single person we bring loves it just as much.
We tried this new one on Ray on Saturday and two days later we are still walking around speechless on how awesome it was. Five stars across-the-board we recommend this place to everybody that likes to enjoy life and have a party in there mouth!"}
{"text":"Wow!!
Unbelievable amazing! Without a doubt the best crab I have ever ate! You can pick from multiple varieties of seafood, then you pick your flavor, (I always pick trifecta), then you pick your level of spice. Watch out number five will get you!
We recommend this to everybody it is amazing amazing amazing!"}
{"text":"We went for our first visit about 8 p.m. on a Sunday night and the wait at that time was 45 minutes.  We said forget it and went back at lunchtime the next day to have snow crab.  Assumed it would be awesome because the place was packed.
 
Pros:  trifecta sauce was very flavorful, service was good,  sides were good, atmosphere was fun.

Cons:  some of the crab was too fishy tasting instead of sweet, crab was drowning in greasy sauce.

For about the same price go to Joe's Crab Shack instead.  :)"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. One of the best places to get down and dirty with seafood. Don't fret though because they have a handwashing station. This means you are not stuck with little alcohol wipes to clean your hands. 

On Mondays, they have 'surprise bags.' It changes every Monday and for $20 it's a pretty good deal. The first time I tried it the bag contained catfish. I had some apprehension at first but it went away fairly quickly. 

If you love seafood and do not mind getting your hands dirty, this is the place to go. Also, don't forget to get their cajun fries. Delicious!"}
{"text":"For my 1st visit I took my mom for lunch on Mother's Day. We had shrimp and snow crab in the Trifecta sauce with mild heat which was delicious and the fried catfish which was the BEST we've had in years! Not only was the food incredible but our service was fantastic!  Susie K was our server and we LOVE her! 
Once I got home I told my kids about our delicious meal and They begged me to take them for dinner so I returned Mother's Day evening and had another fantastic meal with Susie K!
The following Sunday was my and my husband's anniversary and that's where we chose to have dinner. It was his first time there and he loved every bite. This time we had the muscles, the snow crab and the shrimp. Again in the Trifecta sauce. Susie was not working but we had another great server by the name of Jenifur. All and all everything has been fantastic! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Someone hit my wife's SUV by there parking lot. It had nothing to do with them. It was 108 degrees the first time this year. They gave us cold drinks while we waited in there shade. And we had 2 different managers give us there cards for free meals since we had so much stress that day. I won't take them up on it but I appreciate the service they provide for someone who has never been a customer. I am going to eat there tonight and bringing friends. Thanks angry crab."}
{"text":"It's about time the west valley got a decent joint for seafood!!!

The atmosphere was very fun, the service was good, and the experience was excellent.  We've been to similar places out in LA & Angry Crab beat them hands down.  We loved the shrimp, king crab legs, & mussels.  Can't wait to go again & try out the crawfish, too.  We got our bags with sausage, corn, & potatoes...get all three, they're excellent cheap additions.  The sauces were great & the spice levels were solid (we only went as high as 2/med & it was yummy - a proper medium, not a wimpy medium).  The garlic was good, but the trifecta was slightly better.

I would advise new diners to stick to the boiled bags.  We also tried the chicken fingers, gator nuggets, calamari, and fries.  The only fried food that was above average was the calamari, which was actually quite good.

Expect a wait on the weekend, but it's absolutely worth the wait & they roll out the food pretty fast.  The prices are not cheap, but very reasonable for the quality/freshness of the seafood.  

We'll be back again, for sure!"}
{"text":"The only thing that was good about this visit were the writing walls. Our service was mediocre, drinks came out slowly and took forever to be refilled. Not to mention, the smell just walking in was awful. It was an overpowering stale crab smell, which was very off putting to my appetite and I almost walked out just for that. The whole restaurant feels cramped with no room to move in between tables and very hot. Once our food finally started coming, the experience got worse. My table ordered macaroni and cheese that came out cold and didn't look fully cooked. The crab and shrimp bags were alright, however the fried shrimp, calamari, and gator nuggets were awful. They were out of several foods, including brisket and chicken, which was upsetting considering it was a Tuesday night at 6:30. Nothing here was good, especially for the price and we will NOT be back."}
{"text":"Loved the food, the atmosphere, the service!    I will definitely go back!  You need to wear the bib!  Let me repeat...you need to wear the bib!  It's a messy meal but I will gladly eat there over and over again.   The only thing that I am hope for is a location in Chandler.  5 stars!"}
{"text":"My buddy and I will not be returning due to the general attitude of this place. It's more of a sloppy party atmosphere, and somewhat unorganized. Our server had bright green hair, bad attitude, and took 20 mins just to get our lunch when the place was absolutely dead. Our meals were brought at different intervals which made  things kind of awkward. We both ordered beer...&not once did she check our i.d's! Hah my friend is only 19... illegal!!!"}
{"text":"I had the crawfish with the Trifecta sauce and level 3 spice. The crawfish was not great. It didn't taste fresh and texture was a little of putting. The sauce however was delicious. And I was able to try other people food at my table. We had shrimp and king crab. Those were both super delicious and cooked perfectly. I kept mixing it with the sauce over and over again. The food comes in a plastic bag and they have metal buckets to dump your shells. You even have the option to keep the shells and use them as compost. The decor is very divy. Their is weighting ask over the wall by customers so bring your own color shape and leave your tag. Since it is Cajun style food they are big New Orleans Saints fans. They bring out a huge 7 foot doll during games and the place gets really loud during games."}
{"text":"Interesting concept. Food was alright....not awesome, but fair. Stopped in while traveling....like the atmosphere and the no plate get messy and enjoy way of doing things. Had mussels and king crab with the trifecta spice.....would eat here again if for nothing else the fun of it."}
{"text":"Visiting from Chicago for Spring Break and looking for a good meal to celebrate my east coast born & raised husband's birthday request for seafood.  This place was perfect! 

We had very attentive service from Noel and liked that things were done well and quick, especially with a preschooler in tow.  The food was great, prices were fair, and I had a happy hubby when we departed.  We are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I was very excited about my take out order from Angry Crab today but the one item that I looked forward to having most, crawfish, was quite disappointing.

My order included snow crab, shrimp and crawfish. All had good flavors with the trifecta seasoning. The shrimps had a nice crunch and the crab was easy the peel. The 'live' crawfish, on the other hand, was anything but. When placing the order, I specifically asked for live crawfish, which I was told is available for $18 per lb versus $9 for the regular flash frozen variety. When picking up my order, the waitress confirmed that these were 'live' for the charged price. No problem! Happy to pay extra for fresh quality.  

What I'm not happy about is paying double for mediocre food. Crawfish were definitely frozen with a rubbery bite and bad after taste. I don't think they're even worth the regular price. Will be the last time I order crawfish from this establishment."}
{"text":"First timer from SoCal having Father's Day dinner with my Dad and my family! Certainly not the place for anyone concerned about how they look eating in front of others. Cause they don't,....Backyard Family style eating with great food and service. Our waitress, Susan, provided exceptional service along with the food.

We had the shrimp with butter garlic sauce by the pound, king crab legs with the proper tools to extract the meaty contents, gator nuggets ( yes, alligator ) - can I just say excellent and it really does taste like chicken, along with clams and oysters. No doubt, it will be a positive experience when you have a prepared expectation to get messy. Side note, if you wanna \"unplug\" your kids for an actual dinner, this is one way. My teen kids hands were too messy for them to answer their phones, text, etc. we maintained full conversation during dinner.

Overall great seafood dinner experience, keep the positives going and when you get Susan as your waitress, mention she was mentioned on yelp."}
{"text":"Thank you Alexis for great service! Thank you  Angry Crab for some good food! We'll be filing this place under \"Been there, Definately Coming Back!\" Crawfish, Corn, and Red Potatoes were great! BBQ was fantastic too!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and this is clearly one of my favorite places to go to unwind with a drink after work, or a great seafood or BBQ dinner. I have tried many of the items on the menu, and have not been disappointed in any of them. The staff do a great job of taking care of you! Bartenders Miranda & Ralph are always smiling and full of energy and will make sure you receive exemplary service at the bar! The Principals have a definite winner with this concept and are expanding with more locations! If you have a chance to try the Angry Crab shack, Take it!"}
{"text":"OMG the corn bread is so good! 
I got a shrimp bag with potatoes and it was amazing! 
Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love the concept and the food. They do a great job and the wait staff is really friendly. We had Alaskan King crab legs, charred oysters and shrimp. The Angry Crab is for serious crab-smackers. Reminds me of a cross between Maryland crab shacks and Nola- right in Mesa... Nice touch with the Dixieland jazz and swing music. Go there- eat crab- get happy! PS go there with someone you love, this way you won't have to explain the Old Bay on your forehead!!"}
{"text":"I went with family and friends visiting from Colorado. One in my party was from New Orleans and quite a Cajun cook herself. I'm a east coastie and know my seafood well. I ordered a shrimp basket and side of corn. The waitress had a nasty unprofessional attitude and brought the ear of corn out first. I asked her could she please bring it with my meal and she replied \"well, I can leave it here, or take it with me.\" Not wanting to get completely ignorant I told her to indeed take it with her. I was nibbling from everyone else order- WAY OVER COOKED SHRIMP and the \"basket might as well have been a \"Happy Meal.\" I see people are raving about this place but our first choice was Hot N Juicy but we decided to give this place a try. THERE IS NOTHING AUTHENTICALLY CAJUN about this place. Back to Hot N Juicy I go. They treat you well there, the seafood is excellent, not over cooked and the wait staff AWESOME. See ya!
(PS: if a \"NO  STAR\" option was available here, thats what they would have received!)"}
{"text":"So. I'm going to start by saying I can't solely judge my experience based on the taste of the food (even though I wish I could). Well it all started like this. We went in granted a little later then normal. I am being generous and saying about 9pm. Once were seated it took about twenty minutes before anyone acknowledged our presence at our table. (points lost). Then a young friendly woman stopped by and asked if we had been helped we replies no. And her response was \"I guess I can help you.\"  Letting that rude comment go we ordered our drinks and waited to be asked for our food orders. Being that we never been there before we asked it to be explained to us and and she did a good job doing that. Unfortunately everything we wanted to order they \"had just ran out\". Fine ok. But when my wife order sides with her crabs they were forgotten and brought out by themselves plain as heck. No flavor or seasoning. Man. (Points lost) I'll admit it took me about five minutes longer to order what I finally wanted but my food was over 25 minutes later then the rest of my party. (points lost) once it arrives yes the trifecta hot was amazing but the experience was killing my intent to ever come back. The last thing that was upsetting was how many waiters and waitresses were just standing around and talking with each other laughing and \"dancing\" while showing each other their phones while waiting for service. Angry crab I really wanted this to be a home run but man was I disappointed. I guess it's back to joes!!"}
{"text":"We went here last Saturday afternoon and were a party of 4. I liked the menu and the prices seemed fair.
We each ordered something different off he menu. I orders the Crawfish Poboy roll with corn of the cob. The brought the corn on the cob first without my meal. All 4 orders were served at different times and the last person wasn't served until we were finished eating.
My roll was stale and couldn't be eaten. Very disappointed. We did go to Dairy Queen afterwards for a Blizzard."}
{"text":"What a shame! Even the sausage added to our shrimp was not the same snappy polish sausage as before. It was limp and tasted washed out. The trifecta sauce lost its flavor and all that's left is oiliness. The fried clams were just fried breading. Be careful as the shrimp were not deveined. The Alaskan crab legs were over cooked. Man, what a shame! I used to love this place!"}
{"text":"A little pricey which is why I chose 4 stars. Went on a Friday around 4pm seated right away. Server was very nice and helpful. Food was great! Hush puppies bomb!  Had lobster/shrimp/king crab with trifecta seasoning great combo be prepared to get dirty! They do have a near by hand washing spot great idea! I will be coming back to try other combos!"}
{"text":"Came in with a party of 9.. Had a blast. Little Miss Jordann took care of us and so did they bartender Jeffro. Food was on point as always. Can't go wrong with the shrimp, snow crab, hush puppies, pizza, calamari, mussels, brisket, cheese cake and chocolate cake with ice cream. Safe to say we had a little bit of everything. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Food is good make sure you don't wear your favorite shirt, because it gets a bit messy. Ordered the lobster with Cajun spice and angry ghost heat. It was good not to hot, next time will order the scorching scorpion."}
{"text":"So I have to try and NOT think about this place on a constant basis.  Finally tried the Gumbo, I now dream about it. The service is always accommodating, fast, and super nice. Food is beyond amazing, incredibly fresh (we get the 1/2 doz oysters every time). Trifecta is a must, heat is up to you. Say Hi to Cody at the bar. The guy is a fantastic bartender, always on point. Love, love, love this place!"}
{"text":"Ooh la la!! Try the crab with the trifecta sause *cajun, garlic, lemon pepper*. My mouth is still zinging with joy, and I may wait to brush my teeth! Server was thorough, friendly, and knowledable. WIll go back for sure.  Priced better than Joe's crab shack."}
{"text":"I haven't been here, made this review on accident. Since there's no option to delete a review I'm stuck."}
{"text":"I love the trifecta 3 seasoning combo w/ shrimp and snow crab! Calamari sticks are tasty as well. My gf and I eat there at least twice a month:)"}
{"text":"Best shrimp since leaving the Texas gulf coast! Shelby ( our waitress) was the best! Everything was awesome! Great food, service, and atmosphere! Moving into the area soon and will be a steady customer! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Who wouldn't love a bag of boiled shrimp or lobster dropped in front of them?  Drowning in whatever seasoning and butter you selected. Make sure your plastic bib is on right because you will feel like a toddler in a high chair getting to play with your food.  It's a delicious and fun culinary adventure."}
{"text":"Well, the bag of seafood they give you comes out to not much,.soggy but good taste,.just not enough, dont know it they weigh it down with the juices or what but its hard to crack open king crab legs soggy! Its way too expensive and think joes crab shack is better, you get more for less,the only good thing is that they have frog legs, but way to expensive and .ot enough!!"}
{"text":"My husband loves the frog legs and the seafood is a huge draw, but the BBQ is Outstanding!!!!! Wish they had it at the MESA location. We will be back for that killer brisket!"}
{"text":"I am from New Orleans, so when I asked the waiter if the boiled shrimp and crawfish were boiled true N'awlins style, he said Absolutely.  Bottom line either he lied or was misinformed. In N'awlins we add all of our seasonings into the water BEFORE adding the seafood... That way the shrimp/crawfish can absorb the seasonings as they are going through the boiling process... The end result is spicy flavor all the way through.  This is NOT what they served me.  What they did was boil the shrimp and crawfish in regular water (without seasons added)... After removing the seafood from the unseasoned water they placed it in a bag, added their mix of seasonings to the bag, and basically shook it up... The end result is that the SHELL of the shrimp or crawfish had alot of seasoning on it... But WHO EATS THE SHELLS???  The meat inside was still flavorless (unless I happened to have a little seasoning stuck on my fingers from peeling off the shells).  This place is call the ANGRY CRAB, but all it did was make me SAD.  :-("}
{"text":"I don't typically leave reviews but I LOVE this place.  I eat here at least a few times a month.   If your ok with good getting your hands messy and eating with a bib... You can't go wrong.  The wait staff is usually good and very personable and the food is consistently good... 10+ times and never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. First we get there around 830 pm on a Sunday so we expected a wait, it really didn't take that long. I love that they text you when your table is ready. Our server was awesome and at one point the manager even came by the table to check on everyone and make sure nothing else was needed. We ordered 3 lbs of shrimp 3 sausages and 1 corn on the cob. OMG it was delicious we got the trifecta sauce medium and it was perfect!"}
{"text":"Just left there Amazing place SHRIMP is to die for trifecta sauce is the way to go!!  Service is good. Hope it stays around!!"}
{"text":"I have been here three times now(within a week) and tried three different kind of crabs so far(their blue crabs were sold out). As you may tell, I am a seafood lover. I love their sauce, and I think it's my favorite part of their food. I cannot handle spicy so I only ordered their mild trifecta. I'll m1. Snow crab legs: they were good, but due to the nature of the crab, the sauce are completely on the shell and the meat is lacking of the flavor. I have to dip the meat in the sauce. Also, the sauce were not a lot, so I ended up having them to add some more sauce for me. my suggestion would be maybe crack the shell a little bit so they sauce can get into the meat. 2. Dungeness crab: They are huge, I got one that was 1.8 lbs. I think it is decent. However, it was very fishy without sauce, almost like it's bad(It's not bad, the crab meat was still very tasty). I understand sea crabs can be more fishy than lake/river crabs, but I think it was also because the sauce was not absorbed into the crab.  3.Hardrock crab legs: Honestly, that might be my favorite. The crab meat were firm and they were not fishy. The meat even carried a little bit sweetness. I loved it. 4. Char'd oyster. They were really good. The garlic/butter sauce with it was on point and they were tasty. 5. Shrimp: Shrimp tasted good, and the sauce was actually get into the shell, so it was tasty.
Their staff was very nice too. However, on my second visit, the computer messed up my bill so I was charged $10 extra. I figured out right away and corrected it. If people were going there, make sure their computer calculated your bill correctly."}
{"text":"This is a true crab shack. The food is reasonably priced, the Flavors are exceptional. I would recommend to anyone. This is not a fine dining experience, it is casual place to have a beer and enjoy a pile of great tasting food with friends."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place since they have been open, and finally was able to last night. And let me tell you, this place is amazing!!! The food is super fresh and cooked just right! I had my crawfish with the ghost spice on it and holy cow it was hot! But it was tasty. My favorite place for seafood by far. Will come back and bring more people."}
{"text":"We came to celebrate my parents anniversary. My entire family & friends had an Awesome time. The food was delish & wait staff was friendly except sometimes it takes awhile for her to bring out our missing sides and additional stuff what we asked for but overall Great place to eat."}

Also the food and service is outstanding,
You guys keep up the good work!
Excellent place to go."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and enthusiastic servers! Love the concept...expect to get messy but your tummy will love the yummy food."}
{"text":"Since seeing Hot & Juicy on the Food Networks, Man vs. Food, I've been a fan of this style of seafood dining. I've been to Boiling Pot in California & Hot & Juicy in Las Vegas & Angry Crab definitely fits the bill & hold a bright torch to its comparisons to the others. Our waitress Michelle was energetic & very informative to the choices on the menu. Michelle added her 5 Star service to the 5 Star food. I thoroughly enjoyed my first visit & anticipate many more. Many of my co-workers & friends we're waiting to hear about my visit & with my pleasant experience, they too will now be future patrons."}
{"text":"It was quite the experience... A must try but don't where anything nice. lol as it will get filthy... Great price for what you get..."}
{"text":"I've been to this location three times now. I'm not a huge seafood guy my my fiancé is. That aside. I don't find myself turning down an opportunity to come here. The soft shell crab sandwich was great! Fried alligator was very tasty. Very large portion as well. Good mix of craft and domestic beers. On one visit Grand Canyon Brewing Co was there just for ordering one of their beers we received some \"swag\" beer pint glass stickers lanyard. It was refreshing to see local businesses stick together. All and all. Service is good, food is great, as well as the list of cocktails and beers. Will definitely return again."}
{"text":"I normally don't like to give restaurants a bad review but this one had horrible service and food. Visited them on 1/28 waited 15 minutes for the waiter to come. Ordered crawfish , shrimp and raw oysters. Crawfish and shrimp came first but oyster wasn't until the end of the meal when I reminded them. The food was mediocre, I've been a fan of crawfish and love hot and juicy as well as boiling crab. This is not even in the same category . The sauce was decent but there was no flavor penetrated in the actual meat. It was bland and I could probably do a better job at home. Sad to see such a close by crawfish restaurant be a let down. I will travel to Tempe or California for my next crawfish cravings."}
{"text":"I took my son here and he is a very picky eater for a 10 year old. We were seated right away. He loved the idea of being able to write on the wall and the table and not get in trouble. This was my second time here and his 1st. We sat down and almost right away Dawn (our server) came over with a smile to take our order and ensure that we were taken care of. She was amazing! The service was great, the food was incredible and she actually was even able to convince him to try the crab. Would absolutely recommend going there and you must ask for Dawn!!!! It's an experience."}
{"text":"Food is always great. It's quick hot and delicious and friendly waiters and waitresses. We go there at least 2to3 times a mo."}
{"text":"My husband and I are from east coast ocean locations and finding really good seafood has been a challenge. If we find a restaurant with good seafood it's prices are out of this world, and if we find a restaurant that is reasonably priced the seafood is sub-standard.Then we found the Angry Crab Shack.The service was so fantastic!!! The food was great! I have to mention that they have the most incredible baked beans I have ever eaten!!! I actually had a get together that required baked beans, so,I went to the Angry Crab Shack and bought 4 large containers of baked beans from them(no I didn't take credit for making them Ha Ha). Everyone wanted to know where I got them, so, I told them...they were shocked! I just know that these Atlantic Ocean and Chesapeake Bay originals are glad the Angry Crab Shack is in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I've lived In Phoenix for the past 18 months and been looking for a place like this my entire time I've been here. Reminds me of Florida where I lived for 14 years and going back to next week for good. The décor the set-up of the restaurant reminds me of Florida. Most of all the food reminds me of Florida. I had 2 servings of the raw oysters, the brisket/rib combination with corn and baked beans and it was soooo good! The brisket literally melts in your mouth when you bite into it. I had the jalapeno (level 2) sauce and it gave it that extra kick which really set off the flavor of the meat. My GF had the salmon with rice and hush puppies. The salmon was pretty close to perfect with white rice and came with coleslaw. All was really good. Our server was Lexie (?) who was very knowledgeable and accommodating and believed in the product she was selling. For being on the job for a week she was very professional and knew her job. My only regret was that I didn't find this place sooner as I would be here two-three times a week."}
{"text":"Had dinner at this location last night, the restaurant location is in a bad spot, back in the corner of a strip mall. The lighting could be better the stark light bulbs from Home Depot ceiling fans didn't work for me, an upgrade here could make the experience much better from the get-go. But the big ass fan is very cool. I had oysters on the half sell, not good room temp and chewy. Moved on to the the mussels, very different than I have had in the past, large and a little chewy again, went with the 3rd level non butter seasoning not bad. We then order the ribs, little dry but tasty, had a couple of sauces on the side that helped out, I did like the Sauces. One suggestion, get rid of the incredibly cheap plastic flatware and awful paper plates, that would like the lighting really help the overall experience. The foot is not bad, but between the two of us we still drop $80 with tip, it's not cheap and that included 2 beers and one glass of wine. I might go back, but the place does not call me back by any means."}
{"text":"Beautiful sway to spend a Saturday afternoon.... Drinking a nice brewskie and yum yum crab....life is Good my Friends...!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed Angry Crab and BBQ. It has a casual atmosphere with good music. We sat outside and enjoyed the breeze. The spice level is higher than normal, but they warn you. I will add, the spice level matters more if you order the veggies. They soak it up more than the crustaceans, so I'd go one down on your veggies. Great flavors. They were out of crawfish, so I had the shrimp with trifecta sauce. They don't do half pounds or mix and match, so come hungry! Service was great too."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I strongly recommend the amber mule and crab legs. If you like good food this is the place to go to."}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Service, fun atmosphere...What more could you ask.  We started off with 2 dozen raw.  Yummy! then we had the angry baskets.  I had catfish and hubby had shrimp.  The potato salad was so tasty and the spicy frys  amazing.  Fun place they offer seafood boils and they have bibs for the messy fingers.  they have a great wash up station right there in the restaurant.  Fun and great food."}
{"text":"OK food and service, it is a much bigger place than Hot'N'Juicy.

Either great or bad, don't mind stopping by when in that area"}
{"text":"Awesome! Staff is always nice and informing. My favorite restaurant. The food is the best seafood in town."}
{"text":"Stopped here on my way out to California for a quick bite.
Ordered 1 pound of shrimp and 1 pound of crawfish.
Shrimp were a good size, around 21/25 ct. Good flavor and heat. Crawfish were good size but lacking flavor, need more soaking time.
All in all,  I thought the place was good and I would come back...Often if I lived close by."}
{"text":"Came back for dinner once again.  The food is very addicting.  Ordered 3 bags of shrimp 2 with trifecta 0 and one with trifecta 1.  Also had the salmon and catfish and hush puppies.  Can't go wrong with the food.  Only complaint was that it was extremely hot in the restaurant.  Our server kept our ice water full"}
{"text":"Great shrimp and snow crab - I love the hush puppies!!  We kept it simple and had the Kajun seasoning with a #2 medium heat.  We sat at the bar and had very good service.  This place really never disappoints.
Love this place!! MIKE DEL TORO is a great bartender and his drinks rock."}
{"text":"Came in with my girlfriend and our server Allison was very knowledgable and friendly. She even popped our crab open for us! The food was fantastic and full of flavor. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Vann was patient and knowledgable"}
{"text":"Good food priced by the pound!
great service
good location 
lots of parking"}
{"text":"First time here. It was great. I had the trifecta boil bag with shrimp and it was awesome. Our server Alex was great also. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate my birthday with family from out of town. We are all seafood lovers but its hard to find done well in AZ. The location isn't the most appealing but the food and atmosphere make up for it. 
We were worried about getting a table for 9 without reservations but a quick conversation with an employee on their Facebook page assured us there would be enough room to accommodate us. 
We arrived around 3 and were immediately seated. The place was busy but not packed. 
Our serve Cody was amazing, helped us with the menu as it was our first time there and was super enthusiastic and entertaining. 
We started with clam strips (the best any of us have ever had), hush puppies (super flavorful and light), and fries. Our drinks were also great, especially the Moscow mule and oyster shooter.
We ordered: fresh oysters on the half shell, mussels with trifecta seasoning and level 2 spice, snow crab trifecta seasoning level 3 spice, snow crab trifecta with level 1 spice, whole lobster trifecta with level 1 spice, grilled salmon and rice for the kid in the group and the grilled oysters on the half shell with garlic and cheese. 
The fresh oysters were delicious and not at all fishy, same for the mussels. The seasonings were strong and the sauce left in the bag was tasty. The level 3 spice is SPICY but great. Level 2 was moderate enough for most of us. All of the food was cooked to perfection but I cannot say more positive things about the char grilled oysters on the half shell. We started with half an order and they were gone in under a minute and we immediately ordered a dozen more. All of our food was great but I would make the trip just for the grilled oysters. The best any of us have ever had.  
SERIOUSLY order the grilled oysters, you will not regret it!
It was my birthday and the staff must have overheard us talking about it and we were brought a complimentary piece of yummy red velvet cake. 
Seafood does not come better than this in AZ.  Go now."}
{"text":"Good family restaurant.  Noisy, very noisy.  Items on the menu were not available.  If you want to eat sloppy, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Awesome service. This is my favorite place to eat in Mesa. Yes it's messy. Yes is a hole in the wall type of set up,  but those are the best types of places! Highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Excellent food, Great Value. 
I love this place but HATE HATE HATE the crappie scribbled on walls for decor.... They need a fabulous gay to redecorate. 
But the food is amazing."}
{"text":"OMG!! Best EVER!!! The trifecta shrimp is THE BOMB! living on the Gulf Coast our entire life, we can honestly say that we had the best shrimp we have EVER eaten Our entire life!! Shelby ROCKED our service... Super sweet, and gave us the 411 on our new 'hood. She is the best!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! We each had the snow crab trifecta and it was great! Very tasty and cooked perfectly. They sell by the pound, and the prices a very reasonable. We ordered a side, but the crab had so much meat, it was unnecessary.

The service was fast, friendly, and very attentive. The atmosphere was very relaxed. The seafood is served in a plastic bag, the tables are covered with paper, and there is a tin bucket for all the trash. 

My issue with this place is the cleanliness. The bathrooms were quite dirty. So were the floors. And the sinks outside the bathroom were also nasty. The lighting is somewhat dim, so I'm not sure about the cleanliness of the rest of the establishment, but I wouldn't bet on it. 

I plan on coming back, but I hope they clean up a bit better. The amount of times I will return fully depends on whether their cleanliness standards improve or not."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD! So many options of seasoning and spice, so there is a fit for anyone. I personally love the shrimp, catfish, and salmon with Trifecta seasoning. Fun environment inside, but also an easy pick up."}
{"text":"Walking in the energy is undeniable. The place looks great and definitely gives me that New Orleans feel. My wife and I were greeted warmly and seated promptly upon arriving. We got there at 4 in the afternoon and it was very busy. Our waiter was Dion, he is an awesome guy. Dion took his time explaining everything on the menu and brought everything before I could ask. I ordered the BBQ pitmasters platter with the #5(Maximum heat) creole Q sauce on the side with cajun fries. My platter choices were ribs, brisket and pulled pork. The ribs were meaty and seasoned just right, the brisket was moist, delicious and gone in seconds and lastly the pulled pork was smoked to perfection. The creole Q #5 is sooooo hottttt, I loved every second of it. I even took the extra sauce home for later. I was so full I had to turn down the desserts that Dion kept tempting me with. I will definitely be back to devour some BBQ and next time some of the yummy seafood (I've had it before too and it's some of the best seafood in AZ) ."}
{"text":"Seafood good if you like Cajun spices. The BBQ however is just NOT good when compared to Joes and other locals. The sides just don't cut it either."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Everything was perfect. And this time we didn't over order. My hubby and I shared king crab legs, muscles and veggie in trifecta sauce no heat. It was outstanding. We went at 4 o'clock on Saturday the day before Father's Day and it was packed. When we left I think the wait was triple time. 

I like the fact that you can download an app on your iPhone it shows you where you are on the waiting list. 

Enjoy"}
{"text":"My sister brought me here for my birthday knowing how much I really love seafood.  The restaurant is located in an old strip mall full of empty storefronts.  That's the only negative thing I can say about my experience.  From the moment I walked in I knew I was in for a treat.  The staff was friendly in a vibrant and genuine sort of way and they come at you with it as soon as you enter the door. At about the same time you are met with a delicious aroma of seasoned seafood.  

We had gumbo, shrimp, and crab.  I generally like spicy food but we decided to get mild seasonings so as not to burn our tongues and fingertips.  This was a very good decision because the seasonings are very spicy anyway.  We enjoyed every bite, every morsel and left the table full of shrimp and crab shells.  We never once had to summon the wait staff because they were always attentive.  

I highly recommend the Angry Crab Shack for their delicsious seafood, excellent service, and friendly staff.  Dress casual for this puppy."}
{"text":"My new favorite sea food restaurant. Tami our waitress was very helpfully and the food was outstanding."}
{"text":"We've been hearing wonderful things about this place.  Decided to check it out for ourselves, NOT DISAPPOINTED!!! The food is AMAZING! Mussels in Pacific Rim boil off the hook!  Waitress Tameisha was so friendly and helpful.  Make it a point to visit soon."}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations. I'm snobby when it comes to seafood but wow! Our server Jeff was awesome and guided us towards the snow crab over the blue crab. Key recommendation. We got it with Trifecta sauce, #2 spice level and it was delicious. The crab was firm, juicy, perfectly cooked, and delicious. Even my husband, who is now a seafood lover, agreed that this was one of our best meals in Phoenix. Hard to get better bang for your buck."}
{"text":"After walking out of the melting pot for poor service we decided to go to the angry crab in the same parking lot. As soon as we sat down at the bar we had coasters and menus being placed in front of us from Jeff. Very welcoming at that. The remainder of the time at the restaurant we enjoyed his company and his phenomenal service. The food was amazing however, his great service alone will bring my family back to the angry crab."}
{"text":"Mmm, so good.  Pricey but its sea food and we are in AZ, what do you expect."}
{"text":"First and Foremost- if you are reading this review I'm going to tell you now, quit debating! Bring your friends and family in and get ready to have the feast of your life!!!-
I am incredibly happy that they opened this location! I brought my fiancé here for his birthday back in October, and had my heart set on coming back this past Friday for mine as well!!! :) I totally love this place! The best cooked Crab Legs, Lobster, gator nuggets and Fried Oysters!!!! Love the LVL 4 seasonings!! Even the level 5, was amazing!! You guys have the best service, and are very friendly!!! 
I am happy and proud to say that I have now found my \"Go to\" Place for Seafood!  This place puts all places to shame!! It is safe to say that Joes Crab Shack has lost a long time customer!! The cooks in charge, are to die for!!!! Way to go guys! 
The Quantity and Quality are properly priced. My kids were over satisfied with their chicken tender baskets and were brave enough to try the appetizers & they loved it! They are requesting to come back for Christmas dinner!! So I hope you guys are going to be up for service!!! Red Velvet Cake was delicious! Overall money well spent! 
Next time, I'll try the coctails. ;) 
 *In my Profession, I come across a lot of people, and will always STRONGLY recommend THE ANGRY CRAB SHACK!!!!*
We'll be seeing you again Very Soon! :)"}
{"text":"Finally and after my first time here 
Thats what I was looking for since I knew The Boiling Crab 
The staff are so friendly 
The Shrimp with 3 kind of sauces was so delicious and very similar to Shrimp Boiling just lighter than it   
Just keep going 
And I would suggest to have half bounds for any orders and thanks"}
{"text":"When I crave for seafood, we go there.. However, some of the young servers are the ones who I have an issue with.... I just wish that since you normally use your hands and get down & messy with your eating style in this place--- That they train their servers to give the checks to the customers when the customers ask for them-- NOT when the people are still eating at the table.  It ruined my lunch today at that place!!!!"}
{"text":"Yelped & found this place a couple wks ago, and have already been 3 times, its now our families sunday tradition for lunch. Extremely laid back atmosphere, incredible customer service, and the spices and seasonings are truly a culinary art. My son loves when they walk around with the lobsters, crawfish, etc, to show the kids."}
{"text":"Food was great, but I was sitting at the bar and I had to listen to all the employees talk shit about each other and then when one would walk away the other would talk shit about the other one. I felt like I was in high school all over again. Don't you have a job to do? Stop sitting and flirting with the \"cute\" bartender and stop annoying your customers"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and it is comparable to boiling crab. The food does exceed the expectations, yeah sometimes they don't put enough sauce, but still the food are delicious.
I would had giving this restaurant five stars without hesitation until last visit.

I live about 40 miles away, drove to Angry Crab with my family. I ordered from the kids menu for my daughter, and I selected milk as a beverage for her. When the milk arrive she started drinking it and she spilled some that I started cleaning out, then I tasted my fingers and it tasted bad! I tested the milk and it was an expired milk!! They made me feed my daughter bad milk! This is not the only part! In addition they acted like if nothing happened!

They give me full check at the end, including my daughter order and everything. I had to inform them that I am not happy with this behavior they acted like sorry and only took the kids meals off! I was still upset and called for a manager who gave me 20% discount. 

If the restaurant have service concept, they would had either offered me the meal for free and didn't need for me to bag for discount! Offering customers rotten milk is not a minor mistake!!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place out for a while and stopped in for lunch with a friend. We both ordered the cod basket with fries and a side. The size of the fillets were disappointing for $8 plus they were square like they just came out of the frozen section from your local grocery store. I took my first bite and could tell right off the bat they were under cooked, plus they were full of grease. My buddy's were the same way. The fries were okay but left a funny taste in my mouth the rest of the day. Rather than complaining we just ate what was edible out of hunger. The service was good and it's the only reason I rated this place with three stars. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"The only thing I was angry about my experience was I had difficulty parking and did not have a larger appetite to put away more food!!!

The food was great and the atmosphere was fun."}
{"text":"Love this place! We came here for the Fourth of July for my husband's birthday the food was awesome way better than any other seafood we have had in AZ. They had great specials and games for the kids. My daughter won a goldfish playing balloon toss. We had so much fun and enjoyed the food we went back the next day. I got 2lbs of shrimp and was surprised they still had the heads on... freaky. Everything was awesome and the spicy level was explained well. Shout out to Autumn for making the experience even better with great service and entertaining my kids! This place lost a star due to the waiter never showing up after we got our food. Maybe it was a fluke.We will be back and give an updated review."}
{"text":"Seriously Super good food. If you're a sea food/BBQ lover this is the place! Great staff and great ambience plus it's not very pricey. We got the Alaskan crab three sides in the trifecta seasoning sauce, shrimp basket, 2 beers and soda less than $40 of course prices vary. We will def be visiting again."}
{"text":"B×itchy servers.  Horrible and greasy food had a hard time accommodating my two year with food in my opinion I would save your money and time and try some else"}
{"text":"I came in with my family on the last day of the year. Brought my parents that were visiting us from Mexico. We had the most amazing service, experience and time!! We had been here before once and didnt care to write a review because our server 'gigi' seemed super distracted, took time to refill our water cups and  we constantly had to remind her of the things we needed. It was irritating. So we decided to come again and give it a second try. It was 5 of us. Our server Maria was on point with everything! She was friendly, nice and very helpful. You can tell when a server enjoys their job. She was very professional. On top she was very well fluent in Spanish and helped out to explain every single bit of information with my parents! They absolutely loved her. She was able to bring my parents out of their comfort zone with the eating experience. 

We had a bit of everything. Started off with some Cajun Fries, ordered a pound Brisket, absolutely delicious!    We also had beers, the purple haze and the kilt lifter. Ordered some shrimp, snow crab, and mussles. All in the trifecta level 3, which is why I wont give the 5th star review, the trifecta level 3 was super spicy. We have had it before but this time was extremely hot. Good thing they have tons of lemons and limes to help out with the spicy.   We definitely had a huge meal.  We wouldn't of had a wonderful time if Maria wasn't there.  So everytime we go now, we will def be requesting for her. She was on top of everything. So thank you to our server Maria for making our parents feel extremely special and giving us all an amazing welcome. 

Definitely recommend this place, I will be back."}
{"text":"I really like the crab legs and oysters, where they tasted really great. But the price is not so happy people, with an average $ 50 per person.  And the service is not good, I hope they can improve. But for the taste of it I will be back with friends."}
{"text":"stopped in tonight to get food to go on the way home, no one wanted to go out.
have never been here before and wont be back. placed my order, pound of shrimp boil $12, pound of crab boil $15, hush puppies. sat on bench across hostess station, waited and waited and waited. people coming and going having a good time, eating drinking, still waiting. saw about three tables get sat well after I placed my to order getting there food and eating. after about 45min I stood up from the bench and the hostess asked if I was waiting on something and said yes my order, she looked at me and said your order? I said I have been sitting here for 45 min waiting for my to go order watching these people that came 15 and 20 min after I put in my to go order already eating and half way done with there food, blank stare from hostess. with that I left and will not return."}
{"text":"We are from the East Coast and have been living in AZ for 6 years. We have finally found the seafood place. First of all, two people we know told us how amazing this place was. They were so right!  Everything about this place was amazing, the drinks, the service and most importantly the food. I got the snow crab with all in the three sauces and hot spices. It was amazing. My hubby got the shrimp also excellent. Our appetizer was fried clams and they were so reminiscent of back east. You have to go here!! Best seafood in Az. Oh and the prices are great!!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a Saturday and the food and service were both great! We had the  raw oysters, Dungeness Crab and pulled pork. The food was excellent. The oysters were some of the best we have had in the valley. Very fresh! My only complaint about my meal was that the crab was not cleaned. I guess it is the nature of this type of dining experience, but having to clean the crab at the table is gross and a bit unappetizing. I got over it and enjoyed the meal, but think that this could be an issue for others, especially if one is not familiar with the  crab cleaning process and what to do. Luckily, I have been eating (and cleaning) Dungeness crabs since I was a child so it was kind of a non issue for us but defiantly worth mentioning. 
The service was great! Our server, Jacob was awesome. He was attentive, funny, and he took time to explain the menu as it was our first time. Give this man a raise! :)
A welcome addition to the neighborhood!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"As a first timer going to this restaurant - I really do want to rate them a 5 out of 5 restaurant. The food and staff were tops! One of our waitresses was Frankie - she was so enthused about the food and the restaurant - and with reason, as all of our party of 7 thoroughly enjoyed this food and the restaurant.  They all know how to make you feel welcome. I would recommend them to everyone - and the meal costs are very reasonable. Take the time to enjoy this place - yummy!"}
{"text":"First time visit on a Sunday afternoon.  Walked right in and was immediately seated.  The place was pretty full so that was a pleasant surprise.  Server was prompt and very helpful.   He asked if it was our first time and then walked us through the menu.  Wife got crayfish and sausage with trifecta seasoning and 1 heat the kid got clams with traditional boil and 0 heat.  I got mussels wiith corn and king crab with trifecta and 1 heat.  Everything was great.  The wife's crayfish she said were amazing.  I have to take her word for it as I don't care for crawfish.  The kids clams were very tasty and seemed hotter at 0 heat than our 1.  We chalked it up to different seasonings.  My mussels and king crab were the bomb.  We also shared an order of Cajun fries and they were also great.

Complaints - wife ordered sausage but didn't get it but it wasn't on the bill either.  My mussels had a lot of broken shells almost as if it had been dropped.  I assume this isn't the norm so no harm no foul.

So all in all a very great experience. Big thank you to our server.  He was very helpful, attentive and made sure that we were taken care of.  Steve even got out daughter a marker and gave her advice on where to write her name on the wall.  We will absolutely be returning,  especially when my wife needs her crawfish fix."}
{"text":"We have ate at the Angry Crab a few times now and will continue to go back. Most of our meals have been great and since it's hard to find good seafood in AZ this place is one of the better options. Make sure to order the trifecta - it's addicting!  Service and food quality is better during the week when it's less busy so come early."}
{"text":"Great seafood.  I was not expecting good seafood in the middle of the valley, but this place does not disappoint.  The prices a not bad either. FYI It is a known place, so wait times can get long."}
{"text":"First visit to Angry Crab Shack.  Very busy on a Tuesday night. Our server was Shelby and she was awesome!!!  We had the King crab legs - gigantic and very meaty!!, and shrimp - also very large!  We did trifecta (Shelby's suggestion) with spice level 1 and it was excellent. Dad tried the cod basket and says its by far the best he has had. It happened to be my birthday so I received a free dessert, opted for the root beer float. VERY good. 
This is an establishment with a very low key and relaxed atmosphere. Your eating out of a plastic bag with your hands!!!  Go and embrace \" the boil\"!!!!"}
{"text":"Comedy of Errors/Horrors!
The only reason they are getting one star is because the food was actually very good.  The service on the other hand was atrocious!   We knew it was going to be busy so we were not in a hurry and we did not expect to be seated in a timely manner.  Seriously, we went there with a very open mind.  

The food comes out as it is ready and the whole table is not served together.  Normally, okay I get it, but this was over-the-top.  It is very hard to eat together when the food can come out in 20 minutes or 30 minutes.  They brought us bibs plenty of time before the meals came out, but they did not offer to bring gloves (many diners were wearing them) and they did not offer to bring any silverware (or should I say plasticware)!  The food is brought out by \"runners\" not the waitress, so they just holler out what they have, such as Shrimp, trifecta 2.  Four people at our table ordered King Crab so it was a little confusing when the runner just yells out the order.  They do not know who ordered it, just the table number.   My husband's food came out but was inadvertently given to another person at our table.  (They ordered the same dinner, but had different add-ons in the bag).  When another King crab dinner came out, they realized he actually had my husband's dinner and took the new dinner, but it wasn't the right dinner either and it had to go back.  

Two people at the table had received their dinner when my dinner came out.  At that time my husband and I asked for gloves and silverware.  I also asked the waitress for some melted butter, which by the way costs .50 when you spend $25.00 for your entree.  She said, \"I will put the order in.\"    In the meantime my food and my husband's food is getting cold, we are waiting for gloves and silverware.  It took at least 5 minutes to get our gloves.  It took an additional 5 minutes to get silverware, which was actually plastic.  At about 15 minutes the butter arrives, but the runner doesn't realize who ordered it and one of the gentleman at the end of the table where she brought it thought she was just bringing it out to anyone, so he inadvertently took it for his dinner which was yet to be served.    Trying to flag down the waitress at this point was a daunting task.  Of course she is nowhere to be found.  Finally I track her down and explain the situation about the butter. I don't want the gentleman to feel bad about taking my butter, so I ask her to just try  to bring it out as quickly as possible.   She said, \"I will put another order in.\"  Are you crazy!!!!!   You can't just go to the kitchen and scoop it into a little plastic cup yourself!!!  Everyone is about done eating when I finally get the butter.  This is about 20 minutes after my bag of food came.    In the meantime the gentleman that was waiting for his order did receive the correct bag of food, but the runners proceeded to bring at least three more bags of food to our table to give to him, which we of course refused.

Okay, you want the topping on the cake?  We were here to celebrate my sister's birthday, it was her choice to come here.  Anyway, she had mentioned to the waitress the reason for our visit.   The waitress brought her a piece of cake, very nice.  But the only problem was that they sang Happy Birthday to the wrong table about five minutes before she brought the cake!

We had 7 people in our party, not huge by any means, they split the check into couples, but they added 18% gratuity onto each bill anyway.  Luckily we noticed it before we doubled her tip.    Before we left she asked \"Are you going to come back?\"  She was met with an uncomfortable silence at the table.  

The food was good, but really the waitress can't bring gloves, plasticware and butter in a timely manner after your food has arrived?  Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"CELIAC FRIENDLY!!!
Whoohoo another place to eat that gets it right.
Food was really good servers Barb and Holly went out of there way to ensure a safe and comfortable dining experience for our entire table."}
{"text":"My girlfriends & I went there for the start of a girls nite out.  The aroma from the parking lot was intoxicating.  We grabbed some drinks from the bar & were seated quicker than expected.  We ordered some of everything and put it right in the middle of our table.  The King Crab & Snow Crab were unbeatable.  The oysters were fresh as can be.  The staff was energetic and fun.  The only thing I didn't get to try was the legs from a spicy creature they called Hungzilla.  Those looked awesome.
     We will be coming back for sure.  The food can't be beaten and the staff was great.  Just plan on getting juice and suace all over everything."}
{"text":"First time eating here. The atmosphere was loud but in a good way. I had the shrimp and my wife had the crab with the sausage and corn on the cob.  Both were very good.   Shelby our serever was excellent.   Ask for her."}
{"text":"I went with a party of 13 to celebrate a birthday. Everyone really enjoyed their food. I ordered snow crab with Trifecta sauce and got the wimpy flavor. This had a little kick to it still, but I would not want it spicier. I normally like spicy food, but I wanted to taste the crab legs so this was perfect. I also had calamari to start, which everyone loved. I wanted to try their BBQ so I took some brisket home, which was also great. One of the sides I got with that was cornbread. I normally don't care for cornbread at all, but I couldn't believe how good it was. Most of the cornbread I have tried has been dry and bland. This was moist and delicious! I also want to add that the mixed drinks we all ordered were nice and strong(how we like them). We all can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"A little expensive, but totally worth it. My fiancé and I came here for a date night and we were provided with great service, excellent food, and a fun environment."}
{"text":"Great food and a fun atmosphere! The shrimp was my favorite along with the Cajun fries. Prepare to eat with your hands and get a little messy. The wait staff seemed a little confused about the menu but we ate there when it first opened so they may have been adjusting. On the plus side they were very friendly and polite."}
{"text":"Love this place so much!!!! We ordered two pounds of shrimp, sausage, potato, corn and wings. Everything tastes sooo delicious!!! We just kept munching so didn't  have a chance to take  photos! 
It's  better than hot n juicy and even better than boiling crab!
Can't  wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"We kept hearing about this place at random, people talking in the grocery store, IG etc. so we looked it up to satisfy a craving for some good ol' healthful fried food. 

We got the fried clams and hush puppies to go. They were heavenly. Good batter on the clams with great spice and the hush puppies had a great balance of spice and fried goodness. 

While in the restaurant, the staff were great and the atmosphere and layout seemed very comfortable. 

We will be back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"I wanted this to be good, but it was a half and half.  The fried oysters were excellent.  The fried clams were not!  They were so over fried, dark, dark, breading, and so tough.  We asked for tarter sauce and got cocktail instead.  The clams came out first, then 5 minutes later the server noticed the oyster had not been served.  She went to get them.  We both ordered a side of coleslaw.  Shame on management.   For $2.00 they should serve some slaw.  I had about two table spoons of slaw, my friend had one.  It should be a least 2-3 oz or so.  Slaw is not expensive.  What I had was really good too. I really dislike the music being so loud too.  It was hard to talk over it and was not fun.   We decided probably wont' be back again."}
{"text":"Well... Came out with a giant smile. First timer and definitely coming back. Beware you might not want to bring your nicest clothes, it will get messy. 

To order you pick the seafood you want and order by the pound, then pick your sauce and how spicy you want it. I threw in sausage and corn for a small fee. 

We ordered snow crab, clams, mussels, and shrimp. And they all tasted fresh and very yummy. We also ordered rice and fries. The fries are very very good as well.

If you're not into seafood they have bbq also, but I have yet to try it. The table next to us ordered bbq and it looked great!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Goodyear location three times. I give it only three stars because of the seating configuration and ambiance. This restaurant originally was a JB's and the footprint has not changed, just more tables crowded in. I would hope they add a huge deck on the West side of the building for outside seating.  It was small and tight before and seriously worse now. That and the high level of noise make for a jarring evening of dining. The food is what one would expect but the shrimp has always been overcooked and rubbery. The crab is sweet and delicious. The vegetables are tasty and worth the cost. The sausage is mundane and not worth the expense in my opinion. Honestly, if you want a quiet evening this is not the place to be. If you want seafood this is the best place to get it in the West Valley."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Food and service were wonderful!!  We ended up sitting at the bar because there was an hour wait.  Very glad we stayed."}
{"text":"Granted, we did not order what they are known for.  We ordered the ribs and a po-boy sandwich with oysters and shrimp. The ribs were smothered with liquid smoke (the ribs were one consistent color and it took at least 10 hand washings to get the smoke smell off of my fingers) the BBQ sauce was spicy and quite good.  The po-boy's bread was dry and tasted a couple of days old (we were there on Sunday night). Our waitress was not very good either, she forgot our appetizers and messed up our drink order.  Overall, very disappointing and I would not return."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. However, our service Candice had a very condescending attitude which made the meal very awkward. The siren is also OBNOXIOUS, MY GOD."}
{"text":"I ate there with my family yesterday night, it was our first time and we will be back !! It was awesome to eat with our hands ! We took some shrimps,  mussels and snow crabs! We choose mild and medium and it was really spicy! Our waitress was kind of slow but really nice ! We had a great time and some great pictures!"}
{"text":"Ate a late lunch here. Just happened to find it on Yelp and gave it a try. We decided to try the boils this time. We had mussels and shrimp with the traditional sauce and a separate dozen shrimp with the 'trifecta'. Definitely go withe the trifecta. I also added corn and sausage which were both good. We tried the hush puppies and they were nicely prepared and flavorful with a little kick. Also tried the slaw-- decent, not bad but not exceptional.
Service was all good.

Next time I think we will try some of the fried stuff and a Po boy."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. I'm in heaven. This place has THE best atmosphere. Before the food hits your palate, you will notice the laid back, relaxed environment. Our waitress Alexa rocked!!!! So cool!!!! She even offered to help crack our crab! Talk about service. My husband and I ate to our hearts content. The snow crab was great quality and the shrimp had a great flavor. Do NOT forget to order the char oysters, no joke.... I died and went to heaven as soon as I took a bite. Even if you don't like oysters, TRY THEM! Best sauce, fresh seafood! We wish we were local! We would be back every weekend!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible!
Fried food seems 'old' - batter much too thick and dry, 1 fresh crab for 40$ and was not cleaned.  We were told all parts are edible - not true.  Do you want to eat the 'tamales'?
Will never go back."}
{"text":"Been going here since the day it opened. Trifecta 1 with crab or shrimp is so good, add a corn and get a side of rice or Cajun fries to make it even better. The fried catfish is also really good."}
{"text":"I was invited out to this place a few weeks ago with my friends who raved about this place. After a super enjoyable evening and bomb seafood, I was convinced that this place would be the seafood contender for AZ, compared to San Diego!! Our server was on point, the food came out as desired and I was so excited about the next time I could visit!!

Until today.. My fiance and I randomly went around 2pm today and there was hardly anyone there!! Got seated quickly by the host, and was asked about drinks and if we knew the run down of the menu. We said yes and the server left. After a few, I was asking about the 'fresh squeezed ipa', she didnt seem to have much knowledge about it and never offered a sample. So I just ordered it anyways. We ordered our food ( Brisket sandwich w fries and #1 of King crab legs with a potato, trifeta #1) and was given water and a set of tools to crack the legs. The server was surprised that I brought my own as the last time, they didnt have enough for the whole restaraunt the last time..(??) So my fiance gets his sandwich like super quick and the runner runs off and its not his order. He tries to stop her and he ends up going to the bar to explain to her that this is the wrong order and why are we getting it before my boil? Next thing that shows up is my crab legs and THEN!! I get my IPA... I respectfully wait for my fiance's food to arrive and its cold... Super fatty (I like fat), coleslaw on the sammich when he asked for it on the side and there's no utensils to eat coleslaw... By this time, I have been trying to get our server's attention for 'melted butter' as I battle my crab legs. By the time I get it, we have not been asked how our food was, if we needed anything or to refill our waters. This was not butter.. it resembled the kind you put on popcorn. My $28.50 crab legs are swimming in oil and they have no taste. I pull off my bib and wait for her to come around.. 10 minutes go by and her 2 tables left, still no inquirey about our food. As she's cleaning the 2 tables around us, I stand up and ask her for a manager. The manager never introduces himself and almost walks by us. We tell him whats wrong, like our food coming out at seperate times, no utnesils to eat coleslaw, potato etc. and he seemed surprised but decides to comp our meal. My fiance and I have worked as servers in various places and realize that not everyone will have the training or knowledge but this was ridiculous!! 
Every aspect of this place (during the day) was pretty damb sad for the price and servers who were standing around talking with each other and ignoring their tables!! Also after we talked to the no name manager, the booth next to us had a huge spill and there was no one around even caring about it.  
It really sucks because I was so impressed the first time that I didnt mind laying down some serious cash for this place.
Lesson learned.. This place needs some serious training if they want repeat customers.."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS. Where else can you get authentic low country boil in AZ? Fun atmosphere to catch a game and awesome SPICY food."}
{"text":"I have to give our server Sean five stars. Great personality and service!
We both had a shrimp bag, mine was with Trifecta and #2 for heat and my wife had lemon butter and garlic. We both had potatoes and shared some sausage.
Both meals were just ok. Pretty rubbery shrimp that lost most of the flavor once you peeled it. Kind of disappointed. The potato was good and the sausage was ok. 
Pretty busy though so maybe it was just me this time. We will try it again probably."}
{"text":"Snow crab legs were good, first time here. Did anyone else get sick from eating here on Monday 2-8-16. I had A TERRIBLE stomach ache after followed by vomiting and diarrhea several hours after eating. I had the mild trifecta seasoning."}
{"text":"Some friends introduced me to this restaurant.  It's good!  You wear a bib and make a mess.  Probably not the best place for a first date (or second for that matter).  But overall, good service and good food."}
{"text":"Love this place. The atmosphere is great. Love the food. Giving it three stars because the spiciness of the sauces are inconsistent. We ordered a level two and it was too spicy even though it's what we normally order. The couple next to us sent their food back for the same reason. We threw away the sausage, potatoes and corn because it was too spicy. On another occasion ordered a level two and it was not spicy at all. The service is OK- sometimes the wait staff gets busy and drinks don't get refilled for a while. Would recommend to other people but would make them aware."}
{"text":"When I am jonesing for some seafood I come here and I am never disappointed. Long long waits. But the Moscow mule,a bag of seafood, and some corn can't be bad. Flavors are great! Try the trifecta. It's the best one. Love this spot!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place. 5 star prices with 1 star service. A $40 lobster is served in a bag with no plate, plastic silverware and a rock to break the shell. The food is eaten off of a paper table cloth and paper cups. The taste of the food was good but everything else was just awkward and off putting, not to mention the loud screams for spicy food and birthdays.. I could certainly do with out all that nonsense."}
{"text":"I followed La Donna to every bar/restaurant she worked and she has always been the best. Great service La Donna and my food was great as well! Best king crab, yummies as she describes it! So satisfied!!"}
{"text":"So I heard a lot about this place figured give it a try. It's ok. Chill atmosphere. I had the bartender as my server. Real nice & informative but this isn't a destination place for me. Not a huge fan of doing all the work for seafood. I prefer it prepped & ready to eat. If I had to choose between this & Joe's Crab shack I'd go there. There just isn't one close to me. I may or may not go back here. Probably just buy the food & cook at home."}
{"text":"Best. Crab. Legs. Ever. Well, at least for Az! Highly recommend the Trifecta seasoning! Perfect blend of spice and tang. Also had the Cajun fries, and the car'd oysters are to die for! Ask for Will! He made the dining experience that much better!!! Come here if u want crab meat!! Affordable, fun, and mouth watering!!!"}
{"text":"Ever had your mind blown at dinner? 

If not, go here and change your life. 

P.S. best bloody Mary's this side of the Mississipp."}
{"text":"I love this place. I haven't found any other place yet that has this atmosphere and good food. I stop by every time I pass through town if I can. If you don't have a huge appetite you can split a pound with added sausage and potatoes and it's perfect. If you're like me and like to eat, hog it all for yourself. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Our waiter Glenn was amazing! Super patient with us as it was our first time! Our 3rd person was very late. But he was still so amazing with us even though we took up a table for a very long time. I don't do yelp but wanted to let everyone know. His service was amazing! And I know this because I used to wait tables. And wanted everyone to know if you go there and get Glenn you will be more than satisfied. Awesome waiter! And will go far! Good job Glenn wish the best for you and your family!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere.  Service was top notch. It is definitely a new favorite we will be back for sure. The crawfish is excellent and the crab legs were some of the best I've had"}
{"text":"Their Monday mix bag is off the hook! And when they say spicy they mean it!! I have been to both locations and they are both on point!"}
{"text":"Best seafood in town!! Nothing fancy but if you like crab or shrimp or oysters or about anything else from the sea, you need to try this place!!"}
{"text":"Good food,  fun atmosphere and staff.  Just a couple of minor hiccups. They had to search the restaurant for shell crackers for my table,  without which I could not eat the king crab I ordered. Also as they got busier we stopped getting drink refills. All in all though,  it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Complaints were addressed. Manager, Vanessa, was great & reconciled everything. Will definitely return. Thank you once again."}
{"text":"Complete waste of time, half the menu was sold out but didn't bother to tell us till after we waited over an hour. Finally when our food did come some of it was cold and had a strong fishy odor! Spoiled! Sent it back and left! WILL NEVER COME BACK!

Outrageous prices for low quality."}
{"text":"I always end up at angry crab some how! My friends tried hot n juicy today, and said it was \"just alright\" compared to angry crab. And right now it's more expensive than angry crab too, so why go somewhere more expensive for \"just alright\" when you can get better for cheaper?! Plus angry crab uses currrry nowww!~ I wonder if hot n juicy does too, can someone let me know? Thank you for readinggg! ^-^v"}
{"text":"Wow!  Great food and prices.   Messy!   Good flavor,  good service and did I mention messy?   Glad we tried it.   We will be back"}
{"text":"Wow... and WOW. That's all that I can say. Our friends took us to eat here and we liked it so much that we came back two days later to have more! We each ordered crab with different sauces/sides. Mine was garlic with mild sauce, corn and sausage for sides. The crab was easy to get into and by far, some of the best that I have ever tasted. Everyone donned the crab bibs and barely spoke as we tore through our meals. 

This place, by far, is one of the best places that I have been to in a long time. Excellent service, excellent food. 

I can't get enough!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with food. Not going again. Oysters and snow crab was ok. However, hush puppies, fried soft shell crab dish were horrible. Overall, not coming again."}
{"text":"Loved it!!  Our server was excellent explaining to us the menu and the \"how to\"  when it came to ordering and the Crab legs are a must.. Because they give you a rock to smash em open with and the hubby had a ball acting like a cave man!!  Great times!!"}
{"text":"I am from the coast of South Carolina, so I have high expectations of coastal fare... Angry Crab did NOT disappoint. I had the snow crab legs and mussels with trifecta sauce... and they were sooooo fresh and delicious. Also had the corn on the cob and fries, which were zesty and yummy, too. Our server was super enthusiastic - hilariously so - about describing the menu offerings and how it all works. Apparently, they fly in Alaskan seafood every day! Well, I could tell. I can't wait to go back. I'm pacing myself so I don't become addicted. Lol."}
{"text":"Pretty yummy crawfish. A little expensive for what they give you. Service is usually pretty good.


The French fries are awesome.


I really enjoy the paper on the table. Cause if you have kids they can draw.

The clams are also delicious. Haven't tried a whole lot from here. 

Service is really good when I have been here. 

They're usually out of a lot of things. 
Every time I have been here they have been out of atleast one menu item. 
One time I called right when they were opening and they were literally out of all crawfish and clams. Which is crazy. She had no idea when the next shipment would be in. 


So anyways we will probably be back. 
But for the price and the chance they will be out of stuff I may as well cook at home."}
{"text":"Last night was our first visit to the Angry Crab Shack.  The food was delicious, the prices reasonable for a seafood restaurant, and service was amazingly good.  It isn't the typical seafood restaurant, as it is very casual, butcher paper for table cloths (with good reason!), very good menu.  The waitresses and waiters were all extremely attentive and accommodating. We will definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"This place is the premier seafood restaurant for the Phoenix area in my opinion. The location is somewhat far in comparison the where I'm at in Buckeye, but worth the drive. A lot of food for the price and a taste that's oh so good, this place will keep you coming back for more."}
{"text":"I had a really fun experience! It was great for a medium to large group and there was a lot of laughter to be had. Yes!  It was super messy but that's the experience for you. The food was flavorful and I have full intentions of returning. Like so many others, I had a pound of shrimp with the trifecta seasoning...and  it was wonderful. I did go a little too spicy with it and next time will go with a one instead of two"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere!  Really enjoyed the staff... Jeff and Mike at the bar were fantastic!! Ordered the lobster boil special and a pound of the king crab.  The lobster boil was full of mussels, shrimp, and veggies... Delicious!!! The king crab legs were ordered in a traditional boil, highly recommend this... It was the perfect amount of spice!  The favors were so good we didn't even need to order butter to dip our seafood in!  Come to this place with an open mind, eat with your hands, and enjoy!  Great addition to the Ahwatukee area!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic concept, well executed. Fun place where food is great and well priced. I've been there 3 times, and it is always packed. It's fun, messy, low key, yummy. Will go back next week, and the week after, and the week after... Dan, Ralph... You guys rock."}
{"text":"I'm rating this place one star because I ordered a pound of shrimp and it came out super watery also a catfish basket and it wasn't cooked all the way this is my second time hear and last. Waitress was really nice that's the only reason why I gave a one star"}
{"text":"We were at the Angry Crab and had the most excellent food and service! In our group there were eight of us we ordered everything from bbq to soft shell crab, which I had the soft shell and it was as good as in New Orleans and the whole group had nothing but great things to say!"}
{"text":"I have yet to see another restaurant as unique as this one.  Amazing seafood with a pirate ship vibe. It's a fun place to go to with a group of people on a Friday or Saturday night. Definitely 5 stars."}
{"text":"Food and services was beyond my expectations. The servers are very nice and super friendly. The food came out hot. The catfish was cooked just like momma use to make for family gatherings. The brought back childhood memories of good down home southern fish fry parties. Will be back for sure.....thank you Angry Crab crew you all are wonderful people."}
{"text":"Omg we really love this place ! We are from Texas and a stop at any of their locations is always a must when in Arizona ! Plus mix bag Monday's is a great deal !"}
{"text":"Had the trifecta sauce with shrimp.  Was awesome.  Yeah, it's messy, wear short sleeves and don't wear fancy clothes.  It's messy but great!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I had dinner here last night. We had shrimp, clams, chicken, potatoes and coleslaw. We chose the sweet and tangy sauce. The sauce was exactly that. Every thing was fresh, made to order. The crowd was diverse. Wait staff attentive. It was affordable as well."}
{"text":"Love this location. Plenty of seating, great energy and amazing food. Prices are great"}
{"text":"Wow...DELICIOUS!  Had no idea what to expect.  Crab legs were cooked to perfection and the sauce....we actually ordered some bread to sop up the sauce after we were done with the crab.  They even gave me a fabulous white chocolate raspberry cheesecake for dessert for my birthday!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very good seafood for Phoenix.  If you do order 5 star spice in the bag, you are either going to have a very bad time, or you enjoy riding that capsaicin high.  Friendly staff, fast service, clean, fun atmosphere.  I hope this place succeeds."}
{"text":"Great food and service is never a disappointment.  Kat always provides exceptional service with a smile!!!! She had us try the charred oysters and they were AMAZING...THANKS KAT !!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with friends and family. it was our 1st time trying The Angry Crab Shack. The smell of the food hits you when you walk through the doors was heavenly. The restaurant was very busy but on a Monday night but our service was great! We started out with fried clams and gumbo. Best fried clams I've ever had! Gumbo was mighty tasty. We ordered the treasure bag, trifecta medium. Perfect flavor, not to hot at all. The bag contained shrimp, crab legs,  dungeness crab and mixed vegetables. My husband also added the sausage to his treasure bad. We shared from crawfish with our table of  6 and they were huge. It's a little pricey but in the end it was WAY worth it. We left completely stuffed and satisfied! We will definitely be visiting this restaurant again to try out all the other delicious food!!!"}
{"text":"Forgiveness is my virtue and by all means it does help when mgmt recognizes patient patronage. We were sent home wih a complimentary order of the special NOLA grilled oysters. Good job and no longer angry :)"}
{"text":"I've been here for a few times since this place been opened. My sister was craving for crawfish so we decided to come back tonight. We ordered the sweet potato fries and it came out really soggy, oily and burn. We also ordered shrimp, clam and crawfish. The juice doesn't taste like before which really disappointed me. I rather drive far to go to Hot and Juicy to get better food."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try a new seafood place. We were tired of the bland boring Red lobster and Joes Crab Shack. Well, we have now found our new place and won't be wasting our time and money at any other seafood place. We loved the whole experience. Our server was fantastic with his recommendations. You could tell he believed the food he was suggesting was the best and he loved what he did. The meal was messy but it made the experience that much more memorable. Make sure to add the potato and sausage to your bag. You won't regret it!  I hope they open one in Ahwatukee!"}
{"text":"The place was an awesome  experience  over all, I tried the shrimp in the bag, I did not care for the shrimp because the meat tasted sweet. The hush puppies  on the other hand were great and the corn bread was good as well, if you like it sweet."}
{"text":"Food 10/10
Price 9/10
Staff 8/10 

We've been to this crab twice and ready to go back for the third time. The only reason this review isn't 5 star is because of one specific hostess that killed our mood. The food is outstanding for the price. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I went in not expecting much out of a seafood restaurant in the middle of the desert, I walked out a fan!  The snow crab was delicious, but my favorite part of the night was my server, Ben.  He was attentive to our needs the entire time.  He was so sweet and patient with my grandmother.  It really made her night and ours. We will have to request him every time we go back!"}
{"text":"Looks fun inside but holy shit was my meal sorry! Had the grilled salmon with rice, first off it's not dirty rice its clumpy tasteless white rice That was covered in black pan scrapings.the salmon was a tiny piece of shit poorly grilled specimen, that cost me $15 bucks, Plus they forgot to put my order in so I had to wait while my friend ate his meal. Then they offered me a piece of corn bread for their mistake, then they forgot my side order on top of all of this. And there coleslaw is shit to boot! My buddies fried catfish sucked too. The breading was as salty as a fat woman's armpit. If I could score this dump any lower I would but they don't have a negative star button! PASS ON THIS TALL Glass OF POOP JUICE!"}
{"text":"To be brief: my wife, brothers, sisters, family and friends will NOT be coming back to this little shop of seafood horror. What happend? You are asking. Maybe he's new to this? I am not. I've eaten at many seafood and cajun places. I will keep this brief as i can. i need to literally throw up my disappointing meal. We were there around 730 tonight. To start the waitress messed up some of our orders. When she tried to explain the correction it was done so in a confusing manner. When we asked about a clarifocation or when we repeated what we heard he say it was met with an attitude. Fast forward to the meal. I ordered the shrimp and a lobster. The shrimp was old and grainy/mushy. The meat was not as plump as it should have been. The shell was difficult to remove from some of the shrimp. NOW the effing HORROR. The Lobster. When I cracked into the first claw I was greeted with a little over 1/4 of a cup of juicesnpourong out of the claw. The meat in the claw is suppose to be plump. This was not. This one looked like an eldery persons wrinkly-I-use-to-be-over-weight-hand but in a lobster claw form. The second was no better. Next I decided to take the tail off to see if it can salvage the dismal meal. WHY THE HELL DID I TAKE THE TAIL OFF?!! The horror that was waiting for me came OOZING out. Confirmed by my horrified and disgusted family... the tail was still VERY RAW and had a fair amount of feces in the tail, AND the meat was old. The colors (and don't read this if you are squeamish) were black, mucus green, and brown surrounded  by translucent/slightly opaque withered meat. And I mean this... plenty Slime. I put everything down. And kept as quiet and calm as I could. I reached for the first person I saw, tall large guy short brown hair. I showed and told him about the lobster. He quickly took it away. They offered to cook me a new one. I declined. I didn't touch anything else not even my drink as I began to grow very nauseous sick and warm. I really needed that drink though. I dry heaved a few times by the car. Got home. Threw up what I could. Now fighting to write this review in hopes to save anyone else from this. I hope I can make it to work tomorrow, with few \"interruptions\" and hopefully make it for thanksgiving. Once again... wife, brothers, sisters, family will not return. I will share our experience with our friends and extended family."}
{"text":"My first time there wasn't anything special. I had a Po'Boy, and I've had better. I'd like to go back eventually for the crab, but I'm in no rush."}
{"text":"I cant believe I didn't know this place existed. The best seafood place I've been too (and I use to work at Red Lobster ;)) 

The place is fun with great decor. It smells amazing. And the food is awesome! They had a great assortment of seafood that was spot on the description. We ordered crab legs and shrimp and loved it. The staff was so friendly and knowledgeable! This would be a great place for a party or family get together. 

We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I love this place. We would have to say Matthew is the best server we have ever had.
He is one of the main reasons we go there. 
We have had lunches, dinners and birthday parties there and always have an incredible time and meal.  I love the King Crab it is AMAZING.  Ask for Matthew you won't be disappointed he is a blast."}
{"text":"I scheduled a meet up here and what a disaster. Some of the food came out after some were already finished eating. It really shouldn't take that long for a couple of po boys. When one of those did make it to the table it was burned. The wings were sent back for being over fried. After getting up to speak to the manager multiple times regarding the  orders he finally came over to the table and was very rude. Needless to say none of us will ever return.  I am sorry I scheduled the meetup at this place. Now I know why it's ANGRY!"}
{"text":"This place gets 4 stars for fresh seafood in the desert. I ordered a pound of crawfish in the trifecta sauce on a number1 level of spicy. Having read reviews, I knew this would be plenty spicy (and I like spicy food). My friends that are bigger wusses wished they ordered a 0. The seasoning is very flavorful, unfortunately my plastic bag (how the food is brought out to you) had a leak, so be careful about the red sauce getting on your lap. A plastic bib only covers so much. I was fortunate because these crawfish were alive right before I ordered them and came out looking/tasting great. I also added some sausage to my bag (it's one kielbasa-style sausage cut into 4 pieces) which was also flavorful and made it just the right amount of food for me. Sides ordered included the sweet potato fries-ok; cajun fries-ok; and bread for my friends needing some spicy food killer. We were fortunate to not have a big wait and the food came out relatively quick. My biggest complaint would be that we needed paper towels vs the napkins provided on the table. There are a couple of wash basins to fight for when it is time to get cleaned up. Also, the table clothes are paper. Before we were all done, a bus boy came to roll up/take away half of the stuff still there on the table. Normally when I'm done eating I really don't want to look at the carcasses of what I devoured; however, on this occasion some stuff was cleared that we were not done with. Overall a good experience and I expect to return to try something different."}
{"text":"My first time trying crab legs, and I am glad we chose this place. The service is awesome the food  was just great, I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here on their grand opening day and both had the king crab with the mild trifecta sauce, which was delicious! Our waiter, Mitch, was very helpful and friendly.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try The Angry Crab and then so I ended up SO disappointed. :(.  The service is poor, food expensive and the restaurant is not clean. The best part of our anniversary meal was the expensive beer. So glad we dropped $90 on a meal eating out of plastic bags with our fingers. I could smell the stink on my fingers for 2 days. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"We really likes the angry crab. Service was great and the food as well. I had shrimp p.o.'boy with hush puppies and he had po'boy with buffalo chicken and onion rings. We got a bag of shrimp to go. We will defiantly be back there."}
{"text":"I have been here with both my friends and family. Every time my girlfriend wants to go out this is where I suggest to go. The food it great! The atmosphere is fun, and the people there are also pretty cool."}
{"text":"I don't eat out often, I'm normally too much of a quiet individual to want to head out, but a good friend of mine suggested this place. She explained the hustle and bustle type of atmosphere as well as the boil bag they offer here and I told myself why not. Try something new. So I arrived, greeted by a lovely young lady named Isabella, I think that was her name and was seated at a comfortable booth. A server arrived quite quickly, a pleasant surprise compared to other restaurants. Explained the entire menu, suggested a few drinks and appetizers and raced off to fulfill my order. She came back with a smile on her face and I actually smiled back, (very unlike me!) She was very friendly like the rest of the staff. I order a pound of snow crab which I have never tried before with a sauce who's name I don't remember. It had a few sauce flavors in it I believe. The server took my menu and told me I get a bib and tools! I was astounded at how well I felt taken care, but even these things paled to the fact she helped open my food and showed me how to do it myself! All with a smile on her face, there was a busser boy there that helped clean while I ate, Matt? Mathew? Something along those lines. He greeted me and got back to work with some hustle in his step. I finally finished my food and they took care of my table before dropping off the check. It was perfect. Literally the only restaurant I've ever felt like family in, and I really had to stop and thank everyone who helped me. They were perfect. GO HERE! I'm sure you'll love it like i did. Oh! The server was Valerie! She's amazing. Thanks so much everyone."}
{"text":"Reminded us of the Crab Cooker in Newport. Food was great. The garlic crab legs and shrimp rocked!"}
{"text":"Got in before the dinner rush. Excellent service and great food. Giving up on Joes Crab Shack and Red Lobster. Better prices and service."}
{"text":"I love seafood but I do not appreciate this restaurant's method of cooking or messy serving. Eating out of a paper bag without utensils or plates and the greasy saucing is not worth a return visit."}
{"text":"My 1st experience with this place and I most likely will not return. We called in an order for lunch and when my co-worker went to pick it up the order was messed up. I ordered the catfish basket with a side of mac n cheese.  I got 2 sides of mac n cheese and no fries. My co-worker who had also ordered a side of mac n cheese was told they ran out but she could substitute. So she got the corn bread which they charged her extra for!  Then she gets to the car and there is no cornbread,  that they just charged her for,  and she had to go back in again. And the mac n cheese that we had such an ordeal with was the nastiest mac n cheese I've ever had.  Not sure if it was because it was a holiday and who ever was working just didn't care to make any type of effort that day or what, but this is a HORRIBLE  1st impression."}
{"text":"All I can say is --- YUMMY!!! Great food, great service. Great atmosphere. Great decor. And unique in an awesome way! If your in Scottsdale and craving seafood or ribs or pulled pork or corn or Mac don't miss it!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my husband & a friend and just let me start off by saying GEO was ABSOLUTELY AN AMAZING server!!! GREAT! GREAT! GREAT! Because of him we will definitely be coming back!!! Very personable! There's not enough time in the day to rave about Geo! You guys did great by hiring him onto your team!!! Oh yeah and the food was good too!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good except those are not Cajun sausage (Andoullie), more like smoked. Not enough season so I had to ask for a side of their Cajun season. The fried oysters were very good I must say. I will return for more when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"So incredibly delicious. I had the snow crab with the trifecta sauce with potatoes and corn, it was served in a boil bag and dear lord, I'll be dreaming of it for weeks. 

Service was fabulous, food was to die for. Seriously, put on a bib, pack your wet-naps, grab everyone you like and treat yo self."}
{"text":"Service slow. Food good but expensive and very messy. Recommend the snow crab legs with lemon pepper 0 level spice. Dungeness crab is expensive and not much meat there."}
{"text":"Our family had a ball here! Food and atmosphere were both wonderful and the service was excellent! Definitely worth the long wait and we will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is high energy. We went last night and the server was awesome. She took the time to sit down and go over the menu once she learned it was our first visit. Our servers name was Michelle and she was very attentive. The food was excellent. We ordered 2lbs of king crab with all three seasonings..medium heat. YUM."}
{"text":"The staff and good are very good! It seems to be very busy very time we go but we like the customer service and food so its worth going. One thing is the restrooms need to be taken care of and maybe even fixed up! But worth going hope to see the restrooms fixed up."}
{"text":"This is a awesome place with low prices for seafood and the severs are awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"This was very disappointing! I ordered the frog legs and they were terrible! They do not season them at all..the fries were not fresh. My son got chicken tenders that were hard as rocks! I'm so mad that I wasted my money at this place. Please save your money!"}
{"text":"My young son chose this place after YouTube-ing a bunch of grown men eating crab off the grill in Australia.  The next video was a patron eating at Angry Crab in Phoenix and his mouth began salivating.  So we ended up here, this place was closer than Mesa.  
We were seated quickly and since it was our first time, our server was so gracious to go over how to order our meal.  Luckily I had looked up the menu on their website and looked at pics posted on Yelp to get an idea. My son really wanted blue crab and he was bummed that they did not have that and his second pick of dungeness crab available.  I was relieved.  I did not want to clean crab.  I'm not lazy.  My husband has more patience than I do with cracking and removing the shell from any crustacean.  We settled on shrimp with the Trifecta sauce, and added the sausage and red potato.   Ordered raw oyster and po boy oyster, cause I just love oyster.
My son was so excited when he got his bag of shrimp doused in that yummy Trifecta.  It was messy but oh so delicious!  I taught my son to break off the head and slurp on the head that contained all that yummy goodness, cause that's how Asians do it.  The oysters were really good too, and I slurped that stuff down to savor that briny flavor.  My po boy was pretty good too.
My son plans to return with my husband since they love seafood, especially crab.  Hope they have the blue crab on his next visit."}
{"text":"The fried food isnt any better than what you could get in your grocery store. The crab and shrimp with seasoning is awesome!  Very messy, but worth it!"}
{"text":"very cool constantly good have fresh food available clean inside and very friendly atmosphere, make it bigger"}
{"text":"Took my elderly mother and her friend for lunch on Sunday, May 1. Not the best atmosphere for elderly people, mainly because it is very LOUD.  The food I had was quite good.  I had the grilled mahi mahi over vegetables. The vegetable option is not stated on the menu, but fortunately our server told us about it. The veggies were cooked perfectly tender crisp and there was an amazing variety of 6 or 8 different veggies. Strange that I should make such a big deal about the veggies, but I like veggies! The veggies at most restaurants seem to be an afterthought, unimpressive and ordinary. It was reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service! We had the snow crab legs and shrimp. And it was great!!! Better than red lobster and Joe's Crab Shack! You can break the legs with your fingers there so soft. 
Service was great went on a Friday. All the staff was having a good time and kept checking on us, and our waiter was great too explain how ordering works and recommendations. Will go back again!!!! 
A+"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a shot with my fiance and i'm so glad i did. They serve all the seafood by the pound and you pick the seasoning as well as the heat level. the server Jeff told us the that their spices are pretty hot so we went with medium and it was still hot!! We got some crab and some shrimp and it was absolutely delicious. We have definitely found our new favorite place to eat!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and had a blast every time. The food is always amazing. It is a fun and happy atmosphere. I love bringing out of town guests here its not just dinner its a while experience."}
{"text":"My wife andI tried Angry Crab in phoenix yesterday afternoon.  The place bounces with activity.  It's fun and lively. Our waitress was helpful and attentive.  She was courteous and acted like she really enjoyed her job. Food was delicious and noisy. I felt like Fred Flintstone opening my Blue crab with a stone. My wife had King Crab which was fresh and tasty. Next time we'll split a lobster.  The smallest they had available was 2.3 pounds.  We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"A great place to go if you are ready to dig in and get messy! Our group tried just about everything and the food quality was awesome, especially for the price. I would recommend the shrimp which are huge and super tasty. We also tried the BBQ side of things, which is pretty good, but I prefer the seafood. They also have a pretty good beer list and and TVs to watch sports. The only downside is that it's super messy and a lot of work so you tend to be focused on workin for your food instead of talking to your friends. But if you are up for it, it's great! I'm glad they moved into the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Angry Crab is an excellent choice! It's a seafood bake with the level of spiciness you want. I went with medium (not spicy for me but spicy for my date). You order food individually (seafood, sides, etc). Corn and potatoes are steamed in the bag with your choice of crab/lobster/etc, so the spiciness will be the same, unless you request these be steamed separately. It is  messy (do NOT wear white), and the meals are served on white paper (no plates). A very good experience if you know what you're walking into!"}
{"text":"Now, I'm not much of a yelp-er but I had to give some recognition to this place and the server specifically. I did not have the best luck with food this trip but the server made everything so okay that I wasn't even upset that my order was ruined. 
I ordered the calamari to start since they are doing a \"$19 lobster and Dungeness promotion\" and it was so so. 
I then went to order my Crab and when it came out to the table I was more than excited. I cracked it open and it was not good at all. I was nervous to send back the Dungeness but I was afraid to eat it. I waved the server over, I think her name was Natasha or Natalie, and she hurried right over. I told her the crab had a bit of a smell and she looked so sad and embarrassed to have served me the crab even though it clearly wasn't her fault. She made me feel comfortable even though I was in an uncomfortable situation and got me a pound of snow quickly which was amazing. She continued to check on me and make sure I had everything I needed. I was so impressed that even with as busy as she was she made me feel like I was the only person in the room. I will come back for her."}
{"text":"This is the BEST place to eat. First of all the food is AMAZING! The thing I love and is very rear is that the waiter and waitress are extremely nice. The have good work ethic and seem like they love there job. And when you love your job it shows with the way you treat us as customers. I definitely recommend this place. And a shout out to Shawn (from the Goodyear az restaurant off the Litchfield exit) for being the best waitress I have ever had. I will definitely go back there and request her to wait on me. Just the best. Thank you for an excellent experience."}
{"text":"Good lord, I freakin love this place. Coming from CA the obvious comparison for us is Boiling Crab. I much prefer this place, so sad I don't have it close to home 

They seem to have got the perfect combo of great the 3 P s that make a business great ...product, people and process. From the check in you know your place in line and the service from there is truly exceptional. For a newbie here the concept was explained and I was also reassured that I could add on anything and it would be out within 5 mins and he wasn't kidding. 

My advice is keep to the snow crabs, shrimp and mussels to start. Blue crabs were too small and too much work in this setting. Sides are usually neglected in a place like this but not here. From the coleslaw, red potatoes to gumbo and onion rings were spot on. I would skip on the corn, it was just way too tough. The food was so good and messy it was just an amazing overall experience"}
{"text":"The owner went out of his way to take care of.us and the bartender Kayla was a total sweetheart!!! The snow crab trifecta was killer amazing and the beer so good and cold!! all around absolutely amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"So this is my go to place for crab and crawfish and never had any issues dining in or take out. Called in my order, gave the girl (Cheyenne?) my name and phone number like usual. Walked in to pick up my order and she had a confused look on her face and said oh there's a guy, a husband, saying he called in the same order and just gave my order to him. I'm Sherry, not him! She should've verified name and phone number. Why would you give away someone else's order?! Very disappointed and I walked out. Not sure if you'll be getting my business again...."}
{"text":"Bottom line the crab was great, the service mediocre and the ribs are not worth trying.  I've been to this location twice and have eaten more than my fair share of dungeness crab, snow crab and shrimp.  The trifecta sauces at a medium level was perfect for anyone in my family.  The restaurant was fairly busy and took a little while (15 min) to see our waitress.  We already knew what we wanted, so that 15 min seemed longer in person.  Ice tea was brought out by the hostess with very little ice and was room temp shortly after we got it.  The crab and shrimp was brought out in a reasonable amount of time, but was difficult to eat (at least by the kids) because there were not crackers.  We asked one of the servers that brought our food for some, with no response.  After we asked our waitress for crackers it was another 30 minutes before she brought 1 set for a family of 4.  Later she gave us a rock that helped.  If this was a cheap snack bar maybe I wouldn't hold it against them, but for $160 tab I should at least get some crackers and a pick.  The ribs I will chock up to a lesson learned.  I should have known better than to order ribs at a crab place.  They were dry and very over cooked.  The sauce left an bad after taste that still haunts me.  If you are particular about service and expect some type utensil to enjoy your crab save yourself some frustration and go to Red Lobster or Joes Crab Shack.  If you just want some great crab in a carefree get you hands dirty type place this is it.  All that said I will visit again,  we will be equiped with our own crackers and picks, and I'll stick to the crab."}
{"text":"This is mine and my boyfriends go to seafood place. It is always delicious!!! We order the shrimp and crab legs all the time. Gotta get it as a trifecta! Everything is amazing EXCEPT their water which is so disgusting to drink!! That's why it's a 4 stars for me. Otherwise come here to enjoy some good messy seafood"}
{"text":"My favorite seafood place in Phoenix.  Have been following them since they opened in Mesa, then to Phoenix, Peoria, and finally Goodyear!  I love they are 5 min from my house now.  Have never had a bad experience in any of their locations.  Always get 2 lbs clams / lemon pepper and garlic / 0 spice and 1 lb of snow crabs, same seasoning.  I rave about this place often, and those I've sent there have never been disappointed.  Always delicious."}
{"text":"December 26, 2014 12:35 pm. Spacious parking lot in a strip mall anchored by a Sprouts store. We immediately got seated and we waited on by a pleasant gentleman, Ben. Their menu was simple enough. My advice for the uninitiated in this type of establishment is to start the least spicy the step up on subsequent visits. It's better to be able to be able to eat your food than completely waste it because it was burning your tongue to ashes. We also had tasted their Gator nuggets, it was our first time to ever devour a reptile, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The oysters were good as well. But our personal highlight was the soft-shelled crab. It was fried perfectly and was delicious. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent.  I had the shrimp and my chica had the the snow crab.  Both excellent choices and didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Yum!  Messy, loud, laid back.  Food is excellent!  Our waiter, David, was both a good server and  good looking.  A two-fer!  I ate there on my birthday and had a great time.  My sis' 1st experience and she loved the food...even if she had to eat it with her bare hands. :-0  I love the spices, the ability to choose your flavors and how hot the food is, and the overall experience of diving into your food.  Great place!"}
{"text":"Best seafood ever! Price is great the service was awesome!! Won't go anywhere else for seafood!"}
{"text":"Love IT!!! Local mom and pop, no frills good crab! Arrived after 8 pm on Thursday and the place was packed. Waited a few to be served, but had beverages comp'ed for it.
We appreciated that. They forgot the slaw and cornbread we ordered since they don't write orders down but otherwise a great, fun, messy digging in and getting dirty experience. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and the seafood was great! we ordered a pound of shrimp, pound of clams, pound of king crab with the garlic sauce. i have to say the shrimp was the best. the service was very quick and food was hot. you definately need a bib. the only things i would change would be a paper towel roll and salt and pepper at table and given some wet wipes afterwards. the community sink was a bit to casual for me."}
{"text":"I've been eating here numerous times the food and service are great. However I ran into an issue with one of the order today.  I order 10lbs of shrimp 5 order of sausage, corn, and a kajun fries. I ask the server Tanner if she got everything and she told me that the sausage and corn is in the bag. When I got to my friend house we open up and notice that the only thing missing was the sausage. I call back and told the server Tanner that she forgot the sausage. I got put on hold for about 10 minutes, after 10 min the manager answer the phone I believed her name was Christina and she told me that everybody got the hand on the bag and saw that they put the sausage in the bag. All I wanted is for them to apologize for they might forget. I could careless about the $7 for the sausage. But they kept on insisting that they put the sausage in the bag and in a way saying that I'm lying. This is the first time I encounter this and it will be my last time eating here."}
{"text":"Fat Tuesday, we ordered the shrimp, potatoes, sausage and corn on the cob bag with Cajun sauce and medium heat. So delicious! I wanted hot (we're Latinos and can appreciate spicy hot), but the gal who took our order warned me it was real hot. We love hot and spicy....good thing we went with medium heat, it was still hot, but enjoyable. I can't imagine anything hotter. My co-worker said she got inferno on her visit and her face was red from it being so hot. The oysters were good too. It's a casual place with good food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"The service was awesome the food was amazing!! You must check this place out. Food is offered by the pound. We spent $80 and was stuffed."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Great flavor. Really unique atmosphere. However, eating out of a bag without plates is not my thing. Especially as a lady. But if you're okay with eating in a style back in the stoneages , the food is great !"}
{"text":"It was good... The only reason for the 4 stars is I expect it to be good at $50 a head. It wasn't amazing... but very good and we will be back. I will sneak in a fork though as they don't have silverware which kind of weirds me out when eating a potato."}
{"text":"While the crab and shellfish may be ok our party of four all made mistake of  having fried food. The two ladies had catfish, and the two guys had softshell crab, one por-boy and the other a basket. I had the basket which consisted of soggy sweet potato fries, mediocre coleslaw, and two lumps of breading made to look like softshell crabs because the crabs were so small I doubt that their suppliers catch was legal I literally could taste crab on only two very small bites
and do mean small. It is  too bad because they have a good breading but I ordered softshell crabs not breading.... The por-boy crab sandwich had two nice crabs but the breading was thicker then the crabs. The same was true of the ladies catfish lots of breading little fish.
We spent over $90  and the best we had was  good baked beans on one order and the  frog leg appetizer was decent . that's it. 
Service was good, food I think NOT...."}
{"text":"As long as you like getting messy, the shellfish was pretty solid. Option of several different shellfish and sauces. The waiter misheard my sauce so I didn't get what I ordered, but it was still good food."}
{"text":"This is my honest opinion of this business after my first visit.

There is a weird atmosphere inside this restaurant.  The first thing you will notice is the dozen or so televisions hanging on the walls.  As I parked, it almost gave this place the look of a sports bar (yes, you can see them from outside, very clearly).  As I entered, I noticed the walls are covered in graffiti from customers.  This is a neat idea, however, as the restaurant has only been open a week or two, it was kind of overwhelming to see so much of it already.  I foresee the walls causing issues in the future for them.  This restaurant is also very bright inside.  So bright that it does not make for an intimate dining atmosphere.  Then again, the noise level in there doesn't either.  I had to raise my voice to be heard across the table a few times.

The menu is not well designed.  It's weird that the seafood and meats have separate side dishes.  The waiter was very hesitant to sub out my side for what I really wanted.  Before ordering we were warned that all of their spice levels were off.  The \"no spice\" sauces were equal to a mild, the mild sauces were equal to medium and so on.  

Service was very strange.  After ordering, one of my side dishes was brought to me right away by a random staff member.  Several minutes later another staff member brought out the entire meal of the person with whom I visited this restaurant.  I had to wait 7 or 8 minutes for the rest of my food arrived.  We ordered fish n chips with bbq beans and cajun fries, and pulled pork with ACQ sauce, bbq beans, and corn on the cob with melted butter.  I have to say, I loved the cajun fries and the ACQ sauce.  The pulled pork was bland without sauce.  The bbq beans weren't that good.  The corn was served in a bag with more melted butter in it than corn.  The fish n chips were very spicy (and I don't think they were supposed to be).  I emptied my drink on the first of the pieces of fish.  My waiter attended the tables flanking mine, and refilled my guest's drink, but never offered to refill mine.  My mouth was so on-fire after the second piece of fish that I had to stop another member of the waitstaff and ask them to refill my drink.

I also found it strange that there was a kids menu when in the middle of the restaurant is a huge bar area, and several of the female waitstaff walk around in tank-tops with their cleavage exposed.  Not very family-friendly for kids.  I get that this place is supposed to be relaxed and laid back, but professionalism is still important.

I would probably order bbq to-go from here, but I don't think this would be a place I would stop to eat in the future."}
{"text":"We love the Angry Crab, in Peoria.  But this location is in a ghetto, on Indian School.  We were greeted by the bartender, who was very nice.  He seated us, and told us Maria, would be our waitress.  He took our drink orders, and delivered them quickly.  Then came Maria.  She was in a bad mood, and mumbled.  Our whole experience was negative with her.  She was the worse excuse for a waitress I ever had!  I'm 60, and tip even when service sucks, but not with her.  I wrote her a note about how bad she was.  Stay away from this ghetto dump.  It is filthy to boot!"}
{"text":"This post is to help people prevent making the same mistake I did. 

Don't order shrimp, unless you enjoy paying to pull shrimp out of a bag full of sauce. Then peeling a full shrimp, after you cut the head off of course. Perhaps the worst meal experience I've had in years. Why would anybody want to pay $17 to work to eat a lunch and create a mess all over yourself?? Or maybe the waiter should explain that to you before you order. 

Didn't try the meat market, but I'm sure it's not bad."}
{"text":"Great king crab at a reasonable price. Try the Trifecta sauce with a 3 on the spice scale. Its has a bite! Great service by Autumn and the only thing you could add would be a view of the ocean."}

The service was great!
The food was delicious"}
{"text":"Came in with my to celebrate A late Mother's Day at the lunch hour!

Let me begin with the service which was great. The knowledge of the  menu was helpful. Just wish our waitress knew more about the beers.
Ok let me begin with the beer problem half of the selection was not available! Then when we did get served with out beers they where warm. I gave up and did try a hurricane.. Wish I had not! No flavor what so ever.
We had the  barbecue and the shrimp boil. The barbecue was ok the cole slaw and beans not so great but the pulled pork and brisket were good. The shrimp were cooked perfectly! 
We might try one more time to see how the beer situation goes. We do like our beer and everyone has bad day so that's a maybe."}

Hostess ignored us and we waited in line for some time. She wasn't very friendly and I grabbed my own crayons for my kid. Besides that place was great!"}

Also They have an obnoxious siren that sounds when you order something hot...it loud and pretty annoying.    I really don't care who likes it hot!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE the food and good service....HOWEVER:  We were seated at a 2 person table that was very close to other tables.  I understand the concept of business and turning tables but, every customer or wait staff person hit the back of my chair.  It was non stop the entire evening as we were there on a crowded Saturday night.  If they removed just one 2 seater or maybe 2, the experience would have been perfect.

It was uncomfortable and very annoying.  None of the wait staff seemed to even give it a second thought."}
{"text":"My friends LOVE this place, but I wasn't all that excited about it. Hate the (literal) writing on the walls. The whole place has the vibe of a roadside dive, which I think is a weird vibe to want in the middle of a city. Food is fine, but didn't drive me crazy with deliciousness."}
{"text":"I lived in Fla most of my life. And this was my first time at the Angry Crab. I have missed having great seafood since I moved to AZ. But let me tell you this is as close as it gets to Fla seafood. It is wonderful!!   Fresh seafood and really nice people. Keep up the good work"}

The service is very good.  The fried cod is prepared perfectly."}
{"text":"Such great service from the very start. My husband and I were welcomed as soon as we walked in and then seated right away (It helped that we went there for lunch). Our waitress Amy was super nice and funny. I love that!! Keep up the great work Amy!! The food was amazing. First time trying the crawfish and we loved it. We also got the shrimp it was so good and had a good amount of meat in it. I can't wait until we have another chance to go before our kiddos come home from summer vacation (they aren't big on sea food)!! I highly recommend going here for sure. Way better than Red Lobster or Joe's crab shack hands down!"}
{"text":"We happened to drive by this place not even knowing about it. My family are huge sea food eaters as I am not. But this place is absolutely amazing. Service is fast servers are very respectful. We will never go to another sea food restaurant after eating here. Only down fall is this place is so popular they don't have enough room and they don't have southern sweet tea.  Hoping they will expand soon. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Yeah, not impressed. I've been to many Cajun seafood restaurants. Florida, Texas, Louisiana. Nope. They missed the mark. $15 Softshell Crab Po-boy. I asked for a small adjustment to my order \"No\" its either this way or that way. No going the extra mile here. 2 draft beers and a Po-boy for $27!?! I'll be poor alright!"}
{"text":"When my hubby and I go to the angry crab, we make sure we say everything before the meal comes..because when it arrives we dont talk..we just eat and eat until we are done. You will hear some noises of ecstasy when we are eating the trifecta snow crab legs..we always start the meal with the fried shrimp basket with the Cajun fries and beans. And then we three pounds of snow crab with corn and potatoe. We Absolutely live this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great it reminds me of eating seafood back east with the paper in the bibs it is absolutely fabulous"}
{"text":"Unhappy 1/2 hour.  Arrived for happy hour and our party was seated in the booth we didn't really want (but all the others were dirty - with the help having no interest in cleaning another for us).  Sat in the booth for ten minutes without acknowledgement.  The four of us moved to the bar seats.  We were handed menus nicely enough, but then the service disappeared again, no acknowledgement, no orders placed.  Waited another ten minutes, watched the help argue with one another about goings-on, got impatient and left.
We were fans of Angry Crab when it opened and have become less so over time.  Haven't been to Angry Crab in six months but I suggested we give it another chance.  Oh well, we won't be back.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time yesterday. First off our server was Dawn and she was very friendly and knowledgable about the menu.  she was very fast and nice. Actually all the staff was friendly. The oysters were okay, we got the shrimp with the trifecta with sausage and corn. Gets a little messy lol but it was very delicious!"}
{"text":"Today was my 3rd visit and I won't be rushing back anytime soon.  Yes, the seafood is as fresh as you can find in Phoenix (Upside) but the service (poor, immediately followed by rude), a couple of major flaws in the presentation, and the value (not the price, but what you get) made for a miserable meal.  For the 3 of us, we ordered a Dungeness Crab, Shrimp, and a side of fries.  The fries came out almost immediately and the waitress said the rest would be out in a few minutes.  We said we'd like the side served with the rest of the meal and she said \"we serve everything when it's ready\".  We asked her to take the fries back and bring fresh when the rest of the meal came and she said \"I'll take them back, but they're just going to sit and get cold so you might as well keep them\".  She took them and left and I was about ready to leave too.  She did return in a few minutes and said they put in a fresh order so we stayed put.
There's a problem with the way the shrimp are presented.  When they hit the table they are fine.  By the time you're done eating they are tough.  Sitting in a bag of boiling hot sauce for 5 or 10 minutes results in overcooked seafood.  Too bad that was not obvious until it was too late.
The quarrel I have with the crab presentation was that it was served with the carapace left on.  Almost impossible to remove; gills, guts and scalding water everywhere. The claws and legs were OK size wise but the body was downright miniscule.  I would generously estimate that we got 4 or 5 ounces of edible meat out of a $36 crab. And $100+ per pound for crab meat when you are doing all the dirty work yourself is nonsense."}
{"text":"Tonite I went the shrimp scrawny not their usual service very disappointed.  I've gone to the Mesa location & OMG big juicy shrimp & snow crab this time I was very disappointed.  The shrimp scrawny she'll was stuck to the shrimp.  I felt like the hoodwinked me this was just bad. Not happy at all."}
{"text":"Very good food. Smelled like crab for a week... But so worth it. I love that you can choose your crab flavor and the appetizer selections are so fun!"}
{"text":"I have been looking high and low in Chandler/Tempe area for good seafood (yes, I know there is no ocean close by) with  a Raw Bar atmosphere. Guess what, found it. The Angry Crab Shack in Mesa is it! Yes, the name is a little silly, but the food is the real deal. Casual atmosphere, fresh seafood and good service. I've had the raw oysters, crawfish, dungeness crab, Cajun fries and the hush puppies...of course with a Kilt Lifter or two to wash it down with. Good stuff for a coastal guy. If you love fresh seafood in a causal environment, this is the place."}
{"text":"What is this photo?  It's my meal absent my wife's meal.  She ordered a sandwich, mind you had grill marks on the bread, was cold to the touch.  She told the server that the \"toasted bread\" of the sandwich and the fries on the side were served cold.  Server proceeded to tell the manager, Dawn, that the toasted bread of the sandwich and fries were cold who then instructed the kitchen to \"heat the bread or something\".  Food did come back looking like it was remade, however Dawn decided to come to our table and give us a talk.

Manager Dawn proceeded to talk to my wife, as if she is a twelve year old, only to detail that parts of the sandwich will be cold which is fully understand from the jump.  However, Dawn didn't explain why fries and toasted bread would be colder than a December game at Lambeau Field.  Might as well have served a frozen block of fries and given her an ice pick to eat them.


Very disheartening- I really like the food here... server nor management had any effort to give us a customer-like service.  

P.S I'm not looking for any comps or anything as I really won't be coming back."}
{"text":"i was in a dream world the
entire time...the smells the
shells trifecta shrimp, sausage,
corn & potato...gumbo yummy...
i must say party...my bib was drenched...garlic...mac n cheese!
come & get it!! we b there 3 times a month...stuffed!"}
{"text":"Best seafood in town, great atmosphere and staff is so much fun. My personal favorites are the snow crab with trifecta, gumbo, or catfish ... but the over the moon is the softshell crab. I go by once or twice a week and it never disappoints. Love this place and everything they serve - recommend it to anyone looking for a NOLA style boil and some of the best food around"}
{"text":"The first time I was here, I loved the food. The second time however, I was appalled at my treatment. Having just moved into the neighborhood, I brought my fiance here for his birthday. We waited outside for a table, and the kitchen cooks slammed the door into my back while sitting in a chair. At first I thought I had just been blocking an exit, but when I opened the door, the cooks were doubled over laughing at me. My fiance was upset enough to ask for the manager, (Ed) who told me that they were laughing at something else. He made many excuses, never asked if I was okay, and never offered a sincere apology. He did offer me a beer on him, which I declined because I was not interested in free drinks/food, I was there for an experience that the staff and Ed took away from us. I will not trade my dignity for free beer."}
{"text":"Have you been to Hot and Juicy?  This is very similar.  

Try the ...
Shrimp
King crab
Sausage
Potato
Sweet potato fries"}
{"text":"food is extremely good, i have prawn and snow crab with trifesta sauce. although i have a few prawn that is not so fresh but the rest is good."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow . Our waitress did a nice job going over the menu. Food had great flavor. It was a bit pricey for lunch. Great atmosphere. Be ready to pay extra for potatoes, corn and vegetables in the boils."}
{"text":"Best seafood in Arizona! I always get the pound of headless shrimp trifecta. The snow crab is great too. The wait times can be long but it's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"We just love coming here! I'm so happy to have this place in our neighborhood. We love the relaxed atmosphere, the incredible food, and most of the servers we have had have been great (we especially love Victoria). 
The only thing I have an issue with is the spice level isn't always the same. Most of the time I like a 2. Once it was so flipping HOT so next time I got a 1. That one was so bland so I got a side of 2 and that was not hot  enough and it kind of ruined my shrimp. Last time I got the two and it was perfect. They charge for the little sides, not much but I would prefer them to just be more consistent. It sure hasn't stopped us from coming back. We eat here way more than we probably should!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat. Similar to other seafood bag restraints but his had some awesome BBQ to go with it. I had the brisket and ribs with a lb of shrimp.  We were starving and still couldn't finish the meal. Briskets melts in your mouth and normally I would not pass up the great rib but the brisket stole the show. Shrimp was cooked well and tasted great. Cost was reasonable. There was a bar and a lot of people celebrating birthdays. It is a family environment. Definitely would return for the brisket."}
{"text":"great food, great service. can't beat the price on seafood.I will absolutely be going back and bringing my family with me. a must visit."}
{"text":"Lot of boiling crab type spots in Vegas and OC. This place is on point with all of them.
Was seated  right away. Another person came over to get me started while the infamous Noel from other reviews was busy. So I tried the hurricane. Nice. After that Noel took over and the rest was history. King crab legs , potatoes , corn, & sausage. Trifecta sauce at a three and it was on. All crab ,potatoes, and corn gone. Got the sauce and some sausage for fried rice tomorrow plus two cookies. The atmosphere is exactly what I expected , low key seafood shack. I will be back on a regular basis as long as they keep up the good service and great food.  Noel definitely  deserves his good reputation as does the rest of the staff."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of boiling crab so I'm always on the lookout for anything similar when I'm away. This hits as close to home as possible. I got the 1 lb shrimp, trifecta and mild. I know I shouldn't compare to boiling crab, but it's always my baseline for seafood nowadays. The sauce is great, lacks a little bit of flavor compared to BC, and has a little too much pepper. The other issue is that the sauce is too oily. The oil seems to seep through the bag and all over the table. So if you go, really prepare to dig your hands through some oil. 

We also ordered the po'boy sliders which were delicious! One of my fav things about Anrgry Crab Shack are the delicious fries, make sure to get those along with your seafood meal. Service is also outstanding here. Everyone is friendly and helpful!

So I guess my minus 1 star is the fact the sauce is too oily and the sauce just needs a little more flavor."}
{"text":"The snow crab legs are fantastic! They are boiled in a bag, and you have to crack it yourself, but it's worth it. The service is great. Best seafood in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, maybe even best seafood in the state. I will DEFIANTLY come back!!!!!





:)"}
{"text":"My husband ordered blue crab which came out raw. He then asked for catfish instead and that came out raw?! How does this happen? The servers were apologetic, but i think our meals should have been comped at this point. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Got a recommendation from a friend to try this place and I think I had a different expectation; based on his raving review. I called the restaurant at 4:00pm to make are reservation. They said they do not take reservations. I asked what is the typical wait on a Saturday night for dinner around 6, the woman said 20 min. PERFECT. My wife and I head to the Angry Crab and when we put our name in there was a 50 minute wait. The restaurant is small for being a 'crab house' and the place is only a few months old so I expected a longer wait.. They had seats outside for waiting, but no patio seating for diners. Not a big deal, but it was a great night for outdoor dining (75 degrees). The shopping center looked a little 'sketchy' due to amount of vacant store fronts, so there wasn't even much window shopping to do during our almost 1 hour wait. 

Now on to the food, the wait staff was friendly and dress uniformly. The waitress was fast with our drinks, which came in a plastic, foam or cardboard (fast food style) cup. But I like 'divey' as much as the next guy, so no complaints here.... yet....  
The food came quickly, but we were only given 1 set of seafood utensils. So after asking and waiting almost 10 minutes a new set came to the table. During this time my wife and I had to share... again... not really a big deal, but not the ideal situation. 

My wife and I ordered oysters on the 1/2 shell, and fried calamari for an appetizer. We got pretty hungry during our 50 minute wait. For our entree we both got snow crab, sausage, corn for our main meal. The oysters were AWESOME. I would highly recommend them. The calamari came with a sauce that looked like marinara, however had a fierce bite. I like spicy, and if you like spicy I would recommend. If you do not like spicy definitely stay away. Our entree came in a plastic bag that you open and eat out of. They do not give you a plate or any metal forks or knives. So most of your meal is eaten with your hands. Don't wear your Sundays Best because there is a good chance you will get crab juice on you at some point during the meal. I got the 'trifecta' seasoning which has good flavor, however I thought the crab was a little small compared to other places, like Joes crab shack. 

At the end of the meal the bill was reasonable considering the amount of food ordered and a better value than Joe's Crab Shack. I am not sure I would drive past Joe's to get to this place, but if I was in the mood for crab and didnt mind the 'divey' atmosphere, then I would go again."}
{"text":"this was my go to restaurant for seafood until i got pregnant recently but now that I can eat seafood I recently came and it was not what it was before. I always ordered king crab and I would get the whole crab but I recently came and I should have complained honestly because i paid so much i feel like. I used to get the legs or arms whatever and the the chest and i came and I literally only got like a few pieces of legs and ugh it was just sad even my boyfriend was depressed. Definitely not a fan anymore. If they keep this up they will loose people and all these restaurants they just made might not even last."}
{"text":"Fresh seafood in the desert at affordable prices?  Yes please! This place won't disappoint. Ambience and service is great too. We tried the lobster, mussels, clams and the catfish. Everything was tasty. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Few things in a ordinary foodie's life can be compared to the moment at Angry Crab Shack when a bag of seafood arrives the table."}
{"text":"I love the other locations I've been to chandler/Mesa & Indian school)  but was not please with the not so friendly staff/lack of customer service... Stood at the door to be seated on. A non busy week day around 12/1 then after being stared at but all the staff and not helped we attempted to seat are selves and was told sorry we are not seating/serving in that area ... All its not what you say it's how you say it ,,, & it was said as if we were a bother sum ,,, So we just walked out ... Which sucks because I was excited to try out this location but because of the lack of customer service I doubt I'll be back !!"}
{"text":"Another winner! Great service and great food. Between the four of us, we shared two pounds of their Monday mix of snow crab, clams, shrimp, and vegetables. We also added a pound of snow crab with corn, potatoes, and sausage. At their recommendation, we went with the trifecta sauce - mild. It spice level was just perfect. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Great atmosphere - very fun and lively. Prices are fair for what you get. Great seafood. Couldn't be happier. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"What happened? This place used to be amazing!! It seems now the focus is expanding and not the product. Over the years the quality of the food, the service and the whole vibe of the place has gone downhill. I used to think we just came on an off day or before a shipment but it keeps happening. Please go back to the way it was! We don't mind a wait for good food! Spend money on better crab! Add enough sauce in the bag to cover the crab and dip in! Go back to the old gloves that stayed on your hands! These days your food isn't any better than Joe's."}
{"text":"too bad i can't leave zero stars! felt sick before i could walk out the restraunt!  came here a month ago pretty good... today oily salt greasy food. shrimp tasted foul. never coming back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was great, refills frequent and server was awesome (Meiesha)! King Crab-delicious! Pulled pork sandwich-delicious! Cornbread- extremely delicious! Baked beans-insanely delicious. Fried cod-delicious! Fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My DH and I tried this for the first time tonight and definitely are going to be regulars!!  The staff was friendly and very attentive and answered all our questions readily.  This place is SO much better than Joe's Crab Shack and much more dollar friendly!  I had the sweet King Crab and my DH had the Soft Shell Crab with fries.  Everything was fantastic and the heat level was not too much for us at all.  I only had the level 1 but will likely try #2 next time.  Looking forward to trying everything on the ample menu.  So glad to have this kind of restaurant in the neighborhood!!  Good Food, Good Service and a Fun Time on a chilly Friday night!"}
{"text":"First time here and this place has amazing food!! My server Will was so attentive and helpful!! Will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Honestly its not a Boiling Crab! But thats why its called Angry Crab Shack, people honestly this is one of the Best Seafood Places to come to Arizona! If you dont like it the feel free to enjoy the 400 mile ride to Cali honestly! At least some Genius finally brought this out to us, and we talked with him and all of his fish is shipped fresh then frozen at the most a day.....sooo me and my boyfriend will definetly be coming back!!! ^.^ So Delicious! But definetly try the Trifecta Shrimp (similar to Whole ShaBang from Boiling Crab)! Oh and yes the shrimp do come with heads attatched, but it just enhances the flavor! I do recommend to come Early maybe on a weekday, to get good service and avoid the rush! Other than that till next time Angry Crab Shack! ^.^"}
{"text":"Very good crab, I'm a garlic-holic and the bag was amazing with the butter and garlic in it! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  The food is fresh and prepared well and the price is decent.  The brisket is beautiful and the smoked chicken is the best I've had.  
There is also this hot guy that works there that I try to see when I go.  He works in the kitchen....looks Samoan maybe?  Black rimmed glasses and juicy lips.  Short black hair.  Great smile.  If you see this message me!  Hahaha.  
They've got a great chocolate cake too."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill.  Undercooked shrimp and overcooked salmon.  It smells awful, there are flies everywhere.  Boooo.
There was sand in my vegetable boil bag.  There were also unidentifiable veggies in there, some weird white blob thing.  My experience was so bad that I will not be returning."}
{"text":"So typically I write a pretty detailed review, but I honestly have nothing to complain about, nothing that I would ask to be changed. 
The food was dammmnnn good and fast. It took 10 minutes for my order to arrive. I was starving so this was great!!!! Service was impeccable..I think everyone in the building checked in with us and it wasn't intrusive inquires.
I had the shrimp and snow crab in the most popular sauce (it was a mix of three others..) and it was exceptional!
Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite location. I've been here once and maybe 3-4 times at the Peoria location. When we arrived it was packed. But we didn't care. We went to the bar to wait, then ended up staying there because the service was amazing. We were next to the POS system so many servers would turn around and talk to us. There was one waitress that was talkative and friendly but made us feel awkward with the way she would look at us. Not a big deal but just random. Lol. 

FYI, their Bloody Mary's are beyond amazing! A must if you like them. They put a crab leg in it and asparagus. I was so blown away!

Also, get the gumbo. And a tip: Ask for the rice on the side so you get more gumbo!!! And if you get sausage with your meal, add it in as well. If not it's amazing as is.

I just love this place!"}
{"text":"This 1 star review is not for the food......the food was a solid 5. But it was over shadowed by the distractions of the management and wait staff. I felt like I was watching a three ring circus. It seems VERY poorly managed. A lot of help just standing around, talking loud and inappropriately, looking like they had nothing to do. I could see the kitchen was hustling and bustling so I wondered why the kitchen seemed maybe under staffed and the front had people standing around....perhaps the kitchen staff just knows how to work!!  I was shocked when our waitress pointed out the female manager.....VERY VERY inappropriately dressed, very unprofessional, terrible attitude. Clearly she is the problem here. My advice to the owners is to get a new manager before it's too late. The Mesa location, without a doubt, appears to be much better managed."}
{"text":"The food was okay, not superb. We went during the off hours and the service was good but we were not overwhelmed by the taste of the food. The Dungeness crab was overpriced for the quality. Nice lunch spot but I wouldn't frequent this establishment."}
{"text":"The service was excellent but the food was not as good as hot and juicy.    We ordered calamari , alligator meat and shrimp by the pound.   The calamari was good but the shrimp was not fresh. Some of the shrimp was soft and old.   Also don't order the bread it's sour dough and hard .  Giving it three stars because the waitress was nice. If it was just for the food it would only be two stars."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great service and good food. It's loud and that's how we like it. It reminds me of the crab shacks in Ocean City, Maryland."}
{"text":"Angry Crab Shack is a bit of a drive for us since we are in North Phoenix but we've never been to a place like this and were really wanting to check it out. The drive was totally worth it and I'm so glad we went!!

I love shrimp so that's what we were going for our first time here. We got a pound each of Trifecta and Kajun, both at medium heat.

The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious. Medium was the perfect heat for us. Trifecta is amazing. It's an awesome blend of the Kajun heat plus a hint of lemon pepper and garlic. Straight Kajun was just as good.

Definitely add in the corn and a few potatoes to your order. They are cooked in the same bag and are a great compliment to the meal.

We will be back for sure. I've never been a big crab or lobster person but I will definitely have some here. I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Went here for a second time yesterday. Wanted to let my uncle experience the same fun we had last time however this time was a bit disappointing to say the least. What was phenomenal last was a little below average this time. Giving 3 stars this time around bc I enjoyed it the first time. Ordered the exact same thing as I did the first time here however everything was over cooked! Alligator was dry as toast the oysters were over cooked and small, crab legs and shrimp were WAY over cooked and tasted like rubber. My uncle said that the experience was cool but the food wasn't something he enjoyed. I asked the waiter to bring me a side of hot sauce he brought me mild sauce. Don't plan on stopping here for at least the next 5 months to see if the cooks and waiters can get their act together by then. Crazy enough I wanted the waiter to bring us bibs for fun :) to take some pictures, that didn't happen so I had to walk over and grab them myself..."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the angry crab! My boyfriend and I saw it tucked into the corner of the strip mall and decided to try it out and oh my gosh we were not disappointed!! I hadn't had crab legs that good in years!! My
Boyfriend also had the snow crab legs and we have been telling everyone we know that they need to try it! The atmosphere is awesome and I loved the decor. It was comfortable eating and we didn't feel rushed   We took our time and just throughly enjoyed it! We will definitely be back! Super yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Great place! Service is great! The staff are so friendly and helpful. The food is really good and very well prepared. Very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Sooooo good! We went a few days ago and I can't wait to go back! The hush puppies are a little spicy but not too much. I got a pound of snow crab legs in the trifecta with a mild spice level, and added a couple potatoes and corn on the cob. My husband got almost the same, but with crawfish instead of crab legs. Delicious! Be prepared to eat everything with your hands. Don't worry, there's a hand washing station. It's great for the whole family."}
{"text":"I am super picky and this was AMAZING
We tried a bunch of different stuff and I loved it all!! We will be back!!! 
I am used to crawfish in the south and this was good even though it was frozen (I was very hesitant to get it but I'm glad I did)! 
Don't deprive yourself- go try it!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. About as pricey if not cheaper than a Joe's Crab Shack without the cheap chain feeling.

We tried the Cowboy BBQ Brisket sandwich with the onions: So Smokey you'd think Willie Nelson was there smokin' it. 

We also got the Medium Trifecta Clams with vegetables. Just an incredible sauce and the perfect about of heat. 

We'll be back."}
{"text":"This was our first visit, and while I think the food was okay; the price for the amount of food you get is not worth it. Same goes for waitress: she did okay but definitely didn't go out of her way to make us feel welcome."}
{"text":"Went for a birthday party.  Wonderful shrimp. I recommend this restaurant good Cajun seasoning fast service and friendly service. What an assortment of good food and kid friendly.  The waitress even put the game we wanted to watch on the TV"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with hubby, because he wanted BBQ and I love Cajun/Creole food.  I was greatly disappointed.  I had a crab poboy and gumbo; hubby got a pull pork sandwich.  The crab is not fresh and bun is not good, and it cost me $13+.  The gumbo and pull pork are acceptable, but they are not good enough to have us visit here again."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum!!!  This place is fun.  The waitstaff is helpful.  The food is delish.  I would go once a week if my significant other was on board.  Even my grandkids like it.  I have, so far, always gotten crab - either king or dungeness - with spicy sauce.  It has always been amazing.  I would like to try the fresh oysters because I love those guys, but it is hard not to just dive into the crab.  Check it out"}
{"text":"Love this place! Came here twice during the week I was in Phoenix. Eating from bags of seafood is so fun, so definitely come here with a group of people who are prepared to get messy! And I recommend the trifecta sauce - so good. Cannot wait to come back here again."}
{"text":"If you are from the south and know your poboys...DO NOT rpt DO NOT order one from here. It's a shrimp sandwich on a split top roll like from Costco. Anyone knows the bread makes a poboy as much as what you put in it. The hard crusty fried shrimp was equally bad and I think there were like 3. It was the saddest excuse for a poboy I had ever witnessed. Of course I get the place isn't called Angry Poboy...it's the angry crab. Not really sure I'll be back in any case."}
{"text":"Loved it. Staff was attentive and made sure we had waters,beers and food coming. We had the crawfish,mussels,crab legs and shrimp. The seasoning had a perfect balance of Cajun spices and garlic. Get the trifecta with some corn and sausages in your bag. Sausage isn't spicy but a good add to your bag. Highly recommend it. Nice edition to AZ since we only see these in Southern California. Stick to what you're doing. ."}
{"text":"Food great. Only problem is when you order the side potato and corn in your bag make sure you have it. I ordered both 1 corn and 5 potatoes and didn't get my corn and only 3 potatoes.  corn bread is great. Definitely try that. Overall okay experience"}
{"text":"We were in search of raw oysters.  We found them here with a lot more.  Awesome place for good southern/gulf coast cookin'.  Super service, great wine/beer prices during happy hour and seafood cooked with spices as you like it.  Can't wait to try the BBQ.  I don't post to Yelp  much, but had such a great unexpected experience, that would give this place the highest rating.  Outdoor seating a plus."}
{"text":"Prices were okay. Food was okay. Service was sub-par. No drink refills offered. We had to ask for napkins. Forks are plastic, so no good for digging into crab legs. Seafood choices are just that. Sides are extra. Any seafood you order is somewhat spicy as their basic choice, then you can choose to have it more spicy, but not less spicy. Seafood is served in plastic bags...no plates offered. My husband enjoyed his BBQ, but not enough to choose this place for BBQ. We won't be back.

I've read other reviewers raves about Barb. Either got a different Barb or she was having an off night. Besides the complaints listed above about the service, I had ordered cornbread which I never got. I ended up calling her over and asking her to make sure to remove it from our ticket. I never did check to make sure she did that."}
{"text":"The traditional boil flavor was great.  Service was pretty standard, but the fresh seafood made up for it.  If you come get the shrimp and mussels."}
{"text":"I had fried fish basket and it was GREAT.  Love the Cajun fried.  My friend enjoyed the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich and raved about it."}
{"text":"Service sucks most times but the food is great! One pd shrimp done in lvl 1 w trifecta sauce and a side of lvl 2 trifecta sauce, 4 potatoes and 2 orders of sausage fills up 2 of us every time. You eat w your hands and I miss new Orleans every day I go there"}
{"text":"Ate there twice we were so happy with the food, drinks and service!  Mary was our server one night and our bartender the next - beyond awesome!  The snow crab legs were awesome - with options of spices and sauces and the cod was to rave about.  And they have discounts available with same day spring training game tickets of buy one get half off another entree.  Prices are fairly reasonable."}
{"text":"I had the ribs and friend had the shrimp.  Ribs were OK and friend said shrimp were great!

Service was slow and ribs were out 5 min shrimp."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews I decided while I was in Phoenix that I would definitely check out Angry Crab. OMG-it was so good, in fact it was so good that I made another trip there before I left Phoenix. The first night I went there I had Justin as my waiter. He was an excellent waiter and he had the best personality. He gave us excellent customer service. I ordered the level 3 which is suppose to be hot, it wasn't (but it was still good). We ordered, lobster, shrimp and two types of crab. Out of everything the snow crab was my favorite. The second time I went I had a waiter that wasn't very good (cannot remember his name). This time I ordered the level 4 of the snow crab. The waiter kept trying to talk me out of getting it and kept telling me that I wouldn't be able to eat it. Also I wanted kajun (their spelling), traditional boil and garlic sauce. The waiter kept telling me I should get the trifecta (which I didn't want) and then he tells me that he has never placed an order like that (WTH?!). He then proceeded to tell another table what I ordered and they all looked at me crazy (which I found very rude and unprofesional). The order came and OMG level 4 was what I wanted and needed! Eating my snow crab and drinking my Stella I was in heaven. The waiter was shocked that I could eat and finish the crab at that level (whatever-I like hot and spicy food). Seriously why should you care what I order as long as I pay for it?! If I ever travel back to Phoenix this will be the first place that I go too but I would try and find Justin's section. 

Some advice: wear something you do not care about and wash your clothes immediately. I wore something I didn't care about but the smell stayed in my clothes for awhile. I had to have the hotel clean them because I couldn't take the smell anymore. Also if you go during the week early you will not have to wait. Go on a Friday night at 7:30 and you are going to wait 45-60 minutes to be seated."}
{"text":"On our first visit, we walked into the Angry Crab Shack about ten minutes before closing. (I wouldn't recommend doing that bc they were out of a couple of things on their menu)  & we had a great time.  The servers were all very nice & service was great ~ even though we walked in at the last minute.  
The food was excellent.  A fun & casual place that I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I am from Houston near the Gulf and we have lots of Great Seafood!!! On business trips n Phoenix and needed a seafood fix so I thought I would check this place out. I was served by Mimi and she did an Awesome job and best service ever. The food is Totally Awesome and also a Great Value!!!! Do Not Miss this place if you are in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say, it's like a Famous Dave's or a Lucille's, but the ribs are from the sea floor. The fried oysters & hush puppies were pretty good, and the crab legs were delicious. I also enjoyed both the raw & charred oysters. On a Friday, the ambience was busy; there was a lot of activity in the front of the house and I could only assume the back of the house was even busier. The people are friendly; I would recommend this place for families and small groups. It's a good spot for a date night, but expect to get a little messy!"}
{"text":"First of all, I have to admit that's place likely had me the second I walked in the door: lively soul music, the aroma of good food, bar with New Orleans local brews. But I'm really picky about Arizona versions of New Orleans-style food, having lived in the Big Easy and getting hooked on the cuisine. Fortunately the food overwhelmed my skepticism, being authentic and flavorful. I've now had numerous things on the menu and have yet to be disappointed. The first time I got one of the boils, I understood why a newspaper described it as the place to go on a third date: you'll immediately discover how adventurous your companion is. Be careful if you don't like spicy because after level 2 it's only for die-hards (I usually get the 3). I recommend the trifecta spice with whatever seafood I want that night. And a true Nawlin's citizen will only order the crawfish when it's in-season, not frozen. If you don't like seafood, there's still enough to choose from to keep you happy and satisfied.

Laissez les bon temp rouler!! (Let the good times roll)"}
{"text":"Love love love the shrimps. The king crab legs never disappoints either. One negative- multiple times I have ordered fresh oysters and they just did not taste fresh. I love fresh oysters and I found it really hard to eat these due to the scent and dinginess. Went to the one on Alma School and had a much more positive experience with their fresh oysters. I found this odd.

Bbq brisket makes it worth coming here for sure! Full of favor, melt in your month tenderness, just all that you've been looking for! 

Their spice scale is legit too. I can handle a 4 out of 5 pretty well. It gets me sweating however if I up it to a level 5 out of 5- whoooooo! I'm usually crying as I'm eating. If you want to watch your calorie intake- ask for water base instead of butter. It's not as fun to eat but the favors get across. Ohh and it tends to be a lot more spicer if you go water base. Just FYI"}
{"text":"I have to admit I wasn't looking forward to this restaurant. Our friends suggested it and I do not eat seafood. It's a very loud place, full of energy, great for large parties. I asked the waitress for her suggestions since I don't eat animals. She said I could order a bag of veggies (every meal is cooked in a bag?) and she could request that they use regular water instead of seafood water. She also suggested steamed rice. I ordered the \"mild\" sauce and I have to say it was delicious. Very full of flavor-spices-not fishy flavored at all. I also ordered extra veggies-a potato and corn on the cob. They forgot to add those to my bag but the waitress promptly brought them out to me. It is a very casual place, you are even encouraged to eat with your hands. It can be quite messy, and even though they give you plastic bibs to wear, don't wear a white shirt if you go!"}
{"text":"My husband and I go there once a week since last year. We LOVE seafood. Unfortunately, I regretfully say that this place is a hit and miss for us. Some weeks are good, fresh and saucy. Some weeks can be completely opposite. I never thought about writing a review until our experience last week. 
We ordered medium chicken wings and hot trifecta 2 lbs of shrimp. The wings came out SUPER spicy (probably hot) and the shrimp came out plain ( 99% butter and 1% spices). When we ordered we asked to make sure we have enough sauce but they came in almost dry. My husband and I love this place but we just never know what we will get that night. We just dodge the bullet and hopefully they will be better than last week."}
{"text":"Our first trip to Angry Crab Shack, and we loved it!  Very busy when we got there at 5pm on a Saturday,  and quite a line waiting to get in when we left.  The place was lively,  but not too loud or obtrusive. Great rustic decor, with paper tablecloths, simple paper menus, and plastic bibs.  Many choices on the menu.   Sooooooo hard to make a choice!

We shared an order of hush puppies that were fried to perfection with the perfect amount of heat from peppers and spice, and a nice dipping sauce.  I had the softshell crab w/ Cajun fries, and potato salad. Loved it all.  Just enough spice on everything to make it interesting.  My wife had the crawfish pohboy, which was equally good.  My son had the fried shrimp.  Excellent, with no oily/heavy fried taste.  Very clean and tasty.

All in all, a great unique experience in the Phoenix Valley.  Great to have a choice like this available to us.  Nice job, Angry Crab Shack!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and wonderful staff. I ordered the shrimp po boy but was extremely disappointed. Tiny piece of shrimp, bland flavor, wouldn't order it again. Because Az lacks good seafood, I am going to try once more with what they're famous for, by the pound seafood. Try this spot, just don't order the po boy."}
{"text":"Nice place to get your hands dirty!
Crab legs were nice and thick, a little tough to get through but all well worth it!
Different flavors for all the seafood thats bagged up just how you like it!
Crowed and cool to mingle and socialize!
Will definitely go back soon!"}
{"text":"If your a seafood lover this is the place to go! There's not many seafood places in AZ. One of a kind. I highly recommend this place you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Got in before the rush. The suggestions given to us as first timers were great. Good food and look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Nothing beats their a cold beer and some spicy shrimp. Staff is always friendly and fast, even when its busy, which seems to be most of the time."}
{"text":"This place has a deliciously novel way of dishing up some old favorites. The crab legs are large and meaty, the seasoning is unparalleled. You will be licking the table! 
The catfish was lightly breaded, flaky, and tasted sublime (in my group of 6, including 2 in their 70s, every one of us agreed: the best any of us had ever tasted)  

The raw oysters are served the traditional way, and are very fresh.

I haven't had the blue crab, but the people I know who've had it laud the freshness and sweet taste.

The Angry Crab is a welcome addition to the list of East Valley's restaurant options."}
{"text":"This was our first time there. We loved the place! It is a different concept, nice atmosphere, very friendly service and GREAT food!"}
{"text":"When we walked in I felt like I was on vacation at a restaurant next to the ocean.  Very fun, loud atmosphere.  My BF and I came in after a quick yelp search of nearby restaurants an once again were not disappointed!  We were surprised to be seated immediately because the parking lot was pretty packed.  
Our friendly waitress explained everything and brought out bibs and things to crack crab.  The table is covered in paper which is good cause it's definitely a messy meal!  We ordered the hush puppies as an app and they were tasty.  He ordered the king crab and I ordered the shrimp.  We paid $2 more to have their heads removed.  Well worth it as I don't like my food looking at me before I devour it.  We got a bag of veggies to share. The veggies were good but we weren't too sure about the pumpkin that was in it.  It was a ton of food.  We both ordered the trifecta sauce #1 heat and that was spicy enough for us wimps.  It had a delicious flavor.  I couldn't eat all my shrimp but my BF was able to finish it after he ate his crab.  
We had a fun and tasty experience and will definitely be back.
My only recommendation for the restaurant would be to give out wet naps at the end for those of us who choose to dig in and not wear gloves!"}
{"text":"For a seafood lover living in AZ it completely sucks that we have very limited options for GOOD seafood. VERY Limited. I'm beyond ecstatic that i have found this place!!! We drove all the way from west valley and totally worth every gas mileage we racked up! The service was good once they finally served us though that took some time due to communication issues with the hostess.  But forget about all that cause I'm sure you really just want to know about the food. We ordered Dungeness crab in trifecta hot: ridiculously awesome! Lobster in trifecta mild: she wasn't speaking due to lobster being stuffed in mouth so I would also say very good. We ordered sausage and corn with them and they were also delicious. Crawfish in trifecta hot was also great but I believe the crab trumped that. The Cajun fries were seasoned perfectly and highly addictive. The fried cod according to my husband was good although I'm docking points for giving us a partially raw one (they corrected it and sent us new batch FYI). So overall can you really go wrong with crabs and beer especially when you put it those crazy good sauces?!?!! Run to this place it was great. Oh and ambiance is also exactly what I want a crab shack to be as it lends for a very easy time to get down and dirty and suck the heck out of those suckers down!"}
{"text":"Good place to get your seafood fix in Phoenix. If you like crab boils, they have snow, king and blue to choose from and a number of seasoning options. I ordered snow crab with butter and garlic and it was flavorful and quality crab. The fried oysters were fresh and good sized. They come with cocktail sauce (which is not my preference). I asked for tartar sauce and it tasted like the ranch dressing with old bay seasoning (not my favorite). The side of beans were flavorful, a little sweet and a little tang with a thick sauce (how I like it!). The potato salad was a huge miss. It had the old bay type seasoning mixed into it. It's hard to mess up a potato salad, but they managed to do it!

Service was friendly and quick. They refilled our drinks and came by to check on us regularly.

We were there on a Friday, and the place was packed, and the noise level is pretty high. 

I like having this seafood option in Phoenix. Prices are reasonable, too!"}
{"text":"I grew up in the Gulf Coast. Seafood was a way of life. Since moving to the AZ, lack of fresh seafood has been a big problem. PROBLEM SOLVED! The guys at the Angry Crab pride themselves on always sourcing fresh product. Example: the Dungeness crab is forced to crawl its way into the pot. But seriously, for the price you are paying, it is good to know you're getting live seafood. 

The menu set-up is simple. Half the menu consists of the boil-in-bag fresh seafood. Half the menu is the fried seafood and sides. Both sides of the menu are great, but I keep coming back for the seasoned boiled seafood. I order their trifecta sauce, and pick a heat level that matches my mojo (usually two or three, four is crazy hot). 

The staff is very friendly. They are passionate about their business, which I think is related to this being a family business instead of a bullshit corporate restaurant. This place will always count on me as a customer so long as this doesn't change."}
{"text":"Yesssssss. Finally had time to stop in for a meal. I'm not sure when the busy hours are but Sunday lunch is a pretty good time to slide through here. We were seated quickly and the hostess was very nice. Our waitress came over an took our drink orders almost immediately. The menu has a great selection. I recommend the shrimp with trifecta sauce, angry wings with trifecta sauce medium, the calamari was crispy and had a good amount, the mussels were good with the Cajun sauce, and the snow crab was awesome. I really enjoyed my experience today,  I definitely recommend this place. Cant wait until my next visit."}
{"text":"Wonderfully tasty seafood, very casual. Good selection of food. Crab, shrimp, even sandwiches came in several preparations. Best seafood at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great food, waitstaff. Looking forward to my next visit. Several restaurants around the valley, seems like they have a good rep."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for lunch on Tuesday. I had noticed the restaurant as we were driving by a few weeks ago and once I checked out the reviews I couldn't wait to try it. I'm originally from the east coast and am quite used to having great seafood at any time. Since I've been in Arizona (13 years) I've been searching for my spot of heaven here. I found it! We had the king crab legs and the shrimp. King crab legs served in the garlic sauce and the shrimp in the trifecta sauce - medium. DELICIOUS! Very fresh tasting. Served piping hot and exactly as ordered. My boyfriend was a bit skeptical so he ordered a buffalo chicken po' boy wrap for his first meal. He quickly not only began helping me eat the seafood, but was dipping his wrap in the garlic sauce from the crab legs!

The service was fantastic. Very fast and the servers are very friendly. I'm already going to go back on Sunday and introduce my son to the place!

I can't wait for the blue crabs to arrive. That's what I am really missing and I am sure Angry Crab Shack won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Man, I had heard about this place and being in Phoenix, I was skeptical about getting good seafood (originally from the east coast). This place is a breath of fresh air! The total opposite of garbage like Red Lobster. The King Crab legs in the Trifecta sauce (medium spice) was delicious. Seriously, delicious. The medium spice had a pretty good bite to it. The shrimp in the Trifecta sauce is also amazing. Ordered corn on the cob as well, and it was nice that it wasn't soggy. I also recommend getting the sausage with your order. It's great with the Trifecta sauce.

Love the eat with your fingers thing they have going on. Just make sure you have plenty of napkins at your table. Very cool that they have hand washing stations as well.

The prices I think are not too bad. You will pay market prices for the crab legs, but all in all with a few drinks, it was very reasonable.

Can't wait to go back! They are only open at 3pm right now and don't do take out, but they say this will be changing in the near future."}
{"text":"We had lunch there today.  Shrimp boil was great.  We also had the 3 meat BBQ item.  It is a bit pricey but good for what you get.  Service fine.  Very  nice experience and plan to be back. Thought it was 5 star."}
{"text":"Better than hot and juicy lets start there. Although we had to wait awhile to be seated we recieved great service and food. The waiter was very patient with the large group of folks I came with. We didnt try the BBQ but the seafood everyone ordered was tasty and fresh. Will be back."}
{"text":"Must be willing to \"get into\" your food.  No utensils at this place.  Loved the  uniqueness of the place but the food is just ok.  Food was a bit soggy and overcooked."}
{"text":"This place rocks. Great food and great service. We stop on a Saturday night and it was an 2 hr wait. We passed on it that night but came next Saturday for lunch and we got sat right a way.

Ps. Great food"}
{"text":"I just had the best dozen oysters that I've had in many many years!  And what really surprises me it was
 not in new oreleans not on the East Coast 
or the West Coast but Phoenix!!!
They were plump, sweet and perfectly chilled, they were to die for.

Also had an order of fried oysters and frog legs.  Breading was a cornmeal, not my usual flour dusting, but still good.  

Service was excellent by the very friendly staff.  I will definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"I don't think the raves on this place match anything I experienced.  The wait staff was confused and it took forever to get an order in.  They were out of everything I wanted to eat.  I settled for raw oysters and the staff didn't know how to explain the catch.  They were creamy.  I don't prefer creamy raw.  So then I ordered the calamari and it was tasteless. The cocktail sauce tasted like ketchup. The tarter sauce it came with was so weird I got scared and asked if it was rancid.    They checked and said it had a ton of pickle in it it.  Ick.. It's expensive too. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on Fat Tuesday.  Ordered their outstanding gumbo to start, nicely seasoned with a slight kick and good variety of seafood and meats. For the main entrees we ordered the seasoned and corn-meal breaded catfish basket with fries and coleslaw.  The fish was nice and hot, lightly coated in corn-meal and had a fresh and moist texture while still feeling light and airy.  Couldn't have been done better. The chipotle mayo sauce on the side complemented nicely.  Fries were well seasoned and also hot and fresh out of the fryer.  Perfectly cooked with just the right amount of crisp outside to fluffy inside. Coleslaw was simply dressed and extremely fresh; tasted like it was make within the hour.  My partner ordered the soft-shelled crab baguette with fries and coleslaw.  He found the crab, seasoning and layers of lettuce, pickles and mayo very tasty but found the bread to be untoasted and cold.  We talked to the waiter and instead of transferring the crab to a toasted baguette, the replaced the entire sandwich and it was exceptional.  Our server was prompt, very helpful when ordering, checked on us often, and had a really warm and pleasant personality which really added to our dining experience.  My only negative is that the interior feels a little dark and cold and not nearly as welcoming as the food and service.  However, go for the latter as you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been a regular at Joe's Crab Shack for years.  Last night I tried Angry Crab Shack for the first time, and I'm a convert.  The atmosphere was casual and laid back, the drinks were tasty, and the crab was delish.  And, I received absolutely fantastic service from Evan!"}
{"text":"excellent food and good service. Best crab I have had in Arizona. Only negative is they do not have Tabasco for the oysters and they do not serve Anchor Steam at the Bar. otherwise, you will not find better crab in Arizona."}
{"text":"Not the best, but not the worst. Not much to say except l do appreciate the presence of another restaurant in Goodyear. The fried food is a bit overcooked,and not fresh, but what can you expect ...were in a desert. The atmosphere is a bar atmosphere, loud and very loud. Customer service is not bad, but can't see past everything else. Average overall..."}
{"text":"No joke.  Best crab and sausage I have had.  Will be sending all my friends!  Everyone is so nice and willing to help you or just talk to you.  They are genuinely having a good time working there.  If you're lucky maybe you can get a chance to talk to Daniel.  He is a foodie and loves to talk about his passion.  This place friggin rocks!"}
{"text":"Always fabulous! I can't resist the king crab with the trifecta, totally amazingly! And the mussels with the pacific rim is also ridiculously good. We always start with some hush puppies, they are little balls of flavor! They have so many choices of spices and levels of heat that every time I go it is a different flavor adventure! And I go almost once a week! I am always full and never disappointed. Love this place (obviously)!"}
{"text":"Use to love it!!!! I was craving it and I went in my last experience wasn't great but I thought I would give it another try. So disappointing. I use to work at the place that's how much I loved their food. The place has completely gone down hill since the last time I was there... The food use to be amazing I took my mom and her friend there, I had been raving about it. As such a unique place. Having worked there at one time I felt I had an edge on what was good but I was very disappointed. It wasn't just me who was disappointed my mom and her friend were also let down by their meal we ordered my old favorites: snow crab traditional boil 2 with sausage, potatoes, and corn. The crab was way over cooked and I don't think they put any spice in it maybe they have gotten too many complaints on the spice level but I was looking forward to not feeling my lips. Then there was the fried shrimp and Cajun fries. The shrimp tasted like rubber and the fries tasted like they were cooked 3 hours earlier. Then there was the mac n Cheese my once favorite.... it was luke warm and Missing the signature jalopeno. I never give bad reviews but I was really disappointed in the food quality. What happened this place use to be so amazing."}
{"text":"We had a very nice birthday meal - Taylor was a great server. Very quick and polite. Thank you."}
{"text":"The food was YACK. Way over priced, and flavorless. The shrimp was served with head, eyeballs, and legs. We ordered shrimp, crab, AND lobster. So that's a little variety. I'm giving this one star because our waitress was great and the crab was sweet. Still, that wasn't enough to save us from the constant pooper scooping and flavorless food. Granted, we got it \"wimpy\" as it was our first time here and had no idea if we could handle any spice. Regardless, when the server brought a different sauce, it just didn't save anything. Eat at Joe's!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty amazing! Love the food and the prices were decent for what you are getting."}
{"text":"Such fun restaurant to go with a group of people. They have local beers on tap and the service staff have a fun almost chill service approach. Just a enjoyable laid back joint with some good seafood and a casual environment. I can't stress how casual it is, be prepared to wear a bib if you will be cracking crabs and eating with your hands! :)"}
{"text":"Sloppy, spring-break/Sturgis loud, a bit overpriced but super tasty. Im not a big fan but didn't hate it either. If you like your entire table swimming in your meal and wearing as much of the food as eating it, then saddle up brother! You've found your backwater seafood nirvana :-)"}
{"text":"I am addicted to this place! Damn! So so so good.  My friends and I crave this place.  The shrimp in the trifecta, the crab, the corn, the sausage-all finger licking good!! YOU MUST TRY THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"yuuuummy! I am addicted to this place.  Get the trifecta mild crab legs and mussels! I don't get the shrimp because they don't devein them = /  
As far as their sides, the coleslaw, beans, and potato salads really suck.  The cajun fries and hushpuppies are good!"}
{"text":"We had a small problem with a take out order.  We called and spoke with the manager CAT.  She was very sweet and apologetic and invited us back for a second chance.  She laid out the red carpet and proved that this is the premier place to get cajon seafood in the West Valley.  This is a must attend restaurant."}
{"text":"Another solid eating experience at the angry crab!  I was craving some good spicy seafood and this place hit the spot.  I took my lady here on a Saturday night.  It was pretty busy but only needed to wait 10 minutes for a table.  The service was great, our waiter checked up on us a lot, which was great, but I'm sure every time he came, he saw me smash the crab legs that I ordered!  I don't play around at this place.  The service was awesome.  We ordered some hush puppies and cajun fries.  Also 2 lbs of crab legs, 2 lbs of mussels and 1 lb of shrimp!  This time I ordered the trifecta but only level 2 spice!  Once again another solid meal.  I give it 5 stars!  The place is loud, its messy, but its good ole eating.  My type of style.  I would gladly drop 100 or so on this place, then some BS FOX concept restaurants. (Arrogant Butcher)"}
{"text":"We love the delicious eats at Angry Crab! The steamed seafood is served hot, fresh and with impressive efficiency. They carry a strong selection of local beers to complete your dining experience. We love the Pacific Rim and Trifecta flavors. Great for a casual celebration with friends. Ask for gloves and bibs if you're a neat-freak like me."}
{"text":"I wanted to visit this place for a couple years (after I read a great review in the paper) but I don't live close to the Mesa even when I'm in AZ  from a cold and distant land. So I was happy to hear an ACS opened on Ray Rd.  My Ahwahtukee sister and I happened in last Saturday. We were greeted by a friendly face immediately and chose to sit at the bar for a cocktail and appetizer. The limited alcohol selection (to me) did not stop our fabulous bartender Jeff from figuring out our taste preferences and mixing up quite a delicious cocktail served in a mason jar. Jeff showed us the bottles of Ted's Vodkas and pointed out that this blend uses only natural ingredients to flavor its vodka. Quality is found in the details. 
On to the appetizer. Since we were newbies to the procedure, Jeff again took his time to question us about our desires. Because the appetizers were fried, we decided on a pound of boiled shrimp with a side of Cajun fries. Excellent choice! Easy enough system; 1st choose the seafood, 2nd choose the sauce (tribeca) and 3rd choose the spice level (= heat index). My sis isn't a huge fan of hot and spicy food so we got level 1. No heat to cloud the flavor of the shrimp. Although I will get a hotter level next visit I must also say the shrimp was EXCELLENT and cooked to perfection. I cannot stress the perfection part enough. Tender as young love. And having read reviews before visiting I knew that  the meal could be messy but couldn't care less when I was enjoying our meal so fully. Jeff checked on us often and suggested another sauce to try, the curry coconut sauce. You bet, bring it on Jeff.  Well, I've been around quite a number of years and eaten a whole lot of a variety of foods and flavors. So when I am introduced to a new taste sensation I am thrilled. By now you may have guessed it, ecstatic! I was fully in the throes of a flavor extravaganza. Just so very good. 
Lessons learned: Go back to this Angry Crab Shack. Let Jeff be your guide ( or Mike who trained Jeff) and enjoy the whole experience =)"}
{"text":"We met a big group of friends at Angry Crab recently for dinner, and it was great.  We shared the three meat Pit Master platter with pulled pork, brisket, and chicken.  The meats were succulent, tender, and mighty tasty!  We also shared a pound each of the shrimp, salmon, crawfish, lobster, and vegetables.

The service was wonderful, too.

We definitely will come back to Angry Crab."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the 4 & 5 star ratings. This was my first visit, and everything was right on. The server made recommendations that turned out to be very good. I ordered both raw and chard oysters, very tasty. My wife ordered the blue crab boil and was very happy with the selection. I had the crawfish roll, now I am not a big crawfish fan but the waiter  recommended it, so I gave it a shot, not bad. Well ok, I was there for oysters and found a new place for crab. We will be back."}
{"text":"So fun!! The kids loved it and our server was amazing and showed us \"trick\"  to get the crab out of King crab legs. Fun experience and great food!"}
{"text":"The food is fine, but you kind of eat with your hands. Since I am not a fan of that, I chose a soft shell crab po-boy. I enjoyed it, and the service was fine. One problem. I not only had been overcharged this visit, I was overcharged the last visit. Which I discovered after he ran my card. He offered me a coupon to get $2.00 off any well drink. 
Hard to resist that, eh? 
How about a refund?
Besides why offer me a well drink? Each time I was there, I ordered \"not\" a well drink.

I never went back."}
{"text":"Went here the other day and had the BEST crab legs seasoned in a bag & the BEST server, Shelby, who made the whole experience complete. It's hard to find great customer service now a days but this place you can tell loves their customers. I will be back soon"}
{"text":"I love angry crab......there food is the best..bets out red lobster and there cheaper. And you get so much food.wow love it and if you try there extremely hot trifecta the waiter yells out SOMEBODY Likes it HOT!!!!!!!! Cracks me up every time. Best place for seafood."}
{"text":"This place a joke. If you've had Pappadeux or HotNJuicy this place is no comparison. NO TASTE, and don't even serve lemon or Tabasco."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best seafood! Our favorite dish is the Cajun Shrimp. Get extra sauce on the side to dip too! The layout and design of this restaurant is super creative, i like how customers write stuff on the walls. Services are always GREAT!!!"}
{"text":"The raw oysters and fresh crawfish were incredible. Mixed with the refreshing nice IPA life doesn't get any better. Like the crawfish when I lived in Louisiana. 

Nate, my server, was not only helpful but knowledgeable.

F"}
{"text":"Having read rave reviews about the Mesa location, I eagerly awaited coming to this one when it opened.  But now having tried it twice, I'd not go back.  My dining companion concurred. 

The food is adequate, but it's the \"experience\" that is bizarre.  First, our service was pretty bad. The waitress did come to \"apologize profusely\" at the end fo the meal to ensure she was well tipped, but she was MIA during the meal. We flagged down whomever wandered by.

Second, the noise level was so over-the-top, conversation was impossible.  But if one doesn't mind not conversing, that can be overlooked too.

The troubling part of the meal is having to put your paws, along with your dining companions so hope they've not just picked their noses or don't have the flu, in a big plastic bag.  At the bottom of the bag is the sauce and your food.

We asked and tacky styrofoam plates and the cheapest of plastic cutlery was brought so we didn't have to eat our coleslaw with our fingers,,,apparently the plan....and had a place to lay down our crab.  

I understand takeout in plastic bags, but really, can't they bring the food in a bowl or on a tray, which is how one usually is served this kind of food at myriad restaurants around the country.  Too unsanitary for me.  Not to mention the sauce IS IN THE bottom of the bag.  I'd rather have it on my food I'm eating or be able to dunk the seafood in it.

Despite showers and numerous hand-washing, the stench of the seafood sauce didn't disappear for days.  I don't mind eating with my hands, and in fact, did for a year living in India.  But it's the community bag of food to paw through that is just plain weird and unappealing.

The shrimp was only so-so, the crab was good, and the sides of hush puppies and coleslaw were average.  Unless they change the serving method, we'll not go back. 

On my first trip b/c alone, i tried a p'oor boy sandwich, having had wonderful ones at other restaurants.  This one was dry with a bland sauce. Ordering a spicier sauce (for which I was charged extra), it improved the taste, but still not of a caliber that I'd eat it again.  I decided to return with friends where we could try the seafood by the pound cuisine.  

Plastic bags for takeout is fine, but not for dining in!  At $20 per pound, it would seem they could serve the food on a tray or a serving bowl with a serving spoon."}
{"text":"What they have going on here is amazing!!! Great food, great vibe, so much fun.  How many places do you get to eat with your hands?  Visited for the weekend and ended up eating here every night it was so good.  

Beware, the spice gets really hot after 2 on their scale!"}
{"text":"We love this place. We've taken a couple of other couples here now. The flavors are always fantastic. We've had a couple instances where the snow crab or shrimp were slightly over cooked, but still very tasty and always a great time. I highly recommend the trifecta on the boil and ALWAYS get the sausage. If they gave me a bag full of the sausages steeped in the trifecta, I'd be a happy camper. Don't get me wrong the crab is still amazing. My wife likes the grapefruit mule and always gets a glass with dinner. Don't expect silverware. Wear the bib! Prepare to get VERY messy and just have a great time!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks were great.  Be careful, it's messy!  I ate the shrimp with the pacific sauce and my finger nails are still yellow a day later.  Add sausage, corn, and bread.  So good with the sauce!"}
{"text":"Best Angry Crab Shack location of them all! Seriously delicious and never a wait! Love this place. We are addicted!"}
{"text":"As much as I LOVE this place, (I visit a least once a month and it's 25 miles out of the way) I can't give it more than 4 stars. The trifecta sauce is the only way to have it! Absolutely deliciousness! It's messy, fun, and yummy! There is always a decent crowd, so if you go on the weekend, expect a wait. I try to visit during the evenings during the week. The reason for the 4 stars is the menu is limited, the fried menu is \"ok,\" the rice is a little hard...I've ordered rice several times here and it's never done right. They should add some crab dip, crab cakes, or crab chowder to the menu. Seafood is rare in AZ, so it would be an absolute hit! This place will always be a favorite of mine!"}
{"text":"Yum. My. Such a fun atmosphere, oh, and the food is amazing, too. We ordered a lb of king crab and a lb of shrimp. Both in the Trifecta seasoning in \"medium\" heat. The crab was so good, sweet and tender, the best I've had. The shrimp was great, not over cooked at all. I will say, the medium was pretty damn hot, and that's coming from 2 native Arizonans who are used to heat. Be careful with the heat. Overall, a great experience, we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This was terrible, I have to the Angry Crab several times and yesterday was a disaster.  The staff seemed more concerned with dating each other and finding out plans than service.  One waitress had her child there several staff members picked up the 20 month child carried her around, wiped her face with there hands and then continued to serve, holding her and holding her little feet in tennis shoes while she had been walking all over the place and then bringing your food.  The shrimp was old and over cooked extremely mushy told our waiter who had been so busy talking with a group of staff member at the baby table he forgot to give us our shrimp and I watched it sit on the railing for over 5 minutes and finally someone else checked to see were it went and brought it to us.   When I told the waiter about the consistency of the shrimp the Waiter just said sometimes shrimp are like that - really!"}
{"text":"I can't comment as to the quality of the food, but I can say the customer service thoroughly sucks.  We traveled 30 minutes out of our way to eat here, and when we walked in the door we were rudely told that they were closed... at 6pm on a Tuesday night.  We had checked Google, Yelp, and their website before leaving the house and not one place mentioned an early closure.  If you are going to close early, you should absolutely make mention of it at the very least on your website.  Not cool."}
{"text":"My husband and I went last night for the first time and we were shocked! As a bartender in the neighborhood, I couldn't believe I had never heard of this place! Everything was FAR from perfect, but being in the industry I know things happen.... Candice, our server, and the male manager did what I wish every place did under the circumstances to make us happy! Thanks guys!
   We arrived at 7:30 on Sunday and it was PACKED! There wasn't even space to grab a drink at the bar while we waited the 30 we were quoted (they text when your table is ready- how refreshing for us youngsters!) so we walked across the parking lot to another restaurant for a quick drink. We were texted at 7:40, so we rushed back over. I know that would bother a lot of people, but the restaurant cannot help when tables decide to leave, and I was super excited to try this place! We were seated in a booth with a view of the entire dining room- perfect for people watching! Candice said hi and that she'd be with us shortly immediately after we sat. This is huge to me as a bartender- I am constantly amazed at how rarely we get this tiny gesture at bars and restaurants!
   Candice was BUSY but she handled it like a champ and gave us the lowdown and answered our questions. I ordered king crab and my husband ordered the bbq combo... this is where things could have taken a turn... Candice came back and informed us they ran out of brisket. No biggie, there's a few other meats to make up for it. A couple minutes later the nice male manager came and told me they ran out of KING CRAB! Oh nooo! This was the only crab joint of it's kind, and it's all I wanted for my birthday (they didn't know this because I avoid embarrassment at all costs)! The manager and our server were professional, apologetic, upbeat and had every intention of making us happy. They did. 
   I had the snow crab instead, which was perfect and messy and what I wanted all along, I just didn't know it, and the bbq was beyond our expectations. The mac and cheese was delish, so were the sausage, potatoes and fries. We are pretty easy going, but I thought for sure I was going to be disappointed and not want to come back... Nope.
   I have never been treated better by a restaurant and we eat out many times a week. We usually get stereotyped as young, tatooed and probably cheap/poor, etc and not treated great. But here, with an eclectic looking staff, we were always a priority and were checked on often and chatted up by staff. What an AWESOME place!
  The icing on the red velvet cheesecake was that when we got our bill it had been adjusted properly and a couple things were comped for us. Most places do not do this anymore and that's unfortunate. We will absolutely be back again and again. My new favorite spot!!!"}
{"text":"We loved the one in Mesa and finally made it out to this one. Was so disappointed in the quality of the seafood here. We got the shrimp and snow crab with the trifecta seasoning in medium heat. Came out with the wrong spice level (mild). So they brought us out a side of the correct one (and charged us for it). The shrimp and snowcrab did not taste sweet at all. Flavorless. It's like the boiled it in water first and then just threw it in the bag with the (wrong) seasoning. The fried cod was crisp on the outside but the fish was dry and the inside of the batter tasted gooey/mushy. The calamari strips and fried oysters were pretty tasty. The kids loved the Cajun fries. The waiter was friendly. Won't be coming back to this one. A disappointing visit for sure."}
{"text":"Love this place! The trifecta sauce at a heat level 2 is perfection. I like that the shrimp still have the head on. A pound will fill me up and its only $12! The Cajun fries are really good too.
The space is very large and there are some TVs. Be prepared to get messy, its finger lickin good!
Haven't tried the BBQ yet, but i plan to soon..."}
{"text":"Another of our all time favorites! My husband and I LOVE seafood, and it really does NOT get better than this! The seafood is always fresh and tasty, and I love all the choices in how to flavor your seafood. They also have more kids of seafood than most places. I also love that I can buy a pound or two of my favorite seafood, and leave out all of the distractors! You can have them throw in potatoes, corn on the cob, sausages, or nothing at all. Sometimes I just want to have a whole lot of crab legs and nothing else, or sometimes I want all the fixins, and I can have it either way. You only pay for what you ask for, and not silly things like biscuits and salads, or piles of rice pilaf whether you want them or not. And because they leave off the froo froo, the prices are outstanding for what you get! LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Went to this place before Christmas and we ordered a couple lbs of shrimp and crawfish. We are a regular at their angry crab Mesa location and expect the same taste with the tri-fecta sauce, but it was disappointing to say the least, there wasn't enough garlic or any butter in the sauce, it tasted like water. It basically tasted like watered sauce steam shrimp. We asked the server how come it taste nothing like the taste we had at their Mesa location, they said maybe the cook kinda messed up the sauce recipe. I understand this location just opened and there are many things to work out but surely their trifecta (most popular) sauce need some serious work at this location. Friendly servers and the pacific rim sauce was good though."}
{"text":"First time my family and I ate here. The atmosphere is loud when you walk in but very inviting. I ordered the dungeness crab at 18 per lb. The dish was so delicious. It was soaked in butter, lemon, and Cajun spices. Absolute heaven. I got the potato, sausages, and corn. All served to you in a bag with the crab. By the time I got to my corn, it soaked up all the juices from the crab. Big thumbs up to the chef! If your a seafood lover and not afraid to get your hands dirty this is the place for you. I will be back :p Delicious food!"}
{"text":"This was no Boiling Crab, but it came pretty close! 

Our waitress was extremely nice. She made sure our table was well taken care of and that our drinks were always filled. The ambiance of the place was very casual and comfortable. It was a very clean place where I felt comfortable enough to roll up my sleeves and dig in with my hands! They have two sinks located outside of their restrooms which made it even more convenient.  We didn't have to stand in long bathroom lines. 

The food was very good. The sauce was excellent, but could have used some more garlic. I ordered a pound of shrimp in the trifecta sauce with corn and cornbread on the side. The cornbread was very moist and delicious. My friends ordered Cajun fries which were made very well with the right amount of seasoning. The shrimp didn't taste very fresh, but what could they have done...? We live in Arizona, not the coast!"}
{"text":"Fantastic crab.  Love the trifecta simmer.  Also enjoy the shrimp po boy if not up for the crab.  If you order the crab, they will bring out food as it is ready, so be prepared for that.  Delicious and favorite spot for crab."}
{"text":"I will definitely go back again.  This place is a bit pricey but not ridiculous.   We had 2 dungeness crabs and 4 blue crabs here.  The staff told us that those crabs were live before cooked.  I am a big seafood fan and I often buy live seafood and cook it myself, so I can attest the freshness on those crabs.  There was one blue crab that didn't taste like it was live before cooked but it's still fresh enough for us to enjoy it.  

On the other hand, their raw oysters and grilled oysters, are only okay.  The oysters we had are likely to be pre-frozen.  Not extremely fresh like the crabs, but still fresh enough not to cause any health issues.  Also, those crabs are boiled and they don't offer the steaming option.  You just can't get the best out of those crabs without steaming okay?  So that's why I give it a 4-star rating instead of a 5."}
{"text":"I have visited this particular location for several times and pretty satisfied overall.

Shrimp - Always good, not the best but at least it's fresh enough for cooked shrimps.  FYI - shrimps may come with the head for those who are afraid of shrimp with head-on.

Raw oyster - Angry crab usually doesn't offer multiple selections of oysters.  I wouldn't recommend the grilled oysters here, they just don't do it right, but their raw oyster is ALWAYS fresh, and they haven't failed even once!  I am impressed because not every seafood restaurant can keep up the freshness standard on raw oyster.

Clams - Hit and miss.  I will be nice and post a \"fresh clams\" photo here but once a while you will get those \"out-of-date\" clams in the bag.  I got the bad ones from Angry Treasure Special but I am not sure if that's the reason.

Snow crabs - Fresher than the ones from buffet that's for sure.

This place also have great selections of beers and the service is always superb."}
{"text":"The concept is good, but the experience wasn't the best. They really promote certain things, such as a big selection of local beers on tap. The first three I requested were not available. They also seemed to be out of other main menu items. The table next to us ordered king crab only to find out they were sold out. We were told they were out of blue crab. 

The food was good. I enjoyed dipping my food in the sauce in the bag. I ordered a one for spice, which was probably the right amount. I like some spice, but not something that lingers. My husband ordered a 3 which was about right for him; he loves spicy. I got the trifecta sauce and I could definitely taste the distinct flavors. I do wish they had been a little bit more prepared to hand out silverware. They seem to pride themselves on no utensils but a fork would have gone a long way in helping extract crab from the shell. 

We told them it was my birthday and they did a little announcement and gave me a free piece of cheesecake. It was a fun experience and I'd go back, but maybe see if a different location has more of the menu items in stock."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh this place is awesome!!!! We came on a Monday night and they had a special going with a boil bag mix with crawfish, shrimp, and mussels. We got the traditional seasoning that was a bit spicy for my taste but still very yummy. I will probably go down a spice next time. We also got the dungeons crab and hush puppies.

Service...
Our server was very nice and knowledgable of the menu but you could tell she was off her game. Our food did not come out all at the same time, she said that chicken just takes \"forever\" in general...it's chicken strips...and if that is the case she should have waited to put in the boil bags so that my friend didn't have to sit with no food. We were also assuming the hush puppies we ordered would come out more as an appetizer, but we didn't ask so that was our fault.

Towards the end my brother ordered a beer...our server was very busy so it was taking a while which was fine we could see her running around. About 5-7 minutes later she tells us that the keg was out and they were changing it. We told her never mind because we were done eating and got the bill. During the meal the manager stopped by prior the chicken strips coming and we told her we were missing that and the hush puppies...she comped those off our bill. 

Everyone was very friendly and the food was delicious. We will definitely be back, I just hope they figure out the timing of food :)"}
{"text":"Got some alligator bites,  crab,  and shrimp.  Absolutely amazing customer service and such a fun place.  Made some new friends here and my wife who is normally very picky ate as much as I did.  Could easily eat here everyday!!"}
{"text":"This place was great in the early going because it was fresh and new. The manager claimed that the seafood was FedEx'd dryice overnight from various locations , hence the freshness of the primarily boiled seafood menu.
The tablecloths are all paper and changed after each customer leaves,paper towels for napkins and wet wipes due to the messy smelly nature of seafood that is peel and eat.
The last couple of times the lines have been too long and the place felt too rushed, like they wanted you in and out quickly.....I get it ..you trying to get as many clients served as possible...but I can't eat any dang faster!!!!!!   The peel and eat shrimp were awesome the first 3 times, but the last 3 they have been downright greasy.. They serve them piping hot in plastic bags, so newbies BEWARE, you might burn your little fingertips!
I personally make better shrimp, but of course they are for ME...
The gumbo is DELISH!  I am from the Nawlins area so I can appreciate what they are trying to do...but they got a long way to go before they reach Zydeco level.
3 stars for this joint"}
{"text":"Not too bad for a greasy cajun joint.
The Mesa location is overcrowded at times, so this one is easier to stomach ( no pun intented)
I love the Gumbo in its fatty salty decadence...definitely New Orleans style.
The prices are fair, and the seafood is supposedly flown in overnight per the Manager.
If you like Cajun, boil in the bag and don't mind wearing a bib to eat and peel your own,then this place is for you.
personally I'd rather cook at home...but..sometimes this is much easier.

{"text":"We had an amazing time at dinner tonight. Customer service was on point- shout out to our waitress Cat! She made our experience 10 times better, she brought great  energy to the table and created a home style environment. The food was delicious! 


Went back to celebrate my husbands birthday on June 14th, total of 17 of us. We had the pleasure of having Val as our server. She was absolutely AMAZING!! Her customer service was on point and she helped make the night a great experience for us all. I give her much praise and kudos for handling a large party without missing a best. Thanks for everything Val!"}
{"text":"favorite place ever! ANDREA is a great server! very attentive and a pleasure to be around!"}
{"text":"I love Angry Crab Shack.They have the best shrimp and snow crab:) The service is the best and the workers are really friendly!!!!!! I would recommend this place for people who love seafood. You can get really messy when you eat the food,so they give you cute crab bibs."}
{"text":"Excellent place to get your seafood fix in the desert. I went with the dungeness crab with corn and a potato, oysters, and cajun fries. First came the oysters, which were plump and fresh, much better than what you typically get in AZ for a similar price, e.g. Casey Moore's or Baja Joes.  Next were the cajun fries, which came out piping hot and crispy. I had to make an effort to stop eating them to save room for the main course. 

The dungeness crab comes out whole, and will weigh more than 1lb, but my server kindly warned me of this and it wasn't a problem. When I opened the bag I looked like the crab was nibbling on my corn (see pic).

My only qualm came with the price of dungeness crab being $1.25 more per lb than on the menu. I understand re-printing all the inserts for the tables is annoying, but the price was even wrong on the marker-board. I couldn't care less about the extra couple bucks, and I would have ordered it at either price, it just comes off as a bit sloppy when prices don't match up. The food was too good to take a star off for that thought so I'm sticking with the 5 stars

This place is a great time and I will definitely be back. They were in the process of building a bar and I intend to use it!"}
{"text":"Food was great,service was great! I think it may be a little overpriced,but being from the Chicagoland area,Our \"market price\" may be lower."}
{"text":"We loved this place. Spicy bloody and decent prices. Be prepared to get messy. It's a fun place to go for date night. We both got seafood in a bag and it was delicious. I was stuffed. The waitress was awesome and very friendly. 5 stars."}
{"text":"The food tasted great but I really don't understand why everyone is great craving to go here.  I think it's a bit overpriced for what you get.  I think they probably survive on it being a fad you go once and then you're done."}
{"text":"Get the king crab boil. The best seafood I've ever had in Arizona! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is where dreams come true.  The seafood is oh so delicious.  Mmmmm... we had the snow crabs and shrimp with the hot trifecta sauce... and it was magical.  The corn was cooked in the sauce, so it was awesome.  The sides are good too, I live the corn bread, it's sweet and moist - almost like a bread pudding.  The raw oysters are awesome!  Absolutely perfect!  We'll be back every chance we get."}
{"text":"I had the fried cod with fries and bbq beans with a side of hush puppies. Very good.
Kathi had the shrimp boil with red potatoes.  Very good. Matt, our server did a good job . 
Looking forwatd to trying the BBQ."}
{"text":"Excellent catfish. Service was great. Drinks were strong and tasty. Laid back atmosphere. Highly recommend for your seafood cravings."}
{"text":"Love the Angry Crab!!! Ok, so one doesn't normally associate Arizona with seafood! But! This place has such a fun atmosphere: always busy/crowded, good amount of noise and of course, delicious food! And the prices, especially for seafood, are quite reasonable. I tend to go with at least a pound of crab legs with the trifecta sauce and I usually pair that with a mound of muscles with the same sauce. It's a blast going with friends, sharing a meal and laughing over breaking your food open on the table! The only downside is that there is always a long wait--but it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for seafood. Never disappointed and the service is great.  Staff is very friendly.  Wish the crawfish season was longer"}
{"text":"Tonight was my second time eating at Angry Crab Shack and Evan was my waiter. He totally made the experience of eating here AMAZING! He was super friendly and helpful, giving recommendations and suggestions as to what we would like the best. He was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. He even played along with my family's craziness and jokes. 10/10 would recommend Evan and even the crab too!"}
{"text":"It's a shame I can't leave multiple reviews, they would be 5 stars all day. My girlfriend and I go about twice a week, we're addicted to the place.

Angry Crab is my favorite place to go and eat. If you're not covered in Trifecta sauce then you're not doing it right. Hands down the best shrimp, crab, sausage I've ever had and the service was superb. Oddly enough they even have fantastic wings if you're not feeling the seafood that night, make sure to ask for them the old style (or messy, they'll know what you mean). 

 I strongly recommend stopping in and enjoying at least a pound of the shrimp and/or crab. When you stop in be sure to introduce yourself to the entire staff, if nothing else Rick up at the bar.

Great Food, Great Staff, Great Experience!!!"}
{"text":"This is a cool place to experience if you haven't been. It's a blue collar type of place so expect to get your hands dirty; they do have plastic aprons for those who are scared. They do birthday shot outs by ringing a bell and siren so loud it could freak you out at first. We experienced a handful of shot outs tonight so we got used to it.

I ordered a pound of shrimp (heads on of course) with corn, sausage, and red potatoes smothered in a trifecta sauce. Its served in a plastic bag, you have the option to increase the spicyness of sauce but I chose to go with none this time. Everything was delicious but the best thing were the sausage. It's a smoked sausage but together with the trifecta sauce it just pairs so well.

Two things were not so good here. My wife ordered the shrimp po boy which she didn't enjoy very much. It had more breading than needed and the bread was stale. She had the sweet potato fries in the side which were good. The other thing is they fry the kids chicken tenders with the same oil they fry fish in. If your allergic to fish or don't enjoy the smell then you shouldn't order any poultry.

We didn't get to taste the BBQ this time around but we will next time."}
{"text":"I'd say it was an \"ok\" experience. Not great, not terrible, just right in the middle. 

I ordered a martini, and got a 1oz shot of room temp vodka, then resorted to walking over to the bar and asking for some ice to chill my \"martini\".

Service was slow and lackluster, and what I ordered (boiled shrimp) they had run out of, so instead they brought me battered (fried) shrimp, which I could not eat because I have celiac disease. Then I waited another 25 minutes for my food while everyone else was finishing up.

Oh, and even with a reservation we still waited 45 minutes for a table on a week night.

The spicy veggie bags were pretty good though."}
{"text":"Over a year later and WOW! Much have been improved. Lets start with the food since it has always been my number one complaint. We ordered 2 pounds of shrimp and and snow crab. Quality was near perfect, it was seasoned just right and came out very quickly. In the past when it came out that fast we would end up sending it back for being undercooked; it seems like they got their cook timing correct. I'm guessing they already had most of the popular items precooked and they just need to measure it out and add the sauce.
The service has much improved too; he got the orders correct and was very tentative throughout our meal. Aside from having to wait an hour and half it was actually worth it after experiencing this improvement. Hopefully they keep this up! You've finally made a believer out of me."}
{"text":"This place was one of my top 3 until they did away with the only thing I went there to eat...the salmon boil with vegis. Until they bring that back, I won't be visiting again! Bummer and very disappointing."}
{"text":"Ordered the catfish basket for lunch . Very good . Had the Cajun fries , slight seafood taste to the fries . Had a bonus they also have MLB network"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! I was incredibly skeptical to eat here. The idea of eating off the table and people wearing bibs just creeps me out. If I had known that Angry Crab is like that I would have refused to go. But I'm so glad I went!

This place is very unapologetic. They are loud. There is writing all over the walls. They make an embarassig hullabaloo when it's your birthday. But it's all in the carefree fun of the place.

The prices are incredibly fair and the staff always walks you through the entire process. You can choose what kind of seafood you want, what dressing for it to be boiled in, and spice level. Spice level tends to be on the hotter side. I like to think I can tolerate a high level of spice but a #3 was good for me.

Don't get scared to get a bit messy. It happens to the best of us. The bibs and rolls stacks of napkins are there for a reason. They also have a huge sink in the restaurant to wash your hands which I think is a nice touch.

Since going my first time I have gone several more and think about it way more than I care to admit. I'm hooked! But in all fairness I am a HUGE seafood fan so I may (or may not be ) biased."}
{"text":"Yesterday was our first visit...
The crab legs were steamed to perfection and the \"trifecta\" sauce was delicious.  The soft shell crab basket with Cajun fries is a new seafood favorite for me.  The waitstaff were super friendly and helped us first-timers navigate the menu.  

The upside is that the food is awesome and the atmosphere fun.  The downside is that they are opening an Angry Crab Shack near where we live and it may be too convenient and difficult to stay away from.  Definitely our new favorite seafood place"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Not a huge variety of different seafoods but I had the mussels with 2 carrots and 2 potatoes and 4 sausages bag and shared a basket of Gator nuggets. Everything was so good and so well prepared. Will most likely go back and might try a po' boy next time."}
{"text":"To start off I'm a fan of seafood , the customer service was great. We had Val for our server & she was amazing . Very attentive & always made sure we had everything we needed & we never went dry on drinks . 
Onto the food .... there trifecta is horrible , it use to be very good but ever since the kitchen manger or supervisor changed up the sauce it's horrible. Taste like a mouthful of just BUTTER !! Yuck , no flavor , just plain greasy buttery . Had to make my own sauce out of salt & pepper with a pinch of Tabasco. My thoughts should leave the seasonings how they use to be. Will stick to HOT N JUICY CRAWFISH forever on . & your guys oysters suck . To small ! Highly disappointed"}
{"text":"Good food...the noise level is pretty loud service was ok...overall glad I tried it but not sure I will visit again"}
{"text":"This place was a blast. I mean eating seafood with heads and tails still attached is always a blast. Especially when your waiter makes them dance! Food was ok. This was probably more of the experience fun rather than delicious food. Food was good. Just not toe curling delicious"}
{"text":"I love seafood and eat it often, we tried this spot on a Friday evening. Stopped in ordered a to go for 2 adults and a toddler. I ordered a lb of shrimp in a bag with sausage potatoes and a side of frog legs, I ate frog legs quite often back in CA in my younger days. So the shrimp were great, big and firm but the frog legs were as my toddler would say \"yucky\",I could tell they were from a lake or something muddy they tasted like I had just swallowed a mouth full of muddy water. I had my hopes up on introducing new food to my bf and he couldn't stomach it. Besides everything being fried, our fave were the shrimp and andoullie sausage."}
{"text":"First time eating here and it was so delicious. A really fun atmosphere and great service all around. Our server Lupe was so amazing. He answered any questions we had and gave great recommendations. I would definitely recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Angry Crab Shack is Arizona's version of Boiling Crab/Hot 'N Juicy, and this version is not bad.  It sucks that it's located all the way in Mesa, which means that I have to drive 40 minutes to eat here, but that's still better than having to drive 400 miles to LA or 280 miles to Vegas to eat at the aforementioned Cajun seafood spots.  So, can't really complain.  Would I come here again? Maybe - onto the food:

There were four of us, so we ordered a lot   The first thing we requested was the crawfish, but were told that they were out of it that day.  Bummer.  We then ordered 4 pounds of shrimp (with a few potatoes/corn/sausage mixed in), a pound of clams, the biggest Dungeness crab available, and a pound of mussels - all medium/trifecta.  We started with a dozen oysters, got a couple orders of Cajun fries, and ordered a few IPA's.  

The food looks and somewhat tastes like the offerings at Boiling Crab - plastic bags, oil & juices spilling everywhere, etc.  To start off, the oysters were great - fresh, meaty, and bright.  The shrimp were decent, but the seasonings/spices didn't penetrate the meat enough, and I pretty much mopped up all of the sauce/poured on hot sauce to help give it more flavor.  Likewise with the clams and mussels, with about a 1/4 of the mussels still closed and the clams being the most flavorless.  

I liked the crab the best out of all of the dishes - for 3 pounds (at $12 per, it's a little pricey considering how much meat you actually extract from the animal), there was barely enough meat for each of us to get a decent taste, but it was delicious nonetheless.  I ordered a side of rice to mix in with the best part of the crab, the innards and soup that is exposed when the carapace is ripped off.  Two bucks well spent!  The fries were good, and the chicken tender baskets we ordered for the kiddos were good too, although they took way too long to come out (with impatient kids, that is no small issue).  

I don't know, it wasn't a bad experience at all - it's definitely a fun place to eat, as all eat-with-your-hands establishments should be.  I just wish all of the seafood was seasoned better.  In the meantime, I guess this place'll satisfy my Boiling Crab craving whenever that craving hits."}
{"text":"Dress down and get down with some traditional Gulf Coast seafood. They bring all the best of southern cooking and style to this place. There ain't nuttin like dis place."}
{"text":"This place is legit!! The atmosphere is perfect- bar in the middle, bib-mandatory, games and music at night, smoker in the back, and the list goes on! The staff know their stuff!! The experience starts with hands-on white paper table cloth, personalized with the server's name and a circle designated for the \"tools\". Seriously some of the best service I've ever experienced, ours even took us on a tour of the place! 

About the food- it's a bag boil with an edge. You can choose the meat and sauce, and it comes with a side of your choice. I'd highly recommend the trifecta sauce and crawfish. Super fresh and cooked to perfection. You really can't go wrong though. Cajun fries weren't the best BUT not for a lack of flavor, next time I go I'll probably ask for extra crispy. You eat with your hands, so make sure to wash them ;)

According to our waitress, this place is one of the starts to the beginning of a national chain. I just hope Ahwatukee gets more awesome restaurants like this!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now & each time the service, food & drinks are delish. We started visiting Angry Crab Shack in SOCAL & had associated it with vacay until this location opened. Now it's just yummy in the tummy food. I almost always get the Shrimp, Trifecta seasoning with red potatoes, bread for dipping (DUH). The bar staff are excellent & Cat is hysterical."}
{"text":"Delicious Barbecue and seafood. Fun atmosphere. Looking forward to going back next time I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We definitely don't come here for the service. Always get excited to eat the crab here but then instantly regret it when we arrive. Out of 10 times, I'd say we had a good server twice. Every other time we are ignored for 10 minutes and the servers act like we are an annoyance rather than customers. Almost to the point where it's not even worth coming here for the food.."}
{"text":"Yummy mixed bag boil, trifecta sauce was great on the Tuesday night special of Clams, Huge Shrimp & Snow Crab $20. Filled my husband & I need for seafood not an easy feat in AZ."}
{"text":"It is so good!!!

Great service, spicy but flavorful sea food in a bag!

I'm now dreaming of when I can go back!
A friend and I shared... Then ordered Mac n cheese and cornbread. All were delicious!

I definitely recommend going but bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went and had the snow crab with the lemon pepper he had a 3 (pretty spicy) while I had a 1 (mild) I loved the flavor of the lemon pepper in mine he said he prefers the tri fecta. Everything is delicious!  The only issue  (if you can call it one) is they never have enough of those small forks for opening the crab we had to share a set of scissors. I prefer to have my own utensils.  It is a casual come as you are place. So, I guess that's why we had to share.  

They do have a wax paper type of table cloth, this is where you pour out your transparent plastic bag onto.no plates, no spoons, be ready to use your hands.  
 The flavors pour out of the steamed bag and just melt on your tongue. Totally worth going. Even if you have to share the scissors."}
{"text":"I was stoked to hear about this place because I was hoping it would be the solution to my Boiling Crab cravings.  It's quite inconvenient to make the 350 mile drive to California...and I crave Boiling Crab like, everyday.  

The concept is exactly the same as Boiling Crab - choose your seafood, choose your seasoning and choose your spice level.  There's a variety of fried seafood baskets that come with Cajun fries (or regular), wings, various sides such as corn and sausage- again, exactly like BC.  Only thing is, this place is obviously more expensive, as we don't live by the sea and it costs more to acquire seafood.  

Anyway.  We came in with a group of 5 at about 6 pm so this is right before the dinner rush, so the place was quite empty.  We put in our order of 2 lbs of clams, 8 pieces of sausage, 1 corn, Cajun fries, a dozen naked fried wings, and a side of macaroni salad.   And about 15 minutes later our food came out.  

+ Taste/Flavor :  It has potential, it really does.  But our bag of seafood was not hot.  It was not even warm.  It was like, semi lukewarm, which translates to the combination of the butter and spices being completely separated and not mixed well to form any kind of harmonious deliciousness to coat the seafood.  The spices sat in globs throughout the bag, while the butter was stale.  Once we shake the hell out of the bag to attempt to mix the butter/spices, the overall flavor was good - not too salty, not to garlicky, but I ain't trying to mess with cold butter doughy globs of spices.  The wings were bland, but the texture was great.  Mac salad was just mac salad, corn is always good no matter what, sausage was sausage to me, and the cajun fries were the best part of my meal. They had a light breading that made 'em crunchy yet soft inside, and the seasoning was spot on. 

+ Service : Though our server was a nice person,  his service is nothing to write home about.  He forgot our Cajun fries and macaroni salad, which weren't brought out til we nearly finished our food.  He only checked on us once and never refilled our drinks - I had to flag down another server.  It wasn't even busy at the time.  I usually don't complain about service, as I'd rather be left alone to eat in peace but when I keep having to ask for multiple things that should've been brought to me, it gets annoying.

Those of us who are used to being spoiled by BC's deliciousness should keep an open mind when trying this place for the first time, as this ISN'T BC and it's a new restaurant and they're not established like BC, which is why I didn't come with high expectations.  It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great."}
{"text":"Came back in 4th of July. Knew they closed early so we hurried in. The service was awful. They were out of everything. I did the shrimp again bc it was good last time. No flavor and the heads. Omg. Last time there were no heads. I couldn't eat them. I felt so sick. Wish our server offered the option, wish she actually paid attention, no water refills. I remember gloves last time. Sad bc I liked this place and was excited but will NOT be back. This was my reply:
I'm so very sorry that you had a disappointing experience on the 4th. I'd like to ask a couple of questions to see how we can fix this for future visits. First, do you remember the name of your server? Did you ask to speak to a manager during your visit? Do you remember what we were out of that night?

I would also like to state a couple of items about our service so we are all on the same page. Our shrimp boil is head-on. We don't routinely offer head-off, but we do have it available upon request for an additional $2 per pound. Gloves are also not automatic, but are offered if our Pacific Rim sauce is ordered, or if you as a guest specifically ask for them.

Regarding the lack of attention at your table, that is inexcusable, and we will address it immediately when you provide the name or a description of your server. I have copied the General Manager of the Ahwatukee location as well as one of the owners on this email.

Thank you for your candor. We can't get better if we don't know where we are weak. I appreciate your honest feedback.

I feel I have was blamed. I gave him info he requested and never heard back."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. If you love seafood and cajun food I would recommend this place. It's hands on food which makes it fun!"}
{"text":"Love it! Haven't had a single bad thing or experience here! Food is amazing (shrimp, crab, lobster, mussels, hush puppies, and Cajun fries are my go to every time!) trifecta 2 on everything with a side of trifecta 5 for a volcanic dipping experience! When we go it can get a little pricey but it's mostly because I can't help myself and I order so much with alcohol as well.. Staff is amazing and the food is phenominal. Nice work guys and keep it up!"}
{"text":"what a great experience I had here! it was the first time I went to the crab shack with my family and it was absolutely amazing and delicious! I got muscles, shrimp, crawl fish with the angry ghost heat. Their seafood was fresh and their trifecta sauce was killer, I love it a lot because I love spicy food. The place had nice decoration and the service was awesome. Definitely recommend it to everyone:)"}
{"text":"Worth the wait. Staff is great.  Making my mouth salivate. Yes, that was cheesy, but this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"This review is completely based on the service we received today which was horrible! The food itself was good but the service was by far the most horrible service I've experienced. When we were seated our waitress gave us our menus and we ordered some drinks which all came at separate times. Then when we were ready to order we waited and waited. Finally got our order in and needed refills by that time. Waitress walked past us many times with my husband having an empty cup. We asked for a refill and another waitress came over to bring it (my husband said thank you very much) while she rolled her eyes and walked away. I never knew asking for a refill was such a bother. We were with our friends and we all received our meals 15 minutes apart. So by the time one of us was more than halfway through our meal, the next person got there's which I've NEVER been to a restaurant that has this sort of system and I'm sure they don't normally operate like that but it was pathetic. I'm sorry but I can honestly say I won't be back unless they get rid of the miserable, unhappy, staff they have serving people."}
{"text":"Amazing seafood in the far west valley - finally!!  I had the shrimp in trifecta sauce (medium) with red potatoes and my husband had the Mahi Mahi badket.  It was all amazing.  The staff is all incredibly friendly (Susie is AWESOME!) the entire visit was fun and filled with the best seafood.  5 star experience.   Thank you for bringing this to Goodyear."}
{"text":"We went here recently on a Wednesday night around 8 pm.  Nice environment and a decent size crowd for a Wednesday night. My wife and each ordered the bag boil.  She had the king crab legs and I had the shrimp.   We both had the trifecta sauce and added vegetables and red potatoes to our bags.  The shrimp were tasty and nicely sized.  My wife said the crabs legs were very good with a sweet flavor.  I recommend adding the vegetables and red potatoes.  There was a wide variety of vegetables and the red potatoes were a nice addition.

The bag size portion is large so there is plenty to eat.  The next time we go, we are going to split a bag and also order BBQ to see how that tastes. The service was good and our meals came out timely.  For the amount we paid, there was good value in what we received."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a friend today and was very impressed. We started with the grilled oysters which were really excellent. Then I had the soft shell crab. The crab and cajun fries were awesome, the potato salad was decent. The best was the muscles 3 hot with the trifecta. Really awesome, I look forward to trying this place again soon!"}
{"text":"So if anyone knows me I love angry crab!! I use to go to the one on almaschool 3-4 times a week... Love love that place and the staff there is amazing ... When I found out they open a location near my house I was so excited !!! Decide to try this location out and yes the service is good and so are the food.. My cousin and I went to this place so many time Bc they have BBQ food ...   My cousin and I seriously love the new location. We haven't been back to the almaschool location for a long time :( but after what happened the last time I might going back the old location again!! The reason I give this location 3 star Because 2 weekend ago my family visited from out of town and they want eat at hot and juicy I told them they have to try out angry crab!!! Its way better than hot and juicy !!  After a little convincing they decide to give this place a try... Well let just said they'll never go back to this place again... The service was ok ... The waiter seem irritated with us Bc we were asking for to much stuff (lemon,salt,pepper,hot sauce) ... The normal stuff  ok beside that our food was raw... I'm not talking about the raw oyster!!! Our crabs was not cook!!! Eww !! Other food might be raw too but can't tell Bc all the sauce on it!!! My whole family actually got sick the next day... Everyone got food poison  trust me between throwing up and being on the toilet for 2-3 days is not a fun thing... If you have food poison before you would know what I am talking about ... NOT FUN !!!! But Not sure what make us sick from there ... The raw crabs? Oyster? Etc... We couldn't figure it out Bc we order so much stuff. It was nice they offer to cook us a new bag of crabs .. But by the time we saw the crabs was not cook we all got gross out... I'll probably stay away from this place for awhile My stomach can't handle another round like that !!!"}
{"text":"king crab was great...shrimp excellent. I would pass on the veggies next time...ours were a mushy mess and way too much squash. Triple special sauce was excellent. Corn on the cob was excellent. Next time gonna try the snow crab and see if it's worth the price for the king crab. Our waitress was a little overwhelmed, waiter next to us was the bomb and helped out. We will be back. :)"}
{"text":"We live on the middle of the desert but their seafood is incredible! I love this plave.  The scenery,  food and staff are all just wonderful!!! Get the crab legs!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place, it has a laid-back atmosphere, staff was reasonably on top of things, and I like the menu. We tried mussels on garlic sauce, I thought they were phenomenal. Gator? Oh yeah, LOVED the gator bites, and the dipping sauce that came with them. I had snow crab with Cajun sauce and a spice level 3- I like spicy, but I still want to be able to taste my food, and level 3 took me just to the limits of my spice comfort zone, so I'll scale back next time. The hubby had traditional boiled crab with level 0 spice... He thinks ketchup is hot. The bad news: they still put Cajun seasoning on them, and he thought they were too hot. Suggestion: put \"just steamed and unseasoned\" on the menu for Tenderfoots- at least on the secret menu!! (otherwise I won't be able to come back). I had abita's purple haze- raspberry wheat beer. Yummmm! Just a hint of berry, definitely not too sweet, great stuff :-) now for the reason for a mere 4 stars: NOISY!!! and we weren't allowed to sit outside on this absolutely gorgeous evening for lack of a server!
I almost forgot to mention: I love that you order pretty much everything a la carte- the other places sell you a whole meal and charge you for everything in it, so you're stuck with sides you can't really squeeze into your belly if you plan on eating all your sea food. Here, you buy the seafood by the pound, if you think you want a veggie, you add it, if you really think you have room for potatoes, add them. But if you really just want to gorge yourself on meat, you won't be paying for stuff you didn't want. Good thinking!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I + brother in law visited tonight for our celebratory first paycheck of our new jobs meal and it was OUTSTANDING from start to finish! 

Our server Barb was very friendly and super helpful as it was our first time visiting an angry crab location. She broke down the menu for us and explained the seasonings and heat levels expertly so we felt confident when we ordered. 

My wife loved that they also had BBQ items on the menu as she always want JUST seafood and she's pretty picky about what shellfish she will eat. We ordered a pound of crawfish, 1 Dungeness crab (under 2 pounds) both with the trifecta and 1 level heat, hush puppies, Cajun fries and Mac and cheese. The brother in law and myself got down hard on the crustaceans and my wife LOVED the mac and cheese with a few bites of crab thrown her way as well!

The secret star of the show though honestly was the hush puppies, holy cornmeal and onions were they delicious! They made my southern boy soul want to slap my grandma (although I would feel very guilty about it later to be sure). Seriously though folks, it was a little on the high side for dinner but definitely well worth the extra money, all the seafood was super fresh and delicious and the sides were killer! 

Good job angry crab! You've made us really angry (in the very best way possible) fans!"}
{"text":"First time ever. Waiter very friendly, explained menu and checked on us often. Overall, good service. I ordered shrimp in the bag and really enjoyed peeling and deveining the seafood. My fault, ordered mild sauce. Husband ordered crab claws with trifecta, he loved it. Fries were delicious.  Enjoyed the atmosphere,  the paper table cloths, bibs and buckets.  Priced reasonably well. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"SLOW SERVERS!!!!! An hour to sit, order, eat and I still have not gotten my bill. 

But Awesome BBQ!  I ordered the gator nuggets, beef brisket smanich & crawfish.  All was cooked just right. Thirty heat rating I'd off a little. I got medium & my lips are burning. I generally eat lots of spicy food so I am not a amateur by any means. Seafood comes in bags & you get a bib to wear.   Seafood is very pricy..All by the pound. King crab was $24 a lb... way too expensive for me."}
{"text":"We heard about this place from friends. How did I not know the Angry Crab existed? I am a huge Fan of shellfish and hate paying high prices for add-ins such as potatoes and vegies so that's why I got so excited to eat here. Shellfish is by the pound, you pick the seasoning and temperature. They so had a lot of fried food too. I had the king crab, mussels, fried clams and cajon fries. I wasn't too impressed with the clams as it was hard to taste any clam. The breading, however was seasoned well.  get ready to feel like your eating cake on your first birthday!!  No eating utensils or plates. Just you, a crab cracker and paper table cloth. Get ready to get really messy. When I was finished I asked for a wet wipe but our server directed me to a public washing area with two sinks. THATS what I'm talking about!!! Delicious and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Wow, that's about all I can say is \"WoW\" prices aren't for the faint of heart but food is for the soul. The trifecta sauces are da bomb. The only way to go. We did the medium heat which realistically was a tad much. We will be sure to go down a level next time. This is my new favorite place. I have known about this place for a couple of years just never got around to coming here. Will be sure to rectify this in the future. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great as always. My wife had the snow crab legs and she said they are awesome. I had the mussels.  They were huge and delicious. Hush puppies are killer as was the calamari.  We keep going back for more!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to take my parents before the left to go back home.  We searched Yelp and all agreed that this place sounded good and most importantly, different.  We were very please.  We went at an off time, kind of between lunch and dinner and the place was busy, but not overly.  I had the crawfish, number 4 on the hot scale with the Cajun seasoning.  I was not disappointed at all.  My wife had the boiled shrimp with the same seasoning but a number 3.  My fault I forgot to ask for  the heads to be removed and she was not to happy about that, but she was a trooper and dug in.  Again, very good.  My parents had the fried shrimp and cod baskets.  The portions were big and they both liked their choices.  Their only complaint was the Cajun seasoning on the fries (they don't do hot well).  We also had 1/2 dozen raw oysters and hushpuppies as an app.  I swear on my Yelp account (LOL) the best hushpuppies I have ever had.  The dipping sauce was very good as well.  So, 6 draft beers, 1/2 dozen oysters, order of hushpuppies, 2 lbs of crawfish, 1 lbs of shrimp, fried shrimp and cod basket plus the added sausage to two of the orders = $90 before tip.  Not bad."}
{"text":"If you like shellfish, this place is a must try. We started with Dog Park Dark on draft - (Hello! Fabulous local beer) and Hurricanes in 12 oz. canning jars.  

Then on to the food. The Angry Crab takes the boil-in-bag style to a new level. We had king crab in Pacific Rim level 3 (coconut curry flavor!), Dungeness crab in Trifecta level 2, veggies in traditional boil, and hush puppies. Next we ordered a lobster in Pacific Rim level 3 (yes, we liked it that much!). The seafood was all fabulous. The veggie bag is really interesting and included butternut squash, spaghetti squash, lotus root, and daikon in addition to the more traditional veggie mix. The place was pretty busy for a Tuesday night and the service was fabulous. Three different servers helped us, so we never felt neglected. One server told me that they share tips so they all help each other. It showed. This was our second visit to the Angry Crab and we loved it both times. It is a little spendy, but it's a fun way to enjoy some seriously fantastic food."}
{"text":"I was here for dinner last night, was not planning on coming here but I didn't like Joe's Crab Shack and I found this little place on yelp, it was to die for...."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed about my order. I had the pound of snow crabs and Char-grilled oysters. The lack of the meat in the crabs was disappointing. The oysters were small and burnt. Definitely not worth the $12. I had a better food experience at Boiling Crab, therefore I will NOT return to Angry Crab."}
{"text":"If you've ever been to The Boiling Crab in California or Vegas, this is as close as it gets here in Arizona. I've been to this place at least 5 or 6 times now and I'm glad to see that they are listening to feedback and are continuously improving. It may be that it's off season but I've noticed many times they are out of at least one or two different items. My only experience are with their shrimp, crawfish, cajun fries, and gumbo. It's pretty tasty and if you're looking for good seafood I would definitely give them a shot."}
{"text":"First time here and it was pretty busy on a Sunday night. Can't imagine what the wait times are on a Friday or Saturday. We got the King Crab and brisket sandwich and both were A+ and good drinks also, I enjoyed the Purple Haze. 

The only negatives were they forgot about the brisket sandwich, so it took over 30 min to get it but they took it off the bill. I could have used better tools besides cheap scissors to crack giant claws. And glad we got here early because the next table tried to order BBQ and they were out. 

Enjoyed this place and would come back again for a birthday or fun occasion."}
{"text":"It's probably a bad thing this place is so close to my house. I go every week at least once for shrimp now. I think it's not in the best spot since they don't seem very busy when I go for lunch. Let's hope Yelp will send more people their way in the future.  I have never ordered the bar-be-que here and I am not sure with the other choices in the valley why they even have that as an option. It just seems to make the restaurant overly smokey.  The real reason to go is to get the seafood. They sell it by the pound with whatever choice of spice you want. I usually just get traditional boil medium which is the normal \"Old Bay\" tasting shrimp.  They are always cooked very well and taste great add an ear of corn and some sausage if you are feeling it.  The mussels with the trifecta sauce ( garlic, cajun, lemon pepper ) are really tasty and well cooked everytime I get them. If you are feeling super hungry they have excellent hush puppies and onion rings.

Food to Try:

- Shrimp \"Traditional\" Medium
- Mussels \"Trifecta\" Medium
- Onion Rings"}
{"text":"It's pretty bad when it's cold in the restaurant. So cold that many of the waitresses are either wearing sweat shirts or flannel shirts over their t shirts. It's even worse when the staff make excuses and don't seem to give a rats a$$.   I heard other customers at nearby tables complain about the temperature as well. 

Probably never coming back to this location. The waitress was very polite and was on the ball. But it's sad that the management doesn't seem to care about the comfort of the patrons. 

Too bad because I used to like this location."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Angry Crab Shack last night for dinner. My son LOVES crab legs. He ordered 2 lbs of King crab legs and they were incredible. The crab legs were big and MEATY! My husband ordered the ribs with beans and potatoes. Also very good. The BBQ sauce has just the right smokey and sweet flavor and the beans and potatoes were great too. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fries and beans. I loved all of it but the fries were incredible! Crispy and seasoned just right! 

The atmosphere is fun with writing all over the walls. There is table seating a bar. It is loud but great for large groups and kiddos. The service is great as well. It was a very busy Friday night and for our party of 3 it only took about 10 minutes to get a table. Bonus points for the text you get when your table is ready! 

Special thanks to the staff for the great service throughout and our amazing server Jeff."}
{"text":"Right off the bat we have issues! With such a focused menu you'd expect them to have everything, but you'd be wrong. No Blue Crab! How does a Crab Shack not have Crab? Also, they refuse to sell the corn on the cob as a side unless you order a boiler. Ordered half a dozen oysters on the half shell and left since I couldn't get anything else I wanted. The oysters were alright, my wife liked her fish but her slaw was very bland. NOT IMPRESSED! They get two stars because their service was fast and pleasant."}
{"text":"I loved loved loved this place jenn was awesome she recommended all the great sea food! I also had the brisket which was off the chain!!! Also the manager was awesome kept checking up on us! Great place !!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to have an Angry Crab in our neighborhood. I'm happy to say it didn't disappoint. 
Marisol was out waitress and server. She was so friendly and attentive. She took the time to explain how everything worked for my fiance who had never been to an Angry Crab before. 
I ordered the Calamari Strip for an appetizer and my fiancé ordered the Gumbo. My Calamari was cooked just right. But, my fiancé ' s Gumbo stole the show! 
It was seasoned perfectly and had mouth watering flavor. I tried to order one to go before we left but it was all gone.  
For our main entrées I ordered the Snow Crab Legs with the Trifecta seasoning level 2 for the spice with corn on the cob, sausage and red potatoes. The crab was moist and bursting with flavor, as were the potatoes and sausage. 
 My fiancé ordered the King Crab legs with the Trifecta Seasoning level 2 with corn on the cob.  He could barely talk from enjoying his food so much.
We were both very impressed with the service and we're quite surprised to find out that one of the owners refilled our water. So nice and humble! 
All we can say is everyone was so friendly and personable.  
This location also has BBQ and pizza. Although, we didn't get to try them we heard great things about those items. We will be back to test everything! Welcome to Ahwatukee Angry Crab! We're so happy to have you here!"}
{"text":"Angry Crab & BBQ ( on Ray Road) is a good spot for a seafood boil. I'm a big fan of New Orleans, and usually when I go on a trip there through Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, hitting up the Angry Crab on the return drive home seems to just put a smile on my face and extend our NOLA trip that little bit longer. I have been a fan of Angry Crab and would invest 30 minutes or more waiting in line at the Mesa location. This Ray Road location is a much more spacious location, meaning I get seated immediately. My husband and I always order the same thing, I get king crab and he gets shrimp. The fun is choosing which of the variety of boils to pick. My husband likes traditional ( Old Bay) and I like the trifecta ( butter, garlic, and old bay together). I always think to myself, next time I'll try the pacific or next time I'll pick a new boil, but I look forward to the flavor so much I can't do it. Also you get to pick your heat level. I warn you now, if you like it hot, they will ring a loud horn to tell everyone. I sort of forget and get embarrassed. 
In additional to the many seafood choices, one can order gumbo, sandwiches, and a variety of sides. We picked the fried clams based on a recommendation of a server and they were tasty, although on this occasion had sand on them; it's a risk I guess, but in the 2 times I had ordered them at the Tucson location they were perfect. It you are in the mood for a little New Orleans, there almost always is some fun brass band music playing and it just is a delight. The cocktails are served in plastic go cups, just like many bars in the French Quarter near Bourbon Street. So get your Hurricane or Big Easy in prepare for some spicy boil and enjoy.
One thing I miss at this location verses the Mesa spot, is it's so big; you don't get the same charm as the Angry Crab in Mesa. We often chatted with other customers about how hot the 4 vs 5 level was. There is a camaraderie of the patrons who you'd been standing with to get in to eat. The Mesa location had special pralines ( at least one time we were there); which is very much like going to a shop in New Orleans. The staff have always been attentive at this location, but don't seem to have the same festive energy. So when they yell out \"Hey everyone, someone likes it hot!\" and push the horn, it's on a huge group of diners, that is for the most part ignoring them."}
{"text":"I love the 1lb bag of shrimp and 1lb bag of crawfish with trifecta sauce and hot! Omg so delicious! The Cajun fries are bomb. The frog legs are bomb! The oysters are bomb! The hushpuppies are a little thick for me but they're so good! I could eat here probably every day of my life."}
{"text":"GOD This place was good... and the wait staff and really ALL the employees... were just so darn nice and friendly... I couldn't have asked for a nicer experience.... Truly"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, yes. We live in the desert. We are land locked...BUT this was some of the best Cajun seafood I've had outside of NOLA! The seasonings alone are redunk! My hubby and I had the Dixie Peach to drink. Holy crap! Was feeling it after 2 sips! Delicious! We got the pound of snow crap, pound of of shrimp and added potatoes and sausage. The atmosphere is cool. Graffiti on the walls, yet a clean well maintained dinning room. Lots of TV's around, great place to catch a game! Great music. Wait staff is on point and friendly! Casual party feel- bring a group to make it more fun! I recommend getting the seasoning at medium to start, it helps slow you down from devouring your whole meal in less than a minute;) Definitely will be going back to this place on the regular!"}
{"text":"Tried this after several friends mentioned how good it was, came away a big fan!  We tried both the snow crab in the trifecta sauce as well as the fried cod with fries.  The crab really won me over.  Soft, juicy, spiced just right, each bite convinced me we should have ordered more!   We had ordered butter as a dipping sauce but it wasnt necessary.  
The fried cod was not spectacular.  It wasnt bad but it was not anything special.  However the fries could happen again!  They were crispy and tasty, and made me feel much better about their fried food.  I will go back again, though I will stick with the crab boil."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try because we wanted great seafood. We were not disappointed with Angry Crab. We were greeted by a friendly face who took our name and number. You get a text message to let you know when your table is ready which is nice so, your not worrying if your name was called or not. There really isn't much seating if the place is busy and you have to wait to be seated so, we decided to wait in our car. The wait for two was about 15 minutes and the place was jammed packed. As we were taken to our seats I noticed the walls were covered with writing and next to our table we had a figurine filled with a football, Mardi Gras beads and a beer. There were TV's mounted on the wall playing sports which was perfect for my husband. The theme I could tell was one to conjure up vibes of laid back fun. Our waitress Steph was friendly and explained everything to us about how to order your by the pound bagged seafood and thoroughly informed us about the full size soft shell crabs that would come with our basket. She also helped me select the peach delight which turned out to be an amazing delight sure not to disappoint ones who choose to err on the side of a strong drink. Every time Gumbo is on a menu I have to try it! I also had an inkling we would need some bread to sop up the juices from the seafood bag. I was right the trifecta a combo of garlic, lemon pepper and Cajun seasonings what your seafood marinates in was out of this world delicious! You're not going to want to let it go to waste. We love spicy but, were warned it gets hot! We went for the mild (wimpy) and were definitely pleased. Lots of kick but, not too much where we couldn't enjoy our food. Don't be rattled when you hear sirens blaring it's just the staff wishing someone Happy Birthday! I really did enjoy myself here! Such a fun night out."}
{"text":"Omg love it!!! First time here, had the King Crab legs with the Trifecta sauce #2 Heat and 1 Corn on the Cob...Some Root beer to wash it down...I think it's my favorite restaurant in Phoenix, so far...it's so delicious, flavorful, and just the right amount of zest and heat to make me happy and satisfied...plus eating with the scissors made my meal fun to eat and not frustrating...so much better than those crab cracker things...MY TIP FOR YOU: after you remove the meat from the shell...dip it, roll it, soak it in the sauce at the bottom of the bag and get the full blown flavor experience...
Amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food and ambience but can be pricey.... But, is good! Can be messy so if your trying to look pretty don't wear white.. You order by the pound and cant mix and match . Must order by pound so if you want blue crab then its 1lb.. You can add sausage, potato, corn and it comes in a sack... Tv screens everywhere with mostly sports on and a full bar...... GET READY TO GET DIRTY!! Oh ya!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this location.  Had been loyal to the Cactus & 75 ave location but the trifecta sauce was losing its flavor.   Each time I had to ordered extra butter and was charged for it.   Kept telling manager ( she is awsome )the sauce was terrible she would tell the head Manager but seemed he didnt care cause nothing changed.    I am so glad I tried this Angry Crab location.   The atmosphere is so much more friendly and open, makes you feel you are at  the beach.  I had the shrimp, trifecta, 2.  Awsome sauce did not have order extra butter.  This is my new Angry Crab location.  Also all the staff is very friendly"}
{"text":"Get the trifecta sauce is unreal with medium heat. Plan on a lb per person. Really yummy experience. Had the shrimp and crab which was so YUM"}
{"text":"I love this delightful shellfish shack; it has a casual and fun feel to it.  Come prepared to get messy - they lay down butcher paper on the table to soak spillage (and there is a lot of spillage).  I appreciate the simple concept of selecting your shellfish, sauce, spice and additions.  The #2 - Sizzlin was pretty hot.  I ordered the Trifecta sauce (garlic, lemon, and Cajun) and it was tasty but too hot for me.  I ordered the mild = wimpy on the second visit.  They serve the shellfish in a plastic bag that is plopped down on your table and you go crazy pulling out the meat.  It is fun but messy - wear the bib. Butter is not served with the lobster or crab, you have to request it as an add on.  The restaurant is crazy busy so expect a wait of at least an hour on the weekends.  The prices are reasonable for shellfish and the servers were attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Went to the Ahwatukee location to try it out tonight for dinner, fist impressions of the place was nice. The decorations were interesting. Very open, tables lined with paper, people with bibs on and the bar was full.  The hostess sat us and asked if we had ever been to their restaurants before and we replied \"no\".  She then walked away and said our server would be right with us. I was thinking she would explain the theme of the restaurant or the menu but I guess not.  

Our server came by and got our drink order.  While we were checking out the bar the manager came by and greeted us and asked us if this was first time we said yes, he thanked us for coming in and walked away, again no explanation of how the menu works or how things are prepared, not a big deal our server will get to that hopefully.   The food choices is short and simple, the back side is covered in different beers.  They might have more beer choices than food. 

Server comes back with our drinks and he explains the menu sections and market prices for seafood and the different seasonings. We started with hush puppies and a half dozen of oysters. We then ordered a pound of clams in the trifecta with corn and sausage. We also ordered  the soft shell crab po boy. 

Oysters and out and they were nothing special, golf oysters I think. The horseradish sauce was tasty, odd they served it with limes though. Hush puppies were good odd it was served with ranch. 

The clams, corn and sausage come out in a plastic bag. No plate to dump it out onto, different to be earring out of a plastic bag but kind of neat too. What surprised me was that my clams, corn and sausage were drowning in a butter garlic sauce.  not what I expected because the server didn't make mention that it was butter based until after we are and I asked him if all the sauces were butter based.  He neglected to tell us that all of them are butter based except for the plain boil which is water based and the pacific rim is curry based.  That would have been good to know before ordering. The menu states it's crab boil, I expected a crab boil.   I think I might have gotten 12 clams  and only 9 of them had meat in them. Sifting through the bag and sauce I found 1 piece of meat.   So for 12 bucks I got 10 pieces of clam. Totally understand the pound is including shell weight but at 12 bucks a pound I'd expect a piece of meat equivalent to the number of shells.   Sausage was tasty as was the corn. 

The soft shell crab po boy came with Cajun fries.  Fries were really good, good seasoning and crispy. The Po Boy, not so much. The crab had a real fishy taste to it, can't say I've ever had the same taste in other soft shell crab Po Boys I've eaten before.  The breading was so so, had a very heavy taste that left an after taste. 

Total bill came out to 50 bucks for two of us.  It was worth trying but for the money I've had better elsewhere. I might come back to try the gumbo.  

They are newly opened so hopefully the service works itself out. I can see this place being a decent place for happy hour or maybe lunch but I'd skip this place for dinner. 

Value in the food not so great, service was only ok but that should improve over time. Selection of beers was excellent. Overall I won't bring the family there but might do lunch or happy hour there."}
{"text":"I was definitely not impressed by their food or service. Service was slow & servers were not professional what so ever. I was really hoping that this would be the solution to my boiling crab cravings but was utterly disappointed. The sauce was not great and food was served somewhat \"cooled\". My bf loves oysters and lets just say it wasn't close to what we considered to be fresh. They were super small & did not look appetizing because they were probably scraped when they got opened. I will probably not come back here for a long while...,maybe when they get their service & food more organized. For now, it's not worth my drive from Avondale!"}
{"text":"By the way - the 4 stars given is in relation to other seafood places IN Arizona. G'z. Manage your expectations, people!

Anyway... 

Did a taste test between their frozen $8/lb & live crawfish $13/lb - definitely different as night & day. I've had decent frozen ones multiple times at their competitor's restaurant so I thought that maybe theirs would be the same. WRONG! Don't ever order the frozen ones here. As you're chewing it, it has that really old smell & taste like it was frozen in the 1920s, it's dry & the texture is like you're eating a damp paper mâché. You know what I mean? Maybe this chain has a different (read: subpar) supplier of frozen crawfish -- seems the crawfish were already borderline stale before they were frozen, & not while they were still fresh. Unpleasant. Not even the trifecta sauce could mask the \"unfreshness\" & salvage the taste. 

The live crawfish however are wow! Very tasty, delicious & tastes like how fresh crawfish should! Cooked just right so the meat retains its juiciness & decent crunch to it. And they are ginormous - like baby lobsters! (I wonder if they fed these crawfish cat... Just kidding!) Big fresh crawfish makes sucking those heads very enjoyable. Mmm. These were so huge I had a couple of heads that won't fit in my mouth! Ha! 

Ordered my crawfish with the trifecta sauce, which I'm not sure if I really like it. It is their answer to their competitor's signature sauce -- which I really love (of course I am quite partial to garlic). But I couldn't quite figure out the taste profile of this sauce - none of the Cajun, lemon, pepper and garlic flavors stood out nor held the flavors in a tastegasmic way, & together it doesn't seem like they work quite well... Maybe it needs more lemon & garlic?"}
{"text":"Enjoyed Father's Day dinner with the family here tonight! Wait for 8 was an hour and 20 minutes! Totally  alright it's Father's day. Seated in about an hour over quoted about 20 minutes. Our server was awesome. Patient with all the questions we had regarding the Father's day special. Got our drinks fast, food came quickly hot and fresh like always. Serve brought out all the tools for cracking and smashing. Brought us all bibs and gloves (if you've ever dined in you know these are nessary ) Not one complaint! Our server name was Tommy and he was excellent fast and efficient. Good server. If you have never been make sure your ready to get messy. Their prices change depending on the sea food market. They also have chicken tenders salads seemed veggies in bags! You also choose the level of flavor and hotness! It's a must try. The Goodyear location always rocks it. We dine in at least once a month! Thank you Tommy for making our Father's day dinner nice! You rocked it!"}
{"text":"Service was 5 stars. Food 3 stars. Got the fried clams to start and they were OK but pretty Sandy. Crunch crunch crunch. May need some dental work now. Next we ordered the shrimp and snow crab. Snow crab was great but a lot of work for not much meat compared to king crab... get what you pay for i guess. Ordered it spicy level 2. Which I do like spicy food and thought it had pretty good kick. So if you're sensitive to spice take note.  My mother-in-law thought it was too spicy on the shrimp at level 2. The shrimp was definitely overcooked. It tastes okay with all the spices and butter on it but it was definitely overcooked. Corn on the cob was also the little overcooked that kind of rubbery soggy texture it gets. All in all food was just okay but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I love Angry Crab. This was my first visit too this location, after about 10 minutes of nobody stopping by the table after being sat, the server stopped by too give us the list of everything they were out of... It would have been easier too tell us what they have! We just left since they didn't have most of what we came in for. I will be visiting Angry Crab again, just not this poorly run location"}
{"text":"We've been to two angry crabs and love it. However by far this was the best experience. Bar was quick...service was amazing and food was delicious. Kristin made us feel at home. A definite must!"}
{"text":"Andy and Alex were outstanding...we had crab legs ..with rhe tri fecta sauce...and they were amazing...a must go place any time of the day. Great time. Don't forget the IPA..."}
{"text":"Is it tomorrow yet, so I can go back?! Seriously, that's how much I loved this place. Hubs and I went in tonight (Thursday) around 5:30. There wasn't a wait, but most of the tables/booths were full already. We ended up being seated at a tiny table smack dab in the middle of the room, which was kind of annoying, but whatevs. Our server was friendly, and she made sure to check on us throughout the meal. We ordered the calamari strips, cajun fries, a pound of shrimp with trifecta seasoning/level 3 spice for me, pound of shrimp with trifecta seasoning/level 2 and king crab legs with garlic seasoning/level 3 for hubs. We opted out of wearing the plastic bibs, but I made sure to wear a black tee that I don't wear often enough to care if it got splattered with shrimpy goodness. Just rolling down the bag in order to get to the shrimp got me messy. It was then that my OCD kicked in and I was sure that I would hate the rest of the experience. Holy crap was I wrong. Yes it takes some work to get to your food, but it is SO worth it. Tear that head off the shrimp, suck down the juice, then go to town on getting the shell off, proceed to dunk your fingers in the sauce at the bottom and get a nice coating on the shrimp and all your cares of getting messy and if anyone is staring at you go out the window. Hubs was surprised at how much I loved the meal. With the appetizers, I definitely wasn't able to finish all my shrimp, but that just means I get to savor it again for lunch tomorrow! I immediately called my mom when we got home and told her we HAVE to take her and my dad there next time they're on our side of town. I really wish they were coming over this weekend, so we can go back. Two very messy thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Blown away as soon as we entered for our first time. Loved the atmosphere and the staff were prompt and polite. We were quickly seated and our server Nicole came by and asked if we'd been here before and when we informed her we were new she enthusiastically went over the menu options. She knew what to recommend based on what she had. 
We ordered and when the food came...OMG 
Totally satisfied."}
{"text":"I was thrilled with the fried oysters and will go back to try more. It is pricey but we are in the desert eating fresh seafood. My wife was so so about her meal at the price. I found the service to be attentive and friendly. They were very helpful with first time customers and took the time to explain how to negotiate their menu."}
{"text":"The food here was decent but it was fairly pricey and messy. It's a very traditional crab boil establishment which I liked but if you are expecting a several course meal this is not the place for you. Their gumbo is out of this world!"}
{"text":"Awesome place and the seafood was really good and being from New Orleans they have Abita Springs Beer,,, Awesome,.... and also its the headquarters for my hometeam New Orleans Saints Football so Saints fans Sundays is where it goes down here!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place blows the socks off any other seafood place in town. Fresh, fresh, fresh. And since it's fresh it comes to your table super fast.
You buy by the pound and type, then you order seasoning and heat level. Comes in a steamed bag that you dump on the table.
We had snow crabs and muscles. It was wonderful. I will definately be back!!!"}
{"text":"seafood are market price and i think is over priced.  in my opinion, u can buy double amount of seafood and cook at home.

i have the chicken wings, not bad, it is fresh fried, but the sauce is a bit too salty and very oily.  the sever give us couple different sauce to try the spicy level, but, to me, not spicy at all.  the server is very nice...tell us things on the menu, explain each item, etc."}
{"text":"First timer & hooked. Had a pound of Shrimp & a pound of King Crab legs, both in Trifecta Sauce at Medium. Delicious and spicy, next time will get mild sauce with side of medium. The dozen raw oysters were amazing too - plump and juicy. Kevin took care of us. Finished the meal with chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream. Very, very messy; no plates, no utensils - so worth it!"}
{"text":"Angry crab: a lifetime experience!! We've celebrated birthdays, engagements, home comings and pretty much any excuse to visit. It can be a bit pricey but the food is a religious experience! You have to try this place, period! Don't think about it... Go!!! I love trifecta level 2 with shrimp and don't forget to ask for lime and salt. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"First time here. First let me say that our wait person was awesome. The food that we did receive was wonderful and cooked properly, (not over or under cooked.) 
Now, the hostesses do not seem to have a clue how NOT to overwhelm a section and my husband's meal never came out."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to visit since they opened so I was really looking forward to dinner. We were sat quickly but 15 min after being seated, no one had come to take even our drink orders and the waiter for the next table was not looking at us... I asked someone if we were supposed to order somewhere else and I think he was the manager so he took our order. It seemed like a pretty long wait to get the food but luckily my daughter's cod and fries came out fast and they were really good. I had snow crab with trinity sauce at level 1 and even that was pretty spicy (the Cajun seasoning likely) but delicious and Messy! Hubby had Mussels with the same seasoning. At one point we ordered extra rice and fries but I think the fries got lost somehow. After we had our food (-and drinks from the manager), the waiter from the next table over came over and said he was our waiter after all and apologized. We ordered one more serving of crab but it took too long so next time I'll order it early. The food was good. We made a huge mess but I guess that's the point! Konrad saved the day by serving us when we didn't have a waiter. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, so much delicious food! Servings are huge. So much food we couldn't finish it and that is rare. My husband and I both got baskets... fried shrimp for me and catfish for him. We also got a side of hush puppies. The shrimp were large and fresh, fries and potato salad tasty, and good dipping sauces. We will definitely go back!

The only big issue we had is we walked in and ordered food to go. It was not busy and the hostesses said it would only take about 10 min. The Cardinals game was on, so we were perfectly fine with that... Fast forward 25 minutes later and nothing. We walked up to the hostess to check in and she informed us that our food would be at the bar once ready. She never told us that before. We had been sitting right in front of the bar and right next to the hostess station while our food had been sitting, ready behind the bar, for who knows how long. The food was still warm, but not piping hot. The service could have definitely been better on that!"}
{"text":"one place to chose to eat while in town and had to try a place that had seafood boil! our waitress was very nice and service was good. they had heaters outside on patio so we opt to sit there. 

okay so the seafood is pretty much the go to, but when you add bbq to the menu cmon how can we not try it! i will say i eat spicy but i only got a level 2 and that already had a kick to it. so choose wisely.

pros: the ribs (very tender)
          trifecta sauce (very flavorful) 
          shrimp (big size) 

cons: crawfish (frozen, not good taste)"}
{"text":"Newbie seniors enjoyed excellent service from Kevin & another supervisor who stopped by to address one of guests who has an allergy
 to black pepper. The atmosphere was fun, and the food was excellent. Good selection of craft brews. We'll be back for sure; and we wish them luck in what has been a tough location for previous tenants."}
{"text":"I love Angry Crab. Fresh seafood, fast friendly service, and good beer. How can you go wrong. I used to go to Joe's Crab Shack (which is good, don't get me wrong) but this place blows is way better. Fresh seafood is the best. I can't verify it but someone told me the Angry Crab has all their seafood flown in fresh daily. It is definitely fresh and definitely good. If you enjoy crab and getting your hands dirty go here now!"}
{"text":"Yummy for my tummy.... I give it a lot of thums up!!!! The seafood is delicious as always, this place is quiet pricy just know that you about to spend $$$... not kidding lol All their flavors ate good!! When they say  Spicy.... ohhh its spicy... don't even risk it if you gona cry about it later, its not your average hot sauce in a bottle Family friendly, love the fact the kids can draw on the paper laid out on the table... too cool for school kind of stuff!!! And they got sinks out in the restaurant out in the open so you can wash your nasty crusty hands... hahahaaa... enjoy the food and don't think about it too much, just don't forget your wallet!!!!"}
{"text":"Had the Snow Crab, w/trifecta sauce, and added sausage to the bag. Messy. Delicious. Happy Hour beers to complete the meal. Perfect ending to a long week. Sat at the bar and Jeff the bartender was great. Very helpful to a newb and not pushy.  My only complaint is that I am too full to try the bbq this time. Jeff gave me a sample of the brisket which was mouthwatering and tender (just not smoky). Don't be deterred by the hidden location, the food here is legit."}
{"text":"I'm not a big seafood person, but my friends are. I like fish, so I settled on fried cod basket. It came with 4 large pieces of fish, plenty of Cajun fries, and potato salad. The potato salad was okay. The Cajun fries were fantastic, especially with lime squeezed over top. The cod was great, no bones, very tender. Honestly, the target sauce is the best part. Not the classiest of places, but great quality and quantity for cheap. My friends got the crab legs. They come in a bag with seasonings and meat scissors. They both seemed quite pleased."}
{"text":"4 stars and not 5 because I've had better. It's by far the best in the area, I especially like their tamarind seasoning. The atmosphere is hella loud. I do not get why there's a wait when there are tables available. The service is ok, though there are plenty of rooms for improvement."}
{"text":"I have yet to eat at this specific location, but the one on Guadalupe and Alma school is....ohhh weeee yummy yummy. Fresh, flavorful, and worth the wait & price!!"}
{"text":"Angry crab shack is really such a fun place to go! We went for my friends birthday dinner and he couldn't have had a better time. The servers are all super fun and did a great job. I got the fish and chips and it was great you could totally split it with someone! I was also a fan of the sauces! I got a level 5 Cajun to dip my fish and chips in and it was great! If you like spicy don't be scared to try the level 5 it's perfect. It is not a very good place to go on a first date because of how messy the food can be and it is also very loud! They blow this whistle or something like every 3 minutes. It get pretty annoying till your 3rd beer then you don't even notice it! I would recommend going with a group of friends!"}
{"text":"Was very good and both my wife and I enjoyed our meal. A couple of small things that took away one star but we'll definitely be back.

What we had...

1 lb King Crab
1 lb Snow Crab
1 lb Shrimp
Corn, Potatoes, Sausage

Pros:

1. Crab, shrimp, corn, potatoes and sausage was all excellent.
2. Had Trifecta with medium spice and it was perfect.
3. Seafood seemed fresh with good flavor.

Cons:

1. I ordered 1 lb of King Crab Legs and only got two legs and a little body part. My wife got more crab with her 1 lb of Snow Crab. Her Snow Crab was easier to crack than my King Crab. Not to mention her Snow Crab was almost half the price of my King Crab. I'll get Snow Crab next time. Seems like the heavy shells of the King Crab are what I paid double for.
2. A bit expensive.

It is great to see a place like this in the West Valley and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful family dinner that pleased all my family from grandchildren to grandma. Great food and fun environment for family outing. We love seafood and they have something for everyone.

Just like eating at an east coast crab house, where the roll out paper on table and you enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"This is everything you expected to be and more. You create your own boil in bag lobster or several kinds of crabs and  pick your spiciness from mild to blow the top of your head off.   I felt like taking a bite out of a gator.  Tasty tale gator nuggets. Come prepared to get messy."}
{"text":"I finally am able to come here. First time I tried to go was a weekend and the wait was like 2 hours...My friend and I went on a Tuesday so it was less packed. I was running late so she ordered for us....1lb shrim and 1 lb mussels (they didn't have crawfish :( ..sad day) and she ordered it in trifecta spice..

It was pretty delicious...it was pretty spicy but unlike HotnJuicy on my first time it was less spicy...so more tolerable..Their fries were very good. The rice looked super dry but it ended up pretty soft...

Def ask for salt pepper with lime to dip and break down the buttery spice of the shrimp and mussels...

The atmosphere is very casual, their walls are covered in writing, for a cool vibe...It gets a little bit loud but fun! There was 3 times that a loud bell type thing rang for birthdays (it was really loud). Their dining room is pretty big. Ooh and they have a sink at the back of the restaurant so you don't have to go to the rest room to wash your hand when you are done!

Pricewise..it's pretty close to HotnJuicy.

hmmm idk which one I like better...have to go to both more times :)"}
{"text":"I still love this place. And I still will go. But they to need fix one big hiccup. We frequent this place almost once a week. As other reviewers have stated their service had been lacking but it seems like they're starting fix a lot of things the more we go. People complain about the clumps? It doesn't faze me. In my opinion it's where all the flavor is anyway. Went there today and service was great and our server was extremely friendly. The only downside is we had a gift card but I guess the manager wasn't there and no one knew how to input it? Thumbs down! It wasnt too big of a deal for us since we knew we'd be back anyway to use it BUT for those who are relying on using one for their meal... I guess make sure the manager is there first before you head on over?!!? Or it could really ruin your meal. They definitely need to get that sorted out."}
{"text":"The crab is about 2x as expensive as what you can buy from fry's or costco and make it yourself, but doesn't stop me from buying it here. I really enjoy the catfish. It's 10$$ and comes with 2 sides. It's a large portion as well. Love the ambiance and the staff."}
{"text":"The shrimp, raw oysters, alligator and hush puppies were very goood!  No plates was cool, just paper on the table and go for it.  The staff was friendly and polite!"}
{"text":"Omg I love this place! I ordered the shrimp trifecta style! So amazing!!! At first I felt it was pricey but then I received my bag of shrimp and WOW! The shrimps are huge here!!!! I've been here 3 times already and will continue to do so(: only recommendation I have is they should provide moist wipes after hahaha"}
{"text":"Food is off the hook! . Great super-casual atmosphere. Went for lunch so stayed away from the steam pots and tried the basic cod basket. Excellent. Can't wait to go back and dig into some steamed anything with the trifecta!  You forget your land locked it's so good and fresh."}
{"text":"This was super overdue, but we FINALLY got a chance to go back to Angry Crab Shack. Unlike our previous experience, this one was absolutely AMAZING!!! The estimated wait time given to us was about 40 minutes so I grabbed a margarita from the bar, but it ended up only being about 20 or 25 minutes. Our waitress came by soon after to grab our order. I got a pound of shrimp, head off, with 4 pieces of sausage in medium trifecta sauce and a piece of cornbread. My boyfriend got a pound of the vegetables with 4 pieces of sausage in hot trifecta sauce and gumbo. It didn't take too long for our order to come out; everything was piping hot and looked absolutely delicious!

My shrimp was so so good. I'd say that medium was just the right amount of spice for me .. spicy but not too spicy with a lot of garlicky delicious flavor! The sausage was kind of an after-thought, and next time, I'd probably skip it just because the shrimp was so much food! Surprisingly, the vegetables were really good too. The bag had an array of different kinds including broccoli, bell peppers, even some pineapple, as well as ones that we actually didn't know what they were. I love cornbread as it is and thought the one here was phenomenal. It was more cake-y than what I've had at other restaurants, which was fine. It was super moist and had a bit of sweetness. My boyfriend who typically dislikes cornbread thought it was good too! Lastly, the gumbo was super tasty. It was thick and chunky with lots of little shrimp, pieces of sausage, etc etc.

The prices here for a pound of seafood are pretty fair. The next time I return though, I'd most likely be inclined to order just a big bowl of gumbo and cornbread.

Our waitress was really attentive during our visit. She made suggestions for food, came by to check on us, grabbed us refills and our check in a timely manner. Like I said previously, this experience so great, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place. Its my new favorite. Food is great. Servers are friendly and attentive. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place! I always get the trifecta level 1. I've had the level 2 but it was too spicy for me to enjoy my food. The service is always very good as well. It can get packed on the weekends but that fine by me!"}
{"text":"Geez. Maybe TAKE OUT ORDER'S are not one of  this eatery's forte. We enjoy dining in, but the last two take out orders have had items missing from it!!! It's so frustrating! The initial time that this occurred, we went back to pick up the missing items. This second time I was not willing to go back for the missing items, so I called and the friendly nite manager, Dion(sorry if I misspelled), kindly credited a small portion of our order back into out bank account. Expediting to go orders needs to be triple checked."}
{"text":"Not impressed with our visit.  The service was lousy and the restaurant was very loud.  The food lacked seasoning and the seafood was not cooked properly.  The staff is still going through some changes.  I would probably not go back to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Omg!  A Cajun shrimp/crawfish/lobster/etc boil in Phoenix?  What a great discovery!  Wife had the lobster, I had the shrimp and gumbo.......oooooo weeee....I Gaurantee!!!!
Goss stuff!"}
{"text":"This is was my first time at this specific location. I was having dinner with one of my friends and we ordered 1 lb shrimp, 1 lb mussels (with corn and sausages) Cajun fries, and a dozen oysters- trifecta seasoning! 

The food came out in a timely manner and it was delicious. I like this location better than the one in litchfield because the shrimp was perfectly. The one in litchfield is always over cooked. 

Service was great and our waiter was really nice."}
{"text":"Went here Friday last week for the very first time. It was very interesting. I love me some SHRIMP. It was so flavorful and delicious! You can have it as mild or as hot as you want. The waitress was always making sure we are good keeping up with our drinks. It gets pretty busy."}
{"text":"YUMMY food.  Hush puppies were a little on the spicy end for me but the shrimp-in-a-bag was cooked perfectly.  I'd definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Our waitress Shelby was incredible, she was funny and led us through our first dining experience at this restaurant. The food was good, and while it takes a lot of effort to get a good amount of meat. You should not leave feeling hungry."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum. I have been here a handful of times now and have never been disappointed. I always get the shrimp (they are huge) in mild trifecta sauce and add sausage. There is a huge variety of what you can order for your main course and you can add potatoes, corn and/or sausage for an additional charge. I am a wimp when it comes to spicy so I get the mild but it still has a little kick to it. You pay by the pound at market value. Shrimp is probably the best value for the money, $12 per pound. The one pound is plenty of food for me. My hubby order the lobster once and thought it was delicious. I know that on the weekends, they tend to run out of certain items, so that tells us it's also amazing.

Here and there I order cajun fries as an appetizer.  It's got a great spice to it and comes out perfect. I like to munch on them before my shrimp make their way in that delicious trifecta bath. This review would make me hungry but I just some Angry Crab Shack shrimp and feeling very content right now."}
{"text":"****First this needs to be said ....  I have without a doubt the BESTEST monk EVER!  About time you knew that monk!!!!  Best part is she loves me back, you know how amazing it is to be truly in LOVE with your best friend, she is different and she is family ....   I want to marry this girl .... Shhhhh - she doesn't really know it ....  Ok with that said WHAT she doesn't like seafood, but because she loves me and this location has BBQ .... I get me some  legs waaaaay more often.Before experiencing, and yes it is a experience, the Angry Crab I don't know what I have been eating all these years as it sure wasn't crab as THIS IS CRAB!!!!!!!!!  I get the 1lb snow crab, and their market pricing is great as well, with trifecta medium and yes please throw a few red skinned potatoes and corn in there as well ... soaks up all that delish seasoning ... YUM!  AND best part ... they have BBQ here too so if you have those non-seafood friends ..."}
{"text":"Had an amazing meal with my wife last night, at The Angry Crab. We had the snow crab, shrimp, sausage, corn and potatoes. Everything was perfect.
Our server was exceptional. She was so nice and helpful. Her knowledge of the dishes, seasoning and spices helped so much. Thanks so much Judy for the awesome dining experience!!!"}
{"text":"The food was great. Remy took care of us. I had the shrimp trifecta,  hot. It was fantastic."}
{"text":"I use to really like this location but we have had two really bad experiences.

The first time we went in during the week no one was at the front so we waited and the guy at the bar seated us. We sat there for about 20 minutes waiting. As we sat we talked so I didn't really notice exactly how much time has passed until I looked at my phone. I tried to get someone's attention but it seemed like they were avoiding us. Even the other customers notice and made eye contact with me trying to look at their server. Eventually we just walked out, I was too upset to even think to ask for a manager.

 The second time I was with my parents and yes, I went in a few times after the first incident giving them another try. My issue was with the service or their lack of. We sat down and no one came for a while then the lady who seated us got us our drinks. Eventually our waitress came and took our order, then that was the last we saw of her until the end telling us she was leaving. We would have to ask other worker for drinks, gloves and bibs taking them away from their customers. I get that they are busy and/or short staffed but I have been to this location so many times and it has been getting worse each visit. Yes, the other workers did help and bring us what we asked for but it still took them a while and one guy just left us the pitcher of water so we didn't have to ask anymore. I was just upset on how everything happened. 

We live about 30-45 minutes from there, the closest location to us is on Litchfield so this place was worth the drive to us. But I have been disappointed too many times by this location, and we have been there more than you can count on your fingers and toes. So, it is sad that we will not be returning to this location, hopefully time will past and they will have better service."}
{"text":"I really like this location my family and friends are huge fans of Angry Crab! My favorite is a pound of shrimp trifecta 3 sometimes with potatoes and corn. The only down side to this location is that they don't have macaroni. Yes I know that the bbq locations have it but it would be amazing if this one could have it as well."}
{"text":"We meet around 12:30 pm  on a weekday for lunch. We ordered shrimp, dungeness crab and homemade potato salad.  The steamed bag of freshly cooked shrimp came first.  It was better than average.   The dungeness crab was smokin' hot!  (Not the spicey hot but temperature hot! The way I like my food!  It was a messy meal to eat but tasty. The service was attentive and very friendly that day.  Besides the $42.00 + tab just for my crab - (which I estimated it would be) it was an all around good experience!  (Just when I saw my portion of the bill compared to my companion's  $12.00 shrimp it hits you a bit harder!  :)   )"}
{"text":"The Trifecta sauce is heaven-on-earth. One of my favorite things to order is the giant shrimp, with some sausages and corn thrown into the bag. Nothing like diving into the steaming bag with your bare hands, taking in the spicy aromatics, and ripping off the head of a massive prawn. I used to struggle with getting the shells off, too. Don't worry, one day your hunger will develop the skills you need.

This is the first place I tried a Dungeoness Crab, and the waitress took the time to explain how to eat it. I didn't opt to suck out its brains, although I now live in regret and wonder. I also tried mussels here for the first time, and holy cow they are delicious! I never knew! This whole time I'd been sticking to the clams and thank goodness they ran out of them the night I wanted to order a second round!

Also had the king crab & snow crab here. Typically I prefer the sweetness of snowcrab, but the meat sort of get lost in all the mess of sauce and slipperiness of fingers. I'm a messy eater, though.

The whole experience of this place is fun. The atmosphere is great (you can write on the walls!). The service is always friendly and fast and you never have to wait that long for a table even though they are always packed. Getting messy is part of the fun, and you're definitely prepared with your butcher paper table cloth and plastic cup of Kiltlifter."}
{"text":"Me and my bf and parents went here as an impromptu birthday dinner (my mom came home a day early from Ireland) and this place was good. Bf and I had a pound of snow crab legs that came in a bag of sauce, I had the trifecta, which the waiter said it was their most popular, and he had the pacific rim. They supplied us with tools to quickly and efficiently get meat out of the shell (we were given scissors as well which helped a ton!) But it still took us a while to really finish it, and not let any go to waste since it was 15 bucks that night. I also wouldn't say this place is autism friendly (I'm on the spectrum and I have really sensitive hearing) because they have a loud blaring siren that goes off annoyingly whenever someone orders a level 4-5 sauce (ghost pepper and scorpion!!) And birthdays.. unfortunately like mine. But the cheesecake I had was delish. I wanted cake but I was only offered a rootbeer float or cheesecake (which I presumed was free but I saw another birthday table get a chocolate cake slice and I think they paid for theirs..) but still that was really good cheesecake. If I got more used to that loud siren I'd go here more often but I'd rather go somewhere that's more quiet for crab like Joe's."}
{"text":"Love this place. The gumbo is to die for and overall just a great atmosphere to have a night out. We have been to other locations that were over crowded, this one is now our weekly stop."}
{"text":"OMG, this place is awesome! Ordered the two pound special and the two of us could not finish it. Tons of great food. Good atmosphere, friendly attentive wait staff."}
{"text":"I travel a lot and each state I visit I must dine at a seafood restaurant. Well, lo and behold, someone recommended this place (I can't thank them enough) we had a rather large group, 6, but Jeff handled us well, He explained prices and how to expect our food arrivals, and he was very attentive. 
The food was excellent!! Best fresh seafood I've tasted in a long time and the boil & spices that they obviously cook the food in is delicious!!! Not one person could resist the amazing smell and taste of those crab legs. (You receive a rather nice portion)
The only complaint.. The half & half (iced tea and lemonade) tasted like water. Everything else was fine.
Also, I would like to thank JK (waiter) that took over Jeff's shift, he was helpful as well."}
{"text":"Great place, great food and atmosphere.  Be prepared to get messy so don't wear white out anything new lol."}
{"text":"Yay... this place is really fun with good food... and the only place that I'm aware of in the area that does food like this. Worth checking out..."}
{"text":"Average food. Very cool interior. Has been quite a while since I've worn a bib to eat. Nice that they have gloves to dig into your bag of goodies!"}
{"text":"Loove Angry Crab Shack! I've been to several different locations in the valley and they are all equally delicious and awesome! The seafood is fresh and tasty. I especially love how fun and messy it can be. My friends and family love this place. We always have a blast when coming here! Love that you can also write on the walls, it is just so much fun! Awesome food and staff! I definitely suggest it to anyone."}
{"text":"My daughter loooooooves coming here. Waitress was super friendly and food came really fast. Almost TOO fast!! Lol. It's seafood so that was almost a red flag for me. But it was really tasty. The shrimp will get you the most bang for your buck! I did have an awful tummy ache for a lot of the night. Not sure if the spices were too much or something didn't settle well."}
{"text":"What a fun atmosphere! A little loud but was such an easy going laid back crowd. Great to let loose after a long week! 

The most fresh seafood and only steam bags I have had in AZ! I love fresh seafood and this place including crawfish and oysters are delicious! Our waitress, Deb gave both my husband and I the perfect suggestions! I had crawfish in the pacific rim sauce, which was a spicy coconut curry butter sauce. A little different but so good! My husband had snow crab in the trifecta sauce, which is more traditional steam bake butter sauce! 

Overall, great price, great food and a great time!"}
{"text":"Came here with family for lunch today for my birthday. It was finger-lickin' delish!

We had 2 orders of the Frog Legs (they were big compared to the smaller ones I've eaten), Clams, Crawfish (were big as well), Shrimp, Calamari (for apps - the best), Crabs and Catfish with fries and rice.

My order was the Clams - Trifecta. I guess I said Medium instead of Mild so it had a major kick in my mouth and my sniffles.. So I couldn't take it but overall it was good! First time for me here and def. coming back!

If you like seafood. Come here! There weren't alot of people because it was early lunch when they opened around 11am when we came so that's good. Service is great!
The air fans were all on, so it was cold inside. But me saying medium instead mild put a kick in my mouth. So my day was hot and cold lol

There was a $20 deal. Forgot what came with it but really was worth it!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. It would be nicer if they accepted reservations on smaller parties for our wait time was probably 30 minutes. Also it's very loud in there between the music playing and the conversation roaring and the birthday greetings screaming it's hard to have a conversation. But I guess we were so busy trying to eat the food that was placed in front of us that we didn't mind screaming a little bit to be heard at our table of three. Our server was really nice and made sure that my husband didn't see the preparations for his birthday cake surprise and I really appreciated that.  I will have to give them a four out of five simply because the noise was pretty bad but I do recommend their food. It was great!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time for happy hour , we live in the neighborhood, ordered the shrimp cocktail, very overcooked shrimp, hard as a rock, ordered the pork sliders, they were okay, ordered the kettle chips thinking they were home made, they ripped open a bag of chips threw some pieces of pork on there and threw barbecue sauce and there you have, it we will never go back there, very disappointed!"}
{"text":"On a date night with my girlfriend, we decided to try this place out as we'd heard great things about it and after giving them a call and hearing that there wasn't a wait yet, we hustled down there.

We were seated right away and didn't think much of getting seated less than ten feet from the kitchen.  This should have been a tip off that the night would be headed downhill.

We told the server (Jared) that it was our first time and he welcomed and explained the menu (not too difficult to understand).  We asked for a few minutes and after about 5 minutes, we were ready and 5 minutes after that he passed by and said that he would be right back.  He then proceeded to assist and serve the table behind us for another 10 minutes or so.

When we did get to order my girlfriend ordered the Blue Crab and he informed her that they were out of it.  Now, they either were out of it when we showed up and he didn't tell us or... they ran out in the 20 minutes it took us to get our order taken.  Strike one.

We both ordered a pound of shrimp with the trifecta sauce and a few potatoes and a piece of corn (they list the corn as corn on the cob but its more like half a cob).  We also ordered a piece of corn bread (pretty small but we were at least told this before ordering) and an order of mac and cheese.  The portion of the sides were pretty lack luster given the cost. Strike two.

They brought out my order and we waited for her order to come... and we waited... and waited.  It was between 15 to 20 minutes until they brought it out! During that time when we inquired about it we were told, \"It comes out when its done\", \"they're backed up\", and when the order finally did get there, the girl apologized because \"it was put in wrong\".  Awesome.  Strike three (wish we had gotten out of there).

We only saw our server once more before he brought the check and we were lucky enough to snag a refill.

All in all this was not an experience we will be taking part in again.

The food was decent, lot of work and a bit of a mess, but we did know that going in.  

We wished we had a different server (like the one that offered to top off the beverage when we asked for a top to go) like one that seemed to care that we were paying customers.

We really wanted to like this place but not with this service."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! This is one of the places I like to frequent, you can't go wrong with any item on the menu but I do in particular love getting the king crab and the corn. This place is unlike any other seafood place you've ever been to. I highly recommend trying this place out if you have never been before."}
{"text":"Had the snow crab with sausage and WOW so delicious and flavorful!! 10/10 would visit again and dinner was especially fun with friends. The atmosphere was nice and there were also options for those who didn't want to use their hands. Sandwiches, etc. are available too!"}
{"text":"Great food, always busy . eating crab is messy. Had clean up sinks in the dining area."}
{"text":"Frankie is the best server! The food was fresh just liked she promised and after 2lbs of crab, veggies & corn we are amazingly satisfied! Best idea ever: giving us gloves so the crab scent won't linger all day!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!food is great and so was the service. Be careful their hot is hot! My favorite spice is the trifecta#2"}
{"text":"Gotta love this place. Our party got the snow crabs, shrimp, crawfish, fried oysters, dungeness crabs, rice and corn. Everything except the oysters were excellent.  Especially the dungeness crab. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Love love Love! Angry Crab transports you to a different place where you're seaside eating your crab legs and shrimp. Love the bar staff and love the food!"}
{"text":"If you like to get messy, this is the place to be. Delicious sea food! However, I did not like the Buffalo wing po'boy because it had a small wing piece and a lot of bread. But overall everything was great! Amazing fries too."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and cooked to perfection in a rustic ambiance. Best place to go really hungry. The sauces are great and I have even eaten their hottest one although it isn't for the faint of heart. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Went to this place on good recommendations.  First, the seasoned fries were very good. We had the \"boiled\" crawfish and a shrimp poboy. I'm from South Louisiana, so I know what these things should be like. By now I should know better than to ever eat boiled crawfish that isn't fresh out of the pot. They must pre-boil these with no seasoning and then when you order they throw the crawfish and spcies in a bag and heat it up. Not good enough if you've ever had real boiled crawfish. It might work better with the other seafood items they have. The shrimp poboy wasn't bad tasting... just on a small roll that wasn't poboy style. It should be called fried shrimp on a roll.  A regular size poboy should be at least 8 inches and the bread is like french bread... not a gooey wonder bread dinner roll. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Po'_boy.  I'm sure this place has some good food, but for the $ I paid, I don't know if I want to spend more to find out."}
{"text":"March 25th we decided to try this place.  Seafood loving diners!  

To our dismay, the crab legs had these seed looking things stuck to them.  I asked the waiter and manager to explain and was told that means they are the freshest!  Like the best!  Its from 'shell' shedding.  Well I spent some time doing research before I posted this, because they really tried to convince me it was Like finding gold!  Ha!  

Okay people, if your seafood smells or have damage or discoloring it's NOT good.  This particular problem is that the leeches can survive cooking water and hatch in your stomach!

Don't take my word for it, but do your homework.  Restaurants are passing poor quality more often than not.  But making patrons sick should not be acceptable.  Hold them accountable!

More on the leeches so you can be informed.  Don't take owners/managers or other staffs word for it and spend the next week in the bathroom!

{"text":"Having only been to the Mesa location it was time to try their sister location. This location I heard from fellow locals said this location has been overturned around 6 or 7 times.  But I think this one is here to stay. 

There were the usual graffiti walls, booths, bibs, tvs, a and then the weird part - high top tables. The one the hostess seated us was at was a wobbly high table. And then there was a section that was empty due to no server available. Then I spotted a booth that was almost done eating. I asked the hostess if I could take that since they were done. And she said that other people were waiting 20 minutes for it and would need to go on the waiting list. I look around me and there were plenty seats available. Not sure what she is talking about. We decided to sit at the bar facing the 4 tvs puzzled to one. 

Glad we sat at the bar. Great view of the tv and center spot. Bartender was good and told us about the new items on the menu from the other location. New items: bbq meats, catfish, veggies $5, salmon with veggies $16. 

Went for the usual trifecta mild sauce with snow crab legs. The best!! Always pair it with corn $1 and potato $0.50 each. Tried the clams - which was okay because these were the heavy shells and tiny meat. Skip on this. Also tried the salmon with the lemon pepper sauce. Sauce was good with the veggies but bland on the salmon. Use the trifecta sauce for the salmon. Veggies included bok choy, squash, mushroom, fall veggies. I'd say the veggies were well over cooked. 

The couple sitting next to us were a fun couple to talk to. And btw, the bar seating was now full. When someone orders a spicy level of 6 the staff yells and announces it to everyone. Same with birthdays. A slice of dessert like double chocolate cake or red velvet cheesecake or root beer float to name a few is given to the one turning a year older."}
{"text":"For the most part the times that I have come here I have had good experiences.  There was only one time where the potatoes were undercooked and then this recent time that they didn't have mussels! 

The know: This place is high prime time during dinner time on the weekends with wait times up to a couple hours!! If that's the case they will take down your cell number and text you when your table is ready. If you come during lunch then you are better off with no wait time. You get a bib while eating and yours to keep. ;) a bucket to dump the shells. 

The Area: Picnic benches and tables are out on the patio area with misters during the hot season. Inside has graffiti walls and seats for you and your guests to write your mark that you were there. TVs are along the walls to watch the sports that's going on. When it's someone ones birthday they ring a bell and announce for the entire restaurant to hear. 

The Food: For a table of 2 I recommend getting a pound of snow crab legs (around $16)  and a pound of mussels ($14) both with the trifecta sauces (garlic, lemon pepper and Cajun) and mild spice. They have a new sauce, coconut curry which is a bit spicy. Then add 2-4 small red potatoes ($0.50 each) and a couple 1/3 - 1/2 sized corn ($1 each). A little rip off on the corn and potatoes but still worth the eat with the sauce and just a good combo meal with the seafood. Sweet potato fries ($4) are a good \"health\" food to add if you are still hungry or need options other than seafood. 

The Food (part 2): haha! I had to add this for separating my usuals and the other parts of the menu. Along with the main course of seafood (clams, king crab legs, crawfish, shrimp, blue crab, etc.) you can always get some fried foods like the po boy sandwiches, alligator, frog legs, and fries. 

The Price: Seafood prices vary during the seasons. Prices above indicate summer prices. The food is reasonably priced. 

The verdict: 4 out of 5 stars. Great casual place for a couple or for a group. Good for sports watching. A place to pig out on seafood and to get messy. So pull your hair back ladies and put out all 10 fingers men and chow down."}
{"text":"Your server writing their name upside down on the paper \"table cloth.\" Special bibs for all ages. Sports ready for the football games. Welcomes messy eaters. Paper tool box. All fun features for a good eating!

This marks the 3rd location of all the Angry Crab establishments - located in the same plaza as Starbucks. (3 down and one more to go). It's the Angry Crab and BBQ. Even though the BBQ part is \"newer\" addition to the original restaurant I was only looking forward to seafood!

Walked in through a mini hallway entrance to the hostess podium and the hostess walked a couple to their table. Waited for less than a minute and another host came out running to greet us and brought us to our table. One half of the restaurant was completely empty while the bar was slim and the west side of the restaurant was 80% full. All the booths were taken so we took at seat at the regular tables. Like the other 2 restaurants there was a washing station, TVs, paper \"table cloths\" 

What to get?? 

......BOLD signifies my faves........
Choose It: (by the pound)
- MUSSELS. SNOW CRAB LEGS. Lobster. Dungeness crab. Shrimp. Crawfish. Clams. KING CRAB LEGS. Blue crab. Catfish. Salmon. Vegetables. $5-market

Sauce It:
- Cajun. Lemon pepper. Garlic. TRIFECTA (all 3 prior). Traditional Boil. Pacific Rim (like a sweet coconut curry sauce). Sweet N Tangy (haven't tried) 

Spice It: 
- no spice. MILD. Medium. Hot. Angry Ghost. Scorching Scorpion. ( I never went beyond medium)

This time around our top picks for the day were King crab legs, mussels, shrimp, corn on the cobs (half sizes) $1 each. red potatoes ($0.50 each) all with the mild trifecta sauce, and an Angry Basket: fried soft shell crab that comes with seasoned fries $12. 

Samson was our smiley and super server who perfected his name written upside down and gave us our \"toolbox\" on out paper table cloth. Love that! A+

Fried Soft shell crab breading was a bit much for me. Everything else was yummy! Mussels were of decent size at this location.  

Overall 4 out of 5. Can't be angry with the Angry Crab."}
{"text":"We had the shrimp basket and the king crab legs. The shrimp was the best we've had in quite some time and the crab wasn't too bad either. The servers were all very friendly and quick. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"A definite must for seafood lovers,also make sure you sit in Shelby section great server.enjoy"}
{"text":"We are regulars here and the happy hour food and beer specials are awesome!  Xavier is the best bartender...he knows what we want and is always hustling.  We plan our visits around his shifts...he is a keeper!!!"}
{"text":"So I'm from Cali and this is like the Arizona version of Boiling Crab.  Of course, given where we are, I had already lowered my expectations in terms of seafood freshness and quality; but the rave reviews of fellow yelpers still pointed me in giving this place a go.

Convinced the fiancee that we desperately needed a date night, and off we went.  When we get there, our server (his name eludes me) was super nice and started off with the specials, how to order, etc etc.  I guess they have something called Mixed Mondays where they have a bag of crawfish, snow crab legs, and lobster (tail or claw - chef's choice) cooked in the sauce and level of spiciness you like with mixed veggies for only $22.  When asked, the server said it was roughly about 2LBs of seafood.  Having never had crawfish, and wanting to ease into the whole crab in AZ thing, this seemed like a good start.  We ordered it as Trifecta Level 3.

When it came, it was the same delicious flavor at Boiling Crab, but definitely right off the bat, the fiancee whispered that the snow crab wasn't as good as BC's.  Oh well, that was expected.  The crawfish were huge and very good and I scored in that my lobster was a tail section, quite large, I might add.  Having finished off my three crawfish and most of the delectable assorted veggies, I proceeded to start on my lobster tail.  But wait.  As I peered into the lobster tail hoping to find mouthwatering deliciousness that is lobster, I peered into emptiness.  Awwww... Feeling jipped, my fiancee had the server come over and take a look, explaining the situation.

As dumbfounded as we were, he apologized profusely and the chef himself came out to apologize.  He unfortunately did not have any tails left, but he said he had two monster claws for us if that was okay.  Though I preferred tail, I wasn't going to turn down claws and those came out quickly.  They were HUGE.  I had my babe crack those and waited in excitement.  At first crack, what could only be described as white gunk came spewing out all over the table.  What the... he gave me a look and I was like... I don't know... He peeled away a section of the claw that broke off and I looked inside.  Well at least there is meat!  But to be safe I turned it opened side down to see what that white gunk was... And a torrent of it came glopping out.  Now, I may not have eaten lobster that often, but it was kind of nasty.  I won't lie, I was definitely concerned for my health!!  The look on my fiancee's face told me that it definitely wasn't normal for him either (and the dude worked at Red Lobster before for chrissakes).  So we called our server again, and again he was extremely nice.  He said he had no idea/he's never seen that before and got a manager to our table stat.  She also said she doesn't have an answer, scooped some of that white gunk and said she'll find out.

She comes back and tells us that apparently when lobsters molt, they have fat build up under the shell and in between stages of molting, if the lobster was boiled, this would happen from time to time.  She also emphasizes that that is what the chef told her.  So my lobster claws were safe to eat, but she is quick to realize that I probably don't want to eat them anymore.  So she reassures us that no worries, that mixed bag is on the house.  And she takes away the lobster pronto.  

Aww, how nice of her.  Now that's service recovery.  Now throughout this whole process, I had told my baby that this mixed bag wasn't going to cut it for us, so he ordered an order of cajun fries, 1LB of shrimp Trifecta-3, and 1LB of King Crab Trifecta-4.  He also opted to try their cocktail section and got himself a Dixie Peach (which our server aptly called a Cadillac Margarita with some Peach Schnapps).  The food was a little slow coming out this time around, and there was prompting required for some of it as the table next to us who ordered after us got their apps before us, but other than that, it came out in acceptable speed.  The fries were MMHMM, and the shrimp was so worth every penny.  The fiancee ate his King Crab and again noted that it was just not up to par with BC, but figured this was the best he was going to get out here in Arizona.  And he liked his drink.  So overall, the customer service, the food, the whole experience went well!  We will definitely be back for the shrimp and possibly the crawfish; may have to be a little desperate for crab, but other than that, the flavor was awesome.  Go there for some seafood extravanganza!  It's way better than going to a buffet that serves mediocre crab... or Joe's Crab Shack."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch in a bad mood. After Shelby was through with me I was in a much better mood. The shrimp were delicious, she had all sorts of cool suggestions about dipping sauces etc., and all told it was a fun experience. Ask for her. You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"We aren't fans of the way food is served there.  It comes in a bag.  If you have crab legs it's very messy to have them in a bag with the sauce in there too.  Taking them out to crack and eat is awful.  Also unless you order otherwise French fries are served highly seasoned.  My husband had the crab legs and thank goodness I had the breaded deep-fried shrimp which was served in a basket.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Had the king crab with hot cajun and garlic butter sauce. Amount wasn't as much as I am used to getting, and would have gave this review 4 stars but I am giving it 5 stars because of the GREAT customer service from JEFF! I got the spice level of Hot but it was too hot. I can't believe there were 2 more levels above mine! I love spicy... i love kimchi, siracha, tabasco, all spicy things but I am going to get mild next time! Thanks again Jeff! Your company should thank you as well because you are the reason why I gave it 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great amount of food, a great place to try unique food example frog legs and other southern foods. I enjoyed the staff very helpful with explaining their food and prices, be aware it is a messy meal but absolutely delicious!!!"}
{"text":"one of my favorite seafood restaurant in AZ. Great crabs and clams.. It is bit expensive compared to other restaurants but common .. seafood is expensive in general.. anyways great place with great food!"}
{"text":"Wife ordered the trifecta seasoning with a 2 in spiciness.  I also had the snow crab legs and the trifecta seasoning hut with a 3 in spice.  Both were very good.  Get ready to get messy.  Food is served in plastic bags that holds al that seasoning.  I found this to be better than Joe\"s Crab Shack. A lot more flavor.  I wish they could make the Hurricane's like Joes but i guess we can't have everything.  It was a bit warm in the front of the restaurant so I  would recommend you ask for a  table towards the back of the restaurant where it is cooler. Our server Caitlin was great and made some great recommendations. I highly recommend it and we will certain return soon. We paid $63 for both our dinners and drinks and it included tip."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The king crab wad very meaty. I had the $20 bag which included king crab, snow crab and mussels.  The vegetables were a good assortment.  Upgraded the bag to include corn, potatoes and sausage.  Our server wss extremely attentive and our drinks were constantly refilled. 


The one recommendation I have is providing already shelled items for a small fee $5 or so.  I'm low vision and it is a challenge to get all the meat out if the shells.  Plus I'm certain there are others who don't like to do the work themselves."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVED this place! I started with some hush puppies and a pound of the snow crab in garlic butter, which was very good, but was thoroughly blown away when I got a pound of shrimp in the mild trifecta sauce! Huge huge shrimp, and the sauce was delicious! My friend had the clams and was happy as a....well...you know...
Our server was Judy, and she was very friendly and upbeat. The only negative was she forgot to bring out the sausage and rice my friend ordered with her clams, but remedied that right away, so it was all good. We had gotten there early on a Saturday night (5:00), and by the time we were leaving there was a good sized line out the door, so get there early or be prepared to wait.
We are already planning on making this a once-a-month girl's night out!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come to the Indian School location once or twice a month for dinner, and I had been looking forward to this visit all weekend. 
The food....was ok. They changed from red potatoes to russet potatoes (recently? tonight? Couldn't get a straight answer) and they were mushy and inedible. Waitress shrugged and said she didn't know they had different potatoes, manager shrugged and said \"I can comp the add on charge, if you want\". I know, we're not there for the potatoes per se, but the total lack of f**ks given put a damper on the whole dinner.
The service...was TERRIBLE. I don't know if Katie was having a bad day or if that's her normal pissy attitude, but after waiting close to 10 minutes just to place our initial order, we didn't see her again except for the time I stopped her to ask about those infernal potatoes. No refills on drinks, no \"can I get you anything else?\", nothing. We were there pretty early on a Sunday evening and it wasn't busy, so there was no excuse for the poor service.
The manager seemed to also be boycotting customer service, and our concerns were merely shrugged off. I saw him talking to the waitress after leaving our table, but when she brought the check there was no apology or anything. 
For what it costs to dine there, it was a very disappointing evening out. May be worth driving to a different location based on service alone."}
{"text":"Extremely expensive for what you get...

My 70+ year old mom and myself recently went here - just the 2 of us.  We ordered some crab legs and a dungeness crab (large), as well as 2 non-alcoholic drinks ($2 each).  Our bill came to nearly $75 (not including tip) and we both left hungry...   We could have gone out to another place that has seafood for far less money and saved the rest to go out again somewhere else at another time... My tip: do not go here if you are hungry - it will definitely cost you."}
{"text":"We came to this angry crab shack for a dinner with family, and I was highly disappointed. The waitress SHELBY seemed like she was just trying to rush us out of there and I felt embarrassed every time I had to ask for the simple things that should've been provided to us like salt and pepper. The food was not great either. TO TOP IT OFF when it was time to pay, it was 3 separate checks within our party, she was taking forever and when we looked back it seemed like the manager and Shelby were arguing, she was obviously angry and so was the manager, we're waiting and waiting, and she comes back to our table to brief us on what happened and she spoke so fast and made no sense but from what I picked up she charged someone else's meal on my card. So they go back to fix it and 10 minutes later comes back and gives us the receipt to sign she said the manger was able to void the payment since it was just ran and so and so. Also very specifically said I should see no other charge on my card besides MY meal, and she said If so give us a call, she tried to look for a card to give me but couldn't give me anything, she told me the managers name like I would even remember, I was fed up and left. I STILL TIPPED HER, I check my account a couple days later and SHEBLY double charged my card, I called Angry crab shack 20 times and the phone would go straight to voicemail. I live on 7th st and broadway, do they expect me to drive all the way over there for some answers? Luckily my bank helped me out WITH NO HELP FROM ANRGY CRAB SHACK, NEVER GOING HERE AGAIN!!!!"}
{"text":"Again another great dinner/night at this place.  Yumm Yumm yumm! We change stuff every time and it's the bomb! No left overs this time. Sorry kids! Oysters \"Yumm\". Crab \"Yumm\" clams \"Yumm\" potatoes corn and sausage Yumm Yumm Yumm. Drinks made perfectly! Miranda!!!!!! And I feel like we are catered too. Another \"Yumm\"! If you like seafood with a kick this is the place! Service! Well, the best! I think baby girl walked us through the process. Hello! Get your grub on! You won't be disappointed! 40 minute drive for us and all we think about is coming back and trying something new.  You guys are doing it right!"}
{"text":"This place is so good! Moving from the east coast, I never buy seafood in AZ. It's just not the same. My parents were visiting and we tried the Angry Crab because it was late and close by (honestly not expecting too much). It was delicious!! I can't wait to go back. The hush puppies were delicious and the trifecta sauce was amazing. I took it home for dipping the next day (no shame :)). My dad got the fried catfish and he loved it. I would recommend giving it a try if you love seafood and don't mind getting a little messy!"}
{"text":"First time here, so here goes. Take a good look at the prices on the napkin dispenser, and make sure you confirm the price for the main course! I ordered a pound of mudbugs, the price on the holder said $8.50 but I was charged 13.50! When I asked about it the server said\" oh, that's the price for the flash frozen crawfish\". Information that would be nice to know when you order!

The building looks like the same old abandoned Perkins!
But, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went for my best friend's 23rd bday dinner....Never heard of the place and disappointed I never heard of it sooner!

I ordered 1 pound of the snow crab legs, honestly forgot how exactly I had it ordered however I should have increased the level on spicy on the legs.
it was a party of a good 12 of us, small but cozy and plenty of laughs to be shared down the table.

Food was QUICK! DELICIOUS! also the deep fried oysters..MMMMM!
I need to stop reviewing this, it's just making me want to go over now, haha...."}
{"text":"I had terrible service here and it didn't meet my expectations. Maybe I will try it again one day if someone insists we go, but I wouldn't choose to go back."}
{"text":"The Angry Crab is fairly new to the Phoenix valley as recently as 2014. It has made a name for its self because of the lack of seafood options here. The draw to ACS isnt just the delicious sea food but the way its served. You pick the amount of food you want by the pound. Each type you pick weather it be shrimp, crab, mussels or clams is priced at market value. The food is then steamed with your choice of flavoring and served in a bag. You can also decide to add sausage, potatos or corn to the bag (Highly recomended). The food is simply brought out to you in a bag which you then empty out onto the table. No plates or silverware, you eat with your hands. I know, I know \"but thats messy\" your going to say. Bibbs and gloves are avaliable along woth a roll of paper towles for the clean freaks out there. What I like about this place is that its great for a group dinner because everyone can order something different and the food can be shared. If you love seafood this is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Loved this place! 
I came for crab legs and was not disappointed! Loved that the seasoning wasn't full of butter, the level one spice was perfect, steamed veggies were crisp with a flavor season that wasn't too salty. Tried the allegator and frog legs for the first time- good, but not for me. I'm not that into fried, salty foods though. Our service was excellent --thanks, Tim! Fun and laid back atmosphere, friendly service! Oh, and we got to tag the walls which was fun!! I'll be back! 
*wish they stayed open a little later..."}
{"text":"Everything is good. Great for kids, that don't mind getting their hands dirty. The prices could be lower. I love dining out and I don't think their prices should be as high as they are."}
{"text":"I've been here once, I would say the star here is the sauce.   I say that because they just throw a bunch of shrimp in a bag whole. You have to un peal the shrimp so it gets pretty messy.  Not my favorite place but it was ok, they had some good beer specials."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I'd eat here once a week if I could. I love spice, and they have spice. I love beer, and they have beer (and mules). It's always a safe bet to get a bag of fresh shellfish, but they're baskets are great as well. Being your friends, bring your family, and don't forget to wear your bib."}
{"text":"I'm very glad they opened up this location on Indian School Rd in Phoenix. Now we don't have to go to Tempe for this type of food.  I like the menu and variance in spices.  Best part of this place is the food and fun atmosphere.  As for the \"hipster\" trending staff - I could do without seeing nose rings, ear piercings, overage of tattoos, skinny jeans, etc... It is just a gutter image.   But, we do go back for the food."}
{"text":"The first place I've found in AZ in my 20 years here that truly reminds me of the seafood places I grew up with on the east coast.  Great, laid back atmosphere with wonderful staff (and the seafood was excellent).  We'll be visiting this place often!"}
{"text":"Today Angry Crab Shack displayed poor customer service. They closed two locations early w/o any notification to the public on their websites. We visited the Awatukee & Mesa  locations & was greeted with a sign in the door. I understand that you wanted to appreciate your staff but your customers are the ones who support your employees. I watched several customers walk away. Better communication was needed.  BTW it was my birthday, so you can say I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Interesting to eat off the table - I think my kids liked it! Food was good and I liked the hot trifecta sauce (or whatever it was called)."}
{"text":"Shrimp and any seafood in their sauces is great. Trifecta/medium and the cornbread to sop up the spicy buttery juices hubs
Loves the gumbo"}
{"text":"Very fun atmosphere and the food was really good and spicy!  We ordered brisket sandwiches and the sauce had a kick, the Cajun fries were SO yummy and oysters were huge! Almost too big.  According to the people sitting next to me, and most of the customers I saw eating, the crab is delicious.  Maybe next time."}
{"text":"First time having crawfish and this place did not disappoint! I was also really pleasantly surprised by how cheap it was since we had a good amount of crawfish and a few sides. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"First off. A big thank you to Kile for some great service!   She spent some extra time explaining how to order from the menu to some first timers in or party. Ordered from every party of the menu. Food came fast and it was delicious. Thanks again for a great dinner service!"}
{"text":"I want to update my last review. In August had a not so good experience but tonight Joe and Allison took care of us to ensure our experience changed. We travel from out of town and always visit Angry Crab. Had a great meal and experience tonight. Thank you Joe and Allison!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, but the atmosphere was really loud and our server appeared to be marginally interested in serving us. She explained the ordering process, but it was so loud, it was hard to follow her. She came to check on us once and that was it. We had a disappointing visit as we heard good things about the location. I think it is just not a good fit for us and what look for in a dining experience."}
{"text":"This place is really good, and fairly priced.  Our order got messed up but was fixed promptly.  I highly suggest the sausage and shrimp."}
{"text":"Love this place! Service us always great even when they are super busy! I am not one for spicy but I love the trifecta mild and it's kinda spicy for me! Just got back from there a little bit ago. They definitely need a seating area for people waiting! We were seated at. The table right by the door and when it started to get busy people were standing with their asses practically in our face so we took our food home!"}
{"text":"Great seafood, well prepared, friendly service and reasonable prices.  
It's consistently loud, it's consistently messy and it's consistently very good."}
{"text":"This place was poppin Saturday for lunch! We luckily didn't wait too long for the hostess to sit us down. The inside is pretty big and every single table was occupied! They also have a patio in the front!

The service was great! Every employee seemed to be happy with what they were doing. Our server was very attentive and made sure we always had what we needed. 

The food! It was delicious! Ordered two pounds of shrimp, two orders of Cajun fries, corn, sausage, potatoes, white rice, and two drinks!!!! The trifecta sauce is to die for!!! (cajun, garlic, lemon pepper) We ordered our heat level medium and it did get to be a bit too spicy after eating about the 4th shrimp! 

Prices are great! We paid about $40 for all that food! Food is DELISH!"}
{"text":"First time visit, not the last. This place was in a word, bomb! We ordered 4 different boils, 2 shrimp, 1 king crab and 1 snow crab. We got them with the trifecta and level 1 heat. The best seasoning I have ever tasted. Also got  red potato corn on the cob and the sausage in two of the bags. The orders came out fairly quickly. We opened each bag and dumped everything on the table (yeah, it's covered with heavy paper) and went at it. Fun and delicious experience. I especially liked the shrimp. They were huge and had a sweet taste that reminded me of lobster. The server was very helpful for us first timers. There are so many other things on the menu that I can't wait to try. You won't be disappointed but bring your fat wallet, it ain't cheap but worth the splurge! Several items are very reasonably priced though."}
{"text":"No matter which Angry Crab shack you go to, they are all awesome. Great food, great service! Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place was soooo goog. I thought they would skimp on the shrimp so I ordered frog legs for my appetizer, 1 lb of king crab legs, 2 pounds of shrimp, and the Hurricane drink. They gave me this delicious, huge,  very dense shrimp, and the king crab legs were excellent.  Since I got so much food I had the garlic butter, trifecta, and Pacific rim flavors with the heat mixed up. All the food was cooked perfectly. The batter on the frog legs were to die for.im definitely going back there ASAP"}
{"text":"I'm glad we tried this after hearing all the hype. It was good, but not really my \"thing\". So messy, really expensive for what you get and I was really surprised that at 1pm on a Sunday we were 1 of 6 tables.  Not busy at all."}
{"text":"I want to like this place. It's close to me.  I like their type of food.  However over three stops I have left disappointed each time. 

The food seems bland and served with no culinary enthusiasm. My wife won't go back so I have continued to give it second and third chances by myself. 

Cajun seafood is my favorite cuisine. I love fried oysters and clams!!!  I love a cajon seafood boil. I love spreading out newspapers and eating shrimp and crawfish. That's why I hope for improvement. 

The owner sent me a personal note after my harsh review. I admire and appreciate that.  I am editing the snottiness out of my critical review. I still think the food is average and could be soooo much better. But with management that is committed to listening and improvement, I wish them well and hope for the best."}
{"text":"I'm IN LOVE with this place!! First of all, you don't get plates or silverware---you just eat with your hands off a big sheet of butcher paper that's spread over the table (fun and messy!).

Second, the trifecta seasoning is OMG-to-die-for. But beware, their heat levels run hot; medium is more like hot. And I'm not a weenie.

The ONLY negative(ish) thing I have to say is their gumbo is not the traditional Louisiana Cajun gumbo I'm used to from my childhood, but if you forget it's supposed to be gumbo, it's tasty in its own way..."}
{"text":"This place is great! The pacific rim is awesome!! Kat and Kelly are super attentive... great atmosphere and great food!!"}
{"text":"Oh my belly! Food was just fantastic! Had king crab, mussels, some of the wife's snow crab, sausage, corn, and potatoes. Everything was so delicious, piping hot! The atmosphere was perfect, the service was above and beyond. Ask for Trey, the fella was on top of it, but so was everyone else. All kinds of people stopped by, even the hostess twice. Loved it, give it a whirl."}
{"text":"Delicious!  I would go again!  I had some calamari, crab and cod and it was great. It was a little loud but other than that I loved it."}
{"text":"We have been fans of Angry Crab since they opened on W. Cactus Rd. a couple years ago and my review states how wonderful the food and experience. My wife and I expected the same A+ experience we had enjoyed once again, but at the Goodyear location. Food, not the same. Atmosphere, not the same. Service not awful but, not the caliber of Peoria. Not much activity or energy. We were told that the bright tee shirts were being replaced with black and white uniforms. Thats cheery. Goodyear has a problem. Not just morale but management. On the other hand, the Peoria location has a manager, Dianna, that has been there since Peoria opened. Ronald Reagan coined the term \"Trickle down\". Upper management could learn from this. Too many fast (and bad) changes, chase patrons......and employees away."}
{"text":"I like the place when I first walked in. Seems like a very delightful casual atmosphere with large paper as place mats and dining trays. There were two wait staff which seemed to accompanying each table. Since this place is new I figure they were training but each added to the conversation of delights on the small menu. The prices were on the chalk board above us. The meals only come as 1 pound each and that is plenty. You can order mild to very hot spice for all your boiled meals. I will be going back but not ordering as much since I waddled out of there completely full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Ok, wifey wanted to try this place based upon reviews in a local magazine.  

The service was fine, but the experience started poorly. Our crab had to be sent back twice (on the advice of the server!!!) which is never a good sign. We didn't try for a third time!  Shrimp boil was ok, but the additional spices take away from the more natural \"Old Bay\" style seafood boil flavor that we enjoy.  

While the server was very apologetic and embarrassed , we would have expected the manager to come by the table to apologize at a minimum and to comp the meal at the maximum.  

I now know why the Crab is angry!!!

Im out!!!"}
{"text":"This is the second location we have visited in Phoenix. This visit was just as good as the first. The food was top-notch, the presentation was typical of a great crab shack, the service was excellent, and of course the dinner was exactly what we wanted. Our visit this evening was a celebration of Mother's Day and we enjoyed ourselves immensely. We will return soon."}
{"text":"Good food for an OK price.  I always end up leaving hungry after spending $30 or so on a few pounds of food just for myself and another $60 to $80 for my wife and kids.  

My main issue is they only have the \"fresh\" crayfish which is fine but is almost double the price of frozen.  They advertise both but when ever I end up going to here they only have \"fresh\" and I do not feel is worth the high ticket price."}
{"text":"We had the level two trifecta on shrimp, dungeness crab, and \"red bugs\" (crawfish). We also had red potato, corn, sausage pieces, wine, and a cocktail. 

My dish (the shrimp, corn, potato, and sausage) was so delicious. I will definitely return for this dish. My boyfriend enjoyed his crab and sausage. We both thought the crawfish was seasoned and cooked well, but it sure was a lot of work for so little meat. This is not a complaint about the quality of the food, merely a first-timers' observation about this type of seafood. Btw, after trying my potato and corn, my boyfriend really wished he ordered some of his own! :)

The wine was reasonably priced, only $4; but it was clearly cheap wine. This blind test was confirmed when I ordered a second glass (I know, funny; I still like the taste of Pinot Grigio, albeit watered downed, with my seafood) and the server brought the refill in the bottle with the Gallo label showing. My boyfriend's cocktail was a generous portion of a unique-tasting drink with a clear yet complex, nice, intentional flavor. It was $8, an average price for a generous portion of a fancy drink; and we both thought it was worth it.

Wearing old clothes is a good idea because it is definitely messy. Everything is served in the bag. You pluck heads off shrimp and remove insides from juicy seafood. Juice squirts. It is fun environment and experience.

At the end, they made a funny bullhorn style announcement about my birthday and brought chocolate cake. The cake was pretty meh, but the usual cost of $2 is more than fair.

We will definitely be back for shrimp, sausage, corn, and potato. I will probably want to try the gumbo.

Oh yes! We arrived by about 6 pm on a Friday night and they were sold out of soft shell crab for sandwiches, clams, and one other thing that we weren't planning on ordering anyway. It wasn't a big deal to us, but I can see some customers being disappointed. It also made me wonder why they didn't have these items so early on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Horrible experience, my food was burnt and my credit card got charged twice. Needless to say I would not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I love seafood, but this place didn't live up to expectations. Our service wasn't good, and we were told we might not get crackers to crack our crab with because \"they don't have many left\" ... at a seafood place?? 

But the food was pretty good. Decent seafood with a good spicy sauce. We had the calamari, too, which was more bread than squid. Tasted more like a mozzarella stick than calamari. 

Also, if you go with anyone who isn't the biggest seafood fan, the only other options are chicken fingers or a cheeseburger. 

I love the idea of this place, but I'd rather check out another seafood shack."}
{"text":"The Cajun fries were great! We both had a shrimp po boy and they were great too! The service was awesome. Our server was Ryan and he was extremely friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"Very casual atmosphere with friendly staff. Great seafood.  The Pacific rim sauce was good if you like curry. Brisket was very tender and everyone loved it. 

Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum!

Came to this location on a Monday afternoon for lunch. It was quiet, but nice, and to be expected for Monday midday. It was \"Mixed bag Monday\" so we went with that, with trifecta sauce and level 1 spice. It was perfect for me because I am not a spicy eater at all. The trifecta sauce is AMAZING! Highly recommend. The mixed bag includes snow crab legs, king crab legs, shrimp and assorted veggies. We also threw in a few baby reds. The bag was 2# and cost $25. It was a great deal for the amount of food you get.

A couple of things to remember:
-Others have said it gets super busy and I can definitely see how that is the case. Plan your time if you don't want a long wait.
-The waiters are FUN! Go and have a blast. 
-Be prepared to get messy. Your food is served in a bag, drenched in sauce. It comes whole...heads, eyes, etc. Be ready to peel. With your hands. 

I highly recommend this place and will return as much as possible!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner out with my husband tonight. Kat was our waitress she was so good her personality was so refreshing.   Met Kyle an aangry crab manager, such a nice guy.  The food was great as always..... killer gumbo.  Oyster shots....OH YEAH.  So glad Angry Crab is on the west side.  Weekends are really busy but tonight  (Wednesday)  was a little bit slower and relaxing.   We'll be back."}
{"text":"The service here alone deserves 5 stars. Our server Candice was extremely helpful and patient with us, we told her that it was me and my girls first time here and she explained everything and never made us feel pressured. All the other employees were also so nice from the different runners bringing you food and emptying your table to the one guy who put soap on my hand when I was having a hard time at their wash station, everyone not only works as a team here but they are friendly and make you feel like you're the only one at the restaurant.

The food was delicious! Not only are there a bunch of different options of sea food but you get a nice selection of sauces to go with it and different spicy-ness levels also. I had a meat platter of brisket and chicken and it was all so juicy and perfectly cooked. They sure did a good job of catering to our needs and this is a place we are going to be visiting often, I am planning on bringing my parents here sometime soon too."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!!!  We had shrimp pot and catfish basket. Excellent prices too. Josh was an excellent server. Thank you. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This is one our favorite places for dinner! The crawfish, crab and shrimp ghost for spice."}
{"text":"This past weekend I had my mothers 50 birthday there. 26 family members came and Angry Crab Shack was more than willing to accommodate us with the reservation I made. The food was excellent. I had their king crab boil, a lot of different appetizers. Everyone has different dinner options but everything was great!  Tim was our Waiter and he was more than helpful!  Thanks so much angry crab shack for letting me host my mothers birthday there :-) we will forsure be back!"}
{"text":"We went on Sunday for my mom's birthday. Nice casual atmosphere. Food was excellent. We ordered hush puppies which had a nice kick. My sister thought the spices she ordered for her crawfish were as good as some place she ate in New Orleans. I tried one of my brother-in-law's muscles. Never had one before-so tender and yummy. Guess what I am ordering next time! I had the king crab and ssusage. I ordered the mild spice and my nose was running. So good though. My nephew's gator bites tasted like chicken. He said he's had better. The baked beans that came with his were delish. Mom liked her fried catfish. Said it was cooked perfectly. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"We went to the shack for my birthday dinner last night. This second time at Angry Crab still gave us delicious seafood but the service and preparation was off. We were given our side of rice when our drinks came out, so it was cold and hard by the time we got our food. The traditional boil sauce did not have any flavor this time and our bag of veggies came out raw. When they brought us a new bag of veggies, they were then soggy and overcooked. Bummer. Just like last time, we again had to ask numerous time for the tools to crack open our crab. 

When we inquired about crackers to get crab open and a tool to devein the shrimp, we were told that they didn't have any available. I would think that a place specializing in seafood would have an over abundance of these tools in stock. On busy nights, hand wash if need be between dishwasher runs of the tools. The scissors we were given didn't quite get the job done. I kept asking different people for crackers four times and finally got a pair from a helpful gentleman who was checking on all of the tables. 

Once we were able to dig into the seafood, it was delicious! Steamed to perfection and the trifecta sauce garlic-tastic and tasty with a kick.  Mild spice still had me reaching for a tissue. The pound of shrimp seemed like an endless bag and quite a few snow crab in a pound as well. Still yummy and we will be back when they are less busy. Bummed about the service and some of the food preparation. :-(  Read my previous review for newbie tips and details about the food."}
{"text":"After going to many other Angry Crab locations, this one impressed the most. We went today (Christmas Eve), with hardly anyone there, no wait and friendly greeting. Our server, Barb, was fabulous. She was prompt, friendly, and checked on us just the right amount. Unlike the other locations, she brought all of our tools, bibs, bucket well in advance. We had all of our food within 15 minutes of ordering. Awesome. 

With this location serving BBQ, they also have sides that the non-BBQ locations don't carry, like mac and cheese. This thrilled us, as our toddler doesn't like the fish or chicken strip options of the kids meals but he LOVES him some mac!  It was flavorful and different with crumbles of some kind. The hush puppies are amazing, as are the Cajun fries (as always). Our table split snow crab, shrimp and vegetables in Trifecta mild (1 spice). It still has a kick and is such a tasty sauce. This location has a MUCH better vegetable variety, they give you more and actually cook it properly (always limp or hard/raw elsewhere). We also noticed that they double bag for the steamed items, which keeps away the gooey mess.  

As usual, if going for the crab boil bags, be prepared for a fun mess and have lots of napkins handy. Use the sink on the nearby wall to wash up afterwards.  Ask for forks if you get veggie bag. The only slight negative was being offered shrimp with no heads but not being told that it was an upcharge. It actually added a lot of flavor to have it off, as the sauce had a place to seep in. 

We look forward to heading back to this new location. Rarely are we impressed with newly opened businesses, but they are doing great!"}
{"text":"Wasn't crowded for a Friday after lunch but quickly started filling up. I was surprised at the location being so tucked away in Tukee at the end of Ray away from the freeway and rest of the major restaurants. Had the shrimp with trifecta mild and I have never eaten a shrimp without it being peeled and deveined...so that took a lot of work. All in all it was good once the meat was out so I won't order that again. However the red velvet cheesecake was wonderful. Next time I'll try the poboy."}
{"text":"I lost a ring last night, it was rose gold and It meant the world to me.... If anyone has it or seen it... PLEASE... Turn it back in... PLEASE!!!"}
{"text":"Seafood and BBQ at one spot!?  Whoever thought of this concept is a genius!!!  The pacific rim sauce was fantastic.  It's basically a light coconut curry sauce.  I would recommend it with mussels or clams.  And get fresh oysters, shrimp or crab legs in either the trifecta or garlic sauce.  They're a must!"}
{"text":"Come hungry and don't dress up. Local Phoenix chain for dinner. Lots of locals at dinner time. In a non descript strip mall. Nothing fancy. But oh the food is good. Seafood in the desert. Order the boil. Pick a seafood: shrimp, crab, crawfish, catfish. Pick a seasoning and a spice level. Order by the pound. They bring the boil in a plastic bag. No silverware. Use your fingers and dive in. They'll give you bibs and gloves. Rub the juice all over your face! It's that good."}
{"text":"You got to just love this place , I grew up banquet Style. I haven't been to a clambake since I left Rochester New York , and this kind of reminds me of a clambake brings back a lot of good memories great food great service great pricing"}
{"text":"Well I have to say this place lives up to its reviews. I've never experienced a restaurant like this, but I've had a lot of seafood in my time and this was absolutely delicious! I came with a large group and not a single person left unsatisfied. Our waitress, Gigi, was wonderful. In fact, every server, bartender, etc. that we came across was so friendly. Delicious food, great staff and such a unique, laid back atmosphere...we will be back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Whoever decided to mix Cajun seafood and smoked bar b que joint, on word: GENIUS! 

Next time I'm in town I will definitely try the bbq side of the house.

Happy eating  guys"}
{"text":"Very good food 

Very fun atmosphere 

Can get a little pricey and its all done by pound so depending and what you order will change how much food you actually get."}
{"text":"The first time at Angry Crab today, and I will for sure be heading back. We were a group of 7 on a busy Saturday, but had no problem getting seated and having someone take our order.

We tried a lot of different things, because we were wanting to see what everything was like. Fried shrimp and fish for the kids, boiled shrimp and crab legs for most of the adults. To round everything out, a shrimp poor boy, Cajun fries, sweet potato fries, frog legs & fried clams.

The food was good, especially the steamed stuff, but that came out before the kids food, and one of the fryers must be off because some of the fried stuff was great, and some of it not so great.

One final thing, they were out of the two beers I wanted on tap. So I had to settle for my third choice which was okay but not great.  

So for food overall, I would give them 4 1/2 stars, but because the execution was not great (out of things, everything coming out whenever it was ready) I rounded down and not up."}
{"text":"Fun, fast, and fabulous we had a great dinner at angry crab.  This is affordable and tasty seafood.  It is also nice that they have BBQ as an option for that one person who does not like seafood.  Planning are next visit soon!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here on a Sunday for an early dinner and it was super busy, but we got a table pretty quickly despite that. Our waitress was great at explaining the menu since we had never been there before, but as for being on top of things, eh. When someone orders crabs that come to your table whole, a shell cracker is implied!!! Hush puppies spot on, but overall, mediocre and while I may give it a second chance, I'm not really in a hurry."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! My husband and I devoured the snow crab with the trifecta sauce, potatoes, sausage, and corn. We had a great time eating and getting messy fingers!Adam, our server, and the manager provided fantastic service. My mason mule was smooth and tasty! The only downfall was the birthday horn. It was cool at first, but who knew there would be at least four birthdays tonight? Next time we'll request a table far from the horn! :-) Yes, there will certainly be a next time."}
{"text":"Really disappointed by the service. Called in and said we have 10 people coming in and asked for a reservation. They took our name. We drove from another angry crab to come here to find out that they don't have our name nor do they take reservations over the phone. Why then even ask our name? The hostesses didn't try to help. Not sure how they do business here but this isn't the right way."}
{"text":"5 years and this is the first time I had been taken to the crab shack. 
Hot levels are serious. 4&5 are for the risk takers. 

Tried the king crab and shrimps. With the trifecta sauce. Mind blown. Excellent food. 
It's a perfect imperfect way of eating food"}
{"text":"I was nervous about this place from the outside, (I don't frequent unfamiliar strip mall restaurants) but the food turned out to be amazing and the experience was so fun! I will definitely be back. 

They serve everything in plastic bags, that's it, just a bag plopped on your table, so I highly recommend asking for gloves and being prepared to get really messy. 

This is either the worst or best place to have a fist date, depending upon how much you want to learn about a person."}
{"text":"I went in, skeptically, along with my sister, neither of us having ever eaten crab before. Now it's our favorite place to eat and we're always looking for reasons (excuses) to go back and treat ourselves.

I absolutely love getting a pound of snow crab and a pound of king crab. Sure, your hands get totally messy, but there are sinks just chillin' out where you eat, so washing your hands doesn't require you to touch anything. It's quite convenient.

The crab is super tasty, and I want it right now as I write this at work, but alas today I'll settle for something not nearly as yummy."}
{"text":"My favorite place  to come for seafood. Great  selection, and delicious moscow mules. I always have  a good time and leave very full! Best place to get down and messy!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, very relaxed and offshore the food is excellent. I loved the garlic shrimp."}
{"text":"Love the drinks here but the food is also very good, I know this is a seafood place but you have to try the brisket at least once.  It is not at all dry and is fall of the bone good.  The staff is friendly and they have a great patio area."}
{"text":"Great family seafood place if you like shell food. Went there for my grandson's 14th birthday he loved it. Price was reasonable and the fish was really fresh for what we normally find in the desert."}
{"text":"What a fun place!!! Jeff, our waiter/bartender, made our experience much more enjoyable. The Trifecta sauce is by far my favorite and the snow crab legs are the best. We had the Crab Pie and it was amazing, too. I highly recommend taking out of town guests here..."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the service, but I did however really like the food and atmosphere. 

I was disappointed on my first visit to this location in Phoenix after having been to their chandler location once and being insanely impressed by the delicious quality and the service. 

Granted the Phoenix location had just opened up so hey we're probably working out some kinks. I ordered a beer which I didn't get until I asked where it was when the food came out. The server returned with a beer that was not the right beer and he said the beer I ordered was out so they gave me this one instead. NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE STYLE I ORDERED(IPA) I received some weird fruity witbier. I did not like it and they didn't have anything else I felt like drinking so I stuck with water. Also part of my order never came out nor was it ever acknowledged that it would not be coming. At this point I was over it and was ready to go. I'll try it again sometime but I just hope for better service when I return."}
{"text":"This is place can loud and rowdy and the food is delicious! I am always skeptical about eating seafood in the desert but this place had really good fish and chips! We also tried the trifecta lb of shrimp and it definitely has got a kick to it. My brother tried the king crab and it was on point. I'm not usually a fan of deshelling the crustaceans that  I eat but it was totally worth it!"}
{"text":"We've been to this place twice and each time has been delicious! We love seafood! 
We order the trifecta with #3 spiciness and it is a perfect combination of flavor and spice. The service has been great both times as well."}
{"text":"Going to round up to 5 stars on this fun and exciting place. Been wanting to come by here for a long time and finally made it. Even brought my better half to crack some shells and slurp down a nice plate of raw oysters.

Inside is set up with everything you need to make a big mess and get crazy. The tables are covered in white butcher paper and they give you some goofy crab bibs to give your wardrobe some style. Nice!

Ordered a dozen of Oysters on the half shell to start. They were delicious and came with some very spicy cocktail sauce. My wife does not usually eat oysters and she managed to eat a few and enjoyed them thoroughly.

Decided get a pound of both Snow Crab and Crawfish. We did the trifecta sauce and went with a spicy level of two on the crab and a three on the crawfish. Even had them toss in a couple of the Andouille Sausages to kick things up a notch.

Service was extremely friendly and most helpful. All the food we ordered was delicious and a special treat. They said that the seafood is flown in every day and that is what keeps it so fresh tasting.

The menu has several other types of fish and seafood. They also have baskets of fried goodies and plenty of sides. Even saw some Alligator Gar Fish on the menu. We used to catch them in the bayou as a kid and hang the bleached jaws up as a souvenir.

Should plan on taking your time and not being in a hurry. There is some effort involved in getting to the meaty parts of some of the items. They will give you the tools and even show you some helpful techniques.

Definitely plan on coming back and trying out more of their catches. Be prepared to get a little saucy. It is so addictive that we could not keep our hands out of the bag. CAPTAIN ON DECK!

5 STARS"}
{"text":"Everyone was super friendly and the food was amazing. We went to the Goodyear one and our waitress Kelley was awesome!"}
{"text":"The best place for Cajun style seafood everything is delicious but my favorite is the shrimp with the trifecta! But you can't go wrong with anything that you get from this place ! It's become one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Yum! Service pushed this place over the edge- Marisol was awesome! My husband and I are on a very specific diet so we are super annoying at restaurants these days. Marisol made awesome recommendations and substitutions. 

We split a half rack of ribs and they were juicy and tender, even though we didn't have any sauce. Then we each had a pound of garlic butter snow crab legs. YES, PLEASE!

Great place if you're following a ketogenic way of eating, but don't come here expecting great veggies. You WILL get great service and delicious protein, no doubt!

And if you're bored, draw something on their walls! Our food came out really quick but we made it in before the dinner rush. We have come when it's busy and there can be a wait, but it's worth it for fresh crabmeat!"}
{"text":"It has very good seafood and seasoning not fishy at all great service and nice tables and waiters I have no complaints and I reccomend very much"}
{"text":"I loved my Louisiana Traditional boil with mild spice. I had the King Crab,corn,potato and vegetables. Crab was sweet and tender. I was really surprised the variety in the vegetables, it had every variety and fresh! It was so nice to enjoy a delicious meal that met my no fat dietary needs. The service was pretty good, they forgot my utensils and lemons but had no problem taking care of it, quickly. I would totally go back, again and again! My husband got a sausage po boy ,he said it was good but wasn't worth $11 . He loved the hush puppies, he said it was homemade . He also had fried clams  and said it was absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I have made it a goal that every time I leave the state of Utah I will try and see if that state has a Cajun crab boil spot. Of course Arizona had one and this place did not disappoint. Utah bucket of Crawfish still is #1 in my heart but this place is a solid 1.5

The fact that you can get king crab legs and lobster just blew my mind.
We ordered the snow crab legs and the crab was just amazing! The sauce was good but I still love my crab boil location (in Utah). 
Beware the spice though. I cant take super spicy and the mild was very spicy for me. 
I would like to give this place 4 stars because we also ordered the fried catfish basket and it was not good at all."}
{"text":"Was very fun and messy had lots of fun. Had a pound of Crawfish and a pound of Shrimp."}
{"text":"Food it's ok. Nothing out of this world... 
the 3 meat platter was good until I tried the chicken, not savory at all. The shrimp was good and flavorful. 
We didn't have a very good experience about it. You got to try it yourself!"}
{"text":"This s place was filthy.  My view from table was a grease splattered dirty window into the parking lot.  We got king crab shrimp  and vegetables corn etc.  it came boiled in a bag and the bag comes to table in dirty looking bucket.  You struggle to open bag then dump it in table which about the grossest.  I wouldn't have bitched if the king crab wasn't so over cooked and if anyone cared.  I don't normally eat shrimp with their legs still attached and eyeballs staring at me and also not deveined so I had to do all that at my table myself which is disgusting.  I ate 2 and then I just didn't want it because it was not even good.  So we left all that crap on the table.  The crab legs so over cooked they were $30 of rubber but of course she didn't come back to Check till the bill came.  We kept trying to get her attention but she was having conversations that looked intense.  When she asked how it was I said crab completely over cooked no saving that and she says I'll let them know right away then just comes back with bill.  I won't go back and I posted my receipt for my stalker Riggs,that accuses me of trying to get free food because I left a bad review of wildflower in Tucson."}
{"text":"Candice our server was awesome and so was every single staff member we interacted with- from the host to the runners and bussers, this place runs very well. Food was incredible as usual and we really had a wonderful time. Order the mussels, Mac and cheese, trifecta sauce with some cornbread! Good times, good life."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but the service ruined the experience. The waitress forgot to place 2 of our kids orders. 3 orders arrived for both parent and 1 child, the waitress acted like this was completely normal saying \"food comes out as it's ready\". Then 15 minutes later came back and asked what they ordered. We had to ask for refills then wait a long time for our check, she charged us for kids drinks (should have been included) saying \"my bad\", did not offer to fix. We will not go back."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed this place for the last 3 years. Today was my only problem, 3 pound lobster. Got home and started eating it, had no tail meat at all. They did replaced it and was very nice. But the replacement hardly had tail meat either. Will mot get lobster their again. Anything does is great"}
{"text":"My wife's favorite restaurant. We need to get our fix at least once every 2 months. Food is amazing of course. I understand it is not everyone's cup of tea. For Cajun seafood this is THE place to go. They have great sandwiches if you don't want the good stuff in the bags. Angry Crab gets really crowded but they still manage to keep up great food and service. We see the owner(s) there every time keeping everything on point. Their success and accolades are well deserved. The trifecta sauce is liquid gold."}
{"text":"Always awesome service and food comes out super fast. Everything we have had has been amazing, but watch out their medium is pretty spicy but delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Best Seafood fix in the valley!!  Nice Family Atmosphere and the calamari is very good.  Make sure you get the bread to sop in your spicy sauce butter blend served with your seafood.  You will not be able to get enough of this place....So many different items to mix and match."}
{"text":"This place is so cool.  I was waiting for it to open and now it is.  It has potential to be one of my new regular places.  I really appreciate the Dungeness Crab, hard to beat.  The crawfish is next on my list, other people say to try the shrimp.  There is a game playing from every angle.  Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Holy Yum! This place rocks. Service has been pretty average but I will keep going back because the flavor and food is soooo good. I get the trifecta and my bf gets the 5 on their spicy scale. Be ready to get messy--don't worry, they give you a bib."}
{"text":"Good crawfish. Rather small and relatively expensive for being in season. Nice atmosphere. They liked my service dog Willie."}
{"text":"I love seafood and this is the best in Arizona, not considering the finer steak houses in the valley.  Great atmosphere with an old Louisiana fishing hut ambiance.  

The menu is good size and there are a variety of delicious meal options.  We got 2lbs of shrimp with the combined three sauces, sausages, potatoes, and corn.  We also got fish and chips, as we just wanted to try a bunch of food.  

It was TOO MUCH food.  The portions are awesome, although you do pay for it.  The services was prompt and courteous.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality, the friendly staff, and the overall experience.

Any seafood or Southern/Louisiana style food lovers out there, this is your spot."}
{"text":"The soft she'll crab  was delicious, for being located in the dessert. Seafood by the pound on the boils is not bsd, based what's season it is."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here forever and finally convinced my boyfriend to. After today's lunch, we are definitely fans. I got the Dungeness crab with the trifecta sauce (mild) and he got the king crab legs with trifecta (medium). We also got some of the oysters and Cajun fries. I am stuffed...

It's a very casual atmosphere and located in a strip mall with Sprouts. The service was great and while our server did not talk much, we ended up meeting another server (I believe his name was Matt) who was super friendly and is an Eagles fan. My boyfriend is from Philly and a die hard fan. The next time we are here, we are probably going to ask to sit in his section. As we left, he yelled out E-A-G-L-E-S! And of course my boyfriend followed with EAGLES! 

Anyway, try out this place! Be prepared to get some very messy hands, plastic silverware and some really good seafood boil!"}
{"text":"Awesome seafood absolutely loved it!!! The legs have lots of meat and the trifecta sauce is to die first. Just plan on getting a little dirty as everything is done by hand. Absolutely loved it here. Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Food and services was horrible,  on a Tuesday night. Took my family to angry crab for dinner, food took awhile and when it's served, half of it was still frozen cold. We told the waitress so she was going to get us another full orders, but instead giving us new orders, she came out took our cold food to the back and warm it up and say it's hot now and that's what her manager told her to do. what kind of restaurants management is this? Make us wait for our cold food and still charge us for it. My bills was over $200 with gratuity included, paying that much at least served your food correctly and I'll be happy to pay but eating bad frozen crab legs and had to wait for it to heat back up. Not the waitress fault but it is for the owner and manager to correct this."}
{"text":"Ok first time to try this place ! I'd like to first give a shout out to our server Alysha she was top notch and explained how to order! The food was just ok and if you've never been here you have to work to eat! Lol crack all that crab yourself! Had my girlfriend went to their bathroom first
We would have been gone before ordering
She said it's the worst bathroom at a restaurant she's ever been in! Smelled like sewer overflowing trash and just generally nasty ! And FYI a pound  of king Crab
For 30.00 yielded one nice piece of claw meat
Don't bother with the rubberized fried clams and the burnt horribly doughy hush puppies! The shrimp we had served spicy were good ! Bottom line 
Horrible woman's bathroom
You eat with your hands
It's expensive if you're hungry 
Not a good value"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside of this place fool you!! It's worth to come in for dinner and enjoy steamy hot n spicy shrimp or anything you enjoy off their menu. I will recommend it here, way better than hot n spicy!! My kids also enjoyed the whole atmosphere and Mac n cheese as if they eat anything new haha. Be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!
Trifecta snow crab
Peach Dixie $10 delish but 
Would be better with bigger cups less ice"}
{"text":"This review is mainly about the service. The food was good, not great but good. The service however was one of the worst experiences I've ever had in a restaurant environment. Our original waiter came to the table wrote his name Caleb or something like that and said I'll take our drink order but someone else will wait on you because I'm getting off soon. Ok. Drink came promptly. Ordered food. Fist my meal came before my friends, hers came like 5 minutes after mine. It was awkward eating while she was waiting. Then we had to get up to get condiments. I had to go to the bar and ask for a drink only to have the waitress get me the wrong drink, then I had to flag her down to get my drink order right. Waiting almost 15 minutes just for the check to come, which we had to go to the bar and ask for. Can't make this crap up. It was terrible. There were people at the bar eating who obviously worked there jumping back and forth from one side of the bar to the other. It was crazy. Never seen anything like it. It was like a high school hangout session. I will probably visit the franchise again as there are some things I want to try but I will NEVER visit this location again. EVER."}
{"text":"If I had to describe Angry Crab in one word........ Flavor.Flavor would definitely be that word. My server Xavier made some great suggestions on the menu. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Four stars for the food alone. Service was not as attentive as I hoped. Dessert cheesecake wasnt great. BUT, the Snow Crab was delish! And the bbq was outstanding! So with that, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Order the Trifecta sauce with a side of salt and pepper lime to dip your seafood in! Yum!

I don't like spicy food so I originally tried 1 - mild and that was too spicy for me. I ordered a 0 next time and it was perfect -- full of flavor!

I definitely prefer angry crab over hot n juicy!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Loved the kajun clams. It is spicy. I order Thai spicy and it's 4th level spice was hotttt. Delicious. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place was a total dump when we came on New Years Eve. There were kids screaming everywhere and our waitress didn't tell us they were out of fries until after I had already finished eating the crappy shrimp basket I ordered. It was fun when I came here a few months ago, but I like at least a little bit of consistency and I would not risk coming here again."}
{"text":"Had a great time.  Food was bomb, service was great and so we're the drinks.  Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of seafood, so I went with the BBQ and it was gooood! I ended up getting the brisket with the Cajun fries and original BBQ sauce. The brisket was perfect and tender and their sauce was really tasty as well. 

Fun atmosphere and the staff was really friendly!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 30-40 last Sunday 7/2 for my husband's birthday. From the time I called to set up reservations until the time we left, everything was amazing. The service, the food, everything. I even called the day of to bump up the reservations by 1/2 an hr and to add 10 people. They just said we'll make it work.  We don't get good service these days without some sort of attitude or \"oh we can't do that\". Everyone was happy with their choices. I personally had the shrimp with pacific rim sauce. delicious! do not for get the hush puppies! We've been craving it since!"}
{"text":"We come in on Mother's Day at opening, to find out that the only BBQ they had available was brisket.  I like brisket, but being first time at this location wanted to get a multi-meat plate but no.  See we went to this location (we live much closer to 2 of their other locations) as I do not care for seafood and knew this would (should) have options for all at the table.  The server was good, but the kitchen was not so much.  (Different servers brought out the meals at different times - I REALLY dislike that!) So with the mixing of staff we had - Missing coleslaw, (my Brisket came with a piece of Texas toast) my cornbread showed up AN HOUR after I got my meal....??  Wife loved her bag of seafood, mom liked her clams and dad was OK with his catfish.  I honestly was hoping for better to give the seafood people options for when we all go out ... sadly, this probably won't be the place."}
{"text":"Food was great. We had the Dungeoness Crab, the Clam, the Shrimp, and the Lobster boils. The Crab was with Garlic sauce, the Clam had their \"trifecta\",(Kajun, Garlic, and Lemon Pepper),  Shrimp also had the \"trifecta\", and the Lobster was done in Kajun. All boils were delicious, and cooked right, not overcooked. We all got potatoes and corn on the cob, we also got the sausage. Potatoes were perfect, corn on the cob could have been better, but sausage was great! We started with Fried Calamari/Fried Clam basket. It was great. Calamari was cooked perfectly, and the seasoning on the batter was tasty. The cocktail sauce though was awful. Tasted like it was all horseradish. The service almost feels like an outdoor Clam bake where you need to go and tell the the what you need rather than them coming to you to check on you.  Otherwise, we all enjoyed it, even my 5 year old daughter."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight and I will definitely be back. Seafood and BBQ are on the top of my list of likes and they do them both great here. My friend and I teamed up to order apps and combos that included bbq pork, clams, calamari, cod and shrimp plus three tasty sides. Both of us were thoroughly impressed with all of it. The atmosphere was very comfortable too. I look forward to going back again and again till I've tried everything in the menu, especially for springtime lunch on the patio before a spring training game."}
{"text":"Excellent food, outstanding service! Eva was amazing.Very Happy staff on Fourth of July. This is where you come for great seafood in AZ."}
{"text":"ACS is great! This is the second time I had been here but took my brother who loves crab. We all enjoyed our food, the only critique is that there aren't really any options for people who really just want the flavor of the crab without any grill because the focus is on the different flavored boils."}
{"text":"Ok food, a bit overpriced. The service was ok as well. There were numerous times when my table would ask for something small, and not get anything for 15 minutes."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Reminds me of crab shack in San Diego. Wish this place took reservations... Otherwise food great and so is the service. Wait can be a bit ridiculous."}
{"text":"This place doesn't need anymore ratings but I gave them a 5 star on the food flavor alone. Yes, you will have to wait (a long time). Yes, the service isn't the quickest. However it is worth it! The flavor rocks."}
{"text":"We took a couple friends out for dinner and they suggested seafood so we decided on the Angry Crab n BBQ. This is not typically the type of restaurant or food that we choose very often, but wanted to be adventurous. The experience was fun but messy. You choose the type of seafood you would like along with the type of sauce and level of spiciness....you can also order vegetables in the boil bag as well.  We ordered the king crab which was meaty and juicy.  I would suggest ordering the bread to sop up all of the juice inside the bag which was really delicious and flavorful. They had a decent selection of beers that were reasonably priced. Be prepared for a shockingly loud siren to go off when someone orders the spiciest sauce or is celebrating a birthday. We initially happened to be sitting right next to the siren and almost fell off of our barstools, luckily we held onto our frosty beverages and they saved us!  Would rate this a 3.5 if I could. If Cajun seafood is your thing, you will appreciate this place so check it out."}
{"text":"A friend with a desire for seafood suggested that we visit this location for lunch today. The waiter first tried to seat us at a table with lots of hot sunshine illuminating the table. We had to asked to be seated somewhere where we would not be in the sun. We ordered the grilled salmon over rice with cole slaw and the the grilled mahi over rice with potato salad. When our meals arrived the cole slaw and potato salad were delivered with the wrong fish. The grilled mahi was pretty dry. The rice was a fairly large clump of dry sticky rice. Not exactly the type of rice that I can eat dry. I asked if they had any sauce for the rice. I was given two choices and was brought the \"sweet and tangy\" sauce. It was OK. When the waiter removed the sheet of paper from the table he spilled what was left of the sauce. When I got the bill I discovered that I had been charged fifty cents for the sauce that I thought should have come with the meal at no additional cost."}
{"text":"Yum! Almost as good my homemade. I enjoyed the snowcrab. When it wasn't spicy enough, they brought out hotter sauce for dipping. Hubby had the fish. It was moist and flaky. This Louisianian will be back. : )"}
{"text":"Great service food is amazing and atmosphere works. Bring friends family and be ready to get messy. Try the bag with your favorite and spice it up plenty big enough to share."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices and fun place to eat! Trifecta is the best seasoning selection but be careful on how hot you order it. The heat level can vary night to night."}
{"text":"Great fun place! Food was excellent, we had king crab and the shrimp. Sean was our waiter, explained everything very well and took good care of us. We will be back."}
{"text":"Some servers here are pretty awful and need to take a lesson on 1) writing down correct orders and 2) keeping track of what food's been brought out and what hasn't and 3) not arguing with customers when errors are pointed out.

Given that, food is still good. Will see how Hot and Juicy in Tempe compares."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite restaurant.  We absolutely loved the mussels.  Our entire meal was Fantabulous!!! Five stars with no question! Our bartender Kat was friendly, attentive,and had great recommendations."}
{"text":"If your in Arizona and are craving something similar to The Boiling Crab in CA then this is the place. Pretty much the same menu and taste. Love this place. You order by the pound and the shrimp are huge. Mild is still a bit spicy for someone who is a spice wimp but still tolerable. I got a pound of shrimp and a corn. Was delish."}
{"text":"Crap Food. Loud. Messy. Over Priced. Dirty. Weird Experience!  Yuk. My Soft Shell Crab was a Deep Fried Mess. Aweful Service."}
{"text":"This place is great. Would have been a 5 but they don't have key lime pie... shame on them. Highly recommend Monday's when they have the mixed bag! Just don't wear your best shirt as you'll probably wind up spilling something. Btw, Cassie is awesome!"}
{"text":"This could have started bad since someone stole the place in front of us. Once we sat our server Tre explained the menu perfectly.  We had the best seats in the house, right in front of the tanks of dungeons crabs & lobsters which I named \"Death Row.\"  My girlfriend ordered a pound of snow crab and a pound of vegetables with garlic flavoring and medium heat.  The heat really stacks on top of each bite one after another that reaches a fantastic presipus of flavor. I had the shrimps which seemed to be extremely healthy as they were cooked to perfection.  The medium heat will get your nose moving after a half pound of whatever you order. The food doesn't come out at the same time so if you order snow crab open the bag to slow the cooking down if you want to wait.  Overall a fantastic experience of plump, juicy, perfectly cooked veggies & seafood. Kudos we will be back for more"}
{"text":"I'm in Heaven!!!! As you can see from my profile - I love crab!  So this must mean I went to Heaven! 
We found this place from a quick Yelp search and we just happened to be in the area. Had NO IDEA how very popular this place is. Luckily we went right before the dinner rush because when we left the wait was crazy! People were standing on the sidewalk outside of the outdoor seating area waiting! 
**PREPARE TO GET MESSY**
Make sure you wear short sleeves or roll those sleeves up. Don't worry about looking silly in your bib - you'll look more silly with butter stains and crab all over your shirt. And maybe bring some lotion that smells good to mask the crab smell from your fingers because it takes a bit for it to go away later. I mean, if you care. 
Food is brought to you in plastic bags. You tear it open and dig in, savage style. Don't worry if you are not sure what parts you eat, the waitstaff is super helpful and friendly even through the madness. Our drinks were always full. Our waiter even cracked open our lobster for us after we looked curiously at it trying to figure out what parts were edible (he also tossed the \"yucky\" parts in the waste bucket, much to my dismay but to the delight of my husband and son ...I'm part Asian, you see...we like those \"yucky parts\"). The lobster was overcooked (chewy) but it had A LOT of meat in it. So we won't be getting that again. It was fun to take pictures with though. We had the King Crab and it was DELICIOUS! Fresh, full of meat and swimming in Trifecta sauce. We all agreed, though, that it might have been better with the sauce on the side. But still sooo yummy. I was, in fact, getting over being sick when we happened upon this restaurant so I am still mad at myself that I couldn't fit more in my belly. Fresh crab in the desert is AMAZING! Can't wait until next time. (We also ordered potatoes and corn...but I can't remember what I thought of them because all I remember is crab.)"}
{"text":"Angry crab an shack is a perfect name for this place because you'll leave here absolutely pissed off.  7 ppl, simple menu and they screwed it up majorly.  We had 7 people, 3 meals came out fairly quickly, then another about 15 min later, then another, and the last two didn't come out until we had to leave.  Not to mention the calamari wasn't ordered at all.  At one point, I got up and looked for a manager.  One waitress asked if I needed help and said she'd get him.  In the interim, the missing burger and fried cod plate hadn't made an appearance yet.  The manager came by, said he's sorry, there was a printer mess up and they're trying. He said he'd take care of the missing meal and he's giving us 15%off.  That was nice of him, but the waitress and the manager both didn't seem to really care.  Two of our party didn't have food, and as we were leaving, the burger came out and lol... it was COLD! Half hearted uninterested conversation about how it takes so much longer to make a burger....BS!!  Bottom line is, service, organization, and professionalism are severely lacking.  I had a much better shrimp po boy at Popeyes than at at this joint.  This is my second time at this place, and the second fail.  No time for a third mistake. I highly recommend NOT going to this place."}
{"text":"My wife have been going to the crab for some time now.  We visited the Awahtukee location this afternoon, ordered our regular which includes a couple orders of sausages with our boil, too our dismay the sausage was mealy and not flavorful at all.  Dave our server came around and inquired how our meal was tasting, I asked are they using new sausage, he said he would ask.  Dave returned a couple of minutes later and said yes.  We were just at the same location a couple of weeks ago and it had changed.

Suggestion- if the sausage is homemade, go back to your original recipe,  if you they are bought through a purveyor,  please go back to the previous brand.  I know if this new sausage is going to be used, I will not be buying them in the future.  Outside of the sausage, solid meal as always."}
{"text":"This place was great. The atmosphere was very fun. My sister and I went on a Sunday around 2PM. And yes, it was full. But we had good seats. The only negative was that they ran out of corn bread.....really??? That's a staple to the whole meal. I had read about how good their corn bread was in other reviews. So, that was the first thing I ordered. Only to be told that they were all out. Yes I will go back again."}
{"text":"Had a great first experience at Angry Crab with delicious food and an awesome server. Our server was Marisol and after saying it was our first time, she helped us with the menu and offered fantastic suggestions. We had snow crab in the trifeca sauce which was so tasty. We also enjoyed some of the happy hour appetizers for only $5. The fried clams were good, and the angry wings in the sweet and tangy sauce are our new favorite. I highly recommend Angry Crab Shack over Joe's Crab Shack and ask for Marisol!"}
{"text":"Food is great.   I like my crab legs.   The shells are crispy, easy to peel when they are crispy. Not soft and mucchie.  price is pretty reasonable.  I also tried frog legs and they were great."}
{"text":"Everyone should try the Angry Crab at least once.  Seated after a twenty-five minute wait that went pretty fast.  The service was pretty good for a packed restaurant.   Very positive vibe from both the staff and other patrons.  Fun place. 

The crabs and shrimp were absolutely delicious.   The corn and fries were good too.  A couple of disappointments would be they were out of cornbread (early Saturday?) and the coleslaw had zero taste and was, in my opinion, inedible.  

A great restaurant and I look forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"Such great flavor, and an amazing selection. Their prices are awesome for seafood, too. We love to come back here again and again."}
{"text":"It's a fun time. The low key atmosphere is great for a casual dinner.  I've had crab legs 4 times, figured out the traditional sauce is best,   DH has tried oysters, raw, shrimp and brisket, and happy with all.  The oysters are as fresh as I've had anywhere.  I'm not a fan of the corn on the cob, but, hey, I'm happy filling up on seafood."}
{"text":"If you like seafood with a twist, this place is for you. Don't dress to nice because it's going to be messy. You pick out what you want to eat, how much you want (it comes per pound) and how spicy  you like it. 5 of us went and we got 2lbs of shrimp,4 lbs of crab legs along with potatoes and sausage. We picked a medium spice which everyone liked. The food was hot, delicious and messy. The service was very good....plenty of bibs and paper towels to clean up afterwards. 
Can get a little expensive, but hey we only go once every year or so."}
{"text":"It's not just a meal, it's an experience!!!!
We're in town for two weeks and this was the best night yet.  
I love crab legs and it's been a while so I wanted to get the best so I did 1lb snow and 1lb King. The snow were so good I hated to finish them.  Add do the corn, sausage, and potato.  That was some of the best sausage I've ever had
Our server was Aaron and he was awesome
Highly recommend but don't wear your Sunday best because to enjoy it you have to get down and dirty"}
{"text":"I had dinner  on Sunday  . We waited 25 minutes  however  there were several  empty tables. Not sure why  the wait was so long. I tried the gumbo which was interesting  it had a lot of ocra which made the soup a little  slimy but it was tasty and spicy. We also had the fish poor boy.  Which was large  enough  for two . We had both the two star and the four star trifecta. Plenty of food and good service."}
{"text":"I gave them 5 stars because it is rare we leave a restaurant totally satisfied. We waited an hour for our table for 2 and we were eagerly welcomed by our server Evan. He was kind and got right to the point explaining the menu. Love that. Loved the atmosphere busy and full of happy eaters. My oysters were a wonderful treat followed by King crap trifecta #2 and some shrimp a little spicier!! Yum. Everything we hoped for!  And again big shout out to our server Evan!"}
{"text":"They tell you that their food is really spicy and that you should get one level down from what you think you want.  I did not follow this advice and got pound of crawfish heat level #3: \"burn your lips\" hot which was not spicy at ALL- in fact, my husband who gets spice level 0-1 at any restaurant even agreed that it wasn't spicy.  

We also got the alligator basket which was waaaaaay overcooked, dry, and the batter was dark dark brown and the fries were over seasoned.  There's no reason to put that much oregano on anything.  Ever.

The gumbo was good though and the first part of our order came out quick although not all together which was weird because my husband an I got the same exact thing except different spice levels.  His crawfish came our first,  then mine a couple minutes later, then the alligator basket didn't come out for another 15 minutes (I was already finished with my meal) and my husband thought they forgot the rest of our order.  He couldn't find the waitress to ask her about it.


I thought our waitress was really nice until the end of the meal when she decided to remove the paper tablecloth from the table WHILE my husband was still eating his alligator plate.  She came and just started removing the paper saying \"let me get this out of the way\" so we had to pick up our plates and drinks and food mid-chew while our tablecloth was yanked out from underneath.  It was extremely strange.  My husband said \"are you trying to rush us?\" And she said no and was very apologetic and sweet after that so I don't think she was trying to rush us after all but it definitely seemed like that while it was happening - I don't know if this is normal procedure or not but it felt very unwelcoming.  To prove that she wasn't trying to rush us, she took an extra long time bringing the check.  With the 30 minute wait to get in, we were there got 2 hours (this is on a busy Friday night)

They were very busy so people must love their food but we weren't impressed.

I did like the music though."}
{"text":"This place changed my life! The trifecta sauce is sooooo GOOD! THE service is awesome, food is amazing and I dont care to eat anywhere else but here"}
{"text":"Amazing food and Excellent Service !! 
We celebrated my Dad 50th Bday with the Family a table of 10. He got free cheesecake dessert and whole resturant singing. He had a blast.
The food where do I begin.....  I tried little of everything shrimp Po boy sandwich, catfish, salmon/white rice, shrimp boil, and crawfish Everything was delicious lots of flavor you can pick your spicy level. 
Be prepared to get dirty lol and licking your fingers 

Recommend it for Family and group of friends. Atmosphere is fun and loud. Adult drinks served"}
{"text":"So unprofessional. Ran out of crab claws at a crab shack. Bagged a rock. We thought it was a joke. Crab was less than a pound and came out cold. Manager offered free dessert declined offer. Manager avoided the table like the plague. Overhyped, underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Our first visit to the Angry Crab Shack was tonight, it will definitely not be our last. The service was excellent, Frankie was our waiter and she was great, always checking to make sure everything was good. We live on the west coast so are always looking for a good seafood restaurant when in Arizona. The Angry Crab Shack more than met our expectations. The 'Chard' oysters were amazing. The trifector sauce was great as was all the different dishes we had, between eight of us we had the shrimp, crawfish, Dungeness crab & King crab - it was all delicious.  It was also great fun digging in with our fingers and being totally messy! Thanks so much for a great meal."}
{"text":"My family and I gave angry crab a shot, personally I did not care for the like warm food or the general atmosphere. The servers all seemed like they had been working 15 hours straight. My wife and my daughter's thought the food was decent but nothing too great. I rarely leave poor reviews but this was not good. I also don't ever leave a poor review if the issue was because of a rude or disgruntled employee but this was by far an issue with how they run their company or lack of running their company. The owners need to get more involved and address their short comings or I do not see how they will survive in the restaurant industry. The only reason this is a 2 star review and not a 1 star is because it was not that expensive. I guess it works both ways you get what you pay for which is why this should be a two star rated restaurant."}
{"text":"We ate there for the first time on Monday. We went back on Friday. Dion was our server both times and he was fantastic. He answered all of our questions and was kind and funny without annoying shtick. I am looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to take my parents before the left to go back home.  We searched Yelp and all agreed that this place sounded good and most importantly, different.  We were very please.  We went at an off time, kind of between lunch and dinner and the place was busy, but not overly.  I had the crawfish, number 4 on the hot scale with the Cajun seasoning.  I was not disappointed at all.  My wife had the boiled shrimp with the same seasoning but a number 3.  My fault I forgot to ask for the heads to be removed and she was not to happy about that, but she was a trooper and dug in.  Again, very good.  My parents had the fried shrimp and cod baskets.  The portions were big and they both liked their choices.  Their only complaint was the Cajun seasoning on the fries (they don't do hot well).  We also had 1/2 dozen raw oysters and hushpuppies as an app.  I swear on my Yelp account (LOL) the best hushpuppies I have ever had.  The dipping sauce was very good as well.  So, 6 draft beers, 1/2 dozen oysters, order of hushpuppies, 2 lbs of crawfish, 1 lbs of shrimp, fried shrimp and cod basket plus the added sausage to two of the orders = $90 before tip.  Not bad."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to bring friends. But the whole eat with your hands out of the bag your food was steamed in just isn't my kind of fun. And my shrimp was over cooked and rubbery in the bag. There are other things on the menu that are okay, but I don't know if I would choose to eat here again without friends who haven't been before."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the most entertaining dinner you will ever go to! 
I would suggest for a date night! 

Wonderful food, and great people!"}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere, its fun and inviting. The food was delicious and the service was good. I wouldn't recommend this place for a large party as they do not accept reservations so the wait time is pretty long with a 10 person table. Also, if you have people that do not eat fish/sea food, be aware that their food will come out about 15 minutes prior to everyone else.
 
Be sure to wear the gloves that they provide otherwise your hands will smell like crab for the rest of the night."}
{"text":"Stopped by  on Sunday.  The place was not super busy  but they made us wait about 30 minutes. Our waiter  was Scottish  and were funny but had issues.  Ordered the jumbo . This was very sour and was not very appealing.  He forgot our order for a beer. He forgot our corn on the cob . They ran out of dungeonois  crab . We enjoyed  the shrimp . Fries were good . He forgot  to bring us s take put box. They did add tip . They only took reservations  if you have 15 or more"}
{"text":"It was a horrible experience! We ordered crab legs The waitress got our order wrong and brought out shrimp so  we waited 15 min then she brings out the snow crab and one of the  snow crab legs is cold like freezing cold so she takes it places another order for me, mean while everyone else is eating by the time time they bring out my order of snow crab everyone is done eating at the table and finally my food arrives right the 3rd time. Then we get the bill and they charge us a extra order of crab legs so we talk to the manager his name was Matt we expected him to be upset for the situation instead he knew all about the mistakes and didn't even apologize ! and said I will remove it but that was it and then they still were charging us a $28.00 tip. Try angry crab at a different location but not this one i would rather keep driving to the Mesa location"}
{"text":"I'm not one to write reviews. I've worked at a restaurant so I know how it can be sometimes. But this was the absolute worst service I have ever received at a restaurant. 
Food coming to the table as it's done? Alright. Fine. But when two people order the same thing, and one person gets their food and 20 minutes go by and the other person hasn't gotten their food? Something's wrong. And trying to bring out an appetizer after one person has already gotten their meal and is basically finished? Come on, now. 
Once we all had our food, NO ONE came to check on us. After at least half an hour, we had to flag a busser down to find our waitress. The place was not crowded while we were there so I don't understand. 
We had a party of 7. They made us write down our numbers so when she takes the order she knows who ordered what. That was pointless because it took three tries to get our bill correct. And we had to share who had what to the manager, who seemed like she didn't care about any of the issues we had and interrupted me when I was trying to explain our bills and the time we had there. I think her name was Olivia. 
I will NEVER recommend this location to anyone. The food was good so I would recommend their other location and hope you had a better experience than we did."}
{"text":"I love the Crab selection here, however I hate that I may be biased due to growing up in the Bay Area where Seafood is at its finest IMO. The pound of Shrimp in the Trifecta Sauce is on point and I like the fact that they give you the option of having Shrimp minus the Head.  If I could suggest any improvement, it would be to add a little more flavor to the sauce.  Other than that, I would definitely recommend having lunch or early dinner here."}
{"text":"The food here was really good, and I really have no complaints. Wasn't wowed by any means, but wasn't disappointed either. 

I will come back when I am in the neighborhood, I do recommend this place over Joe's but not over Hot and Juicy"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed going to this restaurant. You can find it in the far corner in the Fry's strip mall clear on the other end (that's East of Fry's is and behind the Melting Pot). The door is white and it's around the back. Now I know why everyone was parked over that way. I chose from the seafood side of the menu and had shrimp (they are huge prawns!), red potato, corn and it was delicious. Warning to New Englanders: this is Cajun spice so I ordered my sauce traditional boil (like old bay I was told) as a 1 and still thought the sauce was hot! I got the hush puppies too and they are good, but seriously spicy to me. I am glad I had a bib to wear and they provided a sink to scrub in! My dinner companion got the pulled pork sandwich, potato salad, and beans.This was all good!

The menu is awesome. You can choose off the Seafood or BBQ menu and your food will be delivered cooked in a bag, order a basket, Po boys, and there is a burger on the menu too. There is so much food on this menu I could spend a year ordering and not hit all the combos. 

The atmosphere was fun with TVs all around. I thought our server was very helpful. My advice is go and try it! You will be happy to eat here."}
{"text":"Horrible place to come for dinner. I would not recommend coming to restaurant that runs out of everything you want to order .   
First thing our waitress says to us is we have NO BBQ but brisket. We order mac and cheese for my 3 year old , waitress comes back and says we don't have any mac and cheese . 
How do you run a restaurant and run out of everything. 
First time coming to this place and will
Be the last."}
{"text":"My husband and I have driven by plenty of times and finally decided to pop in. First off, the smell alone gets ya hooked. We sat by the bar and our server was Rachael. We also had another gentlemen that worked there show us the proper way to shuck the shrimp. I cannot remember his name but when we go back I will be sure to get it. The courteous staff alone makes it worthwhile. The whole wait staff is fantastic and polite. They sure do have a great team. I ordered the clams boiled in the trifecta and my husband ordered the shrimp. The serving size is huge for such a cheap price. I cannot say enough good things. If you ever thought about going please do. We will definitely be returning customers. It was a superb date night!!! Thanks Angry Crab Staff :)"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place - and in fairness, the service was fabulous (great waiter) and beer was nice and cold.  But I went for the \"famous\" crab legs.  Maybe it's a Phoenix thing .... but I've never had a messier bunch of crab legs. 

We had a group of about 8 ... and started with appetizers.  The wings were barely average-served very wet.  The fried clams were excellent!  I haven't had fried clams in ages and as a New Englander, I've really missed them.  Angry Crab steams their food in bags and then the bags are served at the table.  We had two orders of veggies - Pacific Rim and Lemon Pepper. Everyone but me loved the Pacific Rim.  I couldn't eat the Lemon Pepper as they were swimming in so much butter I found them just a soggy drippy mess.

We also ordered two bags of shrimp and two bags of crab legs.  The shrimp were mealy and the crab clusters were exceptionally small.  And again, served soaking wet - over seasoned - and frankly completely overpowered what should be the natural sweetness of crab legs.  If I ever went back, I'd skip on their trifecta and see if just one seasoning would be less intrusive.

I know a lot of people love this restaurant.  But for me, heavy handed spicing and sloppy sauces doesn't make for great seafood.  Did I mention the beer was nice and cold?"}
{"text":"This place was bomb af!!!!!!! So juicy and so good!! 10/10, pepsi was poppin too!!! The potatoes were delish, the crab...delish. Everything.... delish! Me and my girl Shayla (in pic) are def coming back. Ohhh yes"}
{"text":"A bunch of us yelpers came here for a UYE organized by Arana W., and I had such a great time. The meal was delicious -- and very messy, which made it even more fun. I ordered crawfish and shrimp with trifecta sauce, medium heat level, with corn and a potato. The food was tasty and very well seasoned. It wasn't inexpensive, but quite well-priced considering the quantity and quality of the food. Service was very friendly and efficient, and there's a sink in the dining area for washing your hands; that's something you will definitely need to do before and after the meal. In all, it was a very pleasant experience and I look forward to coming back and bringing friends here. Nothing beats having a messy, delicious meal, especially with a group."}
{"text":"What a treat this evening was! A bunch of us yelpers met here for a get-together organized by Arana W. The place is spacious and bright, thanks to the big windows in front of the restaurant. It was noisy in a fun way with a very lively vibe, thanks in part to the enthusiasm of the staff who seemed to me to really enjoy their work here. I ordered a pound of shrimp with trifecta sauce, heat level 2 (the levels go up to 5, but the highest 2 levels are strictly for the very brave), with corn on the cob, sausage, and red potato. What a dynamite combination: big, sweet shrimp, some of the best I've ever had. The other items were perfect complements, all bathed in that glorious trifecta sauce. Upon Arana's suggestion, I ordered Abita Pecan Harvest to wash it all down ... excellent recommendation.  I'm so glad this place opened in Arcadia. I love Angry Crab in Mesa, but now I don't have to drive as far to enjoy a great seafood experience."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday instead of boiling my own crab at home or going to Joe's crab shack and was not disappointed. When I first arrived there was about a 20 minute wait and no where to sit to wait besides outside. The restaurant is not very big so a big party takes up 3-4 of the 20 tables available.( I would not recommend a large group) So that was a problem considering I was with my family and my grandma can't stand for very long. It was also extremely hot!!! We were sweating before we got seated. It was humid even when we got to our table. NO JACKETS ARE NEEDED AT THIS RESTAURANT.
 A waitress came over to tell us that she will start drinks while our waitress can get around to us. She explained the menu got us our drinks and then passed us on to our assigned waitress. OK that was not a big deal. It took our actual waitress about 25 minutes to come over to our table to take our order. I was starving. We ordered and our food came out not long after but it did not come out all at once. The lobster came out about 15 minutes after my 2 pounds of snow crab legs did and they could not find enough utensils for my table or the table next to us. For a seafood restaurant they should have enough crackers/rocks to open the shell to eat the food. The food was amazing!! I think the taste was the only thing that turned this expieriance from a one star to a four star and I am being very generous when I give it four stars. It was normal price for seafood but not as expensive as it could have been. Overall every one was friendly but it just seemed like they were not prepared for a busy night. 

Overall I will go back but ask for a different waitress this time."}
{"text":"I couldn't be more excited to have found this new place.   Food was yummy and prices very reasonable. Service was great and they even showed the kids the lobsters! Will be back and will certainly recommend to all the people I know. Felt as if I was in New Orleans :)"}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences I've had in a very long time! The staff is very friendly and seated my family of nine on Mother's Day in a matter of minutes! Food came out quick and was hot and fresh. Will definitely be my choice of restaurant over hot and juicy."}
{"text":"Great fresh seafood! Always great service and what you get for the money is unbelievable. Don't go go to the impersonator down the street!"}
{"text":"This is the go to spot for cajun dining in the valley.  If I'm feeling adventurous, I will order the seafood bag with trifecta sauce, sausage, potatoes etc., but I typically order the soft shell crab basket with a side of mac n cheese.  The cooks and servers here do a wonderful job.  I once saw a server de-shell 4 lobster bags for a family that was not familiar with this process."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing.. Our server, Harland, was awesome. The menu is unlike anything I've experienced and the staff was fun and on point! I went there for my birthday and I got a birthday cake (white chocolate raspberry cheesecake -- delicious). I really only leave good reviews when I have good experiences or extremely poor ones (so you will notice I don't leave a ton but I am definitely a foodie).. If you like seafood that's affordable with a great environment, this one is a must!"}
{"text":"I got a good review from a friend about this place and decided to try the place. Loved it. The service was awesome and hardly any wait time on the food. We just got there just in time before the evening crowd. We ordered the snow crab trifecta seasoning. The seasoning was so good. My husband ordered a dozen oysters both half grilled and on the half shell. The oysters were small but ok. My little guy ordered the angry edamame and the edamame were kinda small. The trifecta seasoning was the best and were craving it again. It's pricy but the customer service we got and the food we will be back."}
{"text":"Wow!  I came here with 8 people. I was told 15-20 minutes..... We waited 50 minutes.... There were empty tables everywhere....  Maybe they didn't have enough wait staff, however, I watched them seat more than 10, 4 tops while we waited. They could have made accommodations for us?  I have been here 5 times, I liked the food and would have thought they would treat there customers better."}
{"text":"Waitress was friendly. No wait. Got shrimp and sausage. Potatoes and corn heat level 3 and trio spice. It was all good. I'd drop my spice a level though next time and my friend said the same thing. It was a lot of food for what I ordered. The only negative is that I wasn't offered shrimp w/o heads but I dealt with the heads on."}
{"text":"Amazing!!?! Best food ever! Got the snow crab and garlic butter  and it was so perfect. Fun atmosphere- was packed for a Tuesday 4pm. Definitely a new place to come to frequently !!"}
{"text":"First time goer. My husband,son and his friend went for dinner and had a blast. The food and drinks were outstanding,we even ordered seconds on our food order. My husband said he wants to come next week and order something different.Thank you for a great eating experience"}
{"text":"Ok Ok so it took me long enough to try this place after a few people kept trying to convince me.  I'm glad we did decide to wait until they were about 6 months as I think all new businesses need to find their niche and how things will work for them.  Ok on to my review.

My husband and I decided to check out this place this past Friday night for dinner since we were in the area.  However we were not really dressed for this occasion as well let's just say we were in our nicer attire.  Next time shorts and tank tops or at least tops we don't mind if the seafood juice flies on them.

Have to give a shout out to the bartender, she was awesome, lovable great personality and knows how to mix a drink.  Too bad it was her last weekend for what ever reason hope they find a good replacement for her.  I had this Peach drink, can't remember the name off the top of my head but it was with Grand Marnier. 

Waited about 5 minutes for a table around 6:30 pm on a Friday not bad.  They have outdoor and indoor seating.  Hostesses greeted us promptly and were friendly.  Took us to our table.  They had a nice little patio with some tables outside but we sat inside. Noah or server quickly made his way to introduce ourselves and let us know how the ordering system worked.

My husband started off with oysters on a half shell and I ordered the hush puppies.  Oysters were good size and he liked them came out promptly.  Hush puppies could have used maybe 2-3 more minutes as they were still kind of doughy in the middle. For dinner we ordered 1lb clams, 1lb shrimp, and 1lb blue crab.  All Trifecta with a number 2 heat.  Perfect spices for us.  All came out hot hot hot and not spicy hot but temperature hot.  We also had a corn added to the bag of shrimp and clams.  It was also very buttery and flavorful.  We also ordered another round of drinks as well.  However we were so full didn't get to try any of the deserts.  We finished up pretty much everything with the exception of a couple of shrimp.  

All in all we had great service, really yummy seafood, and a great atmosphere.  Definitely going to be a return and as a matter of fact since our son's 8th grade graduation is Friday and our daughter is being promoted to 6th grade we are taking them this weekend as they both love them some seafood.

You definitely get the bang for your buck.  For everything we had minus the first round of drinks at the bar our food and second round of drinks came to a little over $58.00, that's a lot cheaper than some of the places we have visited and had terrible experiences. 

So being an East Coast Chesapeake Bay Gal with the bushels of Maryland Crabs and lots lots of Coronas I have now found a true flavorful enjoyable messy fun place to get my messy seafood & bib on!!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out because of all the great reviews but I have to say it was not what i was expecting at all. I have to point out that I spent a big chunk of my life living in the Mediterranean so I really love simple, off the grill, seafood or mixed with pasta and risotto, typical croatian and italian style meals. So if you are more into that then this is not the place for you. All the seafood was prepared in really heavy sauces that varied in spice and were pretty heavy on the garlic. Normally, I use garlic when cooking all the time but I dont like leaving a restaurant with my clothes smelling like im going off to chase vampires. The mussels were mixed in with really strong-flavored sausages, which kind of takes away from the beauty of eating seafood. The raw oysters were really \"meat-y\", it felt like I could almost choke on it and i sort of had to chew it pretty hard to be able to swallow it; all in all a very different experience. 

This is definitely a \"get down and dirty\" kind of place; they even give you gloves! Don't expect utensils or anything metal or glass for that matter, even the cups are plastic. Overall the environment is okay (if you disregard the screaming servers every 10 minutes or so). I give them three stars because, overall, the seafood seemed pretty good on rare occasions when I was able to taste it from all the sauce."}
{"text":"Always great peal and eat Seafood. On the spot service from Ben tonight. If you want an intimate and tidy meal, skip this joint... but if you want a good bang for your buck, don't pass this one up."}
{"text":"So Good! Seriously a must try! We had shrimp and mussels and the mussels were some of the best I've ever had! Staff and Service is seriously superb!"}
{"text":"If you're on your first date or even on your regular date night go to this place! 

We sat at the bar and the next thing we knew was that we could eat up there and save ourselves on the wait for a table (it was a 30-45 minute wait).  Plus, why not when the bartender (Lupe) not only makes you feel like family but will tell you the info that you need to know if you were a virgin at this delicious place!  

The food was beyond wonderful! I got the Spicy Edamame to start off the epic journey of food and finished with a root beer float. I don't have enough courage to whack any seafood animal so I took mine fried and my fiancé had the crab (which he loved the fact that they did have the normal tools to break it apart but the fun factor for him was when they gave him a rock to do it like the caveman)!  

The prices were reasonable and I was most amazed to see the MOD (Manager on Duty) took a complaint about the weight of crab legs and not only did she have it measured herself but she gave the guest some more pieces (but don't abuse this power just because I wrote this).  Amazing service and coming from the hospitality life I love when things like this happens! I wish there was an extra star just for her going above and beyond!  

Check out this place for the wonderful bartenders (my favourite will be Lupe), the amazing food and the great customer service! GO NOW!"}
{"text":"Went last night with the family, what a great place.  We shared the shrimps, clams and crab legs in the tri flavor.  Nice heat and kick.  Sausage was also delicious.  Hubby not a fish eater especially ones with eyes had the ribs, outstanding.  Root beer floats are a most.  Great staff. A fun place to go."}
{"text":"Used to absolutely love this place.  Then they changed management and the whole place went down hill. Whoever runs the kitchen now has no idea what they're doing.. ordered king crab with trifecta 2 sauce, some corn on the cob and potatoes. Took forever for our food to hit the table and when it did the crab was cold. Like.. refrigerator cold. This never happened under previous management. Even our waiter who was actually pretty great could feel how cold the crab was through it's shell. He took it back and when he returned the crab was hot but had no sauce in the bag... so again we had to flag down a server and ask them if we could please get hot crab with the trifecta 2 sauce like we ordered. Food was taken back again and finally returned the way we ordered it.  No compensation what so ever was offered for our patience or our long wait to fill our hungry stomachs due to their double mistake.  Very disappointing visit."}
{"text":"Once again the food made up for the bad customer service. How are you supposed to eat snow crab without a way to get it out of the shell? We skipped the crab this time because the waitress said the \" health dept.\" won't allow them to use the scissors anymore but you could use a plastic fork to process your crab legs...later we were told by a more helpful waiter that they were just out of them because it's busy (Fri night) understandable but not acceptable
 So a lie/ incompetence in the back cost the restaurant 36 bucks as three of our party got meals 1/2 of what the crab cost and the second strike of not coming back.
AND another big fail was that one meal came out nice and quick (the shrimp) but the other three in the party were a full 25 minutes later....and it was our fault the fryer was backed up apparently...

Waiting a couple of weeks but Three strikes and you're out...."}
{"text":"First time here and just loved the smell of garlic when we walked in. We got seated right away and the restaurant was pretty packed. Our server was very friendly and took the time to explain the menu. We ordered the King Crab boil totally awesome and some oysters Gumbo and gator bites. All of these were well seasoned and tasted absolutely perfect. Only negative on any food was the combo poor boy it needed some more wetness like maybe coleslaw in there but that's just me. Overall excellent and we will be back."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere, first time there.
Poor customer care services provided by the waiter Aaron. But the the greeter, Nick & other wait staff were great. WE SHALL return again."}
{"text":"I'm indifferent about this place. I don't love it and I don't hate it. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here though. I've been to some great seafood places. We came here with friends and it was fun but the beer selection was lacking and I wasn't impressed. I've been to places that had better seafood and the same concept so I feel almost spoiled by better places in San Diego, LA and Seattle. 

Although, if you've never been to one of these you should definitely go to just experience it."}
{"text":"Well I have heard how busy this place gets, so when Mr. M got home early from work on Friday, I told him to put on some old clothes and we were going to hit this place early to beat the rush.  We skipped lunch and got there a little before 4:00 so we were starving.  Autumn was our server to start with and she was great.  She took the time to ask us if we'd been there before and then gave us a rundown of the menu.  She also recommended the gumbo, which I don't normally try, only because I'd had bad experiences at other places in the past, and I'm so glad we listened to her.  The gumbo is rich and full of flavor.  Tons of tender little shrimp and pieces of sausage, and great seasoning.  Very nice.  I'm still thinking about it and want some more.

We also got an order of hush puppies which were really good, and had a nice little kick.  We ordered a pound of mussels, add sausage, trifecta mild style, and also a pound of shrimp the same way.  What can I say?  The 4 and 5-star reviews are spot on.  Everything was delicious and the service is great.  If there are restaurants out there that get complaints about their service, come spend some time here to see how it's done.  Every employee I saw was smiling, friendly, and helpful.  Some places just get that figured out.  They hire and keep good people.  At some point Autumn's shift was ending, and Kaitlin took over.  She was great as well.  

We got great happy hour prices on our beers also.  With 2 Abita Ambers and 2 Sierra Nevada Kellerweis, and all that food it was $46.75, before tax & tip.  

I only have 2 items that keep it from being 5-star.  First, there were about 7 mussels that did not open.  Can't eat 'em.  We were still full, but I wonder if that was a quarter of the pound that we were not able to eat.  And also, their credit card machines were down, so they had to do the old school card imprint forms which print the entire card number and expiration date on the carbons.  I wish we would have been given the option to use a credit card instead of the debit card that I handed over when we got the bill.  If those carbons fall into the wrong hands, then I have more protection with the credit card.  Next time, let people know before you grab the card.  It can make a huge difference if something goes wrong.  

And just a side note, to the people who complain they run out of stuff, A. it's a really busy place, that's going to happen, and B. I'd rather have them run out on occasion because then you know they keep things fresh.  The alternative is something I don't even want to think about."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised when we walked into the restaurant. Family friendly with a horseshoe bar in the middle! This location is quite large. We were greeted immediately upon entering by Taylor. 
She asked if we had a preference on seating, booth or table-booth it is! The walls are autographs of previous customers-fun to read!

Our waitstaff associate was Cody. Big shout out to him!  Personable, engaging and took the time to explain the menu. We ordered the shrimp basket and was not disappointed! Cajun fries were incredible ( ask for a side of ranch to enhance the flavor); shrimp were generous and cooked perfectly! You can select other sides to complement your basket.

We will definitely be back! Good job and nice addition to the restaurant repertoire in the desert!"}
{"text":"I counted down the days until this place opened. I decided to go alone one day after work and grab a beer and lunch. 

Their beer selection was impressive. They had everything from light beers to craft options. The bar was full and they didn't have any small tables nearby so I had to sit at a large high-top. The service was great with attentive waitresses that had a great attitude. 

I enjoyed the style of the menu. You can choose a bag or a basket and an array of sides. I chose the simple fried fish and chips because there were not very many cheap options that weren't fried. It was a TON of food. If you are going on an empty stomach and starving, it would likely be perfect. I would have been happy to split this with a friend. 

Great for family dinners and out-of-towners craving seafood! I wish they had a healthy options section on the menu, but if price is not a problem, you can certainly make it a very healthy meal!"}
{"text":"My daughter had the Mac and cheese. She has no allergies and threw up after. She said it was the worst Mac and cheese she's had in her entire life. My husband and I both agreed that it was not good."}
{"text":"Dear Angry Crab,
Specifically, Ms. Autumn (the owner) and Tyson (our server),
You guys went above and beyond for us. And I want to take the time to thank you.

I called them on Thursday to see if I could possibly make a reservation for Friday due to my boyfriend's mother being elderly (83) and a cancer survivor who cannot stand for long periods of time. They do not take reservations. But the owner came to our rescue and accommodated our request. We \"reserved\" a table for Friday at 6. We were sat by 6:10 p.m. The place was packed. They completely jumped through hoops for us. 

Our server was a darling gentleman named Tyson. ABSOLUTELY fantastic! (Although Autumn did promise we won't have to be tortured by him next time :) ) 
This place was PACKED! People running around, trying to take care of everyone, trying to serve everyone... craziness. The thing I noticed was EVERYONE was smiling, laughing, enjoying every minute (try finding that on a busy Friday night!)  We chatted with the people sitting next to us (both when we briefly waited for our table and when we were seated at our table) and the atmosphere was just one of pure enjoyment and laughter. 

The food was above and beyond. We ordered oysters, we ordered king crab... we ordered dungeoness crab... it was just absolutely delicious! Ooooh.......... get the damn hush puppies!!! YUM! We ordered it at \"level 4\" which was perfect for us. We LOVE HOT! But the level 5 was just hot... 4 was much more flavorful. 

I NEVER give 5 stars... but I promise you, this place is worth every one of them. PLUS, locally owned and operated, which is hard to find in Chandler, Arizona. 

We will be back. Again and again! Consider yourself warned Angry Crab.......... you have created monsters! Soooooooooooooo good!!!! And such awesome service!!"}
{"text":"I had heard about this place so finally had the opportunity to give it a go.  Oh my goodness!  Crab, shrimp, clams in a lovely boil season was so incredible.  Our 10 year old tried the alligator and that was tasty!  Our server was great - on point the entire evening.  Definitely going back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time a few weeks ago for lunch it was very good! I would suggest giving guest gloves because it is pretty messy!"}
{"text":"Don't know why I didn't go sooner. Great seafood selection and cooked New England style. Very crowded on a Wednesday night but got lucky and we grabbed a seat at the bar. It can get a little messy but that's the norm for this style food .  Service was outstanding and how their system worked was thoroughly explained by the bartender who was a real hustler.

Will definitely go back and will probably become a regular."}
{"text":"I gave this locations a chance three times and I didn't like it. I still travel and go to the location off 28th st  and Indian School.  At the Goodyear location the trifecta sauce didn't have any flavor tasted a little water down.  The second time it didn't have no garlic like the add butter to make the sauce last for the night. At the Phoenix location the sauce is thick and a lot of garlic with a lot of flavor."}
{"text":"Wow!  Seafood by the pound mixed with whole red potatoes and Cajun sausage.  Spicy, messy goodness.  This place is great.  Wear dark colors and be prepared to get messy.  Everything is served whole.  We had the shrimp, clams, and crawfish with trifecta sauce on level 2 heat.  Damn good!  Now I need to go wash my hands and face."}
{"text":"Love this place for crab or oysters. The steam pot that I prefer is Trifecta-3 with either snow crab or king crab. Beware Trifecta-3 is more than warm, as my wife says its way too HOT. Not sure how anyone can order the 5. The raw oysters are always terrific, I do have to ask for hotsauce and horsey sauce each time. They only bring out cocktail sauce with lime/lemons. You'll need to plan on waiting if you are going over the weekend. Wait times for a table can be 30-60 minutes.

A while back I thought I would venture out and try something different than the normal order above. I ordered the blue crab and was disgusted, I will never order that again! The kids menu is simple but of course my kids want crab and they dont have a small portion on the kids menu so we end up splitting a steam pot for the 2 of them. Staff is friendly and all around a great place for what they offer. I have never ordered the BBQ so I cant recommend that!

BRING A MARKER CAUSE YOU MIGHT WANT TO RIGHT ON THE WALL OR LEAVE YOUR SIGNATURE BEHIND! LOL"}
{"text":"Great, fresh seafood.  Only negative thing I can say about this place is the appearance of their building.  It doesn't look great from the outside but the seafood is great!"}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to come to Angry Crab tonight because we love the atmosphere and the food! We usually go to the one in Peoria but I creeped and found that they opened one up just 10 mins away from where we live. Um YAS! We rolled up around 6:40 and expected a wait. Yep 40 mins. That's fine, they'll text you when your table's ready! We sit and our waitress, Jinifer, took our order. She was great! The food arrived and we started goin ham. The food was amazing as always, no complaints! The only reason why I docked a star was because of the hostess aka. Ms. Booty Shorts from now on, who was roaming around and staring at people...she sat a table behind us and a minute later Ms. Booty Shorts came back and told them \"Um sorry but you are sitting at the wrong table. I'm going to have to ask you to move\"...Wat? She gave them a pointed look and a sharp hand flick to a table across the way. Come on girl. 

But anyways, I'd still go back because the atmosphere is great and the food is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Seafood is awesome!
BBQ is for morons - 
Crab was on the sign. 

A haiku about what to eat. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Best place in AZ for seafood by far!!!! Only giving 4 stars and not 5 because they lack a little bit of consistency with the temperature of their sides for example a few times my corn that I order with my crab has been a little cold or they let the fries or wings sit in the window too long when they are busy. The seafood has always been hot and fresh though.. My favorite is definitely the Dungeness crab it's always fresh and super hot when it gets to your table. My hubby loves the crawfish and mussels .. I recommend the trifecta sauce then just choose what heat level you can handle. Service is always great if you get Michele, and don't be afraid to ask for her. She is super friendly and even will offer to help crack open your crab for you if you would like. The few times we have been there and didn't get Michele we were very disappointed. Overall I may have a slight addiction to this place as it is as close as you can get to a boiling crab in Arizona"}
{"text":"This place had been recommended so many times, we had to try it!  Wow! What an experience, it has been years since it was ok to eat with your hands!  Messy, but oh so worth it.  We tried a pound of each - king crab and shrimp trifecta style which was scrumptious but had a kick!  I ordered bread to assist which worked well.  I can't wait to go back for more!  I would think kids would truly enjoy it too!"}
{"text":"Very unique seafood joint, but so very good. From Char'd Oysters, Gumbo and Hush Puppies for appetizer to the boils. Shrimp were large, lots of mussels, and crab legs. Bring your wipes and get ready to get down and dirty eating. Bibs for everyone! A must when in the area!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is very good and service is pretty solid, too. It is very spicy, even the 1 out of 5 is, so be aware of that. Good cheap beer too."}
{"text":"Really was not impressed with this place. My boyfriend and I ordered the charred oysters. Which tasted really fishy. We also ordered a pound of shrimp and mussels, both were very bland and had little flavor. The customer service was ok but I wont be coming back for seconds."}
{"text":"My husband and I love eating here! The food is fresh and always hot as soon as we get it. If they are busy (which is usually the case) we have about a 20-30 minute wait. There's good parking as well."}
{"text":"Spoke to Gm Joe about gift card issue. Went in a talked to Alison, the manager at that location and they rectified  the problem by issuing me a $25.00 gift card and $10.00 gift card. Thank you guys  for stepping up and giving A+ customer service!"}
{"text":"Being this was our first visit the server was very thorough and detailed about their menu.  Ordered king crab, snow crab, and shrimp. The traditional boil was well spiced at the level we desired.  The trifecta was EXCELLENT!  Super buttery, full flavored garlic without the large chunks or being overbearing.  It was nice to eat this Cajun seafood and not smell of it all day long, unlike many other restaurants similar.  The quality of the king crab was great... The shells crack and break, not bend.  The meat on the ends are white. The pound seems to be true to weight.  They provide a bucket for your shells.  The paper for the table is waxy so it doesn't not easily tear through when wet.  Great overall."}
{"text":"5 stars for food. 
2 stars for service. 

Angry Crab is reminiscent of Boiling Crab, which I've had in California. So, when I made plans to visit my brother here in Arizona, I made sure to include Angry Crab in our itinerary. 

So, we show up for dinner as a party of 3 and are immediately seated. Our waitress comes by and asks us if we have ever been to Angry Crab and I respond by saying, \"No but we have been to a restaurant that is extremely similar.\" Then she responds in a snarky tone, \"Have you been to an Angry Crab?\" So after saying no, she gives us a whole run down on how to order, what sauces are, etc. Mind you, we already know how because the menu is almost identical to Boiling Crab. ANYWHO - for the rest of the night, our waitress would only address my brother when she was speaking to us, not looking at either myself nor our girl friend who came along. 

We went with a pound of shrimp and a pound of snow crab legs - trifecta sauce (Cajun, lemon pepper and garlic). At Boiling Crab, they call this same sauce combo \"The Whole Shabang.\" We ask ordered a side of rice, some butter and a side of French fries. 

Our seafood and rice came quickly. The butter was nowhere to be found. The Cajun fries never came. And we were so fed up with our waitress that we didn't even bother speaking up about it.

Anywho, the seafood was amazing! The sauce was great. Dip the seafood into the lemon & pepper they bring to your table - enhances the flavor ten-fold. I think we got the bottom of the batch of rice because it was a little firm but whatever.

The food completely surpassed the service. Maybe the other Angry Crab Shack locations have less annoying waitresses. Fun experience because of the people I came with, not because of the people we interacted with upon arrival."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by stating that I did NOT eat any seafood here, so my review is purely based on their BBQ.
I understand this is a popular place for seafood and my friends say it's one of the best in the valley. So I can imagine a seafood review getting at least 4 stars, if not 5.
But.... I am here to talk about the BBQ portion of their menu.... which is a 3 star experience at best.

The restaurant itself is very casual and spacious, and has a fun but not overbearing atmosphere. Great place for families and big groups as well as something more casually intimate for 2. I like that there is butcher paper instead of tablecloths... their meals are VERY messy! you also get bibs and gloves if you order the seafood.  The staff is very friendly. 

I have been here twice now, and while I can tell my fellow diners really enjoyed their plastic bags full of seafood that you eat by hand, I can't say I was very impressed with their Louisiana style BBQ. 
The beef brisket is only slightly tender, but not particularly so. Compared to Bootlegger's in Old Town Scottsdale where the brisket just melts in your mouth, this is just a hair above average. The brisket definitely had a \"smoked\" flavour, but it was not coalescing very well with any flavour from the meat - which seemed a little more dry than it should. It was a smokey flavour that leaned more towards a burnt taste, than a savory beef taste.  
There are two sauce options - one is a sugary tangy sweet bbq sauce and the other a New Orleans style mustard. Both were pretty good, though nothing sensational. 
On my first visit I got the 2 meat platter - brisket and ribs. While the brisket failed to impress me, the ribs were so forgettable that I can't really think of anything to write about them. They were just very average, not memorable at all. 
On my 2nd visit, I decided to try the brisket sandwich. an utter failure! While the meat itself was the same as the platter from my initial visit (at least they are consistent), as a sandwich it was a disaster... because of the bread. Un-toasted Texas toast... with the consistency of a wonder bread. I picked up the sandwich with both hands, and before even 1 bite, it had completely fallen apart. Honestly, I don't get how in the world they get away with calling this a sandwich -  its a nasty mess because of the utterly generic low quality bread. I had to peel off the soggy broken up bread and just ate the brisket with a fork after that. NOT worth $11. no way. 
The menu said the sandwich was topped with cole slaw. I asked the waitress to add red onion and she asked \"on the sandwich, with the cole slaw?\" \"yes!\"... well they brought it out and both the slaw and the onion were on the side. So either the waitress was not listening to me, or the cook was not paying attention. Either way, that is how it was brought out to me and it was pretty annoying to have to try and assemble the sandwich myself now - made that much more difficult by the fact that assembly is impossible when you can't even pick it up without it disintegrating in your hands. I had also asked for both sauces on the side, and only 1 came. While they were very nice, the service left a little to be desired. Not to mention we had a table of multiple people and only my food came out first and everyone else sat there for 10 minutes while I awkwardly stared at my food because I didn't want to start eating before anyone was even served! That's just rude and inconsiderate.

Along with the sandwich, which I would NEVER order again, I got a side of cajun fries which were excellent, and a side of mac n cheese that came out ice cold and wasn't that good. 

If you are looking for really good BBQ in the valley, I would recommend Bootlegger's in Old Town Scottsdale, and not the Angry Crab and their Louisiana style smokehouse, which is average at best.
For seafood? This place is probably quite recommendable, but again, this review is solely to critique the 2nd half of their menu, the BBQ, a \"meh\" experience."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan!

Enough that I created a UYE as an excuse to go back.
IMHO, boils are a very social event. While it's perfectly acceptable to just go as a single, or a couple, or in the case of my last visit, three girlfriends having lunch, it's really a case of \"the more, the merrier!\"
It's messy, table manners are non existent, and the social/party atmosphere of the boil makes the food taste even better!

This is also NOT a New Orleans style boil. Most of the seasoning is added after the animal is removed from the water. (Which is how they can offer so many flavors.) The taste is still great, but it's MUCH messier. Apparently, this is how it's done in most places outside New Orleans. Not bad, just different. And good to know before walking in.

There are non-boil things on the menu - I may venture into the fried appetizers at some point. But this place is all about the boil! Shrimp, blue crab, crab legs, lobster, crawfish, etc. All sold by the pound and you pick your seasonings.

We shared a half dozen of the grilled oysters. Not as good as ACME or Drago's in NOLA, but better than I ever expected to find in AZ.

The three of us were all in agreement to go with their spice level 3 (\"I can't feel my mips.\") It was not that hot. Good flavor - but it wasn't as hot as I was hoping or expecting. And we shared 1 pound of shrimp and 4 pounds of crawfish (running a special - if you buy 3, you get 1 free.) We added some corn and potatoes and loved our little mini-boil.

I was quite happy they have Abita on tap - and if they add Amber in addition to Purple Haze, I may just add that 5th star! :)

And my happy bit of not-so-insider information - they will be opening a second location (with BBQ!) this fall in Central Phoenix. So I won't have to trek to the outer reaches of the Valley to get my crawfish fix! In fact, the new place will be just over a mile from my house! Woot!

It's not cheap - but this is AZ. And the salt-water animals don't just swim up to the front door. Totally good value for the dollar - and I am glad to have them in town!"}
{"text":"Its a unique experiences. Despite the location and ambiance this is not inexpensive . then
 Food is excellent but bring your wallet"}
{"text":"The \"& BBQ\" had me a bit curious. I've been to other angry crabs bit this was my first BBQ one. 

Love the whole seafood boil idea, eating with your hands and enjoying the flavorful sauce that douses the  seafood of your choice. Add some sausage or corn for some extra fun!

My family and I enjoyed a night here and it was pretty perfect since my brother isn't a big seafood lover. The cheeseburger on the menu was a shock to me but much appreciated by my brother. 

Enjoyed the shrimp with the trifecta sauce, next time I'd like it a little more spicy but overall tasty!

Service was pretty good, above par. Hostess wasn't amongst the friendliest but our sever was great!"}
{"text":"Such a disappointing event. Drove 40 min. They promoted this boil for months with Angry Crab...and guess what...one line for the entire festival. This was the worst event I have been to and I hope they don't waste people's time next year."}
{"text":"What a let down. Slow service. No carbs available, and more than half my order of substituted clams arrived unopened. Makes me wonder about freshness. Appetizer was almost a no show, had to ask for it as well as water. And had to request bill be adjusted for the 15 clams that were unedible. Boy was I hoping for more."}
{"text":"Bartender is nice and attentive. Place is clean. I ordered the 2 meat platter with a pound of steamed shrimp, cole slaw and beans. The cole slaw has absolutely no taste. The beans are decent, little on the sweet side. Sauce they give is tangy. Brisket is delicious. Some of the best brisket I ever had. The ribs were well prepared also. The shrimp was excellent. I had a great eating experience. Because of the crappy cole slaw I have to ding them."}
{"text":"So glad Angry Crab came to Ahwatukee. Food was full of flavor, drinks were a good mix. Beer glasses could have been cold(er) but for the volume of business I am going to let it go. We ordered food and you would think it would all come at the same time (right?) No expediter in the kitchen maybe??  The fries arrive, then the imitation butter for dipping seafood arrives then 5 minutes later the shrimp arrive and then another 2-3 minutes the crab arrived tada!...

We had 1 lb of HEADon Shrimp.  I am not use to eating shrimp and having the devein and remove heads. I will not order them again. Big turn off! Raise the price and take the heads away please.  They were also overcooked. The Dungeness Crab  - was to be 2 LB  (actually was 1 lb 9oz) sounds like a lot but once you remove all the big shell and the claw shells it was barely enough for 2 people. BUT it was cooked perfectly and we enjoyed it the most. We wanted the Maryland crabs but the server said they were small. Being from Maryland we don't eat small Maryland crabs, they are not meaty so that is why we got the Dungeness Crab but it too was on the smaller size. 

All was flavored nicely, the fries extra yummy and the service was exceptional.

Sunday night was birthday night, I think 4-5 just from the time we sat and ate. The fog horn sounds every time so everyone can clap for the birthday folks. (Do you have to show ID for those B-days?...my birthday may be in a few weeks :) 
 
Nice to see Nascar was on 1 TV so I could see the end of the race. 
The LIGHTING....  Dim the lights a little please. (cheaters beware brights lights) I know you are a restaurant, I didn't think I needed my sunglasses indoors 8pm. 

I didn't like the napkin holders on the tables - I would rather have a roll of paper towels.
I didn't like the giant plastic red ketcup bottle on the tables (just tacky and cheap)
Headon shrimp - We don't buy them that way in the grocery store why sell them this way.

All in all I will stop back in a few to give it another try."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to angry crab shack and BBQ today on Hawes and Guadalupe for the first time. We have been going to the original angry crab shack on Alma School for many years. The quality of the crab was not the same at this location. It was very dry. I have bought frozen crab before from the grocery store and this is what it reminded me of. The bread was so hard we could have used it as a rock. Our server, Irene, was wonderful. She was so upbeat and a great server all around. But we probably won't be coming back to this location because of the quality of food. I think the customer turnover rate is much higher at the Alma School location and  I think that's why we have never had a bad experience at there. The food seems so much fresher. We went to the Hawes Angry Crab on a Friday at 3 pm. The Alma School restaurant is usually pretty packed at that time so we decided to try out the Hawes location. Oh well, I guess when you know you have a good thing you shouldn't change it up. I'm giving this review 3 stars because the BBQ pork was great and so was our server Irene. Crab was terrible."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the seafood boil concept this is the place for you.   If you are looking for good service and good food i'd suggest going elsewhere.  The crab legs were just ok, nothing to get excited about.   I had their \"most popular seasoning\" but found it bland...I would have just preferred garlic butter I think.   Our waitress was annoying and slow. Overall not a great experience."}
{"text":"I love sea food and I loved the Angry Crab Shack.  Wife and I came in for a date night using a gift certificate and tried a bag with 2 pounds of crab, a grilled meat platter for 2 and an appetizer of gator bites.  I'm glad that the waitress explained that when you add spice to the bag hot means hot.  We ordered mild and that had me sweating a bit.  Everything was so good.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Well it's new and was very busy. Getting to the bar and getting someone's attention was a challenge. Ordered two margaritas. Did I say virgin margaritas? WTH. Ok drinking my juice waiting for the table. Waitress greets us and is nice. Explains the menu and leaves. We ordered an appetizer based on her suggestion. Waiting for appetizer to arrive. My wifes order arrives first. Bag of shrimp dumped in front of her in a bag. I ask about the appetizer. They state it just comes out when it comes out. Ok so where's my dinner. Oh yours takes longer so it will be out in nine minutes. I'm like so why didn't you hold her plate? Oh we don't do that and he walks away. My meal arrives. Still no appetizer? 5 minutes later appetizer arrived. Supposed to be grilled oysters. They seemed boiled. Cayenne pepper on top. With some untoasted plain stale bread laying on top. Blah. No plates or utensils. Horrible experience. Joes crab shack is solo much better"}
{"text":"Oooohhhh seafood!! New location in Goodyear. I am so glad the new location is open. Came here three times already since its been open and hoping to come again. I love getting their shrimp and crawfish with trifecta and medium spice. It gives it such a great flavor. I usually add sausages, potatoes and corn. Omg sausages are great! And with the sauce it makes it even better!! I can live without the potatoes. Lol but definitely add some goodies to it. Hope next time I come it won't be a long wait like this last time. Due to nascar it was extremely busy. The staff is so attentive and friendly, maybe too friendly haha. if you've never been to an angry crab they will definitely make suggestions for you. So come soon"}
{"text":"So we had been to Alma school location many times and LOVED it...then this popped up way closer to us. First visit a few months ago was disappointing in comparison but we figured it was growing pains and gave them another shot...Glad we did because they are closer and just as good!"}
{"text":"Went to Angry Crab and BBQ for the first time Saturday. Loud environment. Slow service. You chose you're own seasoning and sauce (heat level). I went with the Trifecta on a pound of crab legs it was good. Went with just Kajun on the crawfish but it was tasteless. No plates.. just a table covering. Didn't wait long for the food to come out. Fries are delicious, I like my hush puppies a lil sweet but theirs are spicy. Different but good."}
{"text":"One of my go to spots. Great seafood, great beer. The bloody Mary's are cool as hell too! Trifecta is my favorite sauce, and I always get rice with the seafood because getting the sauce all over the rice is bomb! Go here, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"My family and I have been to this location several times for dinner and to celebrate birthdays. It is a great place for groups and if it's just a small table for two.

First of all, Angry Crab Shack is similar to a seafood broil. The menu lists the seafood options with costs, and there are market prices and special seafood options daily. After you pick your seafood, you then pick your flavoring and spice level. If you're looking for a basic, tasty flavor for your first time, I would recommend the Trifecta. Once you place your order, you will get bibs and a bucket or two. Since you'll be eating with your hands on the table, if you're not into getting your hands messy, you can ask for gloves. They recently changed their bibs, which used to have a small sleeve to catch food you drop, and now they are green and a little cheaper in quality. Depending on the seafood you order, you'll also be given scissors and tools to crack open crab. If you order crab, they'll ask you if you'd like it over or under 2 lbs. For our family of 5, we always go for over 2 lbs. While you eat, place your shells and scraps into the bucket and the servers will empty them as needed.

If communal seafood bags is not your style, you can always opt for different sandwiches and individual food options. There is also a small kid's menu, so if you have little ones with you, there's something for them, too, if they don't like seafood. 

If you're celebrating a birthday, the birthday person gets a choice of either a slice of cheesecake or root beer float. Be prepared to have them ring a bell and announce your name!

Overall, Angry Crab Shack is a great option for a special dinner. It's a little pricey compared to other dinner options, but the quality is good, especially for seafood in the desert. Get ready to get a little messy, eating with your hands!"}
{"text":"Had a lot of fun eating their food, it was hot and Delicious. I would go one down with the spice levels because it's a little hotter than most restaurants. But definitely going again."}
{"text":"Wow. This place was great, from the beginning when I went to put my name in for a table I was greeted with a big smile and great character. Cassie was our server and Greg was her trainee, both were outstanding with everything! The food was delicious, some of the best I've had. I ordered a basket of fries after I had already received my shrimp and it took longer than expected to get my fries but Cassie came over and sincerely apologized and said the fries were on the house! Right after this Derek (the GM) came to our table to make sure everything was okay and he also apologized and gave me his card and told me to let him know the next time I was going to eat there. I was amazed at how well I was treated and how great the food was. I'll definitely be coming here more often."}
{"text":"Out of the two locations I've been to in the valley this is by far the best. The food was excellent. Shrimp and crab legs in the trifecta sauce with sizzling spice sauce A+. They ago above and beyond there with the service especially Jeff I believe was his name. Very helpful man. Plus they have my favorite beer on tap Abita Purple Haze We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best seafood place in AZ. Trifecta 1! Sauce is great mix of their sauces. A definite must try for any seafood lover. 

Preprare to get your hands dirty but it will be worth it."}
{"text":"Angry Crab Shack is place with no shortage of quirks.  Aside from offering a fairly unique menu of southern seafood and barbecue, the restaurant itself is something of a carnival ride gone off the rails.  Built to mimic the feel of a gloriously unsophisticated shack, Angry Crab knows how to stand out in a neighborhood that conforms to a different look and feel.  Their hot sauces range from a mild jalapeño to the Carolina Reaper (the second hottest pepper on the planet, no joke).  And they even have a siren up at the bar that blasts with a deafening volume for birthdays and for those brave enough to tackle the Reaper.  And you're not only allowed but encouraged to draw on the walls.  Yeah, Angry Crab is different.  And I'll happily embrace different if the food knocks my socks off.  Arriving here on a Monday around dinner time, I ventured into the shack for the first time.

Located on the northeast corner of 28th Street & Indian School, Angry Crab's Phoenix location is easily visible from the street thanks to the giant balloon crab statue guarding the front entrance.  The restaurant can seat well over 100 at fully capacity and at times feels like a sports bar thanks to the copious number of televisions on the walls.  The bar was full when I arrived so I grabbed one of the booths on the side.  The menu here gives you a lot of options for meal customization.  The main part of the menu involves the seafood market, in which you choose your seafood, choose your sauces, choose your spice level, and they bring the mixture out to your table in a clear plastic bag.  Though I love crab, lobster, clams, and all the other seafood offered via the market, I wasn't feeling up to the laborious task of breaking and digging for the good stuff.  Thankfully, there's other options including their meat market full of barbecue items, their seafood baskets, as well as their Po'Boy sandwiches.

For starters, I decided to take a chance on their signature in house drink.  The Oyster Shooter.  Local AZ vodka (didn't catch which brand), lime, cajun seasoning, and a raw oyster at the bottom.  For my meal, I was feeling like a Po'Boy.  As this is Angry \"Crab\" I went with the soft shell crab Po'Boy.  Also grabbed some hush puppies and sweet potato fries.  For dessert, I asked the waitress to give me a recommendation between their bourbon pecan and red velvet cheesecake slices.  She chose the cheesecake so that was that.  Total cost for all the food plus tax and tip came to $40.

First the Oyster Shooter.  Honestly, it wasn't my thing.  This was more of a double shot moreso than a full drink.  The vodka and oyster were both fine, but honestly I think the cajun seasoning was a little bit of overkill here.  I'm okay with spicing up a drink a little bit but there was so much that it kind of killed the enjoyment of the alcohol for me.  Let's move onto the Po'Boy.  I got my soft shell crab sandwich dressed with creole mustard, lettuce, tomato, pickle and mayo.  I was pretty happy with this sandwich as the fried crab was well cooked and the mixture of veggies and mustard gave it just enough brine and spice.  The hush puppies on the other hand, were a bit of a disappointment.  These had a little bit too much of a liquid texture instead of the soft but bread-like texture I prefer.  The sweet potato fries were good, nothing special, but fine.  As soon as my dinner was done, out came the cheesecake slice (on a foam plate?).  Unfortunately this too fell a little bit flat.  The cake honestly tasted like it had been made days earlier and had a tough texture.  Most unfortunate was that the red velvet flavoring was barely perceptible.

All things considered, a pretty disappointing outing my first go around here.  The Po'Boy and fast friendly service from my waitress was just enough to get their Yelp score to a 3 for me, but only barely.  Next time perhaps I'll stick to their trademark seafood and meat market menus and take my chances there.  I very much want owner Ron Lou's locally owned operation to succeed, but first impressions were very much in the \"meh\" category for me.  Quirky can be a good thing, but make sure the food is equal to the task."}
{"text":"My husband says he has always had a good experience at the Angry Crab's other locations.  The Sunday eve we went , the service was hap hazard and the manager had  little wisdom when he came to our table to offer the excuse 'we have printer problems in the kitchen - it's not your server'! We hadn't complained, so a start for noticing. But, excuses are never acceptable and in this case not believable. We asked for water for a person at our table three times! We asked three times for gumbo that finally arrived with three of the entrees. I was half way through my meal before my sauce and the tiny pieces of cornbread, in paper trays, arrived (having asked yes, three times!) If a printer is at fault for not bringing water and flatware after three requests, you may want to review your business processes. The people at our table who ordered the seafood boil and salmon said it was good, as was the extremely late to the party gumbo. The calamari was overcooked and not rubbery, but nearly. The salad was generous, but the dressing skimpy for such a large bowl. Oh, and they lost our reservation that was made in person!  The bartender was kind and helpful, but it hardly made up for the imposed auto-added 18% tip. The manager should put his money where his excuses are and discount a bad experience, or offer 'please come back gift card'... The only way I would try again is if it were free and only b/c my husband has enjoyed his past trips."}
{"text":"Great food but pricy. Service was great. So much to choose from.. Plan on making  it a special place to eat out."}
{"text":"We got off to a rough start. Frankly, after reading several reviews about slow or bad service, I was pretty critical about the service. After sitting at the table for several minutes a sever, who said he was not our server, came for our drink order - and we put in the kids order at the same time. We got our drinks and continued to sit and wait for a good 15 minutes, apparently in some sort of serverless black hole. No one would make eye contact and pretty much just rushed around attending to other things. Finally, the gentleman who took our drink order noticed that we were still sitting with menus in front of us, and my father-in-laws beer was empty. He was seen talking to a server and that server came over to start helping us. I don't remember her name but once she realized we were her table she was very attentive from that point. 

They were running a special, 1/2 Dungeness crab, 1/2 lb king crab and one blue crab with veggies for $20. That sounded good, so my FIL and I both ordered that, along with one pound of headless shrimp for my husband. Sadly, by the time the server put the order in there was only one special left. My FIL let me have it and ordered a fish basket. All the food was very good! We had edemame, hush puppies, kids chicken and fries, oysters on the half, the crab special (trifecta, level 3), shrimp (trifecta, level 3) and the fish basket. I was great with the trifecta at level 3, my husband will go with level 4 next visit. 

The food just kept coming, and we all left stuffed. It was my birthday so the server even finished us up with a big piece of chocolate cake. We will go earlier next time, they were out of crawfish and the special by the time we went around 7."}
{"text":"Delicious food. The mussels are delicious the sweet n tangy sauce is good. But the crawfish was overpriced for what you got"}
{"text":"Yes and Yes! I rolled out of there.  The food was amazing! Kind of a mad house so the service is just ok, but they are very nice."}
{"text":"I had a chance to give this place another try, and needless to say I was not disappointed. I also realized that this place has numerous parking spaces, so it was better for me not to fight too hard for it.

Service here is getting better and better each day, I love how the servers make me feel so comfortable and they are so attentive. Taking a look at a next table, I see him cracking crab legs for a lady (aw how nice)

About the food, raw oysters are so fresh, and they have fixed prices between fresh seafood and frozen seafood so customers won't feel trapped. I usually choose the Trifecta for my seafood seasoning, and never gone wrong with that choice.

The portion of sweet potatoes is huge, and I left this place with a full tummy. When my tummy is happy, then I'm happy. Just as simple as that."}
{"text":"The staff are friendly, efficient and courteous, the place is funky and different in a fun sort of way.  I have never ordered the fresh seafood in a bag, but everything else on the menu tastes and appears as if it comes out of the freezer, not bad, but not great and certainly not fresh."}
{"text":"Went to the Mesa location last weekend with a coworker. I got shrimp and crawfish, trifecta and spice levels 4 and 5. I loved it so much that I wanted it again and gave this location a shot, but instead of levels 4 and 5, I went 5 and 6.

Never. Ever.  Ever again. 6 HURTS your tongue, your nose, your stomach lining.  I nearly puked as I desperately searched for some Tums. Props to the Angry Crab for creating a spice that is true to its name, the Grim Reaper. You have been warned.

FYI despite the pain and suffering, I did manage to finish over 2 lbs. of crawfish. Buttttt I am NEVER doing this ever again. I'll stick with levels 3-5 from here on out...

Update: 9 antacid tablets later and I still hate myself and am full of regret. The seething pain lasted all throughout the night and I had to call in sick this morning. It still hurts. NEVER. AGAIN."}
{"text":"I don't think there are enough words to convey how much I loved my first experience at Angry Crab Shack.  I had been wanting to try it forever, and my sister and her husband surprised me by taking me here for my birthday.  First of all, know that this restaurant is not for the faint of heart--it is loud and as far away from white linen dining as you can get.  But you have to love a place where you're encouraged to eat with your hands, right?  We ordered a pound of shrimp, an order of the catfish, and a soft-shelled crab w/fries.  Just to let you know how delicious everything was, this dinner happened almost two months ago and I'm still fantasizing about it.  It was so good, easily the best meal I've had in a long time.  I had such a great time.  Just don't forget to order a couple pieces of sausage for the seafood, it is so tasty.  The one and only negative thing I have to say about the whole experience is that their desserts are not that great.  Granted, I understand people don't eat here for the cheesecake, but it was a bit disappointing.  Despite that, the next time I come (and you can bet there will be a next time), I might be tempted to smuggle in a loaf of crusty bread to sop up that delicious broth at the bottom of the bag.  Yum yum!"}
{"text":"If you want to come over and see abunch of crabs and Worms. This is the best place to eat"}
{"text":"Soooo bland literally no flavor. I had to shake on so much salt to make my salmon edible. And way too expensive would have rather gone to red lobster."}
{"text":"Went to dinner there tonight for the grand opening with my husband, I have been anxiously waiting for this location to open as we live right across the street. Soo excited to have an Angry Crab Shack in Ahwatukee since we are frequent visitors of the other 2 locations. The food was delicious , they have the seafood, the bbq and the addition of the pizzas which were light and fluffy . I got the delicious crab and shrimp and husband got the pepperoni. Also tried the clams, shrimp and the snow crab legs with the trifecta which all tasted magnificent! Judy was our waitress and was on point , very attentive and we received overall great service! Super thrilled and excited to return!"}
{"text":"Today is my birthday and they decided to close for a staff party at 8 and didn't post anything on the website. We drove 20 minutes away to come to the Location. I love crabs and this is all I wanted to eat today. Thank you for making me never want to come back."}
{"text":"BARF! Throw the whole place away. I'm not sure what the hype is about. Worst seafood I've EVER had in life and can go the rest of my life without it. So disappointed. The server was very nice and that's about it."}
{"text":"This place is fun!! Peel and eat shrimp in a bag full of flavor and goodness!  Love it!"}
{"text":"Overall review will be 3.7 stars. The boiled bag of shrimp was excellent. Although I wish I got the level 2 spicy. 1 was too weak. The coleslaw and potato salad were not impressive. Fried catfish and soft shell crab were very tasty. Gumbo was too salty. Overall, the main dishes were great but not the side items. Our server was extremely nice. I will definitely go back when I return to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Didn't take pics this time, and forgot to write down the servers name, but she was awesome!

If you like crab boils, you'll be happy here.  
If you don't like crab boils, then there's BBQ.

One more tip - don't wear a white shirt - but if you do, use the bib.  :-)"}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday night with my hubby and another couple. There was no wait at 6pm. 
We ordered a pound of shrimp with the Trifecta spice, a pound of snow crab with lemon and garlic butter, a few potatoes, hush puppies, calamari strips, and a Buffalo Chicken Slider and a Cheeseburger (what can you do when they don't like seafood?) 
The seafood was amazing as was the spices on all of it. It was all perfectly seasoned. The potatoes were perfectly cooked. The calamari was the best I have had in quite awhile. 
The service was really great, as were the prices. I truly had no complaints and hope I can go back soon!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with friends. And had to come back again for dinner. Great service and Awesome atmosphere for hanging out and catching up. The crawfish in the trifecta sauce was fantastic."}
{"text":"The Pacific Rim Curry seasoning was absolutely amazing.  I had them spice mine a 2.  So good you don't even need butter.  The Cajun Fries are crisp and full of flavor.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Warning: If you're from Maryland, you will get homesick for blue crabs.  Angry Crab is expensive, that's without saying, but it's WORTH IT.  Seafood is flown in daily and you order it by the pound.  Get ready to get dirty because there are no utensils ... you're digging in manually!  I can't say one negative thing about Angry Crab .... reminded me of all the crab feasts back in Baltimore :)"}
{"text":"Drove 25 miles to eat at Angry Crab tonight.  Date night for me and Hubby.  The food isn't like it used to be.  I like spicy food and Angry Crab had spice a year ago.  If you've eaten here before and loved it, don't go back.  The food isn't the same.  My sauce was horrible, instead of spicy.  It tasted like it was reused sauce with no season....."}
{"text":"Initially, this visit started poorly, as the waiter seemed uninterested. Not wanting this visit to continue this way, we started asking questions as though we knew nothing and needed help. Well, it worked.....the service improved as he helped my father smash open his lobster with a rock. It then continued with a free cheesecake for my birthday and he made a big deal announcing it to all. He began to engage himself with us. Good recovery Joe!!! The food rates VERY high, so overall I give this visit 4 of 5 stars. 

I originally wrote a scalding review and I immediately received an email from the owner of Angry Crab, demonstrating his concern. This truly impressed me and I will now revisit the Mesa location. Never looking for freebies from these reviews.........I simply enjoy excellent service which I will generously tip for."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! It was our first time on Sunday and we were impressed! The food and service were fantastic! Our bartender Cat was outstanding! So glad we tried Angry Crab! Food was cooked perfect and portion size was huge! Thank you for a great experience, we will definitely be back with the kids!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat, hands down. Our server, JEFF, was funny, charismatic, bubbly, and obviously truly enjoys his job.  He knocked it out of the park. My husband and I both ordered 1lb snow crab with trifecta seasonings and it was TO DIE FOR. The gumbo was a massive portion and tasted just like mom's! Amazing food, perfect vibe, exceptional portions, and extremely reasonable prices.....5 5 5 5 5 5 5 stars for days!"}
{"text":"They never do to go order right there is always something wrong or something is missing such as a dressing etc 
Another they have great wings sometime however their heat is very different from on experience to another I can't believe it"}
{"text":"Great place for steamed crab legs and shrimp in a bag filled with delicious spices and seasonings.  We like it spicy  and they don't disappoint.  Prices are reasonable.  Even their wings are good.  Wouldn't recommend the bbq but that's just me.  Hubby ordered the brisket and said it was dry."}
{"text":"Seafood, fried calamari, cajun fries, cocktail sauce all excellent! Great prices on everything. Fun atmosphere with TVs everywhere. Service is great! I will be back."}
{"text":"Most everything about this place is pretty good. However the service is not at all. Actually the servers can be quite attentive but they are not always. The problem seems to be the way the restaurant service is organized.  Of the eight times we've been there and ordered a dozen raw oysters as an appetizer we've only actually received the oysters four times.  And only once were they brought before the rest of the meal. Once you start eating spicy food you can't taste the oysters so it's worthless if they are not brought ahead of time.  Of the four times they did bring oysters and they did not come out as appetizers I sent them back twice.  Keep in mind that after the first couple of times I was always specific with the server about wanting the oysters ahead of the meal.  It didn't help.  

We usually all order shrimp. The orders don't come out together and can be five minutes or so between deliveries. You must open the sealed bags immediately to let the heat out or the shrimp continues to cook and turns to rubber. So some in the party are eating while others are waiting. Another reason to want oysters first. Still, we go about once a month. Food is good and prices reasonable. The issues just keep the number of stars down."}
{"text":"First time here and my first time trying crab.  Our waitress was extremely nice and helpful. Service is pretty prompt and food is tasty for anyone wanting to eat seafood, everything tastes pretty fresh.  With the crab we got the trifecta sauce at number 3 which wasnt spicy at all anyone who likes spicy i would say go for the number 5."}
{"text":"We've been to the chandler location twice.Nothing fancy but all the food is excellent. A great casual eatery for family or friends. Everything we tried was excellent. Not one negative. For food or service. They help first timers to order. We don't go hot we go mild or less and it's delicious. All positives for this location and we don't hesitate. To go there ever!"}
{"text":"TraditIonal seafood boil that you customize.  We had shrimp sausage red potatoes corn cajun fries cole slaw fried catfish. All very good but messy"}
{"text":"SO I go into this place really not knowing what to expect and was blown away.  The food was frickin' delicious... Like, fat kid who goes against his budding moral compass and sneaks fries out of his family's fast food bag because they foolishly trusted him to hold it on the drive home good.  I don't normally go for greasy, messy food but I could do nothing all all to stop eating to avoid the food coma I felt coming on after getting over wearing a bib.

MOST impressive though, is that I couldn't get over the fact that I couldn't figure out who the manager was by body language because EVERYONE seemed to really hold customer service very important.  Everyone was attentive.  They all seemed invested.  I put a reminder in my phone to grab a coupon when Local Dines had another one.  Greedy! Right? LOL  That good."}
{"text":"This was a great place. Messy but worth it. Not a date night dinner unless you don't mind getting messy in front of your date. Every one else is perfect. They serve the seafood by the pound. A pound of shrimp was enough for two people. We also had the sausage and sweet potato fries. I highly recommend dipping the fries in the sauce from the seafood.  Wow. I loved the coating on the fries and with the sauce they were perfect.  My tummy was very happy. I can't wait to try more food there!!! Server was extremely attentive. Everyone worked as a team.  Believe me there were no angry crabs in this place. They were all very happy!!"}
{"text":"First time at Angry Crab Shack tonight. Arrived at 7 on a Friday and waited 45 mins. They have a cool app that shows your place on the list so you won't miss your turn. 

The six of us were seated and soon greeted by Alexia. She took excellent care of us all night. We ordered: 4 pounds of shrimp, two pound of mussels, two pounds of snow crab, a full rack of rib and a pound of catfish. We also got Gator bites and Cajun Fries plus a couple of red potatoes. After two rounds of drinks it came to $220 or about $37 per person plus tip. We had a lot of leftovers. 

I had the Gator and Snow Crab. Since I ordered my crab with '#3 hot' sauce, Alexa recommended I get my gator in buffalo sauce. It was better that way. The crab was boiled in a bag (like all other non-BBQ dishes) and the seasoning was added in. Great flavor. The shrimps came unpeeled as well. 

Messy but good. It was very loud in the ACS and there were a lot of celebrations going on, so we just shouted thru our meal. 

Good, fun place to go but not on date-night: too messy and too loud."}
{"text":"I loved that the kids kept busy by drawing on the paper that served as a table cloth or in this case, table paper. The service was great, our waitress was super nice and attentive. 

The food is not as flavorful as Joe's Crab Shack which was a big let down. From the car park the food smells amazing so we were expecting really delicious food. The king crab was good but expensive. Those plastic bags they serve the crabs in look unappetizing and should really think of a better way to serve them. Really not sure if we will eat here again."}
{"text":"Service was great from the moment you walk to the time you leave. I went for the first time about a week ago and went back the next night with some other friends. The food is really priced well and then portion size is enough to have left over. But let's be honest, leftovers are for suckers. I recommend this place to everyone who likes seafood and BBQ."}
{"text":"I came here with my sister today and I have to say I was thoroughly impressed! Crab was really fresh and tasty. We got the dungenous crab with the trifecta sauce. We also got the snow crab legs. If you like spicy be careful because they are very spicy and hotter than normal recipes! The inside is exactly what I expect when I go to a Louisiana style crab restaurant. Overall I would go again, the atmosphere was really fun and upbeat. The food was great.  If it's you're birthday you get a free dessert. The only negative comment I have to say is if it's your \"birthday\" they yell and sound the siren they play over the entire restaurant and it's obnoxious and loud and tonight .. it seemed to be everyone's birthday haha."}
{"text":"This place is a blast-  And the food is seriously amazing!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST place to have crab in AZ! Don't brother with Red Lobster ever again!! My typical order: 1 pound of Snow crab, trifecta #1 with red potatoes, corn and sausage. And a corona. YUM!!"}
{"text":"I went with a group of 5 and we where looking forward to eating here and from all the good reviews I had some expectations. But I was really disappointed with the food and so was everyone else that was in my group. We started off with the hush puppies and the frog legs. The hush puppies where probably the only good thing about this whole meal. The frog legs were... well its a frog so not that good lol.  We then ordered shrimp lemon pepper, snow crab garlic and crawfish with their trifecta sauce all mild. All i gotta say is that there sauces literally are all butter with no flavor or anything. We could see where the butter and the seasoning where separating and it just didn't look that appetizing. I suggest maybe mixing it better?  Even with the trifecta sauce that everyone is raving about it was just so plain and not as flavorful as i thought.. Also we found out that the crawfish we ordered was frozen!!! We didn't know we got to have the choice of fresh over frozen because our waitress did not tell us anything. All we said was crawfish and i guess she assumed we would want frozen? I would think they would want to sell the fresh over frozen ones... if we would of known We would of totally ordered the fresh ones over the frozen anyway so we just sent the crawfish back since no one touched them after we heard they were frozen. We also got some sides of cornbread that where honestly the 2nd best thing we ate right after the hush puppies. 
To be completely honest the whole time i was eating here i was wishing it was Hot N Juicy because their sauces are just a million times better. This place and Hot n Juicy doesn't compare. I just don't understand why people are raving about this place. if you want really good seafood with to die for sauce you gotta get it at Hot n Juicy!!!

2 stars because of the hush puppies and corn bread if we didn't order those I would probably be giving it a 1 star."}
{"text":"Recently visited for dinner!!  Love love loved their food!  We had the snow crab, mussels, crawfish and oysters on the half shell!!  Oysters were some of the best I've had in the valley!  Great size!  The restaurant was busy when we got there so we sat at the bar, the bartender was super helpful and friendly, plus they have some great beers on tap!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Such a great concept for Arizona! I have been there four times, each time introducing the restaurant to new people. The shrimp and snow crab are my favorite! I love that you can choose your sauce and heat level, something for everyone!  The seafood is fresh and fun to eat. Great for kids and non-seafood lovers also. The Cornish hen is so good and just one of the unique items on the menu. It's a great place for large parties or a fun date night. You have to try it!!"}
{"text":"Not sure how anyone can give this place four or five stars. The fried dishes and BBQ are mostly horrible, and I've had nearly everything on the menu at different times. The meat is always overcooked, and the fried dishes always taste like they've been fried in the same oil they were using when they opened the place. The only reason I've given this place three stars is to recognize the efforts of the hard-working serving staff who consistently do an outstanding job and for the restaurant's relaxed ambiance. Some people here report customer service problems, but I've never experienced that.

The only dishes I would recommend are 1) the gumbo, 2) any of the seafood bags with the trifecta, and 3) that's about it since they stopped serving oysters. I'm waiting for the IPA (aka, turpentine) craze to die down so I can finally recommend the local beer list. They served me a Four Peaks Oatmeal Stout once, probably a limited holiday batch, that was awesome, but the rest of the list is not particularly impressive given the number of good beers brewed locally, and weighted heavily on the IPA side."}
{"text":"First time ever at an Angry Crab.  Not a good experience.  First they brought out a basket for my young niece that was suppose to be chicken tenders.  It turned out to be my fried cod basket.  Someone brought out the basket and placed it right in front of her, so we thought she knew what she was doing.   This person wasn't the same as the one who took our order. When we told the waitress that my cod had been given to my niece, she asked \"well, what do you want me to do?\"  She was serious!  She had no idea what to do.  For a minute I seriously thought she wanted me to take the basket my niece had just picked over and eaten from!  They then brought out the fried oysters we ordered for appetizers and the chicken basket for my niece.  The oysters were good, but lacked seasoning.  My sister ordered a chicken basket.  The chicken was extremely dry and she sent it back for a shrimp basket. I finally got my cod and it would have been good if they had only seasoned the coating.  My boyfriend liked his gumbo and catfish.  I tasted a piece of his catfish and it was seasoned better than my cod.  Oh, and they sat us at the booth right next to bathroom.  Some girl kept going in there to throw up.  She may have been pregnant, or something.  That may have contributed to my whole awful experience.  We didn't like that they brought out the meal at intervals.  Instead of everything together, except for appetizer, of course.  They did comp for the dry chicken, to be fair."}
{"text":"This Place Is Amazing! Everything Was Perfect And Our Waitress Was Really Nice And Helpful. 
Definitely Coming Back On My Next Trip To Arizona.."}
{"text":"We started with the raw oysters which were phenomenally fresh and large.    I got a crab leg bucket and hubs got soft shell basket.   They were both o.k., nothing I would write home about.   The only problem was that they were timed wrong and my husband was completely finished by the time my food arrived so he ended up ordering an appetizer to eat while I ate my dinner.   He had the alligator which compared to the times we have had it in the past seemed to be fried too hard and the pieces cut too large.   The only thing bumping it to 3 stars is that our server Dion was great, on point every time and really seemed to be concerned about our dining experience.   Other servers would pop in and see if we needed anything....service seems to be perfect here."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend this place, awesome! Love the crab legs and shrimp, drinks are pretty good too."}
{"text":"First off i thought the food was great but the better than that was our server  her name was Christine and let me tell you she was GREAT AMAZING ..she was all over the place as it was a very busy night i know we were not her only table but we never had to ask anyone else for one single thing she was on FIRE really wonderful food drinks great but if you want to be treated the way you should be when going out and paying for your dinner go the the Angry Crab Phoenix location and sit in Christine's section she makes the dinner even better 
Thank you"}
{"text":"Came in around 2:00 on a Thursday and place was just about empty, 3-4 tables max had people in them. Appeared to be just one server which I can understand being a lull in the day. However, manager just stood around wouldn't help. We waited for a drink order for at least 15 minutes. Ordered a dozen raw oysters, most were slimy and snotting, most likely frozen and not fresh. Still no utensils to even use the cocktail sauce. Food all came out at different times, spread minutes apart. Shrimp po boy had no flavor, bland greasy shrimp. Bag of shrimp and crab was dirty and still not given any crackers to break open. Beer tasted bad from the bleaching of glasses in wash. Won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and had a good personality. The salmon and catfish was pretty good but not amazing. The gumbo was excellent. The steamed veggies were a little underdone but the coleslaw was fresh and creamy.  Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Good fresh seafood in phoenix? Awwwww yeeeeee
Go for the shrimp, they're massive juicy and fresh. The trifrecta seasoning is the way to go!!! The blue crab isn't very fresh though so a star off, but amazing seafood otherwise! 
Also $4 draft 20 oz kilt lifters? Totally a good deal!!"}
{"text":"So my family and I came to celebrate my moms bday here on a Wednesday and let's just say We enjoyed it. We had to wait for about 25 min and they send u a text msg when there's a table ready. We all enjoyed it especially My mama bear. My sister and I got the 1 pound of shrimp (they do wholes so u can't do half pounds) with added extras of the 4 sausages for $1 something and 50 cents a corn. We got the trifecta seasoning which is a combination of The top 3 flavored they have and mild for spice. The mild was just perfect it was pretty spicy for level one of spicyness. (If that's even a word haha) we also got rice which was a plus for me being an islander hahaa! My mom got the crab Dungeness which is a 2 pounder and she LOVED IT. My brother got the Po Boy sandwich with the fries. He said it was good but their sauce on it was EXTREMELY HOT. They're a bit pricey but that was expected. I will definitely be returning soon. Thank you for filling up our Bellys!"}
{"text":"This place was busy, so be prepared to wait in line.  This place has tons of energy and food.  I found the sauce quite salty and would recommend you have the seafood boiled with dipping sauces on the side.  But everything was ordered and plenty were merry with all the different dishes/sauces."}
{"text":"Best best best crab legs and gumbo ever!!! I will not go anywhere else! Everyone is always so friendly. Did I mention best gumbo ever?!"}
{"text":"Excellent for seafood. It's hard to find a good selection of seafood in Phoenix, but, this place has found the secret and brought to our area. I had the catfish boil. This done in a bag with veggies and a mild spice. The menu allows for a multitude of variations of style if cooking and spice selections from 0 to 5. I had the 1 spice mine was very warm. Not sure if I could handle a 5. Menu includes crabs, lobster, clams, mussels, shrimp, crayfish and crab legs.  I will visit again.  I'm sure that after a few more food trials this could be a 5 star establishments."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for our birthday lunch on a weekday. It wasn't crowded at all. Maybe no one wants to get really messy and smelly... then, go back to work. The host/server was Jake. He provided excellent service! Definitely ask for him. We ordered the hush puppies, two pounds of Dungeness crab, one pound of shrimp, four sausages, two corns and two potatoes. We did the trifecta and medium hot. Everything was delicious! Jake even cracked the crab for us. It's a fun experience to fight for your food! Literally! And, for dessert we had the cheesecake and bourbon pecan pie. Delicious! And, the bonus - you consume enough garlic to ward off vampires! I would recommend Angry Crab Shack."}
{"text":"Can you say yum? We have heard a lot of good things and wanted to try it out and I am glad we did, everything we had was so good! The seafood was so fresh and good . Be careful though it gets hot, I felt wimpy getting the number 2 but am glad I did it was the perfect amount of heat, we did the trifecta and was happy we choose it. Also tried the hush puppies these are a must just the right amount of jalapenos, great atmosphere, the kids enjoyed how messy everything was, and it really is, but they give you bibs and have a sink in the dining room to wash up."}
{"text":"Angry Crab Shack is great for seafood boils and pretty good for oysters on the half shell. I had the lobster and hubby had King Crab. Both were amazing. I had no sauce or spice but it still had my lips and tounge tingling, must be pot residue. Yes, I don't do much hot spice. As we waited for a table I was amazed at how many tables sat empty ( for 15 minutes or more) while dozens of people waiting outside.  Many were 6 person tables that could have accommodated 4 person groups. In the Midwest the host would have filled most of those tables and not made people wait unnecessarily."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was great. It was a nice enough time until the end of the dinner. I had a good view of the kitchen staff celebrating something and the resulting dust cloud that washed over them a cook banged on one of the overheads. I'm just glad that I got my food before all that particulate ended up on every surface."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb.  We bring all our visitors here.  They have good fresh seafood at very reasonable prices.  We like to get the trifecta seasoning mild.  You go here for the food and the fun environment.  I have been several times and will be back several times."}
{"text":"The food was good, but our server neglected us for the most part and offered us nothing to compensate for my wife's food arriving after everyone else was almost finished eating."}
{"text":"Let's do this.    We order the same thing Everytime.  One pound of headless shrimp, 2 corn on the Cobb, and sausage.  (TRIFECTA 2 Thick thick( you have to tell them thick) and sweet potato fries and a side of ranch.   It comes in a bag of love and happiness.  Heaven.  Homerun. I'll stand by this review."}
{"text":"I always love eating here. The food is amazing and the service is even better. Dil is my fave employee."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the loudest restaurants we have been in. We overall had a bad table but oh well, the food was OK, oysters were great, gumbo was just so so, and I had the Po Boy that wasn't, sorry folks but a Po Boy is not 4 fried shrimp on a massive 4 inch thick bun with coleslaw stuffed in it. I ate the shrimp. Not likely going back to this one."}
{"text":"BBQ and seafood is amazing.  Jeff, Maura and Mike behind the bar are awesome. One huge suggestion: please put salads in the menu and do away with the pizzas"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the food here is absolutely amazing.   They have several different types of sauces all available in different levels of hotness.   I can highly recommend the clams, crab,  and lobster.   Very friendly service with a solid selection of craft beers."}
{"text":"We were immediately taken aback by the cold, uncaring greeting by the hostess(es) and waitresses when we walked in. We'd never been here before and wanted to have a great first experience where we weren't sat in a corner, facing a wall in a side room. We asked if we could have a booth or a table out near the middle where we could see the TV's and be part of the experience. We got a serious eye-roll and some Additional bad attitude. Honestly, wanted to walk out at that point. But, we were on date night and wanted to make the best of it. I'm glad we did, read on....

Service: Our waiter was great. He was honest and friendly and knowledgable about the menu and restaurant. He was attentive and took great care of us. If it weren't for the exceptionally poor \"face of the business\" (hostess), the service would have been rated higher. I'd give it 3 out of 5.

Food: it was excellent. The shrimp, potatoes and corn on the Cobb served in the bag was fantastic!! The sauce (trifecta) was awesome on all of it! The bbq brisket was outstanding!! We were very surprised at the quality and quantity of the bbq at a restaurant that doesn't exclusively serve bbq, really excellent! 4.5 out of 5.

Price: we were surprised that with beer, bbq, seafood and a couple sides we were still only around $50. 3.5 out of 5

Atmosphere: It's a weird location at the end of a relatively hidden strip mall the building and the entry around the side/back. This makes it kind of cool because it's a \"local hidden gem\". It's fun inside with the wait staff yelling out at times, a bell rung at times, TV's and lots of people enjoying great food in a fun way. 4 out of 5

I can't think of another place with better seafood and served in such a fun, hands on way,...including bibs, butcher paper covering the tables, galvanized trash buckets, no plates or silverware, and gloves if you want them,....really, really fun! Excellent seafood! And, great bbq.

I'd go again, often if I could. Looking forward to taking the kids. I highly recommend trying this place. Maybe it'll become a favorite for you too."}
{"text":"Prices higher than Red Lobster and quality of food one step above Long John Silvers. It was a huge disappointment! You walk in and it has a authentic west coast feel but, the quality of food was very poor. Ordered the gumbo and I believe it was canned and if it wasn't then I have had better canned gumbo. It was very slimy and just resembled brown muck. Not appealing! Fried oysters tasted canned with a metallic aftertaste. The shrimp PO'Boy had 4 popcorn shrimp with blankets of breading on a large roll. The coleslaw was average nothing special. The brisket sandwich was dry and over done and the bread fell apart before we could even pick it up.  I am afraid to order Lobster or crab as it would be a big waste of money. Sorry but not worth the money!"}
{"text":"Never having been here before, the menu was a little confusing. The waitress explained it and I chose the mixed bag with the trifecta mild. Apparently the mix changes daily. Mine had snow crab, cod, shrimp and a variety of veggies and one piece of pineapple. I point out the pineapple because the pineapple with the spices was wonderful! I wanted more!!! 

My friend had dungeonous crab trifecta medium. Medium has a good kick. It too was awesome.  

The way it's served is literally in a plastic bag with a bucket for your scraps. The eating style is very messy - thank goodness for the bib and nearby sink to wash up in. The food was delicious!!! Neither of us finished our meals but who doesn't love leftovers!?

Fun environment. Don't wear clothes you're afraid of getting dirty. My friend ended up with trifecta sauce on her white pants. Ruh roh!

Also - don't go if you're in a hurry. It's just not that kind of spot. Do write on the wall!"}
{"text":"I love discovering a new, awesome restaurant in my hometown!. The Angry Crab Shack delivered on multiple levels and I already can't wait to go back. All kinds of fresh seafood served in shells in bags with varied levels of spiciness and multiple sauce choices. Wow the king crab was incredible! The blue crab was almost as good... the oysters alone will make me come back; possibly the biggest and juiciest i've ever had. As a transplant from the east coast, this Cajun seafood paradise is a must hit! Also worth mentioning is the servers and the hostess were on their game and I felt a sense of team oriented customer service. Great food, great service, see you soon."}
{"text":"Service was fast and attentive the food was absolutely awesome I don't really suggest anything above a stage 3 in he level and then try the for and believe the burned a hole straight through my stomach down to well you know where the shrimp were perfectly cooked head on in the goodies you can add and just add to it definitely suggest this place if you don't mind getting messy"}
{"text":"Seems like they're losing it a bit.  We went around 2pm which I would've expected it to be slower but it wasn't.  It didn't take long before we were seated but they said something like someone will be with you as soon as they can......  Turned out to be a little longer than I thought, but once the contact was made things moved a bit quickly and fairly smoothly. 

He forgot to offer us bibs and my friend got sauce splattered on his shirt.  He also came through to clear our table without checking with us first so we were basically told we were done eating.  It was just so quick we couldn't stop him before he put garbage on our tray. 

Seems like it was either they were short handed somehow or the waiter was just antsy and not organized.  The place wasn't full but busier than I would've thought at 2.  Excuses aside, they still have a fairly good product at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Very good coleslaw, large shrimp.  Hearty lunch!!  Great service, friendly environment.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Our second visit to this place was so much better. The food was never the issue our first time. It is delicious then and delicious now!!!!  It was the service. It was unorganized and slow. But this time around it was on point. Our orders were correct, even after we changed one of them afterwards. We were attended to very well. Excellent!!  Love this place for seafood!"}
{"text":"Coming from Louisiana i have high expectations of what real canjun food taste like . The LIVE crawfish was outstanding and perfectly boiled and seasoned .OMG  i cant believe how i felt like i was down in good ole N.O.Harland was an amazing bartender and worked the front door greeting new comers and still kept his eye on the bar where absolutley no one had to wait for a drink or refill .I definitley will return and give those crawfish another run for the money !! Thumbs up to the entire crew who worked that day because everyone seemed to be a team player
I have No  problem spreading the word to my other canjun friends to check this place out !"}
{"text":"Such a fun place to go for dinner! You eat your meal from a bag! It was a fun and unique experience! The service was great and the price was right. Be warned though; there are no serving utensils. You eat with hands so be sure to not wear white and don't have any cuts. The Trifecta Sauce was awesome but if you love curry get the Pacific Rim sauce. To. Die. For."}
{"text":"Love this place fast when u order and the food is so delicious .. Highly recommended... Worth it"}
{"text":"I dig this place for a yummy casual seafood dinner with family and friends. This is NOT fancy, think bibs, paper towels and buckets for the shells. Seafood is bought by the pound and there are a host of flavors that can be added or mixed and then a heat level assigned. I really enjoy the trifecta sauce which is fat based, the traditional boil which is water based and the Pacific rim is a yummy fat based seasoning that is a little different (tastes of coconut and curry) if you are feeling adventurous. The sides are purchased separately, I enjoy getting an order of the veggies included in my boil. My little is 3 and enjoys the shrimp or the sliders. I haven't ordered the plates or dishes but my parents did and they enjoyed them very much. Check them out and if you don't wanna peel your own shrimp, they will do it for you for a slight up charge. Totally worth it if you just wanna eat."}
{"text":"The Angry Crab almost made me angry... almost...  I guess that I should be fair here and let everyone know that I am from the South, so my expectations were high.  As soon as I saw it on the menu, I knew what I wanted.  Crawfish!  So I got a pound with the sausage add-on.  I was disappointed to find that about 20% of the crawfish in the bag was missing its tail.  No bueno for crawfish!  That would be like riding a bike that doesn't have tires!  Of the remaining mudbugs, I found them to be dirty in flavor.  You have to purge these things and I just think they missed that step.  The restaurant was fun, the style was appropriate for the cuisine.  Next time, I think I will stick to something a little easier to prepare and enjoy the atmosphere a little more."}
{"text":"Great service. Decent wait times. I've lived in this neighborhood for 8 years and this is the first restaurant in that spot to survive and be packed every night! The potato salad is amaZing! I recommend the trifecta sauce with a medium spice. They also have great cocktails."}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  The first impression walking into the restaurant with all the graffiti and writing on the walls, not impressed.  I understand they are trying to accomplish a theme. However, I don't think it's working.

Our first waiter was excellent, however over the course of the next hour, we went through 4 waiters.  My wife and I weren't fond of the seafood in a bag thing, frankly, had never heard of it before.

We had five employees ask us what we thought about the place, and I'm not surprised.  During our stay, had six tables seated around us and they were all first-time customers.  I suspect that very few people ever come back for a second time.  Not that it's terrible, but just not what most people are looking for in a dining experience.

We left and went to Texas Roadhouse.... Service and food excellent as always.  Told our waiter that we weren't too terribly hungry, that we had just left Angry Crab Shack.  She laughed and said, yep, been there before.  Not a place she was impressed with either and had no intention of returning. Interesting."}
{"text":"Deliciousness at its finest!  Have someone in your party arrive early to get on the list, otherwise you'll be waiting awhile for a table.  After being seated and ordering, food arrives quickly and customized to your liking.  

I ordered the medium on my veggies but they were quite spicy. If you don't like a lot of spice, go with mild or the butter sauce.   Everything is a la carte, but portions of the side dishes are definitely large enough to share with several people. 
No kids menu to speak of, so our daughter got dessert for dinner....not a bad thing in her eyes.  

Service was excellent"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Delicious seafood, steamed to order-- you pick the spice and sauce and wha-la  you have yourself the best tasting seafood in all of Arizona. This place is amazing. Great service too. Can get a little busy on Fridays/Saturdays and also seems like a place people go to celebrate birthdays. My go to is the snow crab with trifecta sauce (mild!)."}
{"text":"Great place for boiled seafood. Love the mussels and shrimp. Get the trifecta seasoning, I like medium spice. Be prepared to wear the bib they provide since it can get messy, but that's half the fun. Good fries too. Try adding potatoes, corn and sausage to your seafood bag. Yum! If you find space on the walls, add your name. They even have a sink in the dining area to wash your hands after."}
{"text":"It's crawfish season so I stopped in to see if they had live crawfish to boil. They did! Ordered 2 lbs of the Cajun boil, hot. They came out piping hot and the flavor was perfect. Not too spicy but perfect. They were so good I ordered another 2 lbs. The crawfish were good sized too.  I give them 4 stars for their boiled live crawfish. If you like boiled crawfish stop here. Nows the time, it's Crawfish season!"}
{"text":"pretty sure this is an imitation of Boiling Crab from Southern California, but Cajun seafood nonetheless is still awesome.

Had the shrimp po'boy: good, but nothing special. The cajun fries are pretty awesome, though.
My friend had the mussels in the #2 sauce with corn and sausage and he was pretty damn satisfied with his meal. He also did have an oyster shooter, two beers, and a shot on a Sunday morning so overall, he was in a good mood.

Our waitress, Shelby, was awesome. Super helpful and funny.

Good selection of beer gives this place a star.

If you've had Boiling Crab before, then this place is comparable and with better beer selection. It's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"This was our first time at this location and we were celebrating a friend's birthday...Cheyenne, our waitperson, was very nice and competent...The food was great and we had a good time!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Disappointed with the wait at another cajun place (Flavors of Louisiana .. only one person in front of me but I waited more than 5 minutes (!) only to have her tell me when it was finally my turn that I would have to wait an additional 10 minutes for gumbo to be prepared! Crap! That is WAY TOO LONG to have to wait on one little ol' cup of gumbo! Sheesh.

I digress. 

Let's get back to the topic of Angry Crab (Goodyear locale). They saved the day!! I was so Put Out, I half expected to get some bad news when i went in to order but instead, they made me very happy, gave me a sharpie so i could add my name to the graffiti, and made the order in something under 10 mins. Oh! and they made my son some really good drink he loved while we waited. Thanks, AC, for satisfying my strong gumbo craving this afternoon. And for fixing my bad mood."}
{"text":"Parking is iffy if your coming for dinner lots of places in the area.  Came in before the dinner rush, was seated immediately.  Wife ordered the shrimp and I the brisket. The food arrives in a bag, cooked in a traditional  creole boil style. The seafood is very busy,  whole pieces that require work to get the meat out. The staff are very educational if you are not seafood savy. The brisket was goid, not top of the line. Nice char, lots of flavor. Tried the creole bbq sauce, slight spice with a strong hint of mustard. An overall enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Had by far the best experience I have had at a restaurant! Food was amazing and service was top notch. Great atmosphere! Natasha helped us out with all the little sea critters we didn't know how to eat and also gave us great suggestions. Hands down will return hungry and ready for more."}
{"text":"So I came back with a friend to give it another try. This time I got there a little late (9:20PM) so I was almost expecting them to be out of seafood again. I ran into some friends outside who had some opinions about the food but the only one that affected me was their comment on the oysters they got. My friend had told me they had intentions to have the oysters and my friends were telling me they were sandy and poorly prepped. I don't know how it slipped my mind but my friend ended up getting the oysters and only eating two before giving up. I got the trifecta shrimp which was fine. But while I was ordering they of course went through what they didn't have yet again. I'm not sure that's how these restaurants work but I'm glad they had shrimp thawed out this time. Service was ok. The one screw up was that we got a side of rice and it was overlooked and was sitting in the service window before we had to ask for it. Really, I thought the food was good but I can't deal with the place. If it's a gamble every time I order then I can't possibly recommend it to anyone. Maybe third time's a charm. Or maybe I'll have to wait for hot and juicy to open up."}
{"text":"I'm not always the first on the band wagon, but I try to catch up. Finally made it here and  my experience was nearly perfect. The atmosphere and ambiance are total chill, but in a real way. Service was exceptional, especially our server Nate. Most of the food was right on and seasoned perfectly. The crab legs, veggies, grilled shrimp and hush puppies rocked. Unfortunately, my nephew said his catfish was a bit soft and my sister-in-law said she's had better Po Boys (well, she lived in NO for a while, so she knows her Po Boys).  Everything else was so great that these slight imperfections were overlooked. The super rich, dark chocolate cake was consumed rapidly. This is a really fun place with great food. Oh, great for kids too because everyone is allowed to be messy here."}
{"text":"We went there for a girls night out.  I was afraid of a long wait so we went for early dinner at 5pm.  We were seated promptly.  The server was ok, average.

We are all seafood lovers so ordered shrimp, crawfish, mussels, clams and blue crabs.  Mussels and clams were good, shrimp and crawfish were ok, DO NOT order the blue crabs.  The crabs were not fresh at all.  Even with the heavy old bay seasoning it still taste bad.  For $21 per pound (approx. 2 crabs), it was a waste.  

I would try somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Was not thrilled by any margin. Fried Seafood was mediocre at best, but priced decently. Cornbread doesn't even rate. Screwed up my beer order, then held both my girlfriend and I's beers for ten minutes because \"an orange crisis\" when neither of us cared about an orange slice. Her food was fast, my food came out ten minutes after hers, I had gotten the shrimp. Which came, in a bag. With 1/2 a corn cob, in the bag. Shells still on the shrimp. For $25... No silverware/plastic ware/gloves offered. I'd understand the price if it was served with any semblance of ease but this was not the case. It came served as if I walked into a ran down Chinese buffet where I could have ate more for $10 with less work and better service."}
{"text":"I will always keep coming back here because the majority of the time it taste awesome and it's priced well. Sadly my visit last Thursday was not up to par. My husband and I went for lunch. We usually do lunch on the weekends, this was a first to go there during the week. The service was pretty good. My husbands crab tasted pretty good, a lot more flavor this time. I had gotten a 1lb of brisket. I'm not a big fan of their sides that come with the BBQ. I tried to order onion rings and potato salad but my server stated I can order onion rings in lew of the 2 sides that I get to pick from their small collection of sides. My husband got his food a good 10 minutes before I received mine. Half of my brisket was well over cooked and extremely dry. I didn't even have 10 onion rings, even though I'm technically paying for 2 sides and only getting 1. I don't know if the difference between my experiences are because of the week vs. weekend but I know I will never go during a weekday again."}
{"text":"They served us lobster, 1 1/2lbs @ $21 per pound. We ordered 2lbs King crab legs at $28 per pound. We added a potato and a corn on the cob for each of us. Each dinner came complete in one bag full of a spicy sauce, supposedly the mildest they had. They provided one pair of scissors, one crunching tool, and a rock, yes, a rock, to break open our food. No plates or utensils so we asked and we're given plastic forks and knives. Strange cave man style of eating it, imo. Just used our hands, pretty much. You either try to eat out of the bag or just eat it off your paper table 'cloth'. Everything was buried in a spicy, chili pepper-type sauce, which didn't marry well to the seafood. Mouth was burning as if I was eating a spicy Mecican type dish. Asked for butter which we were charged for, but it wasn't real butter. It was a butter-flavored oil similar to the butter topping one would get on popcorn in a movie theater. It was bland, oily, with no salt. Lots of meat but the spicy sauce clashed with the seafood too much for us. We ate it all but honestly we would rather eat at Joes Crab Shack. With tip it came to $123."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful dinner which included a plate of pulled pork, coleslaw, BBQ beans & salmon over rice. 
Atmosphere is loud due to poor acoustics. Sign your name and tag the walls if you wish. Spirited place, great food and friendly service. Great BBQ taste. 
Be sure to try their Margarita special."}
{"text":"First time at angry crab and all 12 in our party enjoyed it and will go again. It's messy and its loud but the food is great and the experience is unique. We highly recommend adding the sausage and potatoes to the boil. The trifecta sauce is the best too! We went at 5:30 which we thought was early enough to get in with a party of 12 but we ended up waiting 45-60 minutes. Still worth it for the experience. So happy something good and fun has made it to Goodyear."}
{"text":"So I just got back from eating at the Angry Crab and I have to say after seeing the prices the crab ain't the only thing that's angry.  I know businesses are trying to make money but this place is ridiculous.  Don't order the cornbread it cost a dollar in the damn thing was a little bit bigger then my thumb. I thought it was a joke at first but they were serious. It seems the more a place charges the more customers they get. I dont understand it. The food really wasn't good enough to justify the prices they charge. But at the same time I encourage everybody to at least try something once just because I feel this way about this place don't mean you will. But at the end of the day it's going to boil down to whether you want to make that house payment car payment or have a plate of food from this place lol"}
{"text":"This is a decent restaurant/bar. The seafood menu is a bit confusing so be sure to ask your server to explain the details. My husband had the pulled pork sandwich with traditional BBQ sauce. It had a strong vinegar smell and taste which he enjoyed. I had the 1/2 pound brisket which was A LOT of food. Good place to watch a football/basketball games as their are plenty of TV's around the restaurant."}
{"text":"Service, food are Awesome
Atmosphere too I feel good to bring my kiddos 
I love the trifecta over shrimp"}
{"text":"It was my friend's graduation from college, and she, having lived in Louisiana, wanted something authentic. We picked Angry Crab on 28th street.  The atmosphere is awesome and authentic, and we had a good time. Unfortunately, the food was good, but less than amazing. She told me that the breading on her shrimp was so thick, that there was no shrimp taste. Her mother had the catfish, which she liked, and her dad had the BBQ which was good but not memorable. So, in summary, I think GOOD, SOLID, AUTHENTIC are the words that best describe the food and experience. However, for what we spent, I would have hoped for a more tasty experience, meaning that the flavors should be less heavy and should be more refined and distinct. And finally, for me, I will probably seek a new place rather than visit again."}
{"text":"Best Crab Shack In Phoenix! Hands down! Everytime my family and I eat at ACS we are greeted with friendly service and seated right away. It can be busy at times but the environment is well Lit! Definitely a Great Place To eat At."}
{"text":"Love love love this location and the food. The sea food is great. And the drinks are wonderful."}
{"text":"This place has a lot going on! And it was all great!  We were sat quickly even though they were busy. Next our server was so sweet and patient. It was our first time so she took the time to explain the WHILE menu to us newbies. So patient with my kids too which I loved.  We had king crab, shrimp , chicken fingers, brisket and frog legs. All so yummy! Good prices too. And the icing on the cake...my one year old's  shoe fell off under the table and one of the guys chased us in the parking lot to give it back! One of the best dining experiences I have ever had!!!"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for some Cajun and this definitely hit the spot!  It's a little messy, so probably don't bring someone here on a first date."}
{"text":"First visit was great. After a few recommendations from friends to stop in, I wanted to try a taste. The boiled pound of jumbo shrimp and corn on the cob in the mild sauce hit the spot. Friendly bartender was a nice plus. Families seemed to enjoy the fun birthday atmosphere. Thanks for a good dinner experience."}
{"text":"I'm an idiot for suggesting this place as a first date....you will get messy! I ordered the snow crab legs in the trifecta sauce with the #2 (medium) spiciness. Woo! I like spicy, but I should've gotten the mild #1! Delicious, but my nose was running and I was struggling lol. I'm glad they opened this location because it's so close and convenient. Anyways, this was the first time I had ever gotten snow crab. The king crab (which is usually what I go for at any seafood restaurant) was a tad pricey, so I passed and decided to try something different. Nothing compares to king crab legs, but the snow crab was a close second! I got the sausage added in there and that was also very good! I'm glad I stumbled on this place...it's seriously a fantastic spot if you're in the mood for good seafood."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I didn't actually eat here. A friend had a party and I showed up really late. I had some drinks tho and still glanced over the menu and remnants of what had been left from everyone else. This place has a pretty cool vibe, the employees are nice, and it's just an overall pretty cool place. I'll definitely come back and enjoy a meal instead of just drinking."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place when it first opened prices were Fair for drinks and food service was amazing especially the bartenders but whatever has happened recently it has changed their owner sits around and acts like he's the king of the world and yet the menus are disgustingly torn apart and I'm sure a safety hazard prices have skyrocketed the amount of crab you get has gone down sadly to say one of our favorite places we will no longer be back see a picture of the menu up in the photos"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd Angry Crab experience,  and it's as good as the 1st time.  It doesn't seem to matter which location. They are all good."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. 
The waitstaff is energetic and informative.  Our waiter kept us checking on us through-out our meal.  It was great.  The decor is inviting and not over the top and they sport a large bar in the center of the restaurant.  But the best part.. is the food.  It's messy and yummy!  The portions are enough to feed 2.  What more can I say?  Try it for yourself."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and the atmosphere is better. The trifecta seasoning is the way to go. Servers are fun and upbeat. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"What a fun experience! Reminded me of blue crab feeds on the Potomac. We just dumped our Dungeness crab, king crab, shrimp and crawdads out on the table and dug in. The seafood seemed fresh enough. The trifecta sauce was really good. Just a messy good old time. Our server Max was very attentive. We'll be back at some future trip to Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"We are from the Pacific NW and we know seafood.  The king crab legs were fantastic!!!  Service was excellent.  Tables were clean.  My husband had the \"wimpy kajun\" he said he would kick it up another notch or two, for me I thought it was very favorable.  I had the butter and garlic and I LOVE garlic, it was delicious but even I would say \"WHOA, back off a touch on the garlic\".  Leave the corn alone, the sausage was very good and we also had the steamed veggies, were also very good and plenty for two or even three people. Hope you like Rock n Roll, good music is being played, good smells roaming around and very friendly staff.  Yup, we will return."}
{"text":"Best fresh seafood and atmosphere and reasonably priced. Ask for Kat and Val. Excellent service and cheerful workers who look like they're having a blast working. Definitely will be going back and spreading the word."}
{"text":"Probably the worst service I've ever had. Bartender has 6 customers and everyone is waitng. He took my daughter's drink order but not mine. He didn't acknowledge us, and we got so tired of waiting,  we left without ordering the food we wanted. Lots of servers just standing around. THE BATHROOM IS DISGUSTING."}
{"text":"So glad that my friend & I decided to try Angry Crab which is literally across the street from where I live. Sunday Pre.Labor Day Eve & the place was crack.a.lackin!! Luckily there were spots at the bar for us. Bartenders were very friendly. Drinks served quickly & made sure our glasses were never empty.  Order a dozen raw oysters to start with-very fresh & tasty. I ordered the clams mild \"trifecta\" sauce-deeelicious!!  I also ordered onion rings as well-hot & crunchy. My friend ordered the Alligator basket w/beans. Alligator was yummy but the beans were a bit cold. I told my friend to send it back, but he was ok w/room temp baker beans. Great atmosphere & busy to say the least.  I've been to a similar place in San Diego that was ok. Definitely coming back to try other items on the menu!!"}
{"text":"A must try when in Phoenix. So much better than Hot n Juicy spots. Cajun fries was delish & shrimp bag was awesome. Add corn in your seafood bag for extra taste. 

Careful when picking your spice level cuz even mild is spicy. As for the sauce opt for the trifecta choice which is Cajun, lemon pepper & garlic sauce."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  John was our server and he was so so polite and nice and gave great service!  This is a favorite for our family!  Delicious food!!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing!! The staff is extremely helpful as well. 
The only thing is: make sure they have what you want to eat before you go there. Went there on a week day and they were out of most crabs and appetizers. Also, the restaurant is very loud."}
{"text":"We love going to angry crab! I had to walk to the front counter and ask for salt and lime & forks and gloves, however, each employee was very pleasant and helpful. They were out of crawfish the day we went and it does happen to be out of a certain product. I hope they figure out a way to accommodate the customers who were craving for the certain seafoods. I would still recommend this place to get your seafood cravings!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here, I had the BBQ and it was decent. Prices seemed reasonable. Will return."}
{"text":"I really don't know what these folks are raving about. This place was NOT all that. Wait staff is not very professional or do a good job of selling what the idea of the place is supposed to be. If dingy and sort of rude is what they are going for, they'll never pull off a dicks last resort.  Ordered the hush puppies. They were really not good and served with ketchup and some type of mayo dipping sauce. They were small and over cooked. Not one spec of real corn or peppers, just small little corn meal balls deep fried.  Had the soft shell crab po boy. Huge mistake. Bread was over heated, lettuce or slaw whatever it was was not fresh, and the crab was ridiculously horrible. Overlooked and pathetically small size. And when I say over cooked I mean battered and fried to the point it tasted burnt and oily and kept the flavor of whatever was previously in the oil before my soft shell! I was extremely disappointed with my meal especially after all these raving posts about this place. Not sure what people see in this place."}
{"text":"I like the Mesa location ambiance and service better.  Is it possible the prices are less in Mesa also?

Sat in a booth and had snow crab.  Didn't get any crackers or scissors so had to use my hands for everything.

Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved everything... Im from the east coast and it made me feel like I was back in Maryland... Excellent service from our lovely waitress Emily.   I will be coming back allllllll the time!"}
{"text":"Update: 9/19/17
Took my brother who came in town from Alaska as well as my cousin who is new to angry crab along with my husband tonight and was not impressed with the quality of food tonight. We love angry crab and I always take my family who comes to town here for seafood but tonight we left feeling disappointed.
The main reasons for this was: the rice we ordered was extremely mushy (too much water) and the snow crab meat was non existence. The crab when we proceeded to break open was very flexible thin shell and hollowed. When I first tasted the meat it tasted old and fishy. We are originally from Alaska and we know what it taste like when crab is not fresh or freezer burnt or just not good quality, we can tell from the shell, taste and quality of the meat. We did bring it to attention to our server who proceeded to bring a manager over. The manager proceeded to crack one of the crab legs open and immediately noticed what we saw, a hollow piece of snow crab leg and adv us that sometimes the batches of snow crab doesn't fully develop and grow into the crab. She asked us if we wanted another batch and we agreed we did not want to proceed. We ordered two lbs of snow crab which was $18/lb and at our final bill there was a discount of $18 that was taken off. As I mentioned we love angry crab but felt that this crab was not good, should not have been served at all for safety reasons."}
{"text":"Best spot in Phoenix for crab legs and oysters! I'm disappointed that they have been shorting the sauce they cook crab legs in but could just be the cook at the moment. Also charred oysters are incredible but call ahead because the other day they were out and I went mainly for that. Even with those little issues I'm still giving 5 stars because it's simply the best!"}
{"text":"This a very authentic crab shack. I enjoyed the blue crab which comes in a bag. It can be an bit intimidating but worth the work. If you don't want to work order the fried cod and chips- it's a huge order. Love the atmosphere, reminds me of San Diego."}
{"text":"Love this location. Bar service can be a titch slow, but the waitstaff is very attentive and on top of things. The food never disappoints. The trifecta sauce is perfect, and I was surprised by how much I liked the sausage. Definitely try the Cajun Bloody Mary as well!!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner at Angry Crab for the first time and loved it!   Our server Noel was awesome.  He talked us through the menu and explained everything.  We went with a $20 deal that included 1/2 lb each of king crab knuckles, Dungeness crab, crawfish and vegetables.   We also ordered another bag with blue crab.  Just an FYI: this stuff is spicy!  I love spicy food and ordered a 3 and 4 and wished that I had gone with a 2 at least!  My mouth was on fire!

Noel was amazing.  Constantly checked on us. Brought everything out quickly and cleared the table as we ate.  Even brought crayons out for the kids to draw on the butcher paper table covering.  He really made our first experience at Angry Crab something to remember.   Super friendly and extremely knowledgable about the menu.  Steered us toward ordering the right things for our tastes.   

The only reason this place got 4 stars and not 5 was the value.  It's a bit expensive for what you get, but definitely delicious!

A couple of tips:

This is a meal where you will literally get your hands dirty.  Don't be shy about wearing the plastic bibs.  You will definitely need it!

The French fries are delicious and help if your mouth is on fire from the spicy food.  

Not a first date place.   No plates or utensils so you will be using your hands to eat and the entire table is your plate.  The atmosphere is fun and casual.  


Say hi to Noel if you go in. Enjoy the laid back atmosphere and be prepared for a unique experience!"}
{"text":"The waiter was amazing, and so was the food. The ambiance is really nice. Very fun and loud. VERY casual. Don't wear anything nice, you WILL smell like their sauces. The food was really great and super interactive. I don't suggest the shrimp, they're not that great. King crab still has my mouth drooling."}
{"text":"So much fun!  We went for the first time on Father's Day.  We were told it would be an hour and a half wait and they would text us when our table was ready.  I like how they take notes on what the person is wearing, etc to identify them when they come back for their tables.  Very efficient in a busy environment.  It did not take 1 1/2 hours for our table and I missed the text by about 20 minutes.  It was no big deal upon arrival and our table was ready.

The service was fast and very friendly and helpful.

There is a good choice of food at a very reasonable price.

We tried the Alaskan King Crab legs and the blue crab.  Next time will try the snow crab.  The Alaskan King Crab was good but hard to crack since it is so thick.  Made eating it not was fun.

Tried the garlic butter and it was good but a bit much by the end.  Looking forward to trying cajun next time.

I like that there are big sinks right in the restaurant to clean your messy hands with.  Also fun to take pictures with your entire group wearing a bib.

We will be back and I can't wait!!"}
{"text":"Always get the King with Kajun seasoning and #2 or 3 heat depending on the day. Have had the shrimp and Dungeness boils as well, they are all so good, have to add the potato, corn and sausage to the boil! The cornbread is great and good for dipping in your boil, great place to eat with groups as well. Get messy and clean your hands after, don't be that person that's cleaning your hands after every little bite. If you can't get your forearm cleaned off all the way to the elbow as your gf/bf to lick it off before going to the sink."}
{"text":"I've never been to Hot n Juicy so I can't really compare. I came here for the first time last night and was surprised at how busy it was at 9PM still. We put our name on the list and sat down at the bar, about 20 minutes later we were seated. So, not too bad of a wait. I was immediately surprised at how loud it was, and the music was I guess fitting for the environment but definitely not my cup of tea. Our sever Coral was sweet, we ordered a 1/2 lb of brisket with hush puppies and coleslaw, and a 1 lb bag of crab legs with three potatoes and a bag of veggies. The amount of brisket was amazing, and pretty tasty. The hush puppies were the table favorite. Then out came our bag of seafood! I got the trifecta, and a 1 level of spice. The crab legs were delicious, and the potatoes were perfectly cooked. I think the spice level was a little low for me, it still had delicious flavor but I will go to a 2 next time. 

I think what annoyed me most was the music was super loud, where I was screaming at my date and then I think every time someone does a level 5 or whatever they set off alarms which are also ridiculously loud. 

The food was good, service was pretty good (though the timing wasn't great and I got a pen that leaked ink all over me in the end) the ambiance wasn't my favorite though. I think also the benches need to be wiped down too because we were seated at a really greasy booth with hand prints all over.  I will be back because it's the central location to me, but probably during the day or something to see how it is!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  My dad and I went there for dinner tonight.  It was such a fun place!  Our waitress Autumn was so nice, she took the time and explained the menu to us since it was our first time there.  She took great care of us, we never had to wait for anything.  We both ordered a pound of the snow crab and corn and potatoes.  It was brought to us in a bag with no utensils which added to the fun!  . We both got the trifecta seasoning and he got mild I got medium.  They were perfect for us.  The medium is pretty hot, I like hot stuff so it was perfect for me.  The atmosphere is great, everyone was so nice and our food came out really fast.  I can't wait to go back!  Tip: bring a sharpie because you can write your name on the wall."}
{"text":"So delicious!  Super fun atmosphere!!  Service was EXCELLENT!!!!  Great job Angry Crab!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place, made a reservation & got seated within 10 mins on a Friday night. Service was good (by Mike) & food excellent. I ordered a Bloody Mary ($10), King Crab ($30) and 1/2 doz oysters on the half shell ($8). Call for reservations because this place get packed."}
{"text":"Great food and service. My wife and I enjoyed it very much. We will be coming back :-)"}
{"text":"Great food, but the service was outstanding! We had oysters, salmon, sweet potato fries, and gumbo. All prepared perfectly. Our server, Sarai was charming, and efficient. We will ask for her next time.

Update Deb, is far and away the best, server of all time.   The food continues to be worth the trip across the valley.  If she's not up for a raise she should be.  Ask for Deb. 

We met the manager Dave.  He knows his stuff."}
{"text":"I came here for seafood and ended up eating wings :/ I tried to order fried  oysters but they were out of oysters. I tried the snapper basket... They were out too. So I ended up with wings & a basket of cod. This is what I would say: No to the cod, unless you apply 2 full lemons and a bottle of hot sauce. No to the wings. It seems as if they make them with the same coating as the fish. No to the beans... Too sweet. Yes to the fries. They're golden goodness. In the meantime they have a board with things they don't have... I have never seen that before. And there was like an event where people were screeming and using loud machacas. My ears hurt. They tried to sit me on a table next to the bathroom, which I did not appreciate. And my server was like a shooting star... A rare sighting. This was not a good experience, so I don't care for coming back."}
{"text":"Fun Louisiana backyard seafood boil plus great fried seafood baskets. Tasty."}
{"text":"Besides sushi, I've never had crab before. I had NO idea what to expect when I walked in this place. As I took a look around I saw a bunch of people wearing bibs, licking their fingers, and slurping crab juices. I was kind of disgusted to be honest, and it was a little too late for me to back out since I was meeting a friend there.

The first thing the waitress did was cover my table in construction paper and tie a bib around me. I'm a classy lady, and this went way beyond my sensibilities. As each moment passed, I became more and more skeptical of this place and had very little interest in ordering anything. My dinner mate did not have the same feelings and ordered half the menu. Three different types of crabs, oysters, shrimp, bread, and fries. It was all delivered in plastic baggies and accompanied with a giant tin bin.

My dining mate cut my first crab leg and gave me a piece and as soon as I had my first bite of Angry Crab crab meat I was in love. It was a burst of flavor in my mouth. I didn't want to wait for someone to cut the crab meat open for me so I grabbed the crab and started tearing and ripping. I needed more crab meat. I did the same with the shrimp, and I slurped the oysters. I had sauce on my face and I was licking my fingers. 

I left feeling dirty and smelling fishy but it was THE BEST FOOD that I've had in a long time. Enjoyed the food tremendously and loved the experience."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, fun environment staff was friendly. The wait was long and our order was not correct and it was a little pricey."}
{"text":"Great place to go with fun friends and family.  Get ready to get your hands dirty while you fill your belly with some delish Cajun style sea food.  Can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"So I've never been to this \"Boiling Crab\" place that everyone wants to compare this place to - but now that I've been to Angry Crab, I sure hope the former lives up to all the hype!

I had a pound of king crab, a pound of snow crab, some hush puppies, and corn.  The crab was delicious and I highly recommend the trifecta sauce.  My crab was steaming hot when it came out, as was the corn, and both were cooked just the right amount.  The hush puppies could have had a little bit of a sweeter taste, but that's just personal preference...all in all, really tasty crab and a delicious meal.  I thought the prices were very reasonable and a good value.

The service was pretty decent, and although I had the impression some of the crew was new at their jobs (they did just open up), I was satisfied with their effort.

Lastly, seems like a great place to bring a group to share several pounds - going to round up some co-workers for my next visit!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday a Little after 10pm for first time. Service was slow waited 15 minutes just for water? Food was over salted. Felt like workers were rushing to close up early although they had a restaurant full of customers. Don't like feeling rushed not sure I'd return. Staff needs more customer service training. Food tasted like it was rushed by cooks over salted and greasy."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and have always loved the food. This time was no different as a friend and I went for lunch. Delicious!
Unfortunately by the time we got home from lunch, both of us were sick. I have Multiple Sclerosis and there must have been MSG or some chemicals in the food because I could not walk and had swollen legs the rest of the day and night. I thought maybe it wasn't the food so the next day I ate my left over crab leg and sausage and experienced the same effects. Sour stomach, indigestion, swollen limbs and felt like I had the flu.  All effects were gone within 24 hours of eating the food.
I plan to go to this location and see what they put in the food.
Sad because I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Went to the angry crab for the first time on a Saturday night. Had a little wait. (Which was not too bad for a busy Saturday night.) To start our meal we ordered a dozen oysters in a half shell, and they were delicious. I ordered the shrimp and Dungeness crab - was very pleased by both.The peeps in my party ordered king crab legs, and we all tried different sauces and all were very tasty. Of course we had a non seafood lover in the crowd, and she ordered a buffalo chicken po boy. Which was full of flavor and delicious. Eating out of a bag the food was cooked in-on a paper covered table was a little messy but fun.I will definitely be going back soon to discover some more delicious tasting seafood at the Angry Crab!"}
{"text":"So we came here for my wife's birthday. 

Sold out
. Lobster
Blue crabs 
Crawfish

WTF

Ruined meal.
12 people.

What a mis-managed franchise. 
 It should be returned to the corporation."}
{"text":"SKIP the appetizers.  IGNORE the plated food.  YOU are meant for better things!  YOU are meant for the magnificent seafood in a bag seasoned just the way you like it, just as spicy as you like it, with as many little potatoes & mini corn cobs as you want!

My personal favs after multiple test runs:
Mussels in Pacific Rim, with 2 potatoes (trust me, scoop up that sauce)
Shrimp in the trifecta, with the corn cobs (really complements the sweet corn)
Snow Crab in the Traditional Boil (doesn't overwhelm the perfect crab flavor)
NOTE:  Sauce is One Level Hotter than you would expect.  I LOVE hot food and Mild is just fine for me at this place.  Don't overwhelm the natural flavor of the seafood by kicking it up a notch!

We once went there TWICE in one day - ain't no ignoring the Crab Craving when it hits!  Don't judge til you try it for yourself!  Awesome floor plan.  Great service. Wash it down with some local beer on tap!  Rinse, Repeat!!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Period. Order your favorite seafood by the pound. Pick your sauce. Dig in!!! Fries are amazing. Mixed drinks are strong. Trifecta sauce is great. We had shrimp, clams, and snow crab. Red velvet cake was good too. I wish I could go back every week!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here about 2 weeks ago. Our server was really nice and helpful. I had a pound of shrimp with 3 potatoes and sausage. They say their spice runs hot, but it doesn't. Luckily I got a hot and was able to eat it like nothing. The shrimp are big and sausage was delicious. Also had a whiskey and ginger. The drink was a pretty good size, worth the money. Our friend had the oysters and they where decent size but tasteful. The friend shrimp was also very delicious. The order of shrimp came with \"Cajun\" style fries, best fries I've ever had I'm my life. Overall good and excellent experience.

Only bad thing was that I wanted a lemon cut in half. Instead of using a lot of little itty bitty pieces lol But I won't take off a star for that. Food, drinks and service speak for itself. Great job staff!!"}
{"text":"I love seafood and Bloody Marys I get both of those things here! The seafood here is always fresh and I feel like i'm close to the ocean whenever I eat here. Don't wear super nice clothes here because you might splatter on yourself! And its a first come first serve basis so if you get there late you might miss out on some tasty blue crab!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my husband and mother-in-law. I really enjoyed the service and my snow crab was delicious. My only real complaints were: 1) the sauce didn't really make the food spicy, just made my hands burn (next time I'll get medium on the side) 2)BBQ beans were more sour than I would like."}
{"text":"poor service, greasy food rude server, disapointing"}
{"text":"Went around 7P on a Sunday night.  The parking lot was crowded -- a good sign.  Inside it was a full house, LOTS of little kids, overhead bright cafeteria lights, dirty looking, and EXTREMELY NOISY.  I have never been to such a noisy restaurant in my life.  THEN there was some kind of siren they blew.  

We left right after they seated us.  We tried to tell the hostess why we were leaving, but she couldn't hear us...

We went to Guisseppie's Italian Restaurant a couple of doors to the east.  Very quiet and clean."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I've eaten here twice.  You definitely have to work for your food."}
{"text":"Found out about this place via Yelp and glad I did. I went went with 1 pound shrimp with the trifecta sauce, level 1 on the heat. I thought it was absolutely delicious. It was the prefect blend of spices with a good amount of garlic. Plan on getting  messy when you eat here because there is no silverware. Put your bib on and dig in with your hands. Luckily they have a sink right out on the floor to clean up with after. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Went today for a late dinner (around 9) and had an AMAZING Time. 
Food was great, ordered a pound of clams and mussels and two pounds of crab. I love that they have different sauces! Theres a loooot of oil used in the food, but still pretty good.
My drink was never empty, and service was one of the best I've had. 
My boyfriend and I were approached by three different servers, making sure things were good!
Love love love it, definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"Not a meal, but an experience. Great family time, great food, great service.  We ordered a variety of items to include shrimp, crawfish, calamari, frog legs and alligator. Was able to specify flavors and heat temperature."}
{"text":"Can I give it less than 3-Star??
A dude at work brought me here so at least I didn't pay but BLEH!! I'm pretty sure he was into me, like romantically but no sir, I got a girl I be digging, yo. So..."}
{"text":"I love angry crab! But I have to agree with one of the precious reviewers that this may not be the best location. This is my 3rd location I've been to but I found here the seafood wasn't quite as good. Maybe I caught them on an off day? 
Food and concept is still great enough with good service, but I might drive on through to a different location next time."}
{"text":"This is another once of those circumstances wherein the hype did not live up to the execution.

I have now been to every Angry Crab Shack in the valley from the far west valley to the far east valley, and can emphatically state that I still do not think that their product is all that impressive, or flavorful.

Just consolidating several items into a pot, barely letting the flavor seep in, and then presenting them in a plastic bag may hold some novelty at the onset, but doesn't deliver on its flavorful promise.

I had the shrimp and crab lemon flavored concoction, with corn. And just like Christmas morning, I was hoping that this time; I would get the gift that I really wanted and was expecting. Not so!

The corn was great, but the shrimp and the crab just tasted like boiled meat with a dash of lemon. That's it. Not very imaginative, nor flavorsome. 

My wife had the Fried Shrimp basket, and she indicated that it was pretty standard fare. However, she did enjoy the potato salad.

However, our server was very nice and friendly. The atmosphere was quite festive, to make the passing of time bearable. But, that was about the extent of our enjoyment of this particular experience."}
{"text":"The seafood spot on.

Surprisingly the chicken wings are delicious now I go back just for the wings. If anyone is interested, Try the Cajun style with #4 sauce."}
{"text":"We had a group of 11 and the waitress would stand at the end of the table to get drink orders and such so a couple things got messed up. Otherwise, this a fun place to come with a group, your family, or just a couple people. It can get messy so ditch your white shirt for the night!  I suggest the onion rings, shrimp + trifecta + level 1-3 spice, sausage, corn, red potatoes. Yum!"}
{"text":"So excited to finally be reviewing this place! After a lot of recommendations from friends and amazing reviews on Yelp, my brother and I decided to step outside of our usual seafood comfort zone and try some New Orleans style crab, shrimps and mussels. We definitely weren't disappointed! The food was delicious and it paired well with the awesome customer service we had from Dawn! (She's amazing, if you can ask for her table!) We were recommended the Trifecta sauce #2 hot level (we probably could of handled level 3, but wanted to keep it safe) Ordered the Snow Crabs, Shrimps and Mussels - all so delicious and spicy! Ended up ordering another bag of Crabs and Shrimps to go for our parents  -- Word of caution: Did ended up getting sick afterwards that night and next day... I don't know if this happened to others that night 2/16/16"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight and we were both surprised and very happy that we finally came in. The staff from the hostesses to bartenders and our waitress, Shelby, were knowledgeable and friendly. It's a pretty noisy place, but a great place to go with friends and now that we know we'll be sure to bring some with us next time.

We order shrimp in a bag with sausage and corn on the cob and brisket and pulled pork two meat dinner and all of it was delicious plus we have enough bbq for another meal and everything was very reasonably priced.

We'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We back last Wednesday and had another terrific night at the Angry Crab!  This time we ordered the mussel boil and fried clams.  The waiter brought us the wrong mussels, so the boss gave us the bag we ordered as well -- nice folks!  We weren't worried about the mixup, but it was awful nice of them to give us BOTH pounds of mussels!"}
{"text":"There are few places you can go and enjoy amazing seafood. Angry Crab is the place! Great for groups or on a fun date. The vibe is cool and the service is friendly. The trifecta king crab legs are ridiculously good. They melt in your mouth. My husband won't stop raving about it,  and we have to bring all of our out of town guests to our hidden gem. You won't find another spot like it. If you haven't tried it yet,  you're missing out."}
{"text":"Food:  Extremely good.  We got a pound of the crawfish with Trifectca 4 sauce and a pound of the shrimp with Pacific Rim 3 sauce.  Both very good, but 4 was approaching my limits for heat (can go up to 5), and I can take extremely hot food.  WE added potatoes and sausage to both boils.  Sausage was fantastic with the trifecta and a bit weird with the pacific rim sauce.  Potatoes could have been cooked a bit longer.  We also ordered the gumbo and Cajun fries.  The Cajun fries are HUGE and quite well seasoned.  The gumbo was quite bland to start with, but we added some of the trifecta sauce to it and WOW, it really kicked it off and the gumbo was nothing short of awesome with that bit of kick added to it.  The only thing I didn't like was that you couldn't get a sample of any of the sauces to gauge heat level without paying extra for it.

Ambiance:  Extremely casual.  The walls have been intentionally gafitti'ed, concrete floor, basic tables and booths.  

Tip #1:  Come prepared to get very messy... no utensils, a plastic bib and digging into a plastic bag to get your food is the order of the day!  :-)  (They don't do a good job of making that clear on their website.)

Tip #2:  Come for late lunch.  Restaurant can seat about 100 or so but from what we heard can get pretty packed for dinner on any night and lunch is brisk.

Tip #3:  If you order the gumbo, add one of the spices they use for their boil to it.

Service:  All of the employees were extremely friendly and attentive, but the restaurant was pretty empty when we were there, so I don't know what service is like when it is full.

Prices:  Acceptable for seafood, about $20/person should do if you don't get drinks.

Net:  If you love good seafood and good Cajun/Creole, you really need to give this place a shot.  I was right on the fence between 4 and 5 stars...  If they allowed one or two free samples of the sauces and the gumbo was better without the personalization I'd give the nod for a full 5."}
{"text":"The food not bad-really! But for the price-O MY!!! I can understand that Arizona not near any ocean so seafood can be expensive, but how about corn and potatoes??  I only got one (half) of corn in a bag and it cost me 75 cents/half corn. Really? I love seafood but with the money that I pay here - it's just not worth it.  Only going come here when I really super crave for seafood."}
{"text":"Everyone we spoke with was so friendly and pleasant  to include Diana one of the managers. ..and our server Emily who was training Tray was great!  Also, Brandon....just everyone. ..a great family place and delicious seafood!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite go to restaurants for really good seafood. We absolutely love this place. For a Friday night at 8:00, our wait was only 15 minutes. Not bad at all. For the first time, the menu is a little confusing but once the server explained it, it was on. We started with the charred oysters. They were cooked nicely,  great texture & full of flavor. We will definitely have them again. For the entrée, we ordered a pound of shrimp, a pound of mussels, a pound of snow crab legs with corn, potatoes and sausage. I didn't like that the corn, sausage & potatoes cost extra but you must do it. The sauce we chose was the trifecta medium. Before you judge, the medium is no joke. Medium my ass! It starts out mild, but because you eat so much, the burn quickly intensifies. The food was cooked to perfection and was more than enough for the two of us. It was so much, we had left overs for the next day. I rinsed off the sausage, cut it up smaller & scrambled it in eggs for breakfast. For drinks, appetizers & entrées, we got out of there for around $77 including tip. Not too bad. 
I recommend the angry crab for just you & your mate but its really good for large gatherings. Its a fun atmosphere, with awesome seafood food & plenty of laughs. We're going again tomorrow night!"}
{"text":"went her for the first time waited a little while but I saw plenty of seat open .besides that I had a pound of shrimp and had there three meat platter ribs brisket and pulled pork the shrimp was decent not bad the brisket was so good and tender that was my favorite ribs was ok wouldn't order them again very dry and pulled pork was decent also service was ok could have been better overall this place was good must try if you never been."}
{"text":"Lip smackin', finger lickin good! One thing. They don't split pounds. Go with someone if you want a taste of more than just one pound. Service is great. Family friendly. Expect to wait. Here on Friday night and everyone waited...not too long, but they waited. Beer is cold!  Buen provecho!"}
{"text":"We will be back. It was very good.  I wasn't happy that they were out of crawfish.  I was told that they ran out at lunch.  Supposedly, we were told, they aren't used to being open for lunch and ran out.  A friend of mine has been there twice and neither time did they have crawfish. I want to try other things.  I had the dungeoness crab.  One crab came to $32.00.  a little pricey
The restaurant was clean from what we could see.  The ladies' room really, really needed attention.  It needs a good scrubbing. everywhere"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, staff and food! My new favorite place to get my seafood on!"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying the fresh oysters were the best I have ever had(and I have had a lot). They weren't gritty or muddy tasting. Just a simple clean oyster.

I got 1lb of shrimp and 1 lb of snow crab legs. Both were so tender and juicy. I believe I had a sweet and tangy sauce. It wasn't my favorite for seafood but very good none the less. My husband had 1lb of clams and 1 lb of crawfish. He really enjoyed his as well. There was just a ton of flavor in all the dishes we got.
The kids menu was a bit sad BUT the had chicken tenders and fries so my little boys were happy with what they had.
The atmosphere is a great family place that I didn't have to worry about my little one getting restless.

My only complaint was the pricing. And I don't mean it was over priced but you HAVE to buy it by the Lb. I would have preferred to get a 1/2 lb each and gotten more if desired."}
{"text":"I have t been back yet, but it's so encouraging when a manger believes so much in his restaurant  that he suggested I come back And try again on the house! I give them an A for effort!! Good job!"}
{"text":"best place. the service was great and the waiter was awesome. defiantly  will come back. we had come to this place after finding that a member of our group was goong thru a divorce an the waiter was fun and really cool she offer to show us how to eat our crab since it was our first time there. we loved the hot sauce for the shrimp."}
{"text":"Tried this place out because I had a taste for crawfish/shrimp boil and wanted to try a different place other that hot & juicy in tempe.  We ordered about 2lbs of shrimp with potatoes and corn in garlic sauce. We got our food and as I began eating the shrimp something didn't taste right. I looked at the shrimp and noticed is was covered in blacks spots and portions of it were raw. I looked at the others in the bag and they too all had black spots and were clearly spoiled as I have tasted raw shrimp before and this clearly was old and should have never been served to anyone. I just about vomited and asked for a manger that was apologetic, though the next day I was quite ill. They didn't charge us for the food but can't see how anyone could serve spoiled food especially when seafood is your main business. Avoid unless food poisoning is on your to do list."}
{"text":"Great food, fun restaurant, friendly staff. Shrimp boil was amazing. Can't wait until they open their Ahwatukee location!"}
{"text":"Terrible food, however staff was very friendly and accommodating. Catfish made me loose my appetite."}
{"text":"Tried this place after hearing several raving reviews but found it not to be as we expected. Think of it as an even more casual version of Joe's Crab Shack but still equally as expensive for really not much food. We left still feeling hungry and were rather disappointed. I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Last week, I was trying to come up with a great new place to try for dinner with friends... The Southerner in me could not have been more thrilled to find the Angry Crab Shack off of Camelback!!

The place looks unassuming and chain'ish from the outside, tucked away in a strip mall... but after reading the reviews here, we were ready to give it a try. There is plenty of parking, and we were there around 6PM on a Thursday, which meant no waiting for a table. The family-friendly atmosphere was apparent, as we watched kids and adults alike drawing on the walls and their tables.

As soon as I saw the menu, I knew that alligator nuggets were happening! I've had them a few times before, and these were great! The flavor is a lot like chicken, while the consistency is slightly chewier (like shrimp). This is a great place to try it if you've never had gator before!

One thing I've really missed from home is having a good, cajun seafood boil, and WOW did this place deliver!!! We ordered the veggies, mussels, snow crab and shrimp, with the trifecta flavoring and a spice level of \"2\" on a 0-5 scale. I'm a spice-lover, and this was just right for me! The crab legs were a hands-down stand out, and the mussels weren't far behind! We loved the shrimp and veggies too, but agreed that next time, we'd probably forego them for more of our favorites! The consumption process is (as with all good boils!) a little messy, so we just poured it out on the table and went to town! (Maybe don't dump all of the sauce, but the rest is fine on the butcher paper.) We stuffed ourselves, enjoying every bite!! It was well-complimented by my Abita purple haze, which I was happy to find on draft. The butcher paper and sink on the side of the room made for an easy post-meal clean up, so that in no time, we were sitting at a nice, tidy table again.

We'll definitely be back soon, and next time, I'll add some red potatoes to the bag! Yum!!"}
{"text":"What a great place!! Not easy to find - our gps kept taking us to the next street over. Its in the far corner, opposite end of the strip mall, from Frys grocery. 
Great crab \"bag\" and ribs were so tender. Eat everything with your hands, a bit messy but mmmmm, mmmm good!!"}
{"text":"My favorite seafood place hands down! I know I'm going here to get my hands dirty and stuff my face with buttery, Cajun goodness. The king crab is a MUST! I add corn, potato, and sausage to my bag and that's it, I'm happy as a clam. There is a handwashing station in the middle the restaurant, because it is inevitable that you will make a mess like a toddler when you eat here. If you're squeamish or going out on a first date, this place may not be for you. But if you love seafood, beer, and Cajun flavors bursting in your mouth and awakening your taste buds, then put on your stretchy fat pants and get some! My mouth is watering just thinking about this place."}
{"text":"First time awesome

Second  time my meal came half frozen after a very long waitby the time we got the servers attention my family was finished with their meals so the offer to have it re cooked seemed a little off so every one could sit there for another 30 minutes, then watch me eat....uuumm no thanks"}
{"text":"We've been driving by this place for months waiting for it to open. Today we went in for \"lunch\". I had the King Crab and my wife had the Lobster. Both were outstanding, but expensive. Everything comes in a plastic bag and you eat it with your fingers on the table. Very messy. I had a rock to break my crab legs as did my wife for her lobster. I've never had a meal where I made so much of a mess eating it. It was fun, but don't wear clothes you care about getting splattered with sauce and butter. I had the mild seasoning and it was very mild. The next time I will go for the med sauce.
Our server was named Susie and she was a hoot. Very friendly and helpful with making choices and bringing you anthing you needed. 
You won't leave hungry or clean. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been to Angry Crab Shack with my husband for dinner twice in a short period of time. Their service in both times was flawless. We ordered what we have made our usual at similar restaurants, shrimps usually with a tri/3 combination sauce, corn, a fish basket that usually comes with fries and drinks. Every once in a while, we may order an appetizer which is usually fried calamari. 

Ordering was easy. We were asked if it was our first time and on our first time, our waitress explained the menu to us. The food came out very quickly, we were impressed with the speed. 

The food tasted very good. I would have loved to give this place 5 stars but honestly, having tried a similar restaurant in the valley about 4-5 times, I still think they remain my favorite. What is different? It's the sauce and flavor. The first time, our food had way too much butter for my liking. The shrimps did not absorb the flavor enough so they felt bland. The second time I asked for less butter. The shrimps came out dryer yes but then again, they were bland even though I chose medium for my heat level. I think it would be great if they would consider increasing the garlic especially in their tri-fecta sauce. It has the potential to be superb, it's just more on the bland side if you ask me. Also, I think the food can use some more salt. One thing about sea food in general, if you don't salt it well, it loses its flavor. 

I still would say the place deserves my 4 stars and I would not at all discourage any one from going there but I have already established my favorite restaurant early on I guess."}
{"text":"Nothing to complain about.  My oysters were raw, huge and delivered on time.  My beer was kiltlifter - nuff said.  My entree was know my crab.  Massive and delicious!   Service at this bar?  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Heard about this off yelp and figured I would give it a try. 

Went in with our family of 7. Crammed in a small booth/table. 

All of us ordered or own thing and can honestly say none of us liked it at all. 

Greasy and over flavored. Place was busy so I am sure other people sure get a kick out of it but not us."}
{"text":"Service is horrible. Last time I came I used my debit card and it wouldn't clear their system. I had plenty of money to pay for our meal and couldn't. Manager never came over once to help of offer assistance and I ended up having to walk to Walmart near by use their ATM and finally got the money to pay. Second time here as a guest and sat for over 10 min before I had to ask if anyone was going to help my family and I. Food is ok... service is horrible. The Phoenix locations are better. Maybe this location can step it up."}
{"text":"Man, I have been wanting to try a \"Hot & Juicy\", \"Boiling Crab\", or now \"Angry Crab\" -style place for years. 

My mom actually suggested this place & my brother had been here a few times already. I was sold when I got on Yelp! & saw what it was.

First off, it was Saturday night around 8:00pm. It was packed. You could see pulling up. What do you expect of a good restaurant tho? We walked in, put our name in & they said a one hour wait. We didn't exactly wait that long, but... We did wait. 

I never thought I would see the day that my parents were wearing bibs, eating out of plastic bags tossed on the table, or my mom grabbing french fries & tossing them on the table in front of me... Oh, & no flatware! We got the lobster, head off shrimp, mussels, king crab legs, raw oysters, charred oysters, fried calamari, corn, potatoes, rice, & my brother w| a buffalo chicken sandwich. The different flavors that I ordered were; trifecta, garlic & lemon pepper. All at a heat of 2. I definitely felt the heat. I loved the garlic flavor the most, but they say trifecta is the most popular. I wasn't sure how the potatoes came, so I ordered 2. Heads up, they are two tiny potatoes. I thought it would be two potatoes cut up. It wasn't a big deal tho. The food was fabulous. The service was incredible & the price was more than reasonable. I couldn't believe it w| I saw the bill. Under $200 for everything. It is messy, but I feel like people should understand that when they come in

Also, all the seafood comes in tact. If you order lobster, you will get the whole lobster & a rock to smash it apart. Unless you wanna be like me & ask the waiters to do everything for you. :-) LOL! 

I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance! We love coming here with friends and haven't been disappointed. Good beer selection and great brisket BBQ for the non seafood eaters like myself. I can't get enough brisket!"}
{"text":"A must go for crab, and a must go back for the rest of my life! Great specials around holidays. We were there around Mother's Day and got a great big boil with a little of everything to share for a good price."}
{"text":"The crabs are angry because the food is pretty bland. I ordered the rib platter. The flavor was not smoky at all. The beans were okay. I visited after reading positive reviews, but I was sorely let down."}
{"text":"Ended up here after finding Heltons packed on their one year anniversary. The place was hopping on a Saturday night around 7:00. It's rather rowdy. A lot going on and a lot of noise. They have plenty of space and a lot of tvs. We found a spot at the bar. Decent craft draft beer selection on tap at $5 a pint. We split the fried catfish basket. It was really good, and was plenty for the both of us with Cajun fries and another side of your choice. Price was right too at $9. This is not a place to have a quiet conversation, but if you don't mind the commotion, it's a great place to get a beer and something good to eat at a good price. We will be back to try the barbeque."}
{"text":"Really like the peel and eat shrim here, haven't got around to trying the BBQ because the seafood is so good. Can get a little pricey if you venture into the more exotic shellfish (crab and lobster) but stick with shrimp and you'll have a very inexpensive and delicious meal"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong... the food is excellent!  But the atmosphere!? It was horrible!  The music was ridiculously way too freaking loud!! Everyone was yelling over the music the entire time to be heard just across their own table!!! Me husband and I asked  to have it turned down and relocated to the very back of the restaurant but that didn't help much at all because there are speakers throughout the restaurant.  Plain and simple... the music was just unnecessarily way too loud! Couldn't carry on a conversation without screaming at each other! Just horrible!"}
{"text":"Oh Angry Crab Shack, God bless you!!! I will be brutally honest and say that I was not a huge fan of the Mesa location for plenty of reasons (LOCATION, inconsistent taste/spice levels of the sauces, price) however we kept coming back to get our seafood boil fix because of the lack of this type of restaurant here. It slowly grew on us as the recipe kept improving. And by the time THIS location opened, it has been perfected! Yay! My family came in on day 2 of the opening and was pleasantly surprised to be seated within 5 minutes. Hallelujah! I celebrated my new job here and there was no better place I would have rather been. Our server was a total sweetheart. So attentive and charismatic as are almost all the servers we get when we come in. We don't come in without several pounds of shrimp in Trifecta sauce (mild or medium). The shrimp are sizable compared to their competition. The clams are always good as well but sometimes we can skip it if we don't want to go too crazy... because of course we HAVE to get the BBQ... Oh my goodness... Their brisket is SUPERB. ACQ sauce mild is the way to go. I think now their BBQ dishes comes with 2 choices of meat and we have tried their ribs but I highly recommend sticking with double brisket. BBQ also comes with 2 sides but we ALWAYS opt to substitute for cajun fries. Oh those fries... careful because you won't be able to stop eating them. We've had to get additional orders of those fries on more than 1 occasion. We have come here on weekends and weekdays on all sorts of different hours of the day but NEVER had to wait more than 5 minutes on a table. The place is huge, much bigger than the Mesa location. I love this restaurant!!! Thank you for being in my life, Angry Crab Shack! Arizona needed this."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was lacking. 

Food:
Trifecta was good. Well balanced flavors. I have been to the infamous Boiling Crab plenty of times and I'll have to say Trifecta beats the Whole Shebang. We had it with shrimp. The shrimps were large and not overcooked. We also got a lobster in lemon pepper sauce. Tasty also but I'd prefer with Trifecta the next time around. We originally ordered clams in lemon pepper sauce but was later informed they were out so we changed it to a lobster. The Cajun fries were tasty. Nice hearty basket. Also got a dozen oysters and they were also good.

Service:
Very lacking. Took a while for our server to take our order. We probably waited about 10-15 minutes for her to come take our order. As I mentioned above, they ran out of clams but did not tell us until they brought out the shrimp portion of our order. Wish we were notified right after we placed our order. We finished our shrimps and was waiting a while before our lobster came. Also didn't help that our Cajun fries we ordered haven't came out either at this time. I had to ask the waitress about this and she said she would go check. She came back and said \"They are making it right now. It was on the ticket but I guess they didn't see it\". Really? No apologies either. 

There are no utensils given at the table. We had to ask for a spoon for the cup of cocktail sauce that came with our oysters. Were we suppose to pour it? We added potatoes to our shrimps and they were whole red potatoes cut in half, so they were pretty large chunks and we had to use out fingers to break it up in pieces and eat it. My friends hubby ordered crabs and had to ask for crackers -_- C'mon, that should've been caught on their end. It also took her quite a while to bring us our check. It felt like we kept having to ask for things... 

I'll probably be back because it's the only place here right now to get this type of food. I hope the service/training gets better and they really work on improving the communication between the dining room & kitchen staff. 

I'll update my review on my next visit if my perception changes."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The seafood always tastes fresh and the sauces are awesome! We love the Pacific Rim spice level 3 (hot). We usually get the snow crab but this time we tried the blue crab and although I think it tastes better than the snow crab, it's more work and not as meaty. We had the hush puppies and added potatoes and corn to the boils. Delish!!!"}
{"text":"Great food!! Didn't get any service from wait staff after being served. Confronted management and they he very argumentative. The manager on duty is a huge dick!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time coming here, my bff invite me. So I decided to give it a try. The food was so good no question about it. We order one order of the shrimp with sausage and fried calamari, we finished the shrimp so we order 1 more but at the moment my friend had on episode of epilepsy and the waiter was so nice to help me out to he handle the situation very good. The one thing that upset me is that they was still a lot of shrimp left from last order and they don't put it in the box to go. I totally forgot about it but it will be nice if hey had put them in a to go box. But everything else was good"}
{"text":"I would like to say as a Louisiana native who lives in Arizona...The Angry Crab Shack is a disgrace to the LA/Creole Culture. We had the absolute WORST service I could have imagined. Our servers name was Brittany, Beware, she could give a care about a customer. She first off, called the gumbo soup! The gumbo was terrible, i could count the amount of rice on one hand...pitiful. I will say the shrimp were excellent and very well seasoned but the sausage was cold and the corn was overcooked, along with the potatoes being undercooked. We asked 4 separate times for glasses of water and lemons, he excuse was she forgot, Ohh I forgot. She messed our ticket up as we were ready to leave... I will for sure think twice before going back to this place!!"}
{"text":"Ate here while in town for work. Need to take some stars off for the service, while it was friendly, it took a long time to be asked what I waned to drink, and then eat. They didn't seem really busy either. Ordered a buffalo chicken po boy with garlic hot sauce and it was really really good. Definitely had some kick to it. Fries were pretty good and a side of mac n cheese that I ordered was pretty solid too. Food was great, service could be improved."}
{"text":"So great!  We (my wife and I) ordered the crawfish, shrimp, lobster, king crab, side of catfish, a cup of gumbo, some sausages, and 2 corn on the cobs.  I know I loved the service because my soda was always filled, there was an endless amount of napkins in the table side dispenser, and everything was so tasty smothered in their trifecta sauce.  Could the crawfish have been a tad bigger...sure.  I really didn't care tho because they were delicious.  One tip, if you order the King Crab, request that they don't give you a claw.  Those suck to open with the scissors and rock they give you."}
{"text":"So good, I wish I could afford to eat here multiple times a week. I'm not saying it's super pricey but eating out adds up, you know. Nice that you get different options to include in your boil bag and can decide your spice level."}
{"text":"Every time I eat here, I love it more. The wait to get a table at times is made up for the quickness of the kitchen. We even had a manager hunt down napkins for us when we didn't have one on our table. Love this location!  I love the trifecta sauce and the food is always amazing!  I would give more stars if possible."}
{"text":"Angry Crab Shack just can't let me down. I've been to two others, and the quality is consistent throughout all of them. It's a messy meal, definitely unworthy of a first date, but more for those more comfortable eating with their hands around their date. That trifecta sauce is amazing!  I'm not gunna lie though - the Mesa location seems to be \"hotter\" than the others, so maybe dial down the hot factor a notch to keep your tastebuds happy. Our server made this suggestion, and I definitely don't regret following her suggestion. Try it - if you love a seafood boil, this place will be your jam!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch after seeing the line on Saturday night. Such a great place! Customize your crab boil with potatoes, sausage and/or corn, with flavors and spiciness levels all your own. Down home kind of atmosphere with butcher paper on the tables to get down and dirty.

Service is great, hush puppies were some of the best ever. And of course the crab was the business. Skip the corn and potato salad and come early."}
{"text":"Both the mesa location and south Phoenix locations have become family favorites. Food is pretty consistent, atmosphere is always a good time. Great beer and app selection. Couldn't ask for a better spot to enjoy some family time and good food."}
{"text":"I love this place. My first visit was worth every star. Our waiter (j.k. Was his name) was the perfect level of excitement and knowledge to make our first visit an event and not only dinner. We had crab and a catfish dinner. ( we also had a side of vegetables that were a level 3 medium heat but they were not edible. Too hot and I like hot) They forgot to bring one order of crab and took the veggies off the order because I couldn't eat them.  The food and customer service won me over on what could of been a terrible experience. The wait was 40 minutes but actual wait was 10 so don't go too far."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices and they don't skimp on the seasoning.  You think you like it hot?  They'll warn you that they run hotter than similar restaurants and they are not kidding!"}
{"text":"Visited on a business trip to Scottsdale with my co-workers and enjoyed the meal. I had been to Boiling Crab in California and it compares well. The 6 of us ordered pounds of shrimp, lobster, King Crab, sausages, corn and fries. All was very delicious and with the trifecta sauce. The only thing that was okay was our batch of oysters which didn't have as much flavor/saltiness but they were ginormous so if you like meaty oysters then you'll enjoy it a bit more. It's a fun messy meal and luckily they provided gloves and bibs. And tons of TVs around for your viewing pleasure. So it's a very loud and festive place and we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"we stopped in for lunch on Saturday afternoon. There was a decent lunch crowd and really cool, diverse mix of people. friendly host and servers. we had calamari strips. very tasty, I believe they used panko breading which was different. for entree, we both got the soft-shell crab basket. I really like soft-shell crab so finding this place on Yelp was great because now I now whenever I am craving where to go. Easily one of best fried soft-shell crab I have had. Their batter and seasoning were amaze-balls. You get two nice size fried soft-shell crabs in basket full of cajun fries and a side ... there were 3 options, I think cole slaw, bbq beans or potato salad. I had bbq beans. I mean for me it was all about the crab anyway. The fries were really good too. It was like $40 before tip for 2 soft drinks, appetizer and the 2 orders of soft-shell crab basket. I think that's not bad. We definitely are going to get back and try dinner because they had great list of seafood that I want to try that basically requires peeling, cracking, etc at the table. If you are craving seafood in the desert, you've found your place. Oh, and they have BBQ too!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! Fun atmosphere and great food! I saved up my salt in take for this meal since it is seafood. Their trifecta sauce is too die for! Really appreciate that the heat level is up to the customer to decide because I'm a wimp. 

My sister didn't get a boil, she got fried shrimp and ate them all. I tried their Cajun fries and LOVED them. Their gumbo was really good but a little too spicy for me. 

I told my other sister and my dad about this place and they can't wait to try it. Can't wait to have it again!"}
{"text":"Food was good but great. Service was excellent. I stood avoid the lobster and Crawfish. Lobster is way expensive and Crawfish had so little meat. The king crab is a great option. Lots of may and less expensive than lobster. Tastes great also. The treats sauce is good. Overall filing but nothing stood out. Don't be back."}
{"text":"This place makes great margaritas! 
The food is a close second to the boiling crab, but I think it is healthier. The fries are great and some of the shrimp are the size of prawns. Great place to go to but I didn't like that there was a dog allowed inside and it took a dump on the floor. So not cool! The lousy owners of the dog stepped in it and did a quick wipe so employees wouldn't see."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, first time. Ordered shrimp and crab. Shrimp comes unpeeled which should be disclosed as we told them it was our first time.  Pain in the butt to peel and devein. Crab was ok. Very very expensive for lunch, $40 for 2 people. Not my idea of a great meal and way overpriced. Staff was nice."}
{"text":"If you like Joe's Crab Shack ... then maybe this is your funky Medina.

Noisy cramped environment with Chinese quality seafood served in a plastic bag that you open and eat directly off the table with your fingers. 

Ya... Hoo!

Its just not my ... bag!"}
{"text":"I chose this place for Mother's Day and they were slammin' yet they rocked it! Our server Nick was great. He helped us figure out the menu and food was fast and delicious. Talk about a great first impression! We will absolutely be back!  I'm surprised by the few bad reviews for this place. It's a crab shack. They don't need fancy dinner wear. You're supposed to get in there and get messy and have fun! If you want pretentious overpriced seafood, go somewhere fancy. Don't complain about how they do things when it's your choice to go there! It's very reasonably priced and super fun! Great job Angry Crab! Thanks for a great Mother's Day meal!"}
{"text":"We drove all the way from PV to try this place. Totally worth it. 

We met some friends there and ordered a few beers. They were nice enough to change the TV near our table to the UFC fight. 

The waiter made a bunch of recommendations and we tried most of them- oysters, clam strips, corn bread, cajun shrimp and crawfish.

And of course, because my wife is French, we got frog legs.

Everything was seasoned perfectly. The food was delicious and the beer was cold. 

The atmosphere was a blast. People were having fun, making a mess, wearing bibs and enjoying the meal.

The price was very fair.

For a night out that's a something different and more fun than your average dinner, I highly recommend it. We will be back."}
{"text":"Love the micheladas here! Love the crab legs of course but also like the grilled salmon on rice! Service is always great here so I dont mind that they charge gratuity. Fun friendly casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Tried this place out and I am so mad I waited so long! It was awesome! We started with a lb of shrimp with the trifecta seasoning... Delish! We ended up getting a lb of snow crab after and it was super yummy, but the shrimp are the way to go. Cornbread was perfect for dipping in the drippings! It's a messy meal, but that's part of the fun. Also, Melissa, our server, was awesome.. Super helpful and friendly!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent.  Food was hit and miss.
I ordered oysters on half shelf, very good! But my deep fried oysters were not from fresh oysters.  I tried all 6 of them (a little bite on each), they were all stale and fishy.  So, I left them on the table.  I didn't get charged for the fried oysters.  That is very nice of them.
I would come back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Bomb food reminds me of back home in San Jose! So bring your appetite for good food."}
{"text":"Love those seafood, even the crocodile meat, frog logs...sounds crazy but yummy! My husband, daughter and me we had great fun there!"}
{"text":"We just discovered this location. The Cajun catfish was awesome. Frog legs were tasty. Nice atmosphere. Great service.   Price was.  $$ good. A winner. I say try it."}
{"text":"LOVE angry crab. Especially this location. My only wish is that someone would open one in Gilbert already so I could make my monthly trip a weekly one. The freshest seafood and best flavors. Snow crab is always my go to. Love the vibe, totally reminds me of being in NOLA!"}
{"text":"Average compared to similar establishments I've been to.  Hit's the spot if you want seafood but the snow crabs were not fresh as you can tell by the firmness of the meat.  It flaked and broke apart easily."}
{"text":"This is the BEST seafood restaurant I Have EVER had the pleasure of eating at!! Great service and prices aren't too bad either!!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! This is my go to spot when I want seafood. There is always a bit of a wait but if you go a little later than normal dinner time its not bad at all. The service is always prompt and the food is always amazing!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Great service. The only thing I didn't like.. your food comes in a bag and they don't give you a plate. Seriously? I do not want to eat off of the table. :( 

Been back twice since initial review. Order the king crab, it's delicious. I changed my review to 5 stars because the staff is awesome. The owner really cares about his business and it shows. Besides, my only complaint is eating off of the table... Which I have not been required to do. The staff was kind enough to provide me with a basket each time."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, I really did, but it just didn't work out this way.  The service was okay, save for a major blunder, and the food was bland. 

 My wife and I visited with our 2 kids, and were promptly seated. I was feeling adventuresome so I ordered a pound of craw-fish and my wife ordered a pound of shrimp.  We got them cooked in the trifecta sauce with a heat level of 2. 

The waitress asked if I knew how to eat craw-fish, and if I didn't she could show me. It had been a long time since I have eaten craw-fish, so I asked her for a demonstration. It turns out she really didn't know how, but it cost me 3 of my craw-fish before she pretty much gave up. The sauce was bland, and easily forgotten. 

But perhaps the worst thing of the night came when the waitress asked if I wanted a refill, she picked the cup up from the top with her hand in the cup. Clearly this is not how your supposed to pick up a cup. Needless to say, this did not make me happy.

Maybe at the end of the day, this place just isn't for me, but from my perspective at least this visit warranted the low score."}
{"text":"I went here Saturday Oct 8th for the 1st time, based on reviews though I'd check it out for a late lunch.
from the moment I walked in I wasn't impressed, although it did smell like a good seafood place.
the crab po boy was dry and seemed over cooked, the bread was huge and the meat was a little so basically your eating a cole slaw sandwich.
I don't want you to think it was all bad, I may come back with a group when  we can get messy and eat the crab out of the bags with all the fixings, but I certainly wouldn't rush back here."}
{"text":"The salmon was on point and the shrimp po boy is to die for. Really cool atmosphere super yummy food I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Well, now that i reside in Arizona I had to give up my fav fries xxx at the Boiling Crab but discovering the Angry Crab helped bring a bit of southern Cali flavor to my new residence.  I have only had the Cajun fries extra spicy on request but they were good.  The portion was large, the service quick and the waitress friendly."}
{"text":"This is the first time I write a review on Yelp. I would say that I highly recommend this restaurant. My wife and I went to Arizona for vacation last week. We went to Angry Crab Shack for our first dinner in Phoenix. We promised to each other that when we came back from Grand Canyon we would go there twice, and we did! I am a guy who get used to spicy food, but I could hardly afford the hot level here. Medium level is okay for both of us, and we think the level allows you to taste the real flavor of the seafood.

We ordered seafood only. I think it is enough to experience this restaurant. I am still looking for a restaurant like Angry Crab Shack even when I come back to Chicago!"}
{"text":"I'm a Floridian, so I'm a seafood lover at heart. The Angry Crab was somewhat of a let-down for this particular menu item.

I had the fried shrimp basket with a side of sausage and fries, and Trifecta sauce for dipping. The Trifecta sauce is a mixture of Cajun, lemon-pepper, and garlic sauce. 

The best thing on the plate was the fries, which were well seasoned, and plentiful. The Trifecta sauce had a really good flavor as well, I could see how it would be a nice accompaniment to snow crab legs, I'll have to try that next time - I will be back, just not for this horrid shrimp basket.

The shrimp was an utter disappointment. I expected a joint like this to serve real, whole shrimp, dusted in Cajun spices, with an authentic flavor. Instead I got breaded, butterflied shrimp with zero flavor, it really tasted like they used the frozen Gordon's brand of shrimp from the freezer food section of the grocery store.

The sausage was plain, and just okay... I don't know how a restaurant can claim to be Cajun or Creola and not serve authentic andouille sausage, but somehow the Angry Crab thinks this is okay.

Needless to say, I was disappointed by my meal this time around, I have been here years ago and tasted the fried soft-shell crab sandwich, and it was actually pretty good. However, this shrimp basket of theirs is a dud though, don't do it.  Also, Baby Kay's is a better representation of Cajun/Creole style food here in the metro Phoenix area."}
{"text":"First. Because not 5 stars. Don't like plastic silverware and Shrimp had head on it. I had to peel before wife would eat them. (Stupid yeah). Shrimp were Great otherwise. I had catfish. Nice large piece. Lots of frys. Crispy and seasoned good. Get the cornbread or two. Nice complement to meal. Great place if not in Maryland."}
{"text":"First of all the atmosphere here is really welcoming! Perfect place to spend a Sunday afternoon watching a football game with friends and family. 

I started off with calamari sticks for appetizer ($9 for about 7 sticks) which were great but really wished they gave more. 
Then I order a pound of snow crab legs and a pound of shrimp both with the special trifecta sauce and level one on spice and level three on spice. 
I am warning you, the spices here are not a joke so if you're not good with spices like me, stick with a 1 at least and 2 if you want more of a kick. You will eventually start sweating but hey, it's worth it cause the food is so fresh and delicious! 


Highly recommend everyone to check this place out! You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, Ordering shrimp is not for the squeamish but thankfully the server said for an additional price they would remove the heads for me next time, yes I was squeamish and have never removed heads from shrimp before. We have returned here various times and absolutely love the experience. The prices are well worth it and even when it's absolutely packed we always seem to get a table. Love the wash bins for cleaning off the mess and No, you will never force me to wear a bib even though I would save the messy shirt if I would just listen...LOL.
Found out I was allergic to Cayenne pepper when I ordered the hot boil and contacted their management off their website. I ran through a few possible ingredients without them actually giving away their \"secret recipe\" and determined it was Cayenne. Management made recommendations to me on what to order next time to make sure a visit to the ER wasn't needed and we rolled with it. Lemon Pepper was absolutely delicious and I appreciated that they were willing to help me return and not write off this place. This place is great for large groups and well worth the experience. Thank you Autum!"}
{"text":"Awesome food!  Great service!!  Thank you Eric!  The king crab in the pacific rim sauce was worth the price per pound and my ruined manicure!"}
{"text":"How awesome is it, that this small chain of seafood (bayou inspired) restaurants is Arizona based? It's made even more awesome by the fact that they support local brewers and the Arizona Distilling Company! More on those facts later...

Once again, my girlfriend made a suggestion I couldn't refuse. We decided to grab lunch at the newest Angry Crab location in Goodyear. I've heard others talking favorably about this chain and I'm always down for sea food!

Sitting at the bar is one of our favorite things to do because the service tends to be a little better. Tracey took good care of us, was extremely friendly and made some great suggestions, including desert.

A couple draft beers (a Kilt Lifter and a Purple Haze) paired very well with our entrees. We chose a pound of mussels and a pound of snow crab with their Tri-Fecta sauce and medium heat. Wow! They don't mess around with the spices! Love the garlic! Throw in some potatoes and sausage and prepare to get a little messy!

Some people may be turned off by the idea of being served in a bag and having to work for your food. But if you're dining with the right person, and you know how to break down a lobster, it can be more fun than you realize. There's an intangible about dining like this because you're focused on the task, you're chatting, and you're constantly sharing the treasure you pried from the shell with your company. This was a fun meal!

The beer selection is more diverse than the average restaurant. While I would appreciate more local beers, I was happy my favorite from Four Peaks was present. And how about those spirits? They feature a vodka, a gin and a bourbon, all made in Tempe. I'm intrigued and will be looking for the Commerce Gin at my favorite beverage store. Once again, props to the Angry Crab Shack for featuring their products!

If you're craving a unique take on seafood, or looking for a fun, casual place, or simply want to explore a menu that features items like gator bites, the Angry Crab Shack needs to be on your radar!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have tried to order something different every time. Yelp should be giving me an expense account for all the research I do for them.

On to the food. The name of the restaurant is Angry Crab Shack & BBQ. In my opinion they should just concentrate on the fish portion of their Menu. The ribs are decent but I thought the pulled pork was below average and not enough meat. I guess if it's below average you wouldn't want to have more meat. So this problem has been solved. Don't order the pulled pork.

The fried Catfish is fabulous. You probably get about a pound of catfish filet swimming on some cajun fries in the basket. The fries are tasty and not laden down with spices. My favorite dish at this place is the Mahi. It's wood fired grilled to perfection. It's served over a bed of rice. My only complaint is the filet is a little smallish. I believe this entree is around the $10 dollar zone. This is the best Mahi I have ever had. So if you are looking for something very healthy and delicious, order the Mahi!

Most people order the fish boil. I really like how the Angry Crab puts the pricing on the napkin dispenser. It makes it easy to see what everything costs for the different type of seafood that is boiled. They have Mussels, Crabs, Lobster and Shrimp. Sorry if I left anyone out. So the boil comes in a bag and I can tell that butter has been generously used as part of the cooking process. You have a choice of the spices. I really enjoy the traditional spice. Many servers will push the Trifecta spice, but trust me, go with the traditional spice. You can also indicate the heat you want on the food. I like it tasty without burning my tongue please. So I go with level one as opposed to level 5.

Most of the servers seem to be pretty good. Although, I really don't like when a bus person is taking off the table cloth while I'm sitting at the table, that tends to make me an angry crab. This has only happened once so I'm thinking that the busser was a little anxious to turn the table over on a busy Friday night.

Everyone that we have taken here has enjoyed it. It's a great place to get together with friends at a reasonable price point."}
{"text":"Despite a 20' drive, this is our go-to seafood place. Made to order delectables, from crab to shrimp to yummy sausage, & tasty oysters. The salmon was especially amazing!
Not your quiet, romantic establishment. A fun atmosphere, but expect your ears to be split from time to time by the mega-decibel birthday siren. 
Great on-tap beer selection. Brig your appetite and pocketbook. Decent prices, but seafood doesn't come cheap."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd time at angry crab my first time at this location. 1st in Mesa, 2nd in Goodyear and 3rd at this location in Phoenix. My daughter was here visiting and I wanted her to try this place since she LOVES seafood. Let's start with the sweet potato fries...bland and cut to thick for my liking. I came for the shrimp which I ordered trifecta mild, but this time the mild seasoning was spicier than the precious 2 times and I DONT like spicy at all, my personality is spicy enough. We order the king crab legs the same way, they were just ok, kind of dry and definitely NOT worth $28 a pound. I will definitely be back to angry crab m, but I will just stick to the shrimp."}
{"text":"Fantastic! My wife and I were in AZ on vacation and some friends brought us here. The restaurant where the shopping center is located is nothing to write home about but there is plenty of parking. 

The service was friendly, fast, and explained the 'process' well. I had the King Crab Legs and my wife had the Shrimp. We both got the same Trifecta sauce and heat level not knowing where the 'barometer' for the heat is really set. The medium level (3?) has some kick, but people used to eating spicy food would probably be disappointed. The seasoning is delicious and the seafood was cooked great. I'd definitely wear the gloves when you are eating and maybe consider wearing two sets. It's very messy, and the amount of garlic is intense. The smell will last a long time without the gloves. 

Great experience, cool vibe, good beer choices, and great good. Cool joint!"}
{"text":"Reminds me of some similar themed places in California. Open dining area, outdoor seating as well. And seafood is sold by the pound at current market values. The crawfish they had when I went were on the runty side. Shrimp was perfect in size and taste, overall better value in my opinion. 

The seasoning is a little thin and oily side. And the spicyness. Seems tame. Ordered medium and even the hot. And there wasn't much of a difference. 

Staff is very attentive however. Always coming around to check on your drinks. 

You come with a party of four be prepared to drop a bill. But it's totally worth it. Also try the cornbread. Goes awesome with the crawfish!"}
{"text":"I'm never going to Joes Crab Shack again! The crab legs here are awsome! While I think this is a great place and recommend it to everyone, I only gave it four stars because the dungeness crab was yucky and there's nothing fresh on the menu - like a salad or vegetables. It's only shellfish and fried food. Nonetheless, if you haven't tried this place you gotta. I used to have my food seasoned trifecta, but I just realized that the original recipe is even better. I can usually handle spicy, but - word to the wise - spicy here really does mean spicy."}
{"text":"This review is specific to the location on Ray Rd and its sub-par status relative to the other locations.  This is based on our personal experience which was mind-blowing.

The pros:  The food was solid. The food basically met our expectations and was consistent with the other locations we've been to, and we have no complaints in terms of the food.

The cons:  I've honestly taken a week to post this review to let the experience really soak in, and I figured time may temper my feelings about what just happened.  So our family of four showed up on a Friday night after calling ahead and being told a 10-15 minute wait... no sweat.  In fact, a 30 minute wait isn't an issue for us typically.  That said, when we showed up the place was probably 3/4 full, and we were told it would be just a moment.  A few moments later another foursome arrived, and they were quickly taken to one of the open tables.  Raised some eyebrows, but no sweat.  A minute later, another group arrived, this time with six... again, we are waiting (the only ones waiting), and they are taken to another table in the middle of the dining area.  About twenty minutes after we started waiting, literally standing by the hostess, no fewer than 4 more groups were taken to their seats, some booths, others tables.  Finally the hostess said \"Okay, your table is ready, follow me.\"  We walked to an empty table right at the entrance, which had remained empty from before we arrived all the way through all of the other groups being seated.  When I commented \"Wow, we just waited nearly a half hour to be seated at a table that has been empty the entire time as others were quickly seated?!,\" she replied \"Well we had to make sure your table was ready.\"  Flabbergasted I just explained to my kids that sometimes things happen that just don't make sense.  

I typically tip very well, with 20% being the bare minimum even on mediocre experiences, and unless there is a reason to tip low.  I anticipated leaving a very low tip with this meal, especially when the service and attention was consistent with the hostess experience.  Other tables were being attended to, while our family found itself waiting quite a bit.  I still left the 20% tip for the meal, and we quietly left, never to return to this location.

Fortunately for us, there are multiple locations, and I'm happy to drive further for the experiences we've had in Mesa, etc."}
{"text":"Well as any good Yelper we tried several dishes and left miserably full because every thing was delicious. 

The oysters, ribs, gumbo, pulled pork, baked beans, Cajun fries and don't get me started on the onion rings were all great! 

The house wine is cheap and they have every local beer you could want. 

Make sure to stop by and give it a try! 
Thanks Angry Crab."}
{"text":"This was definitely out of the box.  I enjoyed the shrimp and snow crab in the bag.  It's a lot of food.  I tried the trifecta sauce.  the best corn bread. Great for sharing at the table. My first time here and yes I would come back again."}
{"text":"Delicious, hard to believe it's a chain. The oysters were fresh, the gumbo was outstanding, and the brisket was better than any BBQ I've had around here.  For sides we had the mac n cheese, the beans (both crazy good) and fries.  The cornbread was the only thing that was meh.  Our sever was Olivia and she made a ton of recommendations. She killed it. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"What a gem! It was well worth the hour wait. We both got the king crab trifecta, hubby got medium, I got hot and it was AMAZING! Possibly the best crab I've ever had. I added sausage and he had corn... Oh and we started with the Cajun fries - damn good. Quite a few reasonably priced ($5!) beers on tap, $4 wine and a full bar. Can't wait to go back and possibly try something else!"}
{"text":"We love this place! I alternate between crab, mussles, clams, depending on my mood but the rest of the fam get crab! My kids eat a pound of crab each!! The cajun fries are not to be skipped. I always get some veggies as well, they are always good and occasionally a slice of pineapple is included and delicious!!"}
{"text":"Just got done with our dinner experience here and it phenomenal From.service to food!"}
{"text":"I will not be back there ever again.  The only thing good were their French fries. I ordered fried clams and had to return them to get a new order of the same over cooked hard to eat, rubber bands. I also ordered the fried shrimp and those where horrible as well. They also only gave two baby pieces of lemon.  Had to ask for more of lemons, tarter sauce and cocktail sauce.  Terrible that I had to keep asking for stuff.  I do have to say that the staff were very nice.  No silverware,  just your hands and napkins. Ugh !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Taste of Louisiana and Ada's are awesome."}
{"text":"Okay here's the thing. 

I love this place. 

The first time I came here it was pure bliss. My man and I polished off four pounds of seafood and every last bite was unbelievable. We even had room for dessert, which was also delicious! Service by Ashley (I think?) was awesome! She was sweet, informative and prompt. 

On our second time here we came for my man's birthday and it was not as pleasant of an experience, unfortunately. Our servers (Brandon and his trainee, didn't catch her name) were great. Fast and friendly! Food? Still unreal. This time we had five pounds of seafood, multiple shots and cocktails. This is where things went sour for us. Problem number one: we asked for two Irish car bombs and they came out as two full beers and they were short on shot glasses so one shot was in a plastic cup (no big deal) but how am I supposed to chug a bomber short with a full beer?!!! Weird, but nothing to be upset about really. Next I ordered two of the same type of drink, the Dixie Peach, but since I CANNOT drink tequila I asked for mine with vodka. When they came out the girl who dropped them off was not our waitress, so I asked which was vodka and which was tequila, to which she had no clue. So I smelled and tasted both, as well as my boyfriend and they we're definitely both tequila, so we sent one back with no more than two sips depleted. The bartender, Miranda, proceeded to come over and pretty much argue with us that one was vodka. Look, I don't want anything comped, I'm not looking for q handout. I just want the drink I ordered!! I was offended that I was being argued with over something so easily fixable. I work at a bar and I give impeccable customer service, and I've never even considered arguing with a customer, even if I thought they were wrong! 


Overall this place is unbelievable! Brandon and his trainee are fabulous and deserve to be rewarded for their candor. I wish I could give it five stars but service is a priority to the fullest to me. And sadly today I have to dock a star for the bartender's attitude toward the situation. 


The manager, Derek, was super kind when we brought it up to him. We didn't expect anything in return and he was polite, listened and even gave us a $25 gift card for our next visit, which we did not expect!  Thanks to him for being the man! 


We will be back"}
{"text":"Ben was awesome!  Great food- some of the best service I've ever had!!  I loved my food- it was plentiful and tasted awesome!  Also- happy hour prices are hard to beat!!"}
{"text":"Food was yummy and fast.   Bummer though that they were out of dungeoness and blue crab."}
{"text":"This place is the absolute BOMB!!!!! love the Cod the Shrimp the Wings sweet potato fries and the Cajun ones too... snow crab.... now I see they added hush puppies and veggies. I need to go at least once a week. tonight is the night... Oh and good Root beer too. gonna try a glass of wine tonight.  if you like seafood this place is a must.........................."}
{"text":"Great for a large family celebration. Many options that can satisfy any seafood lover. Make sure to be prepared to wait, it is well worth your time."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried the Angry Crab today and found most of the food to be good but nothing outstanding or eventful. We had crawfish, blue crab, roast oysters, sausage and potatoes along with Abita Purple Haze draft. We liked the blend of seasonings at a mild level, but found most everything to be overcooked and mushy except the sausage and potatoes. Mushy crab really isn't appealing along with tiny roast oysters. 

Service was excellent and prompt though which enhanced the dining experience. I'm certain we'll try again since the Angry Crab itself was a fun place to dine, reminds you of bayou backwater type places with uplifting music and down home hospitality. Saw plenty of families and groups of friends gathered feasting and hanging for the afternoon."}
{"text":"The staff and atmosphere is great - however when it comes to the food, I am not impressed. Both visits I have had here have been disappointing. Boiled bags are overcooked and chewy. Fried foods are over seasoned. Seasonings are not very flavorful. 
This makes me sad because this place is so close by to where I live! I wanted it to be good. 
I would pick Hot & Juicy in Tempe over this place, every time."}
{"text":"I grew up in Florida and know good seafood. This place is a great value for the family and a fun atmosphere as well. Definitely something different!"}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place. I really wanted to love it. I am such a fan of seafood, and Cajun food in particular. I went to college in New Orleans, pre-Katrina and my family is also from the Gulf states. Anywho, my first visit to the Angry Crab was interesting and slightly disappointing. 

The wait was 45 minutes on a Friday night for a party of 5. Once we were seated the waitress took our drink orders. They ask if you've ever been there so that you know how to order. Basically everything is a la cart and by the pound on the menu. We ordered 1lb each of crawfish, snow crab legs, and 2lbs shrimp. Corn, potatoes, and andouille sausage were all extra also. We ordered the trifecta seasoning, mild, which was the best seasoning option according to the waitress. The food came out in steam bags and was placed on our table for \"low country boil\" shared type eating. 

The seafood was fresh and hot, and they bring your 1bs of seafood as it's cooked by the kitchen, not all at once. Each type is in its own bag, not all in the same bag for the flavors to mix and melt into each other, which I would have preferred. Additionally, the seasoning/sauce flavor you choose is put into the bag likely AFTER the seafood is steamed, which means it just sits on top of the shells and never absorbs into the seafood, which takes away from the flavor profile. 

I frequent Hot & Juicy, and in comparison I prefer Hot and Juicy. The pricing is about the same, but H&J's flavor profile kills Angry Crab's. 

Also, I didn't like that long after we left the seafood smell of the place was stuck to my infant son's car seat, our clothes, even our shoes. That never happens at H &J, which I frequent at least every other week. 

I give Angry Crab a 2.5 out of 5, but since there wasn't a half star, I'll give them a 3 for effort. I would return again with a group if it was their choice but not on my own. It was just ok.... but for that price I'd prefer Hot & Juicy."}
{"text":"Meal was mediocre, service was so-so. The music was too loud and we had a surly waitress.  Prices were high. I was very disappointed in our dining experience. I would not recommend. Joe's Crab Shack has this place beat hands down."}
{"text":"One word:

TRIFECTA

This is what makes this place a gem. It is their sauce they put on the seafood boils. It is the Kajun, Lemon Pepper, and Garlic. Oh my stars this sauce is everything. You can rank the spice of your sauce 1-5. We got the 3 (I can't feel my lips). It was very accurate. The beers we got on draft helped us with the spice. If you like spice I would say this is a good option. If you can't handle any spice I would probably recommend the 1, or even the 0.  We ended up getting two pounds of snow crab, added sausage and corn, and real butter. I think we got fries? I don't remember, the crab was the star, we ended up ordering another 2 pounds of crab. 

We left so pleased with our experience. The waitress was really nice and helped up find some spots to go to for the rest of our stay in Phoenix. Don't let the fact that this is in a shopping center detour you."}
{"text":"This place is great. We love the food and the service is always good. The crab legs and mussels are our favorite."}
{"text":"So who was the first person to see a giant sea spider in the ocean and say, I'm going to boil that sucker and it's going to be delicious! If you know, thank him for us!

Our Family birthday party group of 6 arrived at 5:45 hoping to be sat by 6 pm and it worked our flawlessly, which was great, because we know the west valley has been craving a place like this for a long time. Also being that the place was just recently opened we thought it was going to be packed, and half way expected to belly up to the bar for a bit.

As we were seated the wait staff immediately greeted us and took drink orders. We ordered a couple draft beers and a fuzzy navel (I can't make this stuff up). The beer was cold and served in a frosty pint glass, the fuzzy navel however \"had like zero schnapps in it\". As soon as we told the wait staff she immediately addressed it and brought my Mother the ideal drink, in a short glass, that looked real deal. So kudos for the immediate mediation of an issue, love it.

After we got drinks we ordered appetizers, which for us tonight we wanted to try and get a couple different things, we did the frog legs, and gator nuggets. Which are both deep fried and delicious. 

When it came time to order entrees, the 6 of us were ready to go! All together we ordered probably 4 pounds of king crab legs (which might have been some of the biggest I've ever seen), a  2 lb dungeoness crab, 3 pounds of Shrimp, 2 Pounds of Mussels (which were cooked perfectly), Fried clams, 2 slices of cornbread (mmhm), and a fried cod basket, which comes with french fries. We all thoroughly enjoyed our meal for the most part. 

When they brought out crab cracking utensils we were a little bit thrown off, they brought us 4 pairs of what look like industrial shear type scissors and 2 good sized rocks, like that you would find outside in some beautiful desert landscaping. So we were just going to roll with it. The Shears worked like a champ, I would take these over almost any other instrument to \"cut\" through the crab shell to get to the good stuff. As a whole we thought the rock was a little less successful, you kind of send shrapnel at everyone around you, but again, worth it to get to the good stuff. 

My advice, even if you don't really do spice, at least try to go with \"Wimpy Trifecta\" this is what my better half had (she's a spice wimp for sure) and she loved it. My sister had the Garlic with her mussels and dungeoness and was unimpressed, as it was just garlic and a bit of oil for the most part, so being the wonderful older brother I am, I shared a little of my Trifecta Medium sauce and when mixing them together it worked out just fine.

To us going to a place like this is nice for multiple reasons. Obviously everyone is busy so it is nice to sit down to a great hot meal, that takes a while to get through and just enjoy each others company for a couple hours. The service here was wonderful, we enjoyed it. I also consider it to be superior to Joe's Crab shack, or Hot and juicy at Westgate. 

Also they have Rudy's like troughs to wash off after your meal, which was a big deal for me. Way to go Angry Crab!"}
{"text":"Ate here for our first time last Sunday, I was very shocked with how low the cost was and how AMAZING the food and service was. Vann was our server, he showed us the ropes and made perfect recommendations. We will definitely be coming back. Thanks for the awesome experience Vann, you restored my faith in dining out!"}
{"text":"I like this type of seafood restaurant, can really satisfy your appetite. Always a line in front of the door waiting to be seated. I've been to other Cajun style seafood restaurant, their price and portion is the winner, just a little bit salty from my perspective."}
{"text":"What a great concept! Love the variety of seafood. If you like to get down and dirty and have some amazing food this is def the place for you. Had the pleasure of meeting the owner Dan. Great guy!!! Best dungeons crab and I am from Alaska ;)"}
{"text":"We loved this place. We had little kids visiting asking for crab and seen this on check please so wanted to try it.  It had a great fun energy. Its very busy and pretty messy but good quality and tasty food. The service could be a little better, You must add the hush puppies and sausage to whatever you order. They were the best!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure who decided to combine a southern style seafood restaurant with a BBQ joint but that man deserves some sort of humanitarian award for his efforts in making stomachs and taste buds very excited.

Came here with my girlfriend on a Saturday night after hearing great reviews from other yelpers. We did have about a 45 minute wait but it was well worth it and kind of fun to track using the app they use.

I got the shrimp with sausage, potatoes, corn and the trifecta sauce medium spicy. My girlfriend got the snow crab with trifecta sauce mild. Everything was fantastic and thank god we got the warning from the waiter that the spices run hot as even the medium gave me a nice little burn without impacting flavor. The flavors were fantastic and there is just something fun about getting all that juicy goodness by peeling your food by hand and dunking in the sauce. My only gripe was that my shrimp were over cooked just enough to get a bit mealy. 

The corn was fantastic and just absorbed all the butter it was cooked in and the trifecta sauce making for a ton of flavor that hits your taste buds in a rush. The potatoes were good as well and what you expect. The 

Now you're probably asking yourself about the BBQ I mentioned and why I haven't discussed that, the answer is I was saving the best for last. Much like we did with our meal where we pushed the BBQ to the side while the seafood took the focus. In hindsight waiting may have been a mistake. We ordered a 1/2lbs of the pulled pork along with some corn bread and man was it good. Not only was it good it was it good it was some of the best pulled pork I have had, and not just in AZ. While not quite on par with my favorites in St. Louis it also wasn't far being either. Was not dried out, had a great smokey flavor while other subtleties of the spice rub used came through. Not to mention that was the biggest 1/2lbs pile of meat I have seen. The BBQ sauce was good as well but not even needed and that says a lot from a sauce lover like me. The cornbread was also great not too mealy and just the right level of sweetness.

I will be back at Angry Crab soon for more delicious goodness especially when it felt like we dined like kings and queens for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Tried the BBQ platter, brisket, ribs, and pulled pork. Both sauce options were pretty good. For the money tho.. you really don't get much. The brisket was the best by far, very smoky and tender, thus the 3 stars I gave. The ribs were okay, but there was only 3 tiny ribs...disappointing. The pork was just ok. I've had better in Tempe and ahwatukee. Service was ok but only some servers had it together. Ambiance was typical of a BBQ place, good laid back spot to have a brew and watch a football game. Unlike other reviews I read I didn't feel like it was loud at all."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. We had the Oysters, Calamari, Dungeness, Snow, King, Lobster, Shrimp, and Sausage, with the Trifecta and level one. We really enjoyed ourselves. The food was spot on what we wanted. Jinifer our waitress was beyond perfect and her customer service was just great."}
{"text":"Attended the Yelp UYE set up by Arana here. There were 8 of us in our yelp group. Very casual decor with butcher paper on the tables and customer writing on the walls. What a great time. They have a couple of sinks to wash up when you are done eating (you WILL need this amenity). The server brought beverages as soon as we sat down and took our orders as soon as we had a chance to look over the menu.

I had the snow crab with the trifecta sauce with a heat level of 2 (zero is no spice and 4 is super hot). I had a red potato cooked in the bag as well. The total for this fine food was $15.50, but be aware that all of the seafood is at market prices and will vary from visit to visit. It was delicious and the sauce was just the perfect level of spice for me. If you order a \"boil\" dinner it comes to you in clear plastic back with the seafood, juices and spices. Even though the expectation is that you will eat this food with your hands, they will bring you a fork at your request (I asked for one to eat my red potato).

They do crank up an air raid siren every time someone orders heat level 4 and that can be kind of startling--gave me flashbacks to elementary school in the 1950s and the atomic bomb drills we used to have. Parking is plentiful and close to the door. I would recommend this place to anyone with a hankering for seafood."}
{"text":"Awesome, cool place. Wife and I shared snow crab and crawfish. Seasoned with trifecta at a level 2. Little tingle with the heat but not over powering. Erik was our server and he made it a fun experience. Definitely will be back with the in-laws."}
{"text":"I liked this place. There are NO utensils. Which isn't a bad thing, just something you should know going in. I ordered the angry crab Bloody Mary which comes with a crab leg inside of it. The Bloody Mary was good. Crab was good. I ordered mine as a 2 on their spicy scale and I didn't find it that spicy (they claimed it would be spicy even at a 2). It's not a place you'd call someone and say \"omg you have to go here\" but is worth checking out for sure"}
{"text":"Crab boil served on the table. Really hot if you go hot. Really good though. I had more mild king crab legs that were excellent. Bread was hot and fresh. Sweet potato fries were so good. Everyone loved it but it was messy."}
{"text":"A family favorite, we've been here a few times and love to meet up with our peeps to enjoy a good time! Never disappointed once, even though I'll warn you, the noise level is high. People are obviously happy eating here! We have enjoyed the gumbo and hush puppies as appetizers. Our delicious entrees have included the boiled shrimp with various sauces (I love the Pacific Rim) and varying degrees of heat, shrimp baskets with fries, both white and sweet potato, awesome BBQ beans, corn on the cob, and sausage added to our shrimp bags. Never have had room for dessert, so hope we can try that someday! We also hope to get brave enough to try the Gator Nuggets! This is a MUST try restaurant!"}
{"text":"Unusual entrance, it's on the side of the building. We were greeted promptly and on a Sunday night at 6pm the place was packed. Hostess told us about a 15 min wait for a table and the wait seemed shorter than expected. The place is one large room so the noise level is high. Butcher paper on the tables and plastic bibs, usual seafood stuff. The food came out in drips and drabs but we were told this at the beginning. Natalie, our server was very knowledgable and very courteous. She explained how the menu works. I ordered the dungeons crab. Came out hot and cooked perfectly as ordered. Food was tasty and if you don't mind getting dirty and eating with your hands, this is the place. I asked about happy hour. Would love to see lots of fun oyster shooters there. Will def be back!"}
{"text":"We go there at least once every month or two. My girlfriend loves their shrimp and Bloody Mary and I always order the two meat plater with chicken and ribs and side of BBQ beans ! Great food and atmosphere. We usually go there on Sunday nights so it's not super busy but it's almost always packed. Great place and super yummy food."}
{"text":"This is the closet restaurant to us with this concept. Flavors are great and they really capture the Cajun boil!!! Service is good. Interesting that they have barbecue too. I didn't get barbecue but uncle that came with us stated the barbecue sauce seemed like it had a little too much vinegar with it. I would def come back for the sea food but feel like if you are craving barbeque there's better out there. Definitely worth trying for yourself at least once here. We've been here a few times and have plans to come back!!"}
{"text":"Been to a few places with the same concept. This place taste like most of the others. Not the best. However because they are one of the few in the area, they do get pretty busy. So service is meh.They use the list to do their waiting list. ( a service that text or calls you when your table is ready rather than the buzzer). It's nice to see where you're at on the list."}
{"text":"As a lover of seafood, Angry Crab has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants in the valley. The food is delicious, the atmosphere is fun, and the service is quick (though you may have to wait for a table).

While normally I gravitate to New England style seafood, Angry Crab sure hits the spot when I want a big bag of buttery and spicy mussels. Just be careful with the spice level! Start out low and work your way up. Even most spicy food lovers I know don't usually go above level 3.

If you get JK as your server, be prepared for a man who is larger than life! He's a great guy, with a passion for food, and he'll make sure that you're well taken care of.

Also... don't say no to the hush puppies. I may come for the delicious seafood boils, but the hush puppies are my weakness. One of these days I'm gonna get like 10 orders to go. 

Be prepared to get messy, but don't worry... they give you a bib. You'll need it."}
{"text":"Well, I am going to be the downer, but I probably won't be back unless someone else wants to go. We had shrimp, snow crab, fried clams and hushpuppies. First, I had never been here and didn't read reviews. So imagine my surprise when our waitress plops a mini garbage bag in front of me. I knew items were cooked in the bag but I didn't realize they were served this way too. The only 'dishes' were a fork and the alcoholic drink glasses. The shrimps had their heads, which grossed me out. Both the shrimp and the crab were covered in sauce and so ungodly messy that I just really didn't enjoy it like I wanted to. Call me a prissy, no gunk on my hands, girl, but I just really didn't like the experience. The food itself was good and the service was ok, but I just don't know if this place is for me."}
{"text":"So this is my 10th Check in here... I'll tell you this, there's going to be way more to come! I have absolutely and completely fell in love with their Shrimp (Trifecta, Hot). The first time I came here I got a shrimp po boy but I wasn't a fan because they had Cole slaw on it and the next time we came I got shrimp and ever since then I have gotten the same thing. There have been some bad server experiences but I have to say Server JEFF is the MAN!!!!! He made our experience 100x better with his great customer service. GREAT ATMOSPHERE GREAT FOOD . A MUST TRY!!!"}
{"text":"We frequent the other two locations of Angry Crab, so we've been anxiously awaiting the grand opening of their Ahwatukee location.  As expected, the AC crew did not disappoint.  The BBQ is outstanding - ooohhh, the pulled pork!  This location also has a variety of flatbread pizzas that are perfectly cooked in their impressive new pizza oven.  The seafood boils are killer, and always wow the senses.  The Ahwatukee crowd should be super stoked that they now have an Angry Crab & BBQ in their neighborhood!"}
{"text":"If you are from the south or have had crawfish in the south, please do not think this is going to be anything like that. This is a West coast interpretation of crawfish. As a native that was born/raised in Louisiana and have enjoyed a many crawfish boils back home, I feel I'm qualified to say that. 
The pros: nice sized crawfish, cooked well, vast majority of fully intact crawfish, the potatoes were well cooked. Customer service was fast and efficient. 

The cons: the first bag of crawfish were great but the second bag was full of the little ones that get forgotten in the pot and are pasty in texture bc they are over cooked, the cup of minced garlic that's already lost all flavor in each bag is a bit much, not enough salt, no Cajun/Creole flavor (especially not with the house sauce), mild is more like medium.

How to fix: I think their method and flavors are best suited to things other than crawfish. Honestly, it would probably be amazing with their other seafood options. If you get the crawfish, get them plain and bring your own seasoning to dip them in (or bring them home and enjoy)."}
{"text":"I have never had BBQ in Arizona until coming here but I am happy I did. I ordered King Crab legs and BBQ chicken with spicy bbq sauce. I arrived early and had Tilted Kilt Red Ale which was great. Service was friendly and prices are over $10 but food is cooked correctly and sauces are delicious."}
{"text":"I needed some spicy food to fight off the cold and decided to try Mesa Angry Crab Shack and I am pleased I did . I ordered 1lb shrimp and Trifecta sauce with 2nd level heat. I got home opened the bag and started work on the shrimp which were cooked well and very spicy. I spent $17 with veteran discount which is really good. Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Can't believe I took this long to visit. This place will be a regular stop, and we have so many options here. Great relaxed and casual atmosphere. Service was spot on, and the fried catfish was excellent. I'll be baaaack."}
{"text":"I love seafood, and am always excited to get to try a new location.  I also love that Angry Crab usually has blue crab.  A favorite from growing up in Virginia.  I must say though, I was very disappointed.  It seems that they boil their crabs instead of steaming them, and the result is a pile of mush.  For those who are familiar with blue crab, it is a lot of work for a little bit of meat.  Imagine my disappointment when I get the inside of the crab, and the meat was all mush and lacking flavor.  I do not think I will go back to this location."}
{"text":"Maybe 4.5. The little woman wanted some seafood and I was reluctant to head to the casino but, I had spotted the Angry Crab on a previous trip to Goodyear. I read some reviews and said let's get some seafood! She was confused when I headed in the opposite direction from the casino.  Ordered the snow crab and jumbo shrimp (with  sausage). Good thing I remembered how to eat shrimp served with their heads on!! Had the trifecta sauce-just the right temp for both of us. Yes, eating out of a bag can be messy.  All in all, it was a pleasant change of venue, the food and service were definitely ok. I think I'd have to agree, a surprising, fun little place in the middle of the desert (and Goodyear-of all places)! My one recommendation would be - bring out some warm, lemony wash clothes for the cleanup!"}
{"text":"One of the more fun places to casually experience the splendors of the sea.  There are enough options to satisfy most appetites and the prices are very reasonable.  Probably best to go and order as a group as you have to commit to a full lb of whatever you order.  It would be nice if you could mix and match in 1/2lb increments."}
{"text":"I love good seafood, and this place doesn't disappoint.  Having lived near the Gulf Coast for years, I was a little skeptical about how good the seafood would be in the middle of the desert.  But Angry Crab Shack doesn't disappoint.

We've had quite a few of their different types of seafood, but our favorites are the snow crab, king crab, shrimp, and fresh crawfish (when in season).  Can't recommend the Trifecta Medium/Hot sauce enough - it's ADDICTIVELY GOOD!  

There can be a wait near prime meal time 6-8pm, so get there early, or later, or be prepared to wait.  But they've got a bar with plenty of adult drinks to keep you well hydrated."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely incredible! The seafood is fresh and delicious. It's a casual environment that's comfortable for all age groups. Who doesn't enjoy eating with their fingers, using lots of napkins, licking their fingers, wearing a bib and consuming tasty food? On our first visit today, we had a pound of shrimp and a pound of muscles. Be sure to order a side of bread,  served warm, to soak up the broth inside your bag. An ear of corn and a couple of potatoes to go with your seafood makes a tasty appetizer into a meal. Happy hour prices for beer and wine are quite reasonable. We are so glad to have found this place and shall surely become regulars."}
{"text":"Went there last night with 9 people at 6:00. They weren't very busy at that time. 3 of us received our order at 6:20. By 6:50 the other people in our party were still waiting. Spoke to a manger who wouldn't make eye contact and made excuses that burgers take a long time to make, and I it would be right out. By 7:10, still nothing. By 7:15, one person received their meal. By 7:20 we had to go, and two people never had a meal. And no apology from the staff or manager, just \" we won't charge you for the meals you didn't receive \" !! Really, Mr Manger?!?  That goes without saying. So odd. Will never be back. The service was horrendous"}
{"text":"I love love love the concept of this restaurant - paper table cloths, mason jar glassware, food served in a plastic container (gumbo) or bag instead of a plate.  I've give the place five stars for the fun concept alone, but to be honest the service left a bad taste in my mouth.  

The food was pretty good - I ordered the gumbo, which I'd recommend although it was heavy on the rice, and the king crab legs with the trifecta sauce (lemon pepper, garlic, and cajun).  The king crab legs were good, but I'd get it without sauce next time.  

The service was good overall except that when I got there there was a wait and the guy at the host station offered to give my information to the hostess so that she could put my name into the computer, which he never did.  Then, I asked for a refill on my drink and that never came.  I don't know if this place has just gotten enough traction that they don't care, but these are easy things to do to make the customer feel valued.  I'm glad I tried it and I love the concept, so go ahead and try it, but I don't know if I'll be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have been there 4 times. I pretty like it so  far. The servers should use gloves  when they take out  all the thing that left on the table or just leave it there bc that is the rolling paper for. The food is great,  the service is  just okie.  The owner is very open and willing  to change for the better idea.  I can tell.  Anyway thank you for the business, i dont need to go California often."}
{"text":"This place is great!!! We ordered King Crab in the Trifecta Sauce with Corn, amazing! We went wimpy because the sauce creeps up on you, with just one pound of Crab we got stuffed! We also tried their alligator bites in a cajun breading, my first time trying it and it was good as well, like chicken and not too chewy. Cant wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Greasy, greasy greasy. My sister LOVES this place. She brought me here for lunch once. The environment is cool, the staff is super friendly. I ordered the shrimp basket. I also had the baked beans and corn bread and honestly the food is subpar, in my opinion. Tasted like it came straight out of a can. The fries were okay though, but when aren't fries good?

She invites me to go back every weekend and I respectfully decline every time."}
{"text":"Super bummed about this place. Really wanted to like it. Our shrimp basket was cold and our shrimp boil lacked flavor even though we got the trifecta and level 4 in spice. The sausage had the weirdest texture. Almost shriveled, it just didn't look right. Probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Took my mom and step dad here last weekend after hearing great reviews from my friends. Food was excellent, place was clean and the server was pretty attentive. We got King Crab Legs, Snowcrab legs and a whole lobster with the trifecta sauce. It was all excellent and the sausage and corn were as well. Mom had some ribs also and those were great too. Bit of a wait on Sunday night but was only 10-15 minutes. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the way the menu works - I really wanted to try a bit of everything but Angry Crab only lets you order a minimum of 1 pound of each type. So unless you come with 5 or more people, or have a huge appetite and $200+ to spend, there is no way to have more than 2-3 things of the 9 different kinds of fresh seafood on the menu. It would be nice if they had a some type of combo offering like Joe's but other than that - it was excellent."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to the Angry Crab yet, and you enjoy seafood... you.are.missing.out. Some friends and I headed over here for my birthday this year and it was fantastic! Don't think this is any ordinary seafood joint... you're gonna have to get down and dirty to enjoy your food, as no utensils are given to you. Somehow, it makes it that much more of an experience! I would highly recommend the crab legs and the shrimp! YUM!"}
{"text":"My family and I got one lb of shrimp with Cajun sauce and one lb with the trifecta sauce and both were amazing. The sweet potato fries, Cajun fries, and potato salad were delicious sides! Can't wait to go back and try the crab!"}
{"text":"So, every Tuesday some friends and I go out to eat. This place has been the choice every tuesday for the past month. Everytime i have gone its been amazing, the crab is perfect, but the service is not always the best. Last time i went i was not so happy though. There was barley any crab in the legs i had, and the cajun fries were almost just regular fries because there was so little seasoning. Over all, this place is amazing i love it! but my last visit was not the best."}
{"text":"The crew of the Angry Crab made us feel welcomed and service was tremendous.  Every water fill, every additional sauces or side orders, no problem.  Great staff.  Oh, and the food was amazing.  We celebrated a birthday with a family of 5 and had such a good time.  Free dessert to birthday person."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to give the Angry Crab a try. Wow! Outstanding food and great table side service. 

We both ordered the Snow Crab, Trifecta seasoning with medium heat. The crab was sweet and the flavors work so well together. I also order the calamari, simply fantastic! Solid strips of calamari with the perfect breading, cooked to perfection.

As some have noted here, the heat is nothing to laugh at- be very careful and if you have any question, ask the wait staff. They want you to enjoy yourself so they will tell you- if you like normal hot, stick to medium.

We will never go to Joe's Crab Shack again........."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in shellfish with freshness and over cooking.  The mussels were frozen greenlip and so over done they were chewy and rubbery.  A seafood place should be able to turn over enough to by cases of live mussels.  I was as a similar place in Colorado called Yabby Hut and all the seafood was in tanks alive and they would walk over a remove you crab, clams,  shrimp etc.  Here everything taste frozen.  I had king crab that was missing the soft,  jucy,  succulent sweetness of quality king crab. The meat was just ok at best and over cooked. Shrimp were good with head on but again over cooked. 

Service was excellent.  The place was packed.  Over all better than Red Lobster but miles off the mark from your finer seafood places."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and fun atmosphere! We definitely will be going back!! I ordered the king crab legs. They were delicious!! My husband said his food was the best BBQ he's ever had. I tried some and I have to agree!!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!  Staff is excellent, food is amazing! Quality of the seafood is above par, and I highly recommend it. It's casual dining and they make you feel like you are at home. My cousin and I eat here once a month, faithfully, sometimes twice a month. Customer service is always on point every single time. Get ready to get your hands dirty and definitely wear the bib! You're gonna LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"A fun little adventure spot. Time to get down and dirty so don't wear your Sunday best. Lots of options for some hand grubbed and finger lickin good times. I recommend the shrimp and blue crab but eating blue crab is no simple task. Grab a couple beers and while you're at it wrote on the walls. A fun place for the kiddos too!"}
{"text":"I've not been to the Angry Crab for a few years, so I thought I'd visit again, looking for a Cajun seafood 'fix' (October 2017).  I grew up on Cajun and creole cooking, and was in fact taught how to cook Creole style by my grandfather (who looked and sounded a lot like Justin Wilson).  So I feel I can comment/judge cajun cooking with some authority.

Unfortunately, the Mesa Angry Crab missed the mark.  

I ordered a bowl of gumbo.  It reminded me of nothing except Campbell Soup's toned down version of Gumbo.  The roux was very light, to my taste barely cooked.  The shrimp were salad shrimp, too small to notice, really.  There was a tiny smattering of overcooked rice.  Overall the texture was gooey and the flavor was very, very bland.  I know there are as many styles of gumbo as there are cooks, but this was an embarrassment for the price ($7.00). Frankly, it seemed like last week's left-overs.

I also ordered the Shrimp Basket.  Again, it was delivered promptly (great staff).  The shrimp were reminiscent of Gorton's Frozen shrimp in the Grocery freezer section.  Medium to small, they had so much breading that it overwhelmed the tasteless shrimp.  There was a ton of 'cajun' fries.  These were pretty good, albeit stuck together in clumps of 2-4 fries.

My total bill was $18 plus change and a tip, so $22 overall for a meal I could have made with Campbell's soup and a half packet of Gorton's frozen fried shrimp for maybe $4.00.   

Too bad.  I guess I should have just ordered boiled crawfish.  It's pretty hard to screw those up."}
{"text":"Kind of a hole in the wall shop. Not a fine dinning establishment. They keep the costs low by using paper plates, table clothes and plastic utensils. The boils are a unique item not found anywhere near us. It is decent food with the flavors melded according to you choices, which were many. We will have to go back and try to adjust until the flavors match. All in all, it is a good experieince."}
{"text":"It's a Five

If you have ever driven past the Angry Crab Shack,  I am certain you noticed the packed parking lot and smelled the amazing aroma in the air. So, if you enjoy seafood, like I do, then Angry Crab Shack is calling your name. 

Angry Crab Shack gives new meaning to the word casual. The formica topped tables are covered with white butcher paper, people eat with their hands, and writing on the walls is not only allowed, it's encouraged.

Angry Crab Shack is top notch and serves some of the best seafood Arizona has to offer. Sure, one could argue that Coastal towns may have better seafood, but Angry Crab Shack can definitely hold their own.

On my first visit, our server explained everything to us and gave suggestions based on our preferences.  Your entree comes out as it's ready instead of all together. Angry Crab Shack has a team restaurant philosophy, food is delivered by the first person closest to the kitchen when the food is ready. 

Initially, there was some confusion among the servers. Our table was delivered a basket of cornbread,  which I thought was complimentary, however,  it was for the table behind us (found that out after eating the basket) and for the record the corn bread was delicious.

I enjoyed ordering off Angry Crab's Menu. You pick your main course, which is sold by the pound. Then you pick your sauce, next you choose how spicy you want your entrée . The boil bag is brought to your table and everything is finger food. That's right, no utensils. You even get a rock to bash your crustaceans.  Thankfully a plastic bib is given and be sure to wear your bib, because you will need it.

The prices are reasonable and food is very good.  You should give this place a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This was a great! It was really nice to get shell fish that didn't taste like a fish tank. The customer service was very caring and ready to answer any questions. I will not be going back to a chain sea food restaurant."}
{"text":"The service was really poor and the food wasn't good. When I asked the waiter was in the Gumbo. He told me he didn't know because it was premade. Which is probably why it tasted old."}
{"text":"This place is a must go! Don't wear your Sunday bests cause you gonna get dirty. Wait staff was excellent. Felt like I was in Louisiana. Great for family or after work function but no first dates unless she's a seal or she don't mind seeing you tear int to the business end of a Lobster"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the establishment was great. I liked how there wasn't a long wait and the food was good. Took a few bites from different food my friends order like the fried cod fish, fried shrimp, and fried catfish. The breading for it was on point. The reason why I'm only giving it 3 stars is because the crawfish had absolutely no taste to it. The crawfish was pretty much steamed and than tossed in their seasoning. The seasoning I order was the Trifecta which was really oily and didn't leave any flavor. The crawfish were fresh, which is a plus, but the way its cooked, it absolutely had no flavor to it. I come from the south and the way its supposed to be cooked is in the broth with all the seasoning. You want to cook all the seasoning into the crawfish. So when you start tearing it apart and eating it, all the great flavors would be soaked into it. Overall, the price was decent. As expected because majority of crawfish comes from the gulf of mexico and I'm sure it cost alot just to habe it shipped fresh. I would recommend it for those that want to try the battered stuff. Just not the crawfish."}
{"text":"food was good but was a little over priced for the amount you recieve. don't understand the whole thing with the rock. would have been nice to have a plate and utensils. not a first date kind of place. but all in all food was great and service was quick. 
if you go get ready to get messy!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The service is great, the food is great and the overall atmosphere of the place is great! We were a party of four and was greeted and seated very fast. No waiting in line around 5pm. (Just FYI the line was forming around 7pm) They do have a happy hour for appetizers and drinks in the bar area, and drinks only in the main dining ($1.00 off all drinks). We had Ashley and she was great. She was always refilling our drinks and she was very personable. She made the whole experience enjoyable. The seafood was out of this world. It was excellent. Our party shared a 1.5 lb lobster, 1 lb mussels, 1lb snow crab and 1lb shrimp. You order by the pound, add your seasonings (highly recommend the TRIFECTA) and the amount of heat (level 2 was perfect). The food was hot, tasty, and cooked to perfection. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Returned for another meal this evening.  We ordered a crawfish po-boy sandwich with fries and coleslaw.  The sandwich consisted of an abundance of cold crawfish salad on a hoagie roll and I stuffed the coleslaw in with the crawfish.  It didn't have a lot of flavor. The fries were well seasoned and crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, the best part of the meal!  My wife had the fried shrimp basket with fries and a side of about 10 hush-puppies.  The shrimp were heavily breaded and a bit spicy.  It would have been nice if the breading were lighter.  Service was excellent and friendly, Michelle was our server. The lemonade my wife had was excellent.  A 3 to 3 1/2 star meal.  I'm not sure I want to return."}
{"text":"This place absolutely rocks! 
Great atmosphere, good food, friendly staff.
Been to many seafood & bbq places all around-
The service here is unlike any other..
Again a huge thank you to our great and friendly Waitress Shelby! Give this woman a RAISE!
Thanks again for a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to a place like this for awhile now. Finally got to try it out. I was between this place and hot and juicy, and I'm glad I chose Angry Crab! It was def everything that the reviews said. I ordered the shrimp (hot, with trifecta, and sausage). DELICIOUS!!! There was so many shrimp (at least 15), I was shocked. They were huge shrimp also (JUMBO). I ordered it headless and paid $2 more. I was hoping that headless meant they were pealed as well. I don't think next time I would order headless because you still have to peel the shrimp regardless. The sausage was HUGE! It was 4 pieces of it (making up a whole sausage). I don't think I would order the sausage next time, not because it's not good but because it's just wayyyy too much food and heavier. I would get the veges next time. I would definitely recommend this place, it's a food experience must! I hope everyone enjoys!"}
{"text":"Loved angry crab when it was on the Alma School location, but was SOOO pleasantly surprised when they opened this location minutes from my house! 

Love the price per portion. Always feel like we left satisfied and didn't pay ridiculous seafood prices. Flavored are awesome. Love the trifecta crab and shrimp. GET THE SAUSAGE! Super good. 

Staff is friendly and we have never had service concerns here. 

I could go on for days.We are regulars for life!"}
{"text":"GREAT service, food, and drink AND fair prices.  Had the shrimp boil with the 'trifecta' (garlic, lemon pepper, kajun) sauce and the level 3 hotness.  Added 4 pieces sausage and a potato to the bag.  They didn't have Blue Moon beer so had the recommended Papago Orange Blossom Ale which is NOW my new favorite beer.  The shrimp was FRESH and can't believe they sold it for $12 a pound.  Others in party had equally good mussels, snow crab, and more shrimp.  Will be back here again and again."}
{"text":"Great place!   Very busy on a Sat night.  20 min wait, but once we got in service was FAST.  Very helpful and friendly staff.   Food was great too... Try the chargrilled oysters!   We will be back."}
{"text":"Love the trifecta seasoning!!! So delicious. Got my seafood fix and well worth the trip from Maricopa for a nice family dinner. We ordered king crab legs, mussels, clams & shrimp for our party of 5. It was a really busy night that our waitress forgot a few drinks we ordered but it wasn't a big deal. The mussels are alright. Its not as plump or large and sea side fresh but better than some places that serve frozen shriveled up muscles where you can taste the freezer burn. Our waitress was nice enough to give us another pound of clams since the first one we got was a bag full of clam shells and almost no meat at all. The rest was good. The atmosphere was extremely crowded that it was humid, hot and  the spaces were tight to move around in to get to the restroom. Over all our experiences was good."}
{"text":"It was my first time. I'm only familiar with Red Lobster as far as seafood goes. The server Deb was very helpful. The atmosphere is fun. It took me about 45 minutes going at it cracking my lobster that's the whole fun of it and wearing those silly bibs. It was fun getting messy.  Great fries, great food! Great service! We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is about Cajun seafood.  They have \"baskets\", but the most popular is the \"per pound\" section.  There you order the protein (crawfish, shrimp, etc), the sauce/seasoning, and the heat level.  They bring it out in plastic bags and you eat with your fingers.  Bibs provided.  Several people in our group did that.  I opted for a catfish basket and gumbo.

The decor is supposed to look like a dive you might find in the bayou, as near as I can tell.  Everything has graffiti on it, and it's all very basic.  I don't think it adds anything to the experience, frankly.

My catfish was very good.  Fried perfectly with good breading.  There was a dipping sauce which added some nice flavor to it.  The \"Cajun fries\" were fine.  I've had better, but they were good enough.  Also included in the basket was \"sausage\".  Polish sausage for some reason.  Really??????  Ummm...Cajun means Andouille, people!  Not Polish.  The Polish was fine, but out of place.  

Lastly was my gumbo.  First, for the quantity it was expensive.  And then they didn't even add rice.  Gumbo is served with rice!  There should have been at least that much gumbo served on a quarter cup of rice.  For $6 I would expect at least that. Finally, it was salty.  Not extremely salty, but noticeable.  The flavor probably would have been really good if it wasn't for the excess salt.  It wasn't bad, but not as good as I think it would have been.  It also had a nice heat level (a bit spicy, but not too much; though I do like \"hotter\" than a lot of people).

All in all, it was OK.  Some definite positive notes, and the negative notes weren't fatal.  But they are a bit on the high-side of pricing.  My basket was $9 and the gumbo was another $6.  That's an expensive lunch.  I really can't give more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"Wanted a good chill place to eat for my birthday and found this best place. The drink 'Cranberry Mule' is now my new favorite drink. I ate the fried alligator and Cajun fries....Perfection!! Will definitely  be coming back to this place. If nothing else for the drinks."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite east valley spots. It is messy, tasty, seafood awesomeness. I love the shrimp and the soft-shell crab po boy. Warning, you will get dirty!!!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. We got a pound of the Crab, Mussles, and Crawfish. Unfortunately 6 mussels didn't open, which means they were dead before being cooked, they didn't offer to replace them. The crawfish were ok, but the Crab was very good. We went back the next night for more Crab.

Service was better the second night, mostly due to our waitress being new the first night.

We eat at similar restaurants in San Diego and they offer combination buckets, which we prefer. Here you can only order individual items by the pound. 

We would eat here again."}
{"text":"I would like to thank the bartender aly
My first time here was a not so good experience but aly went above and beyond to make sure my experience this time was excellent. The food was always delicious! Its the experience and the atmosphere people dine out for. I can honestly say this time made up for last time annnd that time has all been forgotten.....angry crab was incredible all thanks to aly!!!  thank you !!"}
{"text":"First of all, I really wish I could rate this place higher; our neighborhood really could use some good bbq and seafood. Here's our experience:
My wife & I were quickly seated, and our waitress quickly got to our table and explained how things work at the Angry Crab. At this point we're thinking we are in for a good meal. Drinks were served right away and we looked forward to the arrival of the food. This is where things went downhill. 

My meal arrived first. I ordered the brisket which was not good. It was mooshy and tasteless aside from the bbq sauce that was ladled onto the meat right before it arrived. The meat tasted like it may have been boiled before it was put into the smoker. If you want to taste the real thing head to south Phoenix and try Little Miss BBQ (it's a TEN). I did eat most of the brisket because I was hungry. I give it a 3 out of 10. Bummer.

After I completely finished my meal my wifes diner arrived. Timing not so good. 

She ordered battered shrimp. We expect deep fried anything to have some oil on it since it is submerged in the stuff until cooked. Problem here was that the fries tasted like shrimp, so we think it is all deep fried together. Also, the batter held onto too much of the grease. It left a heavy after taste. The corn that was served was COLD, not like it had become cold by sitting, but cold as if just taken out of the fridge cold (yuk!). 

I brought a pulled pork sanny home for  my daughter. I tasted the pork once home: same mooshy boiled flavor the brisket had. It was not something I would order again. Sorry guys.

The drinks were great and Rachel provided great service. I really want this place to work, so I am going to give it another try. I will order the crab and shrimp boil next time I go in. I hope it is good. I can tell they are trying, so the place has a chance since the owners and staff seem to be putting out effort. Sometimes all it takes is a little honest feedback and positive response for a restaurant to really make a splash."}
{"text":"Food was very very good !!!! $132 (my husband and I) for lunch was a bit much tho ... we ordered a lobster, king crab legs ( no where near the size of Fry's or Sam's Club) and shrimp  with a side of 6 potatoes, 2 corn, fried clams and bread  ... it was a lot of food but this was our first time so we just picked a few things..... Trifecta with medium heat ... heat was just right but I probably wouldn't order trifecta next time because the garlic was overpowering to me  but my husband loved it .... definitely recommend but expect a VERY VERY LARGE TAB !!!"}
{"text":"So glad there is a great seafood restaurant in the West valley! But this place is so good I'd drive across town anyway. Great food and great service. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Thos place is pretty good for seafood and probably one of the better ones in a land locked state. The trifecta sauce is what we always get and the juice over rice is phenomenal. I'd definitely recommend coming and trying this place out."}
{"text":"Don't eat there, I literally just left. The order was wrong, nobody bothered to care. The apps never came. It's nine at night , not even busy. Not the same without daniel. Sad experience."}
{"text":"Worst service. Was told after 20 mins that there was no shrimp and my order was already placed. Did not get my complete order with the mussels either. Another obvious clue was that i wrote on the paper \"refill please\" and he didnt even acknoledge. Then rec'd check, pen doesnt even work. This dude server Jeff throws the pen!! Wtf. That dude needs some customer service and how to accurately cummincate with his customers!! Smh."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices! Fun atmosphere and friendly help !  Lots of TVs to watch all your favorite sports."}
{"text":"Whaaaaooo if you love crawfish and BC, get the \"Trifecta\" flavoring comparable to BCs Whole Shabang I love! Super fresh, live crawfish in season here NOW!! Next best thing to my favorite cajun crawfish place and in Az?!! Say what?! Yeah get yourself down here! Wonderful Staff, very clean and added plus they have a washing double sink on the restaurant flour and provide a beer pale to throw out your shells and napkins. Something my favorite place didn't have and I no longer need to go to California to enjoy my awesome mudbugs!  See my photos of these Behemoth crawfish and NO I don't have toddler hands!!!! :)

I'll be back and I don't live anywhere around these parts. UYE in the making? Someone else take the reigns on that idea!  ;)"}
{"text":"The Obituary of Angry Crab, Indian School...

What was once one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona and I craved regularly has officially DIED. I am extremely disappointed that what was once lively, a fun place to visit with its energetic, wonderful staff, great food and atmosphere has now killed itself off.

It is with great regret to write such a poor review, yet this is my last time visiting this particular location. The service was non existent from the initial walk in and it felt dead and gloomy. We awaited on a greeting that took its time to come while it was not busy. We were seated and again waited an extended period of time to be greeted and what once was a normal friendly greeting appeared forced and the employees are not happy and seems as though this is a place of \"it's just a job\" and not what I enjoy doing...

Overall the wait time was ridiculous. We chose this place 2 hours prior to getting to a concert and although they were NOT busy whatsoever, we waited extensively especially to be served beverages and our meals.

One of us ordered the 2 meat BBQ special, it arrived and the pulled pork meatless with nothing but fat and the brisket DRY beyond belief and the meat was very dark as if it may have been in a dry lamp warmer for hours on end, no pull or juices from the meat and beyond well done.

Prior to my commitment of my favorite \"live\" crawfish, I always inquire of the size and if it's big, I'll commit. No puny mudbugs for me. I was assured they were big and the server indicated, \"as a matter of fact myself and the staff were just talking about how they are a good size finally\". So, that seemed like a reassured winner to me...I'll take it! However, when they FINALLY arrived to the table, they were just about non existent in size, I could not believe how small these things were as if they ought to throw em' back in to the swamp! This was shown to our server who he too expressed disappointment since on the ticket order he specifically requested large crawfish. I didn't bother eating them and was immediately removed from my order. I was then asked if I'd like to reorder or to order something else. I was reluctant since it took over a half hour to get this disappointing order. 

I declined on a reorder of the crawfish and instead ordered the ala carte fried catfish, although it was tasty-it was saturated in oil, which made it difficult to eat. I also ordered the favored trifecta sauce with light butter for my shrimp. Again, another disappointment, I am certain at this point the ingredients that were once used when A.C. opened at this location has since then changed along with newer ownership and has now gone corporate. The butter, is not butter and the sauce is of nuclear orange and the flavors not at all the famous trifecta sauce. 

The portion size, quality of the food, customer service and atmosphere is POOR.

I truly hope that my favorite location at 75th and Cactus hasn't changed like this, however I have noticed some things that have disappointed there as well. 

Please REDEEM YOURSELF Angry Crab. You had some LOYALTY customers here. Return of the original owners and employees! Make it fun, desirable and yummy again! Otherwise, PEACE OUT."}
{"text":"Lunch was fried catfish. One big piece that tasted good without a heavy breading. Fresh cut veggies (her words) did not disappoint. Need to come back for their signature seafood boils. Casual place, big with the white sheet on the table, for the crabs, which I also need to come back for."}
{"text":"Service was a bit scattered when we arrived. Ordered wine, received glass with a lipstick stain on it. Advised our server of this, and he told us that this was due to a new bartender. Umm, no. It's due to the glasses not being washed! Prior to our food arriving, a new server took over our table, and he was fantastic, and apologetic about our previous server. Honestly, the first guy wasn't that bad, but seem a bit overwhelmed by everything. The restaurant is pretty loud, but kudos to our 2nd server, and everyone else that was checking on our table. Food was good, so will likely be back."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre.... service was horrendous (sat with a empty cup of soda for about 20 minutes & never got my baked beans got my gumbo 15 minutes after my food was served..... first and last time going here. ?"}
{"text":"Went back a second time and the good is consistent. Had 3 lbs of snow crab, 1 lbs of clam, 4 sausage, potatoes, and corn. Trifecta sauce, medium. Delicious. There are clumps of seasoning here and there but it's an incredible messy fun experience."}
{"text":"I have been hearing about how amazing this place was for a while now at work and decided to check it out for myself. I am a big fan of crawfish broils, seafood, and bbq. They do have a big variety on their menu, and I am a huge fan of the fact they buy locally, and use their food waste for composting. When I got their I knew I wanted to try their crawfish. Unfortunately they were out. Then I knew I wanted their ribs, but unfortunately once again they were out. So I got a pound of their shrimp with their cajun seasoning, withe the lemon pepper and garlic seasoning as well. I scaled back on the spice or heat level. Then the waiter talked me into getting the snow crab with the same seasoning. Before my meal came out I ordered the gator bites (huge fan of gator). The gator bites were okay, so was the dipping sauce. There was some huge pieces, then there was some really small pieces, nothing really consistent. That caused some of the piece's to cook differently. So some of the pieces cooked really well, while some were dry, gator is really tricky to cook. The cajun seasoning was to my liking. Once my shrimp and crab  came out I was excited, but I had one problem. Something in the seasoning reall brought out that fishy smell. I'm pretty sure it was the garlic. But the smell was really over powering. As much as I love seafood that really overpowering fish smell can kill my appetite. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, and it was okay. What really blew my mind was the crab. The crab was amazing, the seasoning went perfect. I will definitely come back, hopefully when they have crawfish, and mix it up. Also the staff was really friendly, and jolly on the spot."}
{"text":"The food was ok.. Better 1st time we went... In Mesa. Jarod was the waiter..and he def. sucked.   Very short, never checked on us, forgot salt, never asked how food was, never refilled our drinks, dropped stuff off without a word, never once smiled , brought the last Mac n chz... As he stated... Why bring it? He did comp that, though. Why is he a waiter? We are usually huge tippers, maybe the way we look? I used to wait tables and you never know...so, don't judge a book by its cover...my bf works for tips well....the runner/busser James was amazing ...he acted like our waiter...smiled checked on us and saw to our needs...."}
{"text":"Omg great service!!! Amazing food the trifecta on the shrimp was delicious!! Get a side of the rice and seasoned fries and a cold beer and you are golden!!"}
{"text":"All the taps were pretty much broke. Every other beer was out. There was a cockroach by our table too."}
{"text":"Wish they weren't able to get my order in before they ran out of chicken.  Ended up with food poisoning.  Strike 3. I will not come back to this location"}
{"text":"I am so sorry to leave such a low score for this establishment, the employees are great.....the business is not somewhere I would ever visit again, I understand the rustic decor.....but this place is damn dirty......you don't have crab crackers available and the shrimp are filthy it is an insult to businesses that kinda have the same idea but clean. I have visited places similar to this in Riverside 
,CA and Chicago, IL and other locations and sorry to say...this is a bad case of ripping off a good concept and ruining it.

Is there a State food rating program in Arizona? A lot of these places are just Filthy????"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed. I've been to other locations and was always loved the food. I took my adult son out for dinner and ordered extra shrimp because I knew we would love it. I ordered 3 lb shrimp, 2 orders of sausage, cord and potatoes in mild sauce because \"they were out of number 2 so it was mild or Habinero hot. The food was tasteless and the shrimp were mushy. We left 1# of the shrimp uneaten. The hostess brought some more spice which helped a little with the flavor but I couldn't get past the soft, mushy, pasty shrimp. I did let them know and they mildly apologize and gave me a slight discount-still expensive dinner for two with a couple of beers over $70.00. I won't be back to this location and maybe I'll try the other locations If I can forgot what bad food this was!"}
{"text":"Had another great time at the Angry Crab Shack.  Tried the bags this time, Shrimp and Crawfish.  Much better that the fried, didn't know what I was missing.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsujkZ9t7aM"}
{"text":"Took my parents here for dinner and man it was so good! I was genuinely surprised at how fresh everything was since I am a supreme lover of seafood. Kinda irksome that no prices are really on the menu for the seafood but i guess thats the catch (pun intended) but id return. I loved the food here and would def return when I'm craving seafood again. The only thing I would say is that they don't always give you a warning about how the food is served in bags as a first time customer it would have been nice to know but very tasty and glad I went here."}
{"text":"This is in my neighborhood so I figured I had seen a bunch of friends posting pictures of crab legs and what not on instagram. So I thought me and the gf would check it out. 

So lets just say it was not what I expected. It was extremely busy about a 15 minute wait, this was around 9pm on a Friday night, I would almost suggest going later to miss the end of the happy hour crowd. They take your number and text you when your table was ready, but I never got the text, they just came out and called for me when our table was ready. I would highly suggest if your going to go on a weekend night to call and reserve so you don't have to wait. And this place is loud, you can barely hear the person across the table from you, I would not say it is a good place to bring kids, or for intimate conversations. Most of the crowd was couples and groups of young people eating dinner, very few families, and allot of the area hipsters hanging out at the bar. 

So my gf got the pulled pork Sammich and I got the alligator basket we both got gumbo. The gumbo was good, I know they use bay leaves in the cooking process but I wish that they would strain them out before serving it. I just don't like them. Nothing like biting into a big old bay leaf. But otherwise the gumbo was pretty good, served hot, but I would have preferred whole pieces of sausage and shrimp, it seems like the sausage was chopped up to small pieces and the shrimp was in pieces too, I never quite got a whole one. All in all it was very good and served piping hot, It comes in like a plastic Tupperware type serving dish so you can put a cap on it and take it to go if you want. 

My alligator was seasoned quite well, but it was a bit fried too long, which dried it out and it was a bit disappointing, when you fry alligator, they need to be more flash fried when cooking it, alligator is a white meat, and it doesn't hold moisture well so if you over fry it, it dries out quite a bit, that's what happened to mine anyhow. This place would of got 5 stars if it was not for that. Overall the the food was good, the Cajun fries were heavily seasoned, was not to big of fan of the potato salad, should maybe try the coleslaw next visit. 

The service was good, our server Cassie was very informative, and was sure to keep checking on us and made sure our beverages were kept full. I wish she would have offered to give us a marker I would have like to put some graffiti on the walls like most other people appeared to do. I am a fan will definitely come back soon for the crab or lobster. I suggest giving it a try."}
{"text":"The service and ambiance is fun and fantastic here but I didn't really care for my crab. I like a simply prepared steamed crab with a side of butter. I don't know what they put on it but it was orange. I had orange residue all over the place. Also, the butter isn't drawn so the fat separates and gets waxy leaving a very unappealing flavor. I'd go back to try some of the other menu items though."}
{"text":"Quality seafood from a local chain to Phoenix area. Prepare to get messy. Had the fried clams, 1 lbs shrimp and crab legs each. Trifecta sauce was great."}
{"text":"We've meant to try this place since we moved to the area from Utah.  It's a dead ringer for Bucket ó Crawfish in West Valley City, UT!  The sauces are awesome, and strangely even with lots of garlic, our hands didn't have that lingering smell for days like the Bucket.  No idea why.  When they say \"spicy\", take them seriously!  I got \"mild\"and it was what I would call \"hot\" - which I like anyway.  Great food, friendly service and the manager came around to chat as well.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Was very impressed with the oysters, very fresh. The food overall was very good and the atmosphere just makes for a great time. The best part was our server Kristin, so friendly, made us feel like the most important people there despite being busy. We will be back"}
{"text":"We have tried this restaurant three times.

Good news --- the service was good. The sweet potato fries were good. The spices were good.

Bad news --- the corn was mushy and over cooked

Really bad news --- The lobster, crab and crawfish were all over cooked. We have tried virtually all the selections. Worst sea food ever."}
{"text":"Wow, it seems like I eat out a lot. Most all of my reviews are for restaurants...

I go to the Angry Crab Shack a LOT. I grew up back east with this type of food, and this place is as good as any restaurant back there. I've had just about every item on their menu and enjoyed all. 

The wait staff, every one of them, acts like an owner. Everyone seems to actually care that you are having a good experience and everyone will help you even if they are not your actual server. 

If you like BIG King crab legs, or shrimp, or Bloody Mary's, and you know what real seafood is all about, you'll love this place. But get there early -- you could wait a looong time for a table. If you do have to wait, it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is like heaven. No joke. From the moment I tasted it to the time iam makomg the review (less than 2 weeks) i have ate here 4 times. Yes iam that addicted."}
{"text":"I've been to the Mesa location numerous times as I'm a huge fan! First time to the Phoenix location and loved it as well. They have a great happy hour before 6pm. I enjoyed the decor mostly at this location then the Mesa one. Awesome patio as well and bigger bar."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say. Busy, loud, and pricey. The place always seems to be packed though. Good for them. First restaurant business I've seen in this strip mall do well. (Sorry Rudy's, you guys rock!) I am not a sea food lover. Actually, I don't like it at all. The food here other than \"seafood\" is mediocre. For example, the chopped salad...not chopped at all. They took one of those plastic mixed greens boxes from Frys and dumped it in a bowl. If you're going to call it chopped, chop it. Visit a Subway. They will teach you how to do it. Best thing about this place is drawing on the paper tablecloth on the table with crayons. The Grandkids love it."}
{"text":"Spending a week in Arizona for spring training.  

The Angry crab is one of our favorite spots to visit when in Arizona. 

We are having the usual,king crab legs trifecta medium spice.  

The Cajun French fries are pipping hot and amazingly good.  

Today we are going to try the char grilled oysters."}
{"text":"NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.  I cannot understand how anyone could give the place more than 1 star.  No stars would be more appropriate.  Unacceptably loud, some obnoxious drunk screaming at the top of his lungs, wait staff rude and slow. Mostly booths and high tops, no comfortable seating.  Food; if you order fried, greasy and overcooked, boiled, tasteless and way overcooked.  

Not worth the effort to drive to.

Oh, and it stinks.  Smelly."}
{"text":"Waited for an hour and a half for a table.  Finally left and went somewhere else.

The people who were eating looked like they were enjoying it.  Can't fault them for being so busy.  4 stars because people who were leaving had huge smiles on their faces.

The staff was great to us while we waited.  Really wish I could have had some.  haha"}
{"text":"Well the food was definitely not bad, the atmosphere is not bad, the service is not bad, the experience is not bad. Nothing is bad.  However the bad is that there just was not something good.  Ok, so don't get me wrong, the lobster bag and crab bag I ordered tasted good for the most part, but as I was eating it out of its plastic bag laid out on the table I was thinking \"hmmm, this is not bad\". Then I looked around and the atmosphere was \"eh, not bad\".

So by all means give this place a try, you will not have a bad experience.  

Now on the topic of price.  It is definitely full priced crab and lobster.  Well, for this price... $100 plus tab for myself and wife I would rather spend approx the same and and be eating Lobster on a white table cloth with really good atmosphere and possibly even great service."}
{"text":"Love the food! I always order the shrimp in the trifecta sauce and it's great. Been coming here since it opened and it just sucks that the prices keep going up every time I come here. The soft shell crab is really good too! Just don't come on the weekend for dinner unless you're ready to wait an hour or two."}
{"text":"PUT YOUR BIB ON AND DIG IN!!!!!

I have passed this place many times driving to and from work and at one point lived about a mile away.  I always talked with my girlfriend about going there when we lived close and we never did.  We had some family in town this weekend and thought we should give it a shot.  All I can say is that I am glad I don't live a mile from this place anymore because I would eat here multiple times a week and be poor.  There were 9 of us and the place was pretty busy but they were able to seat us quickly.  Between all of us we ordered about 10 LBS of seafood and baskets of fries and onion rings.  The food came out very quickly and was DELICIOUS.  I personally had King Crab legs with the Trifecta sauce and 2 heat.  Pricing is good but it can add up fast so pay attention to what your ordering.  I will be visiting this place again and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious. My family and I can't get enough. I am so happy we finally have a seafood restaurant other than Red Lobster."}

Talks back to customer 
She sits customers of 7 with a toddler (same number as us) when they even came after us in line to be seated and the nerve to say bear with me your next it's bcoz u have a baby. The toddler and the baby were seated the same way so I don't know why she gave that excuse. 
Also she messed up a Togo order and after the customer left the restaurant she talks bad about that customer with other employees where customers can hear her, I was there standing and waiting to be seated so I can hear her blah blah blah, bad hostesses needs to be train customer service 101. Very unprofessional"}
{"text":"I only came in for a to go order but i heard nothing but good things about this location. The service was great and super attentive. We ordered the shrimp for a house party. As far as the shrimp that i ordered it wasn't what i expected. It was super messy and we had to tear off the shell and devein the shrimp. For the price i expect it to be at least deveined. Flavor was ehh, it seemed bland with the lemon pepper. Very greasy even though it wasn't fried.Maybe it was the sauce that made it slippery. Shrimp is my favorite but i don't know if i would order it from here again. Seemed like to much work."}
{"text":"Great HH and awesome catfish dinner for only $9! The king crab with the trifecta is my favorite. Remember to order bread for all the deliciousness!!"}
{"text":"Definitely not worth the money or wait. No tableware, cheap and flimsy napkins and waiters that do not know the sea food. Super loud and bar like. Wine choices all Sutter. Yuck and double gross. No thanks"}
{"text":"I recently went to Angry Crab Shack and loved it! I've been to Hot n' Juicy before in Vegas so when this place opened I couldn't wait to try it. We got there on a Friday night at about 7:15 and had about a 30 minute wait which we thought was fine since we weren't in any big hurry so we decided to get a drink at the bar while we waited. My boyfriend ordered a vodka tonic and I had one of the drinks on special Jack w/honey lemonade. The tonic was diet and they didn't say anything so it tasted off, it was also flat. They made him a different drink as it just didn't taste so good so he ordered a Jack and Coke. My drink was very sour. The lemonade needed way more sugar. One thing we noticed is they didn't like to use ice it seemed, within 5 minutes all of our ice was melted. 

When we sat down we looked at the menu and my boyfriend got a pound of the snow crab legs (2 clusters) in the traditional sauce with no spice and an extra ear of corn. I ordered 2 pounds of the crawfish in the trifecta sauce with low spice level and a potato. My boyfriend enjoyed his but it was way to spicy and he had ordered the no spice but it was pretty spicy still. I LOVED my sauce and spice level (which was suppose to be hotter than his but it wasn't). The crawfish were PERFECT. The size were double from other places I've had in the past. The owners were great to walk around and stop at each table, while we had to flag down our server a few times just to get basic items (a drink, tools to crack the crab legs). 

While service wasn't the best from our specific server and drinks from the bartender weren't great either the food was good. I will certainly be back for more seafood but will stick to the trifecta sauce and low spice level. While my boyfriend will probably stick to the other seafood dishes (salmon, catfish, etc)."}
{"text":"We recently visited this location for a friends birthday. We had a small group but got this private type room which was great! I had the muscles and the traditional sauce at a level 2 (still spicy) and a few potatoes added. It was a perfect amount as I left stuffed!!! My boyfriend got the brisket with a side of both sauces so he could try them. He ate every bite and so did I. We had a few rounds of drinks as well. I cannot say enough good things about the server as she was great (wish I would have gotten her name) and the food! I cannot wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"I stop in here for lunch during the week and food is always great I had the shrimp my first visit and mussels on my most recent visit. Service has been great both times! I know I will be back again soon for some bbq!"}
{"text":"We will start with the owners... They both take the time to talk with customers, make sure you are happy and really make you feel welcomed!

The staff here has always made us happy as well!

My wife LOVES the food here and it is one of her absolute favorites!

I am personally not as seafood crazy as her so luckily for me hey have other foods as well for me to choose from.

Prices are fair and food is good.

Definitely worth a taste!"}
{"text":"Hmmm....

Cool atmosphere with the open area with the customers writing all over the walls for memories... I definitely like the chandler location better... This location is super easy to never notice since you cannot see it from the road. 

This is a good place to go with groups.... 

We have been to a couple locations including this one several times and have met the owners who are friendly and nice... Donna really loves the shrimp and crab here in the spicy sauce in the bag.

Good catfish platter and fries! Good sausage and potatoes with corn in the bag of spicy too! The potatoes salad didn't have much flavor though, I hadn't tried it before and wouldn't do it again....

Maria was our server... not much for conversation or very friendly... We asked for more water and she filled one cup and left the others empty and only came back once until it was time to pay after we got the other guy server to get is more water."}
{"text":"service was the only thing lacking. food was delicious. not sure if greg just forgot about our table or what.  i ordered crab legs never got scissors or crackers until i had to ask someone else. refills took forever as well. Also i understand the whole being comfortable with your job, but calling a customer an asshole because he asked about frog legs is very unprofessional. especially to someone in the serving industry. overall come for the food not the service."}
{"text":"Sooo, my 4th visit to this reataurant.  I love the shrimp,  trifecta,  mild!!!!!  My ultimate favorite shrimp !  The Cajun fries are delish!!  They were out of cornbread, bummer. The place was hopping busy, 30 min wait time at 615pm.  I encourage everyone to try the lobster, soo good!! Since all seafood is priced per pound, be sure to get all prices and weights up front!! Headless shrimp is 3.00 extra per pound.  The alight or us in nugget firm, fried.  They now have a 6 pc, large size, fried shrimp basket.  It is picnic style with butcher paper on tables.  The atmosphere is fun.  They have a wide assortment of alcoholic beverages.   Enjoy."}
{"text":"Went here on 8-22-15 for the first time with my boyfriend for date night and sat at the bar and the service from Nikki and stephanie was wonderful and the food was messy but amazing. I had a blast and will defiantly be back. Thank you for a great first time experience."}
{"text":"I have been here one time and I got a sandwich along with the 2 lbs of vegetables. The thing to know about this place is you pick your food and then you pick how spicy you want it. I chose the level 4 spice which is named Ghost pepper or something like that. I like spicy food and can handle a high amount of heat , while I wont say it was too much for me I will say that I was amused at the predicament I had placed myself in. The veggies were great but the spice was pretty intense. 

My vegetables had a nice variety which included pineapples. You might thing that pineapples would help you with some of the heat but instead of help the pineapples were more like little bombs exploding spicy sauce all over my mouth. When I go again I am going to try the level 5! Angry Crab sure seemed to be alot better than the other crab shacks I have eaten at!"}
{"text":"I love the angry crab's food. I don't even bother to go the store to get crab or shrimp. It's worth to to have it prepared here in their trifecta sauce and eat myself into a food coma."}
{"text":"The blue crab, king crab legs and crawfish were awesome! Such a fun place and great food."}
{"text":"We went to the Angry Crab for the first time tonight and it was Excellent!!! The service was outstanding and super fast! The waiter JK was great and knowledgeable about the food, and the spice levels. The portions are a good size we had 2 dozen Snow crab legs, 1 dozen King crab legs, and 1 dozen Shrimp with potatoes, corn and Sausage all was soooo good (family of four)!!! I can't wait to go back and try the BBQ!!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. I have tried their BBQ and it's delicious, but my real true love is their seafood bags. I always switch it up, between snow crab, mussels and crawfish! I love that I can get those things whenever I want just by making a phone call, in which the service is always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I cannot even begin to explain my love for Angry Crab. When we first pulled up (our very first night), I can admit that I was slightly scared of the ambiance. However, my boyfriend (who is from the south) could not suppress his excitement for the food we were about to eat. The walls are covered in sharpie graffiti, LSU decorations adorn the walls, and butcher paper and no utensils are on the table. To say I was intimidated is an understatement. Jeff (the best server I have ever experienced at any restaurant ever) calmed our fears quickly. With his outgoing personality, customer service orientation, and thoughtful explanation and recommendation, Jeff helped us to order our food. The food is beyond amazing. It is so beyond worth the price. My boyfriend loves that they have live crawfish to boil! 

We continually come back to Angry Crab for date night. Our favorite nights are even when Jeff is our server! If it hadn't been for him that first night, we never would have come back for our 5+ time. I tell everyone about Angry Crab (and my experience with Jeff)! My parents even celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary here on my recommendation! 

Thanks Jeff and Angry Crab for helping Daulton and I find a restaurant that reminds him of home and tastes so good!"}
{"text":"Went with daughter and mother in law, girls night out. The shrimp, mussels and snow crab was great. The trifecta and level 2 spice was just right
Will definitely go back for date night. 
Don't wear your Sunday best unless you have a great dry cleaner, I really got into the meal. Finger licking good 
Steph was a great waitress"}
{"text":"Service was good. Food not the best quaity."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Our waitress, Maria, was super friendly and very helpful. Would definitely visit again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The feel of this place is like a Joe's Crab Shack. Very casual, like being on a sail boat of wood. You can also catch the game on tv. 
You are seated at a table that has a long sheet of paper covering, warning you of the mess you're about to partake in. 
As a note, towards the back of the restaurant, there's some water tanks that hold crabs in one, and lobster in the other. Freshest of fresh food!
For starts, we got a shrimp plate - our came with fries which were super tasty, and great with the Cajun mayo. The shrimp were good too.
It's fun to check out the menu. They offer different shell fish - blue crab, Dungeness Crab, snow crab, king crab legs, shrimp, and their famous crawfish. You then get to select your seasoning which there's about 7-8 you can choose from, next select your spice level, and lastly, you can add in sausage, corn, potatoes, or veggies. I opted for the snow crab, trifecta seasoning at mild and added sausage. I was afraid this was going to be really spicy, which I can't tolerate right now... and this was a perfect combination.  It had just the slightest kick and very flavorful. A pound really filled me up and I couldn't even touch the sausage. 
My husband got the pick 2 meats with ribs and pulled pork. We were impressed with the amount of food that came with and it was very good. 
Overall, we loved it and will definitely return. I just wish they had a combo bag that you could get crawfish, shrimp, and crab legs."}
{"text":"WOW!  Had the King Crab bag with the three spices, medium heat and it was awesome.  The Hush Puppies were great too.  This place gets a big ole BOOYAH!!!"}
{"text":"Loved it here first time and definetly will be coming back... servers were super nice and helpful and the food amazing"}
{"text":"We tried the Phoenix location for my daughters 18th Birthday dinner and were excited for an Angry Crab to open up in our Litchfield backyard.  Our waiter, Caleb, was awesome.  Pound of shrimp and catfish pretty good, but my wife made the mistake of ordering the chicken strips.  WTF?  They battered my catfish to near perfection, but decided they couldn't manage to batter a chicken tender!!  Obviously frozen.  Terrible.  Caleb tried to get the chicken taken off the bill, but the manager apparently thought we were just full of shit, I guess.  We will probably come back for lack of options for good shrimp and crab around these parts.  But we now know that seafood is he only menu items they care to do right."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years but this will be my last time! The WORST customer service ever! Our waiter, Nick took our order and never came back. We had other servers bring us what we needed. When the bill came, we had 7 people, there was 3 separate checks. Nick showed back up and one of the checks was incorrect. He decided to argue with us about it , we asked for the manager and he was absolutely rude as hell!! The absolute worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant! This place is not cheap and to treat paying customers like that, no thank you!"}
{"text":"I use to love this restaurant. The last 2 times I tried I was very disappointed. Monday went for dinner. Wanted shrimp with out heads on them. Said they were all out could only order it with heads. Then asked to order red snapper. Said we do not carry that anymore. If you want grilled fish they do not offer any. So we ordered the fried shrimp I asked if I could substitute something for Cajun fries. The waiter said sure onion rings, So I ordered the onion rings and when we got the bill there was an extra charge for onion rings. Never was told there would be extra charge. The shrimp was average. Won't go back again."}
{"text":"my wife has been raving about this place so we drove from our enclave here in scottsdale. 

it reminds me of some crab shacks i use to eat at around coastal georgia, except with a bit more clothed customers. we did have to wait about 30 minutes for a table. 
so you basically order by the pound of whatever seafood you desire...mussels, clams, lobster, blue crab, dungeness crab, king/snow crab, etc. They steam it, dump it in a bag with a sauce of your desire, and with a hotness of your desire. you can \"add on\" in the bag corn, sausage or potatoes for extra money. they bring it to your butcher paper covered table and you go at it! hands digging and clawing to all the tasty goodness. 
they have french fries, wings, and even dessert. prices for the cheapest, shrimp, are 8 bucks/pd, up to 15-20 bucks/pd for the crab. consider that the unedible parts of the crab/shrimp/crawfish/etc are part of the \"pound\" so unless you're not very hungry, you will probably have to order more than one pound (or else fill up on french fries). 
there are alcoholic options for imbibing. our server tonight seemed a bit over stretched with customers, and i left feeling hungry after a pound of clams. the food was tasty though, and it was packed with customers. one thing i feel totally weird about overall though?....yes, this is a \"beach themed\" restaurant, but it is totally not appropriate for hairy chested old men to be eating here with their tommy bahama shirts full unbuttoned! panama city beach and key west are the only places in the USA where that should be tolerated.....

overall though, good food and friendly service."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place. Note my use of caps, cuz I loved it. Our server was completely amusing and very helpful. Since this was our first time, she walked us through the ordering process. Being first timers, I greatly appreciated it. 

We started the meal off with a half dozen raw oysters...yum, yum, yum. I was with two others, so we split them evenly unfortunately. For the main meal, one individual ordered the shrimp po boy. My other dining companion and I shared a clam and crawfish boil with corn and potatoes added on. 

The boils were ah-mazing! We got the traditional boil sauce spiced to a 2/5. Now, mind you, I'm known to have a pretty smokin' hot palate, but I didn't want to smoke out my companion I was sharing with, so we went for a 2. It was perfect for me, much hotter than I thought it would be. My companion loved it, as well, but had to mix in a bit more beer to help with the heat. 

Halfway through our cracking and eating, the general manager approached us and let us know we had been served mussels instead of clams...oops. They dropped in some clams for us at that point. I have to say, I may have preferred the mussels, but it was all amazing. 

After cracking and eating for an hour, I wasn't up to trying the po boy, but I have it on good authority it was, \"Good.\""}
{"text":"Ordered to go again a few weeks ago, and sent my husband to get the food. He said everything was normal."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Not only is crab one of my favorite things to eat, I love the variety of flavors to choose and spice level. I also love that you get your own bag. Really fun. I always get the snow crab with sausage and the legs are HUGE. Not your typical snow crab. The veggies are also a great addition. Real veggies, not just corn and potatoes. 
We have the crocodile bites and they were good- tasted like chicken . 
Very fun atmosphere but it can be loud and they don't take reservations so be prepared to wait. Have a few drinks and enjoy the fun. The waitstaff is really fun!"}
{"text":"I just went here with a friend last night after rave reviews from other friends (ample free parking, not $2.00/hr like Mill Ave)...AMAZING!  We started with charred oysters, oysters on a half shell, lightly grilled with cheese and spices on them, and they were out of this world!  The Calamari strips were unusually shaped like cheese sticks, but were delicious!  My friend had a pound of the shrimp, which was too much for one person to eat, and they were GIANT!  They heads were easily pulled off (or you can order them already beheaded) and they were easy to peel.  I had a pound of the snow crab (I could have eaten two pounds of that!).  The Trifecta seasoning is indeed the way to go and at medium heat (hot really is hot).  Our server Zoe was ON IT the entire time, from start to the extra to-go order to the check.  The flavor of the seasonings is SO GOOD you'll want to hug your server (I did)!  Sorry,  Joe's, There's a new King (crab) Of The Hill!

P.S. I totally forgot to mention the $2 deserts.  We had chocolate cake and red velvet cake to go, and they were BIG pieces and excellent!  How do they do that for $2!?"}
{"text":"This is not only my favorite place, but all of my buddies too.  The shrimp and snow crab are the favorites - great tasting fresh seafood here in the desert.

It's a cool atmosphere but don't expect silver service here.  The food is served piping hot in plastic bags which you rip open and start peeling the shrimp or cracking those shells.

Add corn, potato or sausage to your bag for a minimal charge. 

Expect messy fingers but don't worry - bibs are provided and there is a great wash up area to clean the sauce off your hands.  I think they do have gloves too on request.

I recommend trifecta sauce #2 but ask for a side of #3 to dip and increase the heat - awesome.

Try the Phoenix location for BBQ - again sold by the pound and truly amazing - the brisket is melt in the mouth.

 Enjoy"}
{"text":"This place is so fun to eat at. Eating with your hands and making a huge mess is definitely the way to go. 

I ordered the king crab (1 lb) with medium trifecta sauce with potatoes and corn. It was delicious and the flavors were on point. The potato is small, so if you want, order a few. They also give you a rock and scissors to help get the meat out of the shell.

I highly suggest the trifecta sauce. I think the medium spice level wasn't too hot but still super flavorful. The mild wasn't as flavorful in my opinion. But regardless, I would eat anything with that sauce. 

Overall, it's a place for good company and great food. I will be back for more.

Also for you Pokemon masters, there's a gym here!"}
{"text":"I came here on the recommendation of a trainer at LA Fitness up the street. I had a pound of snow crab legs in medium trifecta sauce. They were so delicious, I was scooping the sauce out with my fingers to eat even after I finished the crab legs! My only complaint is the forks. They brought out cheap plastic forks when I asked, as opposed to the tiny forks made for eating crab and lobster. They did have crackers, scissors, bibs and plastic gloves, which I appreciated, though next time I will make sure to bring my own forks from home."}
{"text":"I had friends over for the holiday weekend. Rather than drive after a long day, we ordered a large amount for pick-up. 
The king crab and shrimp were a tad overcooked however the flavor made up for that. The corn and potatoes were perfectly cooked and again alive with flavor. 
The alligator was good, would be better sautéed. 
The frog legs were just so-so and again would be better sautéed. I don't think they were eaten. 
The husband and kids loved the fish and chips as well as the chicken tenders kids meals. 
The hush puppies were full of flavor and crisp. They were full of jalapeño flavor. Wow. 
The shrimp were huge and the heads were intact. Fantastic. 
Medium was hot enough that my chin burned an hour after eating. Perfect. Not too much. Mind you, I like spicy so tread carefully. Medium is HOT. 
Our order was ready promptly and no mistakes made by staff.  The employee who took the order was friendly and accurately relayed the very long, detailed and intricate order with precision and a great attitude. 
We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place, awesome seafood, great beers. Service is good and friendly. The trifecta spice is amazing. Worth the wait when the lines are long. Great kids meal menus as well."}
{"text":"I'm surprised how fresh the seafood is and how spicy they can get it! Just get a pound of shrimp at spicy level 2 or 3 and you're ready to go! Oh, also Cajun fries... Nom. If you are brave, I would suggest ordering spicier sauces on the side just to dip and try. But be warned they are hot! 4 was pretty intense."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Its a little pricy but is definitely worth every penny!"}
{"text":"The sauce is extremely oily making anything we order very bland, even asked for an extra side of sauce and it's literally 90% oil 

Besides that everything else was good, amazing service and reasonably priced"}
{"text":"Sooooo good.  As everyone has said the trifecta sauce is delicious. My husband tried four heat level and is ready for five but he likes things really hot. I did medium which was a 2.  He got the snow crab and I got the king crab and We actually both like the snow better. A couple of decent beers to choose from, the moon juice is good from Santan brewery. It's a mess but there are Sinks to wash your hands right in the dining area. I would probably skip the potatoes and corn next time And have more crab legs. I would probably like to try the shrimp sometime since everybody says it's really good too but without the head.  We will definitely go back that maybe bring more people so we can try a bigger variety of things."}
{"text":"Sadly, the sauce was terrible last time I went. I don't know what happened to their quality control. I take clients there regularly. This location is SO NOISY and constant whistles and sirens is annoying. I will not go to this location again. Also, the location on Alma School has better sauce and better service as well as atmosphere."}
{"text":"Don't go to this one. You're better off going to hot'n'juicy. POOR QUALITY CONTROL at this one. I started going to Phx location after 3 times of terrible sauce. I even emailed the company last year and NO Response. The sauce I had (aways trifecta medium) on friday 6/24 was INEDIBLE. Absolutely terrible. I used to to here at least once a month."}
{"text":"Best crab I have ever eaten!! Service was excellent! It's in my top 5 restaurants! I had the snow crab with garlic and hot. Usually when I order hot wings they are not hot enough, this was to hot. Next time I would order medium. They literally bring you a bag of food. Wear the gloves!!"}
{"text":"Adrian was an amazing waiter if we go back we will be requesting him. A runner gave us the wrong food and he quickly fixed it. The wait for food was a little long but the quality was excellent!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Terrible concept. Terrible food. Terrible service. I will never go there again. I don't think they'll be open very long."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday at 7ish. You kind of see the wait coming when you pull in and it's on par on what to expect with seafood places like this (Boiling Crab). We waited a little over an hour. 

It was very disappointing because they were out of like 5 menu items already at 7. Crawfish, lobster, etc. Prices were ok, maybe understandable since we're in AZ and all. 

Now the seafood itself was less than ok. We had mussels, oysters and king crab. King crab was good. A bit mushy and had soft shells that might yield the cracker unnecessary. Mussels were good. Simple. They were mostly small to decent size.

Oysters were.. wow. Incredibly small. When I was scooping them out, a friend thought they were clams. We got them charred. They came in looking really appetizing on big shells covered with some mixture that looked it had cheese and hot pepper flakes. The menu just says \"char\" so I don't know what is on it and after eating it, I still don't know what it is. They were served along grilled pieces of bread. Some were blackened. I don't get it. The oysters itself (after digging through the mixture) are the size of a fingertip. The topping is WEIRD. I think it's garlicky? It's too salty and bitter tasting to be cheese. We would spread some on the bread to balance it out but... WHAT IS IT?

Now. The sauce itself. The sauce that you pick and all the seafood is coated in. We went with the trifecta because the reviews raved about it. And we liked it at our other seafood establishments. We picked 3 on spicy scale and it ended up being too spicy for me but that's my fault and I can deal.

The sauce itself has an inordinate amount of grease. When we got our bags of seafood, we waited for the rest so everyone could dig in at the same time. While waiting, large pools of grease has formed and continued to spread on our table. The sauce itself isn't very flavorful. I used to like to occasionally dip the food in it but I found myself (everyone at our table did) using a lime/pepper+salt mixture to wash it off.

The sauce is the only comparison to Boiling Crab I will make. The seafood I won't compare because that varies, right? The sauce I will compare. At BC, I will dip in the sauce and lick it off my fingers. I can't do that here. The sauce is greasy and just slicks off. You have weird starchy residue on your hands. 

Our friend got the blue crab and shrimp. They are a little iffy on the lb of shrimp they got because they never saw a smaller amount before but we will trust Angry Crab on this.. because there's not much else we can do. Blue crab was small.

Our server was ok. Service was fast overall except we waited till the END OF TIME to get some fries. Some mishaps on pricing (heard the wrong order) and you're going to have to flag them down because it is BUSY and they are racing everywhere."}
{"text":"Tonight the shrimp was over done and the waitress did not care. She was having a grand time with the table next to us that had a single guy but never even checked to see how we were doing. We sent one shrimp back and she never bothered to see how the next batch came out! It sucked also under any circumstance do not get the Michelle with 2 l's she is HORRIBLE!!!! Michele with 1 L is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"So recently they have changed the way they make their sauce. It's so much more diluted than it used to be.  The flavor just isn't there anymore. I thought it was just me at first, but another friend of mine confirmed that it's a lot more runny than it used to be.  Not coming back unless it's changed back."}
{"text":"I've been to 3 different locations, but have enjoyed this one the best!!
Amanda, or Amana as the staff refers to uer, was an awesome server. We shared some cool stories. She was so pleasant as well as attentive to our needs.  Had some great conversation with Dawn, one of the managers as well. Very cordial to us. We had a few laughs with her as well. 
The food was fantastic.  Started out with the fried oysters which I'm not usually a fan of but theses were very tasty. We also enjoyed the gator bites.  For our entire, we did the snow crab and shrimp.  Both quite good, but next time I'm going to do a double order of snow crab. We even tried for the first time the bourbon pecan pie which was large enough to share. It wasn't too sweet as many pecan pies are. Very good. 
I highly recommend the Angry Crab and BBQ.  One of my favorite places."}
{"text":"If you like a restaurant with no plates, or silverware, and food that is slopped in front of you on a pan or bucket, this is your spot.
The BBQ ribs were dismal, the brisket was so fatty it was almost inedible.
The only reason I give this hole 2 stars is the lobster was good. (Can't screw that up right)??
Alas the only working utensil was a rock to smash open the shells. Horrific!!
And God forbid they'd take/bus the shells or bones off the table! The waitress said throw'm back in the buckets and leave it..
Disgusting.
I don't know how these places stay in biz!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. We went with a large group and had a great time. There were 9 of us and, between all of us, we tried raw oysters, gator bites, hush puppies, frog legs, lobster, dungeness crab, clams, shrimp, king crab, and crawfish in varying degrees of seasoning and spice. All of the seafood was super fresh. I had the king crab and it was awesome. Usually the crab meat at the very top of king crab is kind of icky and greenish but this crab was incredibly good. No green skank only tasty, tasty crab! I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever visiting this establishment I just moved to AZ, my boyfriend and I are originally from LA, we picked this location before he headed back to LA, I spent about $200 here the other night.

I ordered 2 pounds King Crab, a fried shrimp basket, 1 pound of mussels, and a lobster just under 2 pounds also extras & sides, what brought the biggest disappointment to me was I ordered 2 pounds of shrimp and every single shrimp wasn't deveined, I'll assume because you have to take the shell off yourself but that's still no excuse, I found that utterly grotesque and felt I wasted a lot of my $ because I paid for shrimp that was filled with feces!!! I brought the 2 pounds back to my house and noticed after the fact, every single piece has poop in it!!

If you ever decide to go here and get the shrimp, just don't, avoid at all costs, I'm highly upset that I can't eat my shrimp and that I'll have to literally throw out 2 pounds of it!!! I do not recommend this place especially coming from LA we have similar establishments called the \"Boiling Crab\" and \"Hot N Juicy crawfish\" I've never been so disgusted. 

Other than that everything else was pretty good, and our waitress was nice."}
{"text":"YUMMY!!! I love coming here! The atmosphere is great. Every time we have been here, the service has been up to par. They have all the sports games playing on TV's all around the restaurant. We once asked them to change it to a game we wanted to watch and they did. I always order the shrimp with medium spice and it's perfect. Warning though! If you like to eat spicy food but it not be too hot to where you can't eat it comfortably, then medium spice is good enough. They serve you the food in a bag which was surprising the 1st time you go but after you enjoy the food and return, you wont think about it at all. I like going to this location even though it's a bit far for us because they mix the spices the best out of the 3 different locations I have been to so far. If it's your first time trying Angry Crab,  I definitely recommend you try this location first. It's also great for a group date since they serve BBQ as well. In the event someone doesn't do sea food, your friends will always have the option to eat anything on the BBQ menu side, which I heard is also good but I have yet to try. This is truly on of my favorite places to eat. I definitely recommend to anyone wanting to try it."}
{"text":"this place was great, i got the crawfish and they were flavorful and huge.. this place is way better than joes crab shack taste and price wise.. and there are a lot of hot waitresses.."}
{"text":"Yesterday April 9th, 2018 my wife, sister and I had the most awful experience. There is no leadership, our server John didn't care about checking on any of his tables, we sat without refills, gloves, salt or lemon for a very long time. The manager claimed to be new to the location and he thought cracking jokes could fix everything. I won't ever be back they lost customers forever."}
{"text":"Let's talk crawfish. This place nails it. I mean off the freaking hook nails it. I was in the Phoenix area for the week on business and drove past the Angry Crab several nights in a row and it had a line out the door. My assistant and I went by on Monday night and saw no line and so we went in and I'm so glad we did. The staff was very friendly and a lot of fun (shout out to Kat). The raw oysters were good (not the best I've ever had but they definitely did not suck), the crawfish was amazing, and the crab was delicious. And, just because it was funny, the manager brought me my PBR in a paper bag. Oh, yeah, and our dinner utensil was a rock. I will go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"LOVE this place, they have great seafood and the energy of a Farrell's Ice Cream Parlour. They have a wide variety of crustaceans and sides, if you're not into seafood they also have great BBQ. The prices are not bad but you usually can't get King Crab many places cheaper. Go at lunch for no wait, dinner time has 1 to 2 hour waits."}
{"text":"I was visiting Phoenix with my boyfriend, and it was our last night in town.  We had an early flight to catch, so we stayed not far from the airport.  I ended up finding this place on Yelp because it was close to our hotel.  I didn't know what to expect because we had never had seafood boil together before.  I thought the restaurant was a bit hard to find because it was tucked away in a shopping area, but maybe it was also because we are from out of town.  On the inside, the restaurant is spacious with high ceilings and a very causal feel.  There's also outdoor seating, but it was about 8:00 PM in November and too cold to sit outside.  After we sat down our waitress came and greeted us and explained how to order and how the food is cooked.  We ordered crab legs and shrimp and added two cobs of corn.  After placing our order, the food came quickly and smelled great!  The seafood was delicious, especially with the sauce.  The restaurant provides you with tools for eating the shellfish, but be ready to get messy.  You also get a bucket for discarding the shells.  The only thing I didn't like about the meal was the fact that the corn on the cob was completely overcooked and soggy.  That wasn't a big deal because obviously the corn is not the highlight of the meal.  I would recommend ordering the corn and just asking the restaurant not to steam it in the bag with your seafood, but instead, add it after everything has been steamed.  After finishing your meal, there are conveniently located sinks around the restaurant for you to wash your hands.  We got to the restaurant late, so we were here past close, and the restaurant staff were very polite about it.  At no point did we feel like we were being rushed out of the restaurant.  In fact, the restaurant was still serving another couple who got there even later than us!  Great food, great customer service, definitely recommend this place for a fun, delicious, and unique experience!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at the Alma School location since it's opened and was so excited when I found out there was one closer to home (the BBQ was a plus). In my bag of mussels, that I ordered because they were out of clams (wah), the trifecta was super watery and not like I was used to but it was made up when our King Crab came out in the perfect trifecta mixture that I know oh-so-well. My Dad and brother were pretty pleased with the brisket and ribs, too. Because the place is pretty new, I expected some hiccups in service or some inconsistencies in the food but I was very impressed! Excited to come back! Hoping they'll have clams next time."}
{"text":"The seafood here was not fresh, growing up on an island and coast I know what is fresh. 
The king crab people are so raving about, I laughed at the ignorance, *hint* just go to Costco and open your eyes. King crab here is like a 'jester' than a 'king'

Then the place wasn't exactly a great place to walk around, everywhere I walked on and touched it was sticky, it was gross. 

Oh and attitude of the girl at the entrance, oh wow! what is wrong with her. Anyway I heard there is another hot and juicy place which I think I will give it a try."}
{"text":"Rather than going out like planned, we decided to go eat Cajun seafood at 9:30 at night. 

It was one of our better decisions. 

Our waitress was friendly, the shrimp cooked to perfection, and the sausage, well the sausage was unremarkable but it was a nice compliment to the shrimp. Even the spiciness was tolerable, I had a 4 and even my pansy palate could handle it. 

I haven't been to a seafood place like this since I lived in California so it was a great way to feel at home."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for the first time last Saturday January 10.  Kind of knew what to expect based on reviews we read.  I had the soft shell crab basket - the crab was delicious, nice coating. The French fries were good as well.  Could have done without the cole slaw though which had absolutely no flavor to the point where I thought maybe we got some before anyone dressed it??  My husband had the crab with the trifecta spice and loved it.  As others have said, the food is spicy -- both my husband and I love spicy and he ordered mild and it was plenty of spice.  The service was attentive and we were never left with empty glasses.  The manager or owner perhaps that evening was very friendly and explained the menu and came back to check to be sure everything was to our liking.  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Shelby was awesome! She introduced us to the s&p & lime mix on the side for our shrimp which was so yummy! She definitely made it an awesome experience. Can't wait to go back. 

The shrimp with pacific rim, potatoes and sausage is legit,especially with frog legs ...yum!"}
{"text":"Holy Smokes!!! The only bad thing about my experience at Angry Crab Shack was leaving the place!! From the moment we walked in we were greeted by two friendly hostesses, taken to a great table and our server, Alicia, was there immediately! Everyone is ridiculously friendly, helpful and accommodating! And the food is simply off the charts! Try everything!!! We had crab legs, brisket, ribs and catfish! You'd think either the fish or the meat would be superior, but not the case -- everything is AWESOME!! I couldn't even talk (one of my favorite things in the world) as our meal was too intoxicating! You'd be doing yourself and your stomach a disservice if you don't try this joint your first possible opportunity! A good looking staff, great food, exceptional energy and you get to wear a bib as an adult! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went back to Angry Crab with some friends on a Friday night around 630 to find a line out the door ... definitely a better sign than during my first visit.

Took about 30 minutes to get a table, and knowing they were packed, quickly ordered 2 lbs of shrimp, 2 lbs of mussels and 2 lbs of crawfish with some sausage, corn and potatoes.

Seems they've gotten the hang of the boil.  This time there wasn't a massive amount of oil to ooze uncontrollably out of the bags and they've bumped up the seasoning as well.

Also got a basket of fries and onion rings which were exceptionally good and fresh.

Only problems were my wife's beer was flat and some of the mussels didn't open.  One of my dining partners pointed out the unopened mussels and asked for replacements.  The server explained that it was OK to eat the unopened ones because \"they were processed and then put in the freezer\".

OK, I grew up working in my family's fish markets.  While it may be possible that the unopened mussels did indeed die in the freezer and haven't had a chance to go south; there is no way to know whether it wasn't dead before it hit the freezer.  There is no way I would ever, ever eat a mussel that didn't open and I can't imagine any management ever suggesting their patrons eat one either.  Not worth the risk.  And why put mussels in a freezer anyway?

After explaining why there was no way we were eating those, the manager quickly comped us an extra pound, which I thought was way above the call of duty (I know that there will almost ALWAYS be bad mussels in a batch and was fine with it while my dining partners wasn't as understanding).

All in all a great experience and obviously the word is out ... there was still a sizable line to get in as we left ..."}
{"text":"Satisfied with what I purchase and ate.  I ate exactly what I paid for and very happy when everything was said and done."}
{"text":"My husband loves this place. He ordered the lobster and had them crack it. Said it was the best lobster he has ever had. Trifecta, hot with sausage and corn, it makes a pretty hefty bill. I, on the other hand, and not a huge fan. There was one server, she had no interest in her job. Shrimp was super chewy, due to it being boiled. 1/2 lb portions would be great so I could get more then one protein. When I got my bag, it was torn and leaked all over the table and my jeans when she layed it down. Yikes!!! Fries are crazy good..... calamari is probably the best I have found! Overall is a good choice, but expect to have to pay a ton."}
{"text":"Everything was great! We were a little bummed about being told there was a 45min-1hr wait, but I think it bummed out a lot of people ahead of us so we were actually quickly seated.  Started with Cajun fries. We ordered a pound of crawfish, a pound of shrimp and a pound of crab legs.  It all cost 48.00  Very messy, very spicy, and we left very full.  I can't wait to go back and try the fried shrimp po boy."}
{"text":"Food was delicious hubby and I both had pound of shrimp with sausage, corn and red potatoes. The waitress was some what attentive she explained the items for being our first time, but when we asked for bread or napkins she kept forgetting to bring us the items. She did state she was having a bad day. No excuse but will be coming back food and flavor was great."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious high quality food AND amazing price!
This was our first time dining at Angry Crab and the menu prices were so good, we tried a variety of things you can't really get anywhere else in town.
For an app we had the fried frog legs (score one item OFF the lifetime bucket list!) The frog legs were almost exactly like fried chicken wings but long ;D

For the main course we had the head on shrimp with trifecta sauce and \"1\" hot, and the crawfish with trifecta sauce and a \"2\". The 1 was savory and pleasant, not spicy at all. The 2 was just over the threshhold, and I would recommend it as a starting point if you think you like spicy food, and 1 if you don't. 

This is served \"backyard\" style. If you get the boil bag seafood you're going to be shelling and eating with your hands and using lots of napkins. If you're maybe a little squeamish you might want to go with one of the baskets or sandwiches instead. 
The shrimp had a lot of meat and were really easy to eat. I was a little anxious about it being served with the head on, but the \"creepy googly eyes and legs\" bits slide right off. The crawfish had more shell per weight than the shrimp, but crawfish as a meat tastes amazing. If you've never had crawfish before this is a great place to have it the first time. 
We got an add in of sausage with the shrimp and vegetables with the crawfish. Veggies are cool, but the sausage really added to the dish more. Would add potatoes AND sausage next time. 

We went all out on the meal (drinks, dessert, add ins etc.) and it only came out to about 65$ for two. We could have easily had a nice date night dinner under the 50$ price point. 
Would recommend to anyone. Will probably go back next week :D"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Having lived in Florida for awhile, the decor here reminds of a sea side shack back home. The sea food is so fresh, the crawfish in that medium Cajun hot sauce is to die for!! And they have PBRs for 2 bucks. Perfect summer afternoon lunch with FIFA playing in the background :) i only deleted one star for the erratic service. The waitress was super nice but kept getting our order wrong."}
{"text":"Very expensive and not much seasoning on the food. Not sure I am a big fan of eating with my fingers and food dropped in a pile in the center of the table."}
{"text":"By far the best option for seafood in the Westside. Before you order be advised that when they mean hot it is insanely hot. I've eaten Mexican food my whole life, so believe me when I tell you their hot is freaking hot. Don't try to act tough and ruin your meal. Tried most of the items on the menu except for frog legs. Yeah not gonna happen. The only thing I would like to see change is the food being served in a bucket or something similar, eating out of a bag is not feasible. Also keep in mind this place is a little pricey so don't bring everyone; specially if they're ordering lobsters and snow crabs."}
{"text":"It's nice that Phoenix now has a seafood place similar to the Boiling Crab.. 
It's about time! The place is big with lots of tables. I like that they have the graffiti walls that customers can draw on and leave there mark on. We went on a Wednesday night so it wasn't busy and there was no wait. Our server was really nice and he explained how everything worked since it was out first visit. My boyfriend and I got a pound of the Trifecta shrimp, Lemon pepper snow crab legs and a side of Cajun fries. I liked how crispy the fries were but I wish they put more Cajun seasoning on it because I couldn't really taste the seasoning. The shrimp and crab legs were delicious. Good sized shrimp and crab legs. The seasoning is a bit different then the boiling crab. The Trifecta seasoning was a mixture of Cajun, lemon pepper and garlic sauce and I would increase the spice level. We got medium and it had a little kick but not spicy at all. I also read from reviews that the catfish was amazing and our server highly recommended it so I would like to come back and try that.
Overall we enjoyed this place. The food and service was good and we'll defiantly come back again. The only thing I would like is for them to replace the napkins with paper towels and provide wet naps next time."}
{"text":"First Time here & its  he best time ever and the best crab I ate (my opinion) our server (Brittney)  was awesome & gave great service!"}
{"text":"Service is good with occasional awkward waiter. The food is good, but the prices? Not worth it. You get a pound of King crab legs for $21? That's 3 crab legs. Both my sister and I spent nearly $60 and were not satisfied. I would not recommend it if you don't have the money. However, if you're willing to splurge it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Love the food.  Can't be said any simpler than that.  Happy to see one has been brought to the west valley.  Wish they took orders over the phone for quick and easy pickup."}
{"text":"Pretty darn tasty! It was a little different the way yhe food is served. They just hand it to you in a bag, with a rock. ( I assumed it was for the crab and went for it.) We did the trifecta sauce and it was plenty spucy for us."}
{"text":"I really liked this place, my husband not so much.  But then again he doesn't like food that requires a sink out in the dining room.  It is a very casual, fun place however.  Different than anything you've probably experienced with food brought to you in a bag and eaten with your fingers on your table.  However, the taste is GREAT and the service was great as well."}
{"text":"If you don't want to cook crab, I do mean king crab in the rest what they have on the menu, I highly suggest this place!

Mike the waiter was very helpful, not pushy!, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We got here and it looked slow so we figured we would get served right away. There was only one lady serving and so the bartender was helping out a lot. They were super understaffed. The bartender was really nice but he did mess up my uncles order and forgot about my water and my cousins steamed rice. The thing that bothered me the most was that all my family got their food before me and i looked back and this other group that came in after us got their order before me and all I got was the snow crab leg bag with corn and sausage. By the time I got my food my family was done so they had to wait for me. The food was delicious on the plus side! So I recommend you to come during a time where they are actually staffed, the lady who was supposed to be our server checked on us only twice. I gave it 3 stars because the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness!  

I was invited to this place on a first date.  I didn't know what to expect.  When my date began to explain the menu to me, my first thought was, this is going to be messy.   

The meat options that interested me were, snow crab, shrimp, fish and king crab.   My date and waitress recommended that I try the trifecta sauce since I was a first timer.  I went with the snow crab (in trifecta sauce) since it was much less expensive than the king crab.  King crab was $30 a lbs!!!  I had the option of adding red potatoes and corn on the cob to the snow crab which I did. 
When our food came out, I was surprised that our respective food orders were in tightly sealed plastic bags.  When I opened my bag, the delicious aroma flowed out. Wow!  I opened my bag by foldeding over the sides of the bag.  I looked around the table for my silverware wondering how I was going to eat this delicious smelling food using table etiquette Emily Post would be proud of.  As I was thinking my date said, \"Just put your hand in the bag.\"  Relieved, I put my hand in and grabbed a red potatoe, bit in and unknownly let out a mmmmm. Yes, it was perfect. I then moved on to the corn on the cob.  Equally delicious.   As I was reaching for my snow crab, wondering how I would crack the shell with couth, my date said, \"You have trifecta sauce all over your face.\" Embarrassing!!! He sensed my embarassment and said, \"It's okay. You're really cute making all those noises when you eat.\" Hahaa.  At that point I figured I was safe to really dig in to this crab.  As I dug in, cracking the shell of my crab, sauce and shell pieces flew all over us.  We laughed and enjoyed the drinks and atmosphere of this location.  It was messy despite using the plastic green bibs provided to us.  The food was amazing and filling.  Being an old school gentleman, my date paid for our meal and drinks so I cannot comment on the total pricing of our dinner.  I can say, I will definitely be visiting Angry Crab again!  

For those of you wondering, yes, there is a second date scheduled!  Score!!"}
{"text":"No bueno. Out of ribs, chicken and brisket. Clearly don't care to have alternatives to Seafood."}
{"text":"My first experience was not the best but not the worst either. Staff was friendly and attentive. We went for my mother's birthday. She stated the snow crab was good. My daughters had the kids chicken fingers which appeared to be previously frozen, then fried in store. Not the best. The cod was more like a fried tenderloin finger instead of the traditional cod fillet that is battered in house and fried. I was most surprised by the dead Dungeness crab in the tank. It was removed shortly after I advised the staff. The place is oddly covered in patron signatures, which was new to me but pretty cool."}
{"text":"Still prefer Boiling Crab, but this is the next best thing for this area.

Despite waiting 1 hour and 15 minutes, even though it was Valentine's Day, the food over there was good. Thankfully.

Order a pound of mussels, 2 lb of shrimp, everything in the trifecta seasoning, number 4 spicy.
Had some corn, potato, and sausage, and rice on the side.

Tons of lime used for this, as number 4 spicy is really spicy. The spicy level does go up to number 6, which I'm guessing would be way too spicy. I would have been fine with the number three spicy for a enjoyable meal. Number 4 is probably the most I would tolerate for spiciness but less enjoyable due to the spicy but still edible at the same time, but you will need a lot of lime And water. 

In terms of the flavor, the trifecta is pretty good. But definitely still preferred The Boiling Crab everything seasoning as there's more spices or, I don't know how to describe it, there's just more pieces of flavor in their sauce and less over here. Shrimp was good. I would definitely not order the mussels again as it was just wasn't that good. Even the sauce that the mussels was in, which was supposed to be Trifecta, but just felt a little bit more dried. Not sure exactly why.

Overall cost wasn't too expensive I think the total came out to around $40. 
Pretty good server and waitress. They do take a bit longer in terms of seating people down. But they do have a phone messaging / online time counter. Which was nice. But some tables took forever to be clean which delayed the service for everybody. And apparently you can make reservation as well, so maybe try that next time.

I would definitely come back here for my Boiling Crab craving. Just make a reservation."}
{"text":"The seafood boils here are on point - there's no denying that.  
The barbeque, however, left a lot to be desired.  
I just can't get excited about meat that's too dry to enjoy without being slathered with sauce that's far too sweet.  Yes, I'm a sauce whore, but I like to try my meats w/o first - then compliment them with appropriate sauces.  But when you claim to be both a crab shack and bbq joint - and you only have one sauce that's almost cloyingly sweet, you make it impossible to give you that 5th star.

Oh - and the siren that gets fired up every time someone does some thing that I don't care to know?  Yeah it gave me a headache.  And I'm not the guy that complains about loud noises, but this was every few minutes and in an already louder than average environment.

That said - the boils are delicious and you should totally try them - just don't bother with the bbq."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for awhile, however was kinda thrown off as I was told the food comes out whole - heads, tails, the whole 9 yards.  I had a friend who is pickier than me go here for dinner and she loved so, we went Saturday night for an early dinner and let me tell you I LOVE IT.  And coming out whole sounds worse than it really is.  I don't like a lot of spice so I did lemon/pepper and garlic, no heat, with a pound of shrimp corn and potatoes.  One son got the snow crab legs, the other got calamari and fried shrimp, we also tried the gator nuggets for an appetizer.  The nuggets were spicy, but I was able to eat them, my boys thought they were great, just enough heat. The only reason I can't give 5 stars is our server, sorry Caitlyn but you must have been having an off day.  She knew we were first timers and she came to our table twice, once to introduce herself and next to take our orders.  We had to get up and ask for utensils, we had to get up and ask for refills on drinks - twice.  We sat between two other tables and the guys waiting on those tables were awesome, seemed like they came to check on those tables every 3 - 5 minutes.  I'll go back because I have to say the food is AWESOME and I'm sure I'll get another server who will be more attentive."}
{"text":"Okay...service is horrible. I literally live right across the street from this place and would have loved to make this our watering hole. I had a lb. of shrimp which was great but the guy literally didn't come around to bring me a refill at all since these puppies were spicy and I even asked him for a root beer and when I told him that he forgot it and it had been about 20 minutes...he said do you still want it? While I was pondering...he said yeah you do and brought it to me and charged me for it. I get it that I still drank it but really? Ya you do? Let me answer for myself. Or if you're making the decision for me, you pay for it!  My friend ordered brisket and it looked like it was kind of jelly like. It seemed super fatty and he said it was not appetizing. I guess do not come here for their brisket! Either way, being previous servers, we tipped our 20% and left unsatisfied. Bummer!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic! Best clams I've ever had outside of a clam bake. Prices were fair for such good tasting seafood. The atmosphere is not meant to be classy. Just know that ahead of time. It's kitschy and is what it is. What was the most impressive was the speedy service staff and kindness. Our waitress was very open about what she recommends. Very impressed!"}
{"text":"For the last few weeks I have had a hankering for seafood. But in landlocked Arizona finding quality seafood can be a challenge. Since Seattle and Boston are not in my near term travel plans, I have been doing some scouting for a good seafood joint right here in the valley. 
Today I struck pay-dirt at the Angry Crab thanks to guidance from Yelp reviews. 
This is a no-nonsense joint in Phoenix. Quite a hike from Scottsdale but it was worth the 30 some miles I drove to get there. 
My lunch consisted of half a dozen charred oysters to get warmed up and a modest 2 pound Dungeness crab. Both items more than exceeded my expectations. 
The Dungeness was exceptional. You choose the size of the crab, select the type of sauce you want, decide on the level of heat on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 denotes wimpy and 5 is ghost pepper). Finally you decide if you want to add items such as veggies (about half a dozen options). The crab is delivered to you in a bag and the fun starts. 
Having had the opportunity to relish spicy crab in Singapore on a number of occasions, I can attest to the fact that this preparation was as good, if not better, than the Singaporean variety. 
Staff was friendly and efficient. The ambience is a cross between a sports bar and a gastropub. 
This is one for the books."}
{"text":"Been to this location twice. Both times, not so great .

My first experience here was on a typical Friday night I was expecting it to be busy but I didn't expect to get seat in 10mins & to wait another hour in half for my food after ordering . Everything came out slowly & at different times . I was really craving crawfish & once I got my order & dug in, I was very disappointed . I order 2lbs of Live Crawfish Trifecta Medium & every single crawfish was uncooked . I didn't know they were so literal when they asked if I wanted it live or frozen . 

My second experience was today, I decided to give this place another shot & beside the waiting from my first experience the crawfish was still uncooked . I'm starting to think that they're serious about the crawfish being live & expecting me to eat it that way . I also ordered clams & there was hardly anything in my bag.. just a lot of seasoning inside the clam shells . So be careful when ordering clams or you'll jst be eating a mouth full of seasonings .

My overall experience was ehh.. okay . I just wish they would learn how to cook the crawfish better . I don't think I'll be giving this location anymore chances but it was worth a try ."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the quality of the food. The sweet potato fries was burnt and over fried. The trifecta crawfish tasted bland and lacked flavor. However, the severs and staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Went here for a dinner for a birthday party for a family member. Waited a long time to be seated. When we were seated, they did not get the right amount of seats and were unwilling to accomodate our need (which was made clear prior to our long wait). Part of the family had to sit at aother table. The service was subpar. Waitress inattentive and  several of our orders were wrong. In regards to the food....not impressed. Could have bought cheaper food at a grocery store and had a better experience. Wont ever step foot in this place again"}
{"text":"What can I say but yum?  This place rocks!  It has such a fun lively atmosphere, a full bar, a great staff and the food!  Oh the food!  It's outstanding!  It's like a southern Louisiana crawfish boil event in a restaurant form!  Go eat and enjoy! You'll love it!"}
{"text":"I give them 4-stars only because it's a fun family environment. My girls liked eating off the table for a change and getting super messy. The food is just OK. Fun place though."}

When I first came to Angry Crab Shack I was a tad bit disappointed, but I said I would give this place time to get adjusted. 

Needless to say, I'm glad I did so as I came back this time around, it was much better.  The place was still tacky like most crawfish joints.  Décor is definitely not their forte.  The place was loud and smelly just like the way it should be!  Service is still a little too slow for my taste, but the place was popping.  No excuses made here, but feel they need to improve on that respect.  

My friends and I ordered a pound of crawfish each along with some oysters and blue crab.  The crawfish this time around was much better.  Spicy as heck and messy to eat!  The crawfish soaked in the spicy sauce really covered the fishy smell I distaste from all seafoods.  Like most crawfish; little meat, but so worth it!  Our oysters were perfect with added lime/lemon and some tabasco sauce of course; making this dish a must every time you come!  My blue crabs were sweet as it should be and boy was it good to eat some steamed blue crab again.  Overall, great atmosphere and great food.  Generally, I feel crawfish boil joints are for fun with just friend having drinks and cracking away.  Don't usually get full from these places, but definitely worth attending for some fun and food! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went there for 4th of July and it was a little busy but still got seated right away. First time there and it was good food, but took awhile to get food out to you but was good. Expensive but expected and service was nice and attentive. Fries are delicious, but poboys are messy as heck to eat. Seafood real good and hot since you get it as soon as they get it cooked. No plates or utensils just hands, maybe a shell cracker, table with paper as your plate and bunch of paper towels as your napkins. Also food comes to you in bags by the pounds of whatever you ordered. So if you don't mind wearing bibs and getting hands dirty the food is good, but expensive as seafood goes."}
{"text":"We had an excellent lunch! The Cod Angry basket was perfect for our 2 young kids to share and my hubs and I each enjoyed a pound of snow crab. The garlic seasoning was pretty good but the garlic mixed with Pacific Rim was  amazing! I'll get that next time. MADYSON was a wonderful server and paid special attention to each of our children, which allowed us a few minutes of time to focus on our own meals. She even took the girls to see the crabs & lobsters in the tank!"}
{"text":"Overall we had a pretty good experience. When we walked in we were met by some snarky comments by the hostess regarding our seating preferences. Thankfully our server Kyle was extra nice and cheered us up with his great service and smile! The food did not dissapoint! We had snow crab legs & Cajun frys. The sauces run on the spicy side but Kyle warned us of that, which we appreciated. We'll go back again, I'm sure. Hopefully the greeting we get from the hostess will be more welcoming next time."}
{"text":"So excited to have this little gem in our neighborhood. Last night, my husband and I rode our bikes over to check this place out for the first time.

We tired a few things off the menu and it was all fantastic. The snow crab in lemon... YUM! The shrimp paired with sausage and potatoes in the trifecta sauce YUM! We were even blown away by the ribs and their mac and cheese! No date night is complete without a cocktail and they have a whole list of delicious concoctions. 

Miesha took care of us and this lady is the DEFINITION   of a great server! As first timers,  she explained the menu to us thoroughly, made a few suggestions and checked on us periodically to make sure we were OK. Her service alone gets 5 stars!

I can't wait until it starts to warm up a bit and we can enjoy some time on their patio.  The only thing I can suggest  (and maybe we couldn't find it) is if you could please add a bike rack."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come to the Angry Crab ever since it opened. Tons of my friends rave about this place so it was definitely on my list, but I'm rarely in the area so the opportunity just hasn't been there. Finally had the chance to come here for dinner on a Thursday night around 6pm. The restaurant was packed but we only had to wait three minutes for a table (although the waitress said the wait can be up to TWO HOURS on weekends!!! Crazy!). 

Our waitress, Julie, gave us a rundown of our seafood options and how to order - pick a meat, pick your seasonings, add extra spice if you want, and select any extras/sides (corn, potatoes, etc). I got a pound of snow crab legs with the \"trifecta\" seasoning (Cajun seasoning, lemon, salt, and garlic) and my brother got a whole lobster with the Pacific Rim seasoning (coconut curry sauce). We opted not to get any sides, which in retrospect was a mistake. It would've been nice to have some bread or potatoes to sop up the extra sauce, and we were both still slightly hungry after we devoured the seafood. We waited about fifteen minutes before the food arrived in individual plastic bags, not plates. Presentation isn't fancy but it was delicious, delicious, delicious!!!  

The overall ambiance of the restaurant was unimpressive. I am not a big fan of the graffiti all over the walls, tables, and chairs. To me, it just looks dirty and.... a little ratchet. The tables are covered in paper to help with the messiness of the meal. Our drinks were served in paper cups and we had plastic utensils (but real crab cracking tools). I understand that it's a tradeoff - affordable seafood means you don't get cloth napkins, real cutlery, and classy decor. It's not a super nice restaurant but absolutely worth it for the food and experience.

A few notes: Don't wear anything nice - you will be messy despite the bib they give you and an endless supply of napkins. They gave my brother a big rock to smash his lobster, which we both thought was hilarious. It was very effective but it would've been nice to have a \"pokey\" tool to help get the lobster meat out of the shell. The exterior of the restaurant is plain and unassuming, which matches the rundown plaza it's located in. This is not a good place for a first date or a new relationship... you won't have any dazzling conversation because the two of you will be busy smashing lobster shells, ripping apart crab legs, and getting covered in sauce.

$56 for a pound of crab and the lobster, with one soda on the side. Not an everyday restaurant but a great place for a fun meal and tasty seafood."}
{"text":"Food is good, not great depending on what you order. Some of the shrimps and snow crab and crawfish were either too salty or did not have much flavor. The staff are very very nice though! Fried calamari and onion rings and fries were amazing. I'd just try to get the flavor right, or maybe it was just this once. Overall very good and will be back."}
{"text":"This place isn't even good. Their sauce was lacking a lot of flavor (trio). It had more oil to it than flavor. Crawfish and shrimp were bland. The shrimp was overcooked and rubbery. Oysters were tasteless. I think the only thing I liked was the cajun fries but that was just okay as well. They don't do combos, only by the pound. This place didn't live up to my expectations like I thought it would."}
{"text":"Wanted to love this place - how can you go wrong with eating seafood with your hands?

Answer:  by dumping it in a plastic bag covered with wet spice.  

King crab legs had prob the best taste and consistency.  The shrimp were mush - obviously frozen and then overcooked.

Veggies were good.

Oysters were a bit hacked on the half shell and def had a Rocky Point flavor vs Pacific or East Coast brininess.

Took forever to order but waitress was friendly.  Bartender surly but good pour.

Great heat in the #4 spice but get it in the side unless you like it hottttt."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday before the rush! The service was great and the Shrimp was excellent and large!!!

The fried oyster was OK and the ambiance was great!!!

We got the trifecta hot!!!"}
{"text":"Been to the other angry crabs. This is a great location the west valley is dying for some good food in this area!

I gave 4 stars just because of the not so cold corona. Other then that I love the check in service they use. Very convenient."}
{"text":"Visiting from California, I was really surprised and excited that they had a seafood place like this in Arizona (we have tons in the bay area.) Food was great! Had a hiccup when we found a not all the way cooked shrimp in our bag,but the manager and server took care of it immediately. Super friendly atmosphere. Would definitely recommend this place and looking forward to come back the next time I visit Arizona :)"}
{"text":"Was looking for a good time to give this place a try and lunch with the old man was it.  We stopped in for lunch and had a very good experience.  The staff was very friendly and the food was very good.  My father had the catfish with fries and I had the cod po' boy with fries.  Both entrees tasted as one would expect.  The entrees were good and the prices at $8 and $9  were very favorable.  The side of fries were some of the best fries I have enjoyed with wonderful seasoning.  We also ordered a side of hush puppies and they were tasty. For dessert, we tried the red velvet cheesecake, which was awesome.  A visit in the future will be in order.

On a side note, I like that they place your beverage in a to go cup so one can take a refill for the road. Nice touch."}
{"text":"Excellent service, mixed bag crab legs huge shrimp plenty of mussels.  Live fresh crawfish boil, they were small, but I'm from Texas and I can't get them in Hawaii, so I'll take it.  Get the house butter garlic Cajun spice on everything.  You will need the plastic bib they give you."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to dinner here as a silly date and man is this place just the coolest! We order 1 lb each or the snow crab legs with their famous seasoning and I went for the mild level of the heat while my boyfriend did the medium. The service is just so nice and understanding."}
{"text":"Had the shrimp trifecta!  Deeeeeeelicious!  The atmosphere is fun and family friendly!  Go ahead make a mess!  Service was excellent and this will be a spot we frequent!"}
{"text":"I like this place better than Hot and Juicy.  When in the mood for Cajun seafood- this is the place to go to!"}
{"text":"It's a copy-cat of Boiling Crab as many of you might know. The cajun sauce is still not up to par, it's OK. When the bags of seafood are delivered to the table, they're not hot to the touch but just barely warm.

Make sure the orders come with the sides you ordered, we were a group of 8 people, and they messed up the sides of 4 orders.

I've called this place twice on a Thursday and nobody answers, so I thought the place was packed or busy. But once I got there, the servers were just standing there with really nothing much to do."}
{"text":"All about this place. Seriously. I crave this place. Like now. I am totally going back tonight because I have been craving Angry Crab for DAYS. And I have been fighting the urge. No more! I am giving into it."}
{"text":"First time here... David was AMAZING!!! An East Coast'er in love (though i felt like an a$$ in my bib, it was totally worth it! I had snow crab in trifecta mild-yum!!"}
{"text":"Good: super delicious and yummy and fresh! And the price is reasonable. The service is warm and timely. 
Bad: I hope they have more veggie soaked in that awesome spicy sauce, not just corns. I believe some lettuce would be prefect. Too many people waiting, they need larger area too!"}
{"text":"I had heard so much about this place and finally went. During the week it's slow and nice to chill. Nice bar selection. So you order a# of whatever seafood you like (i.e. Shrimp or mussels or crab legs...) you order the stewing sauce ( I did garlic butter) then the heat level, I got #1 and it was a little spicier than I would've predicted but good for me. I would recommend the blue crabs as they don't have a lot of meat and weren't filling. Otherwise we got shrimp (nice size with heads on a lot of shrimp for around $13), mussels (very tasty and fresh), crab legs ($18). All very good and fun eat with your hands food. Hush puppies were yummy, slaw looked good, gumbo is a popular dish, they also do smoked meats on buns and pro boys... had bourbon pecan pie for dessert which I will get every time I go. Our waitress was helpful in explaining the menu and friendly and listened to all my husbands bad jokes. Great place, low key."}
{"text":"Spent my birthday dinner here and had a wonderful time. 

As I was flying solo, it wasn't hard for me to quickly get a table. My waitress was prompt and friendly and chatted me up once I told her it was my birthday and I was in town for work. 

I ordered a gumption hard cider which was only $4 and two pounds of snow crabs. I added two corn and two potatoes. 

The crabs were well seasoned on the outside but lacked the flavor inside that I was craving. Luckily, there was enough juice flowing that I dunked my crab in that and was satisfied. FYI, I like a lot of heat, but the medium trifecta was spicy! Definitely keep that in mind when ordering so you don't find yourself gagging and unable to enjoy your food. 

The corn and potatoes were good, although I felt I got super mini potatoes and for .50 ea, I needed two more to actually feel like I got a deal. 

I truly appreciated that my waitress hooked me up with free cheesecake and didn't embarrass me by outing to the whole restaurant that it was my birthday.

I'd definitely recommend this place to others. Good eats and fairly priced!"}
{"text":"Wow! Okay, my wife and I decided to try Angry Crab. We are pretty picky about seafood.  We were not disappointed; this is a hidden gem!!

Noel took great care of us and explained everything. We had gator bites, shrimp, pulled pork, and the HUGE favorite: charred oysters! Get a dozen and some veggies and that's a killer meal!!

An outstanding place; excellent food, and superb staff!  Thank you Noel!! We left stuffed and smiling!!"}
{"text":"Awesome, simply put. This place is awesome!

Inside, it looks like a typical seafood joint, like a Joe's Crab Shack or similar design. It's very open and the tables are well spaced, so you still have a bit of privacy when it gets full and loud. The server was pretty friendly, even for a casual place. Sure, it's not white glove service, but you shouldn't expect that from a casual place like this.

I started with the hush puppies. They were so good. Light like air, salty, and served with a great Cajun dipping sauce. I ordered two pounds of crab legs. They were well cooked and seasoned appropriately. Served with traditional drawn butter, potatoes, and corn on the cob. The coolest thing ever is that they serve it with plastic gloves. Such a good idea for crab legs to prevent your hands from smelling like butter for the next week or so. The crab is served in a plastic bag, which is unique too.

This place is definitely the best casual seafood joint in Phoenix. The atmosphere is so fun too!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! I can not say enough about the servers at Angry Crab! Our waitress was the sweetest waitress ever, and the rest of the staff was so fun. They even brought out a live lobster and gave all the kids some facts about lobsters(my inner homeschool self loved this ) They raved about how well behaved my kids were(what Mom doesn't love to hear that) and our amazing waitress even got hugs from my daughter. They made our guys birthday dinner super special! Not to mention it was delicious! I've not had meat in 3 months and even I indulged in the YUMMMM of it all!  I didn't get a picture with our waitress and I'm seriously sad I didn't!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Better with more people willing to share, I had a great time but the service lacked. I was by myself so I get it but the food was great! The bartender got my order wrong but it was great either way. Awesome place for a family outing or friends from out of town."}
{"text":"Most HORRIBLE dining experience ever!!!  Dined here for a birthday on Sept 26th with a party of 8  and our server John K. messed up consistently throughout the meal.  From MULTIPLE INCORRECT orders/reorders, after consuming all the food we had to ask to get the table cleared (He only cleared it for the individual that asked when the entire table was clearly finished with their meal), Had to request a dessert menu which he brought only 1, Requested a surprise birthday cake & informed him to ask the birthday boy's girlfriend to pick a flavor and he directly asks the birthday boy instead, incorrect checks-incorrect split checks, over charges, and extensive wait to get our credit cards returned back to the table.

Emailed Angry Crab when I got home about this experience &  Autumn replied with an apologetic email and an invite back to the restaurant and stated that she would send a $100 gift card.  It's been almost a MONTH and I still haven't received the gift card.  I even sent out an email inquiring about the gift card & she stated that it was covered under paperwork and was sent the day she replied which was two weeks ago.

This was absolutely a terrible experience!!! Especially the over charge of $400!!!!  This reflects poorly on the management staff, they need to train/coach their servers.   Autumn needs to work on her follow through of customer issues.  Apparently it's not important to her which is quite astonishing. Being in an upper management position myself, I can say that any gift card, coupon, refund issues I've personally dealt with immediately to drive the customer loyalty."}
{"text":"I was pretty hesitant about this place since Joe's Crab Shack was pretty disgusting so assumed it may be similar. I was sooo wrong. This place is soo good!  The trifecta sauce is AWESOME!! I love the heat level. The medium has pretty decent heat but if you love spicey go for the hot. I had the gumbo, clams, shrimp, and snow crab and they we're all terrific. I'm definitely returning."}
{"text":"Our group had both seafood and BBQ. The seafood process is picking out the protein, the flavor of sauce then how spicy you want it and you pay per pound. shrimp comes head on (so they don't have to do more work & they make more money) and was good. BBQ was very bland, no flavor and was cold even on different types of meats and plates. This place seems lmore like a novelty place with average food, not an actual restaurant. We tried it and will move on, doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"We finally went here after hearing so much about it...it's really quite good! We'll come again. The night we went they were sold out of crawfish which was a bummer since it was the entire reason we came but the shrimp and crab were great. Wish it was located in a better part of town. Maybe they'll open another location!"}
{"text":"Prepare to get messy!

Simple and basic menu. Not a whole lot of choices for appetitizers. But not a big deal because it's only a matter of a few minutes that your meal is served after ordering. Very quick turnaround time from the point you order and the point of \"digging in\".  I ordered the King Crab with cajun seasoning and medium spice. My boyfriend got the same but shrimp instead. We both enjoyed our seafood. Delicious!  I wish they would have had some appealing sides on their menu. The ones they did have listed just sounded kinda blah. Maybe something like red beans & rice, dirty rice, fried green tomatoes, or fried okra would have gone nicely with the meal. All in all pretty good experience. The only disappointment was it took the waitress about 10 minutes to realize we were finished with our meals and still needed refills of iced tea. And then another 5 minutes to wait for the check. We will return."}
{"text":"Great 1st visit! Greeted immediately, enthusiastic but not bite-your-leg-off aggressive. Server politely explained the awesome, not easily-found seafood concept (here in AZ) with this great way to go for it and eat seafood southern style.

In a nutshell, I went the bbq route w/my son, who didn't feel like seafood (huh?). Anyway, we didn't suffer.  Food and service was solid, and the cajun fries?  PERHAPS the best I've ever had, outstanding quality, temperature, crispiness, flavor. YUM!

Greg was server, and a job well done, Angry Crew.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"It started off bad when the dyslexic hostess got my ph# wrong and our 20 minute wait turned into a 40 minute wait, so make sure they get that correct so you can be paged. Now admittedly, I don't like seafood, so the smell of the entire restaurant was a little nauseating, but the girlfriend LOVES the stuff & she was paying, so that's where we ended up. The atmosphere of the entire restaurant was a little too boisterous & chaotic for me, almost like one of those places you go and pay to have the servers be rude to you, but not actually the case. The food came out in 3 chapters with the easiest (my chicken finger basket) coming out first, the fried gator second & the steamed snow crab last about 10 minutes later. The chicken fingers were pretty good, well breaded and not overdone with pretty tasty ranch dressing. The gator was a little overdone and the breading tasted a bit like burnt toast. The fries were a little under-seasoned, but that may have something to do with the smell of the multiple bags of cooked sea life overwhelming EVERYTHING. The snow crab was reportedly average, although the corn steamed along with it was the highlight of the little lady's meal. Service was slightly subpar, and overall I can't say I was terribly impressed. I'll eventually try again, just to be sure I didn't like it."}
{"text":"They have a pretty good selection and the food is good. They service was pretty good as well. The only thing I didn't like is that the food came by the pound and you couldn't alternate it to a half pound. Other than that, I have no complaints. Side Note: They have a level 6 seasoning thats not on the menu that will knock your socks off!"}

{"text":"Honestly, the best part of the visit was our server, Liz, who provided great service. 

Our alligator tasted awesome but was a little over done. The potato salad was very bland and had almost no taste. The Cajun fries were good. 

The worst part was the shrimp we ordered. It was so overcooked that it was rubbery and very tough. When we left we were not very impressed. And for the rest of the day neither my husband nor I felt well and we were perfectly fine before eating there. 

Needless to say we will not be returning."}
{"text":"2/16/14 - Sunday funday dinner... ordered dungeness crab, shrimp, king crab legs etc... Noel was great and even though they were hopelessly under staffed he maintained a great attitude and was super cool.

This one is hard because while I'm sure having yummy seafood in a plastic bag dumped on a paper covered table for you to claw your way into like a caveman totally seems like a good time, it's not for me. 

Trying to get the shrimp out of their carcass and having hot juice squish out at you as you squeeze the head is just gross to me. Sorry. 

Trust me, if you're looking for this type of experience, this is definitely a fantastic place!!! I'm totally going to go back but will order something involving less manual labor and crab brains. 

Good place to learn patience or teamwork - incredibly bad if you're starving and can't get the shells off or a first date."}
{"text":"Wow, this was really good.  Absolutely loved the shrimp!  The Dungeoness crab was good, too, but quite a bit of work to get through.  The breaded soft-shell crab suited the kids who were with us that evening. The only downside was that the blue crab and clams were not available that night.  Guess will have to come back to try!"}
{"text":"Holy amazingness. Food is fantastic service is great. Fun way to eat. Bring baby wipes if you don't like getting your hands dirty (like me lol) but you need to try this place!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in town right now. I'm in love with the flavors. The services is fast and they are very friendly, even when I order To-go.  I always order 1lb of shrimp trifecta with the heat level 4 which is very spicy and I burns so good. The beer selection is nice. The margaritas are strong. I try to limit my guilty pleasure to twice a month but sometimes I just can't help myself..YUMMY!"}
{"text":"It does not deliver the authentic taste of good crawfish..I spend $33.00 on two pounds. They were super tiny and it's crawfish season.  I ordered the spiciest with two potatoes, three corn and four sausage.  

The crawfish were drrrrry and had no flavor with no spice at all. The corn were decent.  The potatoes were biilg gigantic rustic potatoes cut in half. I am use to the small red potatoes the seasoning soaks into those easily.  The sausage were literally four cut small sausages that you had to search in the rubble for instead of whole sausage links.

I will never return. I just got back from Houston so the taste is no comparison.  I just wasted my money and time. Or go to Vegas.

They do not serve liquor either.."}
{"text":"Ordered 3meal meat and soup was gumbo. Too much charcoal on the meats. Gumbo delicious later though felt so thirsty,guess too much salt.
We we're big party after 1pm people started coming in."}
{"text":"This was a pretty cool place! Been there only once but it was good. Really neat environment and lots of fun!! Portions were very good. It was loud, but not over the top. Service was good and overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"This was a pretty cool place! Been there only once but it was good. Really neat environment and lots of fun!! Portions were very good. It was loud, but not over the top. Service was good and overall it was a good experience. You should give it a shot !"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times with my family of 5 however won't be returning due to a few issues... one is the food, VERY greasy! The vegetables were in a bag floating in grease &wayy too mushy... the shrimp was so moist with grease we had to 'dry' it on a napkin before eating it... the staff is punky, loud, & cracked out yelling random, undetectable sh**! The hostesses seem like they are VERY unhappy with their job...no smile whatsoever... &who wears sunglasses at 8pm. while working?! Too many employees not knowing what theyre doing...the only plus side to this place...the generous portion of wine...in a mason jar. Will we be back? Nope!!"}
{"text":"Food is still pretty good, though they have totally pared down their original offerings in terms of cocktails, and some menu items.

This place started out as the new hot place in the neighborhood, but unfortunately has steadily gone downhill.
They used to have great service but now it's meh. All the female staff decided to wear yoga pants. Someone thought it'd be a good idea.
Ummmm, nope!

They used to have utensils to crack the shells. Nope. Horseradish for oysters on the half? Nope.
Ask twice....nope!

I'm a sucker for the trifecta, and the food is still pretty good but it's definitely gone downhill."}
{"text":"Great place if you like peel-and-eats and cajun style shellfish.  I came to this place for the first time a few weeks ago and have been back almost twice a week since.  Coming from LA and being used to Boiling Crab, I can safely say that this place is a pretty good substitute.  

Their trifecta sauce is very tasty and probably your best bet if you want something with a lot of flavor.  The levels of spiciness vary and are not very consistent; you may order a level 4 and have it taste like a level 2 in one bag and like a level 4 in the another bag.  Same goes for other items that require sauces, such as the cole slaw.  I order it a couple of times and the first time it was good, but the second time it was dry with little mayonnaise on it.

If you're looking to get crawfish, lobster, and some of the crabs it's a good idea to call in advance and ask if they have it because they rarely have them in stock. However, if you get your hands on the crawfish you'll be lovin' life!  They also have whole lobsters so if you like eating everything including the head, be my guest!  Aside from that, the shrimp have never failed me and are always my go-to order, and their crab is surprisingly more meaty than you would expect for a place in Mesa (snowcrab is the best one).  And make sure you get an order of cajun fries to soak up all the trifecta sauce."}
{"text":"We are big fans of Crab, well let's be honest - big fans of food in general.  We were excited to try this establishment based on a recommendation from a friend.  Atmosphere is fun and lively, hand written notes all over the walls and booths.  Their main deal is a seafood bag, if your like me it may remind of you the Feed Bag story from the onion.  It doesn't attach to your face, but our crab was good enough we wish it had.

For drinks we started off with waters, being 115 degrees outside we were rather thirsty.  It was disappointing they came in cups that were a little larger than a shot glass.  The kids meal came with a bigger drink than our waters.  It is definitely a pet peeve of mine when a restaurant can't even figure out how to serve water.   

One person wasn't feeling seafood so ordered a cheeseburger, then was informed the restaurant doesn't have yellow mustard.

The kids chicken tenders were pretty lame, one of the tenders was almost all breading and no chicken.

I left with mixed feelings."}
{"text":"We were excited to have a new option in the neighborhood. We had a very underwhelming experience.  We got a cup of water at the beginning of our meal and never got a refill the rest of the meal. The sandwiches are pretty much all bread, the meat just falls all over the place. Everything tastes the same. It was a pretty pricey meal for what we got and to not even get a refill. We waited nearly half an hour for two sandwiches and two kids meals in a not even half full restaurant. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been there twice both times averaging 3 stars. The first time was a great experience - food was good, service was great. 
The 2nd time was just fair. Our table wobbled and after asking for assistance, I ended up folding a napkin and trying to fix it myself. When that didn't work, we requested to move to a better table, which we did.   When our food came, my bag had a small hole which made the sauce leak and not so appetizing. The food still tasted very good but the service was just fair. 
For My third attempt to eat there, we wanted it to go. Upon calling, it took 3 tries to get a human answer. She gladly put me on hold and never returned. I hung up after 4min of waiting and am now having a burrito instead of crawfish for dinner. Too bad."}
{"text":"This is a great store really good food the location is really easy to find if I remember correctly it is right on the end of the shopping center which makes it even easier to find and you can see the store from the road overall the quality of the food was great atmosphere is nice I had a fun time at this place I would check it out also the prices seemed pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"Talk about having fun with playing with your food! Lol I have never been to Louisiana to expedite this type of cooked seafood Cajun style in a bag and it was amazing!! And prices are reasonable too!! Great times and great food! The staff is alway happy and smiling!"}
{"text":"OK....fair warning....I hate sea food. I walked in this place and the smell was awful...yet oddly alluring. 

However, this place is so cool! We had some of the best service I have ever had, and the food was great. Granted, I did get chicken strips, but I tried it all. The alligator bites were surprisingly delicious...like really really good...try them...NOW! I tried various seafood bug meat...or crab/shrimp...whatever you call it...I call it bug meat....It was all very good though. Would defiantly bring someone here who loves Cajun type seafood.

Our waiter Noel did a phenomenal job with such a large group of guys. Better service than some 4 star restaurants we go to."}
{"text":"If loud, noisy, and messy is your thing, this place is for you. We tried the chips w/bbq pork app, and the fried calamari and calm app. Wish we could forget them both. It has been 2 days and still regret ordering them. We shared a pound of shrimp at the #2 spice level. They were actually pretty tasty, a good size, and cooked just enough but I just don't like having to pull the heads off and peal them!! I also am not a vino snob, but a don't like to drink my vino out of a mason jar. I am giving 2 stars because our server was delightful."}
{"text":"I love a good seafood boil.  I ordered the snow crab, shrimp and mussels.  The peel and eat shrimp are a good size with only the odd shrimp not being clean.  Crab was pretty good but it's a bit tricky to get all the crab when all they give you is a pair of scissors.  I do like the fact that you can order crawfish.

They have a hand washing station at the back which is a nice touch.  Unfortunately the large garbage bin full of table scraps sitting right beside it was a bit distracting and not in a good way.  

Service was a bit slow considering it was a weeknight.  Graffiti on all the walls gives it that super casual feel."}
{"text":"I don't know where DL ate with his horrendous review, and was he the only one  in his party with such problems? My husband and I ate here last night and I read DL!s review as I waited for my meal.  The review was nauseating and unbelievable, since this place rocks!  I haven't written a review on aYelp before, but felt compelled to do so because a) DL's review is off the Mark - way off and b) we had a great meal.  To start, the cornbread was great. Warm and fresh, and my husband had catfish, which he raved about. I had soft-shelled crab,and I can honestly say this was the best I've ever eaten, very meaty , tasty, and cooked to perfection.  The Cajun fries, and sweet potato fries were great - criispy and hot and seasoned to perfection. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ben was the best waiter I ever had! The food was great. This is my new hang out for happy hour now. 

Update...  I guess Ben is what made it special. The wait staff is lacking. There are no customers in the bar and I sat here for 10 minutes with no one even even looking my way. Ugh! I really loved it the first time but the second and third time the wait staff was horrible. We both ordered water and never got it even though we reminded her several times. We ended the meal never getting it."}
{"text":"Went to Angry Crab for a birthday dinner.   Crabs, shrimp and catch of day, were ordered.  Everyone was happy with their choice.

Originally from the the East Coast - we did not have high expectations from a crab place in Az.  Wow !  Great service and great food.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! I ordered the Dungeness Crab and my wife had the Snow crabs. Food was great! The Cajun Fries were also boom. I think the Angry Crab is a great addition to Mesa, AZ. My only suggestion is to be careful, the level of spice can easily be underestimated. Go as often as possible, I really don't wanna see this place close."}
{"text":"The bartender was amazing.
The food was ok.
The price is why I won't be back.
Don't say because \"it's seafood\"... you can get better prices and more food at any other place. Hell, even red lobster will be more consistent in my mind."}
{"text":"O.M.G. seriously I cannot rave enough about this place. The trifecta sauce was ridiculous. I wish I had ordered more red potatoes or bread to dip into the left over sauce. I got the mild which was just enough spice for me. My boyfriend got the medium which was a good amount of spice if you're looking for a little bit more kick. I definitely recommend going during the week for a shorter wait time. Our server was awesome and attentive and gave great advice. I wish I could eat here every day!"}
{"text":"This review is for the Avondale store only 
We haven't been to the others

Don't let this look of this place from the outside hold you back. It did for us for quite some time
This place used to be a Chinese buffet or something and it's Avondale and it's on Litchfield south of the 10
This is like three strikes and you're out right??!?

Went in on a whim with my daughter and was completely surprised.  This place is fun and the food is awesome!

Others have posted how you get your food so I won't but I will say that the trifecta blend of seasoning is perfect and I love the level three
Get extra corn because the corn is the best when it's just been soaking for 30min inside that saucy bag!!

Go in and check this place out tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for Cajun/crab shack like places. Flavors are banging and they're spice level is a little hotter than other places I've been to. 

Now if you're one of those people who don't mind a very laid back environment while eating you mind this place at all. BUT I've came here with some family who aren't such fans and didn't quite enjoy this place like I do. They weren't a fan of the waitresses sitting at your table with you while they take your order, the obnoxious screaming/announcement when someone orders something with the hottest spice level, or the overall noise level of this place. Noise level is probably similar to that of a sports bar.
HOWEVER If you're only looking for a great food place and don't mind the laid back environment like me then this place is awesome! Great seafood AND bbq selection and the food comes out fairly quick. Only reason I docked a star is because every time I've came around dinner time, they get busy to the point where they forget to check up on you and I've waited a while every time for beer or water refills. 

4/14 UPDATE: I've been here countless times, still love it because I love their shrimp, BUT today was the 3rd time that my boyfriend wanted a 3 meat platter and had to choose something else because they ran out of 2 of the 4 meat choices. Unfortunately we didn't find this out until after we ordered. I understand that it's THAT good and we came at 8 o'clock but if you're supposed to be open until 11, there may be some other people who come in late wanting your yummy BBQ. Just saying ?"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service, are delicious food. There are no stars and glamour here, just good food.  My wife had the snow crab pot and I had the shrimp pot both at different spicy levels (2/3). Add the andouille to your pot.  I'd recommend to anybody."}
{"text":"Service horrible..   I had to ask for menu's?? Skinny bartender chick kept wiping her sniffles, don't know if she was sick or on drugs?? Either way she shouldn't have been handling food!  Disgusting.  Ordered beef brisket and my friend ordered catfish.  My beef brisket came out 10 minutes after my friend got his food. (We ordered together). 
 AND THE BEEF SANDWICH  WAS COLD!! Wt f?!!
We told the bartender and she offered to bring another 1. But at this point I lost my appetite.  They still charged me for it.  
I will never step a foot in there again."}
{"text":"Best seafood in town. My wife and I are regulars at the Angry Crab. Love the affordable prices and delicious food. The majority of the staff are great. I'll continue going here for years to come."}
{"text":"Since my last review my family and I have visited several times.  The service has improved immensely! I am an even bigger fan now and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Food was awesome!!!! Had shrimp, snow crab, and crawfish Trifecta style medium hot....tasted nothing like it before! Would definately go again...only getting 4 stars cause they were out of the blue crab tonight :("}
{"text":"Went here on the grand opening day.   The food was amazing and had lots of flavor.  Came back a month later and the food was extremely bland.   I also gave them another chance after that and same outcome."}
{"text":"Great place.i have tried a similar place called hot and juicy crawfish. This place is very close. My only beef was that the sausage was not very good. It was more of a kielbasa then and andouille. For spicy lovers, the 3 was not bad at all. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Had oysters, a shrimp Po Boy, and the crab pie and its was all horrible. The seafood was not fresh, no flavor, no seasoning, and terrible quality. To bw honest i threw it away. I've had better food out of the frozen section of Walmart."}
{"text":"Fabulous meal! Fabulous service! We enjoyed everything we ordered - oysters on the half shell, lobster, brisket and snow crab legs. The Clam Digger (Bloody Mary) was so good, we had to order more. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has such a unique menu.  It is a fun atmosphere. If you are a seafood lover and like spicy food, this is the place for you.  My favorite is the snow crab legs, trifecta style.

Beware!  You will make a mess!  Don't wear white or you will regret it."}
{"text":"Catfish was great!!  Love the spicy fries.  Bag of shrimp and bag of crab Cajun flavor was dynamite.   We will be back here for sure."}
{"text":"Delicious! Trifecta sauce and shrimp is the bomb.com. Eat here, it's that good people."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. The server was outstanding and explained the entire menu and made some suggestions on what to order.

I had the catfish with onion rings. Catfish was very moist and tender and the pepper-forward breading was good but a bit greasy. 

I have no experience with the \"fresh\" seafood here so cannot comment.

They were also out of ribs the day I was there. Not sure how a BBQ place runs out of ribs??"}
{"text":"BEST seafood in AZ I had I pound of softshell crab and 1 pound of lobster.  I had the garlic and mild spice.  It was so delicious. I had Ben as my server he was awesome and my 2 year old kept taking my bib and he continued to Bring me one as well as tie it as my hands were full. My drink was never empty and he cleaned off my table all threw my meal and i totally appreciate that. The staff was very helpful, kind and very attentive. I will be back thanks for an amazing meal."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Poor customer service and poor communication between employees. Felt completely neglected. Be warned."}
{"text":"So I've been hearing (and reading reviews) about this place and decided it was time to check it out!  We chose a Tuesday since I've been reading about the horror story wait times on the weekend.  Tuesday, 6:30pm, no wait for a table.  Ryan was our server and even though it was busy, he did a great job of explaining the menu and what to expect.  We ordered the snow crab and shrimp with sausage and corn with Trifecta seasoning.  The crab I was blown away by, I could eat that and the sausage every day for the rest of my life!  The shrimp and corn were a little overcooked for my liking.  This is messy eating, e.g. there is a sink in the dining room to wash up at after your meal..and it is loud..with a siren for birthdays going off every 15 minutes or so..so I would recc for the food and with a group, definitely not for a first date..lol."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant 6x and thought it was outstanding 4x . The food has been consistently good and we love that the restaurant is kid friendly . The service was a 10 during our 1st 4 visits but has dramatically changed .  The service has been incredibly slow and waiters/waitresses now lack the enthusiasm that they once had when the restaurant opened . Our table didn't cleared off and we waited a long time to get the check."}
{"text":"Only my first time. Good enough to go back & try something else. Shrimp po'boy was very good by shrimp sandwich standards but failed as a po'boy. Po'boys are not to be fancy sandwiches, hence the term \"Poor Boy\". I'm still trying to find a good po'boy without all the fancy additions & spins everyone tries to put to it. But anyway the soft shell crab basket was pretty good and the prices were decent. Will definitely be back to explore more of the menu."}
{"text":"Well this was fun !! Our party of eleven had a blast.

I loved the concept- you get your choice of seafood (and be prepared to choose) because there's a lot to choose from. How about shrimp, crawfish, mussels, clams, salmon, lobster, and if you're feeling crabby there are four crab variations -snow, Dungeness, King, and Blue.

But you aren't done choosing yet, because you have two big ones next.  How about your sauce (bet you didn't see that one coming). Choose among Kajun, Lemon Pepper, Garlic, Trifecta (those three combined), Traditional Boil, Pacific Rim (coconut curry), and Sweet 'N Tangy.

Last choice is your spice level on a 0-5 level, with 0 being \"Me No Likey Spice\" and 5 being \"Scorching Scorpion -Order at Your Own Risk\".

I ordered Snow Crab with Pacific Rim spice and a Medium Spice Level 2 (Sizzlin').  I added on 4 sausage pieces for $2 and an ear of corn for a buck. 

They toss all of your ingredients in a bag and boil it, then deliver a heaping bag of goodness to your table. By the way, there are no dishes on the table- just use the table long butcher paper for your plates.

I really loved my dinner! The snow crab, corn and sausage slices were delicious, the coconut curry sauce was great, and the 2 spice level was plenty for me.  You do get pretty messy eating this way, so you'll get a lobster bib to look silly in, and there's a big communal sink in the dining room for cleaning up your sloppy self.

Nothing fancy at the Angry Crab -it's a big open dining room and very casual. Lots of TVs showing sports, lots of friendly servers, and a big bar in the middle of the room. If it's your birthday, they blare a really loud siren and yell out Happy Birthday.  

If seafood ain't your bag, they sell burgers, and dinner plates, and BBQ choices.

We had a terrific night at the Angry Crab."}
{"text":"The service was poor, the food was nothing special and the manager was extremely rude! Two sandwiches came after other people were done eating. We tried speaking to mgmt several times and he came to our table and basically told me to shut up and let him talk! We sent some food back because it was burnt and over cooked. When I finally got my poboy it was not at all how the waitress described! I sent it back once cuz it was burnt black. Not really sure, but after eating it I got sick for 24 hrs...can't help but wonder if they put something in it because they were tired of all the complaints from our group?? Will NEVER go back here again, as they really didn't seem to care. Pappadeaux is well worth the trip, and MUCH better seafood and service!!"}
{"text":"This place is spectacular particularly because it is able to pull the concept and food off in a land locked state.

Angry crab is a restaurant that serves Louisiana style cuisine comprised of boiled seafood in creole/Cajun seasoning. While you can order seafood sandwiches or fried baskets, they are known for their boiled bags. The way it works is you select the type of seafood (ie shrimp, crayfish, blue crab, lobster, catfish, king crab) you'd like by the pound. Then you select the type of seasoning and the level of spicyness. You can add corn on the cob, sausage, or potato for a little extra. Google slow country boil if you want pictures and details on this style of cooking. We ordered boil bags of shrimp and the dungess crab with sausage. The crab was amazing with lots of crab meat and while the shrimp wasn't as exciting, it was still fresh and delicious. The two spices trifecta and old fashioned boil were equally great. The trifecta is garlic heavy and the old fashioned boil is spicy. I'd recommend taking the heat level easy, especially if you're ordering the old fashion boil. We also got a dozen oysters. While they're not the best I've ever had (I'm from MD), they were fresh and huge. The fried shrimp basket with BBQ beans and sweet potato fries were also good but not as good as the boil bags.

Service was outstanding. Waters were refilled constantly and our waitress was attentive despite how busy it was in a Tuesday night. We had to wait 20 minutes for a table of 4 around 6:30pm. It sounds like the wait can get pretty long and I believe it based on how crowded it was on a Tuesday. 

I'd recommend asking for crab tools and gloves if you're going for the boil bags. They make your life so much easier!"}
{"text":"A bunch of us Raider fans stopped in here after the convention. We were seated almost instantly, and Destiny our server was great. Two of us ordered the dungeness crab. The flavor was just right. Only thing we didn't like was, the crab came whole and uncleaned. Caught us off guard, because most places crack and clean it for you. We cracked it open ourselves, cleaned and rinsed the crabs ourselves, came back to table and dipped them back in the yummy bag of sauce. i'm so not a diva, but i was too far away from home to be the ONE to get sick :/...Any who, I guess Destiny noticed, and told her manager Nate (who was awesome, and understanding), he came over and we explained the situation, and he assured us that it was okay to eat, and even laughed with us a bit."}
{"text":"Went for the first time...giving a 4 because my partner loved her crab and everyone around us seemed to be enjoying their bags of food. I ordered shrimp with garlic sauce. Was delicious but I just don't like having to peel my shrimp...too much work and then to take out the poop, which we watched everyone just peeling and popping them in their mouths. Googled and l learned it was ok to eat when cooked but not for this girl. I eventually ordered the cod plate and was extremely pleased! Not greasy in the least and the fries were done perfectly! Neither of us cared for the slaw or potato salad. Overall a good experience and service was fine...we never did get water refills though."}
{"text":"Excellent boiled seafood by the pound. Choice you sauce and spice. You can add corn, potatoes, sausage. Good selection of beers. The place is really GREAT"}
{"text":"So I lost my crawfish virginity. Decided I was glad I ordered shrimp, mainly because I liked the taste better.  I also split an order of crab.  A group is the best way to go here because that is the atmosphere created by everybody digging in with their hands and making a mess.  The food was great the service was great and they had Kiltlifter on tap. I not only want more of that shrimp, there are several other things I want to try on the menu."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now.  Being in groups I have gotten to try several different items.  All were OK most were very good.  Service has always been really good.  It stays busy, at least when I have been there, which leads to a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place is so good. It is my ultimate MUST go-to place in Phoenix. A friend of mine is very close with the owner, so I came here during a business meeting when she insisted. BUT when those 2 lbs (excessive amount btw) of King Crab was plopped on the table with potatoes, sausage, and corn - I was changed. Converted. Reborn. 

I don't care how fancy you are. Roll up your sleeves (DO NOT WEAR WHITE), order the \"trifecta\", use the rock to smash the crab shell and DO YOUR AMERICAN DUTY AND SHOVE YOUR FACE WITH THAT GLORIOUS SEAFOOD. 

... You're welcome."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went here about a month ago. What an experience! We've done similar crab houses on the east coast, and love having one here! One note- in future, I'll ask for a bit lighter seasoning in the bags. But it was still tasty!"}
{"text":"Been wanting some snow crab legs for a while so grabbed a friend and off we went to Angry Crab. It was a Sunday evening and even though there was a wait for tables we just headed for seats at the bar.

I already knew what I wanted, a pound a snow crab legs, trifecta with some red potatoes tossed into it. I normally have at Level 4, I love the heat but this time I went level 3, which still had a nice punch of heat, just milder, loved it!! Just what I was craving! Also ordered some hush puppies to share, and those too were a hit! My friend got a pound of shrimp, and he enjoyed them as well.

Even though the bar was crazy busy, service was fast and friendly. This was my 1st time to the Ahwatukee location, and set up is just like the others, even with the opened sink for you to use after eating.

Another great meal at Angry Crab, one day I'll try the bbq haha."}
{"text":"Met up with some friends to get down and dirty with them!  What? Down and dirty?  That's right, it's a crab boil, its messy, it's saucy, and you get very dirty! But don't worry they have a washing station nearby so you can clean up quick like.

It was my 1st experience with a crab boil ever, so I leaned on friend's advice on which way to go, I knew I wanted Snow Crab and with great help I went with the trifecta level 2, now this had some great flavor man it was delish, but next time I think I will kick it up a bit and try the heat level 3.

It was one pound of Snow Crab at market price, which at that time was 15 bucks, honestly that's not bad at all if you think about how much a good meal would cost you elsewhere.  The Snow Crab was cooked perfectly, it was so juicy and tender I was very sad to see I ate it all it was that good!

I also added an order of hush puppies, that was some fried up goodness right there and tried out there bbq beans, those were not the most pretties to look at but it made up in flavor for sure, before I knew it. it was gone.

The Angry Crab was a great dinner choice, look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"A bit too greasy for me.  There were only two of us and I specifically asked the waiter about what I should order and if it was too much or just enough.  We ended up ordering too much food and you can't really \"take cooked shrimp, raw oyster and mussels home\".  The head-on shrimp was a little raw.  I typically love sweet shrimp, but this was a little too slimy for me.  I guess I'm not into the huge portion type places.  Bloody mary was pretty tasty, however.  But I don't think I'll return here.  Not my kind of place."}
{"text":"yoooo first off the chicken tenders are great. comes with too many cajun fries, which is awesome and theyre delicious... and a side of coleslaw, something else i wouldnt eat so i forgot, and bbq baked beans. i got the beans, they were delicious. chicken was delicious too. four stars cuz the ranch was weird, id go 4.7 but i can't. someone who likes seafood and gives a 5 will balance me out here. im gonna bring friends who like seafood here. i like the place especially because the chicken didnt taste fishy like at other places where they fry chicken and fish in the same oil. good stuff"}
{"text":"This place is a great experience.  Delicious messy seafood that you eat with your hands what can be better?  The trifecta sauce gives you a delicious Cajun experience without being too hot for your palette.  The fried clams for an appetizer absolutely delicious. A little on the expensive side for what you get but very difficult to duplicate it home unless you're from Louisiana.  Always really busy around lunchtime and dinner time so try to go in the mid afternoon it is a much better and less crowded experience.  A crowded restaurant means it's a good restaurant!"}
{"text":"I am from the east coast, and what can I say other than FINALLY! A great seafood restaurant with a great atmosphere, and really good seafood. I look forward to going back and trying something new!"}
{"text":"I came here for a group of 25ppl for a bday celebration.  We had a great time and fun!  The wait staff was friendly and pretty good to making sure all of us got our stuff right.  I am not a shell seafood fan, so I opted out to try their BBQ.  I took the brisket sandwich.  It was ok!  The fries were good.  The sauces were good.  I guess I should have ordered the fish instead."}
{"text":"This place offers really cool concept for dining experience. You choose seafood, sauce, spicy level, and any addition. And if you do take out they pack in this individual industrial strength plastic bag (no mess). 

Food is really awesome...watch out for the spice though, I still have burning sensation in my mouth. The shrimp I had were huge and fresh. Sausage were spicy, so if you set the spice level high you have dealt spicy meal to deal with. 

They have good selection of beers (full bar)."}
{"text":"I don't want to overhype this place for anybody, but I thought the food was pretty good enough for me to return. I've eaten a lot of seafood in New England and I thought this place served some pretty fresh tasting seafood for us being landlocked in this here desert. 

I had the alligator basket, my father in law had the shrimp, and my partner had the king crab bucket. My alligator basket was very crispy and the batter was flavorful, the fries were my favorite! Lawd yes, they came out very crispy, were homemade, and were highly seasoned without being overkill. I had some of the king crab and it was super fresh, sweet, and there was a ton of it. That garlic butter sauce we ordered over it was so good, it wasn't just some afterthought with mediocre butter sauce. The butter had a very nice clarity. The fried shrimp were huge and there was definitely more shrimp than batter, I hate that when that happens.  

The decor and restaurant itself is a very nice place to bring your family, it has a very relaxed chill vibe. It's one of those places that encourages writing on the walls by patrons, so if this is not your thing you probably would not like this atmosphere. I'm not a big fan but I also don't really care. The service was okay until the server warmed up some more and then was very nice. They have several craft beers, regular mixed drinks, and domestics. The bartender also came by to see if we needed any more alcohol which is a plus in my book! I don't eat seafood that often here in AZ, but when I am in the mood I would return here."}
{"text":"So another great get together with family and friends at this restaurant! Had ourselves
A little reunion of lifelong friends growing up in Tempe! Service was spot on!  15 total in our party and beer was kept full and orders came out steady and hot! We all ordered an array of items! The party was thoroughly impressed with service and food! Looking to possibly set a date for another little Pre High School reunion at Angry Crab Shack! Thanks Angry Crab Shack for a job well done! We all shall return!"}
{"text":"Whoa!!!! What can you say about Freshest Cajun Boil Seafood in town and WHAT? BBQ!!!!! Chef Jason Lopez has got his BBQ down solid!!!! My suggestion is to take in a bit of the both lil' seafood and lil' BBQ. Trifecta is the way to go on the Seafood and for the BBQ all of it is good but its a must to order the ACQ and Cajun Dijon on the side because you gotta taste the BBQ Plain first, then with a bit of the ACQ sauce, then a bit of the Dijon and last but not least mix a little ACQ & Dijon! WOWERZ! You'll love the service the atmosphere and the food! Oh and almost forgot if you like a little cocktail or beer with your meal it must try the Dixie Peach and/or Abita Beer Purple Haze! Yum!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to the other two locations and love it! Snow Crab Legs are the largest I have seen. Looking forward to many nights of seafood at the new Tukee location."}
{"text":"If I could rate this place a quarter star I would . And that quarter star is for the reception who seated us very quickly. But after that .. there is no service whatsoever. We .. my husband, our friend and I ... sat down for 15 mins with no service..eventually  my hubby successfully waved one of the waiter down.. and order us 3 bottles of beer.. 20 mins pass ... our beer never arrived .. We felt like we were invisible. We decided to get up and left. At the exit .. we told the reception what had happened and we were walking out. She said she was sorry. And that was it ... NO ONE WANNA MAKE IT RIGHT!!!!
The restaurant was not that crowded. It's was Tuesday night at 6pm. We walk out at 6:40 pm with the worst experience."}
{"text":"So I ordered takeout of steamed Maryland Blue Crabs.  After living in Maryland for 10 years, I became addicted to them. We had a crab feast every weekend when they were in season, sitting down at a picnic table covered with newspaper and Old Bay seasoning.  I have missed it terribly so was really excited to see this on the menu there.  Note to self, go in to something new with lower expectations.  I ONLY ordered six crabs as a test to see whether it would be worth getting a couple bushels for a crab feast at my house.  Anyway, out of six crabs, four had inedible meat, with the consistency of mashed potatoes.  I wondered whether it was the cooking method or....something else.  From the crabtips.com website (and others) I found explanations like this, \"You do not want to cook a dead blue crab. There are many reasons you do not want to cook a dead blue crab. A blue crab will spoil almost instantly and it will taste bad or the meat will be really mushy when cooked.\"  Also having been cooked, frozen and re-steamed can result in this mushy meat.  Very disappointed but again with the expectations....I've never been able to find good blue crab since I've moved out west.  Perhaps it's just not meant to be unless you are going to a four-star restaurant.  I'm giving two stars instead of one because the person who took my order and the bartender who delivered it were super friendly.  He had carefully packaged my order and said he hoped I would be back to try some of their other seafood options (I also die for raw oysters).  Hopefully this review will help them either take better care with seasonal items that have to be shipped across the country, OR, I'll have helped someone else from being as disappointed as I was.  Happy Crab Eating Y'all!!"}
{"text":"I googled yelp for a Seahawks restaurant in Phoenix for the Super Bowl.  This restaurant popped up and I asked if they were doing something for the Super bowl.  The person who answered said no they were not so I explained why I was asking.  She said that she is a Patriots fan so definitely nothing for the Hawks.  I don't know about the food, but not welcoming."}
{"text":"Warm beer?? Hush puppies are fried bread balls that suck! Wings were like shake and bake nasty! Got up and left! Didn't order the food! Whoever says this place is good has no taste buds and needs to stick to fast food 99 cent menu"}
{"text":"Loved our crab and the experience! I had Dungeness crab, my daughter had snow crab, my son had king crab and mussels which all were awesome!  We even liked the fried gator!  Lots of food which you eat in clam bake style, with your hands!  Great service and great atmosphere.  I hear it can get busy, but if you plan it right you can get right in.   Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"We tried this spot out for the first time last night. They are doing it the right way for sure. The crab was big and delicious, seasoning was awesome too. Service was great too. The witch of a woman at the table next to us must have never eaten crab before and she complained about literally everything, right down to the shells being too hard. Anyways our server took it with a smile like a pro, she didn't skip a beat meanwhile I was about ready to have her kicked out. Anyways keep it up angry crab, you're doing great."}
{"text":"I'm beginning to this this restaurant location is cursed--just one mediocre place after another.  We were so excited to see The Angry Crab open up!  My husband and I visited on Friday night about 5:45 with my mother.

We waited only a few minutes for a table, and our drink orders arrived right away.  That was pretty much the last good thing that happened for the next 90 minutes as we waited...and waited...and waited.

We didn't feel like dealing with heads and guts, so we ordered fry baskets and a po' boy wrap.  Mom's side order of cole slaw arrived immediately, and proceeded to sit for the next 45 minutes, growing less appetizing by the second as she waited for the rest of her meal.

My cod basket was next to make an appearance--minus the side of garlic sauce I ordered (the first time that showed up was on the bill).  Fifteen or twenty minutes later, my husband's crab basket reached the table, while my mother continued to wait.  I got up and asked to speak with a manager, who saw to it that she received her wrap, fresh hot cajun fries, and fresh cole slaw.  By then, however, it was just too late to make a difference.

Fair food, wretched service...and the curse lives on!  We'll give them a few weeks and give them one more chance to see if they got their act together."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!!! It's definitely our go to for fresh and delicious Cajun seafood. My favorite dish is 1 lb of shrimp or king crab with the trifecta sauce, it's garlicky, spicy and flavorful. The first time I visited I made the rookie mistake of getting a hot spice level. I think I used half of the napkins on the roll to wipe my nose and tears. I have wised up and now  the medium spice is my go to. I love that you can add vegetables, potatoes and sausage to any order. It's a get messy and great food kind of establishment."}
{"text":"4 times and counting...whether it's been an issue with the food or service, it's just not been good. 

Over the past yr or yr and a half, the quality of this restaurant has gone down to what is unrecognizable from before.  We used to eat here once or twice a wk, and that's not an exaggeration. I used to live within walking distance. Coming from SoCal, this was reminiscent of my go-to seafood place in OC. I could get a relatively good resemblance of what I'd get back home (think Boiling Crab) without having to travel. 

So, what happened?!

I can't really say that they just no longer care about this location in favor of their newer locations (even though that's what I suspect)  but they're sorely lacking in almost all aspects of the business. Their server turnover is ridiculous,  their food quality is inconsistent and their management leaves much to be desired.  I've worked in the restaurant industry both as a server and in management for as long as I can remember, so to say that I'm lenient towards service and food is an understatement. I can sympathize with all service industry people for when things go poorly with little to no control over the situation. But this last time not only angers me, it makes me sad. 

My BF & I have been starving since we woke up this morning at 9. He's slightly hungover and still tired. It's been months since we've tried Angry Crab. And though the last experience wasn't ideal (or even pleasant) we were willing to give it another try. Def a decision made more due to nostalgia than the actual experiences of late. We procrastinated all morning just so we could wait for the restaurant to open. We drove 20 mins into Mesa,  even though a similar restaurant is in walking distance of our home.  We were some of the first people there.

We order our food (3 lbs of seafood with lots of extras). Our server is new and somewhat slow, but sweet and you can clearly see she is trying.  I had to ask for the usual offerings (salt/pepper, lime, and gloves) but I didn't mind. I'm just happy to be there and excited about the food.  My bf specifically asks for the sauce to be thick since the past few times we've been,  they've given us slightly flavored oil water. Everything is going well.  Food comes out all at the same time. Onion rings are great, not burnt like the last time we were there. The shrimp & mussels are ok.  The sauce still is lacking in spice, heat and consistency but it's not watery so that's still a win.

I'm thinking to myself that things are finally getting back to normal and maybe we can start coming back here regularly. But no. Oh how I was wrong. One of my favorite parts of the meal usually is the extra potato I add to the bag. It sits there soaking up all the saucey goodness. We are about halfway through our meal, I having eaten almost nothing but the onion rings, and I bite into the potato. Its rotten. Like \"I'm about to gag and throw up everything I've just eaten\" rotten. I spit what I have in my mouth into the trash bucket and show my bf. Half the potato is purple/black, the texture is wrong, and the taste is horrid. My bf is appalled, but also finds it kind of funny because really,  only this would happen to me. We show the server the potato and she seems surprised. She slightly apologizes, asks if I'd like a replacement (to which I decline) and says she'll tell a manager and take it off the bill. Ok, standard practice for any restaurant.  

I try to continue eating my meal but the rotten potato is all I can think about.  I stew. Its been 10 mins since informing the waitress and Ive yet to be acknowledged by the manager. He'll come over and apologize for my bad experience, right?  The manager acknowledging that the restaurant served me rotten food is probably the right thing to do, right? A simple apology to appease the unease isnt that difficult. 20 mins go by and I've spent the last 10 mins peeling shrimp for my bf and finishing off the only thing left that's palatable to me, the onion rings. At this point the ire is building and I'm just ready to leave.  We ask for the check, a to-go bag for the 1 1/2 lbs of seafood we have left, and get ready to leave. I pay, leave a better tip than I should have since it was not representative of the meal i just had (mostly because  the server isn't really to blame) and write a note for the server and management. Even managers at places like Denny's will come by to address an issue. 

I am now livid. Not even a simple,  \"we're sorry\" from anyone other than the server.  I get to the car, call the restaurant to talk to a manager because I really can't believe that it is not common policy for a manager to address an issue with the food. I speak with a manager and explain why I'm disappointed in the whole situation.  He states that he will investigate what happened and why the manager on duty never came by. He half heartedly offered an apology after I demanded one. 

It's pretty simple though,  it's because you guys stopped caring..."}
{"text":"First time in since I have been hearing rave reviews from friends and co-workers.  Definitely a new favorite and we will be back!  Fresh and well prepared...Nice and spicy just the way we liked it.  Ordered both the Snow and King crab, shrimp and mussels with the level 3 trifecta blend.  Hush puppies were great, too!"}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite place to eat out. Love the laid back environment,  the beers on tap and of course,  the food! Always order a pound of shrimp with garlic and cajun medium spice. I also order a side of rice to soak up all that yummy butter. Hate that they charge for the butter on the side, lol!"}
{"text":"I paid for a 2.7 lb lobster and it had very little meat. Not even a quarter of a lb. Paid over $110 for a $40 meal. The little meat I had was good. Lol"}
{"text":"Hubby comes home from errand running  and informs me that he wants to go out for some raw oysters. Not so easy to find if you are out here on the west side! I stumbled across Angry Crab Shack on yelp and we hopped in the car for an adventure. Everyone always says they have them and when you arrive they're out.  We arrived around 4:30 thinking about having a half dozen and a cocktail. We were immediately impressed with the fun, casual up beat atmosphere! We decided to sit at the bar as we were not going to be there long. Kat our bartender was amazing!! She explained the whole menu in a nut shell and kept us laughing with her great personality.  She had us convinced with ice cold drinks and tempting menu descriptions to try a pound of the Shrimp with the medium trifecta sauce (I like heat but not burning) and 1 dozen of both kinds of oysters. Needless to say the seafood was absolutely hot and amazing. I would highly recommend the Trifecta sauce at which ever heat level you like. The oysters were excellent and fresh and my husband ended up ordering more, so did the guy at the bar next to us!  Its messy and they don't use plates so don't expect fancy however, if you're looking for great seafood in the desert this is your stop. They are serious about seafood and it is delicious. The variety is extensive and the place was buzzing busy on a Wednesday at 6pm.  This place has it by a mile over Hot and Juicy at Westgate! If you are looking for the white table cloth service I suggest Scottsdale although having tried that option at 4 times the cost I would rather eat here where the seafood is the star.  We will be bringing at least a dozen or so of our friends and I really hope to find Kat at the bar again! She was our first introduction and made the whole experience wonderful."}
{"text":"Visited for dinner tonight.  After two co-workers raved about this place I needed to try it for myself.  Based on the recommendation from the waiter I opted for the shrimp with the trifecta sauce and mild heat.  It didn't disappoint.   My wife had Dungeness crab and my son opted for the ribs w/Mac N Cheese.  The crab and shrimp were boiled to perfection.  The ribs had an excellent smokey flavor and the Mac n Cheese was a special recipe on an old favorite.  With the exception of my son we opted for water and got a bill for $79.  Not bad for fresh seafood in the middle of the desert.

This is CASUAL dining experience.  Expect to have a splattering of sauce, best case.  The wash basin nearby came in handy for clean-up.  Received excellent service from all staff.

Angry Crab Shack is not some place I would go on a regular basis but it is nice change of pace."}
{"text":"The serves was terrible. The food was ok until I got home and had food poisoning. I would never go here again..."}
{"text":"I have never, ever, been treated so badly in a restaurant in my life. 
 I came in with my girlfriend for dinner last night. We sat down immediately (not that busy) and proceeded to wait 15 minutes for someone to come up to us. My girlfriend finally goes to the bathroom, and our server decides that this is the perfect time to come up and get our order. She sits back down, we order 1 lb of shrimp and 1 lb of blue crab. BOTH SPICY 1. I ask for a bib because mine was broken. In mid sentence, asking for gloves and a cracker as well, my server is already gone. Wait 5 minutes of hot food sitting in front of us, to get up and get the bib, gloves and cracker myself. I then try the (wimpy) spicy 1 shrimp. I got a spicy 3 last time and this was clearly a 5. Too spicy. Look for our server, nowhere to be found. So I tell a busboy, \"hey sorry we ordered a spicy 1 and this is way too hot\" they go back in the kitchen, come back out and tell me that I'm wrong and it's a 1. I'm a sous chef. I have a sriracha tattoo on my arm. I like spice. This was too spicy. My girlfriend does not like spice. We then got our server, finally. He then told me I was a wimp and should have gotten a 0. At this point, I am furious. He says he'll get his manager. She comes out, maybe not aware of how mad I was already, and made a joke that I looked so sweaty it must be super hot. Again, being made fun of. The sausage in the crab was cold and undercooked. Was told I was wrong about that as well. The manager chased us out to give us a $50 gift card so I wouldn't write this review. Guess what."}
{"text":"Customer service was ok. Not a lot of food for an expensive price. I pretty much left hungry"}
{"text":"Took my family for a dinner out and experienced the worst kitchen service I have seen in 2 years.  First off, we waited an hour outside to find out they \"lost\" us, even tho my wife watched them enter it into to the tablet.  Then after we finally got served, the bar service took 15 minutes to get a beer, then the meal came out one plate at a time.  30 minutes after the first plate, the kids mac and cheese was delivered... I complained to the manager, which he shrugged off as a busy Friday.   He knocked of $10 off the bill.  After all this, the beans that belonged to the very first plate that came out 45 minutes beforehand.  The worst experience I have had in Phoenix.. and a great disappointment from the host, manager, and kitchen.  The waitress Tammy was a rock-star and took my frustration, even tho I know it was not her fault.  I am sorry she has to work in such a mess.  McDonald's would have been more enjoyable and a better experience.  Thanks Angry Crab Shack!"}
{"text":"If you don't care about getting dirty while you eat like a barbarian than this is the place for you. The seafood here is amazing! The Cajun sauces are hot and taste great! One of the best places for crab."}
{"text":"Came here because I was recommended by a friend. Not at all disappointed.

Service was great, food was tasty, prices were good.

Beef brisket was perfect. Fresh. Good portions.
Calamari tasted authentic. Not like fake breaded calamari where you can't taste the fish.

We also had the trifecta flavored shrimp and lobster. Man was it good. Really messy, but an overall wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in and was really hungry for some good Brisket. Well, I was not disappointed!!! I started with the charred oysters, which were off the hook, and jumped into a plate of brisket with baked beans.  It was super tasty and tender and didn't even need any sauce although I managed to put a huge dent in my sauce cup. I think it was the best brisket I have ever had and I have had brisket all over the USA.  Vann, was an excellent server and was very accomodating and friendly.  I felt welcome and will return mostly because of his excellent service to me. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Took family on a dinner night.  Great family style food.  Or for one person.  Pricy but bomb"}
{"text":"Our first time here... we're from San Diego and love our seafood equally as much as BBQ, therefore we couldn't resist eating here and let me tell you, This was the best combination and not the place to pass up. 
We had a pound of king crab, the pulled pork sammy, sides were sweet potato frys, mac n cheese (so bomb), bbq beans, cat fish with cajon frys, and to top it all off this amazing red velvet cheese cake. Everything was mouth watering good.. by the end of our meal we had order an extra pound of king crab and the mac also to go... telling you all, it's so good!!! Crab seasoning is on point and the mac so cheesey!!

Our server was Jeff-- thank you so much for your great customer service and suggestions on places to check out and routes to make the most while traveling to Sedona/Grand Canyon. He really took care of us! Thank you Jeff! 
  
....can't type Any more as I drive back to AZ just for this meal!! Seriously, it's that good!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We went on a Saturday night and were told it would be about 30 minutes and we were happy to wait. About 15 minutes later our table was ready! Good service. The food was amazing!! Get the trifecta... I was hesitant at first but the server highly recommended it. I wasn't sure about the lemon pepper but trust me... it all makes a heavenly combo. The spice levels are no joke... they can get HOT! Especially after eating a pound of shrimp. They have shrimp with the head on for $11 or for $3 more head off shrimp which is what I went for. I was very pleased with this decision because you get more shrimp and you don't have to handle the heads. You'll be a complete mess afterward and it will take multiple hand washing attempts before it all comes off. It truly was a great experience and we are already planning our next visit."}
{"text":"We LOVE this location of the Angry Crab. Always consistently great! I think it is odd that someone would compare the food at Angry Crab to Joe's Crab Shack - which is not even in the same realm. Angry Crab is like being in Louisiana. We love to do crab boils at home but this is so much more convenient. The wait staff is awesome! Even if they are busy they move folks along quickly."}
{"text":"Bring your eating close, very casual/sports bar-ish! The atmosphere is live and relaxed. The food was good and plentiful. We had the king crab which lived up to its name King! Very big and meaty legs. We also had the shrimp Po boy which was flavorful. Then comes the peel and eat shrimp, not my thing I can't peel heads and legs off big shrimp filled with feces. Can't do it! The spice level we chose the Cajun spice #2 which was plenty spicy. Over all experience definitely worth a visit. People eating in gloves hilarious!!!!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the wait staff and the food here. I went with my girlfriend and then took my boyfriend back. They suggested the spices since I hadn't been here before and we added sausages, corn, potato to the bag with our meat choice. Then we got oysters too and they were great!"}
{"text":"Went there last night with the family. We ordered shrimp, snow crab. Don't mind head on but do not like shrimp not cleaned, devained. Sauce was okay,  had kajun on all of it. The srimp were way over cooked, rubber texture. The crab was also over cooked, mear was dry with no moisture.  
Had to sit next to that obnoxious siren...why have that dang thing.  
When the check came I was in the process of filling out the tip and signing my name, all of a sudden the paper that acts as a table cloth was being rolled up!  Wait for me to finish before you rudely try to get us to leave!
 Won't be back.  Very little flavor."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service sucked. Literally had to ask for everything. What's the deal with these meek, quiet guys waiting in tables and thinking if I take your order it's all good? Swings by once and that's it, here is your tab!"}
{"text":"Super fun place to eat. It's loud in there you are warned!  
Food is great. Large amounts of it too! 
Please to get messy and full. 
Enjoy it and have fun!"}
{"text":"The service was top notch and the food was effing amazing! You will get dirty. 10 times better than Joe's Crab Shack... and cheaper"}
{"text":"Went here to try something new for seafood.  It was definitely a good experience (MUCH better than Joe's Crab-shack).  Fun festive atmosphere with attentive wait staff.  My wife and I each got 1lb of crab (snow and king) with trifecta sauce.  Very good sized and fresh crab.  Also got the hush puppies (which were nothing special).  Overall pretty pleased.  One thing I would have liked would be the ability to mix the bags up and get in 1/2lb increments so that we could have tried more.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This review is for the service....Most of the time when we come here the service is excellent!!! However tonight the service was lackluster and multiple times the service staff was just standing around...we had to ask for our order to be taken...ask for refills on our drinks...just not a pleasant evening..."}
{"text":"FRESH seafood. Excellent food and portions. Really cool environment.  Fast, polite service.  Found on Yelp and was surprised that it was so good.  East-coasters....they have Chesapeake Bay blue crabs!"}
{"text":"The best in town ... forget red lobster ,forget Joe crab shack  ..don't waste your money on them places

You want the best seafood ,you come to the best ANGRY CRABS ..
OH and our server MADDIE was great!!!!
Good service"}
{"text":"Ask for Will he is the best. My girl friend and I love this place for a messy date night. We switch up the food each time."}
{"text":"Great place for shellfish and bbq, love the corn and potatoes. Always great for an evening of food and friends!"}
{"text":"Visited Thanksgiving weekend and couldn't be happier.  Susanne our server was great, so friendly and quick to get our order out.  Food was tasty and filling.  Definitely coming back on my next trip out to AZ."}
{"text":"Great food. My 1lb shrimp was delicious.  It wasn't over cooked. We came here to celebrate a birthday and we all enjoyed our food. I was just a slight disappointed on my pecan pie. It wasn't what I was expecting.  The pie came cold. But besides the point my family and I really enjoyed our experience and atmosphere."}
{"text":"We took our son for his 37 birthday last July, and loved it. Gave it a great review then. My family took me for my birthday this month. Loved it ! Not only did we get the same great waitress, we got the same good service and food. Had the Alaskan King crabs super spicy, and loved every morsel. Great environment, fun for all."}
{"text":"The food here is perfect, if you're in the mood for a seafood boil! Be prepared to get a little messy, as silverware isn't really a thing here. Not for first dates or pre-show dinners. But a good time for sure. The Kajun bloody mary is pretty good too! The only thing I wish was different is that I could order by the 1/2 pound and combine a couple of the shellfish!"}
{"text":"Ordered to go just now got my food. Pulled pork sammich is dry and pretty bland. Fries are amazing like always thought. Pretty eh about my order. Whatever it's food."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed it!  I don't like spicy, so the server (who was awesome) directed me towards what would be good for me based on my taste. The oysters and crab were delicious. I will be back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! YOU DONT EVEN NEED BUTTER for your crab legs! Better than Joe's Crab Shack and cheaper by about $10... I usually get a pound of king crab($24) with trifecta and their spice runs hot so on the scale I usually get level 2 spice...I like the atmosphere, it gets busy though which I'm not surprised!"}
{"text":"This place is a favorite in my family! The service is great, our food always arrives in 10 minutes or less and is always so fresh and flavorful. We love the loud atmosphere, as do our kids. 
Tonight we went for dinner again, our server was Alexa (pretty sure that's her name) she was awesome! She made sure to explain everything to us, and double checked everything was good constantly. She has exceptional customer service skills, she kept making sure my daughters were satisfied with everything. When she took our drink orders she added that if we needed anything like warm water (to warm milk in bottles) or a warm rag to clean them up, just to let her know what we needed to accommodate them. I should add that my daughters were also very fond of her.
My kids love eating here! It is such a fun and loud environment, and they sure do love being loud and having fun! Going to dinner is usually such a hassle with two little divas under 3, but this place makes dining with children so easy. And to top it off great prices!
So to wrap this up in my opinion the service and food both were 5 stars. We will definately continue coming here for a delicious and fun family dinner!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. AJ was our server and he was extremely entertaining, attentive and knowledgeable. I had the muscles and sausage, my wife had brisket and pulled pork. We shared the hush puppies. Everything was so delicious. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Meh. Ordered traditional boil medium spice with shrimp, 1 potato, and sausage. Also got an order of hush puppies to start. Hush puppies were mediocre. Shrimp was rubbery and tasted muddy. The potato was very bland. Nothing tasted spicy to me. Waiter screwed up and wrote down corn instead of sausage, corn was ok, sad i didn't get to try the sausage though. Service was ok considering how busy it was (regular refills, etc.). But overall not an experience I'd care to repeat."}
{"text":"I was a little intimidated to eat at this place as I have never eaten a whole shrimp before and had no clue where to begin. Our waitress was happy to put on some gloves and show me how to peel the shrimp.  I'm still a novice but the payoff was well worth it!  I ordered the 1 lb. shrimp in Trifecta sauce, no spice, and it was absolutely delicious and fresh.  Husband ordered the alligator which was super tasty as well.  

The whole experience was fun- your paper tablecloth is your dinner plate and your hands are the utensils.  They give you a bib and from there you start digging in.  A waiter came around to each table to show off one of the Dungeness crabs, which my toddler enjoyed.  Plus, they give a 10% off discount to law enforcement, which is very much appreciated!  We will be back very soon."}
{"text":"The food was great, wait was a little long but we'll worth it. Steve was our server and made great recommendation.  I will go again! !"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Nice loud place for loud families awesome staff! Gratuity a little high but great service worth every penny! Definitely will go again!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. You're going to get your hands dirty, enjoy!! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with the music, TV sets, & up beat employees.  The menu is simple and prices are excellent for the good eat. I had the pound of shrimp with the trifecta seasoning & it was the perfect blend of seasoning. Definitely recommend! 
ps the wash station is what set it over the top! No need to go to the restroom when you can wash your hands right there."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this place out with my wife. We ordered the crawfish (fresh) boil with the most popular sauce ( a trio ), and fried shrimp with fries. The crawfish were delicious and had just the right amount of spices and flavor. The best part was that the sauce that was left over went awesome with some white rice afterwards. The fried shrimp was also perfect fried and juicy. The Cajun fries were just the right amount of spiciness and taste, while not being overpowering. 

Overall, I will definitely be returning but will try out the shrimp boil instead (crawfish while tasty, doesn't have enough meat for my taste haha)."}
{"text":"Awesome. Went on Saturday at 5. Seated right away. Got there just ahead of the dinner crowd. Enjoyed the catfish and the shrimp. It's loud place, but I enjoyed the excitement of it all. Will be back to broaden my seafood palate. I got the catfish basket. For $9 bucks, I got a big pieces of fish. Lots of fries and an additional side dish. My daughter had a shrimp po'boy. Everything was yummy. 
They will open a location in Ahwatukee soon. I'm very excited about that. Thanks Angry Crab for replacing Pappadeux's on my list of seafood dinner spots."}
{"text":"Pretty amazing seafood! Great flavoring. Good selection. Best cajun seafood in Phoenix metro. Can get a little pricey. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Just went with a group of 12. Fun atmosphere. Food was delicious but messy! There's paper on the table & they supply bibs but be ready to get dirty. Many of us ordered the king crab, which was 3 legs for a pound. A bit pricey but it is king crab! We had the trifecta sauce & made it mild, which was delicious. Have them throw some corn, potatoes & sausage in your bag. I just wish they cracked the crab beforehand- it was actually painful trying to get the meat out of the pokey shell."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!
Had the whole lobster sauce trifecta heat 3 with the corn, sausage , and red potatoes."}
{"text":"Great location for dinner for a group service was awesome and food quality was top notch. It was worth the money not a cheap dinner"}
{"text":"Food was good. Sausage was blah and they should include more than one little potato for what you pay. Will be back though because my bill was messed up 3x!!! My bill was only 22 dollars and my card got charged 45"}
{"text":"Please do not order wings from here. They are God awful and salty and smoky. Place looks great and I'm sure other food is good but don't eat the wings."}
{"text":"I would have to rate this customer service 10 out of 10. Shout out to our waitress Allison!!! The staff were super attentive, and friendly. Our drinks were always topped off and we were consistently checked on.. which was a huge plus! 

Food wise:
We ordered several pounds of shrimp, crawfish, and clams via TRIFECTA FLAVOR (Cajun, garlic, lemon) with couple sides of rice. To be honest the flavors were sort of bland, which required me to request some extra salt and pepper on the side for dipping. The pound of clams came with quite a few empty shells but they were able to bring out  another bag to make up for it. We started off with some onion rings and Cajun fries, which were good. So... I would have to rate this place a 3.5 STARS. Potential for a 4-4.5 if the sauces were more flavorful."}
{"text":"Went with my boyfriend on a Friday day so it wasn't packed. I ordered the 1lb snow crab and he ordered the 1lb shrimp. We also added the extra stuff like corn, potato, and sausage in or sea food bag. We also ordered the calamari strips as an appetizer which was delicious. We both got the trifecta?? In medium. Next time I go I will definitely get the mild. Food was awesome, service was just okay. I believe they all share tips so a bunch of different people come check on you. I definitely want to go back and try the bbq."}
{"text":"Fabulous boiled shrimp. I am from Louisiana so tend to be critical of most seafood restaurants. They have not disappointed. Enjoy their fried catfish also."}
{"text":"excellent crab. our go to place for seafood.  Staff friendly and its a very neighborly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Fun seafood place! Great food and excellent service. We were pleasantly surprised, and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not a fan of peeling and deveining my own shrimp. The trifecta sauce was good but just not my style. The waitress didn't give me low down when I arrived even after she was informed it was my first time there, she sent another employee out to explain the rules of the place. It was only 3:30 pm in the afternoon and 1 other couple in the place so not busy at all!"}
{"text":"I was here with a decent size group recently for a birthday, and it was top notch!! We went for an early dinner(4:00pm) on a Saturday. The restaurant was busy, but now overly crowded. We did not have to wait for a table. 
The food was amazing! I am a  big fan of seafood, and love seafood boils. I personally ordered the crawfish & snow crab legs with the trifecta, and medium spice. I also added the sausage to the crawfish bag. It was all melt in your mouth good! The crawfish were fresh, tasty, and cooked perfectly! The snow crab legs were from frozen(not unusual), but good and meaty. 
I tasted the gumbo my wife ordered and it was very good as well. I am not a guy who likes okra in his gumbo, but they didn't put a lot of it in so that was a bonus for me. 
I also tasted some of the fried alligator and it was excellent as well. 

Everyone in our thought very highly of the food! Personally I may have found a seafood joint favorite in the valley. 

The restaurant is very laid back. The music is loud, but not oppressive to conversation at all.

There are only little things holding me back from giving a full 5 stars. The service was pretty good, and the waitress was attentive. She could have communicated some things a little better. There were some mix-ups with sides, sauces, etc. Some of their beers were discontinued, but still listed on the menu. Minor things yes, but it was a pain.  


Overall though it was GREAT meal, and I guarantee that everyone in the party would eat there again in a heart beat.


Great atmosphere! Cold beer! Great food! Fun!"}
{"text":"Great food, fun environment, friendly service.

My brother raved to me for a while about how good this place is, so I finally visited. I was not disappointed, despite my initial misgivings when I pulled up to the place. It's in a very nondescript building--totally at odds with what's inside the restaurant. It's a nice, casual environment inside the place, with some nice crayon artwork on one side and lots of writing on the walls on the other.

We had a great server. I believe her name was Tierra, and she did a fabulous job from beginning to end! She gave us all the information about the food that we could have possibly wanted, and her recommendations were all spot on. So what did she recommend?

We shared some snow crab legs in the basic boil and some crawfish in the trifecta sauce. We had some corn on the cob, BBQ beans, and hush puppies. Every single bite was fantastic! The snow crab and crawfish all came out hot, tied up in the boil bags. After some lessons from our server about the best ways to get to the meat inside the shells (we weren't pros), we really enjoyed the meat inside. The corn on the cob had some good spice to it, but it was kinda mushy, having been overcooked inside the boil bags. The BBQ beans and hush puppies, on the other hand, were delicious! The BBQ beans had a nice little spiciness to them, and the hush puppies were nice and crunchy on the outside and tender inside. The sauce that comes with the hush puppies pales in comparison to just dipping the hush puppies in the liquids from the boil bag.

After all this eating, my hands were a mess. There's a sink in the main area in which you can wash your hands. The bibs are a nice touch.

I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Everything tasted sweet for some reason. Like the cooks in the back were using sugar on accident instead of salt (I know I've done that). Our crab legs had these little black things all over the place and it was all mixed in with the butter. YUCK!. Their response... \"that's how they come\". Um no. I find that very weird because the many (many) times we've been to Angry Crab I've NEVER seen the crab legs come out like that. The ketchup even tasted weird. Almost as if it were mixed with cocktail sauce? It was so strange. I've never had a bad experience at Angry Crab but for the price you pay, I expect to be happy when I'm paying that much for a meal. I'm going to give them a break for a little while until they figure it out..."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place! It has quickly jumped to the top of my favorite places to eat in the Valley, and my husband and I have been here 3 times in the past 2 months! We are big seafood fans and are so excited to find a place that's fun, delicious and close to home!
Here are a few of my tips-
- Don't wear anything you can't bear to stain...chances are you may be wearing some of your dinner by the end of the night even with the bibs they provide you (totally worth it). 
-Order the charred oysters- TRUST. They are amazing; best oysters I've ever had.
-Trifecta everything. You'll understand that once you go.  
-The Clams are excellent! However our last trip they were sold out (so disappointing). It's not uncommon for them to run out of certain things, so if that's a deal-breaker for you, call ahead before you go! 
-The King Crab is amazing...you get a lot of meat and I find them fun to crack and eat. The Snow Crab is good too, but it's a lot of work for less meat (but less money). Both are great though. 
-The Shrimp is a great value! They are big, flavorful, you can't go wrong for the price. 
-The Lobster I wouldn't recommend. Not that it wasn't good, but remember you're paying in weight here, so at $17 a pound, the lobster that came out was almost 2.5 pounds, that's an almost $50 lobster, and about 1/2 of it you don't eat (the head, guts, shells, legs etc). It's a waste of money in my honest opinion. 
-The drinks are excellent. We like the Mule and the Tropical one... I can't think of the real name. Great beers on tap too. 
-Take advantage of their cheap prices to add a little 1/2 ear of corn ($.75 ea) and 4 generous pieces of sausage ($1.25) to your bags! They have potatoes too. It's a great way to make sure you're full for cheap. 

All in all, great place, fun atmosphere, EXCELLENT food! If you're serious about your seafood fix, don't expect to eat cheap here, but do expect to leave satisfied, mentally wondering as you walk to your car if it's too soon to ask your husband when your next visit will be....  ;)"}
{"text":"Excellent service, great place and they do fish right! Cornmeal not battered. Go see them. Conrad knows customer service"}
{"text":"No joke this place is fantastic !!!! We got king crab, snow crab and shrimp. Honestly pay for the king crab it's 100% worth the extra price. Bartender was Nate he was awesome and very honest about what to order. We got level 3 spice and the house seasoning. Best experience we will be back and frequently. I can't say enough about how great it was and how great our bartender was !!! Keep it up Angry Crab !!"}
{"text":"No clams, no crawfish, no blue crab. We were told mussels were out and yet, a bag of it was brought to our table after they said they didn't have it w/o the corn, potatoes, and sausage we asked for. The shrimp was soooo good. They were huge and juicy. Mostly the only thing salvaging this review. We got the Trifecta level 3, mild. The rest of the food was alright. Not great. My gumbo tasted like Progresso brand beef and vegetable soup. My dad and boyfriend's dishes came with the tiniest sliver of cornbread and for how much their meat dishes were, the portion wasn't great. The calamari was delectible. Other than that, I will never come on a Monday again. They were out of everything."}
{"text":"All the food was great!  We all had something different and we tried each others food and all was yummy! I like that once your meal is cooked they bring it out so it's not sitting at the window.  All four people got their meals within about a four minute window.  Can't wait to go back!!!!! It was a little loud but when your eating with your hands you enjoy the music and the mess you will make!!!"}
{"text":"We've been to this location once before and had a good experience, but tonight was worth an actual review. We ordered 2 lbs of blue crab. 1 lb of snow crab and 1 lb of mussels. The blue crab was over cooked, it was the consistency of mashed potatoes. Our only other experience with them was when we first tried them in Maryland so we figured maybe they just cooked them differently here or they were out of season.

My wife let the manager, Derek, know and he was SO SO kind. He took them off of our check and was so good humored about the whole thing. The food is always great, and everything else was, so we'd highly recommend the place despite our slightly subpar experience tonight, but especially because they took such good care of us! Derek was great, so was the rest of the staff, and of course the food is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Can't say much good things about angry crab, been here twice, first off the service is fine, no complaints there. Ordered 2 Dos Equis draft.. disappointed, it was the most flat draft beer I've ever had, on top of that it wasn't cold. 
Second the garlic, medium seasoning is saucy with no flavor. Nothing special with the seasoning."}
{"text":"Very first time eating here, loved everything. The service the environment. The prices were reasonable and there was so much food. I love the style of causal. Paper plates, paper cups. The bourbon pecan pie is out of this world! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Serendipity!  Mimi is the BEST waitress ever. Her smile is worth the trip!  She patiently explained the menu and told us what she likes. Our food was amazing from the gator nuggets to my daughter's shrimp (with Trifecta 3) and my husband's lobster (with Trifecta 1). But I really scored with the Lobster Roll (not on the menu, YET). We hadn't planned on eating here; we only pulled into the lot to look up directions to another place and decided it was easier to try something new than to turn around. We will be back for more food and fun!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. I almost gave it a 5 star rating. I'll asterisk (*) my reasons below for why I stopped at 4 stars.

The first time knocked it out of the park. I'm from Maryland so I got some blue crab. It's a sad situation that you really can't get decent sized blue crab these days... even at restaurants on the Chesapeake Bay...nothing Angry Crab can do about that. But the blue crabs were good, if a bit tedious. Small crabs are the same amount of work for less payoff. I got shrimp and some snow crab too. It was expensive but totally worth it. I left with a big smile on my face. Thank you Angry Crab.

The second go-round, I got a dungeness crab. They are not as sweet but had I gotten frustrated with how small the blues were last time. WORD TO THE WISE: if you get a dungeness, be certain to immediately remove it from the piping hot bag they bring it in. If you don't, it will continue to cook in the bag and become mushy. Mine did on this visit. So did another's in our party of four. Next time I'll follow my own advice. I'll probably remove the shell immediately as well just to reduce the chance for it to become mushy. In the northwest they throw dungeness crab on ice immediately after cooking for this very reason. Not being a dungeness guy this didn't spring to my mind quick enough to make a difference. (*) I definitely think our waiter should have mentioned removing the crab from the bag. Just a quick comment from him would have saved $70 of crab. We ate it...mushy...kinda nasty.  At first I though I had received a crab they had cooked after it was dead for a while. Then my mistake dawned on me. I blame myself. But that 5th star was riding on the establishment protecting me from my ignorance.

(*) The other detraction from the second visit was our waiter's too-cool-for-school approach to minimal service and general interaction with the table. I don't want to completely call him out. Let's just call him 'K'.

4 Stars may turn to 5 on my next visit.

Happy crabbing."}
{"text":"There is another restaurant in the Valley with a similar concept called Hot & Juicy but I will say that I like Angry Crab Shack & BBQ better because you can choose your spice level whereas at the other establishment \"Hot\" is in the name for a reason."}
{"text":"Fun-delicious-messy-crab-happy place.  Fun birthday celebration."}
{"text":"Took my cousin and his daughter who are visiting from overseas. We all had prawns and our food was delicious.
Eric, our waiter was fun, friendly and professional. A very good experience.
And eating out of plastic bags is so much fun!!"}
{"text":"Hidden in a little strip mall in Tukee, Angry Crab did not disappoint. The unique experience included wearing a bib, eating off a table, and graffiting up some walls. However, the best experience was definitely the food. Our table of two ordered one pound of shrimp, one pound of snow crab legs (both trifecta style and #5 heat) and a basket of fried shrimp with fries; all of which was devoured with much gusto! The #5 heat had a nice kick and comes highly recommended if you like it spicy... The surprise star of the meal were the French fries; I could not stop clawing at them! Cajun seasoning FTW!

The service was also excellent. Our server (Dawn) made sure my water was topped off while I was hastily scarfing down shellfish. I hope more restaurants like Angry Crab scurry into Ahwatukee!"}
{"text":"This place is the most horrible shit hole I have ever stepped foot in. Service sucks. Food sucks. I blame myself for expecting edible seafood from the dessert. To say the least I will not be back to a angry crab. Btw that is prolly why it's named that you will be angry when you leave. AND I PUT ONE STAR BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T LET ME START WITH ZERO STARS."}
{"text":"Brought my family in here for the first time yesterday. Blew their minds. We all got frog legs, and charred oysters to start. So good. They were gone before we could order our second round of drinks. If you're gonna order a bag, do it trifecta, and medium. It's the perfect flavor combo. I always get shrimp or crab legs and add the sausage corn and potatoes. Make sure u ask for extra bread to sop up the delicious juices in the bag."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my family and the food was good.  Not the best but flavors were spot on. The shrimp weren't overcooked  that was good.  The mussels were done well and snow crabs. Staff not real attentive  but food was delivered promptly."}
{"text":"The angry crab large variety of seafood options we tried the snow crab was delicious also had calamari sticks and fried clams my favorites some of our party had the shrimp basket they said they were very good and priced right. We also tried the BBQ pulled pork, chicken, and brisket, did not have ribs ready yet meat was tender and had a nice smoke flavor I did not like the BBQ sauce but that's just me it was good that it came on the side.The sides were good my favorite corn bread and baked beans others liked the slaw and seasoned fries service was top notch. A loud busy place with great energy."}
{"text":"For starters, how can you go wrong with seafood. (Do I add the question mark it it's a rhetorical question?). Many have done just that, serving sub standard food. The other location I went to was not a good experience. But here, alas everything met and exceeded expectations. 
We celebrated my birthday and my bestie's birthday with my 14 year old. Lots of laughs, free root beer float or cheesecake for the b day peeps. Great service. And guess what? Camo Crab Shack shirts 
Thank you Hector and Ceci."}
{"text":"I thought I was in Florida or Hilton Head the second I walked into this place.  Cheap beer and a good vibe make it easy to spend a few hours here.  A lot of menu options and you can customize your seafood order to get exactly what you want.  The crab legs are almost as cheap as the ones Jameis Winston gets."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!
My husband and I ordered 1 pound of shrimp with corn and sausage, a whole Dungeness crab , half dozen of grilled oyster and half dozen dozen of fresh oysters.  Photos are not that pretty but they taste wonderful! We would certainly recommend everything we've ordered except the grilled oyster that is not that fascinating. 
We tried the Trifecta Sauce with medium hot which was amazing!!!! We gonna challenge the hot one next time!!!"}
{"text":"The service was great and food was good. Have been to several places like this and just felt like the food here is very oily. It's just my opinion. I would say it's like Louisiana sauce were it's watery. The food was good I had the shrimp with some corn, sausage, and potatoes. We all enjoyed it and it's a very fun atmosphere. I just prefer the thickness of other establishments sauce that everything comes in. Really like it and it's very close to my house so will stop for an appetizer and a beer without a doubt. It can get very busy so call ahead."}
{"text":"Great fresh seafood, reasonable prices, trifecta sauce all day, shrimp, wings, dungeness, fried razor clams, all amazing. Would be better if corn was fresh. Over all great. I think I actually like this place more than boiling crab! This place would be 5 stars if the ambience was a little better."}
{"text":"I'm rating this place a 1 star solely on their BBQ and burgers, nothing more. I go because my husband LOVES the seafood. If you don't like seafood this isn't the place for you...in spite of the \"& BBQ\" as a part of their name. So you think, how could a place screw up a burger? By burning it to a very well done burger. And the BBQ over cooked and well done too. Tough and dry. Sucks because this place isn't cheap and I go do my husband can eat their seafood. Oh yeah, they also add on automatic gratuity."}
{"text":"Met up here for UYE and so happy I did. The food here is delicious. Choices include country boils of shrimp, crab, mussels, clams with additions of sausage and potatoes. There are several choices and levels of spice with the heat ranging from mild to wow. I had shrimp, clams and sausage with the trifecta sauce at spice level 3. Very tasty! I also had some plump, delicious Gulf oysters and tasted the charred oysters that someone at the table ordered. Unfortunately they were out of the crab. All of the boiled items are sold by the pound.
The boils are prepared and delivered to your table in individual plastic bags, complete with the sauce. Eating your selection is messy but it sure is tasty.
There is a good selection of draft beers and I believe their is also a full bar. The dessert selection is rather skimpy. Some of us headed for the dessert section of the nearby Whole Food store to satisfy our sweet tooth.
It's a good thing that I don't live closer to Angry Crab, because I would be there a couple times a week. As Arnold said, \"I'll be back\".
If you enjoy country boils and crustaceans you've got to try this place."}
{"text":"I'm a avid seafood lover, and was referred to check angry crab out. I ordered the catfish basket with bbq beans and a lb of shrimp. The sauce I picked for my shrimp was the Trifecta with a medium spice level. The shrimp were overcooked, which you could barely taste the flavor. The catfish was also overcooked, and was overly breaded. The bbq beans were ok, nothing to write home about. I was highly disappointed based of the reviews i heard from others giving this place much praise. Our server was excellent, but that is my only positive thing I can say."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's just like boiling crab without the long wait for a table. Unfortunately for me it's 400 miles from home. I'll stop by everytime I'm in Mesa.

I love the Mexican Coke."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Its pretty deceiving from the outside, but once you get in you realize how huge this place is. They have market prices for the seafood and then you pick the spices and heat level you want. Personally, snow crab 1-2 lbs with the traditional boil 1/2 heat (depending on how brave I'm feeling). This place gets crazy busy so get there early or get there ready to hang out on the patio. 

Any place you can go and grub on the table, with no utensils is my kind of place!"}
{"text":"Great service, amazing seafood!!!!!!  Will be back again and again!!! Drinks are ice cold, servers are knowledgeable.   Spice is hot and flavorful!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The food was amazing, the staff was very friendly and very helpful. The best part is that they are one of the very select few restaurants in Arizona that have Pepsi instead of god awful Coke! That itself warrants 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Angry Crab and the service and food were great!! And yes the trifecta sauce is the way to go!!! I think this is one of the best Seafood restaurants or maybe the best."}
{"text":"We weren't impressed by the service, or the food. We went in on a weeknight with 3 people on our party, and my food came out almost 25 min after the rest of the group. We felt forgotten about by our server, heard others complaining about their tips for a solid ten min right by our table, and the food was just meh. Won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Unfortunately underwhelmed by this place. I feel bad leaving 2 stars, but if I compare it to some of the 3 star places, I don't know if this stands on the same level. 

I guess where it was kinda my own fault is that I went with a small group that wasn't hungry and didn't all love seafood. Based on my past experiences at these kinds of restaurants in Socal, the ideal situation is a large group of seafood lovers so you can split and try everything. 

That being said, I still wasn't impressed. We got the blue crab in mild trifecta sauce with corn and potatoes added. The non seafood lover ordered fried calamari. I likes the corn and potatoes when I dipped it in the sauce, but the crab just wasn't doing much for me and was pretty bland on its own.  Fried calamari was also a little over breaded. It tasted good, but just...Wasn't that great. 

Where I drop it a star is service. I was really excited that we were seated so quickly after 3 different hosts asked us within two minutes if we'd been helped. That's where I had high expectations. Once we ordered our food, we got it quickly but had nothing to eat our food with. We asked our server for bibs first and once we got those we realized we didn't have seafood crackers. When I asked if we could have our crab cracker things, our server said the restaurant was low but she would check for us. That's....strange to me because how else would we crack into our whole crabs without anything? I guess we could get by using our hands only, but doesn't take away from how bizarre I think it is that a crab restaurant would be low on seafood crackers...I thought maybe I was just being picky, until I saw the table seated next to us that arrived after had all their bibs/crackers BEFORE food arrived. So I don't think I'm being unreasonable...
On top of that, I had to ask separately for hand wipes even though our server came asking if we were ready for dessert. Hand wipes in a hands on crab restaurant also seem pretty standard. 

Idk. Didn't sit right with me, and I say that after I really really tried to like this place. Perhaps if a big group of seafood aficionados dragged me here again, I'd enjoy the experience more."}
{"text":"Our server Ben rocked. He was polite sweet and attentive. He even tied our bibs on for us. The fried calamari was incredible tender and sweet exactly as it should be. The fried clams were a little chewy but still tasty. 
We both got the special the angry treasure a mix of snow crab legs, shrimp, mussels and veggies. It was yum. Definitely will come back.

The only FYI it is a loud happy place great for a party but not for intimate moment."}
{"text":"Seafood drowning in spicy lemon garlic butter. Yes Please. Not sure what else needs to be said. Just be prepared to get messy."}
{"text":"The decor and atmosphere is indicative of an old crabbing hut. Been here twice and each time was the same off beat service. Kinda like oh here's your food bye. Did not care for having to dehead the shrimp or the very fishy smells to everything including veggie bag. Prices are in my opinion very high compared to quality and quantity. There are other places around to spend our money at."}
{"text":"Had the best server Tameisha. She was attentive and very kind. The food is always great here but the service definitely makes the experience even better."}
{"text":"Love this place so much but wish there was a location in Scottsdale!! We need something like this off the 101 and Shea immediately!! Come on owners make it happen!"}
{"text":"Place is very good.. the staff is not the best and lacks training but the food makes up for it. Price is good and the serving is not bad..definite ly worth checking out if you are a seafood lover."}
{"text":"Walked in went directly to the bar, open seating. Winning. Wings (homemade sauce) hot isn't that hot. Recommend level 3 and higher to enjoy it and Whiskey were a delight of course.  Bartender was nice and attentive even provided suggestions. TV were on and place was clean. Will return."}
{"text":"So glad to have this location in Goodyear! The food was phenomenal, and our server GiGi was amazing at explaining the menu and dining experience. Such a fun place to go for a unique dinner. We loved it and will be back often."}
{"text":"You got two choices, eat out of a bag with your hands (a sort of low-country boil) or eat fried seafood.   There's no BBQ.  There's no real options other than getting dirty with a bag or sucking down some fried food.   This isn't like the Crab Shack in Newport Beach where there's all kinds of fish selections.  This is 2 ways.  A boil (where you pick your level of spice) or a fried basket  Both have their time and place.  

Oysters were good, but too heavily battered.
Soft shell crab had a weird savory herby thing going on with the batter.  It's crab, don't hide the flavor!   Service was very meh.  Would not repeat."}
{"text":"Love the food especially the happy hour specials as well as the friendly staff, you really can't go wrong here"}
{"text":"Ever been to a Louisiana  seafood boil?   The locals get together,  take whatever seafood they got, throw in some veggies, some cajun style sausage with spices and it gets boiled all together in a pot.  The seafood gets  dumped out on the table, you pick out what you want:   Eat, conversate and enjoy some Louisiana Comfort food,   It's a helluva good thing.  

We loved the food --- I got the Crawfish and had them turn up the heat on the spice, and the wife got the snow crab legs.    We put on the bibs, got a little messy, had a couple of drinks and enjoyed ourselves. 

I got the Crawfish boil:  Cajun style with corn and sausage, heat level 4.    It was plenty hot and delicious.   The wife got the blue crab boil, level 0.    They were both pretty good.

The place is clean and the service was pretty good. I'd come back here again. 

If I could make one suggestion to management;   You took the concept this far, why not go all the way?  Eating it out of a bag sorta sucks:  find a way to do it right :)

4 easy stars!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite place to go. Not only they have seafood they also have bbq which my husband really love. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went to Angry Crab Shack for the first time.  It was an experience.  There were good tunes flowing and a happy, festive environment. The staff all seemed happy to work there and like they were having fun.

We were seated promptly at a table, where our server Judy wrote her name on our table butcher paper. She explained how the menu worked, and made recommendations for us newbies.  

Woodchuck cider was on the menu, and I was a happy camper. What I liked even more was that the \"Bottles & Cans\" section was followed by \"Just clap your hands! Just clap your hands!\". My youngster server was lost on the reference to Beck's Two Turntables and a Microphone. I, for one, appreciated it.

The oysters were fresh.  I liked the raw oysters better than the charred, but it's just personal preference. Both were good.  The charred oysters are cooked with butter, spice and cheese, and are served with small bread.  I enjoyed mine best with the table LA hot sauce.

I made a reach for the alligator basket. It was delicious. The Cajun fries were a bit salty, and unfortunately, we weren't checked on, and my water was never refilled. I wasn't asked if I even wanted another cider until it was the end of our meal. My mouth was like a salt lick, and we had to stop at Circle K on the way home for a big drink.

My husband had a crab and sausage bag. It was kind of pricy to add the small pieces of kielbasa or one potato.  Our butter and sopping bread was forgotten until a few prompts. But the food was tasty and cooked well.

Small service errors aside, I enjoyed our experience,  and will be back."}
{"text":"We came here for my birthday, and had a great time! It is a super casual, fun place, with awesome seafood! We had hushpuppies, fried alligator, and fried oyster appetizers, and they were wonderful! Our meals were so generous, that most of us couldn't finish. The food was prepared perfectly, and everyone was happy, with their choices! We will definitly be back!"}
{"text":"Have been coming for awhile the staff if very friendly n warm..Valerie Adrian Trae the young bartender Jennifer ....the 2 older ladies their are prejudice and wear skimpy clothes that do not help them look young at all but more disgusting to look at..can not believe management let them dress like that....the 1 disgusting thing about this restaurant is the restrooms you come in spend all this money to eat and when when you go wash your hands n see the toilets with fecal matter splattered on them n dirty you really want to hurl all that food you just spent a lot of money on its gross.....you can complain but they don't care very very sad......"}
{"text":"- LOVED the food, atmosphere and service here. I was in town for a weekend vacation and this is one of the spots my friend took me. I got the pound of snow crab with sausage and 2 ears of corn all with the trifecta seasoning. It was all so good. It takes me a long time to crack crab open, but I cracked it all before eating any of it. It was worth the work. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone.

My 2nd time here I did a pound of snow crab with trifecta and a pound of shrimp with the Pacific Rim (coconut curry). AMAZING. I WILL be back!"}
{"text":"Tried it out last Saturday night. A short wait to be seated. Ordered fried oysters, fried gator, onion rings and hush puppies. Everything was over cooked. Fried for too long. Very dark brown. Over cooking the Gator made it rubbery and tough. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere and the food was great for the cost.  Seafood is never cheap but they make it affordable.  Love those hush puppies YUMMY. I am yet to try the BBQ but I will keep you posted."}
{"text":"Fun place to eat. The BBQ is outstanding and put the seafood to shame. I'd come back just for the brisket."}
{"text":"Smaller version of Joe's Crab Shack! My husband ordered the Dungeness crab. When he got it it was the whole crab including the shell. Hey at least Joes has crab that's halfway cleaned so your not paying for a lot of uneatable waste. Flavor was ok but not what I expected. The atmosphere is very graffiti like and very loud. Not me at all."}
{"text":"The crab is decent but nothing else I had was. Fried clams were so overly fried I had to send it back. The replacement clams were a little better but still over fried. Tasted like the fry oil hadn't been changed in quite a while & is used for everything. The interior of the place is reminiscent of places along the beach which is nice as it brought back memories of California. The crab came in a bag right to you fresh. I still wanted a plate but they said they didn't have any. Overall I think my money would have been better spent elsewhere with a more consistent seafood quality."}
{"text":"Pedimos cangrejo y la salga estaba muy rica pero el cangrejo no agarró el sabor, entonces estaba un poco desabrido, las papas nos las trajeron ya q íbamos a terminar de comer... pedimos tambien camarones y eso si estaba un poco más ricos, creo q prefiero hot n juicy."}
{"text":"Been to the other angry crab location in phoenix multiple times and compare to that, this place has better customer service. Bathrooms are also spacious and clean.

Definitely come here if you like seafood by the pound. Trifecta mussels as well as cooked oysters...yes please. Would not recommend  the meat barbecue though."}
{"text":"I was neither angry nor crabby when I left the Angry Crab Shack after dinner there last Saturday night. The Mesa location was hopping with a one hour wait but it turned out to be totally worth it. Organized chaos with a side order of boisterous cacophony thrown in. Our friendly and energetic waiter was also patient as we digested the menu prior to the actual digesting. Wow wow wee wah! Plastic bags of steamed king crab legs and a whole lobster followed the fried frog legs and raw oysters till we threw in the towel as well as our lobster bib. We had the Cajun spices on some, yum. We also tried the mixture of garlic, lemon pepper and Cajun spices, which was was less bold, but a nice change of pace. Set 'em up again please.  Mmmm tasty! We spent a small fortune because we did just seafood, next time I'd do fries etc to keep the cost down. No regrets though, it was a blast and a feeding frenzy that's hard to match."}
{"text":"Great seafood boils. Spices are really spicy! I got the number 1 \"wimpy\" spice and it was almost too much. Veggies were cooked well and the seafood was excellent. Great place to go and dig into your food...literally!"}
{"text":"Went for crawfish but they were out. Had a shrimp PO Boy sandwich and it was good. My gf had the spiced shrimp and it was great."}
{"text":"Mmmmm...LOVE this place!!! I love getting the bags of shrimp with trifecta sauce and veggies! My second pick is the fish and veggie bag. Their Moscow mule is also one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Service is excellent and BBQ good.  Seafood is a tad overpriced but we are in the desert.  Fun place to take friends."}
{"text":"My experience with the food itself was great. The service was absolutely horrible. We visited the restaurant on 12/16 the waitress did not work for her tips. At this point I believe she purposely didn't because we had a group of 9 or 10 people. She knew she was adding her tips to each separate ticket she she was going to get her money regardless. Not sure of her name she was a young mixed with Maybe black and white fake lashes and bun ponytail. She didn't bring our water to us. Quoted the wrong pricing on drink specials other waitresses had to take our order. She was busy playing with her friends child. If it wasn't my Birthday I would have complained to the manager and not paid a tip at all. However I will be writing a letter to corporate as that is what I do for a living resolve corporate complaints. You never know who you have in your store and pull they have. She has no business in service at all it was horrible. She didn't say Thank you either or say a word when we were leaving. If I had her name I would put her put it out there."}
{"text":"I am so glad this place is here! The food is great! My wife and I love the crawfish with trifecta seasoning, level III on the spiciness! Definitely one of our favorite spots."}
{"text":"Well well , our order came but was slow and it was not correct and no condiments, no coleslaw wrong fries and service was slow! We had to ask for several items more than once.. Also very noisy but I guess that's the atmosphere there.. The catfish was overbreaded and dry!!"}
{"text":"Of all things, the fried cod and fries are awesome!  Well seasoned, perfectly cooked.  Also got a special order of fried oysters...  yum!"}
{"text":"Get your hands dirty and order one of the boils. The shrimp were great and so were the crab legs. The hush puppies were some of the best I've had. The Cajun fries are definitely spicy. Frog legs were very large. Had oyster on the half shell too. Really liked them served with a lime wedge. 
The beers were ice cold and reasonably priced. The Kajun Bloody Mary is almost a meal by itself. 
Brandon was out server and he did a great job.
Only negative was the music was up a little too loud for lunch, made it a little difficult to have a conversation without raising your voice. 
Still, I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The service here is horrible.  Thus is my second time trying this place and I have to say it was just as bad as the first time.  My order took forever while my friend received his food and was eating for 20 minutes.  When y order came it.was lobster and I ordered crab.  So they had to re do it again. Then when it arrived it was the wrong seasoning.  I won't be going back it was very expensive.  For those prices I.can go to a great steak house and have my food and service on point."}
{"text":"The location is ok but just the atmosphere is different then other angry crabs, not as exciting, music is way to loud and felt like a DMV location. 
The main problem is the po boy sandwitches, the portions are great but on a dry white sub and DRY!! No flavor at all, don't even think they used salt!  They should really toast the sub, add some more ingredients and make is moist!! It was something my 10 year old put together!! Very disappointed!!"}
{"text":"We had a great family experience on Nov 18, 2017. We were coding from Las Vegas and wanted something different. We chose Angry Crab Shack. My daughter and I chose to do the Dungeness Crab with Lemon Pepper and Garlic while my husband chose the Turkey Club sandwich and the specialty fries to share with our son. Greg was our waiter who went above and beyond to help our 9 year old son up on the high part of the wall to sign his name. We all got to sign and we left a little #VegasStrong rock at the door entrance. Food, staff, and bill were on point for a family of four and what we could eat and wanted to spend. We paid about $80 which includes three alcoholic beverages and two sodas. You get the full experience with your order so if you don't want the FULL Crab or Lobster body then this may not be the place for you. If you like a quiet place without kids, this is not the place for you!

Added bonus: After you dig in and get your hands filthy dirty, they have a big sink that you can wash your hands at. I loved that feature because it was outside of the bathroom. Nice big double sink and soap that didn't dry my hands.

Thank you for the memories!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went on May 9, 2017 to this restaurant to celebrate my 55th Birthday! I really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere! The waiter was outstanding and Pleasant! It was our 2nd time there at this location! We will be back again in the future!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy!! Great place if you have a hankering for Cajun seafood. Very authentic southern style food."}
{"text":"Food and service was great!  The snow crabs were perfect in size and we loved the seasoned Cajun fries"}
{"text":"So I freaking love this place! My gosh it was amazing. The food was fantastic and the staff was super friendly. The place is super busy but honestly it's worth the wait! The place was so busy that the fries that we ordered were taking awhile to get out the kitchen.. It wasn't a big deal to us and we told the waiter it was no big deal.. But he got the manager anyways to come and talk to us even though we told him that wasn't necessary. The manager still came out anyways to talk to us and ended up giving us a couple free desserts (equally delicious)! Honestly it was totally worth going back to again and again. Everything we are was delicious and the dessert were equally fantastic!"}
{"text":"So, we were extremely excited to eat here since it is always busy. Monday night, they offered a bag with various crab, shrimp and veggies for $25. Not a bad deal, until they brought it. You have to pay extra for potatoes, I am good with that. What I was not good with.....the veggies they charged $5 for amounted to about half a cup of broccoli and cauliflower. The potatoes I payed extra for amounted to two french fries and were raw. They did not even cook the potatoes! The crab was overcooked and shriveled with soggy shells that just bent. My husband ordered fried catfish WELL DONE. It was raw in the thickest part. Not well done. The best part of dinner was my husband's french fries. Not worth the $50+ that we spent on dinner. I am going to Joe's from now on. This place is overrated."}
{"text":"Finally!! A seafood restaurant that packs both quantity and quality. I found this gem here on Yelp and I cannot wait to go back. We went on a Saturday night and the place was packed, usually a good sign. We were quickly seated and out waitress immediately greeted us to explain how the menu works and to take out drink order. 

We struggled with making decisions so we ended up sampling 1lb snow crab, 1lb shrimp, 1lb clams and 1lb crawfish. We also went with the trifecta sauce with a 2 for heat on all 4. Don't forget the Cajun fries on the side as well as white rice, you will need something to soak up all of the extra juices. The seafood comes in a big plastic bag and no utensils here so be prepared to get a little messy! I did not even care about how messy it was because everything was so delicious!! One word of advice, the trifecta 2 was pretty spicy, I think next time I'll go with a 1 and I normally like spice!

As we finished up the owner came by to see how everything was. He was super friendly and clearly very passionate about this place. We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Worst experience in a seafood restaurant ever. They knowingly sent a bad crayfish out to me upon order. The crayfish looked gross and when I went to break into it, just all mush. Ive seen how the kitchen operates and it's not very clean. Probably will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Phone in to go order at 6:50. She replied it will be ready to pick up at 15 min. I showed up at 7:04. Pay her  at the bar. Then i saw a to go sitting there behind the counter.  Well, i thought it may be someone else order. Then i stand at the bar area. 7:28. I asked the other bar tender, can u check on our order. Its has been long awhile. I was thinking may be they are really busy and still cooking my order.  Then she wait 5 min for the girl who collect my money to come bk the bar area and ask her. The whole entire time, there was a bag sit at the bar. Not sure why the 2nd girl wont check the one and only bag sit at the counter.  Then girl who collect my money carry the bag which sit at counter for 30 min now(one and only bag) and hand it over to me and said thats your order! Now is 7:40 I said i been waiting for 30 min and the order sit there since i walked in. She said, didn't you order the shrimp. Thats your order!  No apologize.  I grab the order and left.  Wow! What a customer services! Good job angry crab!! Thats kind of services make me not coming back.  No wander no one do to go there. My bag was the only one there for 30 min during the prime dinner hour. When i get home i had to microwave my food because it not hot anymore."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't know why I decided to try this place because I'm not a big fan of seafood, especially seafood served in a big plastic bag. Talk about unappetizing! That said, I ordered the cod, which I usually like, but this was dripping with grease and rubbery. The fries were way too spicy, in fact everything tasted like it was drenched with the same overpowering spice, and it wasn't good. My tiny drink, an $8 hurricane, contained no booze whatsoever. The only thing I liked was the potato salad. Won't be back."}
{"text":"My first visit was a great experience! This place has it going on with friendly and efficient workers who serve up some awesome seafood! I will definitely be back for more! :-)"}
{"text":"My husband and I fell in love with this unique place. The seafood was amazingly fresh and delicious. We didn't try the BBQ but we plan to return. The true experience comes with eating with your hands. Unlike Joe's Crab-shack or Red Lobster, bibs are more than just an ambiance accessory. We cracked open one pound each of crabs legs, shrimp, and clams between the two of us. No plates, no silverware, just hands. It arrived in plastic bags.  We also chose to add in 2 red potatoes (you pick how many) and vegetables. A great place for a fun evening!"}
{"text":"Least favorite of the valley locations. It's on the smaller side which isn't a big deal, but maybe not best for larger groups. There was 6 of us and we were crammed at a table. My chair was wobbly and felt like it might come apart at any moment. 

They've either changed all of their menus or this location just doesn't have all that the other ones do. They lack some of the non-seafood options which is unfortunate considering there aren't that many to begin with. I get it, it's a seafood place but it's nice when you can accommodate everyone. 

There was a hair in my water. Mine and my husband's food came out after everyone else at the table was finished eating. 

I ordered the chicken sandwich and there was a giant piece of chicken on the first half but when I got to the second half there was no chicken at all - and I didn't realize it until it was too late. So whoever finally sent my food out cut it in half but the chicken wasn't split between the two half's. 
Cajun fries were over seasoned. Those who had seafood said it was greasy. 

Probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"I have been to different locations of the Angry Crab Shack probably 20+ times in total. However, despite the Goodyear location being the closest to me, I've only been here twice. The staff is ALWAYS great - very nice, polite and attentive - but in my opinion the food is sub-par. The crab tastes a bit fishier than at the other locations, and always sticks to the shell to the point that I feel like I end up throwing half of my meal in the bucket rather than scrape the meat off the shell. (This has never, not one single time, been an issue at the Peoria or Phoenix locations.) 

Additionally, the restaurant itself leaves a bit to be desired. It looks unfinished on the outside, despite having been open for a while. Beside the front door there is a large unlandscaped area that gives the impression they opened ahead of schedule before the construction was done. Also, on today's visit I saw an enormous bug just taking a leisurely stroll across the area of the dining room where I was seated. Ew. (I was going to order dessert, but that was the encouragement I needed to refrain.)

Overall, Angry Crab Shack gets 5 stars from me, but just not at this location."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. When I'm in the mood for good quality seafood that is reasonably priced, I guess I'd have to say this is my place. We got fried clams, the seafood boil with muscles and shrimp (trifecta sauce is the best....medium is the perfect amount of spice and flavor in my opinion, my 4 year old enjoyed it), fried shrimp, soft-shell crab (cajun mayo in AMAZING), and 2 alcoholic drinks. Amazing...all under $100.00, but the food is REALLY GOOD. It felt like I was on a vacation. The drink we had was the Big Easy, and it's just so so good, with coconut cream, some sort of citrus juice, and rum. If you get something spicy, which we did, this really balances it out. My 4 year old loves the place too!! And she's picky. Nothing but good things to say about Angry Crab Shack."}
{"text":"Excellent food,  better service.   Maddie was great.   She made the experience fantastic!"}
{"text":"I'm a little tough being born & raised in New England.  I have been twice to make sure if was not the batch or cook to blame.  The mussels were ok.  Lobster was overcooked.  Crab was good.  Bakes beans were pretty good.  Oysters tasted good, however, were not very clean.  They were kind enough to bring some more, however, those were not much cleaner.  The calamari was not good at all plus it look like a mozzarella stick.  We went both times when they were busy.  They do have an awesome waiting program where they will text you when your table is ready.  The wait staff was a hit or miss.  One time it was super busy and the waiter was EXCELLENT, however the next time it was not busy at all & we had 3 different waitress who were all horrible."}
{"text":"Excellent Food, Service and a fun place to Dine! Barb was our server and she treated my Date and I as if we were Family.   We will return  Again!"}
{"text":"I use to love going to the original location in Mesa but the last 2 times I've been I've gone to this one in East Mesa and left disappointed. I ordered 3lbs of king crab today and it was over cooked and did not taste fresh. Very sad... The king crab was very poor quality and not the larger and fresher legs I've had in the past. My wife and her grandmother had the BBQ since they don't like seafood which was mediocre at best in their opinion. Too bad something that was once so awesome is now so terrible."}
{"text":"The food isn't for me but the ambience is fun. If you like your food in a bag with a ton of butter and garlic you have found your place!!!  I do like to go there to hang out and have a cocktail!"}
{"text":"Fun place to go... Who doesn't love ripping into crab legs with their bare hands...."}
{"text":"Really like this place. The gumbo is excellent and it is always fun to get messy and eat crab legs!  Really turned off today though.  Spent $30 bucks on crab and 13 on shrimp.  Asked for butter and I got the \"ok but we have to upcharge for that\". Seriously?  Tacky. Not sure I will be back.  Even crappy red lobster gives you butter for free."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been to many of the other locations and the team here is by far and above the best. Food is always amazing and always cooked perfectly. Eric is an outstanding bartender and will not leave you with an empty glass! Noel is a fantastic server, who makes dining at AC a blast! No other place like it and there is no good copy cats out there IMO."}
{"text":"Sat for 15 mins and NO ONE came to take our order or even greet us. One guy did come to put a ketchup bottle on our table, but even he didn't say hello or say that our server will be right with us. We felt completely invisible. It was 915pm and it was not busy at all, so there should be no excuse as to why we were treated this way. I was hungry and angry which is not a good combination so I finally decided to get up and speak to someone. The waiter directed me towards the manager. The manager Derek was extremely nice and wanted to sit down and talk about this. I am sure he would've done his best to rectify the situation, but I had already lost all desire to eat here. Also, being that I am from los angeles I have the REAL boiling crab to eat from, not some sad knock off."}
{"text":"Was there last night, first time. Atmosphere was great! Staff was happy and truly enjoyed their job. Went there for a birthday dinner celebration for a friend, had about 7 adults at the table.
Our waiter, Jeff M., was AMAZING! Saturday night was quite busy, but he made sure to explain the menu to everyone and even helped crack open a friends crab legs. He was so fun! Get there early, wear casual clothes and have the best time of your life! And request, Jeff M. as your server if going to the Phoenix location. I will be back!"}
{"text":"The service was amazingly efficient and even showed us how to eat snowcrab legs with scissors and a nutcracker. Mussels were awesome and don't forget to try the sausage and red potatoes sides."}
{"text":"This has been a favorite place of ours. First time I tried a to-go order.  It was ready when I got there.  Downside was that we ordered the \"bread for soppin\" and it so hard we couldn't eat it!  Had to be old loaf.  Very disappointed in that.  Small thing but important."}
{"text":"Great place for Cajun style seafood, can be pricey but is worth it. Very busy so make reservations before attempting to visit or you'll more than likely wait around for at least 45 minutes. Over all though, would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying that from booking our large birthday party reservation to the actual dining experience this place was great! I called last night and booked the reservation for today, when I called they asked me if anyone had Dietary needs.  I mentioned that one of the kids had seafood allergy and we just wanted to make sure it was still safe for her to eat there without cross contamination.  After 10 minutes of booking the res and the hostess made note of our little niece the manager Jarred called me.  He reconfirmed the reservation and reassured me that our niece would be perfectly fine because his team would be really careful. He even gave me a list of what she would be able to eat.  Upon arrival we were greeted right away and they were finishing up prepping our table.  The Manager Jarred saw us holding the birthday cupcakes and he immediately said hello and asked if he could refrigerate for us.  Diane our server was very attentive.  When she sat us she asked what we were celebrating.  When I told her three birthdays, she took the names of our three individuals.  The food came out promptly and it was delicious.  After Dinner, Diane brought our cupcakes out on a tray with three of them with lit candles.  The staff acknowledged the birthdays through their fun PA system.  Great place for a fun and interactive dinner! Couldn't have asked for a sweeter most attentive and detailed server! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"This place is to die for, I could seriously eat here once a week. I always get the snow crab with level 2 heat and Trifecta flavoring. It comes out perfect every time. The shrimp often come out overcooked so I stopped ordering them.  Next time I'll probably try the crawfish. This is my absolute favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Best place in the world!! Just ate 1 pound of king crab legs and they were extremely thick and fulfilling! I usually have to eat more. I love my waiter Phillip he was so nice and professional. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Our Server Ben is the best! He has an awesome sense of humor while keeping me fed and happy. I'm always esp. Happy when he is in the house. The food is amazing. It's like crack!"}
{"text":"Angry Crab Shack's food is absolutely amazing. The seafood is very flavorful and filling and the BBQ is a delight in your mouth; tasty and the sauce is to die for! I went here for my 26th birthday and unexpectedly had a huge party of 25 guests! The manager and staff were so accommodating even though I did not have a reservation we were seated in 15 minutes. The customer service here is just as excellent as their food! My guests and I had an amazing experience and they helped make my 26th birthday amazing for my family and friends! It was the first time most of them had been there and they were extremely impressed. Travis our waiter was so charismatic, patient and accommodating! Thank you Travis! Also! I arrived with a huge heavy cake and right away the manager offered to put it in a freezer for me! Overall-- the food, the cocktails, the service, and the atmosphere were simply perfect. Thank you!!! Eat here for any occasion! You will not be disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried the Angry Crab for the first time this evening and my fiance and I will definitely go back. Had oysters on the half shell to start with and they were very good quality. For the main course we had the snow crab and shrimp boil with the trifecta seasoning and it was delicious.  our waitress warned us about the seasoning level and she was right. Go a little lower than you typically would and you'll be happy."}
{"text":"Food was good, I had king crab legs.. they were meaty and tasty .. served in a plastic bag with molten hot seasoned butter. no utensil, hands only.. hot messy.. hard to eat.. hubby had shrimp, served in a plastic bag also, he picked a Cajun sauce, same thing very hot and messy.. our waiter never told us we could have had the sauce on the side.. we would have preferred that option, wish we would have know."}
{"text":"The best seafood restaurant in the valley! We got recommended from our friends one time then made us pretty curious about this restaurant a lot. Today we decided to try here. It was great idea to try here! Every seafood we ordered were super fresh and delicious! All the seasoning is great. Service was fantastic! I definitely will come back here again. I highly recommend here."}
{"text":"Awesome and very tasty seafood! Gets busy so show up early and try one of their drinks too. Tried the new pacific curry but I would say the Trifecta seasoning is still the best!"}
{"text":"Ok so it's New Year's Eve and my other half and I are in Phoniex. I'm here for the week on buiness . We just wanted to go somewhere close to the hotel that had good seafood. Long story short I found this place 4 minutes from our hotel. We didn't want to get dressed up and the place looked very local. Bottom line the food was great, not expensive , service was great and everyone was very friendly . You can go wine and dine and pay big bucks but you will not find any better food or service. It was like a hole in the wall place. Mostly New Orleans style. Basically you eat off the table so don't take anyone there that does not approve of Cajun etiquette that can't eat with their fingers. I have the option of eating just about anywhere I want to go. This place filled my seafood desires for tonight. The only negitive was the Bloody Marry I ordered that was really not that great however I soon forgot about it and ordered a Angery Ball . We had shrimp, crab legs , gumbo, hush puppies and some charbroiled oysters that were of the same quality found in Drago's in New Orleans. I will be going back the next time I need a Cajun Seafood fix. Try this place but be ready to eat."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by how tasty the crab legs with the trifecta seasoning was!  However, I'm not a fan of working for my food or how messy it was."}
{"text":"Great service and food. getting hands dirty for deliciousness."}
{"text":"No paper towels in mens room, only electric dryers.  Ever try to clean a stain off your clothing with an electric dryer.  They had a paper towel dispenser but it was empty.  I asked the on duty manager and he said he would remove the dispenser.  That's one way to solve a problem.  Not the right way."}
{"text":"Been here many times over the last few years , the food is still very good , had fried clams good , snow crab legs good , shrimp Po boy good , they forgot our beans which we've had in the past and are very good , had the pineapple mule good , the big easy good , the problem is the restrooms are in trebbile shape and in desperate need of repair , to have no paper towels in either restroom is disgusting , I don't want to touch the door handle knowing people won't wash their hands especially if there aren't any towels and those blow driers are not very sanitary , please clean up your ac"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now and plan on making regular visits. I've had the boil with shrimp both times (trifecta, level 2) and it's amazingly good and want to explore the menu some more. Service was above and beyond on both visits. The best part is they serve Arizona beers on tap, especially from Grand Canyon, my favorite."}
{"text":"Went there with a few of my co-workers.  Excellent, excellent, excellent!  We all had different menu items and loved them.  We will return!"}
{"text":"What can I say? Perfection. I try to come here as often as possible! Love it. I get the shrimp, my fiancee gets the crab, we always get trifecta medium and never leave less than completely stuffed and so happy. Thankfully they have sinks to wash up after and bibs to keep your clothes clean! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Best place for interesting sea food in the desert.  Yes, the food comes in a plastic bag, but it is delish! I usually get a potato in the bag that soaks the juices from the seasoning.  It is kind of pricey, but it is worth it."}
{"text":"Best seafood I've ever had.  It is very casual.  It is usually busy, but if you have to wait, it is worth it!"}
{"text":"I use to love this place but I was a bit disappointed when I went a couple of weeks ago. For one, the prices have really gone up! And the food wasn't as good as before! I ordered some char-grilled oysters and they were dry. When I think of char-grilled oysters I think of New Orleans where they serve them with butter, Cajun seasonings and cheese and they melt in your mouth. These were quite disappointing to say the least! 

I'm sure I will go back and give the ole college try, so let's hope I won't be let down this time!"}
{"text":"This is a family favorite, we eat here at least once a month. My kids love the fish basket and my husband and I have liked everything we have tried (my favorite is the catfish). The restaurant is always clean the staff is friendly and the prices are great."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant. However, they add to much salt to the order so you have to drink a lot of water after you go home. Idk if u can ask them to make the food less salty next time."}
{"text":"Meh. Waited for a good 10 minutes before we had to flag down a server nearby. We ordered wings to start but they showed up after they delivered out mains. Not cool. My husband had a bag of shrimp which he enjoyed, I had pulled pork and coleslaw. Pork was ice cold. Overall a less than impressive experience."}
{"text":"Any place you can eat with your fingers is outstanding I have yet to have anything bad here it's all been outstanding oysters on halfshell, mussels, snow crab, hush puppies. This place is awesome"}
{"text":"We walked into the Angry Crab Shack for the first time and were greeted by  annoying loud music and  knew right away the place may not be for us. The décor is casual,  seating is not terribly comfy but OK for dining.  The service was helpful and cheerful. 

My husband fried cod and fries were delicious as were my frog legs and sweet potato fries.
The mayo accompanying my frog legs was flavorless and the requested garlic butter was replaced by flavored rancid oil. Not a good substitute! Their fish batter is greasier than other restaurants we have sponsored.

We could not see anything green on the menu.  Any reason for that?

If the Angry Crab wishes to expand its clientele beyond the greasy and fried loving crowd, and attract older customers, they should serve some of the food on plates with regular utensils. It is difficult to cut a crab leg with a tiny plastic knife and fork in a small plastic basket. Getting our hands greasy is not appealing to some of us. Salads would be a welcomed addition to the menu.

The Velvet Cheese Cake was commercially made and basically consists of flavored and colored lard. Bland and unhealthy!

I think the Angry Crab Shack has a lot of potential if they continue to serve good fried fish that appeals to a certain crowd  but the food presentation and the absence of  healthier options does not agree with us and for that reason, we would not go back."}
{"text":"Incredible stuff here-and inexpensive.  It is spicy-anything over medium and your lips are hurting....and they go two levels up.  Served in a bag with everything tossed in with the spices (I recommend the Cajun and lemon combos).  I had corn/sausage and potatoes.  It was great-the sausage they use was phenomenal.  My friend had the bbq-we are from Kansas City....he said it was good, but like I said we are probably bbq snobs.  I also had the chocolate cake..which was not very good.  But I'm not rating the place on the cake-if you like crab try it.  Prepare to get your hands dirty!"}
{"text":"I had a whole crab freshly steamed and the server showed us how to crack it open and what parts were good to eat. All there 
seafood is kept in tanks in the back so it's 
as fresh as you could get it. They sell by the pound and you can add sausages and corn on the cob to your order. Big trough wash sinks in the dinning room are very convenient for you to scrub your hands. Oysters on the half shell are to die for. Must try it!"}
{"text":"This place had an excellent atmosphere. I definitely didn't feel like I was in Phoenix AZ!  Everything was great from the food to the service.  Our server was Ben and he did a fantastic job.  I highly recommend this place to everyone!  Thanks for being awesome! And writing on the walls are fun.."}
{"text":"Heard so much about this place (Mesa Location) and that they had opened up a location in Phoenix...so it was a must try.  We went in about 4 PM which was a perfect time, no a lot of folks yet.  In fact, maybe 3 tables...  We were greeted by Shelby, our server for the evening.  She was kind enough to share the process, since this was our first time.  Just know up front, the whole shell fish (Lobster & Dungeness crabs are on average 1.5 lbs and up)  Well, we ended up ordering a lot of different things, so we could try, everything we ordered for the steamed/boil had the Trifecta Sauce (Kajun, Lemon Pepper & Garlic) with Spice level 2 (Medium-sizzlin).  We ended up with Dungeness Crab, Lobster, Shrimp (Jumbo size) & Crawfish (jumbo size) and added sausage, potatoes and corn on the cob.  We also added, the Catfish Dinner and Hush puppies; needless to say, we took a lot of food home.  The season blend/combo we selected was so tasty and flavorful.  Everything penetrated the shell fish well and the season on top of the shells was so good you couldn't help but suck/lick (sounds dirty, but not meaning to) the shells.  The additional (sausage, potatoes & corn on the cob) that were steamed in carried the flavor well too.  The catfish was corn meal coated and fried to perfection.  It was light, fish was flaky...I would be happy just having the fried catfish dinner alone.  It came with some kajun seasoned fries and those were good too and I'm not a fan usually of seasoned fries.  The hush puppies were ok, they had a nice balance of heat/flavor, but a little too dough or dense for me.  Again, our server was Shelby, a very friendly person and very good about sharing information...which is great if you have never been here.  She was very attentive, I don't think our iced teas were ever low.  The restaurant is very clean and orderly and all tables have the basics, napkins and heavy butcher type paper as table cloths (trust me, it's a good thing and needed if you order from fresh market).  They even have a wash sink in the dining area for you to clean yourself up afterwards, so cool....As we wrapped up our meal, it was starting to fill up and folks waiting; so timing is everything."}
{"text":"This was a fun place to come to. Us cousins got together and celebrated family and I had no idea such place existed in Phoenix. Many of the cousins ordered crab legs and lobster, I was in a hurry and leaving before everyone so I got me a fried cat fish basket with fries and coleslaw. It wasn't bad at all, typical fried fish and the slaw was ok, but the Cajun fries were amazing. The one constructive criticism k have is they need more tools to cut crabs' legs, they were short and we had to ask for them many times and the answer was they're waiting for others to finish and they'd wash and bring to us. I think they should just have plenty of tools to accommodate everyone.  Would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now.  Both times the food was excellent!!  The Oysters are the freshest, and the Alaskan King Crab is out of this world.  A must for any foodies bucket list!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! My favorite is the pound of shrimp with potatoes and sausage with Trifecta seasoning. If you like spicy get level 3 spiciness. It's spicy enough to make you hishhhh. lol They use good quality big, plump, shrimp and it is addicting. If you don't like getting too messy, you can ask for gloves. I've tried the mussels and crab as well and they are good as well. Service is always good and love the casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love crab and am in love with the Angry Crab Shack.  This restaurant is good.  I love the rustic style, the dig in and eat.  It is an experience for sure.  The service is usually pretty good, talk about team work.  It is normal to see 3 or 4 different people other than your server.  They truly work together to ensure you have what you want or need.  A fun place to go for dinner, be prepared and don't wear your Sunday best.  You can get a bit messy.  Great place, great food.  Onion rings, hush puppies amazing.  Trifecta all the way."}
{"text":"This place has it all for a restaurant. Ambiance, customer service and great food. I recommend the alligator nuggets as an appetizer (the sauce served with it is like crack)
I have had the shrimp and lobster from here and both have been delicious. I ordered the Cajun and medium, but the trifecta is great too! This was my first time ordering a drink from the bar and hands down their peach mule is in my top 5 drinks. Lastly, our server Tami was very attentive, sweet and overall provided great service!! Will be returning again!"}
{"text":"I really think I \"worked a manic hype up in my head\" too much about this place before experiencing first hand. That's my error. :(

I specifically designated this venue to surprise my dad on his 68th birthday for dinner. Growing up in SW Washington state (coast) has spoiled me/my family with fresh seafood, and I realize this. 

Very high hopes for Angry Crab as reviews on Yelp as well as other testimonials all sang a high praise. 

I encouraged my dad to pick anything he wanted on the menu, natch, as it was his birthday and he can do whatever the hell he wants on his day. He took my advice and ordered 2 lbs of Dungeness Crab. Everyone else at our table got served their food (alligator and cod dishes) and birthday boy sat for a couple minutes. 

Alas, the steaming crustaceans arrived in a plastic bag!! The table ohhh'd and awwww'd while my dad still sat for another 10 minutes as he was not provided any tools to crack the crabs!! Talk about torture?! The female server didn't really seem like she wanted to be working which I didn't appreciate. 

Luckily, his trusty daughter (me) bugged 2 servers for some utensils and an Angry Crab plastic bib. NOTE: Pictures were already taken - missed the boat on any free advertising. 

Why don't you all offer wet wipes/moist towelettes for post-supper clean-up? I mean, a lot of folks are performing labor in cracking their shellfish to consume - don't you think they'd have \"meaty juice hands\" towards the end? Just a thought...

Our table requested the bill be split into 3 (with specific instructions) twice. How did the bill arrive? One giant sum. So frustrating. 

Overall experience? It was just okay - food was tasty but service was poor to marginal. Prices were way too high, in my opinion. I won't be back - left with a somber disappointment."}
{"text":"I have to say the first time we came here our main server was just ok but after coming here again (the food is too good not to come back) and having Noez I believe his name is help us- wow! He is an excellent staff member, very fun server and he even took the time to show a table near us how to eat their shrimp and crawfish after asking them if it was their first time there. I am very impressed. Thank you Noez for a great experience and excellent customer service. And like always the food was amazing of course. The BBQ here is just as good as the seafood, too. So if you don't care for crab- get the BBQ!!"}
{"text":"Don't think I'll order anything that is not steamed; the crawfish and crab we got were a god-awful greasy mess.  Much prefer Joe's Crab Shack."}
{"text":"3rd time. Service very mediocre. Bordering on terrible. Food is average. Won't be con"}
{"text":"This rating is based on service, not the food, as the food from angry crab is always awesome. When we first arrived there was no hostess at the front. We then noticed that it was not a busy day, especially for angry crab. Our waiter was very inattentive until we had to ask the hostess to order something for us because we hadn't seen our waiter in some time. After that the waiter was a little more attentive. Will continue to go to angry crab but will steer clear of this location."}
{"text":"This place was a lot of fun.  We ordered way to much seafood.  We had the King Crab, Mussels, Shrimp, Veggies, Taters, and Hush Puppies.  It was all great.  We also tried three different sauces on the selection of seafood we ordered. 
Plan to get messy.  Our waitress was great, she explained everything to us and all of our options and when we added or altered our order she was totally on top of it.
It was a busy Saturday but we were seated right away. 
The price can add up especially of you add alcohol to the meal.  Be aware they have specific pricing.
Just try it all and get messy."}
{"text":"Service was the best. I had the King Crab Legs with garlic, no spice, n s side of butter (to keep things simple). My boyfriend had the same, but a different sauce, n his spice was next to the hottest one, which once he got it, he still wanted more fire :) I kissed him while we were eating, and the pepper burned me...too hot for me, lol. 
Nice place to bring the family. Lots of big screens with different sports on. U can leave your mark on the wall, just ask for a marker, and the birthday announcements are loud & fun.
Definitely will b going back :)

P.S. I never gave 5's cos of the Red Velvet Cheesecake. It was a definite"}
{"text":"A group of 8 of us went here for my birthday Saturday night. Everything was so so good. Our waiter Aaron was awesome - the place was PACKED, but we never had empty drinks, he was constantly checking on us and making sure we had everything we needed. The appetizers we ordered came out so fast. We ordered a dozen oysters and they were all plump and really really good. We got a pound of snow crab, a pound of shrimp, and a cod po' boy and everything was great. We got the mild spice on our crab and shrimp and honestly it was a little too spicy for me! Next time I'll get the wimpy no spice LOL. Beers were ice cold, food was very hot, and my expectations were exceeded. They even brought out a slice of cheesecake with a candle and cheered for my birthday. It was a good time and I will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I almost hate to leave a review for fear that it's going to get even busier than it was but alas, the food was VERY very good. I ordered the king crab and it was amazing, I'm not usually enthusiastic on seafood in AZ but they manage to keep it fresh. Added sausage and corn tot he boil, very good value and absolutely delicious. My husband ordered the shrimp boil, snow crab with sausage, corn and potatoes. He said it was really good though he didn't enjoy having to peel the whole shrimp which is served in the boil. 

It's a casual restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating on wood tables, booths and picnic tables. The layout of the Mesa location is not great, the people seated in front of the doors are crowded and pretty much on display. I would give up my place in line for a better location than to deal with that. Same goes for the entry on the patio. We said we'd take first available so we were seated outside. It was nice weather but if it were cooler they did have patio heaters. It'd be great if they could expand and have more seating area, or at least change the layout so the front station were in the area on the other side of the doors. 

Price was great, service was pretty good, food was just about perfect. We will definitely be going again soon."}
{"text":"This place is definitely delicious and different way better than Joe's Crab Shack sorry Joe's"}
{"text":"3rd time we have been and every time has been great. Gumbo is out standing. Shrimp boil is a must. Wish they had some sweet tea!!"}
{"text":"So good!  Friend and I both had snow crab legs, trifecta, spice 0, and I added sausage (so good!!) and she added corn.  We had hush puppies as appetizer, scrumptious!  Wonderful waitstaff and fantastic food, can't wait to go back and get messy again!  Wear the bib!  You've been warned..."}
{"text":"Worth every penny.  Best dungeness and king crab, shrimp and sausage I've had in AZ...that's not difficult to do.  I've had all the above in MD, FL, NJ and NY and this rivals all of it.  Run.  Do not walk here."}
{"text":"We've been here countless times . Tonight's dinner is a disappointment. We ordered 2 lbs of \"LIVE \" crawfish and some others but crawfish came out tasted funny , seemed like 1/3 of the pound are dead \". It'has that rotten smell ! So the waitress changed the live to the frozen ones ! We ended up did not touch those 2 bls of frozen ! We are there to enjoy \"fresh \" not rotten or frozen !
I came home with an upset stomach the whole night .  Even though we weren't charged the 2 bls of crawfish but please be  sure food quality and safety are what keep your customers coming back ."}
{"text":"The food is good here.  I got blue crabs and a sack of shrimp, trifecta seasoning medium spicy.  My husband had a Dungeness crab. The food here is priced by the pound, with a pound being the minimum order.  If you order a Dungeness crab, the staff will tell you it is at least a pound and a half.  Ours was almost two pounds (you have no choice which one you pick)-- which made the single crab $34 (their \"market price was $17 a pound; if you actually go to the market a live crab is about $11 a pound, so significant markup, but that was to be expected in a restaurant).  Shrimp had heads on, in my opinion this was in order to get the weight up with actually selling less shrimp in a pound, they were $12/lb.  Expensive.  Also, I am only giving two stars because the service here is awful.  We had a table of 7, there was staff everywhere but we were constantly having to flag people down for assistance-- basic things, like crab crackers/picks forks, etc weren't brought out with the food or on the table; it seemed like they weren't using their staff efficiently although the people we encountered were nice enough.  Not sure if we will go back, as there was really no food quality or price difference from Joe's Crab Shack (which actually was probably less expensive) and the service was horrible.  We always like to try local restaurants, but I cannot say I would recommend this place just based on the price and quality of service.  They do have a full bar and $2 PBRs though, I guess that's a perk.  I'm actually sad to say that the closest comparison to this place is Joe's Crab Shack, which IMHO is mediocre but better than Angry Crab."}
{"text":"Horrible service with mediocre food.  The spices are great but the food made my husband sick.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. Waited for more than an hour even though they said it will be 30 mins  and when I asked they are telling me that their systems are down and don't know when we will get a seat. They didn't even bother to inform us. When I asked to see their manager, I was told they are extremely busy and don't know when they would be able to see me. I would stay away from this place...you don't deserve any stars"}
{"text":"Amazing food, drinks, service!

We started with what we thought would be a 30-40 minute wait for a table- what did we expect on a Friday night?  they send text notification when your table is available (love that!). Our table was made available much sooner than anticipated. The Bloody Mary was super delicious and came with several garnishes-including a nice snow crab leg!   Our server, Dawn, was personable, and while we could tell she was super busy, she made sure we were taken care of, and explained any expected delay!  The menu was AMAZING!  Nothing sounded bad!  I had the snow crab boil with added vegetables (1 pound!) and corn on the cob with the Trifecta sauce at level 3 heat. My companion, the Incredible Running God, was more adventurous and had the shrimp boil (complete with \"everything that shrimp was born with\" as our server put it-eyes, tail, legs) with the Trifecta sauce in level 4 heat-\"Angry ghost\". Be prepared to sweat with level 4 spice!  The kiddo had the pepperoni flatbread which sounded like a horribly boring choice, but hey, what can I expect taking a moody tweenager who hates seafood to a crab shack!  The place was packed!  And for good reason!  It was our first trip there, but certainly won't be our last!"}
{"text":"Great food.... Excellent service.... Fun atmosphere!!!!!!!   Loved watching the manager walk around with live lobsters so people can take pictures!!! Will be back for sure!!!


Update:  
Went back for a 2nd time!!!!! Same great food and excellent service. We had family drive in from out of town to try it... Their hooked now too!!! Great job by the staff!!! That's a sign of great leaders!"}
{"text":"I'm giving the angry crab shack three stars due to the lack of customer service. The food was great!

Our waitress was nice, but very forgetful. It took over 15 minutes to get water. Other people in our party of 5 ordered other beverages and those also took a very long time to receive. When they wanted refills, it took another 15 minutes! We had to remind her to get our drinks. She forgot one of them and it took a while to get it. I only received one refill of water during the 2 hours I was there.It wasn't packed and it appeared as though there was plenty of staff. I don't know the dynamics of the restaurant, but waters and refills of beverages are pretty easy. The table behind us ended up leaving due to the long wait for beverages. 
On too the food! For appetizers we had the frog legs, raw oysters, and calamari. I didn't trying the frog legs, but I was told they were bland. Everything else was delicious! 
For our main course we had dungeonous crab, lobster, clams, king crab legs and two orders of hush puppies. Everything tasted delicious! It was very messy, but worth the mess. I would highly recommend the number 1 sauce with the clams. Dipping the hush puppies in the sauce was amazing!! I would like to go back to the customer service portion of this review. When we received our meal we weren't given bibs or tools to use. These are a MUST. So we had to wait to track down our waitress. At this point she could probably tell we were very irritated with her. I understand she didn't bring the food out, but there needed to be some type of communication or she should have given them to us prior to our food coming. We spent over two hours there when really it should have been one. 

Overall the food was very good. Bring a water flask and clothes you don't mind getting messy in."}
{"text":"blazing hot mussels , so flavorful that even after the heat i'd still order the same dish next time .and there will be a next time , it was a cool environment and great food"}
{"text":"One of the most interesting and unique experiences me and my family have ever had going out to eat everything is served in a bag including your potatoes sausage and corn flavors are amazing Larry was our server and the manager Chris came by to our table as well as all the other tables to make sure everybody was happy and the place is a lot of fun you can tell by the amount of people in the vibe in the place will definitely go back and recommend"}
{"text":"The trifecta seasoning was freaking great. The andouille sausage was the best I ever tried. We ordered some crab legs and shrimp. Both were tasty as hell. Our waitress was the one one that had short blond hair and was fantastic!I 'll stop by again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"I treated my sis out to dinner tonite but wanted something other than mexican or pasta, so I hopped on Yelp an came across Angry Crab, the food an service was excellent, loved the atmosphere,  some of the best an most flavorful seafood I've had in quite awhile, I highly recommend it an say hello to Cassie, one of the servers, she's absolutely amazing!!!"}
{"text":"The food was okay nothing super special. If you want overpriced average seafood this might be your type of place. The service is even worse the waiter was too high to remember half of food, and the fact I told him it was it husbands birthday."}
{"text":"Our server Dil was so kosher! He MADE our angry crab experience the best I've definitely ever had. Give him a raise or ask for him personally! Fun guy. Wish I could have tipped him a lot more! He's a keeper!"}
{"text":"I had the King Crab with Trifecta sauce and no spice. Absolutely amazing. We also had the calamari sticks which were also great. Shelby served us and she was so friendly and helpful. One of my favorite spots!"}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of this place! This was my first time here and we were celebrating some birthdays in the family. Our server, Remy, was great and explained everything clearly. Basically, you can order seafood or BBQ and they have appetizers, sides, plates to choose from. The seafood is by the pound, and 1lb is the recommended start. We all ordered something different and it was a good idea to be able to try from each other's picks. I ordered 1lb of shrimp (which equals about a dozen) with corn and potatoes, and they cook it all together with your choice of sauce (the trifecta is a popular one: lemon pepper, kajun and garlic), the level of heat 0-5 (our server told us she likes spicy food and she orders a 2) all in a bag. 

Our orders didn't take too long to come out, the longest was the lobster. Everything was delicious and the 2 is super hot, and I thought I had a decent tolerance for spicy foods. I loved the corn and the shrimp was my favorite from everything I tried. The lobster was also pretty good. The service was great, you get to eat with your hands and they provide plenty of napkins and water. We also had bibs, too. There's a washing station at the back to clean up. This is a fun place to go with family or friends and the walls are filled with signatures and messages; add your own if you find any room!"}
{"text":"GREAT Shrimp cocktails, awesome drinks.  Id id not have the seafood bucket but it looks amazing."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time on my birthday. It was fun experience to have food using both of my hands. Seafood is as fresh as we can find in Phoenix with this price range. I also got surprised birthday cake and they sang birthday song for me."}
{"text":"If you like cajon, you'll like this place. Good food, good service, friendly staff. The crab was great. we are taking some back this week."}
{"text":"DELISH!!!!  Great seafood, eating off the table with yours hands... Kaitlyn is the best waitress!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great shrimp and crawdads but it was like we were being ignored buy the waitress Jen and probably will never go back because of that"}
{"text":"Crab by the pound?  Yes please!!! I go for the trifecta 2-3 depending on how spicy I'm feeling. So good!"}
{"text":"It is our second time here and every time the food is delicious! I always get the one pound of shrimps with the trifecta sauce (garlic, butter, cajun), it's their house favorite! You also need to choose the spice and honestly I get \"0 - no spice\" and it's a touch spicy, the right amount! We don't even need any sides, it is plenty of food! And $12 for a pound of shrimps is not bad at all! You eat with your hands so be ready to get messy! There is a sink in the dining room in case you got a little too messy..
We will be back for sure, very nice restaurant. We like it!"}
{"text":"For a celebration dinner, I chose for the family to go to Angry Crab Shack.  I have no idea why everyone gave this place such rave reviews because I have never regretted going to a place more than this place.

From the start, we were in for a string of service and food disappointments that has caused me to never go back nor recommend eating at any of their locations since.  After entering and standing at the host station for over 10 minutes with zero acknowledgement while others bustled about.  After finally being seated in one of their booths, we had a chance to examine the menus to see what was so awe inspiring about this place to have so many rave about it.  
I am not very adventurous when it comes to food for a variety of reasons so I picked something that I have eaten often, snow crab legs, with flavors I am used to.  After all, if I was going to compare these to others I have had then I had to be fair with the ingredients, so I chose the snow crab legs with garlic sauce and mild spice to be simple and fair.  After the extended wait, I ended up with a warm plastic bag with some legs and some liquid.  Well not the nicest presentation for the price but thought from the surrounding décor and the \"story\", it fit the theme.  Yet for that price, I expected to have properly cooked legs of which they were not.  For being a restaurant that seems to be focused on seafood and wants to bring you that kind of bill, you would think they know their product and how to prepare it.  The meat did not perfectly slide out in those gorgeous succulent clumps of red and soft white.  Nope, I had to fight each one and, even after using a fork to scrape, had strings of flesh still attached in every single cracked shell.  WHAT A WASTE!

Then on top of this, I felt was the final straw that added insult to injury was with \"the Fixin's\".  I have had crab legs in restaurants from California to Massachusetts.  I have eaten them buffet style in Las Vegas at the Rio and napkin in lap overlooking the ocean in Seattle.  YET, this is the first time EVER I had been served legs without clarified butter.  When I questioned where the butter was, that is when I was pointed out that it is available for a charge as seen on menu.  Ok, my bad for thinking that listing on the menu was a charge for additional servings but asked the server to please bring me some even with the charge.  Now, I do cook and bake myself and I am a firm believer in the use of real ingredients such as BUTTER.  I know the consistency and taste of butter when cold, room temperature, whipped, and melted.  The server brought the small dish with yellow liquid, that the menu has written to be melted butter, to the table and walked away.  The minute that I put a dipped piece of mangled crab meat in my mouth, I immediately spit it out.  That was not a reaction that the family expected so they asked what was wrong.  I told them, \"if this crap is butter then I am the next Queen of England!\".  My niece snickered but in all seriousness, the yellow liquid tasted like the \"butter\" that you get on your popcorn at the movie theater.  You know that golden oil that has a butter flavor but beyond that we know that there is nothing about it that is butter.  So, picture for a moment: you have agreed to pay extra money for melted butter to dip in your overpriced overcooked crab, and instead you are given something that tastes like movie theater \"butter\".  Yep, I was done!  No number of explanations or apologies was going to make me return to this place.  When the server returned, I told her this butter was not butter as advertised and to which she replied with attitude that it came out of the melted butter container so I asked her go ask the cook if that was 100% butter.   She left with a slight huff and within 5 minutes a man who said he was the manager was at the table.  He let me know he that I was the first who had ever asked but that their \"melted butter\" was in fact a combination of butter and margarine.

So, in the end, if I could give this place zero stars I would.  The service was poor, the food was not worth a third of what our bill was and frankly any restaurant that will charge for an item that is NOT what is stated to be on their menus should be closed indefinitely for selling lies to their customers.  Since it is unlikely that would even happen, all I can do is write a review about my personal experience and never step foot in another of their locations"}
{"text":"The reason this gets a 5 is because the food was hands down the best crab I've ever had. The spices were so delicious. I will be making many frequent trips in the near future. 

I love this place. It's my go to food joint. Love the people. Been coming here since they've opened. Love everything about it."}
{"text":"After a good hike, we look for a restaurant that we can reward the hard work.  When we pulled into the parking lot, the crab fighting a pig sign catches our attention.  It is an odd combination to see BBQ and Cajun food at the same restaurant, but heck, the review was great, so we gotta try.

We ordered a lb of shrimp and clam.  The spicy level at this restaurant is pretty strong.  We had medium and it has some kick already.  The shrimp is nice and big, but may not be completely fresh.  The clam has a little bit of sand inside.  The frog leg was a nice surprised, but the frog leg was huge and a bit chewy.  the meat has a bit waxy taste.  Perhaps frog taste is just not for me.

Beside the Cajun food, I ordered the Pit Plate which contains brisket, rib and pulled pork.  I had the mustard sauce and it was tasty.  Meat fall off the bones and are very tender.  I strongly recommend this over the cajun food."}
{"text":"Have never dined in at this location but have ordered take out a few times. Freakin delicious. Every damn time!!"}
{"text":"Wowza! First time in and I will be back! Service was a little slow but they were super packed. Our server was great and I could tell he was trying his hardest to be attentive though he was swamped! The food was so good I honestly wouldn't have cared about the wait time or the service regardless! We had the shrimp & snow crab both trifecta and #2 and it was delicious. We also ordered a side of fries which were crispy and super hot! Loved every bit of it. I could have lived without the horn though! Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Met a friend here. Her choice. I went with the pulled pork. I know, seems everyone likes the Cajun stuff but I just wasn't feeling it. And seems I won because she got gumbo and felt it was \"meh\". She said that, too. I tried it and it was just a bit bland. Seems like a hot or miss place. I can recommend the pulled pork. It was super yummy. People seemed to be enjoying a lot of messy dishes around us. Maybe a good place to pick apart shellfish..."}
{"text":"Long wait on Saturday night but worth it!.  Drinks are strong ( and too sweet just like NOLA) and the sauces are oily, spicy, and absolutely delicious.  We has crawfish, oysters , and lobster.  The fried food were overly fried but the rest was a messy delight."}
{"text":"This place is beyond yummy! The staff is fun and my kids beg to go back there nightly! 
thank you for the great food!"}
{"text":"VERY LOUD!!! Food was fair-good. A little different way for crab and seafood for me. You pick your crab, shrimp, scallops...Then choose your seasonings, corn or potatoes. It's then brought out boiled/steamed in a plastic bag...Had the Cajun seasoning and was VERY HOT! I like hot but this was a bit much. Overwhelming hot. Really good bloody Mary's. Atmosphere was a big NO for my liking as far as a business traveler. Probably best for families with kids and gatherings. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"Ive always seen mixed reviews about this place. The food was great, seemed like a very busy night. I waited an hour for my meal, but everyone was really nice & ended up comping my meal. I'd definitely go back but I wouldn't suggest eating here if you are in a hurry"}
{"text":"Always love this place. Food is fantastic and our waitress, Lindsay (whom has waited on us twice now) is great. She is friendly, fun and very efficient. I think we waited 5 seconds for our drinks to be filled when they were empty. She was on top of it."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of seafood.  I'm a fan of beer.  I'm a fan of eating with my hands.  I am not a fan of plates.  Therefore I am a fan of the Angry Crab Shack.

This place is fun and more importantly, the food is stellar.  You order your fish by the pound from the day's selections and choose your spice blend.  They boil up the fish and deliver it to your table to be poured out and eaten with your hands while wearing a bib.  They have some very good apps as well and the staff was extremely friendly.  

The one downside is the wait can be extreme so be prepared.  The wait is well worth it though."}
{"text":"I've been to the one in Mesa and I recently came to the Phoenix version.  The difference is this one has a MUCH better bar setup, less wait time, some TVs, and BBQ.  

Read my other review if you want to know about the seafood (it's fantastic).  For this review I want to tell you about the ribs I had here.  They were tremendous.  I am a BBQ hound and these were some of the best I've had.  I was blindsided by them as I was expecting regular restaurant ribs.  

Seriously, the only thing better than a seafood feast with some cold beers is a seafood feast with some cold beers and ribs.  

I love this place.  For a fun evening out with friends over good food I can't think of a better place to enjoy your evening.  Just wear something you don't mind throwing away!"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed by this location so far.  My first visit was lackluster but fine as was this one.  The management even contacted me for more info so they could straignten their issues out.  That's nice but there is clearly a lack of leadership on site.  There are plenty of people working though.  I counted 18!!! people in the front of the house.  About half were standing around dancing and half were cleaning.  From my restaurant experience that's a very successful ratio actually.

- Still no happy hour and this time there was no happy hour pricing on drinks.  This is funny because there was last time I was there.  Also, the bartender even gave us a run down of the happy hour prices before ordering our drinks.  
- Ordered some raw oysters that came out lukewarm. Once my friend and I ate 1 oyster each we just stared at each other with an \"oh no, what just happened?\" look.  If you've ever been sick on oysters you get awfully skittish if something tastes off. Especially in Phoenix in August.  We had to send them back which is an unfortunate waste of food.  What likely happened is someone put them under a heat lamp before serving.  Even if that's the case, I certainly wasn't taking any chances.  
- One of our drinks was made with the wrong liquor.  They did end up comping that.  
- Second time I've been where no salt/pepper or utensils are available at the bar.

The upshot here is the bartenders and staff were nice and the food is (usually) very good.  I was so excited about this location since I live two minutes away but both visits thus far have left me shaking my head wondering what's going on.  I'll be back but, quite honestly, I can't see any reason to return until closer to the end of the year when, hopefully, it catches up to itself."}
{"text":"I have probably been here 6 times now. I have visited 3 of their locations and I seem to like this one the best. I always grab the mussels in the trifecta sauce. We have not yet had a bad experience. Even when they are packed on a Friday night, it is well worth the wait. After I found this place I won't even try another seafood place. I highly recommend adding the angry crab to your regular dinning routine."}
{"text":"Amazing! The shrimp trifecta hot is so good! Everyone's always nice & in a good mood. People complain about it being \"too messy\" well they give you bibs so calm down lol. This place is always on point!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. First time in and I will be back for sure. 

The service was impeccable ask for Josh when you go in. Both Josh(server) and David(manager) went above and beyond while we were there. It's rare when you go to a restaurant full of people but the service is so good you feel like your the only ones there. Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"The snow crab and lemon pepper shrimp was really good, didn't like that there was always loud sirens and waiters yelling \"someone likes it hot\" or \"it's someone's birthday\" had to try to over talk all the noise in there and we took kids and they didn't like the loud sirens and noise so they cried or got scared every time but the seafood was overall good and fresh"}
{"text":"What an awesome place to eat. My new favorite. If you are in the area it's a must. Ask for Korey. Great seafood and the BBQ is fantastic."}
{"text":"Bad seating the girl in the front has a bad attitude and it took us forever because were are a Hispanic family not an equal restaurant"}
{"text":"So here is my deal with this place, love the atmosphere very divey for sure with young staff.  I've only been here once and honestly not sure I will return because before ordering our food the waitress actually said \"eating utensils are a hot commodity and are hard to come by, so if you buy crab I will show you how to eat them with your hands\" ... now I try not to be too boogie however when you are at a crab place and there aren't any crab utensils to help split a king crab leg then why would I want to buy it... also reminder you are a crab shack and should have enough utensils for people to eat with!  Hell when you go to Joe's Crab shack they have so many they actually have utensils that they expect people to steal LOL 

Other than that - the hushpuppies were the best that I had and the cod and frys that I got were pretty good, beans were horrible though.  

I would have loved to try crab at the crab shack.. but I guess I will have to try to do that with my hands next time LOL"}
{"text":"All I can say is YUM! Wear a shirt you don't care about and get reAdy for the real nitty gritty Cajun seafood with an efficient staff.Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Worst food I have ever had here.  Burned with a server that was horrible that was training. Gross. We were here with friends...it was embarrassing. 
Yelp wants me to keep posting about this...I need to keep typing about this horrible food."}
{"text":"I was surprised to find the place nearly full on a Friday afternoon.   For my first visit, I had to try everything.  I tried the cod, fries, dungeness crab, raw oysters, shrimp and mild trifecta sauce.    Btw, be forewarned, eating at the ACS is serious business and can get messy.   My first time eating a whole dungeness crab with my bare hands!   This is not the place to wear your finest silks, if you know what I mean.  ACS does their part by supplying guests with a complimentary bib.   The food is honest, tasty and portions are generous.   Fries are excellent and cooked to a crisp perfection.   The oysters were large though mild in flavor.   The trifecta sauce can be wicked hot so eat at your own risk.    That trifecta heat can turn someone into a human sauna!  The fish & chips (cod) came with three large chunks and perfectly cooked.    I loved the veggies in trifecta sauce, plain.      

Look forward to my next visit to ACS!"}
{"text":"Had to check out this new ACS and was not disappointed.    Food was just as good as the ACS Mesa location but this one has bbq!   Surf AND turf... oh, yeah!    Got the meat platter.  Pork ribs were my favorite.  Smoked to perfection and oh so tender.  Fell off the bone and right into my mouth.  Yum.   The dungeness crabs were a good 2+ lb. and enough share.   The king snow crab legs did not disappoint.   Cajun  fries cooked to perfection.     Service was slightly better at the original location but am sure ACS will work it out.   Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"The service is terrible, if I could give them a whole bunch of zeroes I would!!! our party of 13 got here before another party of 14. They told us 59 minutes and when I checked at 55 minutes they told us we were next. Suddenly they sat the party of 14 saying that the party size was different. Are these kids at the front that naive to think we are this dumb???  I'm not sure if this is discrimination or what but it is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect and I don't eat any fish, but my spouse does.  I was happy they had bbq to choose from along with some other non fish items.  It is a different style service in that your fish comes in a plastic bag and you just eat from that.   My spouse thought it wouldn't be filling, but we took shrimp home.  Everyone loved there food and we were satisfied.  The one thing that we didn't like was the added gratuity for parties of 6 or more.   Overall, kind of fun and different than your usual place."}
{"text":"While the food was ok, the service was not. We were told to wait 35 minutes for a table and it took even longer. We counted at least nine empty tables while several groups waited to be seated including us. I'm guessing they were short staffed because they definitely weren't short tables. We waited just inside the front door but there were so many flies outside they kept coming in when customers would go in and out. It was disgusting. 
When we sat down to order my husband was served beer in a glass with a large crack down the side and when he asked for a replacement it came 10 minutes later after he asked a second time.  The food came out as it was done in the kitchen rather than waiting for everyone's order to arrive together and they forgot our side order of cornbread until we asked twice for it. It was a 2 x 2 square that they charged two dollars for. Our server also never followed up with us to see if we needed anything else (which we did) and we had to hunt another waiter down to get our check. 
I was so disappointed because several friends went to the Scottsdale location and raved about it. I definitely would not recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"First let me start off my it was my idea to come for lunch. Coworkers had never been before. It's an experience yes but there are much better food choices for the price. 

Po boys are the obvious lunch choice. Oysters are small. Bread was not the right choice and quite soggy. We also got a bag of muscles. No taste and many in the bad didn't open. This place is pricy!"}
{"text":"Since opening this place has gone to the pigs. Unsanitary conditions of dining room and unsanitary practices of staff are appalling. I shudder to think of what it's like \"behind\" the scenes. If I were the Health Dept I'd have shut them down immediately"}
{"text":"We brought my 6 month old son with us to this family friendly restaurant. It was great to see how accomodating they were for a place to setup the baby at. We had no idea what to order and the waiter gave us great tips and suggestions. We were so suprised at the amount of food we got and our son loved all the flavors too! That was his first chance at seafood which was great! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Thanks Angry Crab in Mesa for making my 25th anniversary dinner a disaster. We are not  fancy people, but we love good food and have been to Angry Crab in Ahwatukee many times, it was fantastic. For some stupid reason, we decided to go to the Mesa location for our anniversary and it was not a pleasant experience.

First of all, we are seated at table/booth that is right on top of other customers, even though there is plenty of room in the restaurant. Nothing like getting close to people you don't even know while shelling seafood and getting greasy fingers. The first thing the waitress says is basically they are out of the 2 of the 3 types of seafood we wanted. We should have left at that point. But it gets better. 

Would you like to order a drink? How about sangria? Nope, out of that too. She brings us water while we decide what is left on the menu (or is it on the menu? It might be technically, but do they actually have it? No way to tell). She brings back ice water in flimsy plastic cups. It tastes like salt. WTF? Never mind, I'll have a Corona. 15 minutes later, my Corona arrives- at room temperature. WIth no lime. Husband takes it back to the bar, they offer me another one at the same temperature. Apparently the beer cooler is malfunctioning. 

Meanwhile, our oyster plate arrives. Some mysterious waiter/server/bartender (I have no idea who he was- he didn't introduce himeself) whips by our table and says, \"Can I take that plate for you?\" while simultaneously trying to remove the plate which is still half full of oysters. I told him to calm down and get away from my table. 

The food was good, but atmosphere and service leave a lot to be desired. Come on, Angry Crab, you can do better. You need to step up your game. I'll tell everyone I know to go to the Ahwatukee location."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food was great. Customer service was superseded my expectations. I ordered the snow crab, sausage, corn on the Cobb, and red potatoes all of which was phenomenal. After demolishing my meal and drinking a Louisiana Sweet tea (made with deep eddy vodka) I am now ready for bed. I highly recommend this Angry Crab over Hot and juicy. Although hot and juicy has prime real estate on Mill ave, Angry crab has the better food, cocktails, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have been dying to go to this place forever. I finally went with one of my friends, our server was pretty cool he knew a lot about the food. I ordered the Dungeness crab, my friend ordered the lobster, they both came out about under 2 pounds. Now I've never eaten a fresh crab straight out of the pot before so this was new to me and I did not have the best experience because it was hard for me to get a lot of the meat out. I wish I got the lobster which had more easily accessible meat then the crab. ill definitely come back and get the lobster or shrimp again. also is pretty pricey, we spent 40 bucks each of us without appetizers"}
{"text":"Came for a late lunch with our family and it was very family friendly  (we took our toddler). Delicious seafood boil, great staff, lots of options. We got mussels, shrimp, sausage, corn & dungeness crab with the trifecta. Wonderful!"}
{"text":"Nothing has ever portrayed the amazing experience of being a homeless man eating from trash bags in the back of a seafood restaurant quite like angry crab & BBQ. Nothing is better than gnawing a whole potato and whole sea creatures out of a garbage bag on your paper table cloth."}
{"text":"I have been here 2 times already and here is how my  experiences went.
First visit: when I first visited the newly opened restaurant it wasnt so busy because it was the day after thanksgiving. The service was awesome and the food was not overly amazing but enough for me to come back. My husband and I had ordered the fried calamari, fried catfish, pound of king crab, pound of shrimp,  and a pound of crawfish. We wanted to try as much as possible. The server recommended that we try the trifecta flavor cause its good. So we ordered everything that flavor. Only to find out that what she had recommended was not what she ordered.  Crawfish was ordered in a different flavor. Which we didnt complaint about.  So everything went fine, nothing too big. 

Here comes the second visit:
I walked into the restaurant exactly 8:00. I had a party of 20 so I expected to wait since it was busy. Up to ths point, I was okay because they were busy. When we finally ordered it was 9..
30 mins after we ordered, the waiter tells us no more chicken tenders for the kids. Okay, they were really busy earlier we assumed, but 30 mins to check and tell us? Whatever. Another 20 mins past,  I finally asked after waiting over 50 mins, by then we had finished my king crab legs, where is our cod fish fry and our fried calamari? Then he goes into the kitchen and comes back saying \"we are out of calamari\" are kidding me?! After almost and hour after we ordered, you tell us now? Are you trying to make money? I figured they would want to order more since they stated in the menu, 18% gratuity for a party of 8 or more. Whatever again.
By this time 3/4 of the restaurant is empty!! 
Even with this horrible service, we got charged gratuity which we didnt complain about. 

Over all angry crab, the food is good when they are not busy but the service is horrible. If you want to go eat here make sure its not at a dinner rush time and don't EVER go in large party."}
{"text":"Great flavor and variety of choices. The trifecta sauce is incredible and the medium spice level was perfect. The mussels were delicious and my son loved the cod! Can't wait to get back."}
{"text":"I miss Phoenix!!!   The Angry Crab was delish!  That trifecta seasoning is life!   Definitely wish i was local and had the ability to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Best crab we have ever had. Great service. Cool environment. And football to keep spouses entertained. Nothing else to say."}
{"text":"They serve a 5 star meals. .. I've been there like 10 times now ... and will keep going back ...i love my seafood :)"}
{"text":"I have eaten here before over 2 years and my experience has decreased from WOW great food!  to I will never spend my money on this place again. The food was a lot better then, tasty and flavorful and the service WAS great too. I went this week and and my experience prompted me to never return. Both the service and food were HORRIBLE. 

Right from the start our experience was bad. It took a while for the waitress to come and when she did she did not appear to be happy to serve us. .My husband mentioned it was our daughters birthday ( she loves crab and that is why we went) the waitress responded with a disinterested OK...she is 3.  We placed our order of crab legs in with trifecta with corn on the cob, potatoes, and vegetables. We waited an unusually time for our food which was odd.We went during lunch and the place was not busy at all. The waitress came back to our table to repeat our order. We were finally brought out a bag of shrimp. We told the person bringing the food who was not our waitress we did not order that. She took it back, we waited and wanted to know if our order was correct since no one bothered to come back to our table, and flagged someone down to find our waitress. She came and we asked about order and she said the crab legs were coming without further explanation. 

We finally received the crab legs in the bag.. without the potatoes and corn on the cob we ordered with it. We again flagged someone down ( at LUNCH TIME in a unbusy restaurant) and asked to speak to the manager. We told him about the missing items and issues with our waitress. He apologized offered to get the missing items which we promptly declined do to the wait time, and revealed it was his 2nd day on the job. He said we would make sure we were not charged for our items we ordered but never received. Ugh...


The food was not good. The snow crab legs were scrawny and tasteless and a bag with more claws than you expect. BAD FOOD...at $18.00 a pound x2. 

I did not see the waitress after we were ready to pay so went up to the bar so I could get my bill and pay and she was there, I asked for my bill and it was wrong. I was still charged for the corn on the cob and potatoes we did not receive and the manger assured us he would correct the error, and I was charged twice for both item. I Pointed out this mistake and she was surprised I did not receive the items. Then she argued with me about being charged twice. 

In summary, my review of  Angry Crab, from someone who loved them at one time....BAD FOOD, BAD SERVICE...stay away."}
{"text":"I love this spot.  Friendly service and great food.  If you like hot, grab the 5 and trifecta sauce and seasoning.  It's pure enjoyment!  I've been here three times and it's been consistent.  The char-oysters are great!  The wings with a 4 or 5 seasoning are heavenly.  Ribs are good.  Good beer selection and the bar area is large.  This is a place I crave."}
{"text":"Went back for another try. Redeemed!!! Thanks for the invite. We tried the pots for the first time. The trifecta was amazing!! Had hubby snoring last night, it was so good. We will kee coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great vibe, great happy hour! This will be a regular spot for me. Try the Clam-Mari on the Happy Hour menu. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food was good. It was fun cracking into a whole lobster and eating with your hands! The employees ruined it though. We sat outside and they would come out on their breaks and drink and smoke and talk loud and play loud music on their phones  right by where we sat. If we knew we had to deal with that, we would have sat somewhere else. It was extremely rude."}
{"text":"Came to eat on recommendation of a friend. Left before we ordered. Very loud. Food served in bags and you eat off the table. Paper cups like a fast food place. And out of the oysters we came for. Not returning."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had the deep fried soft shell crab,  for lunch and it was  amazing.... The fries and coleslaw that came with it were very good,  and the fry sauce was a great touch!  Only negative was the potatoes in the potato salad weren't cooked,  but the potato salad itself still had a great flavor.  I've been waiting for a seafood joint besides the big chains to give us peeps here in AZ some more choices.  I'm looking forward to going back again."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed. I knew crab wouldn't be fresh but I expected at least grocery store quality.  We had a dozen oysters, which were good, large, fresh tasting although a little skimpy with the sauce.  I had the snow crab as they were out of blue crab and several other things.  It was dried and salty, just like the week old frozen stuff at the grocery store.  I'm not a big eater but I left hungry and at 15 dollars for an entree  I should have at least been a little satisfied.   
I gave them 3 stars because everyone else's food looked great.  Cat fish at the next table looked very good and satisfying, dungeness  crab looked good too.  I think if I ever go back I will just get the fish.  But, it's a long way to go for me and there are half  a dozen places between here and there that have good fish.  I was going for the shellfish.  I was really hoping this place would be good, rats."}
{"text":"This place is great. But they may be out of many menu items sun-tues. Highly recommended though!"}
{"text":"Good stuff ! we got lucky and got there on a wed around 12 pm and got a table with out a problem.   Basic good ingredients make for a great grab. I'll say it is a bit messy but that is part of the fun of eating there.  Love seafood ? this is your place."}
{"text":"It was good, but too oily still not the same from Bay Area.... Great customer service.... i love the size of the Shrimp and Crawfish... Will come back...."}
{"text":"Got to give credit where credit is due. 

The food was fantastic, I had the catfish and my fiance had shrimp. Our server, Shane, was totally on top of refills. It was great!

Totally my fault, but I left my keys on the table and when they cleared it off (they use paper tablecloths for obvious reasons) my keys made their way to the dumpster. The hostess and 2 other employees all dug through bags of trash to help me find my keys. Totally above and beyond!

Even without the dumpster diving I would have given 5 stars. Thanks to the whole team for a great dinner!"}
{"text":"\"There's a spicy party in my mouth!\" That was my reaction upon taking my first bite and is probably the best way to describe eating at Angry Crab Shack.

This location has both seafood AND BBQ to satisfy everyone's cravings. They have a good selection of drinks (Mexican Coke ftw!) and serve a variety of craft beers which is always a plus in my book.

I went with the alligator plate because I've never had alligator before and thought it'd be a good time to try it. Everyone always says it tastes like chicken but I say it tastes like BETTER chicken! :P My sides included BBQ beans and Cajun fries which are far and away better than those of Five Guys. I have to say though that the winningest ingredient of the entire lunch was the sauce. I got a Trifecta #2 (slightly spicier than mild) which hit the spot. I also tried some of my coworker's Trifecta #5 (extremely spicy) and was downing water for like 5 minutes while my mouth was literally on fire haha! Definitely a challenge, and not sure I could stomach #6. Can't wait to come back for a bag of their seafood!"}
{"text":"This location is inconsistent in terms of sauce taste. I love a good bag of seafood or veggies in trifecta medium sauce but it is a hit or miss. At times the sauce is extremely flavorful and balances the cajun, garlic and lemon pepper well but other times it just tastes like spicy butter. I usually like to order the cajun fries with my seafood since the food isn't too filling. The fries are crispy and delicious and the perfect complement to the more moist seafood. I love the clams, shrimp, blue crab, and dungeness crab. They are usually fresh tasting with the exception of the shrimp on occasion. I like adding the extra potato and corn on the cob as they absorb flavor better than seafood. The pound of veggies is a great meal option for eating a bit lighter since there is a good variety in the bag.
The service is nice when they aren't too busy but be prepared to wait for water refills when they are very busy. If you're in the area, and crave seafood I recommend it but if you are closer to Mesa then go there since they are more consistent."}
{"text":"My first time dining at the Shack and I am already hooked and slightly addicted to it. Since is was our first visit, our server Dion took extra time to go over the WHOLE menu, explain all our options, and answer all our questions. Our table started off with fresh raw oysters that came in a platter over ice and tasted as if they were scooped out of the ocean. I ordered King Crab with the Trifecta sauce at a spice level 2. Now I like things super spicy hot, and a level 2 spice definitely kick back. My wife had crab in a lemon pepper sauce with a level 0 spice and that was very good too. All the people in our party were pretty silent, just heads down, enjoying the deliciousness of our Cajun boiled seafood. I've been to lots of fine dinning restaurants, but I must say the service was outstanding. Dion kept all the beverages full, replenished napkins, and removed finished items without us even asking. The restaurant was packed too, so extra skills points. If you look around all the staff seemed to enjoy being there and it showed. I SO,,,can't wait to come here again. If you do go, bring a marker so you can write your name/message on the walls."}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant on Channel 8, 'Check, Please'. We both love dungeness crab, so here we are. We selected a 2+ pounds if crab at $18/pound, with the mild cajun boil. I also ordered corn, save your money, not worth it. Ordered the cole slaw which was pretty decent.

Make sure if you're eating from a boil bag to ask for plastic gloves which fit us loosely. Bring your own gloves for a better fit. Once you have your gloves on, open the boil bag and start tearing the bag open and you better know who to crack a whole crab because it's up to you.

The crab tasted great and had delicious flavors. The only problem was the crab didn't fill us up. We ordered the Soft Shell Crab Sandwich. Everything tasted great except the bun. It was just a piece of dry bread with no dressing or condiments.

We'll be back to try something different like the Shrimp Boil.
."}
{"text":"Opening night started off with a N'awlins bang! We were greeted by pirates, given beads without having to do anything provocative, and started off with a couple of fresh daiquiris. We are so thrilled to have this place across from our house---yup, we can drink and walk home! Decor was great, service was friendly and everyone loved their food. A couple of expected hiccups--out of crawfish by 6pm (damn I really wanted those), my meal was delayed a bit resulting in over cooked shrimp , but all was swiftly resolved and delicious. My lips are still burning!! Evan took great care of us tonight. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I had not heard about this place for all the years I lived in Phoenix. It was absolutely packed on Saturday, so we had to wait for about 40 minutes. Luckily they have a decent bar with good beer options. 
I ordered a pound of snow crab legs, Trifecta sauce with medium (#2) spice, with corn and sausage. The food comes in a plastic bag filled with all the toppings and sauce. Give it a good shake, then you're ready to dive in. The flavor of the trifecta sauce was incredible. My god it was spicy, and I can handle spice of a decent amount. If you choose any spice above medium, you will have an interesting day or two following. This stuff is so delicious, but messy as hell, so I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night at 6pm and there was a line about 5 groups deep to request for a table. The wait was about 25 minutes and they text you when your table is ready. Once seated our server came over and told us of the options you pick your protein then your sauce and then your heat level. We tried the trifecta which is a combo of the Cajun, garlic, and butter we chose heat level 2 which is medium and it was so good and a great heat level. We also tried Pacific Rim which is coconut milk and curry and a level 2 and that seemed almost spicier than the other. They were both really delicious sauces. Everything comes out in bags and you definitely get messy. They provide bibs and gloves if you want and a big wash sink for at the end. We added corn red potatoes and veggies to our bags. Everything had great flavor. My niece declined a refill on her soda only to say it was flat after the server walked away and he brought her a new one. Not realizing he heard her he was great. The only reason for 4 stars is the shrimp which is great flavor they come full shrimp head included which is fine but they cook the shrimp done done so they are really firm and not just cooked to perfection"}
{"text":"Food is okay but you get very little for the price you pay. $1 extra for \"corn on the cob\" gets you one, little mini-cob. $0.50 extra for \"potatoes\" gets you one, little red potato. $4.50 gets you a tiny sliver of \"Pecan Bourbon Pie\" that's not that great. $1 extra gets you a scoop of vanilla ice cream that's obviously been melted and re-frozen. 

Service is lackluster and overworked - one waitress for an entire section of about 10-15 tables and 5-8 booths. 

And, then there's the ear-piercing, heart-stopping SIREN that goes off and makes the entire restaurant jump out of their seats when someone orders the \"super hot\" spiciness.

Not going back here again."}
{"text":"I Just found my favorite seafood place in AZ! I have not been disappointed as of yet! We always order the Trifecta sauce with crab legs, vegetables, and potatoes! OMG! The Trifecta is this amazing sauce they put in the bag of seafood broil!! Just awesome sauce!!!"}
{"text":"Super long wait all the time. I've been here since they first open. I've gotten great service and food but lately, whenever I order crabs, they're still uncook. The manager(or whatever the lady is) just looked at it and said well, you did start eating it so we still got to charge you for it. There wasn't any apology or service to make it better. When my friend got his food check because mine was still uncook, it was checked but the attitude wasn't sincere and it was more of a brush off than anything.

In any case, I do like the food(shrimps, mussels and Cajun fries) but I will probably only go here if someone invite me to it from now on."}
{"text":"I will start by saying that by the looks of the outside we were hesitant to take our teenager inside. It looks like a bar. When we walked in, we thought it was tacky as hell. The owner was our server and was super attentive. We ordered a pound of garlic snow crab , a pound of lemon pepper shrimp and chicken wings. Everything was SO tasty! Our drinks were never empty and we rolled out of there...stuffed! I guess, don't judge a book by its cover because the food and service here is amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been hooked since my first visit.  Every time I have been there - Angry crab has exceeded my expectations and then some. The food is as fresh as it gets. Get there early because it does fill up fast.

A couple of tips - 

Don't wear nice dress clothes .. it gets messy
Expect no utensils (usually)
Expect a paper table cloth
Expect a plastic bib
Grab a nice Micro Brew on tap 
Gator nuggets are AWESOME
Oysters are also AWESOME
Now - go get yourself some.

BTW - Judy is an awesome server - :)  

Peace"}
{"text":"Second time here. First time was ok...Had King Crab last time. Lobster today. Was OK but nothing to write home about..I expected more spice/flavor. Waitress made no recommendations regarding spice level etc. Had to ask for plates and additional tools. Weren't even asked if we wanted dessert. Prefer to have things served at the same time. Ordered sweet potato fries which arrived at least 20 minutes before the lobster as the waitress said they liked to serve food hot. I like to eat it hot but then they should plan how long it takes to cook etc. For 2 people our bill was over $100. Not good value for $ in my opinion. No offer of any bread/roles etc. They even charged an extra $1 for butter... Also don't like letting my credit card \"disappear\" when it is time to pay. Should be able to pay at the table or at the door."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday. I am in the restaurant industry also. My server Michele was not good, just an order taker.  Zero friendliness and I came here based on an invite from another person that works here. I I'll. It be there anytime soon. Food was not that great also. Got just a knife, no fork. Got bill without asking. I was in the mood for another drink but it turned me off.  Come on restaurant..you need your customers more than they need you. They can go anywhere with their $$$$."}
{"text":"The place is interesting and fun-great decor and large tv screen in front of the bar. The food was ok. We had the snow crab and vegetables. The eat out of a bad method was different and crab in BBQ instead of butter was different but good. The BBQ and beans and coleslaw were all dry and so so. Corn was so so. Hush puppies were solid  especially with the ranch to dip it in."}
{"text":"I'm very familiar with this style restaurant of boils of seafood laid out on table And the food was very good and it was very NOLA oriented as opposed to other less region specific places but the servers should explain the process a lil better for people that might be their first time"}
{"text":"Hubby & I are here, and he had the shrimp & clam po'boy, and the crab legs, and I had the 3 platter meat. I must say, it was good! Our server was friendly, quick, and catered to our every need, although we didn't have many! I'll be back."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the valley! From Florida where I grew up on local seafood and this place is the next best thing in Arizona!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants.  Make sure you use the Trifecta sauce, its incredible."}
{"text":"This  was a WOW restaurant! Really thought it was cute inside and so fun. Seafood wad amazing! Shrimp delicious. Loved the corn, potato and shrp in bag. I would skip vegetables. Brisket very good too. We thought it was a great value."}
{"text":"I had a pretty fun experience here! My family & I came here about a week ago and it was kinda fun. We each had crab legs and shared some gator nuggets. The gator nuggets were great which I didn't expect. Pleasantly surprised here."}
{"text":"The food is good, and the prices are reasonable for seafood especially considering the quality. My biggest issue is the customer service. They fall flat every time. I just don't understand why they can't grasp how to service customers when they are delivering a good product.

Their customer service is so bad that I don't even like to dine anymore I always order my food to go, but the last two orders that I placed to go there has been so many issues that could've easily been avoided. There's no one at the front door when you walk in. The employees are socializing and all over the place. The orders get mixed up and no one knows who ordered what. They also leave off things such as sauces utensils napkins and even try to stop all of your food into one small bag. It's just annoying.

Management is not too much better. While everyone is friendly, I spoke with a manger when I was served dried out burnt calamari and shrimp. The manager was nice and asked me to com in the following day for a refund and that she would also treat my daughter and I to dinner. She said she would be there all day, but when I arrived the next day she was not there and a man who introduced himself as the general manager was. He said he would give me a refund or food, one or the other which is understandable, but not what Pamela had promised me. I asked for a refund and gave him my card. It took him over 15 min to come back and he had written down my card info and said he would fax it to corporate for a refund. Seriously, all that for a refund? Why should I feel comfortable leaving my card info with them? Very unsafe.

Management at this restaurant needs to hire more help and find some more organization so that customers don't see your employees humiliated when they're not doing what they're supposed to be doing. There's no communication among employees and you have a bunch of young people that don't know how to use their skills and their critical thinking to create solutions for customers. 

I personally feel like if you are a fan of seafood you should give this restaurant to try, but please be prepared and patient as the service is terrible. Also me personally I have to take a break because they have really gotten on my nerves."}
{"text":"Upon arrival to the Angry Crab Shack location in East Mesa, AZ, I was met with a strange, brackish smell.  I assume it may have something to do with the restaurant being a seafood restaurant - shrimp, crab and crawfish.  I can't say that I've ever met the same smell at the S. Alma School location.

The server was enthusiastic and attentive, and all of the servers of the restaurant were attentive and helpful in providing drink refills.

The food came out as it has on multiple visits to the Angry Crab Shack at S Alma School, flavorful, hot and yummy.

We lucked out and came right before the dinner rush.  This location has a large bar at the center of the restaurant and looks like a great place to enjoy drinks while waiting for a table, or for dining."}
{"text":"The food is awesome! They have a unique way to serve and eat with your hands. I have never made such a mess when I eat. The staff all came by to make sure my drinks are full and I'm having a good time.  I have tried 1/2 of the menu so far and will be back to try the rest. I would have given 5 stars but it is a loud atmosphere. Just be ready for the feeding frenzy."}
{"text":"Food is good. No gater, no Blue crab, 
No lobster under 2 pounds. No sausage,  
No French fries.  REALLY,  We dropped almost 200 dollars and still changed for kids meals. Get out."}
{"text":"Despite all the mixed reviews we still decided to drive from the west side of phoenix to try this place out. I would have to say, I have experienced better. The food was fine, the only reason I gave them stars to begin with but the service was just... BLEH. We waited for about 20 mins even though there was plenty of tables open (not sure why).

Once we were seated, we ordered and it did take awhile for the food to come out but they were somewhat busy so we didn't mind. Everyone's food came out except mine, Everyone ordered shrimp and they got theirs except for me, after a good 15 mins of waiting our waiter finally came over to check to see how we were doing, I had told him we were still waiting on one more order. He came back and said that the kitchen was backed up and it should only be a few more minutes. I was just whatever at this point, you would think all of the shrimp would come out at the same time... guess not. Anyway when it finally did come out, I am pretty sure they messed up, I had ordered the trifecta (not sure which but it was the one that barelly had spice), and I kid you not I was sweatin! It was just as spicy as my boyfriend's shrimp (maybe the medium?)  if not spicer! I was too hungry to care so I sucked it up and just ate it. After my shrimp came out no one came around to check on use anyhow so I couldn't say anything if I wanted too. 

All in all, they are a new restaurant and maybe in time they will have better service but we shall see next time!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! I have been to many seafood restaurants and I've never experienced a seafood shack quite like this. The menu, the presentation and the ambiance was all outstanding. Choose your seafood, pick a sauce, pick a temp and voila! your delicious food arrives in a plastic bag right from the boiling pot. I got a lb of the Snow Crab legs with trifecta sauce, mild and corn on the cob--seriously an unforgettable taste and experience!"}
{"text":"Great service ! Great food! Omg soo awesome. So I really do not like to eat with my hands, as in ever! Well, I had to get over quickly- it as it is back yard style. They serve it in a bag with paper on the table. https:Hands down the very best shrimp I've ever had !!! The service was excellent Marena was great!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow this our 4th time there this time no kids we sat at the bar the place was packed they never disappoint the food was amazing like always but I was surprised by the free hat and when other people saw it they got 1 as well Dave your a true gentleman keep up the good work my friend We Love Angry Crab"}
{"text":"Yes, Yes, Yes!!!

Seafood was amazing. The BBQ was ok but certainly the seafood is worth the trip. The hushpuppies are great too. The atmosphere is kind of wild, certainly not a quiet night out. Kid friendly and seemed very willing to accommodate large groups, there were several there  the night we were. A little pricier on some things than they need to be but all the same the seafood is fantastic."}
{"text":"Ribs have been great although better at times then others.  The crabs are great too.  Place can be super busy.   There's not many of these places around that's for sure but if you are in the mood for crab legs and or ribs I highly recommend it .
It will be busy so go early!"}
{"text":"First visit to the Shack tonight.  I had the Catfish and teen daughter had the Shrimp.  Neither of us were impressed.  The catfish was so overcooked that it was mushy inside the breading.  Granted, this is not their specialty, so I will probably try again, and will update my review after the next visit.

And BTW, to the hostess working 5/29/2016 at 7PM, those high-waisted shorts need to go, they are unflattering. (Sorry, I know some would consider that rude or inappropriate.  It is what it is...)"}
{"text":"Went around 6pm on a Saturday night. Certainly busy, but we were seated within 30 minutes. Very friendly and efficient waitstaff. All the seafood was great. We had crab legs, shrimp, mussels, clams, as well as corn, sausage, and potatoes. Spice level was right on. Everyone had a great time. My only complaint would be the television selection. Was set to fighting, which I could have done without, both for me and my children. We would definitely go back for great food and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Want Crabs? Go for the trifecta!

You wear bibs, you get dirty, you lick your fingers, you smile. 

Love that this concept has finally made its way to Phoenix. I'm not a seafood aficionado by any means, but I love a good time, and this place always delivers. 

Some seafoodies might say that it's lacking in freshness and quality, at which point I might direct them to a map and a calendar. If it's out of season and delivered to a desert, it might not be at its very best, but that doesn't mean it's not some kind of wonderful.

Furthermore, if you're like me and like little more than shrimp, they've got a plethora of other options. Sweet potato fries, spicy sausage, and edamame just to name a few. 

It's great for groups and great for fun, but *word to the wise* if you've gotta paper cut, you better not come."}
{"text":"Second time here and oh my goodness, it's so good and much better prices than Boiling Crab in California. Sizes of the food are bigger, prices and lower, flavors and sauces are good, and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good old fashioned messy fun! The end of our cross country journey celebrated with a seafood feast at the Angry Crab. We had a dozen oysters on the half shell to start. Gumbo and cornbread was very tasty. Then came the muscles, king crab legs, crawfish, and veggies in the trifecta sauce- delicious!  Spicy!  So be careful if you are wimpy for spice like me :). I ordered level 1 and my mouth was on fire...still enjoyed every bite! Delicious. We joked about the bibs they provide...but seriously this is messy- sauce was flyin' even when I was being careful! Each type of seafood comes in a doubled plastic bag...simple no frills family style fun.  Don't come in expecting to have formal table settings...or wearing fancy white clothing! :D 
Great final stop for our week of travel...Portsmouth, NH to Phoenix, AZ ~ quite the journey..."}
{"text":"Ordered a shrimp and oyster po'boy and a few sides. For some reason they brought out my order \"to-go.\" They also forgot half of my order. The po'boy was not very impressive. Honestly i regret ordering it. I also ordered a beer towards the end of my meal and it sat on the bar mat for over 20 minutes. When the waitress brought it over she said \"sorry for the wait, would you like me to remove this from your bill?\" I said sure, thinking that she was insinuating that the beer would be free. But no, she walked off with it and poured it out. Im giving them two stars because honestly everyone in my party got extraordinary service. We were all laughing at the fact that I was the only one getting terrible service."}
{"text":"Crawfish and Snow Crab, Trifecta sauce, level one spicy (I know, it's wimpie, but last time level 3 had me dying, and I love spicy food. So, baby steps). We tore into it like savages. Best Crab boil I've ever had. Only downside was the waiter didn't know that much about the menu. Got it with veggies, potatoes and some of the best sausage I've ever had."}
{"text":"Went to the Angry Crab last week with a couple of friends. I had never heard of this seafood in a bag concept, which is apparently the new \"thing\". I have done the more traditional clam bakes, etc. in the past though. 

I really enjoyed this place. Having been craving some East Coast food, this was an opportunity to at least somewhat indulge the craving since we are in land-locked AZ. The atmosphere was awesome, with picnic tables and kitsch all over the place. A nice laid-back place to relax and hang out for a while. Our waiter, Noel, was incredible. You could tell he LOVED his job, which was nice for a change, and he did his best to make sure we had everything we needed. 

We ended up with a smorgasbord of options from the menu. Got some oysters (they were huge!) and hush puppies for an appetizer and both we wonderful. For the meal, we did a pound each of shrimp, mussels, snow crab, and crawfish. We ordered it all in the trifecta sauce at a medium level and thought it had a nice kick to it. I wouldn't order it any hotter because I'd be afraid the heat level would overpower the flavor of the actual seafood. 

None of us had ever had crawfish before. Noel told us he would show us how to shell it, so we ordered. We were there late in the evening (after 8), so the place had cleared out considerably. Noel ended up sitting and shelling with us for about 5 minutes! A lot of work, but we all enjoyed the crawfish. 

The only negatives for this place would be the napkins are useless and the sauce was a bit oily, but that's a personal preference. All our food came out hot and around the same time. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yummm! It was our first time to Angry Crab and it was delicious! 
Our waiter, Brandon was very informative. He guided us on what to order and it was as very delicious! Great job, Brandon! 
Don't get too crazy with the spicy - the 1 and 2 are plenty! King crab and the trifecta are where it's at! The hush puppies are amazing. Next time we are going to truly the chard oysters!"}
{"text":"This place is great for boil in the bag fish. I can't get past the shrimp, trifecta with 2 heat rating. It always makes my nose run but that only makes me peal and eat faster. You might also want to add sausage and potatoes to your bag as well since this allows you to sop up some of that delicious goodness. It's very messy. But who cares? When you're in a very casual picnic setting with a bib and plenty of napkins, it just doesn't matter because the food is that good and I hope no one else is judging me for the devastation on my face and table."}
{"text":"Big Place, seafood sold by the pound, go with the shrimp and Trifecta Sauce, and don't forget the Lobster is worth it!  This is my second time here, I had tried the BBQ the first time, and wasn't too impressed by the brisket, but I'm picky with BBQ....

Also, excellent service here, everyone is extra helpful and knowledgeable on the menu especially for first timers...  that alone makes the place worth it..."}
{"text":"I'm grew up in New Orleans and I can honestly say that this place feels like home. From the atmosphere to the food and even down to the music. I love this place! It's like my home away from home. The owners are also really sweet and Autum, the owner's wife, is always here greeting people and even waiting on tables. The food is amazing and the service is even better! I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"The original review was written a relatively short time after they opened. Since that time they have changed a lot. The restaurant is moving more towards a sports bar, emphasizing broadcast games and beer. 

The food is still quite good, but the atmosphere is now gone unfortunately.

I arrived with a group of 12, and we waited about 45 minutes to be seated because they will not take reservations. The best description of the service would be chaos. Orders were sent out incorrect or incomplete. The crabs were not from their usual source, and were unanimously pronounced inedible. Fried clams arrived almost in a burnt state, and wait staff had to be constantly reminded of missing items. Calamari was good, but all were wondering how it arrived in the shape that it was served in. Was it chopped and formed?

My personal food arrived with two different levels of seasoning - one with level 2, and one with level 3. The mussels were nice, but a number of them were unopened. Usually, that is a sign of dead shellfish, but in this case, it was a sign of undercooked shellfish that did not wish to be opened and eaten.

They were supposed to take American Express by the end of September, but they are not. One of our party was charged $290.00 on a credit card which then had to be voided. Unfortunately, that charge tied up that amount of money for the entire weekend on that credit card.

Unfortunately, what promised to be a really wonderful venue to eat at, has turned into an attraction for the college crowd with poorly trained wait staff. Most of our party was very disappointed and has stated that they will not be returning again.

Removing one star"}
{"text":"Okay, lets do this! I've never been to New Orleans nor have I spent any significant amount of time on the east coast, so my seafood ratings may be lacking experience. However, I do LOVE seafood, and when you find a great seafood in a place like Arizona you its like an unexpected surprise!

Food: AWESOME. I have been a fan of king crab legs since I was little, so I was pleased to see them on the menu. Additionally, they had shrimp, crawfish, clams, mussels, blue crabs and more. I opted for a shrimp boil, trifecta level 3, some crawfish trifecta level 3 with sausage, and my girlfriend got the king crab legs, trifecta level 0, plus some raw oysters and gumbo. The oysters weren't the best I've ever had, but they were really good. The gumbo was AMAZING. I'd go back just for that. The shrimp were shell on, and after the first or second one I was hooked. So garlic-y and spicy and perfect. The crawfish were HUGE, but they were kind of disappointing imo. First, you only eat the tail which is like 20% of the crawfish, so youre paying for a pound of crawfish but only eating like a quarter of a pound. Second, they appeared to be a TAD overcooked and rubbery, although I've never had crawfish before so maybe thats just how they are. I will say that the sauce/boil/juice they come with made it basically worth it, I would bottle that shit and drink it daily. Speaking of this fiery sauce, I got a squirt of it in my eyeball and I thought the apocalypse had started. Once I resumed consciousness I got back to work. The sausage that came with the crawfish was good too, reallllllyyy good.

Atmosphere: Relaxed. This place is all about getting down and dirty, I was covered in sauce and shrimp bits after my meal, thankfully they provide a bib so my clothes were fine. Had to wash off my face in the bathroom though. They were playing fun cajun music that wasn't too loud/obnoxious.

Price: It was $90 for 4 pounds of awesome seafood, plus oysters and gumbo. I was fine with that. Not cheap, but we got a lot of food too.

Overall this place is awesome, I don't even live near Mesa but I'll be back."}
{"text":"We love Angry Crab. It's miles ahead of Joes Crabshack. Actually we used to love Joes. Should have been to Angry Crab sooner."}
{"text":"Wonderful joint with the best shrimp boil outside the bayou. Don't forget to add sausage and corn to your bag. You should order NOLA's finest brew, Abita Purple Haze, to wash it all down. My sweetie loved her mussels too! Amazing and friendly staff topped of a perfect and fun time out!"}
{"text":"Some things you need to know about Angry Crab Shack: 

1) You're going to get messy. Don't show up in your finest threads, mmkay?  There are sinks in the dining room for you to clean up. And let me assure you, you WILL need and use them.

2) It will be busy, but I promise it's worth the wait. Simple solution ... Don't show up super hungry, eat a light snack before.  Or you can do what my MIL/FIL/SIL did:  Get impatient, then go to a subpar pizza joint in lieu of an epic wait. Whomp x 100!

3) It's absofrigginlutely delicious!

Dude and I tried ACS out on one of his rare Sundays off work. Thirty minute wait, which was no biggie. 

Our server was an absolute doll, explaining to us how seafood boils go, how everything is priced at market prices, etc. 

We ordered: 

1) Hush Puppies. So damn good, and I'm not a big fan of them! The sauce they give you (some kind of jalapeño ranch?) is the perfect compliment. 

2) 1 lb of Shrimp in level three Trifecta sauce (I believe this is lemon, Cajun and garlic combined).

3) 1lb of Snow Crab in the same sauce.  

Everything was super fresh, and deliciously messy. 

We LOVE super spicy foods, and I'm glad our server talked us into getting the level three Trifecta instead of four. That stuff was perfectly blazing! 
 
Ended up getting a side of the level four for dipping, maybe one day I'll get ballsy enough to actually order something with it.

Overall, a great experience, solid customer service and some of the freshest seafood you'll find away from the coast. 

Can't wait to come back again and wash all that delicious food down with a few Abita beers!"}
{"text":"This place has some great seafood! I got the  boiled shrimp and medium heat and it was absolutely delicious! 
However, you have to work for your food and it gets real messy! It all comes in it's shell or claw that you have to break out yourself. I had a lot of shelling to do for my shrimp but once I got to eat it, it was very worth it! Be warned that this is a very messy meal and there will be juice EVERYWHERE. I will definitely come back, they know how to do Cajun right!"}
{"text":"What a fun and angry delicious seafood place!! As soon as I walked in I was surprised by the loud screaming and bell ringing. I guess each time someone orders the spiciest option on the menu all the waiters scream and ring this huge cow bell. How fun!!!  This place is pretty big and great for groups. I went with my friend and we were quickly seated. The menu is simple, you choose your seafood by the pound, then the sauce and then how spicy you want it. They also have entrees and sides you can order. 

 We went with a pound of shrimp and a pound of snow crab and added a potato and corn inside the sauce. They have cheap beers on tap $5 I got their kilter ale, it was pretty good. The pound of shrimp came in a plastic bag separate from the pound of crab meat which was fine. The shrimp were nice and huge, they were kind of over cooked since they tasted a little dry but if you kept dipping them in the spicy sauce then it was fine and they also came with the heads.

 We ordered the medium sauce which was a little spicy but not too bad. The crab legs were good, they were a good size and offered a lot of meat but I wasn't to impressed by the taste. They provided tin buckets to dump all our shells and trash and I really enjoyed making a mess at the table since it was covered up with paper, making it easier to clean. We also got a side of sweet potato fries and those were really yummy. Unfortunately, they were out of craw fish because they were out of season but they seem to get shipments three days out of the week so that's pretty good. Maybe next time I'm in town Ill have to stop by and see if they have any craw fish that day."}
{"text":"YUMMO! Perfect place to have a filling casual meal! No frills which I love! Specials change, branch out and try something new! KING CRAB LEGS!!! So delicious."}
{"text":"Got there around noon only half full-- good news. Nice clean place. Travis was very helpful. All menu items looked great and probably were. I selected my favorite seafood-- fried softshell crab and gumbo. Crab was perfectly crispy fried but inside was tasteless mush. Can't even guess what was wrong. Gumbo was ok but would not be tolerated in La. without a lot more cayenne.    Friend had mussels, they were real good w/trifecta sauce. Will be back on next trip to try shrimp and crawfish."}
{"text":"Wish I had taken photos but my hands were busy with the shrimps and snow crab legs cooked with the spicy Trifecta sauce! The service was as good maybe even better than the food that I ordered. The place was packed with seafood lovers like myself and everyone seemed to enjoy their dinner. I finally found a chill place where I could have seafood and do some \"people watching\". 5  stars for Kaitlen, she always checked on us and made sure that our drinks are always filled up to the brim!  We will definitely come back to Angry Crab Shack!"}
{"text":"I love seafood and I like this place a lot it was a simple no nonsense type of place. My only Issues are twofold one is that you can't get the crab cold it always comes hot And secondly, although not their fault the pricing can be very high as crabs are usually fairly expensive"}
{"text":"A must stop for seafood in the desert! Here's why:

Seafood is fresh flown in daily - no rubber crab legs here!

Sauces, sauces, sauces! They allow you to chose how spicy or flavorful for those who don't enjoy the heat. My favorite is the trifecta level 4 - Warning this one has a hellish kick.

Awesome happy hour M-F (3-6pm)! I'd suggest trying the kettle chips w brisket topping. The chips never get soggy because they're gone before you know it! 

Overall awesome spot for Cajun / Seafood Bag Boils."}
{"text":"Love this spot. It reminded me of boiling crabs in California but I think the trifecta sauce might even be more delicious. Ooh... Big statement I know. The seafood here is moderately priced, coupling with very friendly staff, the angry crab shack will sooth your bad days, ironically. Get the king crab legs."}
{"text":"This place is really cool! Last night was my first time at Angry Crab and I was excited over the menu! It had way more options for those of us who just want fried shrimp and some fries :)))) . 
My family and I placed our order and spent our short wait time drawing on the table lol cool right? 
We got our food and I have to say; it was wayyyyy wayy way better than.. Ya know.. The other guy's  the shrimp was better, the little sausages were better.. a lot was better here at Angry Crab! I left stuffed and happy!
Another thing! The servers. Who was my server? We had maybe 5 different people check on us! That was really nice! 
Love this place overall. Y'all should definitely expand!! (Would love to have you in the Flagstaff area )
Thank you guys again!"}
{"text":"Wow! I absolutely loved this place! The food was fabulous, the atmosphere was awesome. My 7 year old daughter loved it too. Will def be coming back for more!!!!"}
{"text":"Either when I've had a bad day or I just need my shrimp fix, this is the place I go to. I get a pound of shrimp in their trifecta sauce, which is the perfect mix of garlic, lemon pepper, and cajun spices (without being spicy!) and I add corn and potatoes to the mix. While I wish the shrimp was beheaded, or at least de-veined, that still doesn't keep me from enjoying the meal. It hits the spot every time without breaking the bank and the quality has been consistent each time. Definitely a fan of this place."}
{"text":"Excellent menu selection coupled with tailorable flavorings make this an excellent choice for your seafood or BBQ cravings. This visit I had 1 pound of snow crab with some sausage, trifecta with ghost pepper heat. Calimari and hush puppies were our appetizers and ice cold beer to wash it down. Plenty of room here and the service was very helpful as well. Definitely worth a trip there."}
{"text":"My whole family loves this place! Every single thing we've tried, minus the Sangria that was so bad, has been amazing! My kids ask to come all of that time and we celebrate almost every special occasion there."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today. We were served by Alexa who has a quality customer service. She took her time to explain and was very pleasant at all time. I will ask for her ti serve again.

As for the food, we got catfish and hushpuppies. They both came out fairly fast. They were surprisingly good. If you like spicy food and sea food, you should check it out.  I'd love to try shrimp next time."}
{"text":"I love, Love, Love this place.  I cant get enough of it.  Fun great atmosphere and some of the best crabs ever."}
{"text":"Messy, not a great date.  Food serving has no appeal.  Food was mediocre at best.  Vegetables were soggy.  On a good note the sweet potatoes and Cajun fries were good.  There are so many other restaurants that are so much better."}
{"text":"This is more of a night out on the town type of place as opposed to a dinner location. I had family visiting from out of town and we love seafood so we decided to have a large family dinner here. It was a fun experience to get seafood in a bag that you eat from, so no plate. You get to pick your spice level which is great for a variety of palettes. When we went, it was Friday night during dinner time. It was very packed and thank goodness we had a reservation because I heard the hostess telling people 45 minutes to an hour wait.  

It should also be noted that it is VERY  loud in this bar/restaurant. Whenever there is a birthday at a table, they ring a cowbell and everyone starts howling. I felt like I was an extra in the movie \"Coyote Ugly\" every time this happened which was probably 10 times during the course of our dinner and every time it startled my four-year-old daughter. Refills and additional items needed with the meal were a rarity being that it was so busy in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Reviewers, NOTE!  You missed the best lobster in the country!  OMG, I asked for under two pounds and received the best tasting, firm and meaty lobster ever, in my 70 years, from coast-to-coast!  Seriously, for $35 I spent the next hour in pure decadence of butter-soaked lobster.   I can't say enough about the amazing taste, tenderness and 'meat' on this lobster.  My guys each had 2# shrimp and SOOO big and tasty.   Suffice it to say, we left more than happy; rather ecstatic.  
Building / Exterior - Agree, unattractive and needs a 'perk up'. 
Décor - not a fan; 
Presentation - way cool and practical beyond compare; 
Service - Adryan was excellent and supported by others in their roles.  
Food - 6 stars!
So glad to have them in Goodyear; and welcome more like them."}
{"text":"We were not disappointed.  Fun atmosphere.  Enjoyed watching families devouring buckets of seafood. My fried shrimp basket with cajun fries was prepared perfectly.  My mom said her cod basket was well executed too. The catch of the day.. scallops with garlic and pasta wonderful said my friend."}
{"text":"Best friend and I were in the area and saw this little gem. Our waitress Kina was amazing! We had no idea what we wanted or what was good. She broke down their menu and helped us decide on the amazing pork and the lobster bag! She cracked our lobster for us! Her hair is amazing and such a fun part of her fabulous personality! The manager was more then accommodating! Will be back for sure!
Make sure to get the trifecta sauce on your lobster.. and bring your friends.. it's a great place to have fun. It's clean and spacious. Great place seriously.. go eat!"}
{"text":"Downgrading my rating unfortunately, we had a pretty unfortunate experience here recently. Jk, or server was energetic and timely, it was just a series of unfortunate incidents. First, after ordering a beer the tap went out, only crap bud light available. Then we ordered the brisket dinner, told the last of it was just served. Ordered the wings, which easily took over 20 minutes. We also ordered muscles and they were awesome but by the time all of our food come or dinner party had long since finished. The worst of it was walking by someone eating the brisket on our way out. Disappointing for sure."}
{"text":"Angry Crab is great, however try to call ahead and get a reservation on weeknights.  The place can get packed and have a long wait.  My biggest complaint is that they get so busy that the service suffers. Seafood prices can be a bit high, but what do you expect from living in the middle of the desert?  The Trifecta flavoring is our favorite."}
{"text":"Hands down thee best place ever for seafood!! The first time I ate here, I was blown away at the amazing customer service, we had thee coolest waitress and the food was sooo scrumptious!! My taste buds never felt so satisfied and what shock me the most was the bill, after all the terrific service and gratifying food, our bill was soo affordable, we left a huge tip to show how please with everything!!! We came back a second time, once again the service was amazing the food was delicious!! The Angry Crab Shack & BBQ is impeccable with its service and food!! Absolutely Love this Place!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place, excellent food, attentive, knowledgeable and fun wait staff.  Been there several times, have tried different things ... everything has been well above expectation.  Yes, the boil-bags CAN BE MESSY ... but, just plan for it, and dive in!.  Definitely a recommendation, and I can't wait to to back again."}
{"text":"Went here Sunday, and it will be my last visit. After the waiter to us they were out of almost everything, we Ordered  five pounds of snow crab. Upon receiving it the waiter only brought us small child's sizers to open them. They were completely out of crackers. It would have been nice to know this prior to ordering $100 worth of crab legs. My boyfriend ordered a Dos XX and was warm. I am giving it one star because the bloody marry was amazing. After getting home my boyfriend and I were up all night with stomach aches.  Not happy that we spent $150 on a meal that was a pain to enjoy. How can a restaurant that's name has crab in it not have ANY crackers. The waiter was nice enough to stand there and cut some open with sizers but it made the dining experience awkward because we had him standing over us while we tried to eat. I'm tempted to call and ask for a refund. The waiter said you get 10% off if you bring your own crackers or tools. I don't recommend this place. It's like ordering a steak and the waiter telling you they don't have steak knifes and handing you sizers instead."}
{"text":"Just had lunch there with my daughter and my grandson the most beautiful experience I've had at lunch however the food and staff were outstanding highly recommend this place can't wait to go back. Also Amanda was our server what a great experience with her thank you Amanda"}
{"text":"Consistently bad service and quality of food seems to be getting worse. I enjoy the one on Alma School, but this one is much closer. I've given it a number of chances, chalking it up to a bad day. But three times in a row the food had been disappointing and the service has been awful. Last visit our order came out wrong. Another server fixed it. Not tools were given for the crabs/shrimp. Another server got them for us. Needed a box. Went and got it myself. Tried to get the check. Asked a different server. Then the hostess. Finally someone brought it over and cashed us out. Never saw the server. Get it together."}
{"text":"Can't wait to come back. Super good and filling. Will for sure order shrimp again, probably try lobster too."}
{"text":"Deep fried goodness! I was hoping they had a better beer selection lol and some beignets ! The cajun fries were finger licking good"}
{"text":"Nice place but messy food. Good quality but not cheap."}
{"text":"More like 2.5 stars but rounding up to 3. Came here with my mom, uncle and grandmother for dinner. We got there around 7:30 and the hostess stand was packed. We dropped my grandmother, who is 85, off at the door with my uncle while my mom and I parked. By the time we got inside my grandmother had already put her name on the list. She was quoted a 30-40 minute wait, so she found a seat right by the hostess stand. 15 mins later I realize everyone around us who came in after us had already been seated. When we approached the hostess stand to ask what the deal was, the young girl says \"we've been looking for you, your table has been ready for a while\". Oh really? You looked for us? We were sitting literally 3 feet from you the whole time. Not a great experience off the bat. Word to the management: your host staff needs some training. Not all of your guests will have a cell phone and it would be helpful if the first person your customers come in contact with has some amount of common sense. 

Once we were seated things got better. Our waitress Kayla was attentive and super helpful in explaining the menu. This place is very similar to Boiling Crab, which I've been to, but the rest of my party was unfamiliar. We ordered a lb of shrimp, lb of mussels and a lb of the snow crab with the trifecta spicy level 1. We also got hush puppies, sweet potato fries and a fried cod basket. All of the fried stuff was delicious. The hush puppies were spicy, the inside moist and outside crunchy. Sweet potato fries were crispy. The boiled seafood was okay but not great. The shrimp were overdone and really hard to peel. Out of the 25 or so mussels we got, 7 of them didn't open (30%!!!). Really the only thing that was really good out of the seafood we got was the crab. 

Overall this was better than Red Lobster, but it wasn't great and I have no real desire to go back."}
{"text":"This place is a dump.  Been going here for a while and under new management it has gone down hill.  Food service bartenders all are TERRIBLE...  AVOID THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"Pretty good place. Really enjoyed how they celebrate birthdays here lol. About food, great food the cat. 1 of spice for the bag is not hot AT ALL!! So hope this helps anybody out there but enjoyable place to hang out with friends. It got messy!"}
{"text":"You know it's a 5 star kind of meal when you can't stop thinking about it.
This place is seafood heaven.
They have about 6 locations in the valley take your pick.
Do not miss out on this awesomeness.

We got the Dungeness trifecta which is cajun, lemon pepper and garlic (level 3 I can't feel my lips HOT) with corn on the Cobb, red potatoes and some bread for sopping.
They have levels of spice from 0 to 5 and many different sauces to choose from.
The combination is phenomenal you will not be disappointed.
Service was okay but the food blew my mind.

Seafood is priced by the pound our crab was under 2 pounds and came to $40 which is quite reasonable.
For the corn, potatoes and bread they charge separately.

I'm definitely going back.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Very very good!  I always get the king crap legs and I have never had a complaint.  Corn bread is good, vegetables and pretty much anything."}
{"text":"Just good, so good. Damn good. Lordy, I am thankful this place exists. 

I guess I'm more wimpy than I thought, because I was happy with the mild level 1 spice! My love and I got a shrimp bag with potatoes, cornbread, and hush puppies. That pacific rim sauce was the BOMB. We'll be coming back to try the lobster for sure! Our server, Emma, was the epitome of excellent service. If you go there and get seated in Emma's section, sit back and relax becuz you're in capable hands. Sitting outside in a nice breeze with the messiest, most flavorful shrimp with my hubby was a fantastic experience and I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times in the last month or so and have ordered a variety of menu items. Everything is dusted with a cajun seasoning that is really good and has the right amount of spice. The first time I was there I ordered the crawfish with trifecta seasoning and it was really good, basically peel your own crawfish in a garlicky spicy sauce. It is served in a plastic bag and the bag had a chemically odor, probably from the heat of the crawfish which was kind of off putting to me. Another time we ordered the catfish, which was awesome! I can't say a single thing bad about the food although the service seems disorganized. There area a couple of wait staff that are super helpful. Then others that will avoid making eye contact so not to help you... yeah talking to you lady with the butterflies in your hair! 
The food makes the meh service tolerable."}
{"text":"LOVE Angry Crab & BBQ! I come here about once per month and always have great service and awesome food. There's no other place like this around and I hope the location is open forever in the future! Although I would LOVE more locations but I'll take what I can get. 

I usually split one Lb of trifecta shrimp with my Bf(it is plenty) and add sausage, corn and potatoes. SOMETIMES we even venture and get the sinful Mac & cheese (its soooo good) but not always. I love that this location has the bbq piece so the food is really kicked up an extra notch. 

The beers are always cold and the fast pace loud environment is always fun and upbeat. 

Don't come here if you don't like loud places. 

Keep up the great work Angry Crab & BBQ!"}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time yesterday. I will say that I don't eat seafood but my husband does and was wanting some crab legs, but we went here since they offered sandwiches too and he's been wanting crab. Since it was a Tuesday, I didn't expect them to be busy and they really weren't. In our seating area, there were only 2 other tables but there may have been a couple of table on the other side too. Our waiter came by quickly and we got our drinks quick as well, and ordered our food. After that, it went south... Our food started to come out, my husband got the crabs with the Trifecta seasoning and the mild spice. He wishes he had gone a little hotter on the spice but he liked the crab and the trifecta. I got a plain buffalo chicken sandwich (technically a po' boy but since I didn't want anything on it, I just call it a sandwich). Well, according to our waiter they messed up the first one and put everything on it, so he had them remake it and came and let us know. Which I appreciate! Downside is I waited probably an additional 20min for that stupid sandwich... 2 chicken strips on a bun. My husband was almost done eating by the time I got my food! Also, the place isn't very organized... while waiting for my sandwich, someone brought us fries. Well, my husband had ordered fries with his meal (he never got them- I believe our waiter forgot to add them to the order) and fries also came with my sandwich. So I thought they were bringing me that to eat while waiting. Wrong! They were plain, and cold, and were meant for another table, we later found out. Then they brought us hot, seasoned fries that were decent. My husband also got hushpuppies but wasn't a fan. Our waiter did comp my sandwich (I didn't even ask) but still, for the amount of time we were there, and for how slow they were, I expected better. 

If you love crab/seafood, go there. If not, stay away as there's nothing for you! We do plan on trying another location that offers BBQ as well and hope it'll be a better experience for us both."}
{"text":"This was our 2nd time here.  We came last week in the evening and loved the atmosphere of the restaurant.  We were greeted warmly and escorted to a table quickly. The first time was great...loved the waitress, who enthusiastically explained about the restaurant, the food and how it would be served.  We had super fast service and a great experience all around.  The food is super!  I had the pound of shrimp with the Kajun sauce and corn on the cob. The shrimp were huge, heads and tails still on and swimming in wonderful spicy sauce.  My husband had the snow crab and corn on the cob and he loved it.
However, we took our friends for lunch yesterday because we had such a great experience the first time.  We were excited to take them to, what we thought was, a fun restaurant.
We all walked in and the staff were all standing around talking with each other, as the restaurant was not very crowded.  We stood there for awhile, and finally I started to walk towards them, when a young man asked to seat us.   He sat us down and were handed menus and immediately left.  Several minutes later someone else, our waiter, came over to take our drink orders and asked if we had been there before.  Our friends had not, and while waiting were upset because we couldn't see the prices for the shellfish menu.  We had forgotten that the prices were on the back of the napkin holder.  He turned it around, then left.  He came back to take our order, still not talking too much about the experience of the restaurant.   We had all ordered the shellfish, so when he brought our bags, I believe he pretty much dropped them on the table.  He then put a bucket in the middle of the table and walked away, without so much as a comment made.  We had to ask for gloves, which he tossed on the table, about 15 pair, more than we needed and from there on we didn't see anyone until it was time to pay.  The evening of our first visit the music was fun and lively, but this afternoon, it was loud and hip-hop.   The food was great, again, but the service was totally lacking in friendly, welcoming service.  We probably will not return, unfortunately, due to the service and lack of enthusiasm for a unique dining experience by your staff, neither will our friends."}
{"text":"Incredible. 5 hours later I'm still thinking of how amazing this place was. I'm telling everybody to go here asap! We got frog legs, raw oysters (extremely fresh), the Monday bag with trivecta sauce on #2 heat. The heat level is hot. Don't try to be a boss and get level 4 you will regret it!  #2 heat was perfect.  Also got beans and fries , dipped the fries in the trifecta sauce. Yum yum. Coming back on sunday!!"}
{"text":"Fun place for sure.  At first it was weird that you eat out of a \"feed bag\" but then it was a real hoot!  Service was great I gave it 4 stars because it was quite noisy but the design of the restaurant lends itself to that.  Definitely worth visiting."}
{"text":"Rarely do I ever give 5 stars to anyplace. This place is the exception. The cocktails were good and reasonable. The food was delicious and prices reasonable. I had snow crab legs. They were great. Full of meat with a buttery garlic sauce. Corn and a potato. My friends had oysters they enjoyed. One had chicken the other Shrimp that were succulent with the trifecta sauce. The wait staff that we encountered were wonderful! The front manager showed us to our table. Her name is Vanessa and she was fabulous. She came back around and spoke to us later. Then Sampson took our order. He was so patient explaining everything, how it worked, very solicitous. Then he had to leave and Christine took over. Also very nice and made sure we had everything we needed. As I said Vanessa came and talked to us. The people working at this location made the already great food extra special. I would highly recommend this restaurant and this location to anyone looking for seafood in the valley. It was a fun place lots of vitality to go with the food!"}
{"text":"I am from Va. Beach, VA. Seafood central, and I really enjoyed this place. I had snowcrab legs & a bag of mixed veggies with the traditional boil. Super awesome. The crabs were cooked perfect! They slid out in one complete piece, meaning they were cooked to right. Makes for a crab sit down that much better. My only suggestion would be to offer old bay by itself as an option. Could have been one and I simply missed it. I love to mix a wee bit of old bay into melted butter for my shrimp and crab. Super impressed Angry Crab! Super impressed. I grew up on the beach and in the bay, still live there, and can name several local joints that can't hold a claw to your food :)! I will definitely be back when I come to visit next year!"}
{"text":"Finally tried out AC and the only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is due to lack of service we received. Our food was absolutely outstanding and tasted amazing! Unfortunately our server Amber was no where to be found. We ordered a pound of crab and a pound of crawfish with a few appetizers and sides. Our crab and crawfish came out within 10 minutes of ordering which was great. Our server asked us if we would like butter, lemon or limes to go with and we said yes. About 20 minutes go by and not even any acknowledgement from our server as we tried to catch her many times. She was tending to the table behind us and all the tables around us. She finally came by 30 minutes later and asked how the food was. We let her know we never received our butter or any of our other dishes and asked if they would be on the way. She clearly forgot to put in the other food. By then our crab was already gone and our drinks had been empty and we told her to just forget the butter. We received our other dishes within 5 minutes and the gumbo and cornbread were incredible. About another 20 minutes go by and our server has not even come by to check on us at all. The hostess actually came by to let us know she would be bringing our check and not even seconds later a buser brought us our check and picked it up. I was just absolutely shocked that our server didn't even come by or make an effort to increase the service she was providing us. It was really upsetting to see every table around us be catered to and we sat there unnoticed for an hour...... The only reason I would go back here is for the food."}
{"text":"Seriously though, how can you charge $15 for a tiny thing deep fried stuck between 2 pieces of bread?"}
{"text":"Only time I've ever been happy to get crabs. The mussels garlic/lemon pepper/lvl 2 IS AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Born & raised in Cali Im used to the best seafood there is! I was bummed to know AZ didn't have a BC... In search of sum thing similar we found this place and OMG so glad we did!!!! We were seated immediately (No waiting time) our server Tyson was great but the shrimp & king crab was absolutely finger licking good! It was as if i was back in Cali!!!  I MUST BE BACK!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not what I expected (FLAVOR WISE) 
-NO WAIT TIME IN MOTHERS DAY! Yay!
-Super Nice Servers 
-Ordered the Trifecta Shrimp and in all honesty it lacked flavor it was very bland! I think that if you have ever gone to Boiling Crab in California nothing else comes close. It was edible but its a flavor I wouldn't crave. A bit disappointed"}
{"text":"It was out first time here so we all got something different and shared so we could all experience a little bit of everything. I got the snow crab legs and they were fabulous with the trifecta seasoning. My husband got the shrimp it was good but just a pain to eat since all the deveining and peeling had to be done on your own. My brother got the sliders they were not that great, too dry. Our friend got the gumbo it was super delish. Service was good. Food, overall was tasty, I'd go back!"}
{"text":"Super tasty food!  Had the fish-n-chips and the brisket sandwich.  Both were excellent...and the cajun fries disappeared quick!  Looks like a great selection of beer.  We sat at the bar and the service was excellent"}
{"text":"I'm so glad and excited that we have a seafood joint here in AZ just like boiling crab, we don't have to drive to Cali just to get our boiling crab fix. The place is huge it has a lot of tables. I like how they have picnic tables outside for the people waiting when the place gets packed. Service was good, our server (Austin) was very patient and accommodating. We ordered 2lbs of shrimp, trifecta, no spice but when it got to our table, I changed my mind and i wanted to add spice to it, he was very nice to exchange it and was not bothered. Then, when it came to our table the second time, i felt the bag is cold and we tried the shrimp, it was a little under cooked, we have to return it again so they can cook it more. I appreciated all he has done for our great dining experience. The sauce is not too salty compared to boiling crab and they have better crispier fresh Cajun fries! I Love it! My mom was excited to hear about this place! I will bring her here on her birthday."}
{"text":"I'm so glad that they open.. finally! This would be the closest one for me since I live in Litchfield Park. Anyways, our visit was satisfying and fun! Susan & Jeff were very accommodating to us, they made sure that our needs were met. We order the same food every time we eat at Angry Crab. Shrimp & clams trifecta mild (not on the photos). It's good and juicy. The rice were perfectly cooked, not under or over cooked. My brother ordered the chicken tenders and onion rings. We went on a weekday around 5pm and it was not that busy. I also want to spread the word that they are now open for lunch!!! As of 3/7/16."}
{"text":"Last night I went to the Angry Crab with my best friend, her family and my dad.  I rarely write restaurant reviews, but last night, we had the BEST time.   Jeff was out waiter and he was super attentive. Service was fantastic.  Food was amazing.   We all drove to 28th / Indian School from North and Central Phoenix, opted against Pappadeaux as we wanted something a little more casual.  Angry Crab was perfect.   We had the happy hour Shrimp Cocktail (a must have with the atomic horseradish), calamari, pulled pork on Poore Bros potato chips, fried clams, alligator, oysters, crawfish, crab, grilled mahi...and OMG it was all amazing.    

Thank YOU JEFF for making the birthday dinner a super special one.   Angry Crab ROCKS!!!"}
{"text":"If you like Hot 'n Juicy Crawfish in Vegas, you will like Angry Crab Shack. We stopped by here to get something to go for dinner and left with 2 bags of spicy marinated seafood!

The waitress at the counter was very friendly and helpful as she explained the ordering process. Basically, you pick out how many lbs. of seafood you want from the menu, and decide on what sauces and spiciness level you want your food. Sides are also available, such as corn on the cob, sweet potato fries, and gumbo.

We ordered 1 lb. of shrimp ($12), 1 lb. of snow crab ($15), corn on the cob, and sweet potato fries. We went with the trifecta sauce and the penultimate \"Hot\" spicy level.

The shrimp were huge, and served in the shell, head on. Peeling them was no problem though. The snow crab were a little harder to crack open (Obviously), and the meat inside was a little bland and needed that extra kick from the sauce to make it tasty.

The sauce was a good mixture of salty, spicy, lemony heat, especially with the shrimp. The corn on the cob came in the bag and was really tasty since it was marinating in the seafood juices and sauce. The sweet potato fries were good as well and a nice side with the rest of the meal.

I'll definitely be coming back here to try out more of their seafood by the pound!"}
{"text":"Compared to the Angry Crab Shack in Mesa, this location has ample seating, and also offers bbq! What a great combination. We ventured in and were promptly seated. After poring through the menu, we decided on a combination of 1 lb. trifecta hot shrimp and 1 lb. of pulled pork with hot bbq sauce. The shrimp were just as good as the Mesa location, with quite a bit of heat to them at the \"hot\" level (Level 3 of 5 heat levels I believe). The pulled pork had a nice smoked flavor and the bbq sauce complimented it well. Although the shrimp and the pork were both ordered at the same spiciness level, the shrimp did taste spicier, and I ended up eating so much spicy food that my palate turned numb!

Service was prompt and the waitress was superb in quickly refilling our drinks, a very important service to provide when your mouth feel like its on fire from the spiciness of the food!

After you've made a total mess of yourself from eating tasty seafood and bbq, there is a very convenient washing \"trough\" where you can wash up and towel off after your meal. 

The bathroom is where I had to dock a few points. It was pretty dirty, and there were suspicious yellow stains lining the upper part of the stall walls. Hmm.... I got in and out of there as soon as possible!

Overall though, this is definitely a spot I'll be coming back to!"}
{"text":"Love the oysters and the staff. I am actually a regular here. They also have these amazing char'd oysters that are cooked with a Parmesan crust and garlic bread. 

The drinks are awesome too"}
{"text":"Great place to stuff your face.
One of my favorite places to eat in all of Phoenix!  Great food, fun atmosphere, and good service.  One of the best Cajun restaurants I have been to outside of New Orleans.  Only wish they served fried green tomatoes."}
{"text":"Have had dinner here twice. The first time had the Dungeness crab and shrimp boils.  Delicious shrimp, tasty and succulent. The crab was not as wonderful. Having been from San Francisco, we have eaten A LOT of  Dungeness crab. This was a little mushy (well more than a little). 
The second time here, we skipped the crab and had the shrimp boil and added the clam boil, both were very good.
We will return in the future.
If you decide to visit the Angry Crab, be prepared for a messy good time. Also, if you don't order carefully, you can end up packing on way too many calories!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this place and it was fun! We were celebrating grandmas birthday. Everything went very well from our server to our whole overall experience. We were excited and getting ready to tip a touch over 20% for it all.  Then we noticed the server added in her own tip. There were only 5 of us. 3 adults and 2 children. The menu clearly states parties of 6 or more will be added.  She cheated herself out of a good tip from us. Grandma and I used to be servers and couldn't believe the gall!!  Hence my 1 star rating. My advice: check your bill.


Since this incident, I was contacted by the general manager very quickly to rectify the situation and offered a partial refund. He was very willing to make ammends. Thank you Angry Crab!"}
{"text":"Stopped in the other night for a quick meal and once again, they nailed it.  Taylor, our server was awesome!  She kept a close watch and checked in throughout the meal to make sure everything was good.  The food was hot, fresh, and delicious!  I just wish they could learn to make decent cole slaw!  The baked beans are fantastic, but sometimes I just want a tasty cole slaw with my fish!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I don't love seafood- at all! And the BBQ is good, but super fatty! I did love all the spices!! We had the BEST server Nick that made our night!! The whole atmosphere & concept of messy eating in a bag was awesome! Loved the bibs. SO while the food wasn't my favorite I loved everything else! If you love seafood I highly, highly recommend this experience!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was average at best.  We were immediately put off by our waitress's shirt being filthy, stained, and full of holes. Her attitude was blasé, and really seemed put out that she was working here.  Looking around, nobody at any of the tables are smiling, and it really feels gloomy in here.  Not the ambiance I would expect for the prices they're charging.  

To the management, For Gods sake, please check your wait staffs attire, and make sure they're clothes are clean or at the very least, not full of holes.  

Not likely to be coming back here."}
{"text":"Not bad.  After trying several places in Mississippi,  i feel like this place could fit in other there. I liked the shrimp I had.  

Overall this place is great for any occasion. I saw a small party drinking and I saw families and couples from young to old. 

The food is greasy, but thats not a bad thing.  Many of the local mexican places also have greasy food, but if your health conscious look elsewhere.

It's worth checking out if you like seafood."}
{"text":"This place was awesome for a seafood fix. The crab legs where amazing. The staff was very helpful as it was my first time. Be prepared to get messy. Recommend getting rice and dumbing it on the table. Then pour the shrimp and sauce over it and dig in."}
{"text":"Finally a seafood boil-in-a-bag in Arizona! Prices are a lot better than you would think. 
I love that the shrimp and crawfish they serve here are plump and juicy. For those who don't want to go the bag route, they have fried options too. Flavors are great and they have a lot of extras like Cajun fries, cornbread, etc. 
Great food that keeps both your stomach and your wallet full."}
{"text":"Having lived in Louisiana for some time and learning to cook there I was skeptical about a Cajun seafood boil in AZ. I was gravely mistaken!!  This pace is set to look like a fish shack, it's noisy, you can draw on the tables, the staff are fun. The food, well you just cannot go wrong!! We had Alligator bites to start with an almost Remoulade dipping sauce, spicy and good. My partner had the mussels w bread. These were some of the largest cleanest mussels I have ever tasted. Very very good. I had shrimp w potatoes and sausage. This was what I call a Low Country Boil. I selected the Trifecta for the sauce and medium heat for the spice. These are I'm guessing 15-18 count shrimp cooked w heads and done just right! The sausage was spicy and good! Probably would pass on the potatoes next time. Loved this place!! Here is a tip, the sauces are very messy and the concept is to eat with your hands. They will provide a fork if you ask or you can get gloves. Prepare to get messy and enjoy some great seafood!!"}
{"text":"If you like a Louisiana/deep south Crab and Seafood Shack atmosphere where you drink beer from the bottle and eat with your hands, GO HERE! If you are thinking Ocean Club do not go here. The venue is rustic, its intended that way, you will get your hands messy, and you will enjoy it! Have been to two locations and this one is my fav. You sit at a table with a paper cloth and markers, feel free to practice your art or graffiti, whatever. Basically you select your seafood protein, select the sauce for it to be steamed in, then select the heat level.(medium is hot). Add veggies bread hushpuppies etc. Enjoy a cold Fresh Squeezed IPA and suddenly your waiter appears with a \"Boil in Bag\" full of crustacean, or fish  goodness. You eat with your hands here but they pre open the mussels( which are amazing) shrimp are large and tasty. Great bread and the hushpuppies have a bit of pepper in them for a South Western kick.

TIP: If you don't want to get messy ask for gloves when they bring your bib!!

Relax and enjoy, it is a wonderful place!"}
{"text":"Nice place, but waitress didn't know about the menu, had to go and ask and took her a long time to come back and take the order, we ordered bbq, big mistake! It was cold, not tasty at all, bbq sauce was anything but bbq sauce, 1 slice of bread on a big order I shared with my husband. Definitely won't be going back to try anything else. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food was very good, service staff attentive and on the ball,  crab bag I had was REALLY TASTY!!! Tried a little of the catfish and the coating was very good! Monday is a good day to since you can sample a couple of items for $20 in the bag! Just remember to wear the bib!"}
{"text":"This place is great, A little pricey but good!
Remember everything you order I ala carte! :O)   Wait staff and bartenders are fun!"}
{"text":"Probably deserves 4.5 stars, but I'll round up to five. Pretty dang tasty grub, though I have had better. Pretty reasonable prices and friendly efficient service."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. I had the raw oysters on the half shell. Absolutely amazing price 12 for $16. I also had the king crab that was very good. Definitely feel like I got the amount I should have. Potatoes and sausage were good too but let's be honest no one care about that stuff. The seafood was great. My boyfriend had the lobster and he loved it. Great quality and quanity. Service was amazing. We not only had our waitress but other staff as well that asked how we were doing. Wait time was great. However we did come at around 3:45 in the afternoon on a Sunday. But it was by no means slow. So overall I will come back on a regular basis when I am in the area. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Shrimp shrimp shrimp throw some crab legs and Cajun fries and you have the best seafood In arizona. Who knew you could get that down home Louisiana seafood taste so far from the water. This place has changed the face of seafood.

There may be a line out the door and your hands are going get messy but this place will rival any."}
{"text":"Amazing staff and food! This location not only has delicious seafood, but mouthwatering ribs and melt in your mouth briskett. Fun environment for a night out."}
{"text":"Not great. Gumbo was just okay, Po' Boy was soggy and also just okay. The seafood seems fresh enough, but the dishes don't have a lot of flavor."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS A WINNER.  Ambiance: check (loud, fun, rowdy).  Service: check (everyone is friendly, funny, helpful).  Food: check, check, check.  We've been to the other Crab Shack many times.  NO comparison.  We started with Kajun Shrimp to share as an appetizer: crunchy, spicy, and delicious.  Esposa and I each got a bag o' snow crab, sausage, taters, and corn.  OMG.  Not enough superlatives to describe the addictive combination.  Perfect in every way.  OVERALL: STELLAR.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  Next time we visit the Gilbert/Mesa area, we'll make sure to stop at ACS."}
{"text":"We came into this new location bc it is very close to our home. I would have to say that this place is just OK- it is incredibly loud inside, I think it has something to do with the wood walls that amplify the sound. The menu was also very confusing! It is overload to the eyes and very difficult to understand. Very cluster and disorganized. 

As for the food- it was on the expensive side and the portions were small. I do have to say, the flavor was good and the meat quality was good."}
{"text":"I am so excited to have a place like this in the tukee. Seafood + BBQ= my kind of place. Our first visit was great. We had lunch time BBQ. The food was fast and tasted amazing. I will be back to try more soon!"}
{"text":"I'd Ike to thank the manager of Angry Crab for inviting us back to try other dishes.  We definitely had a much better experience on the second dinner date. The first time we had a Po-Boy sandwich and a bowl of gumbo.  The gumbo was yummy but the sandwich not so much. 

We went back and ordered what this place is really known for: the Seafood Boils! All was great.  The crawfish were tiny and I would not recommend that seafood.  But everything else was yummy.  And the server Chris was wonderful.  Food tasted perfectly seasoned with \"trifecta\"."}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong here. Everyone gets their seafood fix & the restaurant is clean. Very fun atmosphere. One of our family's favorite places to go!"}
{"text":"Seated quickly, server attended us quickly. 

We were given sodas that were flat, literally, it's like a bottle was left open all night and used for drinks. It wasn't just the coke it was the Dr. PEPPER also.

Secondly, we decided to order cajun fries 10 minutes after placing our order, unfortunately we didn't get fires till about half hour later and our food was done, on top of that they were just regular fries.

So that's the bad...

The good was 2 lbs of shrimp in Trifecta seasoning, the kiddo had sliders she liked. Can't knock the food, it was good. I'll be back for a 2nd go, maybe today was just an off day."}
{"text":"As a transplant from the south I've not been able to find fresh crawfish anywhere. I was surprised to when the waitress offered to bring me a live crawfish to inspect. I bought a lb and it was so yummy. Coupled with an Abita beer I felt like I was back in the south enjoying a crawfish boil. So yummy. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to stop by here for a good long while now, and I can honestly say that last night was worth the wait. We came here for a later dinner, and were amazed at how much business they were doing. After a prompt greeting, we were seated, and our enthusiastic server (I think his name was CJ?) talked us through the menu. We ordered some sodas, looked over the menu, and decided on dinner. I wanted to get the Dungeness crab, but they were out, so I opted for the King crab. My girlfriend ordered the fried cod, and we decided to split an order of the grilled oysters that were on special. 

The place was busy without being loud, and it had a really cool look on the inside. The sort of place that you can just kick back at, know what I'm sayin'? People have written all over the walls, and it looks like everyone is having a great time. It's easy to get sucked into the vibe here, and that's exactly what they want you to do.

Our food came out, and it looked great. The cod came on a bed of tasty fries, which were slightly breaded and perfectly crispy. The cod itself was really nice also- crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. And the crab... dear god the crab!!! Served in a big plastic bag, dripping in delicious sauce and spices... I've never had crab quite like this before, but I knew that I was in for a treat. I got the trifecta sauce, spice level 2. It had just enough tingle to be noticeable without overpowering the crab flavor, but the sauce was DAMNED tasty. Then our oysters came out, and I was amazed by the plumpness of them. These were some fat-ass oysters! They had some parmesan and tomato topping, with little pieces of bread that were great for sopping up the last bits in the shells. Honestly I'm not sure that I've ever had oysters that fat before, and they were amazing.

So we ate. And ate. And ate. The king crab was perfectly cooked, and was easy to get out of the shell. One of the great things about king crab is that you pull out these enormous logs of crabmeat from the legs, and this was definitely a perfect example. An added bonus is that they cut the crab at the base of the body so that you have access to that really good meat at the joints, which is some of the best eatin' you'll find on these bugs. All in all, I was thoroughly impressed, and I'm notoriously picky when it comes to my crustaceans.

So when our meal was done, I knew that I had JUST enough room left to try one more thing without feeling like a slobbitty McSlobberson. So we decided to order a bag of shrimp on the hottest level (Angry Ghost, I think?). They came out, and once again I was amazed by the size of the little fuckers. These were some PRAWNS, daddy-o! Big ol' chunkymunky prawns with the head still attached. Easily shelled, they were big enough to take in two bites. And the sauce was delicious. A little spicy, and I don't think I'd get it THAT spicy again because it overpowers the seafood taste, but the taste of the sauce is delicious enough to hold it's own. Splitting that bag left us both feeling satisfied, and we left with big ol' smiles on our faces.

One noteworthy part of the experience was the service. Our server was really happy and enthusiastic, and seemed to be thoroughly enjoying what he was doing. He'd stop by every so often for a chat, but it never felt like he was 'hovering'- more like a buddy just popping by that say hi and refill our sodas. When the bill came out, I was a little surprised- I thought that it would have been more expensive. All in all, this place was fantastic and the only reason that I didn't give it five stars is because they were out of Dungeness (apparently it runs out FAST). I don't hold that against them at all, but I can't in good conscience give a place five stars without trying their Dungeness. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We come here at least once a week.  I love this place, they food is always consistently good.  I've been to other places w/ this same concept and they don't quit measure up, so far this is the only place that offer gloves to their guest.  I didn't know how much i appreciated this, until i went to a place that didn't offer them, and i had a cut on my finger.  Definitely recommend, it's worth a try for sure!"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time here. The first time we were there with my girlfriends family in a large group. Most of them didn't speak English, it was a large Mexican family. Had a horrible experience with one of the racist servers there. Anyways, we all have bad experiences and bad days but the food was good so my girlfriend and I decided to go back. This review is based off of my second visit there.

We had 2 lbs of shrimp, and 1 lb of snowcrab with some sides. Food was good, didn't taste as fresh as the last time but still pretty good.

The problem occurred when I ordered 1lb of clams. I am a sushi chef and restaurant owner so I know what I expected when I ordered clams. We orders 1lb clam with potato and sausage. When the clams arrived at our table I opened the bag and started sifting through the bag of empty clam shells. I've eaten about 3 little clams before I noticed most of the clam shells were empty. I took out all of the empty shells from the bag because I figured the meat has probably just fallen off into the bag with all the sauce etc. After I had taken out all of the empty shells I went through the bag and sauce to find all of the clam meat. There was a total of maybe 10 clam meats. The bag itself contained about 2 dozen clams. Maybe they fell off during the cooking process?

Anyways I had notified the server and I showed him the empty shells and tried to explain that most of the shells were empty and wasn't in the bag either. He looked a bit annoyed and said he would get me another 1lb. I told him politely no it's okay I'm getting a little full anyways and we had to leave. When he came back I realized they forgot the sausage too so I told him and he stared at me and told me they already took 50% off that bag so.... \"shrug\" ? I wasn't looking for a discounted meal, I just wanted them to notify whoever made it so it doesn't happen to someone else??

The bill came to a little over $70. We had a gift card for $40 so I put that in with my credit card. He saw the gift card and took it to the manager was was talking to him for a while while looking towards our table. I'm sure he was just trying to verify the gift card wasn't fake or was valid? We felt very uncomfortable. After a while he came back, I just took the check, left a $30 tip and left.

I've been to many restaurants where food or service was horrible. This place wasn't even bad compared to other experiences but for some reason both times I left this place feeling like I wasn't welcome at all.

Food 3.0 to 3.5 depending on the day
Service 1 (maybe just back luck with our servers)
The lady that dropped by our table a few times in between was nice though.

Time to find a new spot"}
{"text":"If you don't know how to tear apart a lobster or crawfish, this isn't the place to go. If you are on a fancy date, this isn't the place to go. If you value, to any degree, the clothes you are wearing, this isn't the place to go.

So toss on a crappy T-shirt and old jeans before you get down on some amazing boil-in-bag seafood. I highly recommend the lobster, crawfish and king crab legs -- all in trifecta sauce (garlic butter, lemon pepper and Cajun spices). 

Angry Crab sells its food at market price and by the pound, so you choose how much you really want to spend. Also, nobody is going to yank that tail off the lobster for you or peel your shrimp. You're going to get  your hands dirty. 


Remember to order an appetizer of charred oysters, especially if you like to pile on the garlic.

My date and I had a 1.8 pound lobster, a pound of crawfish and 6 charred oysters for about $50. And the service we received from Michele was phenomenal."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for about 2 years now. Typically we make it in for special occasions. Me and my GF always get the pound of shrimp with the trifecta flavoring. It's always amazing! The service is always great even when it gets a little busy. We're bud light drinkers and the beer is decently priced. So in short, we LOVE this place. BUT...since our last visit last week, we now have a huge BUT!

During our last visit, which was last Friday, we immediately noticed that the shrimp was different. It was significantly smaller, it was now split down the middle and \"cleaned\". I didn't mind that the shrimp was now \"cleaned out\". I actually prefer it that way. However, the shrimp felt extremely low quality. It didn't feel \"hearty\" and meaty. Like I said, it was very small shrimp and felt as if it wasn't fully cooked. Very rubbery. We make shrimp all the time at home and the shrimp that Angry Crab was now using was consistent with being low quality.
We even asked our server, who was Dil, and he confirmed that the shrimp was different. 

It was very disappointing and our party of 4 all agreed that it was no longer the same Angry Crab we know and love. How unfortunate. We just couldn't justify the $30-$50 checks that we usually get at the end of our meal for these \"changes\". 
I'll be trying other Crab/Shrimp spots in the east valley."}
{"text":"I like this place but they quit selling Alaskan Amber. What does it take to get that back on tap?  Do I need to do quit coming here?"}
{"text":"Can I find me some Crawfish in AZ please?! I guess I can! Down side, they were out when I got there, so I have to go back lol! Drink specials are awesome, a lot of different sea food dishes to choose from, great atmosphere, fun and upbeat. This place seems to be very busy all the time so get there early, sit at the bar, or be ready to wait just a bit. Napkins in your collar, paper on the tables, gettin dirty while you eat with your hands kind of experience. I have to say its not as good as the seafood I've had down in Houston, but still pretty good. Make sure you try an order of the Hush Puppies!"}
{"text":"This one in phoenix has bbq and seafood which is great if you have non-seafood eaters in the family. The pulled pork was smokey and delish, coleslaw was not so great. Could have used more dressing, a little dry for my taste, but I guess some people like it like that. The seafood was interesting with lots of choices of sauces to go with it. Service was very good an attentive even though it was busy."}
{"text":"Best Cajun food I've ever had. The trifecta is incredible! Amazing atmosphere and they have the best service! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Always good.. most the time I have the King Crab Legs, Trifecta Sauce #2, with the mixed Vegetables in a Sweet and Tangy #1... this time I tried the Happy Hour Clams and Calamari Basket and Shrimp Cocktail, then had some Brisket... I must say, not bad. Wet.. if you like it that way..  highly recommend this place!!! Mike and Tim take care of you at the bar!!!"}
{"text":"So first I must say that our service was fantastic!  We were greeted immediately upon entering and got there early enough to be seated immediately.  Our server David was very patient with us as we were first-timers and took time to explain the menu options and answer all questions.  We were served promptly, which was nice.  The seafood was very good.  I'm not sure we'd be back for the BBQ though.  It was okay, but not well seasoned and  I was sorely disappointed to find jalapeño in my Mac and Cheese.  I'm sure some like that, which is fine, but I just feel like that's odd enough to warrant being disclosed either on the menu or by the waiter.  Overall a good experience!"}
{"text":"The food is why I gave it a three. The food is a 5 but the service wasn't great and I've eaten snow crab all over the country and this wasn't a pound  don't think it was worth the price"}
{"text":"I would eat a shoe if you put it in their Trifecta Sauce!!! Everything was amazing, but the 2 best things I had was the Shrimp & the Hush Puppies. The Frog Legs were great too! I'll never go to Red Lobster again! When you gotta have seafood, you gotta go to Angry Crab Shack!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was great and our server Jeff M was awesome!! Was our first time there and it was a great experience!!"}
{"text":"Fresh tasty seafood. Reasonably priced. Menu has Great selection. This place is really cool. Maybe not ideal for first date lol. It's very loud that's why. 
The Trifecta effect sauce is very delicious and reminds me of a traditional steam bag bake. 

Awesome place. Atmosphere is pretty neat too. You can draw on tables!!"}
{"text":"I love, love, loved this place! We went there yesterday, a party of nine at 4:30 pm & tried a variety of items within our group. Oysters, frog legs, angry edamame & chicken wings to start. The oysters were plump, the frog legs were crispy and the Cajun spice on the edamame was tasty. Our party once again ran the gamut in ordering entrees, blue crab, snow crab, king crab, lobster & Dungeness crab. My Dungeness crab was nearly 3 lbs. of awesomeness in trifecta sauce & hot level heat & it was an amazing mess. You have to work hard to get to the meat, but it is an ever so rewarding treasure hunt. Our service from Alice was impeccable and the local beer selection was an added bonus. Make sure that you aren't wearing anything too nice as far as clothing, get there early as we did, there was a long wait when we left at 6:30 pm. Also, no ice cream for dessert and they don't take American Express. All in all, a wonderful visit, it was so nice to patronize a local Mom & Pop shop that is better than every large chain with unlimited resources. The food here was just THAT GOOD. Run, don't walk to the Angry Crab Shack in Mesa."}
{"text":"The price is good and the food is amazing had 3 bags of shrimp, crab and an order of chicken tenders"}
{"text":"Favorite!! I wish I knew about this place earlier. Excellent seafood place in phx area. Their spicy trifecta sauce is just mind blowing. I would recommend going for the medium heat on the sauce. We have been there twice and nothing less than ultimate satisfaction both the times. 

First time we ordered the lobster and Dungeness crab in trifecta sauce. It was served in plastic bags inside a bucket. They give you the necessary tools to clean the shellfish. As we were first timers to a Cajun/creole place, we did not know how to tear it apart.  Best part was the server patiently explained the drill to us. The meat with that trifecta sauce was so so delicious!

Second time we got the snow crab and king crab legs in trifecta sauce. I think this is more hassle free eating and more value for the money. I would highly recommend going with this option. Nothing less than delicious again. 

Another must try on their menu is their corn bread. It is so buttery and smooth helps perfectly to reduce the spice on the trifecta sauce. 
Must must go to place!"}
{"text":"Ate here about three times now. Its not the best but coming from New Orleans it stops the cravings for crawfish a little bit. Oysters are pretty good/fresh.  Cajun fries are really good. If you had real poboy and want poboys don't get it from here... Go to New Orleans. Or Mississippi."}
{"text":"Out of all the angry crabs this is my favorite. Feels spacious, clean, food is good. I had crawfish and king crab trifecta medium. Service was awesome thanks Coral."}
{"text":"the food is fine, but this is what I call the ultimate finger food place.  everything is eaten with your hands,  Perhaps this is ok but not to my liking."}
{"text":"Been here before. And I just love the options to do your crab legs, lobster, shrimp, clams, etc. it's a Must to come here and check it out, if you have not yet!!!!! You won't be disappointed!! Ask to see if you can get Noel! He's awesome!!! Thank you Noel for another great night!!!"}
{"text":"The food would be enough to write about, but they also have it going on with their service. Fun dining experience, great staff and finger licking good sacks of seafood. The veggies were also well prepared."}
{"text":"I will not be back to this location! This was my first time here and I ordered take out and because it was over $50 they took my card number in case I didn't pick up the food. I went in and paid cash but they still charged my card and now I have to wait forever just to get refunded this is bullshit and will probably will happen to other people to!"}
{"text":"Anything you order is amazing when it's cooked with the Trifecta #1. I love this place and usually the service is great but tonight my order was messed up a couple of times so that was a little frustrating....still very yummy though!"}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews, but I felt my experience at Angry Crab warrants one. My family and I went there this past Saturday night upon hearing great things. At first, I was not impressed. It was a typical Saturday night with a wait time of 30 mins for a party of 4. Well somehow the hostess over looked us, so we ended up waiting almost 45 mins (while watching other people get sat, who had gotten there after us). By the time we sat down, we were a little irritated. 

If it had not been for the GREAT service from our waitress (Nicole), I would give this place 3 stars. Our waitress was on point. She was energetic, funny, and addressed our concerns immediately. She explained the menu to the point where we understood how to order, and she gave us recommendations as well. This was great after being \"greeted\" by another server, and that server never came back. When Nicole saw us just sitting there, she immediately dropped what she was doing to come and take care of us (and believe me, she was busy!). We saw several other servers walk by without acknowledging us...it left us feeling awkward. Up until our waitress took our order, we felt overlooked.Although she was busy, she took her time to explain things and answer our questions.

We decided to start off with an order of the Gumbo, and then ordered the King Crab with the traditional boil sauce, and added all of the fixin's to the bag (Sausage, corn, and red potato). It was amazing, but the boil bag was a little short on the traditional boil sauce. Either way, it was still worth the 45 minute wait. The best part of our experience here, is that once we ordered our food we never had to ask for anything else. Our waitress brought everything out we would need ahead of time, and we never even had to ask for refills. She brought gloves, crab crackers, and bibs. The excellent service here will definitely bring us back. Not only is the food amazing, the atmosphere is fun (yes, it's very loud...especially if it's your birthday) and our server was one of the best servers we've ever had. Cheers to Angry Crab BBQ Shack!"}
{"text":"Our server Greg was amazing. It's been a while since we had good service and definitely received it here. Great food and a fun atmosphere. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"For my birthday, 7 of us went to Angry Crab.  I've been to the one on the westside and loved it so much I had to go again.  So 3 of us ordered about 5 pounds of seafood for my birthday...mind you.  The feast included shrimp, snow crab legs and lobster and it was awesome! And yes, we ate it all. You would think we would've been stuffed, however, we had to try the charred oysters too.  Oh and there was cheesecake too and the \"out of tune' birthday song from my friends.  This location does get packed quickly but they do not take reservations for groups under 15 so expect to wait.  All in all, it was a great birthday dinner."}
{"text":"We went to the Angry Crab on Sunday for a late lunch. All I can say is that I'm a fan. I've been wanting to try this place for awhile now. We were meeting a group of people but arrived late and tables were full, so we sat at the bar. We were greeted right away and when we sat at the bar the bartender was so friendly and nice to explain how the ordering went. We ordered a Dozen oysters, the Soft Shell Crab plate, and a pound of shrimp in a bag with the Trifecta Sauce level 3 heat (recommended by the bartender).

Service was excellent, the food was excellent. Having lived down South for a period of time, I loved that style of eating, just throw it on the table, roll up the sleeves and get dirty. I did take note on the sinks they had too for washing your hands. We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Love Angry Crab, and so nice having it so close. Great food, nice place for groups, and attentive staff. Go all the time and love it!"}
{"text":"Grab your time card and get ready to clock in cause you're about do work!! 

This place is messy goodness so don't be shy of the bibs.  The mess is warranted and makes the experience all the better. 

Service was exceptional and our waitress excellent at breaking  it down for us first timers. 

We ordered the hush puppies, which other reviews on here will tell are out-freaking-standing. 
Then also had the 1-lb of the King Crab which was excellent. 

I truly can't wait to return and dig in with unadulterated abandonment."}
{"text":"This was my first time here at this place. I was recommend to come here from some friends who stated this place was good. I have a 1lbs Cajun shrimp fries and a coke. I asked the server how hot was Cajun he stated it was very hot. I received my bag of shrimp and there was absolutely no flavor. The sauce was watered down, the fires extremely cold and soggy & the coke was more carbonated than the usual taste. I honestly would not come back to this location. Also the wait was 25 minutes long and there was about 8 tables open and it was just a party for 3. Bad experience for a first timer. I would rather pay what I paid ($20) at red lobster. Never would I recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Holy cow. This place is DELICIOUS! Found you on Yelp, just left and HAD to leave a review. Got the Shrimp boil with Tribeca, potatoes, sausage and corn. I could drink the sauce. Amazing. We also got the Calamari, Oysters and a Shrimp Po Boy. Everything was superb. 

Our waitress was Michelle. She could not have been more helpful! Definitely a top notch waitress! Thank you again if you are reading this! 

Love, Rory and Monica who celebrated their 17th anniversary with you! XOXOXO"}
{"text":"Ordered the Trifecta shrimp,clams,corn, and potatoe!  The food is simply amazing, reminded me of a place near my home in LA called \"boiling crab\", I now found a new place to get my seafood cravings satisfied!  Brandon served me tonight and was spot on with service, came back and checked up to make sure I was doing ok and topped my drink off three times.  I say the sauce is addicting but beware of the spicy level you choose.  I chose spicy level 1 and it was enough for me.

This is definitely my new place to eat when I come to AZ!"}
{"text":"Let me start this review off by saying I don't enjoy seafood.  It is not filling and a pain to eat.  That being said, I sat next to one of the owners on a flight back to Phoenix and he peeked my interest.  

I ended up checking this place out with my buddy and I was expecting to try the BBQ.  I sat down, started looking at the menu and couldn't find any BBQ.  Apparently this is one of the locations that does not offer BBQ.  Ouch.  Now I'm sitting in a seafood restaurant faced to try my fear.  I ordered the snow crab.  It came in the bag that we have all seen here on yelp and a crab cracker.  I have never eaten this before and had no idea what I was doing.  I dove in and was trying to eat the crab.  It was a ton of work for food I don't even enjoy.  I added the corn on the cob to my bag and for me that was easily the best part.  

My bill ended up being $26 for myself alone, and then I left hungry and ended up hitting up the McDonalds drive thru on the way home.  

I suppose my largest disappointment was the no BBQ.  I spent a lot for a meal I didn't like and having to do a lot of work to eat that meal.  

I'm kinda turned off now, but if I were to come back to Angry Crab Shack it would only be to check out the BBQ so it would obviously have to be another location. 

Return factor 15%"}
{"text":"Hands down some of the worst crawfish I've ever had on top of that I asked for them to be hot and they had no heat to it at all and the flavor was bland also they were over cooked but their po boy was good and their fries"}
{"text":"This is about our 10th time here, maybe more including to go orders, we love it!  They are often out of crawfish, which is our only complaint. But the blue crab was so good today that I forgot about the crawfish. A+

Evan was our server today A+ as well."}
{"text":"I am from the Bay Area, California where The Boiling Crab reigns supreme and I've always craved it ever since moving to Arizona. But let me tell you, Angry Crab is comparable! I love their fried oysters and trifecta shrimp so much! Their prices are also reasonable considering they're in the desert and fresh seafood isn't always available. I love this place! Service is always good! The fries are also yummy! I'm eating leftover shrimp as I type this!"}
{"text":"There will be a wait - 20-30 minutes, they'll text you when your table's ready.  It will be loud (bar-like atmosphere), if that matters to you.  Things will get messy.  But yes, it's so worth it.  I tried to snap a couple pictures but when everyone's too busy wolfing down the food and your hands, maybe forearms, are covered in trifecta sauce, things get a little difficult.

For the three of us, we got: 2lbs of shrimp, 1lb of mussels, 1lb of clams, 1lb of blue crab, and vegetables, all in trifecta sauce at a hot (level 3).  I loved the sauce - it definitely had a good kick to it but I might give level 5 a shot next time cause I mean who doesn't love a little challenge?  The veggies were okay, but next time I'll probably give it a skip and stick to the corn and potatoes instead.  Similarly for the mussels and clams, I mean there was a lot of shell.  I know, I didn't think this through, but probably half the bag was shell and I would've much rathered more meat.  Shrimp was a solid first choice for me, with crab coming in at a close second.  If you couldn't tell, I've got my next visit all planned out.

The boyfriend's mom doesn't care for seafood in general so she ordered 1/2lb of pulled pork.  We had a bite of some of her leftovers after devouring the seafood and it was pretty decent but I'm still a huge fan of seafood so...

To top it off, the boyfriend's dad was still raving about this place a week later, so I think we have a winner here."}
{"text":"Dozen oysters, lobster, shrimp, crawfish, mussels and more for $100 to feed 5 people I'd say that's a good deal. Considering how good the food is and how many people we came with I thought it'd be more. 

Great food & atmosphere I recommend this place to anyone who loves seafood and doesn't mind getting a bit dirty (:"}
{"text":"This is not really a review...just something after reading the menu that I had a question about. 
I love when restaurants give discounts to our military and veterans...
But, if you are going to include fire fighters,  polic
e officers,  and even teachers...Why are you leaving out nurses?? 
We work Long hours, weekends, holidays and sacrifice time with our families to take care of your families. 
Not mad..just wondering your reason for leaving nurses out."}
{"text":"Our party of 4 called ahead on a rainy Friday evening at 730; were told there's still a 30 to 40 minute wait so we came a little later about 8 and got a table immediately.  fun server took our drink order and we ordered delish hush puppies and yummy fried alligator for appies. Dion explained  the menu and told us how the place smokes their own brisket and ribs with delicious sauces on the side so hubby ordered the brisket but I ordered a very good shrimp basket with special sauce. Everything had good flavor and our choice of  Cajun spicy was yummy. The peel and eat 1 pound shrimp came in a bag with excellent flavors. also took a bite of the soft shell crab po boy... very good! Three cocktails,2 appies, 4 dinners with tip totaled $100 not too bad. will be back!"}
{"text":"Angry Crab & BBQ used to be one of my favorite seafood places in town. However, the last two experiences over a time period of nearly two years have not been good. 

In April of 2017, we went to the restaurant and one person's meal (salmon over rice) came 15-20 minutes after the other (shrimp bag) 

After that experience, we tried the restaurant again recently and faced the same issue. In addition, this time the rice and corn on the salmon meal was ice cold along with the shrimp in the bag being way over cooked. 

The redeeming quality, the salmon was fantastic when it came. 

Not sure the next time we will give it a chance, but I hope by then it returns to former glory."}
{"text":"This will be my second review of this restaurant and they get five stars, AGAIN.  Consistent level of great service!  Immediate greet both at the door and at my table.  My server (WILL) was very knowledgeable and offered great suggestions.  I had the snow crab with the trifecta seasoning and I added potatoes, corn and sausage.  It was a beautiful mess and I  can't wait to come back.  I also decided to give the ribs a second chance so I ordered some to go for my husband.  They look much more appetizing than my last visit. Keep it up, Angry Crab!  One of my new favorites!!"}
{"text":"This will be the second AC location I have had the pleasure of visiting.  We went on a Monday and it was packed for their \"Mixed Bag\" Monday special, which we didn't really know about, but were out of at dinner time.  Our server was great.  Very helpful to my friends and my husband who had never been to Angry Crab.  I don't remember his name, but when my friend's blue crab took almost a half hour longer than the rest of the table's food, our server expressed genuine concern and strived to make our experience  positive for the rest of the meal.  Management never visited the table, but he said management took care of it.  My two pounds of snow crab legs were perfectly cooked and delicious.  My husband's shrimp were way over cooked but he was okay with it.  

Service:  5 STARS.  Food:  3 STARS.

  I will consider visiting this location again someday and give their kitchen another chance because I have had such consistently great meals at the Indian School Road location.  Until then, I prefer the atmosphere and food in their  (larger) Arcadia location that also has barbeque!"}
{"text":"What a fun atmosphere! The food was decent and I loved signing the wall! This is a great place for a happy hour!"}
{"text":"Shrimps with trifecta sauce is the best! 
The King crab leg with garlic sauce is worth to try."}
{"text":"Food was great!! Everything tastes good. Our server forgot to bring our cole slaw and was very slow in following up with us. I would go back though."}
{"text":"Love the food!  Glad we got a great seafood place finally in Goodyear!! Great family environment and great staff. Food is always hot and fresh and there's usually not a long wait for a table on a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"Listen, my coworker and I just left there. It was my first time eating at Angry Crab Shack. I passed by it over the weekend and thought I'd try it today.  This. Place. Is. Good! Food was nice and hot, AND seasoned. We both got level 3 which I think is supposed to be medium but still cleared our sinuses.  Got the snow crabs which were pretty meaty. Also got a lb of shrimp w/sausage added. Let's talk about the shrimp...Shoutout to the shrimp that gave up their lives to feed me. I surely do thank you! Now I was thinking that a lb of shrimp was gonna be like small shrimps...no, these are full grown man shrimps! Those shrimps lived very full lives if we're going by size. Eyes attached & all which I was surprised about. Customer service was great and the wait to get our food wasn't long. Wasn't crowded either, but probably because we went @3:30 on a Monday. I'd definitely go back"}
{"text":"Unbelievable New Orleans flavors make my taste buds dance and the gumbo is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"9/21/15

I had some reservation about trying out this place due to some of the polar opposite reviews.  I did take in the advice about wearing casual attire, and I am glad that I did.  We went on a Sunday around 11:30am, to attempt to meet out the possible Sunday after church crowd, and any football fans.  There were a few tables already seating, and eating their meals.  The décor was definitely homely and gave that backyard eatery feel.  Our server was cordial, and sat down at the next table to assist us with comprehending the menu.  He gave us amble amount of time to make our decision, and assisted with some suggestions in regards to the top 4 pots of meat to get.  He also told us that if we ever came on a Friday to shy away from the crab meat because they only had a certain amount of crab tools, and not everyone will get one if they are in use, especially if the night has 1-2 hour wait for a table.  We ordered the shrimp basket for my son (there was no kid meal on the menu but he was given one), one pot of shrimp (1 lb) with 4 potatoes and 1 corn on the cob, and 1 lb of king crab legs.  We decided to get the trifecta sauce at mild. We went with the mild temperature from another suggestion of our server, whom said the medium (3) is more a hot.  I thoroughly enjoy a good heat, but I didn't want it to overpower the food.  Also, my significant other is not able to tolerate heat as well as I can.  I am glad we took our servers advice because my significant other was having some heat issues, and I can honestly say that it cleared by sinus by the end of the meal.  It didn't take them long to bring us our food, and when they gave us the crab meat, I think one of the legs broke the bag because the sauce started oozing out of the bag, coming towards me.  At first, it appeared to be grease but it was the butter mixed with the medium sauce.  The shrimp were still intact, and very juicy.  Everything was cooked to perfection, and it was fun to eat with our hands.  Definitely wear the bib and have a ton of napkins at your disposal.  There is a sink in the dining area, with soap, to wash your hands off.  Our meal, before tip, came out to be $58.  Definitely worth the money, and will be returning again."}
{"text":"Valerie was awesome and the food was Fantastic to boot. Great place to find that inner caveman!! Great atmosphere for any occasion."}
{"text":"Its awesome experience, great food. Bartenders are really cool. I live the environment. They have fresh sea food and that's rare to find here in AZ"}
{"text":"This place is decent. The food was messy but good. The service was not that organized and they seemed to not care at times. They said they'd send us a text message or something when it was our turn, but it didn't happen. But we did get seated eventually. Overall, the service was good, but not great. Maybe because it was too full. Overall, this place is decent with good enough service. I would recommend it at least one time in your life."}
{"text":"The crab and shrimp at this location were fabulous! The fries are delicious too. The best thing though about our visit to angry crab shack was the customer service we got with our waitress. Her name was Cori and the service that we got was amazing. She always made sure we had everything we needed and we felt like she really cared about us. We will definitely be back and will ask to sit in her section."}
{"text":"Love the food and atmosphere

I highly recommend this place for a casua, fun evening out with family and friends."}
{"text":"Just opened so will cut them some slack.  Bbq was good, but they didn't have a few of the seafood offering.  Also, had at least 30 instances when someone would come by and ask if everything was good.  I know when you open a new restaurant you schedule heavy, but don't have them ask me every time of everything is good/ok.  We will be back and I'm sure it will get better."}
{"text":"Hmmmm. So, if you've eaten at boiling crab in LA, you'd know why I can't give this place a solid 5stars. 

BUT. It is well worth 4 stars. 

Service was good. But I found the seasoning a wee bit (a tiny bit) lacking. We got shrimp and mussels which was very good. Kiddo got fried shrimp which was deliciously crispy and well battered.

Was very much looking forward to the oysters but they hadn't received their shipment well past 3pm that day :(

I like that they have a trough style washing station for hand washing after the messy but delicious meal"}
{"text":"Soft shell crab basket was delicious and the broiled clams were good.  However it was loud and our waitress kept putting ice into our drinks even though we kept asking for no ice.  Also she didn't check in on us for a long time. It was hard to flag her down."}
{"text":"Food is terrific ... but the service at the bar sucks - the dude has no people skills and is slooooowwww. Takes forever to get a drink. He makes no eye contact. My wife and I sat at the bar waiting for a table and he kept helping people behind us?!... hello!, we're sitting in front of you first and he helps the people behind us. I get it if you're busy but this is a very small bar...8 feet long.. pay attention dude."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! The food was incredible and server was so nice and helpful with any questions we had about the menu. It was my boyfriend's birthday and they did not disappoint! The bloody Mary had a little twist to it and I loved it. I'd rather eat here than at Joe's. Thanks for a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"So super pleased with my visit to Angry Crab & BBQ on Indian School! I recommend being served by Brandon- who works well with Families and Couples! He gave us great recommendations and was pleasant with a restaurant full of patrons. I really loved adding the vegetable bag. I ordered 2 bags with the Trifecta seasoning 1 Shrimp and 1 Snow Crab. We also, ordered a kids basket that's not on the menu but is available. The Cajun Fries are so yummy! Great Draft Beer selection! I don't drink but Grandma ordered a Blue Moon w/ Orange Slice She was content. Management came by to check on service and food and we shared the goodness that Brandon brought to us. Can't wait to be back with family!! Brandon thank you for holding up the Angry Crab promise You are doing a great job and the food you serve is awesome!!  Kudos Brandon and Angry Crab Management team"}
{"text":"Our previous experiences with Angry Crab Shack were both awesome and disappointing so this third review seems like a good way to sum up the total of our experiences. Our third visit was great. One of the best qualities about this restaurant is the experience. Where else do you get to get messy and play with your food? The seafood is fresh, it comes in live and not frozen (frozen items are indicated as such on the menu). The quality and taste is wonderful. And I love that the veggie bag boil comes with a nice selection of seasonal veg. It isn't just your general \"broccoli and carrots\" but also includes things like jimica and collards. The hush puppies are hands down the best I've ever had.

As far as service goes, we've only had a bad experience with one server (see previous review). Otherwise, the staff has always been friendly and welcoming. Our order has never been wrong and everything comes out in a timely manner. Overall, this is a laid back environment where you can actually enjoy some fresh seafood in the desert and eat like a barbarian, hands dripping with sauce to the elbows! Sounds like a good time to me. Of course, you can always eat in a more civilized fashion too but where is the fun in that."}

{"text":"Excellent as usual! Love this place, always fresh and delicious boil style and fried stuff too! We got a little bit of everything, soft shell crab, clams, crawfish, shrimp, blue crab , and my girlfriend got the BBQ so they do have a lot of non seafood options too. Thanks for another excellent meal."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic! The staff was very friendly and attentive. I would not go back for the food. Cajun fries were good but the turkey club and soft shell crab were subpar."}
{"text":"Just moved to Phoenix from Iowa, and this was the first place I took my dad after he helped me move. It was a little late in the afternoon (2:30ish) and we had dinner plans so we ate light. Shared gumbo and a lb of shrimp with sausage and potatoes in the trifecta sauce. 2 words... Simply ahhhhmaaaaaaazzzziiinnngggg! Will definitely be back soon. Service was great, and loved the hand washing sink(definitely a necessity)!"}
{"text":"A great experience with Jeff and Shannon at the bar today. Extremely friendly and attentive service.  Great food as always. Angry Crab never disappoints."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going here for years, pretty much since they first opened this location in Mesa. The service is always quick and good. The food is always fresh and tastes great! Simply put, best seafood in town."}
{"text":"This Angry Crab Shack also serves BBQ.  This visit I decided to give it a try.  I ordered a pound of pulled pork.  The pork was served with a small cup of maybe 1-1/2 oz of BBQ sauce.  When I ran out I was asked to pay an extra $1.25 for another ounce of BBQ sauce.  I ended up taking my meal home where I had extra BBQ sauce left over from a recent 'Can't Stop Smoking' order in my fridge.  

In the past I have enjoyed the sea food here; but have never been asked to pay more for condiments.  If this is their new policy they can keep their precious condiments.

There are too many good BBQ joints in the neighborhood that are generous with their BBQ sauce for customers to enjoy.  We won't need to trouble Angry Crab for BBQ again."}
{"text":"Angry crab is fun.  I like the catfish basket.  Today I tried the calamari and found it came with a little kick.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Our server, Hung, was awesome! Good service, fun atmosphere, delicious seafood in the desert!  Great draft beers and the Clam Digger was the best bloody mary we ever had.  Frog legs and Dungeness crab were perfect.  Ordered the clams a little too hot (trifecta with Scorpion level 5), we'll definitely take it down a notch our next time back! Can't wait!"}
{"text":"This place is a really exciting restaurant to go eat. Very lively and the food is good considering there's no ocean around here. The staff is always superb!"}
{"text":"Angry crab is a local establishment that my wife son and I frequent often. The food here is always excellent the flavors of their trifecta are a must try I suggest the snow crab legs. I haven't written on yelp for this restaurant yet but I have to today as the level of service I received was nothing less than exemplary.  My server Larry was on top of it helping table after table even if they were not his tables.  he was assisting everyone and never dropped the ball."}
{"text":"I will say it right up front, I'm not a seafood type of person, and if it weren't for shrimp, I could honestly say that I almost never eat seafood at all. That said, a group of friends and I went to this place today with the intent of trying something new and different, and I was very pleasantly surprised. 

We actually had no wait, probably because it was a lunch and not a dinner, and it was a late lunch, so I'm assuming the herd must have thinned itself out by then. We ordered quite a few items since the cost was being spread around and (I for one) wanted to get the whole experience. We went with king crab and shrimp by the pound, the highly recommended trifecta of seasonings and mild spice, along with the calamari and hush puppy appetizers. 

Man oh man, those hush puppies and the calamari were outstanding. Hush puppies had just a tiny amount of bite to them, but way better than the standard \"bread ball\" fare you get elsewhere, these actually tasted like something. Not too greasy either, another plus, at least in my book. Decent amount of them were served as well, consider the cheap cost. Same with the calamari, you definitely get a decent portion, in our case enough to satisfy three hungry adults until we dug into the main course. 

Shrimp I've had before, but never this full-on, still-has-whiskers and eyes shrimp. Definitely an experience extracting the good bits from that, but so worth it. Absolutely delicious, and we devoured an entire pound of them. The sauce was great and we ended up getting some spoons to scoop some more of it out of the bags, it was that good. 

The king crab was an entirely new thing for me. I can't even remember the last time I've had crab, and even then I doubt it was king crab. Suffice to say, it is totally worth the hassle to get the meat out of those things. Absolutely delicious and perfectly cooked, at least to my admittedly novice pallet. 

On the whole, I would say the food was spot on and exceeded my expectations. For someone not at all into the seafood scene to be enamored enough to go back again, that should give you some idea how good it was. 

Service was outstanding, super attentive and exceptionally friendly. Definitely something you don't see too often, unfortunately, so it was a welcome change of pace. The atmosphere and decor were pretty much what you'd expect, with walls you could write on, lots of TVs showing sports, corrugated metal and the whole Southern California / beach-bum ambiance going on, which only added to the experience. It wasn't pretentious at all, nor was it over done to the point of jumping the interior decor shark. Places with a theme tend to carry it too far, I've found, but this one hit the mark just right.

On the whole, I would not hesitate to go back, and highly recommend this place. Looking forward to my next visit, especially to snack on those hush puppies again!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Had the bucket of snow crab in Cajun sauce with a spice level of 3 and it was perfect. Very tasty with just enough heat. Added a few potatoes and ate it all. Was so good I came back the next day and had the snow crab in the pacific rim sauce 3 on the heat. Was good. Sauce was very tasty but didn't stick to the crab like the Cajun had to rub crab in the sauce. Didn't figure out until I was half way done. It's a coconut curry sauce and really good once I figured out to run the crab in it. Spice is subjective the guy I was with for a 1 and was dying so be warned"}
{"text":"My first but definitely not my last visit.....

This place stays packed and always draws a crowd. They seat you quickly and the staff promptly takes your order. 

The menu is an excitement of sauces and rubs to custom create your wings. On this visit I had the cod basket and it was absolutely delicious. I ordered some Texas Toast to make it into a sandwich. Did I say it was DELICIOUS?!! I don't think I left anything in that basket. LoL

It also has bar seating, outdoor seating, and several TV's that are perfect for sports gatherings. 

I'm a fan and I'm sure you will be too after your first visit!"}
{"text":"Remember it's a crab shack not a high end restaurant. Take it as it is and enjoy the fun atmosphere. Great food good times!"}
{"text":"Amazing food JK was our server and he was a blast! He explained the menu and even hooked me up with a new bib when mine fell on the floor. We got snow crab, trifecta sauce, medium, with potatoes, gumbo, and corn bread. Everything was delicious!!! Good prices and fun environment if you aren't afraid to get a little dirty."}
{"text":"If you have never experienced the Angry Crab, then you should, at least once! It is quite the experience. 

When ordering, there are a few decisions to make if you choose from the seafood market: 1. The type (I chose the Dungeness crab), 2. The sauce (I went for the trifecta--which is Kajun, lemon pepper and garlic), 3. The spicy level (wimpy, level 1 out of 5, which was just right), 4. Decide whether you are adding anything to your bag like corn (I did and am glad I did as the corn in the sauce was delicious), although whatever you add will cost additional money. I had a taste of the sausage from one of my dinner mates, and next time, I'd also add sausage and red potatoes.

The cost of the seafood is all by the pound, and I was told that the Dungeness were 2 or 3 pounders, so I asked for a 2 pounder, which would be retrieved from the tank (I never did see the tank but meant to on the way out). After a few minutes, our waiter was back to tell me that although there had been five crab in the tank, someone else had just ordered all five! I really had my heart on Dungeness crab as it is actually in season right now, although if they are live in a tank, then they are always in season! After some time previewing the menu again, I chose the snow crab.

Everyone's bags were delivered to the table except mine, and after several minutes, I told everyone to start to eat, which resulted in my sampling several bags until mine arrived. The spice level ramps up quickly, so be careful. I'm not a total wimp when it comes to spice but am glad that I chose the wimpy here! When I did receive my bag, the snow crab was good, but more veggies in that yummy sauce would be better.

The fun part of this experience is eating with your hands, wearing the BIB (really, you have to wear it), and washing up in the trough sink. 

Leave your jewels in the safe, wear clothes that can be easily washed, and come for the experience."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It's a perfect place to take friends.  Eating out of a bag seems odd at first but it's super fun!"}
{"text":"I happened on this restaurant today when I was apartment hunting.  I had had the same type of meal at LA Crawfish in Tomball, TX.   The Angry Crab, however, had a larger selection of fish and seafood as well as sauces and intensity of heat.   I had the shrimp with a potato and small ear of corn.  I got the Trifecta Sauce and the medium heat.  It was SO good!   The medium heat was pretty spicy, but once I got used to it, I loved it.

If you are looking for your typical Louisiana crawfish or shrimp boil, this is not the place.  Their shellfish comes in a plastic bag with the sauce you pick.  You don't need to dip it in a remoulade sauce or cocktail sauce.  It comes \"swimming\" in the sauce you select.

They have raw oysters, poor boys, gumbo and more.  The atmosphere is very relaxed.  You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"This  restaurant is great and lots of fun!   Food and service was terrific.  We had the shrimp and king crab.  Be careful with seasoning - I like things spicy and a 1 was plenty hot enough.  We also ordered the hush puppies and side of vegetables.  
Everything was fresh and cooked to perfection.  We will return soon however week nights are less crowded than weekends."}
{"text":"Oh, Angry Crab Shack - you did not disappoint! When a complete stranger at another restaurant preaches to me how great this place is, I had to bookmark it right way. What was even better, is when a co-worker surprised me by driving us here for lunch. 

All I knew about this place was how popular it was among my friends (and strangers). After experiencing it firsthand, I see why!

We were seated right away and our server asked us if we had been here before. Friend: Yes, Me: No. So we immediately got the lowdown on how everything works. With our drink order in, we scanned the menu looking for something that sounded good. 

In the end, we each decided to each order a pound of shrimp and then share a pound of king crab. I added a potato and sausage to my shrimp. 

For seasoning, I went with the trifecta that everyone else raves about. For the heat, I went with 2-medium to play it safe the first time, with 3-hot on the side for dipping. 

If you think you don't need the plastic bib, think again. This experience will not be a clean one. There are no utensils other that crab crackers. We received three plastic bags filled with seafood heaven. Your hands will be covered in seasoning/oil (muck). Put the iPhone away and just enjoy your meal!

The shrimp was really good. The crab and sausage were amazing!! They soaked up the seasoning and tasted better to me than the shrimp did - but in the end, the whole meal was excellent. What I discovered was that the 3-hot seasoning was right up my alley. It's hot, but the flavor was really nice. Next time I will just go with this heat level. 

The service here was outstanding. Our server came over continually to refill our drinks and made sure everything was okay. 

3/4 of the way into our meal and I was starting to get full. This was a lot of food - but I kept on going because it was so good. Ok, maybe I don't have any self-control.

I love this place. I like the atmosphere, the music and the food. Everyone should try this place one time to experience it. 

Thankfully, there is a sink towards the back of the restaurant where you can wash all the muck off your hands when you are done. Do not attempt to use your phone until you do this.

22 craft beers and 5 wines to choose from. Wings, calamari, oysters and po' boys. It doesn't get any better than this. 

If you are a seafood fan or you like some Cajun food now and then, you need to give this place a try. 

My work schedule is pretty crazy, but I am already trying to schedule when I can come back here again with the whole family to indoctrinate them!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try a new local restaurant to celebrate my Mom's 70th bday so we ended up at The Angry Crab. What a great night! The food was delicious, atmosphere was just right and service was excellent (thanks Shannon). We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tim our server is AWESOME and the food was outstanding. Me and my husband are celebrating our Anniversary and I couldn't have asked for a better night. Thank you Angry Crab!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fanatic when it comes to spicy seafood in a bag! I've tried many different names/restaurants and came across Angry Crab during my visit in Phoenix this past weekend and would like to share my reviews.

*****Environment: The place is definitely pretty spacious. Definitely one of the biggest I've see n compared to other competitors. I do like the big projector TV displayed by the bar, giving this place a great place for game nights and also the wooded walls where they allow you to write and doodle. I didn't feel crowded here at all. The place looked clean and smelled good for being a place that serves this type of food. The bathroom was clean and so were the heavy duty hand washing stations.

***Food: The food was alright, it wasn't the best flavored I've had but it definitely was up there as far as spice levels. You have an option to choose from 1-5, 1 being the lease and 5 being deadly. Let's just say I got a 4 and my nose was running while I was eating. I ordered the Snow Crab, Crawfish and Shrimp. The flavor was a little on the weak side. For picking the Trifecta flavor I felt it was lacking the garlic flavor and the sauce was very minimal to where the seafood couldn't take in the flavor as much. I was a little disappointed in the sauce. Also the Oysters I ordered weren't as rich in flavor, not sure if it was a bad batch. The crawfish, I could tell were previously frozen as they were dark and the shells were tender. Other places I know charge cheaper for frozen vs fresh crawfish. But the shrimp and snow crab I feel was a good size, quality over the rest. If I was to come back I'd probably just order the shrimp or snow crab. 

*Service: The server was a little interesting. It took a little longer than expected to receive my beer and also I wasn't sure if he was try to crack jokes to be funny? The reason I said that was because he offered bibs to everyone at the table. However when he offered one to my brother, he said he didn't have enough to cover him since he was a bigger guy. I found that definitely offensive, especially to crack fat jokes when we haven't established any type of friendship connections. I feel one would need to be at a certain friendship level before cracking fat jokes. My brother was ok with it, however I was. I felt it was rude and unacceptable. 

Overall, I will give this place a 3 star. Would I return, most likely not, for the price I could receive much better service and food elsewhere."}
{"text":"My husband and I drove by Angry Crab last week and decided to try it out today. I should mention this was his pick. After searching the menu and Yelp reviews I found something I could eat. I'm vegetarian although I eat fish and I'm gluten intolerant. We went at lunch time and the place wasn't crowded. I ordered the grilled mahi mahi with white rice. I declined the sides that came with (potato salad, cole slaw or baked beans). My husband ordered the fried catfish with seasoned fries and cole slaw. He enjoyed the fish, he said it was seasoned well. While waiting for my meal to arrive our server Greg informs me that the rice cooker is broken and I can select another side dish. Not long after my husband's meal arrives and I'm assured by Greg that mine is right behind his. More time goes by and Greg tells me that someone burned my mahi mahi, but another piece is being prepared. For the inconvenience my portion of the meal was comped. Greg also threw in complimentary corn bread. 

The atomsphere while fun for some was a bit much for me. Aside from the grilled mahi mahi and salmon there isn't much on the menu for a health conscious eater such as myself. That being said, I will not return. I would like to give a shoot out to Greg!!"}
{"text":"This has been one of my favorite places to eat for quite a while now. The location on Alma is the best, I will usually drive the extra mile because of the service and quality. Today was no exception, the flavor and quality of the food was on point, and our waiter Erik was charming and amusing. If you don't like getting messy, this may not be up your alley, but I love it! Yumm!"}
{"text":"The very best in Seafood. Been here a few times now & got take out dinner from here today as well. Great place, awesome servers so friendly & fun loving. Live this place. Will be back many times from now on. I found a great restaurant."}
{"text":"They are the best. Went here a few weeks ago for the first time. It was amazing. The wait for a table is at least 30-40 mins. So you can imagine how good it is. Service is lovely. The staff are super friendly & make you feel so much at home. Love the atmosphere. Prices are reasonable. Food tastes sooooooo good. Be careful what heat level you order. Lol. It is spicy. Go ready to feel at home & get your hands dirty. Will be back there soon. Love this place."}
{"text":"I came to this location during my lunch hour and there were about 7 groups of people eating so it seemed pretty slow. When we first walked it there was no one there at the hostess table to greet us and we had to wait about 5 minutes before someone showed up to seat us. The waitress/I don't know what her other job could be, took our drink order and 5 minutes later another guy comes to the table and asks us if someone took our drink order. I said yes someone took our order and he tells us that he thinks she got tied up with something and asks us again what we ordered. At this point I was getting pretty upset. I could tell the service was not going to be that great. We continued to look at the menu and I ordered gumbo for starters. The gumbo is served in a plastic bowl as if it were purchased at the store and tasted like it was reheated in the microwave. It had tons of rice and was very skimpy on the meat side. It was okay but I've had way better gumbo. 

We order the shrimp trifecta ( headless) and the crab trifecta. It didn't take too long for the food to arrive and both were really good. The food is served in a bag and can get pretty messy so make sure you wear your bib. The trifecta has lots of flavor and really gives the seafood a great taste. I'll come back to try other things on the menu but the overall service is crap! I hope the managers read these reviews and get this fixed."}
{"text":"I DON'T like Boiling Crab, Kickin' Crab, or Hot 'N Juicy.. So why did i try this place out? It was a friends birthday, ordered crab legs, mussels, clams, and shrimp and the flavor was good, like really good.. if someone says they didn't like the taste, just ask them which flavor they tried, there are more than several.  (personally i like kajun and trifecta SPICY) Costs a bit much though, but you already know that going in.

and get corn and the cajun fries, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Two thumbs up. I was in Louisiana for a few years and this place comes in first place. Noel the bartender can make great suggestions and takes care of his customers, even thought the place was packed, he had great service. You won't be disappointed by eating here."}
{"text":"OK so I live very close to this location,so I was very eager to try them.finally made it in last night around 6:15,wasn't to busy,asked for a booth and they weren't sure they could seat us at one even though there were 5 available. We did get a booth, apparently the bartender was supposed to take care of us. He never came over,the other waiter in another section asked him if he had us,he said no,and took his time getting to us.there was only one woman at the bar so unsure what happened there.when we ordered we were told that they didn't have at least 4 of the seafood items on the menu.you are a seafood restaurant, that's unacceptable. So we ordered the pulled pork sand which.pork was good,the bread it was served on...dry.the people seated behind us were told that one kind of seafood was 1/2 off because the tank wasn't working....not good,getting sick off bad seafood isn't worth 1/2 off let alone free.we won't be back."}
{"text":"excellent crab and fresh oysters and alligator bites."}
{"text":"Amazing tasting. So worth the money!! The waitress was very sweet and informative. Family-friendly environment. A lot to offer on the menu. I definitely recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"Angry Crab has the typical look and feel of a crab shack... casual, loud, messy, fun, friendly and you can write on the walls! It can get pretty pricey, but you get what you pay for, esp with seafood...

My go to order is a pound of shrimp with Cajun seasoning, corn bread, and bbq beans. Intense feelings of joy. I've also had the fries, fried catfish, and alligator which are super tasty too.

I'd recommend this place if you're looking for something different but still delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is just awesome. Dont believe whats your reading then go check it out for yourself. Great environment, fanatic service, and tasty crustaceans. This is a must if you in the area and ask for Travis."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch last Saturday, food was ok. Everything seemed identical to boiling crab in california but it kinda lacked in flavor compared to boiling crab. Service was 5 stars. Every one there was super nice and service was great! We ordered everything from shrimp to muscles crab and chicken strips, and it was good."}
{"text":"Love the other angry crab, but the mesa location is bad. Service isn't good, atmosphere is not like the other locations and the good doesn't taste the same. Avoid this location."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time with co workers.. plans to return next time I'm in town.. Got a bag of prawns and corn was very nice.."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience with a \"to go\" order, but decided to give it another try and glad I did. The in house experience is so much better. Our waitress Kina was amazing and really made us feel at home. We were laughing the whole way through. Being extremely indecisive, she ended up picking our meals for us and did an AMAZING job at it. 

Food was good but the atmosphere was amazing and Derek, one of the Managers, really took great care of us. Well be back! :)"}
{"text":"Went there on a wim with the family and you walk in and it looks clean and  like it would be a ton of fun.  It was both, the food I thought was really good.  Seafood here in the valley is truly a hit or miss, unless your willing to spend $30 a plate.  I loved the fact that you ate right off the table cloth it felt like I was in Louisiana even though I have never been!  :)

Its god for the kids, good for beer and they look like they can mix ups some pretty good cocktails as well.

We had the King Crab legs and they were delicious.  We were going to get the shrimp, but you can get shrimp pretty much anywhere so we splurged.  Wasn't nuts about the oysters but that's probably because we had the best oysters known to man just outside of San Fran so we are a little spoiled.  

Overall great place to go and kick back and have some good food!"}
{"text":"The server was amazing the food just was not seasoned well. It would be better if they cooked the food in the seasoning."}
{"text":"Myself and my girlfriend along with my fellow referee and his wife visited the restaurant this Past Sunday and found the food, service, and drinks to be fantastic.  I love the Gumbo that I had and their shrimp in the bag was cooked to perfection.  The environment was clean and inviting so I would recommend this place to anybody that asks me if I know a good place to eat."}
{"text":"Start off by saying this place is well worth it. Ordered some shrimp and the 5.2 lbs lobster. It comes with a handy rock and scissors. If you want a good hashtag this one deserves #nomnomnom. Will be back again soon."}
{"text":"This is not a date place I repeat this is not a date place my wife and I went here to try a new seafood place. Nice place, but then it started. They put a large piece of paper on our table. and a bucket well were used to the bucket from Joe's crab shack no prob. Then our meal came in plastic bag's ? no plates flop it on the paper table top. the crab legs were cooked in the butter not served on the side. So we ate our dinner cause we ordered it.. This is the first time I ever left a restaurant wanting nothing more than to go straight home and take a shower, I felt I was basted in butter. My wife had the king crab and she got sick, I had the snow crab it was ok but messy. I felt like I was camping out. but really the food was lousy. Now the only good part was our waitress she was good and funny. But so far in my life this has to be the worst place I have ever eaten in my life it make Mc Donalds look like a 5 star Resturant Save your money and go to Joe's or Red lobster"}
{"text":"This was our first time here... and it was amazing!!!!
Bag of king crab legs and a bag of shrimp. Don't forget to add a corn and some sausage too!! We got the trifecta sauce with a medium kick!!! It was sooo yummy!!! I would definitely stick with the king crab over snow crab... way more meat!!! Also, start off with gumbo which was perfectly seasoned and tasted amazing!!! Kids plates were a very generous size as well. All in all we will definitely go back. Price tag for all for dinners... $75. Not bad for all the food we ate. We will be back!!!"}

The drinks were not good we had 1 lemon drop & 1 old fashioned. I'll pass next time on those not worth the $. 
The King Crab legs were the best!! We had the trifecta sauce medium heat & that was a little spicy but good! The waitress Diana was very nice & helpful!!"}
{"text":"We had a nice time at the Angry Crab. 
It is a fun concept and not like anything else you see around these days. 

I thought I ordered the crayfish po'boy, but it came cold, so I think she miss heard me and brought me a different sandwich. Don't get the cold one, it was seriously lacking in flavor, but from the looks of the hot one I think it would have been much better. 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Spicy start to the new year at the Angry Crab Shack with our family of six. Needed bibs all around! 

Lobster? Check. King crab? Check. Mussels? Check. Frogs legs? Check. Dungeness crab? Check. Throw in beer, Mexican Coke and some Fanta and you have quite a party.

And we have rocks, paper and scissors. Really. We had to crack legs, claws and shells. We cut 'em. We cracked 'em. We are doing it all! To get at the meat!

I had a bag of mussels with traditional boil, some potatoes and corn on the cob, medium spice. Hot as hell and I like spicy! The mussels were great.

My wife had lobster. One and a half pound lobster we named Claws all gone. Though when she ripped open the body I didn't really need to see all the internal organs....

My oldest had a full 2.2 pounds of dungenes crab at some super spicy level. He said my mussels were spicier. He liked it. The waiter told him how to open up the shell. Interesting video we now will have forever. 

He also had a frogs legs appetizer to start. It was his first and last time because \"the thighs are slimy.\" He did like the breading.

Next oldest had alligator. He liked it, as did all who tried it including our 6 year old. It's how the old saying goes \"it tastes like chicken.\"

Number three had king crab and destroyed it! The ten year old ate her weight in crab! She said it was awesome!

Number four had salmon = boring. He does get one point and $5 for trying alligator.

It was a great messy time and you should try it!"}

{"text":"This is easily the BEST CRAB PLACE IN AZ! The cajan food really lives up to its name and is actually spicy. Not all of their food is spicy. Their menu ranges from frogs, alligator, crawfish, gumbo, to various types of crab and oysters. Their drinks are awesome! Their staff is also outgoing and really fun! It is reasonably priced and is a little messy. They do not provide you with utensils, but that is just the atmosphere. There is a hand washing station provided and napkins on the table! It is SOOOO GOOD! I ended up ordering another pound of crab legs for dessert, I could not pass up how AMAZING the food is!! Great Place!!"}
{"text":"Kaitlen, our server, was amazing! Never once did we have to ask for anything, it's like she could read our minds. The food was excellent, as always. This is definitely one of our go to restaurants and we will continue to recommend this place to anyone and everyone. Great service on a busy night, thank you Kaitlen!"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance of this place. It's a very lively environment with the sound of people eating & laughing in the background. A spacious place where you can sit at the table, booth, or the bar. They have TVs around the restaurant. Service is fast and friendly. The waiters/waitresses will spend the time to go over the menu if this is your first time, and make recommendations on their favorites. 

My boyfriend and I usually order seafood here. Between the two of us, we ordered 1 pound of crawfish, shrimps, and clams with medium spicing. I would recommend asking if they have frozen or fresh crawfish. Sometimes the crawfish are frozen depending on the season. Luckily, they had fresh crawfish today! We usually get the trifecta sauce, which includes kajun, lemon pepper, & garlic.  The cajun fries are just right - crunchy on the outside & inside. If you're not into seafood, they also have a meat selection of pulled pork, brisket, ribs, and chicken.   Plastic bibs are provided. I usually tie my hair up in preparation to dig in. Plenty of napkins at the table. A bucket to dispose trash. There's also a sink outside the restroom to wash our hands.  

 I've been to similar places like this in CA, such as Boiling Crab & Kickin Crab. Angry Crab gets 3 stars for decent seafood in AZ - nice location and good service."}

{"text":"How could you not love this place? The service is amazing, the food speaks for itself, AND there's a ton of TV's. I'd come here everyday if I lived right down the street.

EDIT: I live across the street now. By far some of the best seafood and bbq I've had. Julissa (sorry if it's spelled wrong) recommended the salt/pepper/lemon/lime on the side and I LOVED it. It's nice to see a staff that's actually attentive and knows what they're talking about."}
{"text":"Seriously disappointed in our visit on a Tuesday night May 1!  We are regulars here and sat at the bar over 5 minutes with no greeting or acknowledgement.  The manager Chris was standing at the server station with 3 girls just talking.  We left."}
{"text":"I tried Angry Crab tonight for the first time and the food was so delicious! I ordered the snow crab with trifecta seasoning and level 2 (sizzlin) spiciness with a corn on the cob and 2 red potatoes. We ordered cajun fries as an appetizer. The seasoning was out of this world. You don't get plates and you eat with your hands. Fun experience! We are even thinking about going back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"The place gets better and better! I first when it opened. The sauce wasn't quite there, staff was still new. Couple years latter and much improved. 

Love the shrimp, crab, mussels and crawfish. Make sure you ask for the fresh crawfish! Huge difference in taste of they are frozen. One thing they never seem to have have is clams. Please stock up on clams!!! :-)"}
{"text":"I was going to wait until my birthday to try this place out but I couldn't wait so we went last night. I am so glad we went! I am a big seafood lover and this place hit the spot. 

My husband and I ordered a pound of shrimp, king crab legs, and muscles in the trifecta sauce level 2 heat.(it was just the right amount of heat!) We also ordered calimari, bread, and the cajun fries. Everything was absolutley delicious.

We sat outside since it was the first available (the weather was awesome) and service was great. They bring the food out in bags and you eat right from there. Messy, fun, and finger licking good.

Next time we will order a variety of flavors. The trifecta gets old after awhile when you have it on everything. We will also skip the shrimp next time. It was very tough. I also wish they offered you wet napkins afterwards since your hands are covered in sauce and stuff, even after using a bunch of dry napkins!

We will be back again!"}
{"text":"I love coming to Angry Crab! Although there's always at least a 30 minute wait, I don't mind because the food is so delicious. Once you get seated, the service is pretty fast. Our food usually comes within 15 minutes. You can build your own bag with your choice of crab, mussels, clams, whatever you want, and to your desired spicy level. Market prices so it's really reasonable. They don't believe in plates or utensils so be prepared to get down and dirty!"}
{"text":"You gotta try the trifecta salmon comes with veggies. I get a number 2 on spice cuz I could barely finish my meal with a 3. Cajun fries are the bomb if you can get the kitchen to cough them up. Last few times I've ordered a basket either they forget or its not a priority to them since it's not part of a dish I guess. But still delicious food and drinks! Last time I was in they had reggae on and I was in my happy place! Thanks Brandon for your awesome service? You are great!"}
{"text":"Friendly and attentive staff what makes this one better than the ahwatukee one. Great crab legs and calms. The wait is some times a little long but worth the wait."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times. I guess I'd say I've give them several chances. Two of my friends love the place. Last time we went we waited a long time for a waiter just to order. We put in our drink and food order at the same time since the waiter was so slow. We waited a long time for drinks they came out just a few minutes before our food. I'm giving it 3 stars because the food is good. It's not great but it's good. The server was polite and apologetic but we just didn't understand why he was so slow. The place was not packed and he didn't seem to have many tables. He'd just disappear for long periods of time. We never did get a second drink. Even my die hard Angry Crab Shack fans were a bit disturbed."}
{"text":"We made a second trip here as we were all craving the flavorful seafood.  This time they had clam! We were so excited. This time we got crawfish and clam medium trifecta. The clam was so good we ended up ordering more.  One of our bags of crawfish did come out cold, didn't think much of it cause everyone ate a few thinking it was just that one crawfish.. toward the end of the bag I voiced it and everyone said theirs was cold too.  That means the whole bag was practically cold, we told the waitress just so she could let the kitchen know and not serve cold crawfish to other diners.  She was SO nice and brought out another HOT steaming bag of crawfish, we were stuffed but happy.  

Thank you Angry Crab Shack for the amazing customer service and awesome seafood! We will be back soon enough."}
{"text":"We ordered hush puppies and calamari/clam strips as appetizers and omg! The hush puppies were amazing and I typically don't care for hush puppies. For dinner, we ordered a pound of snow crab legs, a pound of shrimp and a pound of crawfish with trifecta sauce and mild spice... Yum. Drinks and service were also good. 

Tip- Bring a marker so you can let those after you know you were there!"}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here and I absolutely love this place. The food is so great, we ordered mussels, crawfish, king crab, and frog legs. Everything was perfect! We were being an annoying and undecided table, but the waitress, Amanda, was so nice  and attentive the entire time, even though she was sooo busy as the place was packed. She even tied up my friend's bib when it fell off! My recommendations, the Cajun spice, and order bread to soak up all that yumminess!"}
{"text":"Not a great atmosphere/ambiance. But really not trying to be an upscale seafood restaurant. I think they're going after the \"fun crab legs place\" a la Dicks Last Resort. 

Good menu, nice selection of crab legs with different spices and sauces. Order by the pound. It comes in a steaming hot plastic bag in a bucket. 

Luckily I came here with my teenage son. My wife would've never gone for it. Open the plastic bag and dig in. Juices up to your elbows, it's a good thing there are industrial sinks situated along the walls to hose yourself down. 

Nice friendly service. Pretty spendy, I can see this being a place a young man chooses for their birthday or other special occasion. 

We had king crab legs and lobster tails, with soft drinks. The bill for the two of us was $70."}
{"text":"I've only had the Cajun crab when I've been here but it's amazing. My only complaint is how messy my hands get!!"}
{"text":"Don't do it! $75! Albertsons grocery store will steam your crab and instead of going out you can buy corn. Potatoes and lemon butter (along with a nice bottle of wine) for half the price."}
{"text":"The crawfish was really awesome all they need now is a live band to make it really authentic"}
{"text":"So this is the thing with this place: i would give 4 stars for the food but the place itself was just okay. 
Let's start with the food then: we got some shrimp, catfish, ribs and brisket. Food was good. I especially enjoyed the brisket and the shrimp. The ribs were okay but I wouldn't order that next time.
For people who lived in Los Angeles, this is similar to the boiling crab except with some bbq as well. 
The thing that was not cool: that siren/loud blasting thingy that goes off for...birthdays that would be my guess? First time was okay but after the 3rd time it definitely ruined my dining experience. 
Next time: take out only!"}
{"text":"If you come here you better order the Cajun fries. It's really hard to find good seafood in Arizona because it's more fresh in California. I always order half pound of shrimp, with sausage, and corn. Or I order oysters and a side of rice!"}
{"text":"*After taking a bite of their BBQ chips and spitting it out*
Me: These chips are stale. 
Hesitant waiter: Well, have you ever had Poore Brothers chips before?
Me: Yes, smell them. 

He didn't smell the chips, however did continue to bring out some more crappy food. The coleslaw was completely tasteless, the bread was so hard I could knock someone out with it, the corn was soggy and overcooked, the seafood was fine, but I definitely wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"My mom was in for a visit and I thought this might be a great place for the whole family to try on her first night in. 

We arrived at 4:30 and went in to make out reservations. Since we liked the quiet outdoors, I requested to be seated there. They took my name and said it would be 15 mins before the new shift came on. That was a new one on me but I didn't really have a problem with the wait so we chilled at a picnic table. When the phone buzzed they said our table was ready. Unfortunately they had forgotten we wanted to be outside and said it would be longer if we wanted to be outside. I went with the one inside.

Crew was still settling in and some had been at a meeting so there was some confusion with our order but it wasn't much a big deal. Right off we ordered fries, fried clams, and hush puppies. Clams were huge! I've never had them that big but they were great. Meaty and full of flavor. Hush puppies were amazing. It had jalapenos in them and I have to say, it was a huge hit. I think I may never be able to eat a normal one again. 

My husband decided on a fried shrimp basket while the kids and my mom and I decided to be more adventurous. We got a bowl of gumbo to split. Spicy with shrimp, sausage and okra. You know it's good when a bay leaf is floating in it. Also go some bean and cornbread. Was not a fan of the beans. Had an odd mixture including butter beans, kidney and brown beans. It was too sweet and just not my thing. Cornbread tasted like jiffy mix. It's totally southern but I was hoping for homemade. 

The bags came and we were set. Both were Cajun and level 2. Got live crawfish and crab. Both we had potatoes added and both were great. As someone mentioned, it's on the sweeter side but I love it with the heat. One thing to be aware of, you will get messy. No way to eat something like that without getting your hands dirty. Plus side, there on sinks ready for hand washing. 

So for 5 people, the tab came to $75 and that seemed about right considering the seafood we had. Fresh and yummy. Totally going back with the kids again. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"It was our first time eating there and not only was the food amazing but the service was wonderful as well.... little bit of a wait for a table but well worth it! Our server Shelby walked us through how the menu work and made sure we enjoyed every bit of our food. She also acknowledged that we had got engaged and got us dessert and yelled it out to the restaurant. If you like crab, lobster, and great service this place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Run don't walk from this place! I have been here several times. My last visit did it for me! My husband and I went here for our 18th wedding anniversary. We both ordered crab and drinks I ordered a margarita and water and my husband ordered a beer. We were seated and after several minutes our server brought my husbands beer with a little surprise in it that looked like chewed up garlic. We asked for a new beer and waited at least 5 minutes more and I finally got my water and margarita and a floater free beer, then ordered. No big deal we said. A couple minutes later we were brought our bibs and scissors. The server dropped my scissors on the floor and said she would bring new ones. By now my trust in her was wavering so I kept an eye on her. She put the floor scissors in her pocket and walk back behind the counter, looked up at the scissor wall, over to the computer and then right back to the table with the floor scissors. She took the clean scissors on the table in front of my husband and moved them in front of me, then pulled out the floor scissors and set them in front of my husband and walked away. I could not believe it!! My husband asked me not to get upset and we asked another server for a new pair that she got from the scissors wall. So be warned if you go here and get Shawna as your server your health an scissors are in her very incapable hands."}
{"text":"I love Angry Crab! The food is always so delicious and the service is awesome. I am addicted to the Cajun fries!"}
{"text":"This is a busy place and customers seemed to be happy.  I was.  I really enjoyed the food.  Good service.  Friendly.  The only part I did not enjoy was the loud noises and sirens and shouting out things I couldn't understand repeatedly by the staff.  I'm sure it's tradition, but it's loud enough without that which interrupts the conversations over at the table. 

But the oysters were fresh and the Alaskan King Crab legs were good.  I will be back and I  have told three people so far to check it out."}
{"text":"After knowing that ACS had been open since last September, we finally managed to get over and give it a try. It is in a beautifully-exteriored restaurant with tons of misters flowing freely. The building is kind of an orange-ish color with white accent doors, which is a cool look. 

We walked in and saw that there was a full bar over to the right and tons of open dining space to the left. After being seated promptly the server took our drink order, the wife had a Coors Light on tap and I had the Hurricane, which was pretty tasty, although in a plastic cup. 

The theme they were going for was really a really casual seafood restaurant, and it actually works, hence the name \"Shack\".

For appetizers we had the Calamari and the Frog Legs. The Calamari looked more like traditional cheese sticks than the round rings I had been accustomed to, so through me for a loop, but they were definitely decent. The Frog Legs were really delicious, however i would like to note that it all was a result of the incredible breading. If I happened to catch a bit of just the meat itself, it was quite bland.

The entrees we ordered were the King Crab and the Catfish. The wife really enjoyed her Catfish and I my King Crab. I will say that the Cajun flavoring with the King Crab was a good combination, I just struggled a bit with opening up the legs (King Crab are the kind that have sharp points all over). 

The corn bread was really delicious , and a nice addition to their menu.

We brought our 2 boys, aged 10 and 4, and our older son wanted to swap out his entree because he thought it would be something else (nothing negative about the restaurant for this, just his perception of what he thought he was going to get). Our waitress Maddie seemed confused at the idea of swapping out our kid's entree, so we just told her that we would add/pay for a 2nd one.

For dessert we had the Cheesecake and Chocolate Cake. They were decent, nothing special, but good.

The tab was $92 plus tip. For 2 adults and 2 kids who ordered 2 alcoholic beverages, 2 appetizers, 2 desserts, 5 meals, we were happy with the tab overall.

When we left at 6:15pm on a Friday night they were quoting a 35-40 minute wait."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Definately looking forward to more great experiences in the future."}
{"text":"Omg this place was so good.we will come back very soon pulled pork sandwich was good and the shrimp in the bag was my husbands favorite"}
{"text":"Pretty good for fried seafood in Az.  I debated giving this place four stars because its pretty good, especially for Az, but I do need to try to be consistent and gave it 3 stars.  I'd compare this place to a poor man's version of Acme Oyster House in New Orleans.  Similar menu and concept, just not as good.

The shrimp were ok
The cajun fries were delicious
The hush puppies were ok

Service was a little slow, especially during lunch."}
{"text":"Very close to home, we were all looking forward to going.  Such a disappointment.  The menu is totally confusing,  and the snotty waitress ( wish I remembered her name) .  When we were trying to decipher the confusing menu,  she was very annoyed with us and let us know it in no uncertain terms.  When she circled our utensils on the table , she let us know she would check to see if they were put back,  We could hear
 a server at another table explaining the menu very patiently.  No interest in going back, too many other good places with great service  to go to in the area,  I couldn't say if the food was that great or not,  the lousy server ruined the meal for us.  Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Get here early cause there is always a wait but let me tell ya, it's worth it!!I've never received bad service here. The food is amazing. Make sure you have your bib on, cause get ready for a messy good time! They bring out your food still in the steam bags. Don't be surprised that your seafood still has eyes and everything! That's part of the fun is cracking and pulling apart everything! I have not ventured out with the different hotness levels. The medium and trifecta combo is perfect if you want a great taste with a little kick. 

The Cajun fries are awesome as well! 

Great places with a great atmosphere. The only reason for the 4 stars, is the wait. Other than that, one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"Mary our server was great, she never let my glass get empty, even as busy as she was.   Meal was serve quickly and have determined the cat fish basket and gumbo are my favorite.   I have tried other items but they can be pricey,   wish they had a half pound size or some type of sampler platter."}
{"text":"This place is one of my fiancé's favorite places to eat. He usually orders the Shrimp boil, which is delicious! I just don't like pulling the heads off the shrimp. Yuk! I usually order a Poboy or get a boil with just sausage veggies and potatoes. If you are uncertain as to which spices you should add in your boil just get the trifecta it's amazing! Make sure when you order the level of spiciness you consider trying a 1 first. I'm a big spicy food fan but the level 2 is pretty spicy. 

If you are in the area and like pulling heads off of shrimps and cracking crab legs, I defiantly recommend you give this place a try. 

Shout out to the waiters for always being so kind and attentive!"}
{"text":"I came here the other day and ordered a pound of shrimps and a pound of mussles and they came with corn! I absolutely loved it! Other than the food being so darn good, the atmosphere made me feel like I'm on a pier near a beach, so much fun eating everything even when it gets super messy, not recommended for a first date though lol"}
{"text":"Got the king crab and not only delicious but was fun  lol!! 
It's a bit loud but had fun.   Our waitress was pretty awesome. 
The sides were not that good so 4 stars"}
{"text":"I have been to this place  twice in two weeks if that is any indication of the deliciousness that awaits. No, it is not cheap. Yes, your fingers will be a mess.  Yes, it gets packed. BUT it is oh so good. I have ordered the king crab legs with sausage, corn and potato with trifecta and a side of cornbread on both trips. It was awesome each time. I will eventually try other items on the menu as I will definitely return  in the near future...If you are familiar with the Boiling Crab  this place is an almost exact replica...However, I was told by my server on my first trip that there is no affiliation..."}
{"text":"Started off great but waitress and cooks messed up the order simple 2 lbs craw trifecta and some corn , sausage and potatoes pretty basic .  they forgot the corn potatoes and sausage so I thought maybe come separate but of course our waitress never came back had to call her and ask she then said do you still want or cancel ..lol  wow that's part of the experience in showing my son how its done . she then brought back a back with stuff in it no sauce come on boiled with no flavor . all in all spoke to management and colin made it right and comp the meal . we haven't been back since but the food from what we tried was pretty good .. bad service and mistakes a definte .. oh ya lets not say they where busy only about 10 people in and the time .."}
{"text":"The shrimp basket I had was amazing, best in the area!  Service was wonderful and the cleanliness was prime! I was recommended by a friend and I don't regret it. The flavor of the sauce was awesome!"}
{"text":"Went there with a big group. The wait time was spot on with what they told us. Plenty of fun atmosphere to keep you entertained while you wait. 

Service was great. Our big group took time to decide and they were patient and also attentive. 

Food was really tasty. Most of us got the shrimp boil in a bag. This was just like the meals our family always eat at the beach. Great flavor and a good amount of food. Others had pork sandwiches and enjoyed them too. 

We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Yes!!! My new fav place!!!! I think the seasoning was my favorite part! The Trifecta is a mix of garlic, lemon pepper and Cajun spices. I got the mix bag special which had shrimp and clams in it. It's also included corn, sausage and a potato. All of that was $13! The prices are great here. I expected something like this to be so much more expensive. A non-happy hour house white wine was $4!!! My husband got the barbecue brisket and also liked it. For two glasses of wine, my seafood, two beers and the brisket... Our total bill was $49! For super large portions and flavorful food... That was a steal! My new favorite place give it a try :-)"}
{"text":"We loved this place. They do serve very differently. Barb let us now how it all worked before ordering. We had the calamari to start. The calamari was good but unevenly seasoned some parts were really salty. But the calamari its self was good and you get a good size basket of them. First off you order by the pound and when its after a busier day you may be forced to buy over a two pound lobster or crab if you want that because the options run low as the business gets busy. But that would be too much of the same thing for us. So we ordered the shrimp with trifecta sauce and medium spices as well as mussels with garlic medium. They give it to you in a bag with the side inside. I had the sausage and corn which was bomb. The waiters were all uppity several of them  with quirky personalities. You can make a mess of your meal, they lay paper for the tables and give you a bucket to throw the shells in. Everything needs to be cracked and shelled unless you order the heads off the of the shrimp for 2 dollars more. Definitely will go back and have already told several people that they should come here. Oh and there is plenty to read on the wall."}
{"text":"Food was great but didn't have the best experience. My fiancé wanted a beer and showed his ID for the man to accuse him of having a fake and denied him the alcohol when the ID was clearly valid and real. Wasn't too keen on how we were treated during or after that, but the food was yummy and the fries were delish!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat every once in a while. If I ate here all the time I'd be in the hospital for the highest cholesterol ever!!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for one of our friends birthday.. She loves having her birthday dinner here.. The staff are friendly, especially the waiter we had yesterday he even was talking about Pokemon with couple of our friends ..  My boyfriend ordered the snow crabs and I got the gumbo and a side of beans.. All were pretty good with no complaints.. My friend ordered the Dungeness crab and she loved it.. She said you get the most with ur money by ordering the Dungeness crab (have to order at least 2 lbs of it).. We also like that they serve local beer .."}
{"text":"First time there tonight and food was excellent! Great price for what you get and it came out super fast! Our waitress was super nice and on top of it the entire evening! I will definitely be back! Give it a try, totally fun and delicious experience!"}
{"text":"I think I may actually like Angry Crab better than Hot N Juicy ...

For only being open for 3 days, AC has seem to have it down. A crowded restaurant, but didn't have to wait too long for seating. They have the Cajun style seafood with the addition of fried sides and even BBQ.

Of course I had to try their Trifecta sauce and shrimp and decided to go for the frozen crawfish and Tamarind sauce just to try- both with Medium heat. The latter you should pass on. Also decided to try their fried soft shell crab with cajun fries and some soda.

Their shrimp seems so much bigger here, fresh and their Trifecta sauce was well balanced. Their sauce isn't too liquidy or dry, overly salty but good cajun flavor. 

Pass on the Tamarind sauce as it was overly salty, way spicier than Medium and had a strong fishy taste to it. Nothing close to what Tamarind really tastes like, the frozen crawfish is to be expected. Dense and not fresh tasting- but I knew that ordering it for $8 a pound.

Great service! Checked back on often, refilled drinks and I love that they provide lemons or limes and all kinds of hot sauces.

Can't wait to come back to try some of their BBQ! It does get pretty rowdy in here, if you're looking for that kind of environment as well."}
{"text":"Great place!  Went today for lunch for the first time and both my husband and I really liked it and the atmosphere was the BOMB!   We grew up in the Bay Area and one of our favorite places to eat was a place called Joe's at Westlake because they had the best crab Louie salad ever!  Huge chunks of crab, egg, tomato, pickle etc.  my suggestion is to add crab Louie to your menu!  We can't find anyone around the area that makes one!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant for the seafood lover.  We tried a variety of different items.  I can say it is a little pricey, but I will definitely be going there again."}
{"text":"We stoped by here once before on a weekend and the place had an hour or longer wait. We were on our way home from work and thought we would try it. So with that said we now can say we gave been here twice. First and last time. Oysters had a yellow milky juice and stunk. Ordered the salmon and snow crab next, both overcooked and very dry.  Needless to say we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"*WARNING* *WARNING* 
Consuming the Kajun sauce a top of your sea critters will cause sudden urges to travel to New Orleans to make worse decisions than spending $20 on a bag of ocean crustaceans before rent is due. Yes it was $20 but oh my was it worth it! Our server (who's name escapes me) was very pleasant  and I would most definitely recommend to anyone who isn't afraid of sea food and likes to have a good time. I had an awful lot of fun and will be returning."}
{"text":"Wow...we finally tried this place and it's phenomenal!

Traditional seafood boils, plastic baggies, no dishes, just ol' bay and big ol' mess. What out for the spices, they can add up and make sure you order one of everything on the menu...at least once!"}
{"text":"The shrimp in trifecta is simply amazing. I do not know what they do to their shrimp to make it taste so good and have such a great texture, but whatever they are doing, I wish everyone else that cooked shrimp would do. This is always such a fun outing. I do like cozy quiet places, and this place is not that. I guess it's just the atmosphere that promotes rowdy customers. But the food is worth the inconvenience and I will continue to come back."}
{"text":"I went here last week , after work with my boyfriend. We didn't have to wait, we were seated immediately. This was around 5:30 pm. The atmosphere was festive and the décor was graffiti. I ordered the brisket with baked beans and potato salad. The brisket came out plain with the sauce on the side. I don't prefer it that way, I like it served covered in sauce. It was tasty though. The beans were good although it was a very tiny side. I gave the potato salad to my boyfriend in exchange for his Cajun fries which were very good. He ordered the charred oysters, which he seemed to like. The oysters came with bread which I wish my waiter would have let us know, cause we ordered a extra side of bread that we did not eat. Good thing it was only $1 extra. This was ok for a first time try, next time I will try out some of the good looking drinks."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night during a work trip (party of one! woohoo!) and turned the 30-minute wait into a 10-minute wait by grabbing a seat at the bar. Bartender was super nice. I was torn between the seafood and the BBQ, but ended up going with the soft shell crab \"angry basket\" because Crab is listed before BBQ on the sign on the door. I'm not a HUGE seafood guy in the first place, so the crab was a little fishy for my tastes, but the killer seasoning made up for it. Also comes with a thick, spicy/spiced dip which could have used a little more kick but I know I could have asked for it. Had it with a Grand Canyon Sunset Amber and the total with tip came to just over $20. Not bad! Next time I'll go with the BBQ for comparison."}
{"text":"Simply LOVE this place! Fresh food, fun atmosphere, good service. They have an extensive seafood menu, but there are meat dishes for folks who do not like to get down and dirty. Their Cajun and lemon pepper sauce mix is my favorite. If you happen to be there on your birthday, the whole place will send their good wishes and a horn will sound in hour honor, not to mention a free desert.
Seafood is ordered by pound and served in a plastic bag - no plates required. Snow crab legs and shrimp have been my choice every time I came here."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews and friends at work raving about Angry Crab Shack in Mesa the hubby and I thought we'd give it a shot since we love seafood. We orders 1 lb of king crab, order of sausage, 2 corns, 2 red potatoes trifecta heat and ate the entire bag and was SO full. I ordered 1 lb of snow crabs same sides and didn't get done with  half the crab and ate 1 sausage and was insanely full! My 3 yr old got the fried shrimp kids meal w/regular fries. The food was delicious!! However could only give 3 stars since my toddler received cold shrimp (in the middle was frozen still :() and cajun fries I'm lucky I checked the food before he ate it or his mouth would've been on Fire from the fries! the waitress didn't come around for a while but lucky enough the sweet waitress next to our booth asked how we liked the food and we nicely explained the mistake or error in which she apologized and explained our waitress was new and she vowed to make it right....in which she did basket of fries on the house and a new chicken strip basket was provided (toddler no longer wanted shrimp) with regular fries. Other than the new waitress or cold & spicy food for our little guy the atmosphere seemed cool it was our first time so I was hoping for a little more excitement from the staff though the atmosphere has the potential to be a fun spot though."}
{"text":"was pretty good for our first time. The manager / supervisor on duty was helpful with picking out a fun drink and gave advice on a meat to pick. We wanted to try crawfish since we have never had but they did not have it in. I assume a seasonal thing. But we did have the blue crab and mussels... delish .. will have to come back when they have crawfish for sure."}
{"text":"Waiting time in Saturday dinner time is usually 30 minutes. If you don't know what to do during your waiting, there is a sprouts for you to do grocery shopping hahaha.Try Dungeness crab!"}
{"text":"Went there for New Year's eve dinner. Absolutely fab!! Snow crab legs in either garlic or lemon seasoning. Don't like the trifecta it's too much flavor and it overpowers the crab legs. Absolutely love this place! Great happy hour to"}
{"text":"4 stars only cause he messed up my drink orders.  Everything else was delicious!  I highly recommend ordering the seafood in a bag, messy but worth it!  I had the salmon with veggies."}
{"text":"We are always looking for restaurants that know how to do it right. We were absolutely surprised by how good this place is. We went back for the second time to see if it was a fluke the first time (shrimp, potatoes, sausage boil) Tonight, we tried the king crab boil  and the catfish. Both dishes came out fast and were better than expected.  Catfish was a good size with plenty of fries seasoned in a cajun spice. Crab was fresh and seasoned just the right amount. 
We have to give a huge round of applause to our server, Chris. He was happy to be there, checked on us the right amount of times, and made sure we had everything we needed. Great job!
 From the outside it doesn't look like much, but don't let the strip center facade fool you. Best place for seafood and bbq we have found."}
{"text":"Came here for a date night. This place is amazing. The food was great atmosphere was fun. Only downside is the wait time can be awful. We waited 1.5hrs on a friday evening. They have a great app that tells you your place in line but i couldn't fathom waiting 1.5hrs with both our kids and they don't take reservations for parties under 15 people so that has kept us from coming back."}
{"text":"Great dinner!  The food was delicious.  I gave it 3 stars because of the price and our to go order had a few items incorrect and left off."}
{"text":"First time eating here and we left with a very good impression about it.  Our drinks came to us soon after we sat down, I ordered the catfish and cajun fries and it was very good.  The fish was done a little softer than I like, but the flavor was there along with the fries.  My wife and daughter ordered the sliders and they couldn't stop eating them.  I am partial to Pappadeuxs, but this place still hit a homerun"}
{"text":"This place has amazing people! I was greeted by a friendly gentleman, really tall, and then proceeded to let them know that I wanted to order something for take out. I was greeted by an amazing woman, I believe her name is Kat? Great service and attitude! I came in around 10:30 and I knew they were closing soon, I had a coworker recommend them and I am a lover of seafood, so what could possibly go wrong?! Absolutely. Nothing. I came after a long day at work and definitely would not recommend a place any more than I am recommending this one. I have just left the store, less than a few minutes ago, and cannot express how happy I am with the service and food. Amazing people, atmosphere, and seafood. Yes yes yes!"}
{"text":"**WARNING LONG REVIEW**It was my birthday yesterday. A few friends have raved about this establishment. With my husband & son HUGE seafood fanatics, I chose this place to celebrate my birthday with my family. The wait wasn't too bad for how busy they were. We were seated at our table: which was originally a table for 4...but we'll get to that later.  Upon getting situated we were semi-promptly greeted by Taylor. Side note: kuddos to Taylor for being able to write her name upside down on the paper that lined our booth's table. She took our drink orders. Promptly returned with two beers & a Sprite for my son. Asked if we were ready to order. Mind you, my husband & I worked all day & were not afforded the opportunity to eat much, as we were quite busy.  We asked for a recommendation on an appetizer or where they fell into the \"flow\" of the menu. She sighed, looked to her right then with the tip of her pen, dabbed the middle of the menu. She half heartedly recommended the clams or calamari. Choosing the latter, we waited. She came back roughly 3 minutes later to see if we were ready to place our order. We made mention, again that this was our first time here. She quickly snapped off w/a \"OK, I'll give you a few more minutes\" walking away without ANY advice. Upon her arrival with our appetizer, I loudly said her name as she tried to briskly drop the basket & leave. She turned around & I explained to her that this was our first time here & completely unknowing w/how this establishment works. She briefly described the rundown. We enjoyed our appetizer & as a family; figured out what we'd be ordering for our main course. We waited...& waited...drinks empty....appetizer completed....WE WAITED. All the while, Taylor seemed to feel as though her sidework took precedence. I finally was able to catch her attention after shouting her name as she blindingly strolled passed us. She turned around & took our order. Then briskly moved on w/o offering a refill to my son's drink or offer my husband & I another beer. As those frosted white solo cups are quite see through. 20ish minutes later, a super sweet gentleman came over to start delivering our dinner. Please keep in mind: we ordered 2 pounds of king crab, 1 lobster, 2 pounds of headless shrimp, 1 pound of snow crab, potatoes & sausage. This is easily a $200+ bill. Bag after bag, he delivered. He even completed our requested refills & brought them over to our table. I reached into my purse & tipped the gentleman who so willingly & promptly helped us. He said he couldn't take it, but I insisted. I made mention that in the last 15 minutes, he's been more helpful than Taylor was in the last hour. We had one bag left. (The lobster) as they take longer. Enjoying our dinner & having a great family night out, my husband looked over & took notice that the kind gentleman that was so proficient in ensuring we were taken care of; was addressing the one & only: TAYLOR.  Unbeknownst to me, I tipped the MANAGER ? Well, wouldn't you know it, Taylor took note & was literally suctioned to our booth. As appreciated as it was to see a strong backbone from the management staff, it was already a little too late as we literally had everything we needed. To say it was overkill is an understatement. My brother finally got off work & joined us. While all in all it was a great night spent with my family, We probably will not be returning simply due to the fact that if you're anticipating a $300 bill with a tip....you'd think the service would be a little better or they'd hire more competent staff."}
{"text":"We got the Snow Crab legs with the trifecta seasoning, Cajun fries, and fried calamari...it was all amazing!! Loved how casual and laid back it was. Service was great too, super friendly staff!! I would definitely recommend to anyone who doesn't mind getting a little messy :)"}
{"text":"The angry crab is a such a great place! Me and my fiancé come here at least once a month. The shrimp is amazing with a nice cold purple haze!. The service is always top notch! Shelby is our go to server. She is friendly, attentive and knows how to tailor a dining experience!! With all our years in serving it's obvious that Shelby really knows how to turn a dinning experience into an unforgettable time! Next time you are at the angry crab in Mesa ask for her!"}
{"text":"As many of you know, this is Phoenix's take on a boiling crab, and I'm sure the owner (who I found out is from LA) had heard enough about its comparison.  This place is fairly new so I'm sure they are working on a couple of things. One thing that bothered me was the fact that their menus are printed on computer paper and were very dirty and falling apart. I would suggest getting someone to design a nicer looking one (everything was off center and ugly) and maybe laminating them. It was also pretty annoying that they don't have the prices of their shrimp, crab, crawfish on the menu. And if the market prices really differ that often, at least make the prices visible from the tables. Everyone kept having to get up and look for the prices, we finally just took a picture and sent it to out.  The next thing I would hope they change is their tablecloths. With their dining experience going towards eating off of the tablecloths and whatnot, these blue plaid ones that rip as soon as you put something on it will not do. If this is to continue I would say give everyone plates (even if its paper/plastic), I was turned off when my shrimp immediately soaked through the tablecloth and touched the bare wooden table. The service also needs a bit of work since we asked for water more that 5 times and continued to be let down, which is not good when you're eating something spicy. They have young looking servers so I wont be too hard on them. Now for the food. The fries were EXTREMELY GOOD and the portion size was big. We ended up getting two pounds of Hot Trifecta shrimp. I would say it was pretty gdelicious and the spice wasn't too much. I think they might soak the shrimp a little less than BC since the shrimp wasn't completely saturated. As leftover the next day however, the shrimp had soaked up the sauce and it even tasted more spicy than when we got it fresh--it was good. Next time we might share a pound and get a pound of something else to mix it up. The decor is a complete rip-off of BC but hey, if it works it works---got my writing on the walls."}
{"text":"A southerners dream! I crave low country boil all the time and this is my go to spot. The service is always fast and efficient. All of the combinations they offer are awesome. A nice cold beer is the perfect addition to your meal especially if you get something spicy. Make sure you don't get too dressed up it can get pretty messy. A nice taste of the South when I'm feeling homesick."}
{"text":"Food was great! First time there and everyone was incredibly kind even with the extreme busy ness of the place! They have a very interesting way of serving and their sauces are incredibly delicious!"}
{"text":"Came from Ca and were craving Cajun shrimp. We didn't mind waiting up to an hour to seat a family of 15. The hostess seemed bothered that we wanted to sit a huge party at 7:30, they close at 9 and they were trying to tell us that we may not have time to order everything we want to order. She told coworkers about the large party we had and they all had long faces ( they did not hide their reactions either), making us feel like we were horrible customers for brining such a large party at 7:30. There were so many empty tables around the restaurant, but the lady continued to say we may be seated at 8pm. They sat us down right away because apparently a \"large\" party of 12 people had canceled a couple minutes after we said we were going somewhere else. We were originally going to go to another shrimp place, but after comparing the reviews we decided to come to this place. After the horrible service with the hostess, our server was amazing. I would give the server 10 stars, but the overall rating of the hostess and the other employees making a big deal out of nothing, I would give them 0 if I could."}
{"text":"Loved this place.
Crab was fantastic, shrimp a little soggy, but still delicious."}
{"text":"I had the crayfish at the Cajun Festival and have to say it was worth waiting almost an hour in line to have my first ever bucket of crayfish. I got the level 3 and it was quite spicy. Very messy, but wonderful"}
{"text":"Best place for seafood in the Mesa area.  Great service reasonable prices.   Definitely stop by if your in the area."}
{"text":"What a fun place! This my friends is an experience. You pick your seafood, they bring it to you in a bag, you tear it apart and eat it. Chuck the rest in the bucket. Its great, really tasty and fun. If your squeamish about tearing apart your food and eyeballs and guts go for something a little on the beginner side. But all in all i would recommend this place to anyone. Its great for kids, loud, and your kids can color on the paper tables. Be sure to get there early because they do get busy."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

This review is, as with many others, based upon comparisons to this type of restaurants' peers.  So, in this case, comparisons to Boiling Crab and Hot n' Juicy aren't just justified, but I'd say pretty darn necessary.  And the basic verdict is this - this location of Angry Crab is excellent.  My wife and I have been many times and will return again and again until something dramatically alters what they do.

Our go-to combination is the Trifecta sauce at a 2 (medium).  This is the same combo I typically go for at Boiling Crab in California.  By giving this place 5 stars doesn't take away from Boiling Crab at all.  These two 5-star joints aren't mutually exclusive.  What I further appreciate about Angry Crab being here is the typical lack of extensive waiting (unlike Boiling Crab), and it is a touch cheaper.  From the shrimp to even the lobster, market price is a very fair price.  I only typically take exception with the clams.  They're exceptionally shell-heavy and when you're paying by the pound, you certainly don't feel like you're getting good value.  

If you have a choice between fresh or frozen crawfish, opt for fresh.  As for sides, we've tried the rice, fries, gumbo, alligator nuggets, and the po'boy.  The rice is often undercooked.  Skip the po'boys, they're very weak compared to those in Louisiana.  The alligator nuggets are fine, no complaints.  The gumbo is above average.  And for some odd reason, we love the Cajun fries here.  I'm sure they're just frozen fries from a bag, but we love them.  

Part of it may be the festive atmosphere, but there is no better feeling in the world than digging into 2 pounds of peel & eat shrimp with a cold beer."}

Came to this location for the first time to specifically try the BBQ.  My wife and I typically go to the Mesa location and just order bags of seafood.  As a BBQ snob, had to give it a try.

Started out with an order of the gumbo and I think I've mentioned this before, the gumbo is great here.  Okra thickened, not too much rice, plenty of sausage, and enough seafood to make it worth it.  It has a good kick without adding any additional hot sauce and it is filling - as it should be.  

Got a 1/2 lb order of the brisket along with potato salad and the beans.  Barely perceptible smoke ring around the edge of the brisket and not much bark on it - so I was a little dubious.  Tried a bit without the sauce.  It is tender, quite tender.  So that started to save it.  But the brisket on its own without anything with it lacked a little flavor.  It definitely needed a sauce.  the choices were their original BBQ and a mustard-based sauce.  I asked for both on the side.  Both were decent, with the slight edge going to the mustard sauce.  Good mustard kick to it.  As with any good Texas BBQ, came with a slice of plain white bread.

The beans were pretty darn good.  3 or 4 different kinds of beans, bits of meat for flavor, thickened enough in the pot to be not too watery and plenty filling.  I would venture to say that these are some of the best side of beans in the Valley.

The potato salad on the other hand, was not good.  Server told us it was Cajun-spiced potato salad, but I failed to notice any Cajun spice at all, nor any other spice for that matter.  It was totally bland and not worth your time or stomach real estate.

Don't come expecting Texas-style BBQ.  And don't come expecting amazing BBQ.  Based on the brisket alone, this was pretty good BBQ, worth at least a try.  Is there better BBQ in the Valley?  Yes, much more.  Can you get great seafood and gumbo along with it?  Probably not.  The rating here reflects the idea that the sum of the parts here are greater than the whole, saved by sides and seafood.  And since I'm here to rate restaurants, not just dishes,I'm comfortable with this 4-star rating."}
{"text":"I am Obsessed with the Angry Crab! The staff are friendly, the atmosphere is fun and casual! Wonderful fresh shellfish! Get the trifecta, the buttery flavor and spicy is perfect with any of the fresh and well priced seafood they have! Don't forget to order bread to soak up to sauce! This is a messy meal so don't wear your favorite shirt or take a first date!"}
{"text":"The only word I can use to describe this place is WOW. I had been hearing about how amazing their seafood was for months and had to go see what all the hype was about. I ordered a pound of shrimp and crab with the Trifecta sauce and a level 2 hot and added some potatoes and corn on the cob and it was absolute heaven!! Overall favorite was the crab, corn bread was pretty fantastic as well. This is definitely going to be one of my new favorite spots."}
{"text":"Great messy fooding experience. Had a pound of snow crab legs, corn on the cob, and a potato in a medium (2) spicy trifecta sauce. The crab legs were fantastic. The corn was great and soaked up all the yummy sauce. The potato wasn't really needed...

The shrimp in the poboy was fried, and overall pretty delicious and the slaw cooled my mouth from the trifecta sauce. The bread was a bit hard though..

The fried clams were ok. Large pieces but seemed overly fried.

I liked the convenience of the auto sink, soap, and paper towel dispenser near the kitchen. 

Staff was friendly. Food came out fast. So filling, couldn't even finish everything! Fun, messy experience."}
{"text":"We got here around 4:30pm on a Saturday and there was no wait. However, by 5:30pm
the place was packed and there was a few people in line. 

We had Candice as our server and she was amazing! Very thorough at explaining everything, giving recommendations, refilling drinks promptly, and checking in a few times to see how we were doing.

We started off with the hush puppies. Delicious! Definitely order those. We ordered the snow crab legs and shrimp with a few red potatoes in the trifecta sauce. I can handle spicy, but my mom can not. We ordered the trifecta sauce in a 1 and there was a kick to it! Our server did say they run spicier than normal so order a number down, and she definitely was right! So beware that a level 1 is more like a medium-hot. The trifecta sauce is delicious and flavorful. I highly recommend this place!

FYI: you can ask for plastic gloves to wear when you're eating so that you're not smelling like a fisherman for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME!! Fed my family of 5 for about 80 dollars, and the kids had quite the expieriece! I suggest the trifecta sauce spicy level zero, because spicy level 2 made me sweat. You can draw on the walls and eat with your hands. It was delish!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome and fresh. What keeps me coming back is Diane. She is the best waitress there!! Very attentive to your needs, never in a bad mood, always friendly and provides great service to all customers. I go there every 2 weeks for lunch and I know when she is working I will be happy with my visit.  Kudos to Diane!!!"}
{"text":"This place got recommended to me by 2 co-workers, went here today. 

Let's start with the service. Our waiter looked like he was either new or just didn't want to be there. He rarely checked in on us and we had to ask other waiters for things. We even had the shift manager looking in on us. Our waiter wasn't very good, but the other staff were friendly and helpful. 

Onto the food. I ordered the fried cod basket with cole slaw and a side of hush puppies. Let's just say the cod at Long Johns is way better and gives more of a portion. The cole slaw was very bland and tasteless. It looked good, but no flavor at all. Ah, the hush puppies. You can tell they are not freshly made and are frozen. My order was served warm on the outside, cold on the inside. Let's just say it wasn't a one time occurrence, as the second order came exactly the same. My Cajun fries were good though. The manager did make up the mistake with a free dessert. That was nice of him to offer that. 

I will give this place a second chance, so I can try the broiler menu. So stay tuned...."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Must get the King Crab. Everything was fresh and perfectly seasoned. Glad there is a second location now closer to home. Can't wait to try it."}
{"text":"I Crave it everyday. A long wait but totally worth it! Yummmmmmm  hungry just thinking about it."}
{"text":"So happy to have Angry Crab  close to home! First visit lived up to the other locations awesomeness! We'll be back often! 
Shrimp, snow Crab and sausage add-ins!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! My first time here and the staff was wonderful. One of our items took too long to come out. We asked them to just cancel that order we can share all the food we purchased. Well they still brought out the item at no charge and complimentary dessert! GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! That is very hard to find here in PHX. The food was so good. So many varieties. When the bags of food come out it don't seem like a lot of food at 1pound. Until you start eating and realize it more than enough. This place was amazing and I am already planning on going back soon! Great job staff and cooks! A+++++"}
{"text":"We have never had a bad experience with the place... awesome fresh food, delicious seasoning, and a different type of cuisine than you'd expect in the desert.  They fly in fresh seafood from various sources and nothing - with the exception of perhaps the chicken tenders - is frozen.  You *must* try the hush puppies and the cornbread - both are heavenly.  Not healthy of course but worth their weight in calories!"}
{"text":"I am a New Orleans native, My brother-in-law was a five star chef there. I ordered the snow crab and shrimp boil with the sausage, corn and potatoes. My family said I started speaking creole again. LOL I chose the hot recipe, it had me sweating . It was so delicious I suffered through the hotness. Although I will order the medium  next time. I plan on going through the entire menu, one day at a time. LOL (5 plus stars)!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Pound of shrimp, trifecta at a 2 and a corn, potato and sausage is the way to go! All kinds of good appetizers like alligator tail and hush puppies. If you go to the ahwatukee location, get the crab pie! Lots of cool beers too. If you have the money, get yourself a Dungeness crab or king crab legs to get the full experience! Birthdays are a blast there and if you can find a spot on the wall you can leave your mark!"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous!!!!!  Seafood beyond compare and the Trifecta sauce is unbelievable!  In addition, the service made the place so much fun and welcoming - Thank you, Terry!!!!  Also Stephanie.  Will be back often!"}
{"text":"We have gone to the Alma School location and were pretty underwhelmed. Tried this location out on Saturday and were very pleased.

GO EARLY. We got there at 5 and they were very busy. By 6:45, they were on a wait. When we had tried the Alma School location, it was an hour wait. This place gets slammed.

Started with the raw oysters (super fresh, no grit or fishy taste), a mason mule (refreshing & really well mixed; try it with peach), and beer. They have a good craft selection if that's your thing, running the gamut from milk stouts to Mr. Pineapple. 

We moved onto the piles of seafood. 1 lb snow crab in trifecta level 1, and 1 lb king crab in lemon pepper (FYI, if you just felt like crab with drawn butter, that is the closest you will get). Both were amazing. Don't forget to shove your hand back in the bag and sop the meat up once you crack it out. Also threw some sausage, potatoes & corn on the cob in there. The sausage is pretty spicy and I abandoned it after 2 pieces, but the corn & potatoes are great in the sauces. 

They get a solid 5 stars because of the staff. Our oysters & drinks all came out almost immediately, and our server (Tori) was on top of the beer refills, even bringing tons of limes. 

The cherry on top: fiance ordered a second round of crab, which came out ice cold. Tori felt it with her finger, whisked it back, and within 10 minutes he had a new bag (this one steaming hot). She double checked after the first leg was cracked, and we could tell she actually was interested in making sure it was hot... and then informed us it had been comped. I was shocked (in a good way) that they were that willing to comp a $28 order of king crab just like that AND give us a whole new bag. Usually it's one thing or the other, but dang! They must really want happy guests."}
{"text":"Went here and watched as a server talks shit about people and make a to-do order, touching food without gloves. She had no personality, didn't smile and seemed to really hate her job. Came here for my boyfriend's bday and the other location that is out of the way for us is way better. Food was amazing though and hostess was awesome."}
{"text":"The Boiling Crab is famous in California. I was excited when Angry Crab Shack opened in Phoenix/Arcadia (because honestly who was going to drive to Mesa to eat there?). The food is amazing if you like seafood. It's definitely an experience and this location also has BBQ (but who really comes here for BBQ when you're getting seafood boils?). A must try!"}
{"text":"The best seafood place in town. This place must believe in voodoo because they magically make me keep coming back for more crab legs."}
{"text":"I ate, or attempted to eat at Angry Crab Shack in Mesa last weekend for a family member's birthday ( large party). I read Yelp reviews before arriving, so felt the food would be good, and accordingly, arrived hungry. I ordered fried oysters, potato salad, and hush puppies with great expectations. My food arrived, and was I ever disappointed. The oysters were small doughy globs of batter with a few pieces of what appeared to be oysters but tasted of a mild chemical flavor ( not food related). The potato salad had a passable flavor but the potatoes had the texture of canned potatoes. I ate a bit of this because I was starving. My hush puppies were like small hard balls of cake dough, too sweet for hush puppies. The person on my right ordered a family size mixed vegetable side that arrived in a giant, clear plastic bag submerged in sauce and resembling medical waste. I couldn't bring myself to sample it, but those who did said it was too spicy. Every few minutes, literally, employees would burst into startlingly loud singing, yelling and bell ringing, possibly celebrating a diner birthday or someone ordering a special drink or dish ( hard to imagine anything worthy at this place), so conversation was difficult and nerves jangled. I left hungry, but grateful to go, as I felt like I had escaped from hell."}
{"text":"Ask for Tim he was awesome  great food and service.  I had the fried catfish and the shrimp. Great  start to my 8th wedding  the anniversary week end"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying \"holy cow!!\" This was our first time here.  We had the king crab, shrimp, mussels & crawfish. All were medium spiced (a bit on the mild side) and trifecta. We also had hush puppies, onion rings, fries & fried calamari. The king crab and calamari were the favorites at our table. The hush puppies were tasty and moist. We ordered corn bread, but they were out (noon on a Sunday? Wow) The service was very good but the food came out in odd spurts and we did have to ask for missing items. It is a lot of fun and really messy! The hand washing stations are a cool benefit!"}
{"text":"Make sure your read my review in its entirety... Here's my biggest complaint... How can you call yourself Angry Crab, yet every time I come to an Angry Crab, you have no Dungeness Crabs??? The name says Crab, then you should have some crab on hand!!!! I could understand if it was late in the evening but less than 2 hours of being open you ain't got no Crab??? c'mon man!!!...

I shared the same exact comments with our server and then later when the manager came by to check on how we were enjoying the meal. I jokingly told him 'great, if I had some crab'. This guy recognized my sarcasm, embraced it & rolled with it. Most importantly, he was genuine when he said if I could get it for you, I would!!! That went a long way with us...

The size & layout of this location I like & the bonus here is that they serve bbq & make fresh pizzas. We ordered the ribs and brisket, with the beans & coleslaw. Also had the kids fried shrimp & fries, along with 2lbs of shrimp. Meal, service and atmosphere was good and I appreciated the way the manger talked with me when I shared my frustration of no Dungeness but yet it was on special (as a mixed bag, not whole crab)...  

Will I go back, absolutely... But I plan to call ahead to make sure my crab is available as that's why I go often :-)"}
{"text":"Service, food and ambiance is always on point... 4 lbs of Dungeness crabs, 2 lbs of shrimp, 1 lb of claims, Cajun fries, noodles and sop it bread!!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time. I had the Dungeness crab. It was tasteless.  I didn't want to finish it. The only positive thing was the cheap beer prices. I will not be going back. Ghetto seafood."}
{"text":"With very few seafood restaurants in east Mesa, this place has been our go-to since it opened. We have had plenty of good experiences here however the past two visits have been less than satisfactory. Two visits ago we ordered everything with a medium spice, our clams were medium but our shrimp were much hotter.  When we asked our served about the difference he explained that \"It happens\" and said that he hears that a lot. Although the shrimp were really hot, we were incredibly hungry and didn't want to deal with sending them back for the correct spice, medium. Our visit on 4/19 was another disappointment...the raw oysters were not shucked very well, it took between 10-15 minutes to get a drink from the bar which was not busy, and several of the clams we received would not open. We gave the waitress the 7 unopened oysters back and when she brought the check, there was a $3 discount and we paid about a dollar per clam... Really hope this place gets their act back together!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, great beer menu, and excellent food! Can't wait to go back! Phoenix needed a place like this!"}
{"text":"Amazing cab! Stellar service. 

My wife and I have been fans of ACS since first trying the place in Phoenix. The style of cooking with the boiling bags filled with spices is superb. Messy as heck! But, so worth it.

We usually order the king crab and Dungeness, but have also had the snow crab. All have a different flavor that compliments well with the Trifecta sauce that we go with at 3-level heat. I usually have them throw in sausage for my bags, which gives an extra smoky flavor to the crab. The kids get the chicken fingers and the fried shrimp, then share. 

Service is pretty quick and I give them props for keeping drinks filled. It's a lost skill with service people these days.

We'll be back. Again. And again. Until our skin takes on the healthy red glow of our fave crustaceans..."}
{"text":"I had the lobster, king crab and shrimp. Boy oh boy, was it ever so delicious. The trifecta was a bit spicy for me and they totally went back and gave me another bag with no hot anything. I was truly impressed."}
{"text":"Crab here is the best I've ever had! I typically sit at the bar and service is always great. Definitely a must!"}
{"text":"Love everything here, the food atmosphere, you will never know who you will see eating there, it could be a sports personality. The brisket is amazing and everything.Owners are great."}
{"text":"Hello there Arizonians and snow birds.....

Been here 2 times and have nothing terrible to say.....

Nothing fantastic to say either !

Shrimp is good... since I enjoy the taste of seafood, I choose to not have any heat added....to me it takes away the taste of the food.

No reason to have to enhance good seafood!

The sweet potatoe fries  are good and the service both times was very good!

We had oysters which were terrible.... of course it was in the summer months and I am told months ending with \"R\" is the best time for oysters.

There were several of us and we all agreed on this.

Only suggestion is to get there early or you will wait....and wait....and wait.

Overall it was good and worth a try

This must be the shortest review I have ever written, but there was really nothing to boast about.

Give it a try....see what you think

and until then.............

Bon Appetite'"}
{"text":"This place was good! We did not get the crab legs kike everyone else in the restaurant. But I still enjoyed my shrimp platter. And the frog legs were delish. Yes, they tasted like chicken."}
{"text":"Food was generous, unfortunately the brisket and ribs were luke warm. Mac and cheese was dry and  not overly tasty. Cool concept and the Cajun Bloody Mary was great especially the crab leg. Service was very slow and not all that enthused. Maybe just an off day. Would be a good setting for a large group. Wasn't a bad experience just an underwhelming one."}

They have a vegetarian option which is boiled vegetables which were very good! I have an allergy to onion and garlic and they were very accommodating. Servers were upbeat and friendly and the atmosphere was pretty neat! You can write on the walls. Kid friendly as well. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Highly highly recommended. While it is messy, the flavors are amazing. My dad and sister in law suggested their trifecta sauce. Oh my goodness it was amazing. We had mussles, snow crab and the shrimp. All of them were cooked perfectly, tasted amazing and came out in a timely matter. 

Don't like seafood? They do have a selection of other meats. my 3yr old nephew loves his chicken strips and the fries were pretty damn good. 

It can be a little pricey, but he food is so delicious it is definitely worth the price. Try it!'"}
{"text":"Catfish and fries were very well seasoned. Price was a bit high. only one filet with fillers like coleslaw and fries cost $10 bucks.  Going back to try other food. .."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, outstanding service. The BEST gumbo I've ever had in my entire life. The seasonings and spice levels they have are terrific."}
{"text":"First time at Angry Crab on Ray Road. Fun!  Friendly! Finger licking awesome!  Sat at bar with mixologist Dawn. She immediately  welcomed us and built a relationship. She took the time to explain the menu and even helped me with my Bagged Trifecta King Crab. That is where the finger licking good comes in!  Delicious!  Everyone should experience this place."}
{"text":"First time here, and we loved it! Taylor was our waitress and she was SUPER helpful. Food is amazing, we had shrimp in a bag and a brisket sandwich. Everything was perfect! And at a great price! Highly recommend trying this place out!!"}
{"text":"Spicy and delicious seafood! Plan on getting dirty and full. Do not get spices in your eye though... That was my fault.

I hear that their BBQ is just as good but I have not had the chance to try it. For a date here plan on spending a minimum of $100.

Pros:
- The prices are great and reflect the current market. 
- Pretty much anything you get will be good. From king crab to crawfish.
- You pick the seasoning and level of spiciness you want of each dish.
- The food comes in a bag which throws you off a little at first but the taste and smell that come next trump the bag experience. 

Cons:
- None to mention. Been here a few times and the service and food are always great."}
{"text":"This was my first visit after about a year of wanting to try it out. It was very easy to find since it was really close to one of my favorite restaurants, Aloha kitchen. 
The hubby and I went on a Saturday around 430. There was about a 30 min wait but we passed the time at the bar with a drink or two. The smell from the restaurant was amazing. Growing up in Hawaii, I developed a love for seafood and I was so excited to finally have some crab legs and oysters. The hostess and waiters were very friendly and greeted us when we walked in and as we were seated. The waiter went over any questions we had with the menu and was very patient even though the place was very busy. I ordered a half dozen oysters and crab legs, and the hubby chose the calamari and shrimp basket. The food arrived faster than I expected which was great because I was starving! 
And boy, was it delicious! I tore into that crab and oysters so fast. My belly was very happy. The fries were seasoned just right along with everything else. The hubby enjoyed his food too and although he's not into \"raw\"seafood, he did try an oyster. It was hilarious. 
The angry crab gets 5 stars from me! I love the atmosphere, food,  and pricing. For all that we ordered plus drinks, we spent about $60 total. That's an A+ in the Eley book and we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Best seafood place in AZ hands down good flavors and good atmosphere always packed during normal busy hours but def worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great seafood and service. I visit the locations and Phoenix and Peoria and the food was worth the money."}
{"text":"This restuarant was nice from the decor to the staff. The amount of food was satisfactory for a meal and the selection of beer and other libations were normal to interesting. The wife and I was hoping it would be much better, to the temperature of the food to the quality of the food. You would expect the crab would be hot but only luke warm,  the barbeque to be warmer since freshly made. I was looking for a better experience"}
{"text":"The Angry Crab is a cool place to dine with friends and family or have a drink at the bar.
The selection of food choices is pretty good. There are a few barbeque choices to choose from as well as the seafood boils.
The boils are priced with a la carte items. You can purchase a pound of crab, shrimp, or a few other seafood choices. In order to complete the boil, you'd have to then purchase corn, potatoes and sausage a la carte adding them to your seafood.

I ordered 1 lb of shrimp to go, while I sat at the bar. The bartenders were fun. I had a most delicious peach martini served in a jelly jar. I almost hollered at the presentation, but the drink was really good. The bartender tasted it and was quite pleased with himself. Haha.

I ordered my shrimp in mild garlic sauce, as I don't care much for spicy food. The shrimp tasted bland, however, so I should have opted for a little spice to liven things up. There are several sauce options.
I didn't much care for having to dehead and shell the shrimp as the legs and eyes are still attached. I found that unappetizing, so I didn't eat many of them. The sausage, potatoes and corn were all good in the sauce.

The restaurant seats lots of people. There is a huge parking lot, however, its shared with several other businesses, so parking can be tricky.

I'd like to go again and dine in. No shrimp on the next trip."}
{"text":"Been here at least a dozen times, while the service has usually been poor, the food has always been good. But today the food was just terrible. My seafood was undercooked, and had a bitter taste.  And the service was even worse then usual. One server for the whole section. We waited,  and waited, and waited. I didn't even want to bother getting a new item. Manager didnt bother to come to my table and ask what was wrong.  Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Fun place to go with a group.  Service excellent.  Be prepared to wait but so worth it.  The portions were great.  Only downside they were out of Crab.  If you must have Crab call ahead and make sure they have it."}
{"text":"Wow. I absolutely loved this place. Wish I could go here for lunch and dinner, but I might get a few stares then. I highly recommend this place if you like seafood or Cajun food even a little.  I have not had such perfectly cooked crab ever. As far as spice I recommend the trifecta, but you should be warned that even a level 1 is spicy. They accidentally gave me a level one when I ordered a 2 (my own fault I kept changing things on my order), boy am I happy they made that mistake.  Level 1 was perfect. I can normally handle pretty spicy food but when it comes to seafood I learned that I like to enjoy the flavor without the spice level taking over. I ordered calamari which was really good and snow crab. The snow crab was amazing.  I will absolutely be back...probably later this week. :) Glad I found this gem."}
{"text":"Get there early or very!
Go with the rock and bib no utensils!
The lobster , trifecta with 2. It had my nose running like no other! 
Great place worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving such a high rating is because of our wait assistant Justin!  It was his first day and he was so attentive, smiling and enthusiastic!

Our server Tammy on the other hand was rude, eye rolling and we rarely saw her.  She just couldn't be bothered with us as she must have been trying to get out of there.  Sweeping was more important than drink refills or getting us some wet naps. (insert her eye roll here).

I wont be back to this location anytime soon!"}
{"text":"I came for the deep fried oysters. It is our first time here and I did not know their oysters are Cajun so Erik bought them with regular breading and they were Amazing!!!! Erik was so kind and very friendly. 
My husband ordered the catfish basket with the bbq beans he said good portions,  great Cajun flavoring and delicious.  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"First time to the Angry Crab.  The food is very good...spicy and flavorful.  Good portion size for the cost, so I consider it a good value.  Don't go if you want a quiet setting.  It is loud and vibrant.  I was a little taken back by that, but the food was worth the noise.  We will return when we get the itch to have some seafood.  The hush puppies are great."}
{"text":"Better than I had expected. Trifecta hot is the way to go. The shrimp are huge, the crawfish were great. Definitely load up on sausage. Also, the hush puppies were great"}
{"text":"King crabs  with lemon pepper and mild were delicious and so was the service!   8:30 pm is a perfect time to go on the weekend,  by then the 5 pm diners have left"}
{"text":"This spot has an amazing atmosphere.  Not your traditional restaurant, but more like a sports bar that has seafood!  I couldn't help myself to keep comparing this place to the hot n juicy on mill.  I haven't tried their bbq, I had the lb of shrimp with red potatoes and sausage and the food presentation is practically the same as hot n juicy (served by the lb in plastic bags) the only thing we didn't get that was redily available at hot n juicy was gloves. Didn't really think too much about asking for them because we were starving!! 

The specialty drink I ordered was called the ruby red, they used deep eddy vodka which I've never heard of but it tasted fantastic!

I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family. Kid friendly, and our server Ashley was extremely kind, observant and efficient."}
{"text":"Seafood was ok. Experience wasn't great.

After speaking with the manager about the unsatisfactory timing of food service we were told their protocol is to serve what is ordered by the pound as it finishes cooking. All-in-all, that makes sense. However, if wait staff aren't trained to take the time to \"time/pace out\" the order (as is procedure in more upscale dining) then they need to inform patrons of this in advance. Simply \"food is served as it finishes cooking and some items take longer than others\".

Let me paint a picture...man orders catfish and his date orders shrimp and crab by the pound. Man's catfish arrives within 5 minutes of ordering, meanwhile her shrimp arrives 20 minutes later and the crab another 5 minutes later. To be considerate, man waits to eat his meal until her's arrives. Well, that means his food is room temp at best. Or, the other option - man could simply be rude and eat his meal in front of her. That's a really, really poor approach to foodservice. Simply timing the catfish properly could have avoided it. And, certainly, it doesn't make for a great date/first impression. Just warning you in advance.

Regarding the food - the catfish was tasty, the shrimp were about 1 minute overcooked (too firm/rubbery) and the crab was good. The concept of choosing your custom sauce is fun, but the heavier flavors can take away from the delicate seafood flavor that many of us look for. What's more, everything starts to taste the same. Garlic/butter may be your best bet."}
{"text":"Had a lb of King Crab and ordered the medium spice and it made me sweat - which is just right for me!! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was my wife's birthday and several of her friends had recommended the Angry Crab Shack.  So I called to make a reservation, only to be told they don't accept reservations.  I was told to come before 6 PM to avoid much of a wait.

We arrived at 5:15 PM and had no trouble getting a table.  The food was good but there were several poor customer service issues that keep this from being a 5-star review.

1). They were out of most things and it was only 5:15 PM.  I'd hate to be ordering at 7 PM.  First my wife ordered the blue crab and the server came back and said they were out.  Then my wife ordered the dungeness crab and again the server came back to say they were out.  She also said they were out of clams.  So my wife, on her birthday was left to her 4th & 5th choices (crawfish and mussels) on her birthday.

2). As we were getting ready to leave around 6:30 PM, we noticed the table next to us being served clams.  Huh?  We were told an hour earlier that they were out of clams.

3). I found it very difficult to eat my lobster with just my fingers and a rock.  I asked our server and another server for some utensils to help get the lobster meat out and was both times told they only provide a rock for lobster.  Yet I saw people at other tables (who had ordered crab legs) with utensils and such.  The only utensil they would bring us was a plastic fork which was absolutely useless.  I don't understand when a customer wants a utensil why the server can't just bring it?

4). I have several small cuts on my fingers from eating the lobster with only the rock and my fingers.

The food was good.  The service was very poor.  We probably won't make much of an effort to return"}
{"text":"Great time at The Angry Crab tonight. Our server Natalie was absolutely amazing! She was friendly, knowledgeable, accommodating, and made a lasting impression on our group. There were about 15 of us and she spent time explaining and making a memorable experience for all of us. Thanks for the great dining experience tonight :)"}
{"text":"Worse seafood I've ever had. I'm from the Pacific NW and know good seafood and the Alaskan king crab was horrible. It was soggy and had a off taste to it. My husband's shrimp was bad too. We couldn't eat the meal. We will never eat here were again. I guess we will have to wait until we get back to WA to get good seafood."}
{"text":"Wow this has to be a two parter. 

1. The food is SO flavorful. I came with my mom and grandma last night and loved everything. We ordered the snow crab, the soft shell crab plate and the fried cod for granny (as she likes things a little more tame). Our server was not joking when he said everything runs a little on the hot side. I ordered the medium and I can usually handle my spice but this was HOT (but in a good way) 

2. The service and ambiance is really fun, it was a little loud for grandma, but definitely a place I'll come back with a group of friends and start crackin at some seafood. 

Also our server Jeff was awesome. Very attentive and seemed to be juggling a lot of tables... he even got some chuckles out of my non English speaking grandma... not an easy task my friend."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat seafood. There's no place like this unless you go to Vegas or LA. It's messy but so good. I have been here total of 6x ( so that speaks of the food ) and the first 2x we had a different server but honestly request Michele she will take care of you."}
{"text":"Yum! Had a great time! Good variety of beers and excellent service! Even when our waitress could not attend to us others were readily available! The trifecta shrimp was awesome!"}
{"text":"This place was so fun and the food was delicious!  There were five of us and we all shared a variety of things.  This was our first time here and our server, Cory, could not have been nicer or more helpful.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One day after a meeting my coworker and I stopped by this place to get lunch.  He said that this place is amazing, and he was right. 

The restaurant was clean, the staff was super friendly and attentive.  The staff was very helpful in helping us decide what to get.  The service was pretty quick, probably because at the time it was slow.  And the bathroom was decent.

We ordered pulled pork and a pound of shrimp, which was absolutely amazing.  Super delicious!! The soda was refreshing, and the lemon that we got with our water was perfectly sour.  Good quality place over here.  

Overall a good experience, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed Hot and Juicy at Westgate so when Angry Crab opened up, we were anxious to try it. Definitely a good choice. We were seated timely and the restaurant was very clean. Server greeted us quickly and was well versed about the menu, level of heat, etc. . The food came out hot and we really enjoyed our meal.  King crab legs were great at a medium spice level. The cayenne pepper was very noticeable at first but by the second or third bite you could really appreciate the crab. Tried the shrimp at a mild with the garlic and was pleased with that as well.  The hush puppies were a good appetizer and there were plenty of them in the order. I noticed someone gave them one star for no utensils and food coming in a bag. If you come here you need to understand the concept of how this food is served. You can't go to McDonald's and complain about the lack of steak so don't come here expecting an Ocean Club experience. If you like the Cajun style seafood and don't mind eating with your hands, this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"We started off with the aligator nuggets. Really like the flavor of the dipping sauce and my boy said that he like the flavor of the breading and the meat and that they were not overcooked on the inside. 

We really liked the Snow Crab  in trifecta sauce with level 3 heat with a side of #4. They yelled something to my suprise when they set the #4 down, so I picked it up and took a drink.. I guess it was a tradition they do there when someone orders the #4 or #5. It wasn't too hot for me, but then again I like it HOT!! We had corn, sausage and potatoes added to the bag. The corn was great, but  we would pass on ordering the sausage and potatoes as they didn't absorb all the flavor as the corn did. Order the potatoe salad instead. It was pretty good. My daughter ordered the Mac and Cheese. To me it was really good for \"Mac and Cheese\". It had a little spice to it. Maybe from some jalapeños? they add. 

We also ordered the triple meat platter with ribs, brisket and chicken and Jr. ordered the pulled pork sandwich. RUDY'S has them beat on the smoked meat, but we will be back for the steam bags of seafood. We would also recommend the charred oysters. 

From the looks of their old menu, they got rid of the Angry Orchard!!! Why? I was planning on ordering the \"Angry Balls\" from the old menu. I've tried other cider beers and they are just not my thing. Decided to stick to water today.

Great place to eat. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"service was awful...waiter was super friendly and apologetic...but we got our drinks...appetizers showed up 10 minutes. later...wife's main course showed up 10 minutes after that...my main course never arrived...waited 1 hour and asked 5 times...worst part is the appetizer was good and wife's main course was very good so i was really looking forward to my entree. Emailed the manager since they are fairly new and figured they need to know where the areas they need to improve...heard crickets....been over 2 months and never heard back from them...oh well, plenty of other restaurants in Phoenix

Update, the manager read our review, reached out, gave us a $25 gift card. we decided to try them again, what a turn around...food was excellent, loved the gumbo, wife loved the hush puppies...the pulled pork and chicken were good, the service though, exceptional this time...we will be back!"}
{"text":"so, the hostess was very nice, the waiter Nate did a great job...the food was really pretty decent...so why the 2 rating? 

Got there at 5:30....ordered drinks, they came within 5 minutes
 
placed our order wife got cod with potato salad and creole fries, i ordered some gumbo and pulled pork platter...we also got an edamame appetizer

15 minutes later wife's meal and edamame showed up...non of my food did

I asked Nate what the issue was and he said the kitchen was backed up. 

25 minutes later i said \"Nate, its not like they're cooking the gumbo special for me...its sitting in a pot...can you Go grab a bowl of it for me\"...5 minutes later he came back with the gumbo....

the table of six who came in 45 minutes after us got all of their food...the table of 8 that came in 60 minutes after us got all of their food

finally after asking 5 times where my order was i told Nate to cancel the rest of the order...this was at 7:00...1-1/2 hours after we got there 

very disappointing because the food was decent...the wait staff was very nice...we might try it again but not until after the poor taste of this experience is forgotten"}

{"text":"We came here to celebrate my husband's birthday, there were 7 in the party including 2 kids.  My son is a super finicky eater so he ordered the chicken strip basket and was happy; my daughter ordered the soft shell crab basket and liked it so much she ordered a second crab.  The adults all ordered the seafood by the pound.  The experience was fun, I enjoyed eating my food out of the bag.  All the seafood was good and the spices were very flavorful.  Our server was Eric and he was PHENOMENAL!  He was super attentive and very helpful, he definitely made our trip a good one!  I would definitely recommend this location to friends and we will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Very good seafood, the prices could be better. I feel like Joe's Crab shack is more affordable and they sell the same kind of food."}
{"text":"The only issue I have with this place is the wait. It can be a 45 min wait just to get a table. But it's worth the wait. Food here are great. And the people are nice. Had not written my name on the wall yet. But I will one day."}
{"text":"Good seafood places can be hard to come by in Arizona.  But, you would not know that by going to Angry Crab!  You want seafood and I mean REALLY good seafood the exact way you like it...go to Angry Crab.

This place will fulfill your fantasy for seafood. Crabtastic!"}
{"text":"Decided to skip the Independence Day BBQ and opt for seafood instead...I know, I'm weird!

Location & Aesthetics - of the two locations that I know of, I chose to go to the one on South Alma School Road.  
The restaurant wasn't difficult to spot from South Alma School Road.  Lots of parking available. 
The outside had the usual seating for dinning with misters but we decided against sitting outside as there was some kind of private BBQ party as there were folks using a grill (not sure if that was theirs or the restaurant's).
The interior was roomy, a bit on the noisy side, clean and well lit. 
We were immediately greeted as we entered and seated at once. 
What's interesting is that all the tables are all covered with butcher paper which serves as your plates (you eat on said butcher paper).  The only condiment on the table, in addition to the napkins, was ketchup.  Apparently there's no utensils as you eat with your hands.

Menus - the place serves alcoholic drinks (mixed drinks & a variety of beers).  
The menu was easy to understand.  You can order your food by the pound which is usually what everyone does, or order a plate of something.
When ordering your shrimp, crab legs, crawfish, or whatever it is, just remember you must order a pound of it and up...no 1/2 pound, 1/4 pound etc. 

Service - staff was attentive, friendly, and checked in on us frequently. 

Food - I had a pound of shrimp with the trifecta sauce, made mildly spicy, corn on the cob, and 4 slices of sausage.  This concoction comes in a bag as if everything is lobbed int there, shaken violently, and served to you.  
The shrimp was fresh and tasty especially with the sauces and spices.  The same can be said for the corn on the cob, however the sausage wasn't anything special and tasted like a regular Italian sausage. 
In addition to the above, I also had a pound of the crawfish with the trifecta sauce and no spice, and I have to say it tasted really bland (-1) and had a briny taste to it (not sure if it's me or if that's the way it's supposed to taste).
Another minus for me is the lack of condiments/dipping sauces offered on the table or with the meal.  In my opinion, the option to have extra sauces to dip one's crawfish, shrimp, etc. should be made available because I may not necessarily want to commit to the particular sauces I ordered with my meal when I placed the order.

I think this place is worth another trip back to it to try their lobster, crab legs, and maybe, if I'm brave enough, their frog legs!"}
{"text":"Really fun place! It was our first time, and our server was very informative and helpful. We ended up getting the trifecta shrimp and king crab legs, and it was soooooo good. I could not stop eating the fries. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Finally a place that makes amazing hot and spicy Cajun seafood! The BBQ is pretty solid too. Be prepared to get messy and if you don't like heat we'll remember to tell them... or just go to Red Lobster or something. Oh and the service is outstanding!"}
{"text":"My kind of food here - seafood steamed/boiled in spicy seasonings with an option for barbecue. This is one of those places where the bigger the group of people the better the value. You order by the pound, you share, and everyone gets messy together.

I brought a friend from back East and we both grew up on seafood from the Chesapeake Bay. We were looking forward to blue crabs but they were out. From the remaining seafood choices - and we decided to stick with seafood instead of barbecue - we chose shrimp, crawfish, and king crab legs. Trifecta sauce, mild heat because our server, Dion, said that things run on the spicy side.

So, it's entirely possible that ordering Alaskan King crab legs at the angry crabshack and barbecue is a bit of a reach. I didn't care because I have to try them, right?

I wasn't disappointed in them, however, roasted and then split and served with drawn butter is just the best way to eat Alaskan King crab legs and now I know. Everything was delicious just the same and cooked just right. Nothin worse than rubbery overcooked skrimps and there was none of that here. 

I couldn't pass up the sausage four-piece and I'm glad that I tried it because it is excellent. For me it was the most memorable part of the entire meal and I will be going back soon for more. I've got to try the barbecue as well. Whoever runs the smoker seems to know what they're doing with wood and low heat."}
{"text":"My very first time...I've waited to find the right partner to venture this.  I have several friends that have went and said that it was amazing....
My 9 year old grandson was my date.  He tried crab a few years ago at Red Lobster and liked it...Kids change though.
It is a Sunday around 5pm...it was getting busy.  we waited for a booth.  Hostess was really cool, and let us know a few times what table was about to depart.  Loved the communication.
My grandson got the kids chicken tenders (why? will be the next question)  I ordered the snow crab, potato salad, hush puppies,. angry edamame and bread for sopping.
All only a dollar each.

This crab was without a doubt the best I've ever had!!!  I got the garlic and butter with a heat level of 2.  It was incredible.  It is an experience, as you are invited to be messy.  (i'm usually a very neat eater)

The reason I gave only 4 stars, (and it really isn't a big deal) is that whatever it is you order, it comes out as it is done.  For example, I ordered the crab, grandson ordered the kids chicken strips, I ordered the potatoe salad (very good), edamame, hush puppies, bread for sopping...and it came out in this order.  1)potatoe salad 2) crab 3) hush puppies 4) bread 5) chicken strips 6) edamame

So bring a dose of patience and experience the experience...Really good food, and can not wait to go back!!  Everyone was very friendly...and also it is clear that they do big stuff for birthdays."}
{"text":"Never been to an angry crab before but they really aren't family friendly with 3 choices on the kids menu 2 of them being fish so that leaves 1 choice chicken tenders which my kids didn't like, if you have kids that eat fish your good to go, blue crab and crawfish outta season, dang, got shrimp and mussels, shrimp were awesome mussels were a complete joke, the mussels had barely anything in them half of ours were empty, told the waiter he didn't care, considering mussels are super cheap that's where this rating comes in plus kid unfriendliness and your gonna walk out paying about the same or more thsuishi check, will return without my kids someday when blue crab is back"}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and is perfect for a big group. Casual enough we brought our young kids and they had a blast cracking the crab and eating with their hands. Good selection and very fresh."}
{"text":"One word....AMAZING! Yes most of the food is pricey but the food there is sooo good. One sad thing is they took away the monday special which included king crab legs/ mussles/ shrimp. other than that YUM!"}
{"text":"Came in with a party of 5 and we split most of the appetizers and several of the entrees.  Everything was excellent and we had great service. Will come again for sure."}
{"text":"Flavors are amazing, service is always great. A must try, you'll be addicted."}
{"text":"Holy cow! Delicious food and we had one of the most amazing servers EVER. Jeff M. was super friendly, helpful and taught us a few tricks on how to gnaw down on crab the easy way. Genuinely would come back solely on  our server. The food was amazing as usual, but holy cow Jeff deserves a raise!"}
{"text":"Really good food and extremely fast service. For fresh market fish, the prices were great. I would definitely recommend this place for great seafood"}
{"text":"Love this place! Laid back atmosphere with fresh seafood and great Cajun fries! My fiancé and I really loving going there and diving into a dozen shrimp and crab legs. Absolutely would recommend!!"}
{"text":"We have gone to the Alma School location for a couple years so we were so excited to hear that the one in Mesa opened up. We went on a Friday night after 7:30 and only had to wait about 20 minutes.  We ordered our usual snow crab legs and shrimp trifecta 2. It was so delicious. Our server was great and let us know that soon they will be open for lunch. As an appetizer we always get the fried shrimp basket with cajun fries. And it was awesome as well. I have tried other fried dishes at the other location and wasn't impressed but the shrimp is yummy. Fun place to go, will definitely return!"}

Great atmosphere , playing good mix of music, service was fast and friendly. The angry wings are out of this world. Went to wingstock in Gilbert and these wings would easily compete maybe win. Shrimp po boy was great and we'll priced. Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"Amazing and so delicious!! Decor is cool! 
Diana was great , explaining everything to us. Food was absolutely fantastic. We had Oysters and the King Crab trifecta. We will be back and tell all our friends about Angry Crab! Thanks Andy and Dave ( The Rooster)."}
{"text":"For what it is, it's delicious and fun.  If you like crab by the pound with paper covered tables, craft beer and a fun atmosphere then this is your spot.  I had King Crab with a hot n spicy butter, boiled sausage and red potatoes, cold beer and great service.  I shall return!"}
{"text":"Love, Love LOVE this place!  We met friends there for the Cardinal vs Seahawks game for the first time and came back on Christmas eve!  The King Crab is amazing as well as the Lobster! The trifecta sauce really is good.  I went for the mild spice and it does have some kick.  Goes down great with a Four Peaks Kiltlifter.  This is 'get in and get messy' eating at it's finest!  They even gave their best shot at duplicating a Sugar Plum Martini for me!  A favorite place for sure!  The BBQ is great, too!  It can be as inexpensive as the BBQ or as spendy as the Lobster."}
{"text":"First time here! We had the snow crab and shrimp. (Trifecta medium). The food and service were both great. Lauren was our server and she was awesome. She explained everything and got us off to a great start. The gloves and bib are crucial. Wear them."}
{"text":"Im originally from Washington I know my seafood. I did not have seafood here. Im not entirely sure what it was. Fish was for sure frozen 2 min before they cooked it. the crab tasted like krab. Service was good."}
{"text":"Love! If my husband and I ever get a date night, this is where we go. We love the medium Kajun trifecta snow crab with a couple beers. Heaven!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I really enjoy spicy foods but let me warn you anything hotter than medium is almost not enjoyable. I'm a MexiCAN so take my word lol! My only gripe (okay two gripes)

1. You can't get half orders. You can only order by the pound and sometimes I want variety so that's kind of a bummer. If you have a husband, make him order the other option you want. Problem solved. 

2. Dam it I can't remember my second issue so I guess it really wasn't that bad.

Anyway the food and service is great!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend the trifica sauce with any heat of your choice. I came here for my birthday with my husband ordered the pound of lobster,crab and shrimp two potatoes and a corn cob, one alcoholic drink that tasted like it came from a pre-made store bottle called the \"hurricane\". Didn't care for it. And a normal iced tea will set you back at around 80 dollars. The only thing i recommend from here is the crab with trifica sauce and potatoes. When we ordered the lobster i really wish our server would have told us about all the green gunk that came with the lobster very off putting and grossed us out. He also did not honor the happy hour price for my drink even though i asked about it. (Still in the time frame) the lemon pepper sauce didn't taste like anything it tasted like normal water boiled shrimp. The no utensil thing is interesting to say the least they give you scissors a crab cracker and a rock. I would recommend the business to at least give those tiny scented wipes packets even after washing your hands well, you will still smell like seafood. Would i come back most likely not maybe just to pick up a pound or two of crab."}
{"text":"Good. Messy!  

Service was ok. 

We had lobster and shrimp. All served by the pound.  Comes in a bag. They offer various seasoning choices. Kind of reminded me of going to an outdoor party on the coast smashing fresh cooked lobster and crabs. Yup. No plates. One cracker,  bucket for shells,  napkins,  paper cups for your drinks (bummer), plastic spoons (bummer) for the side of rice we ordered (again no plates). Served simply!  Served cheaply!  The shrimp was cooked beautifully. The whole lobster seemed to need another 2 minutes for cooking, but rather that than over. (I enjoyed it). Oh and the rice...was nice!  

This is a good option. Walking in reminded me of Crab Shack in some respects. But definitely not like Joe's Crab Shack. Tastes better. Tastes fresher. More flavor options."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! I have been to this place a number of times and I've fallen in love with their crabs, shrimps, veggies, corns and sangria! Amazing taste and if you are a hot & spicy lover, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing. You walk in and can immediately feel the great energy in both the people who work there and with the customers. My friend and I didn't get the huge bag-o-awesome they have, but we were extremely impressed at how well they seem to cook and season everything. I went with the brisket and nearly cried as I took the first bite. It simply melted in my mouth. And the taste? Forget about it. I could have been on fire and not noticed because of how delicious it was. Hopefully I'll be hungry enough next time to get a whole crab or lobster, but for about $25 per person, including a custom coctail and a local beer you won't find a better place to hand over your well earned greenbacks. Will be going back at least once every week or so."}
{"text":"I just am not a fan of eating with my fingers. With that being said, the flavor of the food here is delightful.  You also get to wear a lovely plastic bib. I advise you to wear it unless you don't care about the clothes you are wearing.

I had the mussels with corn, trifecta sauce and a heat reading of 3 on the burn you to death meter. I think I could have gone to a 4 because I didn't think the food was very spicy after the first bite.  If you order a spiciness of 5 or 6, you will be blasted with a fog horn when your food is served. That way everybody knows that there is a crazy person in the restaurant who wants to BURN.

They have a very acceptable list of beers on tap as well as a full bar. 

Do they have dessert? Probably, but most people will be so full after their main course they will skip dessert.

Definitely the owners have figured out a way to make food eating fun and to make their customers extremely happy."}
{"text":"The food is awesome... service is hit or miss, though it is a true team effort!! The place can be so loud it distracts from being able to enjoy your meal. 2nd time here and it went from good to eh."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of hype about this place so I thought I'd check it out. The set up is interesting. I've been to crab places before where they brought you a bucket of food and dumped it on the table for you to eat but generally they offer utensils as well. Angry Crab gives you a fist-sized rock and some scissors. I did ask for silverware and got some plastic forks and knives but they're relatively useless for anything. They do tell you up front that you eat with your hands but sticking a potato or a piece of sausage in your mouth by hand is a little funky. Might just be me. 

I tried a lot of food as we all ordered something different so we could sample several things. The dungeness crab, lobster, king crab and shrimp were all very good. By themselves they're all worth going to Angry Crab for. The potatoes were pretty good, though it's a potato so it's hard to get a bad one. The sausage, which I'm generally a fan of, tasted the way fireworks smell. I'm not sure what the deal with that is but it reminded me of sulfur and the last time I dined with Satan in Hell. The bread was also pretty meh. The clams and calamari are just bad. I don't know if I've ever left calamari on the table before, but these tasted like fish sticks. 

So my advice is go for the crab, lobster and shrimp and you'll have great food and if you love smashing your food with a rock, you'll have an even better time. Just watch your fingers. 

Lastly, we interacted with probably 5 different staff members and every one of them was extremely pleasant and helpful. Very, very nice people and they were quick on bringing out food and drinks and helping to keep the table from being too much of a disaster while we caveman'd our food."}
{"text":"This is our second time at this restaurant & seafood is great.  We enjoyed it so much the first time we brought our kids today.  Our server Suzette was so nice and pleasant, all of the staff was helpful.  We ordered crawfish and did not know how to eat it so one of the staff showed us the proper way to do it.  My son who hates anything that is not a chicken nugget loved the fried calamari and the snow crab legs.  My daughter loved everything and really enjoyed the crawfish.  I recommend this place to everyone.  The atmosphere is fun and easy going.  My kids can't wait to go back for more!!!"}
{"text":"10/10 stars, shout out to our waiter SEAN! He was the best! It's been a long time since we have received such genuine sincere top notch service! The food and atmosphere was very welcoming and relaxing. The music was great. Will return and ask for Sean!! LOVE ANGRY CRAB"}
{"text":"Loved this place!!! Get ready to get down and dirty and eat some Grub!! The bartenders were very knowledgeable and fun Larry and Richard! Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Food and service was good.   My big complaint is that they charge for melted butter.  We spend $60 on 2  pound of crab and they can't throw in the butter??!?!


Still scratching my head."}
{"text":"Come on Mondays. The staff is knowledgable and great. This is a wonderful addition to the block. Support it often. 
The shrimp should not be missed. Enjoy. 
And the curry pacific rim is 2nd to none. Hot and juicy is easily beat right here"}
{"text":"This place is for real. It features the flavors, sounds, and beer of Louisiana.  We had the traditional shrimp and catfish boils. Catfish was amazingly light and fluffy. The shrimp is large and served whole. The flavor element and heat are on point. The service is better than expected for a recently opened restaurant."}
{"text":"I used to go to a place in Southern CA called Killer Shrimp, which serves a delicious spicy shrimp in broth. I missed it a ton when I moved to AZ - but not any more. 
The Angry Crab comes as close as you can get and maybe is even better!  I had the shrimp in mild (not really) Trifecta sauce and it was delicious. 
Very casual, very messy and very good.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Man! This place was the bomb. The trifecta sauce is delicious and the onion rings were perfect!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"First time here, lunch hour on a Saturday. If you like cajun food such as shrimp boil then this is the place. I had their catfish basket and it was delicious. Atmosphere, price, menu. What's there not to like!"}
{"text":"We've  been wanting to try this place. Went on Sunday, got there about 3:45, had about 25 min wait. Got our text and was shown to our table. It is covered with big sheet of butcher paper. We used to go to another restaurant that did this but gave crayons to draw with. Anyway, our waitress, Tami, was great and explained everything  to these beginners. They have crab, lobster, frog legs, mussels, clams, alligator, shrimp too. We ordered a lb of snow crab each, one in garlic and one in lemon pepper seasoning. We got potatoes salad and Cole slaw to share and melted butter. Donned our bibs and away we went. This was the best, getting messy, buttery, and all the delicious and delectable crab. Tami kept making sure we were OK in our quest. I wouldn't  dress up for this place and wouldn't  recommend for prom. Slaw and potatoes salad were good but without salt and pepper. No sugar  or sweet n low on table but they will bring it. This was out of our comfort zone but we really had a great meal and lots of fun once we just dug  in."}
{"text":"OMG this place is amazing!

Get the trifecta three with crab and shrimp. Be sure to get extra bread and just get down on that food! It is soooo good, the service is good, the price is so reasonable for fresh seafood, and you will leave craving it again and again.

I'm so glad this place opened right by my house!!"}
{"text":"Get down and dirty. Unconventional but delicious. Butcher paper table covers. After you decide what you want, you pick your seasoning and heat level. Your meal is prepared in individual plastic bags, and served as soon as they are ready. No plates. A bib is offered (take it). Other than sides, the main entree is served in the bag. This can be messy but well worth it. My favorite is the king crab. Everything is delicious, but especially noteworthy is the Calimarie (best I've ever had). Not the regular circles; these are approx 5\" long strips, tender and perfectly cooked. Also good are the Alligator Bites (it really does taste like chicken, with a slightly different texture). Well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Great place to eat with family and friends yummy seafood and bbq good service!!! Friendly employee!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the fried cod basket (comes with cajun fries), mac and cheese, and gumbo.  Cornbread came with it too.  

The gumbo was very good.  The mac and cheese was also very good although somehow different from your garden variety mac and cheese.  I don't think there was something else in it, but rather how it was prepared?  I'm not really certain.  I would get it again though.  The cornbread was the best I've had; I scored some extra to take home.  

I was disappointed in the size of the pieces of cod that came with the cod basket.  Maybe my expectations were ill focused but I was looking for something more the lines of a breaded fish fillet and these were more like slightly oversized fish sticks.  The cajun fries were good but the seasoning overpowered everything around it, both in terms of aroma and flavor."}
{"text":"I had heard about this spot and was dying to try it out! This weekend finally presented the perfect opportunity to visit the Mesa location as we found ourselves a bit more East in the valley than we are usually.

Walking in at 2:30 on a Saturday afternoon, we were surprised to find just about every table in the main dining room full - ranging from large groups celebrating birthdays to families to couples.. and just about everything in between. As the old adage goes, all these people can't be wrong when it comes to food.

Our waiter, Brandon, did a fantastic job explaining the menu to us.. noting that the seafood comes as pictured on the menu (aka you have to dismantle the food yourself) and explaining the different sauces and spice levels. Within about 15-20 minutes, our bags of crab and shrimp arrived steaming hot and seeped in the Trifecta sauce (a blend of garlic, ole bay, and paprika I think?) which was absolutely heavenly. Though it would've been easier to disarm the crab using a mallet, we made it work with the seafood scissors.

We wrapped up the meal with Hurricanes to drink.. my first ever! For not being a fan of sweet tasting alcohol, it was pretty good (and had a kick too!)

Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"When I'm craving my snow crab legs this is my go to place. I usually get the trifecta sauce and I have tried both the level 2 and 3 (out of 5). Not going to lie, I like my spicy but level 3 was hot and like they said, there were times I could not feel my lips...but it still did not stop me for finishing my pound of snow crab legs . Nothing could stop me, I ate those legs up. 

I usually go by myself but I can see the perks to going with a group. Umm, more things to add to your bag and try. 

The service is pretty decent so not much complaints from me. I don't ask for much, serve me my crab legs, give me my drink. Let me eat in peace  and refill my drinks when I'm low. 

All in all, if you love seafood, it's a must try. Load your bag up with all the extra goodies to really appreciate the sauce. My favorites are the red potatoes, corn and sausage."}
{"text":"I haven't been blue crab picking since I moved out here from the east coast 2 years ago.  I heard about this place from some friends that work at Rehab Burger Therapy in Scottsdale and knew I had to check it out.  It does not disappoint.  

The Atmosphere: Very relaxed with it's open layout and they'll even let you write your name on the wall.  Paper is on the table for a reason, be ready to get messy.

Service:  Being that it was my first time there, I asked the bartender how it all works and for suggestions.  He was very helpful and got me all set up with some of the best seafood I've had in AZ.  I wish I could remember his name so I could give him a shout out on here.  But if you sit at the bar and your service is awesome, your beer cold and always full, and he cracks some hilarious jokes ... that's him.

Food:  Again, I cannot stress enough how badly you need to visit this place if you enjoy picking crabs, lobster, crawfish, or anything else you can throw in to a boil.  My bartender suggested what flavors to start with for each of my orders; but, hands down the trifecta is the way to go.  It had the perfect amount of spice that complimented the seafood and I ended up dipping everything in it.  I ended up getting a pound of blue crab, a pound of clams, and a pound of shrimp.  Everything was amazing, the shrimp were HUGE, and I definitely made a huge mess in the process.  

If you've made it this far through this review and aren't convinced, go ... go now.  You will not be disappointed and I promise you will be back.  God knows I will.  Thank you Angry Crab!"}

The place was freaking great
We loved the seafood 
And we cleaned the freaking plate 

Sing it like a rhyme 
Sing it like a song 
Holy crap Angry Crab 
We've been here way too long

We'll be here again and again"}
{"text":"love the service, love the food, love that they drop a little knowledge on you as well.  beer selection is pretty decent, as is the atmosphere.  One of my favorite places to eat - it's interactive and fun!  Reasonably priced, as well."}
{"text":"This is a relaxed place to eat, first time here.
Our waitress was nice and friendly, overall
We like the food little bit of a mess
We had blue crab, fired oysters,
Fried calamari. We love the calamari
Not so much the oysters, blue crab was good although one was completely dry."}
{"text":"This place has a good atmosphere, delicious seafood, awesome sauces, and good appetizers/menu options. Try the trifecta sauce if you get any seafood, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Got my seafood fix! I ordered the trifecta hot, it was everything I expected. The sauce tasted amazing and the spice was the perfect amount. 

A pound of shrimp was a bit much for me but I had to finish it.

1/2 of of shrimp would be perfect. Wish they had that on the menu."}
{"text":"The trifecta hot for the sauce is spicy and tasty for you spicy lovers!

I tried the angry ghost sauce before and it was good before I couldn't enjoy my food because it was so spicy I could barely feel my mouth. And I can handle spicy like Thai peppers and what not.

The sauce has lots of flavors that will leave you stomach happy.

The location is a little hard to find because it is in the corner, but it is in the complex where the Fry's food is."}
{"text":"My new favorite place in town.

If you like the following this is the place for you:

Seafood
Butter
Flavors
SPICE!


Quite simply put, this is a great experience and a great little restaurant.

Definitely get the Shrimp, potatoes and Sausage! Plus whatever other seafood you might like

This place is THE BOMB"}
{"text":"Always awesome. Not quite as good as the MEsa location but it's AWESOME!

Try the Softshelled Crab basket and get a boil with #3 flavor and shrimp, sausage and potatoes!!!

awesome awesome."}
{"text":"Your typical Cajun seafood in a bag restaurant. 

This is Arizona's closest version of a restaurant that's pretty well known in other states (cough Boiling Crab). But I'm not going to complain because this joint is actually pretty good itself too. 

You order your seafood by the pound based on market price. It comes in a bag with the flavor and spice level of your choice. Or you can get one of their fried baskets which I have yet to try. Only complaint I have is, I wish they gave more sauce in each bag; the saucier, the more flavor, the better. My server was ABOVE&BEYOND amazing. She was attentive, helpful, cheerful, and recommended the most amazing food to make our experience better. 

Recommendations: 
- sauce: trinity 
- Cajun fries 
- bread for soopin: dip the bread into the bag of sauce! So yummy! 

Tips: 
- if you go when the restaurant opens you may have the option of ordering one of their premade bags. It's from their leftover seafood from yesterday but it's a good deal and the seafood still tastes good! $20 bought us a 2lb bag of muscles, snow crab, shrimp, and veggies. If you want a little bit of everything, this is the way to go! 

Atmosphere: 5/5
Food: 4/5
Price: 4/5
Service: 5/5"}
{"text":"I normally frequent the mesa location but we decided to try the phoenix location yesterday. I have to say, as much as we love the mesa location, I think that we will be going to the phoenix store more often! Our server was Jeff and he was absolutely amazing!! By far the best angry crabs server we have ever had!! He was so attentive and kind and he made sure we had ever
ything we needed at all times. The food was amazing, as always.. But it tastes even better when you receive service as great as the service Jeff gave us. I highly recommend this location! We will be back soon :)"}
{"text":"I'd been to a couple of these \"seafood boil\" places before -- Boiling Crab in California, Hot and Juicy nearby in Tempe -- so the concept wasn't new to me. Regardless, I was so excited to try out this new(er) central Phoenix spot. 

A few things:
The service? Incredible. Emilie was our server and wow, we have been to a ton of restaurants with our kiddo over the past few years, and no server was as kind and interactive as Emilie. 

The atmosphere? Very similar to others of this type of restaurant. Butcher sheet table coverings, writing all over the walls (by guests), very casual attire w/ plastic bibs provided. 

The food? We ordered a pound of shrimp at $12 a pound that day, and a fried shrimp kids meal for our child (kids meals are $5 and come with a side and a drink), plus corn ($1 each) and potatoes (50 cents each). 

Kids meal came out first. We had to temperature check so we got to try the fries and a small piece of shrimp. Hot but soooo good. We contemplated getting our own fries because they were that good. 

Our pound of shrimp came out next, with corn and potato in the bag. With these places you need to peel & devein the food yourself. So, it's a little effort. A pound wasn't enough but we didn't feel like spending another $12 on maybe 12 pieces of shrimp. 

The trifecta sauce IS amazing but it tasted like absolutely nothing but the beginning. You need to let your food sit in the bag for a while, like maybe another 5-10 minutes or so, to let the full flavor blend into the food - kind of like letting chili simmer. I wish they'd done that before serving it to us, because by the time I was on my last piece of shrimp I finally got the full flavor. Luckily, I still had some corn and potato left. 

Anyway overall, I'll come back to this place when I'm willing to spend a little more, because it IS very flavorful and I'm glad a place like this has come to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Fresh seafood in a casual setting! I've never had a bad experience, always a fun place to visit and bring people who have never been! Very good prices for what you get! Crab legs and shrimp my fave!!!!!!!! Gets messy but they will provide bibs and gloves!"}
{"text":"Fan of the mesa location so tried this one expecting not as long of a wait... 1st time was packed n waited about 40 min, not too bad, been back 3 more times... tells ya something right there alone. 

This place has excellent BBQ / I would rather come here than Famous Daves, ok... Wife always gets the combo Ribs n Oysters, which are great, they offer a couple different sauces for the ribs, and I enjoyed both, tho they sometimes charge you for the extra sauce... Act like you dont know which is which n \"sample\" both, then usually left off the bill... 

Heat meter warning..... 1-5 from the Mesa location does not hold the same scale-ability here as each time I ordered, it came out a lil over my expectation. Usually in Mesa I get 3, n this places 3 was a tad too hot both time, as thought 1 time might be an error, then last time we went a couple weeks ago, I got the 2, and it was still pretty hot... 

My fave is 1lb Shrimp, Trifecta 3-mesa  / Trifecta -1 here next time maybe... 
Kids love the mussels, garlic flavor No heat
Wife , Ribs n oyster Combo

Now the best part of this place is the price. For a pound of Raw shrimp in the store, your looking at 10-12bucks per pound... same price as this place hooked up with sauce, n no cleanup. :-) 

See you there on our next seafood craving...
Almost n extra * for having 4 peaks on tap,,,"}
{"text":"Made our 2nd trip here, and even as busy as they were, our food came out in a timely manner. 

Shrimp - Trifecta 3 - Delicious / added Sausage
Mussels - Garlic sauce 1 - Ok, but think the Clams are better
Snow Crab - Garlic Sauce 3 - Pretty good / little pricy (store 8.99) 15 here.

Kilt Lifter on TAP !! Awesome. 
Brought the kids n they loved eating off the table... 

The only flaw I noticed was some customers walk in and aren't necessarily greeted right away, while multiple employees walked by. ALL employees should take a sec just to ask, have been helped yet, or some greeting. The Staff seemed like most was their first time Waiter/ress-ing. We had to literally flag them down when we needed something. Attentiveness needs to be trained.

Solid place so far, hope their staffing steps it up,, They are always busy, so the tips are flowing, now they need to earn it."}
{"text":"My Fave Seafood place in the East Valley opening their doors Friday Nov 4th.

They will also have BBQ like the Ahwatukee and Glendale Locations !!!

Shrimp / PAcific Rim style, with #2 Heat is the goto... They also changed up their fried Shrimp to a more tastier popcorn style shrimp  ,, great for kids,,,,"}
{"text":"We ate here for mother's day. Food was great. Service was awesome. Barb was great.  They were very busy but very attentive. We will be back for sure. We would recommend to everyone to eat here."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food was awesome--blows Joe's Crab Shack out of the water! The crawfish and mussels with the trifecta spicy were perfect. Only downfall is that the kids menu isn't that strong. Regardless, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"From Houston...love our crawfish...here for the Arizona renfest...so thought we would find us some. Never again!lol! Something you just don't get outside of Houston...the crawfish is one. Ordered the butter based one...6 pound (at 13 bucks a pound WTF?) came out in a bag...thought...hhmmm...maybe. Nope NOPE NNNNOOOPPPEE! Dry rubber crawfish. So got some butter to dip in thinking that would help...nope...did not. So sad...specially for 13 a pound. 4-5 a pound in Houston...and do even the worst crawfish we ate there was 10x better than this. Uhg!!"}
{"text":"Our group of 6 went on 11/26. Unlike D.L., my hubby had a fab lobster...and he's picky about them. His lob was perfectly cooked. We all enjoyed our king crab, oysters, fish orders. Seasonings were good; we ordered mild and it still had a little kick. We all agree the Cajun fries are spot on; sweet potato fries really good, too. We did tell owner Ron that they need to change up the corn muffins -- more like mini muffs. 

They will only get better with time. Staff does need more training, and hopefully they'll take criticism of kitchen timing to heart. Ron is such a great guy, have to give them 4 stars and wish them the best!"}
{"text":"The food is always delicious. We come here for all of our special occasions. Tonight was 14th wedding anniversary and the service was awful! Our waitress, Maria, didn't talk to us once. The bus boys had to finally ask us if we needed another drink. She knew we asked the bartender for another drink so decIded to ignore us. We are really excited that our marriage has lasted this long. Too bad the restaurant never rang the bell for our anniversary. So disappointed and definitely will think twice before coming here again. I was so upset that she ignored us that I didn't enjoy my dinner with the love of my life. Truly disappointed. Too bad. Have to find a new location for our special occasions. We were so excited that we had a place close to home to go to. Oh well! Life is full of disappointments! Thanks Angry Crab for a horrible dining experience."}
{"text":"One star because this wouldn't let me give no stars.  I have been twice now and both times I have left wondering what the 'frenzy' about this place is all about.  The first time I had the crab legs (24.00 a pound) and after getting TWO crab legs, I figured this place was just about the profit margin and not the positive experience.  BUT, I figured give it another chance.


This last time I went and decided on the fried shrimp basket and calamari with a cob of corn on the side.  My mother chose the raw oysters on the half shell.  

When hers arrived... they were frozen. Yep.  Like a block of ice.  All 12 of them.  We asked the server if the oysters come fresh and he was honest and said, \"I don't know how the food is prepared here.\"  Yea.  He said that.  So, we sent back the oysters, got another platter which they obviously microwaved because they came out hot and she stated not too fresh tasting.  They had a musty fish taste and odor.

Then, my fried shrimp.  I bit into one and well, raw shrimp inside.  So, I tried another, raw.  I sent them back and and the server brought me another basket.  This time, I peeled the breading off and yep, raw.  RAW SHRIMP.  I just didn't eat it.  The server took the basket back and I saw the manager tell him, \"That is not raw.  She's crazy.\"  Hmm.... when shrimp is clear inside and cold, to me that is raw.

The calamari was NOT FRESH.  It had a taste of tunafish.  

I realize we are in Arizona and there are no oceans nearby ..... but other restaurants in town serve fresh seafood and for the prices you will spend at Angry Crab, I would assume they could afford FedEx fees.

Twice was enough for me."}
{"text":"Not enough meat for the price. You only get 1 lbs which is not really a lot and you have to pay extra for other stuff to go with it. Plus I asked for no spice and they brought me out a really spicy bag. They said it was because I didn't say \"no base\" apparently they use old bay seasoning and something else spicy for their base. It was my first time there so when I ordered a butter garlic flavor I thought it would be boiled in water with just the garlic butter flavor.. the server told me it wouldn't be spicy.. yea I had to send mine back and the manager that came over made me feel like it was my fault that I didn't say \"no base\" but seriously it was my first time ever here. Not worth the money and the waitress didn't listen when I told her I had a spice sensitivity"}
{"text":"Place was awesome !! Customer service was the best the manger kat personally talked to us at least 3 times made sure everything was great asked about the taste of the food .. etc lisa our main waiter was great and spot on .. FYI food taste great just go! Ok back to the World Series"}
{"text":"I ate at the Guadalupe location and the food is so freakin awesome.

I had the shrimp with sausage and corn and my wife had the muscles.

Prices were reasonably and the food was so good.
I only recommend being cautious when ordering the spicier option.
I think I got the second hottest option for my shrimp bag and it was way too spicy for me, and I can handle spicy.

I look forward to trying the east Mesa location"}
{"text":"One of the best places in Arizona for seafood! The king crab boil is amazing! The service is great and the atmosphere is fun. Wonderful place for family events and birthdays."}
{"text":"It's a spin off of Joe's but way better in my opinion. The manager on duty, Dawn, was great and went out of her way to make sure I understood the menu and layout. I'd recommend it to any seafood lover."}
{"text":"First time here!! Trifecta def the bomb!! Did muscles and king crab. Be sure to ask for tools! Those king crab outter shells will rip you up. The scizzors are the best.
Also added the sausage and potatoes. ...man an awesome addition with that seasoning. Tried some hush puppies.  All good. The only miss was the corn bread. Flat and too much honey. Not cakey/fluffy at all.
We will be back... ;-D"}
{"text":"Was really contemplating coming here due to the mixed reviews I read, but boy am I glad I went! It's not the boiling crab, but a close second in my book! We were instantly greeted and seated, it wasn't busy when we got there but it soon filled up. We were seated and out drink orders were taken almost immediately. As soon as our drinks arrived we ordered, 2 Dungeness crab for me, chicken fingers for the hubby and steamed rice for the girls. The market price for Dungeness crab was $14/lb today. Also keep in mind when coming here they don't do half pounds, you have to get the whole pound. Our food came out in 15 mins and we were grubbin! We got our choice of weapons to open the crab. And we dug in! It was glorious, I got the trifecta sauce/medium and it was pretty spicy! But oh so good! Our waiter came by to check on us frequently and each time we could just nod due to our faces stuffed with goodness. Free refills on the sodas and the steamed rice was $2. Reading the reviews I was scared that I wouldn't like the food, but I am so glad we came here! Will definite be back! Hope they stay good and fairly priced!"}
{"text":"Dear Angry Crab & BBQ, 
I have nothing nothing nothing if I don't have you. From the friendly staff right down to the sweet potato fries, this place never disappoints! I drive from Tucson at least twice a month to get my skrimp fix lol. I definitely recommend the trifecta sauce (I usually go with level 3 for heat) and I also highly recommend the clams with the pacific rim sauce level 2 because that curry spice will get you if you're not careful . Hands down, my favorite place ever! WAY better than Hot N Juicy!"}
{"text":"I went here on a busy night they wait was about 30 min. the good thing is that they have a text system where you don't have to stand around and hold a pager. the downside of the text system is that sometimes it works and sometimes its delayed dues to wifi issues or something. that's what I was told lol. I don't remember our servers name but he was really cool. they warn you that they're hot is REALLY hot but it wasn't at all...BUT  I love spicy food and it didn't phase me. Everything was ok but extremely greasy for steamed seafood. I had all the seasonings mixed together, hot.. I forget what they called it. I've tried a few other restaurants w the same concept and they're the only ones I found the food to be really greasy. I'm talking like if the sauce  (juice) gets cold it turns into like a chunky gel. that's probably the only reason we wouldn't return. other people seemed to really like it, ill stick to the other places I'm use to. try it for yourself its worth the try if you don't mind al lil grease in your steamed seafood."}
{"text":"We had to wait 30 minutes before we were served because they forgot about us and to be honest I was going to post a 1 star review, BUT our server was awesome and ended up taking care of us buying everyone a round of drinks. The food was amazing as well!"}
{"text":"OMG sooooo good! You get a pound of delicious crab, the tables paper-lined because you're just digging in and it gets super messy. It fuels that carnivorous craving. The only utensils you get are a couple leg-cracking things bc that's all you need. They do have just fish dishes too, if you aren't up for a pound of legs."}
{"text":"Giving this place 5 stars for the service alone! Our waiter was very friendly and took the time to explain menu options. The ambience great, my son enjoyed the paper covering on the table as he could draw freely. Onto the food, I had a half pound of brisket and my wife had a half pound of ribs. We shared the food and loved both the brisket and ribs! 2 choices of sauces with 5 levels of spice to choose from. Definitely coming back soon and would absolutely recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"I rarely say anything negative about restaurants, even less am I willing to leave a negative review but this was by far the worst experience I've ever had. I walk into the restaurant and waited for literally 10mins for the staff to notice I was waiting for a table. There was 2 staff members standing at the desk screwing around with the menus. It was quite obvious I was standing in front of them... Finally, the girl looked up and asked if we were waiting for a table... she was not very friendly and you could tell she hated her job. We were finally seated and here comes the worst waitress I've ever had... she was not super friendly and basically stared into my soul. She was so annoyed I was asking questions about items on the menu even though all I asked if fries come with that. I normally do not ask questions, I'm pretty simple when it comes to ordering but this girl made it seem like I was asking stupid questions. So she took our order and we waited probably about 20mins for our food to come. My father and my boyfriend got their meals but I did not. The waitress hadn't come back so there I was waiting for literally an entire hour for my food. My theory is that she forgot to place my order as well as the calamari we ordered. She didn't write it down and didn't seem surprised when they didn't bring my food out. Finally, when she actually took the time to come to our table, she noticed my food wasn't there..  HOW EXTREMELY ANNOYING. She kind of apologized and said she'd check on it... another 10mins later she came back and said the food should be out shortly and if I wanted it to go... are you freaking kidding me??? You took that long to notice our food wasn't here and now you want to rush me and give me a to go box???? I said hell no give me my damn food because I came to this restaurant to sit and eat, not take it to go because of YOUR NEGLIGENCE. Anyway, my food finally came and she showed up another 10mins later and noticed our calamari still wasn't there. She said she'd comp the calamari but the bill was still $82!!! I've been to a different Angry Crab Shack before and it was great but this particular location was horrible. If you want great food and great service, choose a different location. This was the worst experience I've ever had and I typically don't complain. Trust me when I say this place has horrible service."}
{"text":"Honestly had an awesome experience. Nothing better than eating with family. Now if you don't like getting your hands dirty, this is NOT the place for you. Our table and hands were covered with delicious seasonings and oil. The king crab, and snow crab were delicious! The crawfish were okay, but once you have homemade crawfish from a grandma raise in Baton Rouge, you tend to have a big bias. I loved the shrimp and it was fun to play with the little shrimp heads and make stories and jokes (don't laugh at how weird my family is hah). We seasoned with the trifecta (medium spice level) and it was amazing. Best onion rings we ever had!!! Even my cousin from across the pond got a second order he loved them so much. Great experience, but prepare to spend. For 6 of us, it was $178 plus tip and for what we got? It wasn't bad at all! In SF half the fish would cost the same."}
{"text":"Went to the Mesa location off of Alma School and Guadalupe, it was a little tucked away but is view-able from Guadalupe. This was my first time at this place and I wasn't sure what to expect. The exterior is a little bland which worked I think because the interior is definitely the exact opposite. The atmosphere has that New Orleans vibe and has the music and walls to enforce it. We were sat down immediately got a seat right near the kitchen so we got to see all the food coming out and the smells that come with them. The wait staff was friendly and they helped explain the menu to us which isn't complicated but with trying to absorb all of my surroundings, I need some explanation. Basically it was choose your food, choose the seasonings, choose the spice level, and then add some extra fillings like sausage, corn, or potatoes. I got a pound of shrimp with the trifecta seasonings and medium spice level with a sausage thrown in. The food comes out in a clear bag and a metal bucket, you put on your provided bib and then eat right out of the bag! IT was awesome and the food was amazing. I have never had to rip the heads off my shrimp before to eat them but it was an experience I will not forget. I plan on returning and trying the other food items on the menu. Plus being able to draw on the walls added a nice final touch."}
{"text":"This is are or was our favorite place. Even out of the other locations this has been our place for years. We order the usual my wife orders a pound of what she orders medium because she can't eat spicy like I can. I order what I order hot. Everything is good food gets there. We check the tags like we always do to make sure we got the right one. I realize mine has no kick and my wife is sweating. So I grab a shrimp and dip it in the sauce in her bag and it's spicy. I tell the waitress what happened. It was a mistake so I ask her for a side of hot for me and she says sorry about that I'll also get my manager so you can let him know. Cool manager by the name of Mich bring me the sauce which is hot. I tell him what happened and he says oh no that means the hot sauce in yours is in the corner. I tell him no that is not the case when I get my bag I flip it to make sure sauce is mixed and all over the food. He then points at the hot sauce he brought me and ask me \"Isn't that gonna fix it?\" I look at my wife while she is sweating because she can't eat spicy like me and tell him never mind thanks. He walks away not once did he apologize or take any kind of responsibility. No idea how Mich is in management that is beyond me. It was a mistake I understand it happens but the way he handled it I am lost for words. I wasn't asking for a discount just a simple apology and ownership for the mistake. If We go again and see him there we are walking right back out."}
{"text":"I've been driving by the sign for this place for awhile now, to go to the grocery store nearby, and to my surprise I realized they were actually open last night.  I walked in and was in heaven!!!  Creole and BBQ!?  You have the ultimate combination here!  I only tried the brisket and 1lb of shrimp (trifecta started w/ the hot heat level and ended up ramping it up to 5, I'm a hot girl) and they were both really good!  I plan to make this my new Sunday-funday and MNF spot!  The drinks were good and so were their specials.  I almost don't want to tell you how good everything was from the food to the drinks to the service because it's going to become super crowded, but then again, I do want them to stick around, so check them out, you won't be disappointed, there's something for everyone!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! The seafood tasted so fresh and that is because they fly it in daily and it is never frozen. We started out with a dozen oysters and they were perfection and tasted like they were just plucked from the salty ocean. I also ordered a pound of shrimp (whole meaty large pieces with the head intact) and chose the trifecta sauce at a level 2 (jalapeño spicy level) and it was spicy and full of flavor. My hubby got the shrimp and crab legs at chose level 6 because he is insane and loves super super spicy foods. Level 6 is the Caroline Reaper pepper (hottest pepper out there) and a level 3 is habaneros. So if you like spicy foods you will love the heat levels here. Besides their seafood by the pound selections you can also get fried seafood baskets like catfish and fries and their were also po'boys. The waiters were super friendly and helpful with the menu choices. We are seafood lovers so we will definitely return soon!"}
{"text":"In Arizona on a road trip we see this this place on yelp as hot and new and it is I live in San Diego and i know fresh seafood and for being in the desert it's pretty damn fresh it reminds me of boiling crab the only thing this place needs to do is allow you to order half and half instead of a full order of shrimp or whatever and maybe ditch the bbq menu I didn't try it but the seafood is enough to keep people coming back service was great and if I am ever in the area again I will be back"}
{"text":"I would eat here at least twice a month if I could.  Can't handle the calories or the $$, but it is definitely a treat.  My fave is the shrimp with the trifecta. The recently changed their cornbread, but still very good.  And they have Abita purple haze on tap!!!  Only thing I would keep in mind is that you do get rather messy, and the shellfish is boiled with the shell on, so be prepared to \"clean\" some of it if you know what I mean. A definite must try if you like seafood."}
{"text":"I can't even tell you how much I love this place.  I was a borderline stalker waiting for this location to open.  Now I come at least once a week.  Shrimp & snow  trifecta are my go to."}
{"text":"I am upping my rating. Went back yesterday for the first time in awhile and service has definitely improved and food supply was better. I believe the only thing they didn't have was blue crabs. No worries. I don't order them anyway. 
I have such a love hate relationship with this place. I love getting messy and having fun with my food. But prices are high (yes, I get it we are in AZ and the ocean isn't next door) but I just don't leave full feeling. I usually get crawfish and shrimp. I was happy they finally had some crawfish."}
{"text":"Hands down great. Drinks, service, food all perfect. Came to PHX on business and was looking for a different place for good food to relax. I was very pleasantly surprised. The staff explained how the menu worked and made some good suggestions. We were not rushed and Suzette checked on us several times to make sure everything was right. We will definitely eat here when we come back. Congratulations to the management, staff and cooks, this place is all around great."}
{"text":"Well damn! I feel guilty that i have not written a review yet! I have been here MULTIPLE times and each time i leave full and satisfied. This place is first come first serve and does get crazy packed, so be prepared to wait. I love the chill laid back atmosphere. I always get a nice cold beer while I'm waiting for a table. Inside and outdoor eating. Everything is good here from what i hear but i can only vouch for the crab, shrimp and hushpuppies! Its what we get every time. My absolute fav is getting 1lb of the king crab spicy level of 3 and trifecta sauce! DELICIOUS!! and hot! But delicious! it can be a bit of an expensive dinner even just for two people...but it is really worth the splurge if you want to get your cracking crab on!

I love it here so don't be surprised if ya see me!"}
{"text":"The Angry Crab was sooooo fun! We didn't know what to expect and we were so pleased. We each got a boil (crab and shrimp) and our kids got Po Boys. Everything was great! I got the Trifecta in my boil with a 2 heat. My mouth was on fire!!! My husband got a 3 and it was too spicy for us. I think I'll get a 1 next time. All in all, it was a great time and we plan to make this a birthday spot going forward."}
{"text":"Ok, I have now been here 4 times and the last time with 6 friends. I was super
Impressed on the service again and we just loved this place. I tried King Crab, Mussels,Crawfish, Shrimp, fried shrimp, fried Cod, gumbo, sausage and French fires. Yes I was stuffed. Just awesome. I tried other seasonings and different heat levels. Love the Trifecta with medium heat. Highly recommended. Great beer and wine prices."}
{"text":"It was good.  Not exactly what I was hoping for but it's the desert so what did I expect from a sea food place.  The menu left a little to be desired as ordering items by the pound when going out to eat left me wondering if I ordered enough or too much.  Personally, not bad food, just not something I felt was worth the price."}
{"text":"Great food for what it is. We had clams and shrimp trifecta. Amazing! Fun atmosphere, great service. Susan was very helpful in ordering and was really sweet. The spice level was intense. We both got level 1 and my husband loves spicy stuff and he thought he would get a 0 the next time. We will definitely go back and would recommend it to anyone looking for Cajun seafood."}
{"text":"I really like the Angry Crab chain. I usually go to their first location on Alma School and Guadalupe in Mesa, but, since I was on this side of town, I decided to meet up with my sister here for dinner. The food was fantastic as always, however, I have to give this location a 4 star because of their service. It's understandable that the service wouldn't be up to par, since my waiter was in training. But for me to have to ask for water 5 times and utensils 3 times, that's a bit ridiculous... Other than that, everything else was fantastic"}
{"text":"Ordered 2lb shrimp, 3lb crawfish, 1lb clams, 1lb snow crab legs. Was quoted 74$. But before driving down to pick up, I was informed it was 94$ (would have been nice if you called me back to correct it).  We didn't go with the snow crab legs. The clams unfortunately had about 7 shells with no meat inside. Pretty disappointing. The sauce was pretty light on the flavor, we had mild trifecta."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Amazing food with even better flavor, love that you get to use your hands cause everything comes in a bag! Plus the birthday/celebration vibe is way to fun!!!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time. The food and the experience were both good and fun.

I drive by from time to time and I give it a look and a thought. But, I haven't been back.

I think the reason is that I'm not all that into having to work at feeding myself. So, the peel 'n eat concept, while fun, is work.

Outside of that, though, again, good food, good value and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Not quite what i wanted as far as a knock your socks off cajun boil. I like crawfish that has soaked in wonderful spices. It has to be good enough to suck the head. This was good enough just to eat the tail. The king crab was average. Ive been spoiled with better so this review is partially unfair. I would eat here again but I reserve 5 stars for the best and usually that is found closer to louisiana. I will come back."}
{"text":"First time I went to eat at Angry Crab Shack was with my family. Of course I didn't know what to expect since I've never experience a messy eating type of food place.  Overall, the food was good and service was decent. 

Just a month ago I went to Cali  with some friends and for the first time ate at Boiling Crab. I didn't want to compare Angry Crab Shack to Boiling Crab but I never realized how different it was after coming back a second time to Angry Crab Shack. I went to dinner at Angry Crab Shack and went with friends this time but It wasn't as great as the first since now I know what to expect. The wait is always going to take forever but when we were finally getting ready to be seated we noticed that they were out of a few selection of food. So, that sucks. We ordered 1lb of Trifecta- king crab legs, blue  crab, shrimp, oysters, mussels, and cajun fries. 

When we got our food we couldn't help but notice how oily and flavorless the sauce was. And yes, since we live in the desert I guess its a given that seafood are not as fresh as we want it to be. 
We didn't get lime + pepper&salt till a little later on after we got some of the food we ordered. It took almost till we were done eating with everything else before the fries was brought to the table. We were told that one of their fryers were broken and that's why it took a little longer for the fries to come out and that there were others who are waiting for it too. Yet, the people next to our table that was sat a little later after us got their fries in time before their main food was brought out. Hmmm, wonder how that happened. 

The waitresses were nice and service was okay but it could have been better. I know at places like this its expected for it to be a really busy environment but it felt a little too chaotic and unorganized I think. If you're going to wait for an hour or more at least make the food worth the wait. 

I'm not mean I swear or trying to bash on the place completely. I'm sure its the best were gonna get living out here in Az  that's close to the same idea of Boiling Crab. Overall, Angry Crab Shack is alright."}
{"text":"So got contacted by them and was told this couldn't have happened. Didn't try to talk in person. The manager never returned call. Pretty much just called me a liar and moved on. Oh, well. I know where not to go now."}
{"text":"Last night, my family and I went to the Angry Crab. The food was amazing and seasoned to perfection. Great service, and positive vibe! We can't wait to go back.."}
{"text":"Our server Mack was awesome and the food was great. The only complaint is they were a little too busy for their own good."}
{"text":"Service: Our waitress was fabulous.  She was friendly and helpful without being annoying,  if you know what I mean.  

Decor: completely laid back and comfortable.  Fyi, you will make a mess here and its acceptable to eat with your hands.  They just put bags of hot steamy goodness in your table and you dig in.  Then they roll up the table cloth and throw it all away.  

Food: the snow crab is seriously amazing.  We are talking hallelujah choir amazing.  The shrimp was so so,  but the waitress said they have been working on a cooking technique for their shrimp.  The king crab was good,  solid choice.  Dungeness was well,  I've honestly never had it before and it may have been fabulous but i couldn't get past the eyes and fur. Lol,  but that's on me i suppose.  The Cajun fries are solid.  Cole slaw was good between spicy bites of seafood goodness.  They also give you a basket of limes and a dish of salt and pepper with instructions to squeeze the limes into the salt mixture.  Dip your crab into it from time to time,  it's delicious.  

Will be back for sure!  Thanks Dan for the great food!"}
{"text":"Great crab and choices of seasoning. Fun atmosphere for larger groups. Come hungry because they will serve tons of great food."}
{"text":"Nice place for seafood in a landlocked state. They do a market style by the pound for their steam pots. The only suggestions are better customer service and cleaner bathrooms."}
{"text":"This place has never disappointed. The food is delish...I always get a bag of seafood and always love it. I haven't been there in quite awhile and was a bit bummed that they didn't have their Monday mixed bag special. I like variety! Please consider bringing that back!"}
{"text":"Leave the house sauses on the side. I like spieces. Not when they're so hot they mask the natural flavors"}
{"text":"This place was a pretty cool place to go!  I love the cajun theme restaurants.  love crawfish in the oven bags with \"the whole shebang\", or trifecta as it is know at the angry crab.  Wasn't too to impressed with the crawfish here, we ordered a pound of the trifecta with 2 spice.  some of the crawfish were not fresh to say the least.  we ordered a lb of the Blue crab, shrimp, crawfish, and mussels,  all the same flavor and heat. i liked the shrimp, and mussels.  :)  we also tried a shrimp po boy and some fried clams.. lacking in the shrimp on the po boy, clams were ok.  I will be back!  the beers and good time was well worth it!  3.5 stars for the food, half star added for the cool factor!"}
{"text":"Going to the same restaurant TWICE within two weeks speaks for itself!!!

First visit was recently on a Friday night. Restaurant was crowded, but that was expected when walking in the door shortly after 6pm. I put my name on the waitlist and was told the wait would be 20-25 minutes-but about five minutes later we were immediately seated in a booth! (This might be due to larger parties, or perhaps because we were only a party of 2, perhaps?).
Since I had read previous reviews, I had a good idea of what to order:
We chose 2# of Snow Crab in the Trifecta sauce, Heat #2. Added 4 red potatoes and the smoked sausage. Couldn't have been more perfect. Added a side of hush puppies, which were also delicious-crunchy on the outside, but hot and moist on the inside! Only downside was the 1/2 pound of bbq brisket that we ordered as an appetizer. Five slices, that although moist, was nothing to rave about. Since Kansas City is my hometown, had high expectations. But perhaps it was an off night for bbq? Pulled pork might have been a better choice, but we went on the recommendation of our server. She was very friendly and attentive. Lots of dining help that frequently stopped by to either fill our water or empty our overflowing bucket of eaten crab. I raved about this place to everyone at work(high praise since I lived in Seattle previously before moving back here). I couldn't wait to go back! And I did. Last night with my best friend. Ordered the exact same as mentioned above but nixed on the brisket. He totally LOVED the food. I also ordered some fried oysters, fried calamari and hushpuppies to go for lunch the next day...what can I say, this place ROCKS!!!

Angry Crab, keep doing what you do, and you will have a loyal following ;)"}
{"text":"What a fun experience!! If you're looking for some craziness and crab, this is your spot. The staff is very friendly and gets you started right if you've never been there before. 

The environment is loud because that's their thing and that's okay! If you order their seafood, they steam it fresh in a bag with your choice of marinade/sauce and then bring it out to your table...in that same bag! You have to reach in and get your hands dirty but don't worry, they give you bibs. Your table is also set on a piece of butcher paper so the mess is easy to clean up, just go for it! My boyfriend and his father ordered the snow crab and mussels and they enjoyed it all thoroughly. 

I decided to take the road a little less traveled and went for the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich. It was really yummy topped with coleslaw (my fav way to have pulled pork) and the side of fries were well seasoned. 

When someone orders the King Crab they ring a loud bell and chant. The first time it happens it's a bit startling but you get used to it as your meal goes on. I can't wait to head back and try some crab myself!"}
{"text":"Food was trash. The shrimp were overcooked and boiling hot when they were served to me. They were tasteless. The salt, pepper & limes didnt help add any flavor to it. It's my fault for picking a place that serves bbq AND shrimp. They got neither cusine right. My husband got the BBQ and it was meh at best. So neither dishes were served right and they still managed to screw up the French fries. They barely had any hint of Cajun and tasted bland to me."}
{"text":"What an incredible staff! The atmosphere was delicious as well as the food. Prepare to get messy and do everything at the dinner table you were taught never to do!

We had crab, shrimp, sausage, corn, red potatoes and cole slaw.  The trifecta sauce with medium Heat was the perfect suggestion, from our server.  The mix of spice and rich buttery chin dripping sauce was super tasty and decadent.

It is really kind of hard to explain the experience fully, you just have to try it for yourself! Dress to get messy!"}
{"text":"I  checked out the Angry Crab today and it was a good experience.  I ordered the King Crab, snow crab, mussels, oysters. My husband loved the oysters. I was pleased but the crab was a little under seasoned and the shell of the crab was a little soft. Overall it was good. After all this is Arizona!  So for here it was good. I will go again.  They also have a military discount that's a plus for us. Our waitress was Julie she was awesome!  She kept our drinks full and stayed asking us if we needed anything and they were extra busy. So I will give them 4 stars."}
{"text":"Dil was our waiter for a very large birthday party celebration!! He was a wonderful waiter!!! He had a few helpers and they were all awesome. This was my first time here with my family of 5. They had great options for my children that don't eat seafood!! We will definitely be back and try something new next time!! Again Dil was funny and attentive and we truly enjoyed our visit here. Thank you for great food and great times!!"}
{"text":"Excellent crab, shrimp, lobster.  Very casual atmosphere.  Usually a wait, so get there early.  Raw oysters are incredible.  Bartender makes a mean Moscow Mule."}
{"text":"Food was great. Staff was great as well as the atmosphere. Server told us that the sauces were on the hot side so we went with medium. Found the heat to really not be there. I think I read in another review that it's very oily which I found to be true. We had 3 different bags of food and got the same flavor and heat in all of them. Didn't find the 3 different bags to be very consistent with the flavors or heat. Now I'm not complaining about it cause it was good but I like consistency when I go to places."}
{"text":"BEST SEAFOOD IN ARIZONA!! Trifecta sauce is amazing ! Lobster is the best ! Shrimp is huge and oysters always fresh"}
{"text":"Can I give this place 10 stars? If you have not tried this place, you must go. What are you waiting for? Love everything about this place. The food is delicious. The staff is amazing. Have tried so many things on the menu and loved everything. Go easy on the heat if you go not like spicy food. You can't go wrong with the crab legs and shrimp. Add some sausage, corn on the cob and potatoes and your belly will thank you."}
{"text":"Islam was so nice! Food came out quick, service was efficient...and it was delicious. Whenever we're in town, we'll definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"So good! My husband and I went here one night because we always see a line out the door. I can see why! Our server was so nice, extremely knowledgable about the menu and even showed us how to crack open our crab. Our appetizers came out so quickly followed by our boil bag. You could tell everything was so fresh and tasted delicious! They sell all their seafood at market value so the prices are very reasonable. We loved everything about this place and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome Awesome Food!  The service was great! Brian ruled!! 

If you love your spice this is the place for you!! #4 was great -  can't wait to try #5 and traditional boil #6!! 

The seafood was super fresh and the addition of sausage and corn put the meal over the top!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for a few years now and really wanted to love it but I'm so disappointed. Maybe it's just what we ordered but I'll never go back. I had the soft shell crab po'boy that was flavorless except for the strong taste of fishy water. Now I know this is seafood but this was bad, I actually got grossed out and slathered it with cocktail sauce to mask the fishiness because I was quite hungry but it didn't help. My husband had the fried shrimp basket which while not bad, it was nothing special. I will say my sweet potato fries were good and the calamari was decent. The kids meals were good too and very large in portion. Not the worst food I've ever had but nowhere near the $70+ spent."}
{"text":"What a fun experience!  Had the crawfish with mild heat and the trifecta flavoring with sausage.  It was better than my boyfriend's shrimp and I loved the shrimp.  Service was great.  The only down fall was that the music was so loud.  It was 2pm on a Saturday.  I wasn't ready to party."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch with my mom. She can't handle spicy food, she liked the fried cod and fries. The ketchup on the table is a little spicy and she did not like the coleslaw, too much vinegar not sweet. I had the snow crab with the sweet and tangy sauce with sausage and corn and it was good. I will being go back in the future and take my wife, who can handle spicy food."}
{"text":"Love this place for shell fish crave in the valley. I've been to their Mesa restaurant first and started going to the Phoenix location as it is closer to me. They've expanded to west valley and glad they did! I typically get the Dungeness crab trifecta with spice of 3 but recently started having it with traditional spice of 2. I've tried their shrimp and mussels which both are also delicious. Service is as fast as they can depending on crowd and always friendly. A must try if you love your shell fish or want to try!"}
{"text":"As Arizonans, we long to eat something that comes from the mysterious pools of water that surround the globe. Closest I've been to a pool of water bigger than my bathtub is Tempe Town Lake - where I sometime contemplate whether I should throw myself in because all we have is Red Lobster and ... yeah, that's it. 

 Can't afford Joe's Crab Shack? Here's your plan B. 

I wasn't expecting much as it's in a empty-plaza and of all places, right next door to kid-germ infested Jambo. I went for Sunday dinner and asked for a table of two. The 2 hostess' at the front whose job is to just stand around and act like an extra on the set of Clueless told me that I had to wait until my entire party arrived. The place is only half-filled. I understand this policy at restaurants, but I'm just a party of 2 - not the freaking Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade coming through. 

When my friend finally did come, I stood in front of the 2 hostess' and we awkwardly stood there facing each other, until I realized that they weren't going to do anything until I spoke up. I was already annoyed about not being able to sit down in a half empty restaurant and now I'm speaking to robots?

Service is a little scattered. Servers are assigned tables but I feel like every server just walks around aimlessly. They often came up and asked us if we had already been helped 3 times each throughout the night. Every table had to wait a little while until they were even recognized as having just sat down with no menus or water. Kind of have to wave someone down and tell them what you need. Good thing they have flat screens all around to watch and pass the time.

Food - Pretty good and prices aren't too shabby either. My friend ordered the clams and shrimp while I ordered Snow Crab legs. I was expecting small pieces of shrimp, but the sizes exceeded my expectation and were pretty big in my opinion. My friend had the trifecta and spiciness really is hit or miss. You could order medium and it'll feel like the depths of hell in your mouth and sometimes it's barely there. I ordered the garlic, which was pretty good and probably soaked with tons of butter, but mah belly doesn't mind some baby fat. Snow crab legs were of decent size too, not like the skinny anorexic crab legs you get at the casino buffet. Wish they came with sides instead of having to pay extra though. They ran out of utensils to help you with cracking, so the server gave me a rock. That was something new.

All in all, if you're wanting some seafood and a new experience while on a budget, come here. I'd rather save up my money and go to Joe's where I can get better service, more portions, and sides altogether for an extra 6 dollars. I'll come back again once more where hopefully, the service has improved. Ask for a marker and sign your name away on the wooden walls."}
{"text":"Unique restaurant with great food, fun atmosphere, and fabulous staff. We were newbies and Maria spent time answering questions and walking us through the process. We got three different boil bags (king crab, clams, shrimp) and shared. Yum!!!!"}
{"text":"Their crab, crawfish, and shrimp are made to order just how you want it. You pick the # of pounds, the sauce/flavor type, and level of spiciness. We love the trifecta and level 2 spiciness. We ordered about $100 worth and just feasted like kings. Their seafood gumbo is one of the best I've ever had!!! I'm from the dirty south. I would know! This is a great place to go with a group of friends so you could each order a few things each, grab a beer and share! Oh, and their cajun fries are amazing!!! Super crispy, seasoned well, and comes out hot every time!"}
{"text":"Definitely pricey, but it was oh so fun ripping the bag open and pulling out our crab and clams. The clams were perhaps the best I've ever had. Very sweet and tender! 

We got a whole crab and when it was time to eat the body, the server was kind enough to put gloves on and help us out. He showed us which parts were edible.

My toddler loved the fried fish basket. We also got some red potatoes which were a cost-effective way to stretch the meal. And they allowed us to really taste the spices. 

Next time we have a hankering for seafood that tastes like we're on the coast, we can head here."}
{"text":"This place is great! Drive by around lunch time, this place looks dead. Dinner time... It is packed. The dungeonous crab is cooked to perfection. The buffalo chicken Po Boy is lights out. And don;t even get me start on the bloody mary! All I've got to say about the bloody mary is this. If you go here, DO NOT leave without getting a bloody mary!"}
{"text":"Food is great!! Seat capacity for a party of 6 or more for us is always a long wait of 45-1 hour! Wish this place had more sections to accommodate large parties!"}
{"text":"I had to update my review because I decided to give this restaurant another chance. I decided to go back here for dinner because I was craving seafood. We ordered a pound of crawfish, mussels, and sausages added with 2 bowls of rice. Most importantly I ordered 2 blue crabs again which this time it was fully cooked. I had to tell them I wanted it well done so that we don't get them kind of raw again. I guess from now on that's what I have to tell them so they won't make the same mistake. Service was definitely better because we had a different server who was much nicer and kept checking up on us.. I must say this second time around everything came out great! Surprisingly. Everything was fully cooked and tasted really good. I will definitely be back as long as they cooked my food fully. No more raw meat!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Way better than their other location in mesa! Friendly people and great food! The atmosphere here is way better also because there's more room. This one has bbq and the other doesn't. Had the brisket with the sides of potato salad and coleslaw. Mmmm mmmm good. I just got done eating here and writing this makes me hungry again. I guess I have ten stomach.. Also ordered 3 pounds of crawfish with medium trifecta sauce. Had sausages inside mixed with the crawfish inside the bag and ordered rice as well. So delicious I will be back here even though it's always crowded. It is worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant employs a DD Adult. I think that is Awesome of them. Not to mention the food is so awesome."}
{"text":"Angry Crab is my favorite restaurant in this area. The service is great, the food is delicious and the waits are short now that they've opened more locations. This is a great place to grab a beer and a bag of shrimp for a low key meal with friends. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Angry Crab is a great addition to the Arcadia Neighborhood!  I haven't had their BBQ but their seafood is awesome.  I usually go with Snow Crab, they are cheap and already cleaned for you unlike the Dungeness that come whole and need to be cleaned.  I also love their shrimp which are a steal per lb and HUGE!  I am talking prawn size, cooked whole head on with all the delicious juices.  

I am a wuss when it comes to spice and I usually ask for a 0 but still feel some heat on my lips.  I also order some bread for soppin to get all those extra juices that are left on the table.  I am not a big shellfish person but my friend loved their raw bar oysters and the mussels.

Mondays are the best days to go for \"Mixed Bag Mondays\".  MBM is house choice of seafood plus mixed veggies for $20.  Get there for happy hour (3-7 PM) for cheap eats and cheaper booze.  This is my go to place when I have friends in town visiting or just a day to treat myself."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been huge fans of Angry Crab since we discovered the Alma School location a few years ago. When this location opened we were super excited, living on the East side of town. The first couple visits were ok, attributed what was lacking to it being a new location and new staff. However, this last visit (for my wife's birthday) sealed the deal for this location. And the manager is to thank for that. There was some sort of mix up in the kitchen, that mix up resulted in the only meal not being made being my wife's, the birthday girl. The server apologized and said his manager would be over shortly. Not cool, but cool. Manager walks up with the missing food. Says, \"Here's the crab legs.\" Plops them down in front of her (Obvious that they're hers as she's the only one without food) and walks away. Not a word. Being seated with a 15 year restaurant manager and another with over five years of serving experience, we were a bit shocked. That was the last we saw the manager. There was a small discount on the bill, which we found when the checks were brought out. I'm not one to demand free things when a mistake is made on a busy Saturday night. But as a paying costumer, I do expect solid customer service from management. And that, we didn't receive."}
{"text":"Loved it! So happy to finally have a place like this in Arizona thats close by. We are Southern California natives and are spoiled with places like Kickin' Crab and Boiling Crab out there. Glad to say this place met our expectations!

Got the pound of shrimp with corn and potatoes in trifecta sauce, dozen oysters, and cajun fries. The shrimp was great and a level 2 trifecta was definitely spicy considering we both grew up eating spicy food! The potatoes and corn were big portions to our surprise, we could have ordered less. The cajun fries were just alright, but we ordered two baskets of it to cool down our tongues from the spicy shrimp. And last but not least, the oysters were fresh and huge! Hubby loves oysters so if he approves then so do I. Seriously though, these oysters were so meaty we were a little worried they were on steroids or something haha. One complaint is that they don't do half pounds or offer combos with mixed seafood unless you get it by the pound. Good customer service, and no wait at 3:30pm on a Friday. Food comes out fast too!

So recap: 1 lb. shrimp, 4 potatoes, 3 corn (half pieces), 2 baskets of fries, a dozen oysters. Came to $41 excluding tip. Great deal. No left overs but a huge food coma after. 

Needless to say, we will return! We tried the surf, maybe we'll try some of the turf next time!"}
{"text":"The first time I enjoyed Angry Crab it was in Mesa. Jolly M. insisted so my brother, Rick and myself drove out. Plastic bib secured I could not understand how anyone would need the sinks located in the eating area.

You will come to appreciate them.
The food is a hands on event. Messy and delicious. You rip shrimp, crawfish, whatever you've selected, apart with your hands and juice goes flying. It's all over the place. You get stuff on your hands, sure. Seasoning magically migrates past your mouth to your cheeks. It isn't pretty. Perhaps this isn't a first date place.

Warning: I would carefully select the spice level as it is no joking matter. Last night Angry Crab made an appearance at the Scottsdale Spice event. When asked what level of spice I wanted, I quickly said, \"Yes. I'll take the hot level of whatever you've got.\"

Rarely do I encounter food so spicy I become hot under the collar. After gulping down some shrimp I start making polite conversation.

But No. I turn to the nearest table for a napkin so I can blow my nose. I interrupt someone for this piece of paper product. I need it. (Doesn't help.) I cough. (Doesn't help.) I suck down some small beverage in a desperate attempt to stop the molten fire in my throat. (Nope. Doesn't help.) I toss off the top of my VOSS water bottle. Drink most of the remaining 16.9 ounces back.

I'm D-y-i-n-g.

As I begin to panic I scope the room. I'm not even pretending to pay attention to conversation anymore. I stumble to the bar with the shortest line in desperation. I need something. ANYTHING.

Thankfully someone mercifully tossed me some agua. (Do I sound grateful enough? Because I can't articulate how much of a defcon situation this was.) At which point a small beverage felt just about right.

Spicy.
Hot.
Delicious.

My many years of eating Indian food back east have failed me. I need to practice more 

p.s. The 28th St & Indian School location of Angry Crab is opening in TWO weeks!"}
{"text":"It was my first time ever eating crab and catfish. Catfish was phenomenal, moist, tender and I loved it. Crab was great too.  My husband is an avid catfish fan and he said the cat fish was excellent. Atmosphere was great, friendly, welcoming and casual.   Waitress was very charming, friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"This is definitely a must do place for seafood boil. The food was excellent! it was my first experience of the Creole cuisine and I enjoyed it thoroughly. You can build your seafood boil in 3 simple steps - 1. choose your seafood type (priced by the pound) 2. Choose your sauce (our server recommended Trifecta (Kajun + lemon+ garlic) and it was simply delicious. 3.  Chose your spice level - anything 3 and above is order at your risk. We did our craw fish with Trifecta sauce at spice level 3 & the snow crab at level 4. Though delicious, 3 was definitely spicy and I can handle spicy food - so for those who can not handle heat, stick to spice levels 1 & 2. Their service was good too. We were seated immediately and since this was our first time there, our server walked us through their menu and gave us good recommendations. We enjoyed our meal and the whole experience. We will surely go back for more of that delicious sea food."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!!! I sat 15 minutes before someone asked me what I wanted to drink. After my meal, no one ever came to give me my check, I had to goto the front and pay. Very unprofessional!!!! Food was good, but I would spend my money somewhere else."}
{"text":"went to celibate my wife's birthday, we ordered a draft beer (Blue Moon) and my wife said something smells bad, and handed me the beer, they had garnished the beer with a rotten orange slice :(  , The waiter took the price of the beer off of our bill. My question is How does this happen?? and what other corners are being cut that are not so obvious?? This killed our special night out."}
{"text":"Great place with friendly staff and management, they need to work on their to go orders system , but still a great resturant."}
{"text":"This place is soooo awesome ! I'm so picky on my seafood and this place was amazing ! My dad catches his crab straight from the ocean and he was even impressed ! Love this place ! I will be back !"}
{"text":"Okay, as Cajun woman living in East Mesa, I have eagerly been awaiting the opening of this place 1/4 mile from my home. My husband and I came in opening night. Overall, I think this place is amazing; I do have some other feedback, as well. 

First of all: The place is huge. I didn't realize it was that big. It's great there's lots of space, plenty of sports on. It was very clean and you can write on the wall, which is fun. I meant to ask for a Sharpie, but I forgot; next time.  Jazz filled the air, which I love, but I also hope to hear some zydeco played, in the future. 

The table of people near us were quite loud and, a few times, invasive. This is not a reflection on the establishment itself, but it did take away from the enjoyment of the experience. 

Noel was our server, and he was friendly and attentive. He answered any questions we had with ease, and displayed a positive attitude. 

My husband ordered the Abita Amber. I chose not to drink this time, but I'm so happy to have some Abita options close by. What was definitely lacking was SWEET TEA.  I fully expected a restaurant like this would have it, and was very disappointed they do not serve sweet tea. Please change that!!!!

Of course, one of the things I was most excited about was having my favorite food in the whole world - boiled crawfish (surely to be a staple on heaven's banqueting table). We ordered it and were told they had run out. That was a real bummer. I have grace for this because it was around 9pm when we arrived, and I'm sure they had been quite busy on opening day. Still, I had a moment of mourning. 

We placed an order for hushpuppies. The flavors were amazing and highly approved by this Cajun. However, they were obviously cooked in grease that was too hot, as the outside was brown and crispy as it should be, but the inside was quite mushy. I'd be happy to give these another chance (again, the flavors are spot on), but I beg of you to watch the temperature of the grease. They are served with ranch (a dish typically served with remoulade), which I found to be an odd choice, but with the flavors, they don't really need a dipping sauce. 

We ordered a fried catfish basket to share. The portion of Cajun fries is very generous, and they are quite tasty. We ordered BBQ beans as the second side, and I would definitely recommend those, as well. The catfish, while not terrible, left some to be desired. I personally prefer thin-sliced catfish, and this piece was quite large. The breading was good, but it was also obvious the filet had been frozen at some point. I will refrain from ordering the catfish in the future. 

Since there was no crawfish, we ordered some boiled shrimp, Trifecta, of course (totally recommend) and Medium (to gauge the spice levels). I love spicy, but I have to be careful late at night. Personally, I found Trifecta + Medium to be PERFECT for shrimp. When I next go and order crawfish, I'll probably knock the spice up a notch or two. Amazing flavors, beautiful shrimp. My only complaint here is they were put into the plastic bag at a very high temperature, and when you do that with shrimp, they start to get mushy. Several of our shrimp were mushy, as a result. 

Again, amazing experience overall; just a few adjustments could be made. Fingers crossed there's an abundance of crawfish when I return. 

Thank you for coming to East Mesa!"}
{"text":"Great shrimp, oysters, mussels, crab, etc..  Anxious to try BBQ next go.
Fun place at fair prices."}
{"text":"Eating here was the best thing that has ever happened to me.  Forget kids, Jesus, college degrees, money, or diamonds...this food is better.  Vann was our waiter and helped us virgins order.   He was awesome!!  We ordered mixed veggies, crab, and shrimp in the trifecta sauce. I had to pull up my hair, put on a bib...and dig in....and it was work...but worth it!  I have nothing in life to look forward to again unless we come eat here....and we will!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!!! My husband and mother and I went here during our cross country road trip because it was something different and we couldn't have been more pleased! We left happy and stuffed. We had gator nuggets, gumbo (which I highly recommend!!!), po' boy, fried shrimp and 1 pound of shrimp. If you're in the area this is a must!"}
{"text":"We've been to the Angry Crab in Mesa many times and always had an enjoyable experience.  Last night we decided to try the Awhatukee location and it seemed a little off in terms of food quality and service.  BBQ Chicken was obviously not cooked to order and had been sitting in a warmer.  The snow crab wasn't the normal consistency or flavor, and the service just wasn't quite up to the standards at the Mesa location.  I'd be willing to give it another try, but the others in my party said they were done at this location.  Overall rating 2 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Love this place! Tried the other place that was said to have comparable food; was no comparison. Angry Crab has the best boiling bag seafood around! My favorite is the Dungeness crab trifecta medium heat!"}
{"text":"service at this location could have been better. way to long of a wait to be seated (went on a Wednesday night little people in there).  The lady at the door seen us came in but proceeded to flirty with the guy in front of us waiting for the rest of their party. Once seated, we still waited 5 mins before anyone came over to us to ask what we wanted to drink. Once we ordered never did get our bibs (signature item). And we were only checked up on ONCE during out whole time there. Overall, very disappointing and will NOT visit this location again. Do yourself a favor and go to another location."}
{"text":"The king crab legs were really good. The atmosphere is relaxed. The service was great. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Super fun! You order your meat and it comes in a bag and you Break open the meat yourself. I.e. Crab. Spicy is spicy though so beware!"}
{"text":"My family tries to go here every Friday! Best Cajun fries around! You'll definitely be seeing my family this Friday for my hub's birthday! They have great service and great food."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it was the day I came or this location, but the food just didn't live up to the other locations I have been to (Mesa and Phoenix). I picked up an order of gumbo for lunch one day, expecting what I have had at the other two locations - a soup with rice and all types of seafood in it. This was pretty much all rice, very thick, and had only shrimp in it plus a ton of sausage. It wasn't bad, but definitely less enjoyable than what I've had at the other locations. I can say, however, the space this Angry Crab occupies is very cool.... it's large and has these crazy huge fans on the ceiling.... I like that. Now, if we can get the food up to par, I'd be a happy camper! I'll most likely give this location another shot, it could have just been a bad day."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to get to try Angry Crab in Mesa after becoming a fan of the AC in Phoenix. This place is just ridiculously good. I went with a group and the service was just so efficient and friendly. I was going to get fried cod, but they were out.... a blessing in disguise. I got the gumbo, which just has all kinds of whatever seafood they have in it and a side of Cajun fries with level 3 trifecta sauce (of course). The gumbo was legit. I usually don't like many types of seafood, but I liked everything in this thing. I have no idea what I ate... it was spicy and delicious. The serving was huge, I barely had room for my fries and ended up taking most home. Speaking of fries.... these things were crispy, spicy, well seasoned, and addictive.... I love these fries! Anyway, I took my leftover fries and sauce home... I swear, that trifecta sauce is good on anything... I even had some on popcorn... no joke, it was awesome. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Ohhhhhhh mah god. This place is that good. 


Let me start by saying I was mad at this place.... I tried their food at Scottsdale Spice and thought I was going to die. Their 'hot' sauce turned out to be one of the hottest sauces you can get... it was so hot, I couldn't taste for about 30 minutes... it hurt.... so I was not so thrilled. 

Anyway, in hind sight, I decided that they were true to the festival and brought the heat and in the nature of being a good sport, I decided to come out to a UYE here tonight with a small group of Yelpers. I am so glad I did. This food was phenomenal. I had the hush puppies (3$ for about a thousand of them), which had jalapeno inside and were little fried balls of joy. I tried a grilled oyster... never had this before... it was so fantastic. Garlicky and wonderful. There aren't many places where I would actually order oysters, but this is now added to my list. For my meal, I had the fried cod po' boy (7$.... yes you read right... and this thing was big enough for 3 meals) with a side of the 'trifecta' sauce at a level 3 spiciness. This was damn good... spicy, without being too spicy. The fish was flavorful without being fishy. The bread was soft and delicious. The fries it came with were crunchy and spiced perfectly. This place has some serious 5 star potential pending a second visit (which should happen in the near future). Definitely recommend!!!


PS they have Abita beer here, which was good, and the service was fantastic... these guys really took care of us. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"The seafood is very fresh. My favorite item is the shrimp, and I also enjoy snow crab legs and blue crab (a seasonal choice only in season during months which contain the letter \"r\"). However, be forewarned... The level 5 heat is unbearably spicy. I had to use onion rings and ranch to stay alive. I think next time I will get a 3 level heat so I can actually taste the seafood."}
{"text":"We are visitors from the OC so this is totally like the  boiling crab except for with a larger variety. They're trifecta Aka the whole shaBang is a mixture of old bay, garlic minced, and Lemon pepper to it. We had 1lb of shrimp, 1 LB of King crab , Sweet potatoes, 1/2 dozen of the charboiled oysters (cheese, and bread) and an order of calamari. We Have No complaints the service was great! Wait time was about 30min and their restrooms were clean. Best part was you can play ping pong or horseshoes while you wait."}
{"text":"I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU. 

Ok, I am speaking to the 3.4 lb lobster I just had here for my birthday dinner, BUT...I do love you, Angry Crab. You make me happy. We come here often, almost always order the same thing (unless it's my birthday, then, well, lobster duh). 

1. Shrimp - Trifecta - #2 with Sausage, 4 Potatoes and 2 Corn cobs. OH, and 2 Kilt Lifters. :)
2. Snow Crab - Trifecta - #2 with Sausage, 4 Potatoes and 2 Corn cobs. And 2 Moscow Mules. 

AND...no gloves please. We, like all of the servers, make fun of those people. Neener-neener.

Atmosphere is very casual yet completely comfortable, service is always friendly and timely, and the food is consistently good. And look around, you'll see so many people smiling. Now that's success. 

And reflecting on that now, I think this is what makes me want to give 5 stars and keep coming back to a restaurant: It is consistently good. 

See you again soon Angry Crab Phoenix (it's the best one)."}
{"text":"Angry Crab is a blast with a large group (6 or more).  Get your food hot, and be prepared to make a mess!"}
{"text":"Cool concept, but they are obviously still working some kinks out.  

The good: food was smoked nicely and had good flavor.  Bar has a decent selection of beers to go along with the full bar menu.  Typical open stile floor plan.  Not a place for a quiet romantic dinner... 

The bad: The menu is confusing and disjointed at best.  Not to mention poorly done.  The spicing of the sauces is irregular and the staff says that the heat levels are off.  Best plan would be to order no spice and have the sauces on the side.  I like spicy food, but the \"mild\" completely over powered the smoke flavor.  

Easily this place could be a 4 or a 5, or drop down to a two when and if they can work those kinks out."}
{"text":"Finally a great seafood experience here in the desert! Ordered the shrimp, clams, crawfish, and raw oysters. Oysters were fantastic! We ordered our boiled goodness with the trifecta and heat level 4. Level 4 = very spicy but no problem still managing to keep the flavor. Plan on getting messy here and expect a wait on the weekends! Worth the wait, we will be back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place! It was like tele-porting into the south to get some amazing Cajun seafood! Service was great, atmosphere is very fun and loud.

It does run a little spicy so I would stay to the lower end of the spice spectrum.

Their Cajun fries are amazing and I highly recommend dipping them in the sauce from your bag!
I went twice in one week and plan on going back soon!"}
{"text":"Love love love!! I got 2 pounds of snow crab legs with the trifecta and if you are considering other sauces, don't! As the first timer, I was a little nervous about the trifecta sauce but the moment I caught a whiff of my order, I KNEW I made the right choice. Nothing else could possibly be better than the amazing trifecta, like oh my geeerd good lol. After the crab was done, I saved the sauce and made some bomb fried rice with it. But warning! You will have days of garlic breath hahaha I also got the cajun fries which was perfection."}
{"text":"My husband and I love eating Crab especially here!! It's so good! The atmosphere is awesome, the writing on the walls was a lot of fun, our service here has always been excellent too! I highly recommend this place!! I love the whole eating out of bag get messy kinda dates! I look forward to our Date nights because I get to choose and of course it's always here!! Our Son even loves this place! We actually always wish that we would have order more to take home! Thanks Angry Crab for the Great food and Excellent Service!  Merry Christmas"}
{"text":"Love this place! I was super happy to see that a Boiled seafood joint finally decided to open up in town (love the ones all over Southern California). The Angry Crab didn't disappoint with their super fresh seafood and awesome service. We will be back for a boil and brew when they get their alcohol license in December!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of crab. My favorite part is the taste of crab. Angry Crab seems to disagree with me. They spice and oil their crab to an absurd degree. There doesn't seem to be any preparation option where the taste of crab is even remotely respected. My wife got dungeness with garlic, I got blue crab with the \"trifecta\" - both MILD. Both were overcooked and over spiced. The blue crab in particular was reduced to a mushy disappointment, with WAY too much trifecta. I realize crab is an effort to eat, but I was unable to get any solid pieces of lump meat despite a fair amount of experience in my life liberating these usually wonderful morsels. The only tools they offer are scissors, my theory is that they have to cook the crab long enough for the shells to be cut with these scissors.  This is not a cheap meal. If I ever go back, I'll get shrimp... which is really sad because of how much I like crab.

The gumbo is legitimately delicious.  The sourdough bread for \"soppin' \" was undercooked and sliced about 1/3 of the way through. So basically you get a 1/4 sourdough baguette that you have to tear up by hand.  The corn in the bag was good.

Service was average. Our table was handed off to a different server  twice, 2 of the 3 were mostly attentive. The middle one seemed to take a 15 minute break right after I finished my drink, a cup of water required 3 requests.  The music was loud and incredibly bizarre. In rough order, it was zydeco, \"Separate Ways\" by Journey, New Orleans brass band, Incubus,  that \"marry that girl\" song, When the Saints go Marching in, and Red Hot Chili Peppers... some other crap too. I don't know what satellite station that is, but I would never have thought it to exist.

If you go for crab, order the dungeness. Way more meat for the effort. I guess king crab would be good too, but I'd be really angry if a $40/lb plastic bag of crab legs were prepared as poorly as what I had was.  Or, skip Angry Crab altogether."}
{"text":"Food was very good lots of flava. The service was great. Portions were large enough to share."}
{"text":"I love the concept

You get a table covered with Paper and different choices for sea food...

I am sure you can get enough information here what's this place is about...

I would say the sauce is very yummy and the food cook very nice served in a plastic bag, so yeaaaaaa you get dirty, I LOVE IT...

my favorites are:

*** Shrimps

*** Muscles

*** bag of vegetables 


B.S I ordered the Lobster before and not recommend it, its expensive and it come full size (you pay by pound) the best part is the tail and its just about 20% of what you pay for... also its come full size and its a lot of work to have it ready to eat...

But this place is on my TOP list for sea food around the area"}
{"text":"I love me a bag full of crab legs! 2nd time here & again fantastic. The trifecta seasoning is what I was recommended & it does not disappoint. We got hot in one bag & medium in the other, the medium may have been a mistake as it was pretty damn hot too. Crab legs, shrimp, lobster, taters, & corn, all really good. The draft beer selection is really good for a typical restaurant, lots of local brews. 

My only knock is that you have to ask for almost everything.... both times I've been. We asked for plates, silverware, bibs, scissors, butter for the crab legs. Not that big of a deal for me but I think it would be nice for a waiter/waitress to go over all the tools to attack the crab to see what you need as opposed to having to ask for everything. 

I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Meal and Delightful evening!  Thanks Angry Crab !

Great casual concept with food thats a total treat. as messy as it gets!  even tho there is a wait, it goes quickly and fun to people watch.. as it happens we decided to sit at the bar and eat there, and what a great decision that was, especially since we were lucky to have Ralph take care of us, and that he did..   He embodies what great service should always be, around and full of suggestions and information.  and his suggestions were right on...

he suggested the fireball cider drink.. and wow...  even gave me a sample of the fireball which clinched the deal and it made it through the night for me.. try it.  his suggestions regarding the choices of sea food, the flavors, everything was right on, throughout the meal constantly checking in with us and smiling and making everyone at the bar feel they were guests in his home!  it made the evening so much fun and the food so tasty.  we will def go back.. and hope to find Ralph at his station at the bar !

Thanks man...

ps it was Valentines day and i was with my sister who had never been there.. and just a wonderful fun evening,"}
{"text":"The place is awesome! ! The food, service and atmosphere is spot on!! Try it out! You will not be disappointed,  and a great value too!"}
{"text":"Food is always delicious. However, I visited the bathroom after and I am concerned as to the overall cleanliness of this establishment. Just disgusting. The server was also too busy for a late lunch."}
{"text":"Everything we had was amazing! The crab was the best I've ever had except for our waitress who was flirting with my husband in front of me and even kept rubbing his back and scratched it. Who the he'll does that type of crab? At a family dinner? Learn to be professional girls! Geez."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great atmosphere and fantastic food.  The seafood is actually super tasty and the flavoring is spot on.  A great place to enjoy not only your company, but your meal.

Everything we had there was delicious.  Be ready to get dirty though....you eat with your hands.  It adds so much to the restaurant."}
{"text":"We decided to follow the yelp community and try this place on Saturday night.  We had a fantastic time!  We ordered from the boiled bag side of the menu, fried shrimp and fries, as well as the gumbo.  The service was fantastic and the food was very good.  The place was bustling with excitement, great crowd but not a long wait, all of the food was delicious.  We will definitely be returning and would recommend this place for any seafood lover.  What a fun place!!!  The prices are very reasonable too."}
{"text":"Even though my colon hates me for it, I just can't stop coming.  I've tried the majority of the menu and I prefer the snow and king crab, trifecta is awesome.  Cajun fries are a must as well.  Looking forward to a restaurant in East Mesa."}
{"text":"The service is the best in the Phoenix Area. I have a server that, I always ask for Michelle.  Michelle is the best very knowledgeable about the menu. The Angry Crab foods are very, very close to Gulf Coast foods. This establishment gives me the flavor and foods from home. So if you like foods from the Gulf Coast please visit The Angry Crab. You will not leave hungry."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service and I wanna say how well your bussers maintain the restaurant."}
{"text":"The overall experience and ambiance if this place is great. We rolled up early evening on a Friday night and it was packed with people pouring out of the door and strewn about the patio. Hostess told us our wait would be around 30 minutes (totally fine) so we grabbed some drinks at the bar and waited outside on the patio in the cooling misters (nice touch). 

The wait turned out to be only about 20 minutes before we were seated, but another 10 or so before we met our waitress. Seemingly annoyed about something (maybe that we were first timers?), she explained the whole procedure of ordering at the Angry Crab Shack and left us to consider our dinner options. The menu is small and uncomplicated, so we figured out what we wanted pretty quickly. However, it was 17 minutes before we caught sight of her again and were able to finally order. We placed our order for new drinks (had been empty for some time), appetizers, and our main course all at once. 

Main courses (crawfish and king crab) arrived before the appetizers (charred oysters) which showed up right after we opened our boil bags. This was weird, and it made it hard to enjoy everything while it was still warm. Three of the six charred oysters were SALTY. SO SALTY. Lip-puckering salty. This was also weird, and we wouldn't order them again. The crab and crawfish were both amazingly delicious.

I feel it important to note that our waitress didn't bring us the food or drinks - it was done so by other servers and/or kitchen staff. We didn't see her again until long after dinner and wash-up when we had to flag her down and ask for our check . When she returned, she handed me the check and said, \"Here you go\" and tried to turn quickly to walk away but I called her back as I already had my credit card in my hand and ready to send.

We tipped 10% - the lowest we ever do - to reflect our disappointment in her service. As we were standing to leave, she swooped in and grabbed the check to open and look at it in front of us (how crass) and then, glaring, and in the most condescending voice I've ever heard, said, \"THANK you! Have a GREAT evening...\"

We thought about stopping and talking to a manager on the way out to relay our experience, but they were still really busy, and we were on our way somewhere else. It'll probably be a while, but we'll definitely go back and give them another shot at some point.

TL;DR - 5 star atmosphere, 5 star main courses, 2 star appetizers, 1 star service."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh food, amazing beer selections.  Yes, it's true, most of the food is fried and probably unhealthy as all get out-but who cares when it tastes this good?
I had the soft shelled crab, and my friend had fish and chips.  DELICIOUS.  Well, maybe the coleslaw could use a new recipe...but the potato salad made up for it."}
{"text":"The only angry about this place is the feeling I left with....overpaying for a mediocre dining experience. 

The place looks likes it was once a red lobster which was then converted to the new and not improved Angry Crab Shack. 

Don't waste your time - the seafood isn't fresh, it's tasteless and it's overpriced. Additionally, I needed a manual to understand all of the gimmicky sauces/styles in which to order my seafood selections.

Only reason for giving this joint a star was due to the waitress being friendly and punctual."}
{"text":"Couldn't stop eating my catfish bag of goodness. The sauce and all the ingredients in the bag just gave a wonderful experience for my taste buds.  

I was an awful date. I didn't say a word, I just ate the whole time. It was so good that I bit into my plastic fork and didn't care about eating a chunk of plastic, because the sauce was so good. 

Can't wait for the new location in Ahwatukee to open... This a fun culinary experience."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Try the dry rub wings with the trifecta rub. You will not be disappointed. The food was great, service (we had Traycee) was friendly and helpful. We will be back. Nice to have fresh seafood in the west valley."}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat! It's a unique atmosphere with great service and most importantly, 10/10 food. The menu is simple but has a lot of options. I would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas and the best restaurant crawfish is at Razoos and the prices are much better. Angry crab is subpar. My husband and I will order our crawfish bring them home & doctor them up! The trifecta seasoning is okay but they simply lack flavor. You have to add loads of seasoning including salt."}
{"text":"I have officially found my new go to for crab and oysters!  Prices are reasonable,  selection is broad and the spice was amazing (for those who can handle it)!!  Left very very satisfied. :-)"}
{"text":"Thanks for changing my life and making me believe in fresh seafood of the non sushi variety in AZ.  Better than what I even had when visiting the gulf really."}
{"text":"East coast seafood guy so pretty picky. I have not found great seafood anywhere in the valley unless I cooked it myself. 
I have to say this place was great. Very much crab house atmosphere so don't  expect anything fancy and plan to get messy. In my years of chowing down on crabs, lobster, etc. I've never donned a bib until this. The seasoning is different from anything I've ever had but excellent. I chose the trifecta with a heat level of 2. I like very spicy which this was not but it was perfect. I had the spice on dungennous crab, shrimp and mussels. My wife had king crab. After bushels and bushels of blue crab, soft crab and other in my life, this crab was the best I've ever had hands down. It was full and sweet and cooked perfectly. We also had hush puppies, corn and red potatoe. I can't wait to go back and dive into another one of these babies.
Our server was busy but didn't miss a beat. Natasha was friendly accommodating and handled all of her tables well. Especially considering all the explaining they have to do for seafood newbies and to navigate the menu. 
Now the prices aren't cheap but the value is good. Well worth it. Except if you ask for butter you get charged. A dollar. Really guys? I'm paying $45 for a crab and $25 for king crab. Throw in the butter. My only other negative is that you can't order 1/2 pound of mussels, clams, or shrimp. These would make a perfect add on to larger items and if you did 1/2 pound orders you might sell a few more. 
Other wise we're going back. Fun place and great food. We'll sneak in our own butter though!"}
{"text":"Snow crab! Shrimp! Catfish! All of it is crazy good. I don't know what Matt's position is but he has the best attitude. I eat at all the locations frequently. I love it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Tasty! Get the crab legs .. they won't disappoint. I didn't love the clams (were a bit rubbery) but I think that's what you have to expect living in Arizona.... the atmosphere is fun and inviting with an eclectic crowd of people. It's great to come here with groups or even grab a beer at the bar by yourself and munch of some tasty crab legs! Definitely one of my favorite spots in the area!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! I ordered the king crab and snow crab legs trifecta level III and I enjoyed every bite of it! Not to mention I loved my bartender/ server. you have to ask for her!  I'm pretty sure her name was Ally. Can't wait to go again! The oysters looked pretty good to"}
{"text":"Was there like 10 min ago and order 10 pound of crawfish.the sause was ok but the quality of crawfiish was worst then a buffet. Meat was so pasty dont get me wrong.not all but 80 percent of it was bad and 20 was good and to many egg underneat the crawfish make it so nasty.my girl actually scream when she saw it.i ate 3 out of 10 piece and throw the other away what a waste but I cant even eat it.cant believe I drove 45.min for this  now have to drop by to another restaurant gezzzz."}
{"text":"Holy HELL get yourself to this place!  Loved everything about it.  Messy, fun, fresh and freaking delicious."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place and I am not a sea food eater but they have a few options for people like me. It also has a very laid back atmosphere. I have always had really nice servers that have never neglected us ( there is usually one in the bunch) last time we went my husband was obnoxious and asked for samples of all the beers on tap, Evan said, \"sure!\" The prices aren't cheap but there not expensive either."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, who knew it existed??! Has fresh seafood just like youd get in Louisiana. It can be spicy as it's a Cajun place so beware how spicy you get it.  I recommend snow crabs, clams, shrimp and Cajun fries.  I got a bloody mary...yum, this is a must get! There's no other place like this in AZ what a find! Don't let the outside fool you!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time took our two year old and my picky half. It was loud enough to drown out her very busy mouth and food was delicious for someone who loves BBQ and hates sea food and vise versa! We had the best of both worlds!"}
{"text":"Rick was awesome!! He loves his job! It was awesome! Food was delish and fast and messy! Lots of fun!!"}
{"text":"We were visiting the area and we're looking for something interesting. And this place didn't disappoint! Louisiana-style seafood by the pound with great seasonings and BBQ selections. We brought our toddler with us and he had some fun too (just don't get the Mac and cheese for little ones - it has jalapeños in it!). My only criticism would be that there are no prices on the menu for main dishes (ours were about $13/pound, but I understand that they might vary) and you can't get food by the 1/2 pound."}
{"text":"This is an absolutely amazing seafood place in Arizona. I come from the east coast and I've been trying to find a place like this ever since I've been here (2 years). Hot N Juicy Craw Fish has similar a menu and style but Angry Crab is hands down by far the best. You get bigger shrimp, great customer service, awesome atmosphere, and absolutely amazing taste. The Trifecta hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Not that I'm against it.....but I wish someone would have told me no utensils no plates. Giiiirls wait to get yo' full set for after you come here, and don't wear white!  

The spice is great. Kinda strange getting lobster in a plastic bag......but when in Rome! Enjoy. Also I loooove spicy and the level 3 is hawt so beware! 

Crab was cooked perfectly, not sure how I feel cutting it with scissors like I'm crafting some perfect origami crane crab scrapbook page but again....when in Rome!"}
{"text":"First time here. Seafood was great!! King Crab legs and Snow Crab legs. Shannon our server was patient and very knowledgable. It is a messy meal, but that is part of the fun. If you can, save some room for the cheesecake!!"}
{"text":"The food, service, and atmosphere were amazing! Our favorites of the night were the hush puppies and the cajun/garlic crab. Total we tried the hush puppies, trifecta crab, cajun/garlic shirmp and crab, gator bites, char'd oysters with the fixin's: sausage, corn, potatoes, and potato salad."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Food came out so fast.  Their shrimp was perfect. Theyre sausage was amazing! The only thing that i wasnt to impressed with was there steamed rice. It was a little dry but other than that it was absolutely amazing. My husband had fried catfish and he was definitely satisfied. And he is very hard to please. We will definitely be returning here.
And to be clear it is was better than boiling crab."}
{"text":"It was my 1st experience with a crab boil ever, so I leaned on friend's advice on which way to go, I knew I wanted Snow Crab and with great help I went with the trifecta level 2, now this had some great flavor man it was delish, but next time I think I will kick it up a bit and try the heat level 3.

It was one pound of Snow Crab at market price, which at that time was 15 bucks, honestly that's not bad at all if you think about how much a good meal would cost you elsewhere.  The Snow Crab was cooked perfectly, it was so juicy and tender I was very sad to see I ate it all it was that good!

I also added an order of hush puppies, that was some fried up goodness right there and tried out there bbq beans, those were not the most pretties to look at but it made up in flavor for sure, before I knew it. it was gone.

The Angry Crab was a great dinner choice, look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Thought we'd try this place out as the parking lot is always crowded.   The casual atmosphere is fun.  Music s so loud you have to yell at your table. The food comes as it is ready not as a whole table. Food quality nothing to be excited about.  Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon before it got too busy. Had a chance to hang out at the bar while waiting for the fam to arrive. Great spot to chill. The bartenders were friendly and sociable.  I'd happily come back here to catch a game on their TV screens. 

Once the fam arrived we were seated pretty quickly. Our server was informative and had good recommendations. Our group ordered a combination of shrimp, crawfish, king crab legs and oysters, all soaked in their recommend sauce (I think it was called the Trifecta?). Everything, especially the oysters and crawfish, was delicious. Expect to get messy, as you will be using your hands a lot. Luckily, they have a sink along one of the walls where you can wash your hands. 

Didn't get a chance to try their crab, but will have to go back earlier in the week cuz apparently they tend to sell out by Sunday (which is probably a good sign!). Everything else was great. Would go back again."}
{"text":"Seafood done the right way .. Crazy good as mild or as spicy as you want it . They also have BBQ which is smoked on site and it is some of the best BBQ to hit the Valley. Famous who?? Something for everyone and you can write on the walls . Don't worry about getting dirty there is bibs and sinks to clean up ."}
{"text":"Great food however service was terrible; food was served about 15-20 min apart, never asked if refills were needed, and the attitude from the server and manager was not needed. The group next to us seemed to have the same problem but the manager kept blaming the server. We'll try a different location next time."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Tammy our server was very nice however the food was less than memorable! We ordered 2lbs live crawfish with lobster and when they came out they were awful!!  They had none of the seasoning on them and the bag was so filled with water which led me to believe they sold us frozen crawfish at the live price. Then we showed Tammy how watery they were and she brought us two side of diff spices and actually charged us for one of them! We were not impressed and totally disappointed! If you want the same style seafood but better taste go to HOT AND JUICY in Tempe!!! We will not be going back....waste of money!!"}
{"text":"The pick and peel had the head on it  it was ok then ordered blue crab and it was like water . I'm from New York so a bit pictuilair with food and I ordered clam strips they put old bay on them told them old bay on the side waitress and major had bad attitudes"}
{"text":"I'm an angry crab for not trying this place sooner! This place rocks! Shared some hush puppies and a trifecta heat 2 bag of mussels and snow crab legs with corn and sausage with my man tonight. Although, it was a little too spicy for him and he broke a sweat, I on the other hand didn't and couldn't get enough of that delicious concoction,  licked my fingers after every bite! 


Love the whole atmosphere of Angry Crab from the music to the writings on the wall. You will get messy, so don't wear your Sundays best, but if you do, they have bibs for you! I also saw a couple with gloves on, but I'm not sure if they brought their own or if Angry Crab supplies them, but we went the traditional way and got full on messy! 

Great service, and seems like everyone there enjoys their job, which makes it more enjoyable for the guest, too! 

Thanks again for our fantastic date night! We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"The only reason I give it a 4 is kitchen was really slow...   server however rocked it and made sure we were well taken care of.   Freshest seafood in the valley!"}
{"text":"My dining companion ordered the 2-lb dungeness crab.  Pretty pricey at $34, but that's what's expected when eating seafood in the middle of the desert. I would say the crab was worth that $30, it was delicious and the meat was sweet. It was kind of strange that the server didn't automatically bring out tools to open the crab with, not sure if she expected us to just use hands?  She eventually brought us out the claw-breaker tool, but I wish they also had those plastic tools you can use to cut the shell open.

I ordered the crawfish.  It was pretty good, although there were 3-4 crawfish in my bunch that were \"bad\" that I couldn't eat.  I wish they would've weeded those ones out.

Overall, I would come back again, since there are very few places in Phoenix to go to for good fresh seafood.

oh, and I have to add that I really liked the oysters they served, they were quite large! and very tasty.

I also like that they have the hand-washing station outside of the bathroom since you know everyone's going to get really dirty hands when eating this seafood."}
{"text":"To start, our server was so friendly and accommodating to a large group of people, so kudos for that!  also, there's lots of TVs here, so it's a good spot to watch sports and grab a meal.

As for the food, it was all just regular for me.  I ordered the soft shell crab basket that comes with cajun fries and your choice of additional side.  I definitely could have eaten just that basket and been full.  The soft shell crab was decent, although I could do with a little less breading.  Not a lot of meat on it, but that's to be expected.

I also ordered a pound of the frozen crawfish.  Eesh, that was a mistake.  I didn't really know the difference between frozen and live, but I tried one of my friend's \"live\" crawfish and it was SO. MUCH. BETTER.  my crawfish had a really funky taste to them.  On top of that, I thought the trifecta medium hot sauce was a little bland.  It definitely needed more salt and more heat.  so lesson learned, there IS a difference between frozen and live, and always order the live crawfish.  however, the \"frozen\" crawfish were a lot larger than the live crawfish.

One nice touch is that they give you free cheesecake if it's your bday!

I think my favorite part of my meal was the Cajun fries... I've had better boiled seafood at other places, so I would not be that likely to come here again..."}
{"text":"My dad and I have come here for a cup of gumbo all the time since this location opened, but we probably wont be coming back. Since opening, the quality of this restaurant and its service had declined significantly. Tonight we came in to super sticky floors everywhere we walked and it took is 10 minutes to even get an order put in, though our waitress kept coming by to help the table next to us and making eye contact with us. It took extra long for my dad's beer to come out and when we reminded them, they dropped off a beer can on the table (no glass, and they didnt say a word) and ran off to help someone else. The bread they bring out always tastes lukewarm and stale, as though they quickly microwaved the loaf. It's hard to pull apart and hasnt tasted fresh since we first came in around opening. The gumbo tonight wasnt the best quality either- as avid fans of it, we were both seriously disappointed. Neither of us could finish because the taste was dull and unappetizing. We are both super bummed because this was our favorite place to stop for a quick, delicious dinner, but after tonight, we've decided we'll be taking our gumbo needs elsewhere.

Update: Since posting this review, we still haven't gotten our check and its been about 20 minutes since we finished eating. The restaurant is only about half full, so I dont know what the slow service is due to. There are waiters checking on everyone else... When we first came here, the service was the fastest we've ever seen, so now we're just disappointed and confused."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, this is our 2nd time in 2 weeks coming here. The bloody marys were great and so was the bbq. Our server Hannah was awesome and they even realized that we were into watching AVP volleyball finals on tv so they put it on the big screen for us! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Ok, this place made me so happy!! First off, our server Susie was amazing... AMAZING!!  I left there wondering if she was single and if I could set her up with my dad... Anywho... We ordered snow crab legs with the (trifecta??) seasoning, delicious!! We also got the oysters, which were outstanding and the gators bites which were very good!! An overall delicious and FUN experience, not cheap but well worth it.. Can't wait to go again!!"}
{"text":"Came for my friends birthday and had so much fun. Food was perfect and the service was great. We even had to grab the manager and tell him how great Deb our server was :)"}
{"text":"That fish cray.

You know, as in crayfish?  Okay, sorry, that was lame.  Anyways!

This is a looong overdue update.  Since my review in July of '14, I've popped in a handful more times and I gotta say, wow, I'm a fan now!  Long gone are those grossly oil-filled sauces.  Angry Crab seems to have adapted to using the more brothy type sauce that I love from other crawfish boil restaurants.  I always get the trifecta sauce [mixture of Cajun, Lemon Pepper, and Garlic sauce] either at a level 2 or 3 depending how adventurous I am that day.  The freshness of the shrimp is still questionable to me but I'm usually here for the crawfish only anyways.  And with this location being a mile-and-a-half away from home, I'm on Cloud Nine.  

This place is ran like a well-oiled machine whether you want to order to-go or for dine-in.  The staff is knowledgeable, they'll tell you honestly if their crawfishes are frozen or live, and they're fast!  So pop on in if you want some tasty seafood!

A crawfish has four pair of walking legs and four pair of swimming legs and all of them leads to my belly.  GET IN MY BELLY!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, both times for special occasions.  This is not your typical \"let's celebrate\" place.  This is a place where you arrive in the clothes that you plan to throw out the next day, put away your cellphones (they'll get sauce all over them if you don't), and prepare to smash crabs with rocks and dig into sauce-filled bags of corn, sausage and crab with your bare hands.  It's primitive and it's amazing.  

Trifecta sauce was delicious.  Definitely go mild or one step above mild if you're a spice whimp. The upper levels are killers.  As weird as it seems, pay the extra buck or two in order to add corn and sausage to your bag.  It's delicious.

If you're looking to take someone on a date, but you want to do something slightly non-traditional and also test how chill your potential partner is, I'd highly suggest Angry Crab Shack.  Great way to filter through those Tinder options."}
{"text":"Had the best time at Angry Crab but I've never had great service until Steph helped us out. She was great, I'll be back again because of steph and hope to get her as my waitress again!! Lovely time! Thanks steph!"}
{"text":"If you like seafood you owe it to your self to go here. It can get a little pricey but it is well worth it. Everything about this place is winning. Staff, atmosphere, its a little tight to navigate through the restaurant especially if you're a bigger guy like me but the food is so good I would crawl through a mound of fire ants to get to a table just to eat here. 

The sauces are great, I usually get the milder sauce in the bag with the seafood and the hotter sauce on the side, trust me, the heat sneaks up on you. I always get some corn, a few potatoes, and a couple pieces of sausage tossed in to one of the bags. If you are a picky eater or don't like getting messy, this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"My family and I went last night and let me just say this is my new favorite restaurant to eat crab at. It completely blows Joe's Crab Shack out of the water!! Franky was our waitress and she was the absolute best, she was so attentive and always made sure we were taken car of. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"After hearing good reviews from friends it was time to try it out, friendly greeting as soon as we walked in the door and from any other staff member we made eye contact with. We were seated immediately,  our drinks came out shortly after and as busy as it was in a very timely manner. Now for the food, frickin AMAZING!!!!! Not only is their style of steam bags unlike any you find on the western hemisphere, the steam bags came out with whole seafood in them, I got shrimp, blue crab, and crawfish, my girlfriend got king crab. I love whole, head on seafood, all the flavor is in the head, I was a head sucking fool tonight. So in other words, get there and eat, eat like you mean it, eat like its your last meal, you will not be disappointed. Thank you for a wonderful great experience,  see yall soon."}
{"text":"Really interesting place for a guy like me that comes from the Midwest. You basically order by the pound and they put everything you want into a bag for you to eat (very messily) out of. Be sure to order a lot and bring a fat wallet. Our server was super knowledgable and helpful, she even showed us how to break open the lobster we ordered. It was a fun time."}
{"text":"Our first visit to The Angry Crab was in Peoria and our experience was fantastic! So when we found out there was another location right by our work, my husband and I were thrilled! So we decided to go after work on 12/30/2016 around 6pm. It was fairly busy but nothing out of the ordinary, we didn't even have to wait to be seated. We were greeted with a friendly face, Mary, who said this location is \"way better than the one on Cactus!\" We we're excited to hear that because this is the one we would most likely be going back to, since it's so close. We ordered the half dozen raw oysters first. Then the King Crab with veggies, corn on the cob, sausage and \"bread for soppin'\".  This was all ordered at the same time. 

After about a 5 minute wait, the bread was brought out. We waited to eat the bread about 5-10 more mins before we decided to nibble on the bread - still waiting on the half dozen of oysters to come out. Our waitress never addressed the issue as of yet. Then another waitress brought out the bags of King Crab and veggies, not sealed as they were at the Cactus location. My husband asked the woman who was not our waitress to check on our raw oysters we had ordered over 25 mins ago. When our server came back to check on us, she didn't even notice that we never got the oysters, and when asked about them she assumed we ordered the fried oysters. No, we ordered just the plain old raw oysters that typically take about 5 mins to get to the table, normally. She came back and said it's really busy back there and will take a couple more mins. At this point we decided to go ahead and start eating our King Crab. Imagine the surprise when my husband took the first bite and felt the crunch of ice at the center of the Crab Meat that we paid $28/lb for. Making any illusion of \"freshness\" now debunked. When we told our waitress, she didn't really seemed surprised, and asked if we wanted to re-heat the Crab or order new. Which I thought went without saying. Mind you, at this point, we still have not received our half dozen raw oysters. Also, a manager has not visited our table at all, as of yet. She then picks up our Crab from the table and disappears.  So we eat our semi-hot veggies for another 10 mins or so. Then our hot King Crab came out, almost over cooked, but at least cooked. *STILL NO OYSTERS* we start eating the crab meat and about 3-5 minutes later the oysters finally came out, a little slimy, so we are a little worried about eating them as well.

Our experience was one of the worst experiences I've ever had. Especially for the kind of money we were spending. 

No manager ever came over to apologize. No part of the meal comped, but we did get a free desert to take home with us. Thanks. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely outrageously delicious! We got there early (a few minutes before 5pm) so we beat the dinner rush and were seated immediately. There were 4 adults and 1 child in our party. For appetizers we ordered: Fried Clams and Hush Puppies. For dinner we ordered: Dungeness Crab (it was 2.5 pounds!),  Blue Crab, Clams and Shrimp and put it all in the middle of the table and shared. Since it was our first time we just went with the house seasoning on everything and ordered it mild. Absolutely everything was out of this world tasty and beyond our highest hopes! Super fresh! We had a hard time cracking our dungeness open and one of the servers came by and helped us with that. This is a messy, butcher paper on the table, noisy, family friendly, plastic bib provided, eating at a picnic table, throw your shells in a bucket, fresh-off-the-airplane-fresh-seafood restaurant. The food just shows up at your table once it is cooked; a server will come by with a plastic bag filled with your order and plunk it down. And for those of you parents out there - yes, they have chicken strips and fries and they were tasty according to our very picky 5 year old. We spent $147 with tax and a 20% tip, which we thought was very reasonable for all of the food that we stuffed ourselves on and the beer, wine and tea. There are a couple of sinks to use to hose yourself off when you are done which was very handy too! I am from the west coast and the other 3 adults were from the east coast, so we definitely are aware of what good seafood is (hence the blue crab vs. dungeness order) and we all place our seal of approval on this place!"}
{"text":"We just ate there food over price and side food was terrible... We spent $40. For the two of us n went home hungry... The little corn was watery n very soft no taste to it... The rice was cold .. Crab legs was good but over priced .. Could of went to red lobster got crab legs salad n bake potatoe for less.... The cole slaw was unbeatable.... Sorry won't be back!!"}
{"text":"I went here this past weekend just to relax and eat out with some friends. This is my first time trying out this place. I love the environment, it is very spacious and clean. There's a big sink in the corner where you can wash your hands instead of going to the bathroom, which was very nice. They have wooden wall for you to write and doodle.  I like the big screen TVs in all corners so you can watch the games and enjoy good foods. 

Talking about the food, we ordered oysters, Cajun fries, snow crab, craw fish and shrimps. They have 1-5 spice levels, we went with 4. I love the spice level and the sauce was great, but I feel like it wasn't marinate long enough. It taste good on the outside but it taste so bland on the inside. So what I did was peel all the shrimps and craw fish and soak in the sauce for 2 or 3 mins before I eat them. Cajun fries, I expected a lot more than just a tiny basket. 

About the service, he was nice but it takes him a long time to take our orders and get our drinks out. I think he try to be funny and I know a lot of server want to have that connection with the customers but sometimes it can be overboard and offensive to others. 

I wouldn't return or recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Awesome seafood and super tasty cajun fries.  They have good, homemade ranch (important), not the gross bottled stuff.  Their BBQ sauce is very flavorful.  They offer head off shrimp for $2 extra.  They don't always tell you when you order - less work for you.  Such a fun concept.  I am so glad they opened at this location after several failed restaurants.  It gets very busy later in the evenings, especially on weekends.  Prepare to wait and circle repeatedly for parking.  Also, incredible service.  Everyone is so nice and welcoming,  Everytime I've been in, several different people have checked in with us and asked if we needed anything.  Go eat here!"}
{"text":"Okay so I've been here a few times thought a review might be in order. First off the times I've been here in the past I've come during a rush hour when there is a wait. This time was one of those twilight hours between the lunch rush and the friday dinner crowd. With that said, this time there was no wait. Not even a full restaurant from start to finish of our meal. Got a booth, so nice and roomy especially for a messy meal to come...

It's happy hour when we arrive so dollar off drafts , wines and cocktails something like that our server didn't even know. Train your servers people cmon.

Booth behind us was getting a lot of attention from all the servers must of been some one they know or an off duty employee. But the table was annoying loud and kept banging on the booth like a 2 year old. Grow up. But still Not the point I'm trying to make. We get it... you know/probably work there act like it if you are representing the business. I've been in the industry yeah we goofed off and made noise on our off days we decided to come in. But it's Just bad juju.

As for the food. Always great. No complaints here. You see from the other reviews it is legit seafood bag boil with you choice of spices, heat level and sides. The raw oysters went up in price understandable, still a solid appetizer. And I've also had the crawfish poboy which is damn good. Takes the hassle of harvesting those lil guys in a sandwich.

Now here's my main complaint. It's friday I get it. You're a new server I get it. But if I'm still eating and have my hands covered in delicious trifecta sauce. Don't fully bus my table, butcher paper and all while i have the last delicious shrimp in my hands, so I'm having to  grab my phone,  sunglasses and keys outta the way so you can 'turn and burn this table' or whatever was running thru your mind.

I'll come back here, I will. Don't get me wrong but as for most yelp reviews, you get the bad in this case the service and the good the seafood boil. Three solid stars here. Four if not five if the service was there. It's the little things sometimes. Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE! The food is enormous and delicious! It's behind pricey but it's worth it since it's so yummy! Our server was also very nice! She was funny and her sense of humor was wonderful! I forgot her name but she was still new in the restaurant as a server but she did great. Kudos to her. I love the vibrancy or this place & the spices they have taste so good! Totally recommending this place to my friends and family & as well as the public. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Waited for almost 15 min after being seated... No one spoke to me or even took my drink order while others were seated and drinks were brought to them. No thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"idk if i would come back but i can say that the service was great. our waiter was so friendly and i enjoyed talking to him. he explained how to order from the menu v well and i got the snow crab legs. the top two things that took away from the stars is the sauces (wasn't very impressed with mine) and some of the random people that just come onto the restaurants property to smoke."}
{"text":"Today we first got a waitress who, when she came to greet us, wasn't fully paying attention. She took our drink orders and never came back. Which was actually fine in the end, so she gets 0 stars.

That turned out to be a blessing because we got a guy who only recently started but was far better than the original girl. He was personable, knew the menu for the most part ( there was uncertainty about the sweet potato fries replacing two sides), was funny, and came back many times for refills studio we didn't when go empty on drinks.

He gets the 5 stars. I think his name was Glen maybe. Not that it matters, but if you want to get him, he was an African American young fellow. Most other servers were girls that night it seemed.

Of course it's always noisy in here. 

But the food is great. Love the hand washing station so you don't have to use the restroom to just wash your hands."}
{"text":"We had a really nice time here but I had to give it only three stars because our crab was so not fresh and tasted super fishy! Of course that was the main thing we were excited about going for and it was a huge disappointment. However we really enjoyed the shrimp with the head cut off as well as the trifecta sauce level III. The two didn't have much spice at all so I recommend the three if you want some kick! Definitely add the sausage and potato to your order they're super cheap but very good! I also like that their beer prices were pretty good even off of happy hour. They probably lost a little money from us with how long they took to bring the beers out ... probably would have had four instead of the two we ordered  We will definitely go back but stay away from the gross crab.  A fun dining experience!

Update: Been back plenty of times once we got the hang of this place down and now it's our absolute favorite place to eat... so addicting. Now we just order the shrimp with the heads off in the trifecta sauce with potatoes and sausage. Plus we sit at the bar and the service has been amazing!!! We love this place now!!"}
{"text":"Okay so I felt like 2 stars was too little but 3 was too much. I went with 2 because I love their food!! This was first time I've been to this location, however, and I have to tell you I was highly disappointed with the service we received. Usually I'm very forgiving when it comes to service around food but this was very bad. First, the waiter instantly was rude. It was so strange because I've never been approached with that kind of service. My cousin asked him a question about the crab and his replies were short and almost as if he was annoyed. Then it was a little warm in there so I asked if it was possible for us to sit outside. We had just ordered our food so only had our drinks at the table so I didn't think it was a big deal specially because we were at the table right in front of the patio door... the waiter once again replied annoyed \"We don't have any servers working outside\". ??? Oh I didn't know the 5 extra steps he would have to take would make that big of a difference. We got our food, it was delicious! No complaint there. Finished then bill time... paid in cash and that was a mistake. The guy gave me a $5 and a $20. Really?!? You couldn't break the $20 bill down so I could give you the right tip. I can tell you one thing for sure... I will never go to this location again and will definitely tell anyone I know not to either. I will go out of my way for their other locations now. Sucks!"}
{"text":"Waited for what seemed like an eternity for someone to even acknowledge our presence. When no one came, took the matters in our own hands and left. Never again! Angry Crab, you made me hangry!"}
{"text":"A little sloppy when you eat but overall very good food good service and like I said hella good food WAY BETTER than idiot Joe Crap Shack trust me you'll know da difference thank you Angry Crab Shack"}
{"text":"Good seafood, nothing spectacular. Excellent waiter and staff. A more exciting menu would make it excellent with 5 stars."}
{"text":"good seafood place! this is a place to get messy with seafood. they offer different seafood and bbq in their menu. for those who like to have some drinks...you can also enjoy happy hour here. service is really good and staff are helpful and friendly. overall, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is the best! Affordable and just like eating back east. Make sure you sit in Mack's section. Don't move away!"}
{"text":"Yes- it's a long wait time if you going during the \"normal dinner times\", but they are quick to get you seated as soon as possible. The service is always fast and direct. 

We love the snow crab here. We always add corn, potatoes, and the sausage. Don't forget the bread to sop up the sauce!!

Tips:
Fold up the white table paper so the sauce doesn't run into your lap.
You eat everything by hand, so don't wear white even though they provide plastic bibs. 
Their Medium is more of a hot, Hot is x-tra hot etc. 
Shrimp and Crawdads come with the heads/eyes and all."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Jordann was our waitress very informative and perky. I had the 2 meat BBQ. The meat was cooked perfectly, but lacked the seasoning. You actually needed BBQ sauce for the seasoning. The coleslaw was a little dry but good. The BBQ beans was very good.
Very good experience, would recommend to friends."}
{"text":"This is such a fantastic place to take a date! Maybe not a first date, but it would be a great dinner for a 3rd date or beyond. It's dinner and a bit of entertainment!

Here's the low down: Shellfish is ordered by the pound. You pick the flavoring and degree of heat. A while later the food arrives in bags and is unceremoniously dumped onto the table. There are no plates and cutlery isn't generally offered. You'll peel and crack everything yourself. It's a LOT of work, but it's a fun time with a group of friends or a chance to get down and dirty with a date.

We've visited on 4 different occasions, and most of the time they have a lengthy wait for a table. During the hotter months they come by with cold water and slices of watermelon for those standing by. Very considerate!

One last tip...don't forget to bring a breath mint!"}
{"text":"I got a pnd of shrimp w a potatoe sausage corn. And pnd of snow crab. I got the trifecta spice level 3....it was hot, but ill do that one again.  soppin bread is a MUST. LOVED it all. The Mule was refreshing. The Service was superb, went on a fruday at 5pm, barely made it b4 the dinner crowd, were seated immediately."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good thing about this restaurant. I've been here many times. 3 times this week. I love the shrimp and king crab legs. I have mine spicy with the trifecta and # 3 sauce. That what I get every time and it's perfect. Service is greatest and so are the prices."}
{"text":"I absolutely hate having to writing this review. I brought my kids here to celebrate my daughter's birthday. I have been wanting to go to this place since it opened but since moving 45 mins away it was impossible.  So when she picked to go here, I was more excited than her. I was born in Louisiana and grew up eating crawfish for every single celebratory occasion. My dad flies in crawfish from Louisiana every few months for a family crawfish boil in California. I can eat copious amounts of crawfish without batting an eye.
 
First we were seated, our drink orders were taken and given and then the wait of approximately 8-10 mins before the hostess had to grab our server who turned out to be the bar tender as well. It was a strange set up, however, she was very accommodating.  Server apologized for the wait, took our order and asked if we wanted certain things to come out first and I replied, no please have everything come out at the same time.
 
We ordered 1 lb of crawfish spice level 2/trifecta, the cheese burger burger, fried shrimp with BBQ beans and gator nuggets.  All of our food came out 5 mins apart and my son's burger came out dead last 15 mins after the first order of the crawfish came out. My kids enjoyed their meal while me on the other hand- utter disappointment. I could only stomach eating 8-10 crawfish before I closed up the bag and decided to eat the gator nuggets to fill me up. The crawfish seasoning was ON POINT, however, the meat was tasteless, mushy and I can put money on the fact that it was frozen not live. There is no way that was fresh unless it was alive when it came in and died a few days before it was boiled. My heart was literally broken that I didn't enjoy my meal and taste my childhood. The gator nuggets were dry so I drenched it in sauce before I ate it and I tried my daughter's BBQ beans and they were actually good.
 
Rating:
Food: 1
Service: 3- Don't worry yelpers- I still tipped her 20%.
 
If I come back, it would only be to walk by to smell the deceiving scent in the air and wait for my trips home to eat the real thing."}
{"text":"Went to angry crab last night. They have the best seafood in Phoenix! The food was amazing. Our service was great, and it seemed like the whole staff was very diligent to make sure we had a good time. Jacob was our server and he even bought us a t-shirt. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is really great. Has awesome fresh seafood. Its moderately priced, but completely worth it for the quality of food being served. I'll definitely go back again."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd try here. Always a long wait. Many empty tables but still a wait. This restaurant has ruined 3 nights of mine and no more for me. Staff standing around talking, empty tables. No one knows how much longer to sit down and eat. Not enough staff, long waits, food decent. No more for me. Each time think it's going to be better... not so. What a shame. Any restaurant w 1/3 empty tables and hosts standing around playing like children is not worth my business for 4th time."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!! people are crazy if they don't think this is good!! i am a die hard fan of hot n juicy crawfish in west hollywood, CA and honestly this place is just as good!! Boiling crab sucks and this place is definitely better than them!! A MUST TRY :)"}
{"text":"Good seafood in the heart of Phoenix! My second visit in a week. Great sauces/seasonings, sizable/plump crab (king and snow)!
Atmosphere is casual, especially during the day.
Everything both visits was perfectly steamed except the shrimp . Had the shrimp my 2nd visit. The shrimp was slightly over cooked and therefore very hard to shell and a little chewy, but def still edible.
Mussels were right on point and the oysters were large and fresh.
All in all a very good experience both times. 
Would recommend to anyone that happens to find themselves in central Phx, jonesing for good seafood without the pretensions of the Biltmore area."}
{"text":"I've never tried the boiling crab in Cali, so I can't compare this place to that like many others can. but as for my first seafood boil experience... AMAZING! the seafood was fresh and everything was huge and didn't taste fishy or old. We got 1lb shrimp, 2lb snow crabs, 1lb mussels, order or oysters, and Cajun fries and my boyfriend and I had the biggest and best feast ever! all were seasoned with trifecta spicy level hot and omg delicious. service was great and food came out fast. love it!"}
{"text":"VERY LOUD. Had to yell to be heard. Tasty food, but overwhelming with the noise level. I'm glad I didn't bring my daughter because she would have been in seizure city. I don't remember what I ordered, but I was happy, lol."}
{"text":"Today was my bday. I had a horrible night and was trying to meet my family for dinner. We walked in very late to the restaurant and asked if they would still be willing to serve us because it's so late, we asked \"are you sure you want to seat us? \" They were so friendly, especially Dil, our server. He actually made me smile after the evening I had. Food was good and they cheered for my bday. We left the restaurant well after they had closed, and there were 2 other tables who had packed up right before us as well as another birthday, so it just seemed like a later night for the restaurant in general. On top of the 20%, we tipped them an extra cash tip as well to say thank you for staying late.  Little did some of the staff know  that we heard them call us motherfuckers as we left \"those motherfuckers are finally leaving\"... and they fake smiled and said happy birthday to me while they had just called my family motherfuckers. So thanks angry crab for a mediocre dinner. Next time tell people \"no\" if you dont want to serve them late. I have worked in lots of places and regardless, i have always maintained professionalism. Tell your staff to be more professional and pay them well so it is worth their while to take care of the customer. I am glad I still got a birthday dinner..  but yes my motherfucker family and I will go elsewhere for my next birthday. Thanks..."}
{"text":"Went w a party of 20. The service was good, the waitress could have been a little polite. I get its a big table but it's your job. The food was on point, got the crab legs, traditional boil. Perfect. The potatoes were done well. The overall experience was fantastic, the whole gang loved it. The alligator bite were great, the fried oyster was gross. Not a fan of oysters to big w and even less of one with them fried. Amazing to see a whole lobster served in a bag. Good food, good times."}
{"text":"Yum and Yum and Yum. So many varied and delicious choices of shellfish and New Orleans' style sammies too. We had shrimp and crab and mussels and couldn't be happier. This place is messy, so don't wear your finest. Be casual and enjoy the most delicious boil of your life. The beer is Abita and it's cold too."}
{"text":"Fun and casual spot.  Great place to have a beer and get primal cracking open shellfish with your bare hands.  Friendly servers.  Get the trifecta seasoning with medium spice.  Be sure you understand the amount you are ordering.  It is easy to over-order.  We had lobster, shrimp and king crab.  AMAZING!  Also had corn and sausage with it.  Jeff was a great server!"}
{"text":"I went here with my whole family about a week ago to celebrate my Mom's birthday. She loves seafood and wanted to go someplace casual so that we could bring my sisters' kids along without stress. I had been to Angry Crab Shack before with my hubby and I knew how busy they get on the weekends so we decided to do lunch and it worked out perfect. They don't take reservations but we got a table with no issues. Even though it's not a fancy place, this really is a great option for feeding a crowd at a very reasonable price.

We ordered a ton of food so everyone could get to try different things. A couple people were not too into getting messy but everyone else dug in and ate heartily. I haven't had crawfish since moving away from the gulf coast so that was a real treat. I also tried frog legs for the first time but I didn't care too much for those. My favorite was the snow crab. I got a medium heat level with garlic and Cajun sauces combined. It was d-lish! Everyone else seemed to really enjoy the shrimp. As always their beer selection did not disappoint.

Overall, just a really great experience."}
{"text":"Just not anyplace worth heading to.  The restrooms have a terrible odor.  The server we had was beyond disinterested in us and we're fun people.   Only 3 tables we're occupied while we we're there so being too busy was zero excuse.  Sticky menus.."}
{"text":"I really was excited when they opened  up  and have enjoyed them once or twice until tonight, but when I complained to the owner about the cushion at the table l setting in a
 hole, he was rude, his reply was well move, I had lobster for the first time usually crab, the lobster was was bad, sad but I won't be back. Dont waist your money"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend and his family for my boyfriend's birthday this past Saturday. It was an awesome experience! I am not a seafood fan, so I had the buffalo chicken po' boy with cajun fries. It had coleslaw and tomatoes in it and it was AMAZING, the fries were spectacular! I also had the kajun bloodymary cocktail, which was delicious! My boyfriend had the king crab, spice level 2 and corn on the cob - i had a taste of his and it was a little spicy, but very good. Everyone else had a little bit of everything; blue crab, shrimp, briscuit (which I had a taste of and it was good!), ribs, etc. Everyone was happy with the food and the experience. The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because there were a couple of items on the menu that we wanted to try, the mac & cheese and a cocktail, but neither were being served or had been discontinued - take it off of the menu if it's not available. Other than that, the service was great. It was busy as expected, but our reserved table for 10 was ready at exactly 530 like we requested. The fried foods take a little longer, so if it's busy be prepared to wait. Promise it's worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is fun. The fish was good and the ambiance very casual. You feel like you are near the beach while you eat on picnic tables and have paper place mats. You can buy the crabs, crawfish, or whatever, in bulk so you can take it home to your own party. We stopped by for an early dinner and it wasn't crowded, but I can tell this place rocks on weekends."}
{"text":"This review is a long time coming as I've been here several times, but I'll just add to the other great reviews on here.  Always skeptical of seafood in AZ, this place hooked me the first time.  From the friendly service, delicious seasoning, music, TV's, and believe it or not, how good a Coors light goes down in plastic cups, this place has it all.  Needed in doses to appreciate, it is definitely on our regular rotation every 3-4 weeks.  Glad they are biking distance away, keep it up!"}
{"text":"The family took me here for my birthday.  It was a perfect choice since the granddaughter wanted to draw and they have butcher paper on the tables and plenty of crayons.  The menu and concept is really interesting.  We started with spicy fried clams which I would gave liked tartar sauce for.   I had the lobster with traditional boil and no heat.   It came HUGE in a bag steamed perfectly with a nice amount of heat.   The corn on the cob was good and so was my Big Easy Cocktail.  The hubby had the crab and sausage and enjoyed them. My kids had oyster po'boys wgich were quite ample.  The DIL gad brisket which she declared tender and when sampled made my son want to cry.  It was a nice casual and messy meal for the whole family.  The best part of the night was learning I will be a grandmother again!"}
{"text":"The food was great and so was the service! Kat was awesome! She gave great advice on what to order and really took of us, since it was our first time."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this location, and I must say I'm super impress . The staff here was so friendly. I was greeted with a warm welcome by the hostess, who immediately asked if it was my first time visiting their establishment. The rest of the staff echoed the same warm welcome. Their happiness was so contagious. I fell welcome alright. 
Terri, my waitress was prompt and cheerful.  We had a big dungeness crab, a pound of shrimps, a pound of clams, and some Cajun wings. Everything was delicious. I want to compliment Kat, the manager, and the whole staff for running the place so seemingly. I'm glad I visited this restaurant last night. I will be back for sure.

One side note for the establishment: please purchase better quality rice. The one I had last night was was extremely bad quality. For $2 a serving, I think your customers deserved better."}
{"text":"OMG. I'm in Phoenix for the weekend and took my cousin out for dinner.  We got there about 5:40 and got seated quickly.  When we left, people were outside waiting to be seated.  I understand why, the food is so good, the boil bags are made to anyone's pallet.  The shrimp were huge and tasty.   Beans were fantastic and my cousin loved her Cole slaw and her French Fries.  She lives here locally so she plans going  again and I will be back on another Arizona trip.   The wait staff were really  helpful, especially when it's your first time, explains how it works.  It's  casual  and the prices are so reasonable, wear your bib, dig in, enjoy and they have soap and water to clean yourself.   I think it's great for kids.   Wish there was on in Southern California, I will be back and so will be my cousin."}
{"text":"Oh man love this place what can you say fun, great food,  lively. They have full bar and beers on tap. Eats with your hands and a bib. Not for the clean knife and fork eater for sure. Great place for birthday. Be warned its loud the music the people for me it just makes it a fun place to go and eat foods great. Fun date place highly recommend to try this place you will be back"}
{"text":"As a southeastern coastal girl I LOVE seafood and I'm typically a fan of Joe's crab-shack! BUT I LOOOOOVE this place. Starters the price is right but beyond that the food is amazing and there's multiple locations. The staff is nice. Did I mention the food was amazing? You pick your flavors and extras and how much you want and it's served in a steaming hot bag. I had to convince myself not to order more despite being full. I can't wait to return :)"}
{"text":"1st time to the Angry Crab. Party of 11 and our waiter REALLY took care of us!! I had the King Crab with the trifecta, and the 4th level of heat (ghost), pretty damn hot and really very good! Everyone in our party really enjoyed their food! If your looking for something different when eating your seafood, this is your place. WARNING if anyone in you party is not a seafood eater, all they have is chicken fingers, wings or a buffalo chicken sandwich that is none seafood."}
{"text":"This is a  seafood establishment in the desert. it is fantastic here! service is great ,my bartender/waitress Miranda is fantastic(and she knows her job), very knowledgeable the place is family oriented but gear towards hard-core seafood they have live Dungeness crab live lobster at market price the snow crab was fantastic the king crab was awesome and it was the best king crab ever had even know was my first but it was great my experience was exceptional."}
{"text":"We love this place! For Phx this is the best seafood you can get aside from the coast! Typically the service has always been quite sub par but the food was always worth it! 

Today, we had much friendlier service. Really great service actually from our server, Mimi! Some of the best service we have had in a while!! And surprisingly the rest of the host and food service team was thanking us for coming in or checking to see if there was anything they missed. I'm telling you, if you have tried Angry Crab in the past and didn't like the service, then you should try again! Because O....M.....G.... Great seafood plus Mimi as your server = #foodporn #sogood"}
{"text":"My parents brought me here for lunch a few weeks ago.  We had a boil with crab, shrimp and sausage in a Cajun seasoning.  The food was quite good, the service was fast and friendly and the prices were very fair.  I think the landscaping can be worked on a bit as this restaurant is in the same building as the defunct JB's Restaurant and the outside really shows its age, but over all that's a very minor issue.  This was a good visit and I'm very happy to see dining options like this opening in the far West Valley!"}
{"text":"I was in AZ for couple days for my sisters birthday. I found this place via yelp. We have a few similar restaurants like this here in California that we go to every time she's back home. So finding this place brought us home. Walking in, we got greeted but they were packed but the wait was only about 15 minutes. We got seated at a booth. Our waitress Shelby was super great. 
One of the things I love about this restaurant in Arizona is you have an actual waiter or waitress. Here in California you get seated and have no idea who your waiter or waitress is or even have one. 
She told us about the Monday special which was 2 lb of snow crab legs, mussels, veggies and shrimp.  You choose your flavor and the spice level of your sauce. We got the trifecta sauce which is like 3 sauces in 1. Spice level mild.  We also got an extra pound of shrimp and an extra pound of clams.  Also ordered fried clams and half dozen of chard oysters.  Super good!! Although I wouldn't order the fried clams again, reminded me of mini popcorn chicken.  Only thing I would suggest is adding more sauce in the bags, we felt it was very limited. Thats the only thing.
Shelby always came back to our table to see how we were doing. Partly half way through dinner, her shift ended so David became our new waiter. He was just as great. 
Since it was my sisters birthday, he wished her a happy birthday on a microphone announcing to the entire restaurant. She was utterly embarrassed but it was so worth it.  He then brought her out a slice of cheesecake with a candle. I will be coming back, the next time I am back in Arizona. 

Service 5/5
Cleanliness 5/5
Food 5/5 

& they serve alcohol. 

Everything was just great."}
{"text":"We love the Angry Crab in Mesa--the one on the corner of Alma School and Guadalupe. So, we were pretty excited when an Angry Crab popped up near our home in Central Phoenix. Turns out, we shouldn't have been. I can ignore the one-time disappointing service--the server may have been having a bad day. I can't ignore the fishy smell and rubbery seafood. Clearly my oysters and crab weren't fresh. And, the crab was overcooked. We may go back someday, but I'll remain guarded until they live up to their East Side counterpart."}
{"text":"Love this place come here too much 
If I go alone I sit at the bar. Wonderful service nice bartenders 
If I go with my boyfriend we sit in the dining area servers are super nice too! Usually get snow or king crab and a shrimp basket with the amazing Cajun fries!!! Sangria is on point  only complaint is it's so popular sometimes the wait is long. But it's usually shorter than what they quote me"}
{"text":"First time here. The wait was about 30 minutes which was fine. What was a little irritaing was there was another couple near us who came 15 min after us and they must be frequent diners since a server walked by and recognized them and asked why should they be waiting...he then told them that he'd go back in and bump them to the front since they shouldnt have to wait. In the mean time they were served drinks while the rest of us also waiting didnt get as much as a hello.  I get it, treat your regulars well but does it mean to neglect your potential regulars? Food was good. Shrimp was big. Clams were flavorful. The snow crab was a little bland. Trifecta was delish.  Service was friendly....but a couple hours after getting home, the hubs and I have made several trips to the bathroom and now our son just threw up."}
{"text":"This place fills my cravings for when I am craving Boiling Crab or Kickin' Crab in California.  The food tastes great but it can get a bit pricey.  

I usually order 1 lb. clams, trifecta, mild (#1 level spice) $12/lb. and 1 lb. of shrimp, trifecta, mild (#1 level spice) $10/lb.  

The clams are pretty good, but the shell itself is really thick and heavy so you really don't get a lot of clams for 1 lb.  

The shrimps are quite large and so tasty with the trifecta sauce.  The do come out super hot, so I always burn my little fingers when I try to peel the shrimp.

Come knowing you're hands will get dirty!  This location also has BBQ.  I tried it before and it's not too bad, but the seafood is why you should come here!"}
{"text":"I am not a Creole fan at all but this place is great. I did not order or eat in the boil that our larger group participated in. My friends said all the food was good. They had oysters, crab, and clams. I had a shrimp basket with Cajun fries and Cole Slaw. We also shared apps. I liked the Cajun Edamame, Who knew? The fried Calamari is very, very good here. I love their spices and seasonings. Be warned. I  tried level 4 at the Spice festival and I literally could not feel my face for an hour. Be careful. Level 2 seems best. I love their shrimp dipping sauce too. Just a note, I think they have the best Cole Slaw I have ever tasted. I know random, huh? I loved their Cajun fries."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! First time here with my husband and two young girls. Jake-our server was excellent and helpful on recommending food choices. Wonderful flavors and atmosphere was chill. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this place a 3 it's because I was very hungry and I had to wait an hour to eat.  Also the waiter gave us kind a mild attitude when we were asking question but whatever the food make it up for all the waiting and the waiter  attitude lol.  I had so much fun trying to crack the king and snow crab legs. The flavor was amazing too.  King crabs is my favorite with the mild trifecta seasoning.  My sister like the snow crab better because it's easier to crack them. 

Overall, cool place I'll be back again on paid day because it's a little pricey.  Totally worthy."}
{"text":"Lobster, blue crabs, and king crab were amazing! I believe out server was Liz, great job! Very friendly and attentive! Will definitely be back! Hopefully next time they'll have crawfish! Yum!"}
{"text":"When I was asked \"Does that sound good?\" after being told about ACB, of course I said \"Heck, yes! You know I love seafood!\" But then we arrived and my happiness meter went through the roof!  Everyone was wearing a bib, some had gloves,  the walls were covered in scribbles, doodles and john hancocks from all over and the energy was super casual. Then the bags came... first some king crab, then some shrimp,  blue crab and mmm mmm mmm! I ordered the blue crab in a \"class 3 medium\" spicy (because mild = wimpy) and sure enough it was not wimpy! I was glad our shrimp was in the \"trifecta\" seasoning because it was amazing. I basically want to visit this place at least once a month because I already crave it! Thank you Lauren for being awesome and I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"After several awesome visits to the A.C Shack (sans \"& BBQ\") I was excited to try this place. Sure enough same great service and food with optional BBQ (brisket sandwich looked yummy but could use some toast on the bread).  The clam strips were a bit too spicy but the waiter got us a fresh, plain order and they were much better. I enjoyed another bag o shrimp, trifecta (lemon pepper + garlic + cajun seasonings all in one) and some big juicy blue crabs with an angry orchard to wash it all down. I especially love the app \"the list\" because although we were told it'd be a 40 min wait for a table we were able to leave, and get back just in time for our booth. Jolly good show!"}
{"text":"Very good food, portions are very generous. Friendly wait staff, unless they are shorthanded, then all you get is a quick welcome and a what will you have.  
I enjoyed the dining experience, but I wish their prices were a little lower."}
{"text":"Such a fun experience! We shared a few seafood boils, oysters,  gator nuggets , hush puppies and calamari. Loved it all except the calamari. Server was a gem. Great drinks. A fun family dinner. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Holy yum!! We went on NYE and it was amazing! I ordered the snow crab and the clams. I will never go to Joe's Crab Shack ever again. This is my #1 Crab place!"}
{"text":"Tried to come here once and there was an hour and a half wait.

So we came back a couple weeks later at 10:00pm and was nice not to wait.

Sat at a booth with butcher paper on it. Was suprised by all the televisions all throughout the restaurant and the garage door.

We ordered the Deep Fried Catfish Basket with Cajun Fries, Salmon Basket over Rice and a pound of shrimp with corn on the cob and Sausage Links.

The Catfish was very good along with the Cajun Fries. The sauce that came with the Catfish was very good but the Catfish was good with or without it.

The Salmon was grilled very nice and placed on top a bed of plain white rice. The thing that stood out was how the salmon stayed nice and warm throughout the entire time we ate it. 

Both fish meals were tasty and prepared well. No frills served in a basket but so good and inexpensive.

As for the shrimp they were large size shrimp or prawns mixed in a plastic bag with the sausage and corn on the cob in the trifecta sauce.

Enjoyed the meal very much. The sauce had good flavor without being to spicy.

And you can not beat the prices - Salmon $12, Catfish  $9 and Shrimp  $12/lb.

Can't wait to come back and try the BBQ along with other seafood dishes"}
{"text":"I don't remember the last time I pig out on seafood as much as I did last night. I ate so much that I am still full the next morning.

This is actually the 2nd time I was here (before I became an active yelper). I didn't care for this place the first time I was here, but this time - wow it blew my mind out the water. With a table of 5, We started with raw and cooked oysters. The rare one was so delicious that it melts in my mouth. The cooked ones were OK. I honestly prefer the raw one instead. For main entree, I ordered a lb of queen crab legs (Trifecta flavor). Meats were a bit tiny and the flavor was just OK. However, the corn soak in the sauce was absolutely delicious. I took a bite of my friend's king crab & it was sweet and packed with meats. I also took a bite of the clams (Pacific Rim flavor) and ended up ordering another 2 lbs bag right after. In the end, we ordered sweet potatoes and dip them in different bags of sauce that we had. 

I don't know if there is anything I don't like here. Ill definitely come back here again. Service was friendly and great."}
{"text":"I visited the Angry Crab for the first time on a Tuesday night with my family.   The hostess was very pleasant and the service prompt.  The server (a very nice young man) began his introductory comments with a list of menu items they'd run out of, and it went downhill from there.  I ordered the Grilled Salmon over Rice, and found the salmon to be seriously over-cooked.  The coleslaw was inedible.  Scanning the other Yelp reviews, it appears that our experience might have been an anomaly.  Having said that, it's unlikely that I'll return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"We are excited that we have this great restaurant in Ahwatukee! The catfish was tasty and the portion size was generous. Great variety of spice levels - watch out! ;-) Fun atmosphere to watch the game! We will be back often."}
{"text":"I loved coming here and not just because of the food,  the service was awesome.  The service and the ambiance deserve an extra stand-alone star.  They captured the fwel of a down south restaurant in presence as well as ambiance.  Most places can't get the correct feel/presence.  ANGRY CRAB does! The staff was beyond friendly and accommodating.   The guys working there walked the live crawfish and live lobsters around the dining room for folks to see!  I really found the crawdaddies to be quite Interesting looking creatures!   

So I came for a UYE arranged by Arana W here today.   I got there early and held a table for our group.   I was starving so I ordered a pound of crawfish with the Trifecta sauce at #3 spice level.  Half a dz Grilled Oysters and a basket of the calamari.  I nibbled a couple of the calamari and packaged that to go.  I dug into the crawfish and obliterated them!  I also ate all 6 oysters.  I enjoyed everything.  I wished that the grilled oysters were less done and more spiced.   I thought that the trifecta at spicy level 3 was good, but level 3 was barely spicy at all to me.  I was wondering what 4 was like.  There is a seriuos warning on spice level4, so I was afraid to get it, but if you truly like spicy food, I would request 3.5 if I return.  

It is difficult to come here and not compare this place to BC or HnJC or other popular \"boil\" restaurants (I never mention a competitor by name in my reviews).  I like the other new crawfish joint in Tempe just a little better because of their combo sauce.  This is hard becauae the feel, service and ambiance in Angry Crab is like being at home down south.  I danced in the dining room after lunch and knew it would be ok... yes, this was downhome for sure! 

My return factor is 100%.  I am bringing my mom when she comes and I will update!"}
{"text":"I bumped this review up to 5 stars because AC is your best bet for the Southern flavored seafood boils.   Plus,  their menu has tasty options beyond the boils that don't seem like after-thoughts ie - \"Oh yeah,  let's put something else on the menu besides seafood boils\".   Nice because boils can be a little messy. 

It is no secret,  I love the little dirt Devils known to most as crawfish,  some know them as crayfish and others crawdads.   For the past 2 years,  I have had the pleasure of going between AC and HnJC for my crawfish.   Crawfish are in season from early in the year until about MID-SUMMER.  They are best,  to me, between April and late June.  The window is small considering the fact that I can eat snow crab all year long.   OK,  with that in mind,  it is mid-June and I have been to both places 3 times each since April. 

I have come to the conclusion that Angry Crab is the best and most consistently good establishment in Phoenix for Southern flavored seafood boils.   Every time I have gone over the past 2 years,  I have received a consistently flavorful and fresh batch of crawfish.   I order the Trifecta-hot.   There is always an adequate amount of seasoning and the seasoning has consistently tasted good and the same.  I normally add half an order of sausage and corn to go in my boil.  I Took a visiting family member their this week and she said her crab boil was the best flavored she has had in quite some time. 

The nice part about AC is the \"extra\"  stuff on the menu is equally as good.   Po' boy sandwiches,  char-grilled oysters (oooh lala,  delicous)  and the oyster shooter is to die for!   They also have the yummiest seasoned fries.   If you like oysters or if you like escargot, I highly recommend that you order the char-grilled oysters.  They are delicious!  You won't regret it.  Send me a compliment if you read my review and order them!  I'll just reply back, \"I told you so!\"  

BTW: They do have BBQ.  If you read through my reviews, I only do BBQ at one establishment in PHoenix.  Their oysters are good on the barbie.  I have no clue about the other meats.

Kid Factor 7/10
My Return Factor: 100%."}
{"text":"Such a fun place! Came in with a party of 28 people last Sunday morning. Brandon was very attentive and had such a fun sense of humor. I'm allergic to shrimp so I ended up ordering the Buffalo Chicken Po' Boy with coleslaw and a side of their smoked mac and cheese. Everything was delicious!! The rest of the family got down with the seafood bags. We all left very full and satisfied."}
{"text":"After months of waiting, Angry Crab has finally opened in Goodyear! Our party of 7 dined there and we were all very happy with our meals. Some ordered the shrimp, some ordered the snow crab, then we picked our seasonings and heat levels. We also tried the hush puppies (a bit too spicy for our tastes) and cajun fries, (good!). We were most impressed with the Manager Deion, who came by our table with a live crab and lobster to show us and to answer any questions. He told us where the seafood came from and that it comes in fresh daily! We finished up our meals with cheesecake that they get from the Cheesecake Factory which was delicious. Highly recommend this restaurant,  though it is a bit messy. They serve the seafood in the bags that they are boiled in and you eat with your fingers. We will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Waitress seems confused about the food on the menu - came in. Saturday night at 7:30 and they were completely out of BBQ.  We come here to satisfy our large families food requests - not everyone eats sea food.  After going through everyone's orders and 10 min at the table she announces they have no meat.  We have one person that can only eat the meat here - we asked why she didn't start with that - she responded that how would the hostess know they were out of meat - clueless
I would have left - but the rest of the family had ordered
Won't come back!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this wonderful place ... so I'll only say a few . Love the late night employees and especially the great group of people. I have always enjoyed great service God bless the angry crew . Also thank you for the military discount. All of you are 5 stars in my book"}
{"text":"Flew in for the weekend and wanted some seafood for lunch, got off the plane and looked this place up. I frequent The Boiling Crab in Sacramento where I live and this place had the same idea. Say at the bar, and the bartender Freja took great care of me. Extremely attentive and knowledgeable. I ordered the shrimp and sausage at level 3, and she told me about their level 6, so I ordered it on the side. The 3 was great but if you like a little more heat get the 6, I mixed the whole thing in my bag and it was awesome. Definitely recommend this place. Also a great place to watch games, tons of TVs. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Fun atmosphere and great service!! We got the king crab legs with sausage, hush puppies, and Cajun fries. Everything was awesome!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This dinner was so incredibly messy it was annoying. The crab legs were good, but I will not come back here again. I felt like this is a place where you go if you dont mind your hands and face dripping in butter while you eat. I also really despise places that give you plastic forks and paper cups when you are eating at a sit down restaurant."}
