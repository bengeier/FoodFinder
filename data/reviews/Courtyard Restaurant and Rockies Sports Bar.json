{"text":"We stayed at the hotel and since it was late we decided it would be easiest to eat at the in house restaurant.  When we sat ourselves the servers ignored us for about 15 minutes, one of the servers actually just glared at us while he was serving a difference table(the only other table in the restaurant mind you) so we weren't holding out much hope. We were just getting ready to leave and try somewhere else when a different server who had been mixing drinks at the bar approached us. She was apologetic and pleasant. She promptly took our orders and brought us drinks.  Everyone at the table got burgers, I got the stampede BBQ burger, my husband got the flames burger, my sister got the veggie burger and her boyfriend got the chinook burger. Cute names for burgers.   The guys got onion rings with their burgers which were delicious, but fairly sparse for how much more they charged extra.   Everyone enjoyed their burgers, my sister said the whole corn kernels in her veggie burger were a little strange but she got through it, and said it was pretty good for a veggie burger. The patties of the real burgers were great, a non-premade patty makes all the difference.  The prices were pretty average, I'd probably go here again if I were staying at the hotel, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get there for dinner."}
{"text":"One server working, but a light night. I had a bison burger and fries with milk. Super.  Staff was friendly. The restaurant was clean. Best of all the food was good."}
{"text":"Not a bad little place at all. I stayed in the hotel, so this was an easy choice.  Surprised by the reasonably priced pints,  great staff. Decent digs, and comfy seats. I love the big atrium over head and lots of tv's to gander at.  I had the flames burger, no doubt a nod to the venerable Calgary team of the same name. It's suppose to have a little heat ( no not the Calgary farm team in abbotsford bc) owing to the chipotle mayo, but sadly like the flames it looks good but doesn't deliver any heat.  Having said all that I would still get it as it is a tasty burger. The fries also were really good.  Great place for meeting friends and eating pubish food.  I think it would be a good choice if you are looking for someplace none too busy and your not wanting to spend too much on your booze bill. Some people might not like the open pool right beside it as there's a chance it could be full of screaming kids. But my visit was almost grave quiet and I liked it. I'll be back."}
