{"text":"Estación Inka lo máximo ! Esta es mi segunda visita y la verdad satisfecho con todo. El Sandwich de lomo y el pollo a la brasa pasaron la prueba. Gracias por abrir este rinconcito peruano, que me transporta a mi país."}
{"text":"Top shelf chicken at this local peruvian restaurant. My favorite menu item is the Chicken Brassa sandwich. I would recommend asking for extra green sauce because the green sauce is BOSS! Overall, great casual lunch or dinner spot on University."}
{"text":"Since I heard this little restaurant was going to open I become intrigued by how this new concept of \"fast Peruvian food\" would turn out. 
Once you open the door, first thing you see it's a counter (that's where you order) with a big chalkboard behind introducing their menu consisting of sandwiches, hamburgers, roasted chicken, sides and desserts. The place is small maybe with a dozen of tables and some Peruvian art on the wall, everything is simple but with a modern feel to it. It's a very bright place.

Ladies and gentleman, the food, I ordered the 1/4 roasted chicken (juicy and the golden skin on the outside had a particular yummy flavor worthy of goddesses) with yucca fries (nicely crispy) a small salad (lettuce and tomatoes) and a yellow sauce that kept me short of breath the wholeee meal (it was that good), creamy, a little bit spicy with a touch of red bell pepper I think, sorry but I HAD TO ask for more and I will never regret it. The roasted chicken doesn't come with those sides necessarily, they have other combinations you can choose from.

 My boyfriend had a chicharon sandwich which had small chunks of broiled pork ( it reminded me of \"fried carnitas\") lettuce, cilantro creole sauce (pickled red onions) sweet potatoes and a side of Aji verde, it doesn't come with any side, if you want regular fries, sweet plantains, yucca fries or something else it is separate ( they are between $2.50-$3.50). The bread had a nice texture with sesame seeds on top.

I also saw a small cooler on the right side of the counter with some desserts like flan, three milk cakes, rice pudding, etc. They looked nice but it would be for next time :) 

I noticed they are open late on Fridays and Saturdays until 3am, wow, I heard that has been very convenient for students coming out from nearby bars around that time."}
{"text":"Had the chicharron sandwich. Awesome flavor, good texture. Love that there are sweet potatoes on the sandwich! I will return to try the other options, which all look delicious."}
{"text":"I eat here once a week! Love the fried yucca and rice and beans! The fruit smoothies are a must! They have updated their menu and cater for the meat lovers with authentic Peruvian food!! Close to parking and walking distance for downtown folks!"}
{"text":"Delicious food at affordable prices in a bright, clean atmosphere. I had the Chicharron Esmeralda, and my husband had the Lomo Saltado. Both were outstanding. Full of fresh flavors and not too greasy or heavy. Yucca fries were also very light and tasty with a flavorful dipping sauce. The cashier was very helpful  and friendly and patiently explained much of the menu to us. Definitely will be returning here frequently!"}
{"text":"Wow. I've been wanting to come here for a while- I've been to Inka Heritage for dinner and liked it but it's a bit pricey for everyday eating so when I heard they were opening up a casual eatery I was very intrigued.

Based on other people's reviews I got the Chicarron de Esmeralda (plus I was intrigued by the not one, but TWO secret ingredients the menu said it had). It was very substantially sized and the cilantro sauce it comes with on the side is incredible- do not skimp on putting this on your sandwich. 

Although the Chicarron was good, it paled in comparison to the A lo Pobre burger. Words can not describe how delicious this was. 
The meat was deliciously juicy and pink, the eggs were perfectly cooked so that when you cut/bit into it the yolk spread over the sandwich, the sweet plantains were delicious on their own but also added an incredible contrast to the other flavors of the sandwich, the shoestring potatoes added a real nice textural contrast, and the sauce on the bun reminded me of In N Out's sauce so no explanation necessary there. In our gluttony we asked for avocado to be added onto this burger (we were debating between the A lo Pobre and the Estacion), and while adding avocado is never a bad idea, in this case it wasn't necessary. The flavors of this burger were so distinct yet melded together in a way I didn't think was possible. 

We ordered our sandwiches to go and they came out quickly, but not too quickly as to where you're slightly concerned about it.
I really liked the decor and decorations in the place and will definitely eat there in addition to getting food to go.

All in all the space is really nice, the people working there are friendly, the Chicarron sandwich was good, but the A lo Pobre burger was out of this world. I will definitely be going back to get the A lo Pobre again and to try everything else on their menu."}
{"text":"I grew up in the DC metro area, which seems to be the epicenter of pollo a la brasa in the US. In recent years, Madison has had a few restaurants that attempted it, but Estacion Inka comes closest to that level of quality. They also sell a delicious selection of sandwiches, fresh juices, deserts, and sides. The space is very casual, clean, and well decorated, and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Savory!  That word appears in their description of many of their offerings and they aren't kidding.  I had the chicharon.  Great bread, good meat, sparky sauce.  And lots.  Big sandwich.  It's a bright cheery spot.  Papaya juice came freshly prepared from the kitchen.  Can't wait to go back.  Desserts look good, if you have room!"}
{"text":"Wife and I went here for lunch.  Had the Chicharon De Esmeralda and Serrano sandwiches and an order of empanadas.  Holy smokes were they both good.  Unique flavors to Madison.  I really, really want this place to stick around as I could see us eating here regularly."}
{"text":"Estación Inca is a great authentic Peruvian / Latin American cuisine! Let's start of with a great and clean ambience/restaurant! The restaurant was very clean and well put together. Also the service was great. The food was excellent it was very authentic... The Lomo (stake) sandwich was very good! Also the juego de Maracuja (Passion fruit Juice) was super good! Overall I really enjoy the food the service and the restaurant ambience! For me and my family it is great that we have a local South American restaurant near town because it touches close to home since we are from South America (Colombia)!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches with high quality meats, fresh tropical juices, and a clean warm atmosphere. Authentic Peruvian at reasonable prices. Very friendly and prompt service. Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is great. I got a steak tenderloin sandwich, my wife got a pulled chicken sandwich. Both were excellent, and at a great place. Lately it seems like every new restaurant comes at a higher price, so it's great to get such good food at low prices. You can even get a quarter chicken and rice for five dollars, which has to be one of the cheapest meals in Madison. And as someone who's been to Peru, it's charming to see chicha morada and inks kola on the menu. Estacion Inka is sure to become a weeknight standby."}
{"text":"I hate to give out bad reviews, but the dinning experience is literally the worst to be honest. The idea of the restaurant might be good, but the execution is terrible. The food tastes really bad (pretty much just soy source trough and through), and you get a baby-portion amount of food. I'm addition, nobody cleans the tables, they are all pretty nasty and you will have to clean them by yourself."}
{"text":"Awesome, never really eaten Peruvian food before, but I enjoyed my meal. I recommend the lomo saltado"}
{"text":"Amazing and fast when needed! Food is always fresh and hot. The best is the Rotisserie Chicken with a side of cilantro rice. Such a great place. Their tres leches is amazing too,"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious! Went with some work friends during lunch. Had the Estacion Burger which has lettuce, tomatoes, eggs, avocado, shoestring potatoes, and salsitas. It was perfect! Tried the jugo de Lúcuma & the jugo de Maracuyá. Both so delicious and refreshing. Also had their Inca Kola which had a sweet/fruity flavor. A little pricey but worth it. Overall, it's was very satisfying. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Inconsistently good. We've been 4 or 5 times now and I've gotten the Lomo Saltado every time. The first time it was amazing... I wanted another one right away. Several times since, though, the meat has been so tough I could barely chew through it. 

Yucca fries are amazing. And the sauces, though I have no idea what they are, are very tasty."}
{"text":"Always delicious, chicken is fresh and not dry, cilantro rice is amazing. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm loving all the diverse South American food showing up around Madison. I've had Estacion Inka a few times and I've only gotten the Lomo Saldato, but it never disappoints. It used to come as a sandwich but now a platter with rice and fries. And the green sauce they have, I could put on just about anything. The only thing is that there isn't a ton of meat in the platter, more quantities of the sides instead of the main. And I think the main entree should shine."}
{"text":"Terrible everything. Gross sandwich, gross \"plantains\", gross fries. Will never order here again. It was fast, but what flavor it did have was crap. Get anything else in madison"}
{"text":"Yes yes yes yes to this place! I've been looking for some good food here in Madison for the low. It is much cheaper compared to the surrounding food joints. I always come here for their 1/4 chicken with salad and french fries. Their chicken.. is... SOOO GOOD and tender and flavorful. WOW! And, to top it all off, the staff is so sweet. There are not many places here where I can freely speak my native tongue, so it's nice to get my Spanish on :) Love this place! I just keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Delicious lomo saltado sandwiches! Their juice was yummy and fresh too! Good experience."}
{"text":"Just went to lunch here and I was happily surprised with both the quality and quantity of food that I got for the price. I had a 1/2 a roasted chicken with rice and beans, which was a ton of delicious food for about $8 - with a Coke an the tip, my bill was about $10.50.

The chicken had some type of a spice rub on it, which was great, and came with two different types of sauce on the side. The rice and beans each came separately in their own decent sized bowl. 

The sandwiches looked great. This place joins Mediterranean Cafe as one of my two favorite campus area lunch spots."}
{"text":"We originally tried to visit Estacion Inka earlier this summer. We stopped in on a hot August night. When we arrived, we discovered that they either have no air-conditioning or it was not working. Either way, we were dripping sweat while waiting for the rest of our party. We decided there was no way we would enjoy that so we left.

In October on a cooler evening, we decided to give it another try. I'm so glad we did! I still don't know if they actually have air conditioning but we didn't need it. We asked if we could rearrange the tables to accommodate our group of six and they were happy to oblige and help us rearrange. At the counter where you order the cashier explained the dishes and what options were still available (as they were out of some dishes.) They then delivered each dish as it was ready. 

The food was fantastic! I had the quarter chicken with cilantro rice. The chicken was juicy and moist on the inside w/a crispy skin on the outside. The rice was dense and delicious. I can't believe the flavors. I don't know what spices they used, but it was incredible. For dessert I ordered the tres leches cake. Sweet, moist, again absolutely delicious! 

I'm so glad we gave this place a second chance. The prices were reasonable and the food was fantastic. We will absolutely go back."}
{"text":"Simply delicious! Sandwiches were filling and flavorful without being heavy. And oh my goodness get the mango smoothie, so creamy and amazing (and I'm not usually a smoothie fan)."}
{"text":"Whenever we are in the mood for chicken, this is always one of the first spots we think of. We always have a great meal here and the folks that run the place are always so welcoming.

They have a wonderfully flavorful rotisserie chicken. Perfectly cooked and deliciously marinated. I'd love to review the other items but the chicken is so good that I can't ever convince myself to order something else when I am here. The chicken plate comes with some rice, beans, and some delicious sauces. 

They also have a really tasty tres leches cake if you have some room for dessert."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a long time. I must say it met all of my expectations.

The place is small and has a lot of charm. The people who work here are very friendly. They will gladly explain what's on the menu for you. This is nice because most of the food has a lot ingredients mostly common in Peru, like yuca and sweet plantain, which are delicious by the way. 

I ordered an A lo Pobre burger, the best translation for it I think is poor man's burger. It is not poor at all, let me tell you. It is decent size and very delicious! The special sauce that comes as a side with the burger was finger-licking good. 

For dessert I had an alfajor, which kinda looks like a macaroon but less puffy and flat and is filled with dulce de leche. It was really good. 

They carry Inca Kola. This is Peru's most popular soda. It really adds to the authenticity of the place. If you like Mountain Dew, you're going to like Inca Kola. 

I want to try the rest of the menu so I'll definitely be coming back to Estación Inka."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant on campus! The cilantro rice with half chicken is my staple. The cookies are also the best I've had. I'll always recommend this place. Meals here don't make me hate myself lol"}
{"text":"It's decent food - but I had a few gripes that forced me to bring this down to 4 - stars. First the good - the sauces provided (green, cheese yellow and the Saltado sauces were really tasty - perfectly balanced) 

The bad unfortunately pertains to the other key parts of the meal - the steak was over cooked and too hard/chewy. Additionally the french fries were too soggy - it's a shame this came so close to being really good, but - it's just slightly above average.

I think if you were to ask the chef to not over cook the steak, and have the fries done at a hotter temp - it would have been awesome."}
{"text":"In town from MKE for a concert at the nearby Kohl Center, the wife and I came here because of the good reviews and no wait compared to other restaurants in the area. Plus Peruvian food is outside of our norm, so why not take a chance?

I ordered the brasa (chicken) sandwich with a side of French fries. The chicken sandwich was tasty however they only get two stars from me because both things I ordered were messed up. The fries were terrifyingly undercooked and the sandwich was missing one of the toppings- shoestring potatoes. I didn't complain because we wanted to get to the concert and because the sandwich still tasted good. 

The wife orders the 1/4 chicken with a side of fried plantains. She enjoyed them both. When I asked if she would come back, she only replied \"maybe.\""}
{"text":"Peruvian food... could be weird. But it's not.  Estación is unique, clean, and friendly. I got the arroz con pollo my first time and the cilantro rice was insanely fresh tasting and the  chicken crispy and juicy. I was really impressed.  You get a side of fresh chopped onions tomatoes and cilantro. The gentlemen at counter was polite and fast. I will come here whenever I want a good lunch.  Light, tasty, and something different!"}
{"text":"Lomo Saltado was excellent, since starting Estacion Inka has been my go to place for a nice meal. Family-owned Estacion Inka brings the taste of Peru to Madison and maintains the authentic taste that may not appeal to all tastes. While I was disappointed that the Lomo Saltado burger was taken off the menu, overall it has not let me down! Also, highly recommend the Tres Leches!"}
{"text":"I've only been once, so am going to give a first opinion and reserve to come back for further judgement.

The place looks great: clean, modern, and filled with natural light. It makes you want to go in.

The menu is sandwich and roasted chicken. All sandwiches sound great. I got the lomo saltado and husband got the chicaron. Plus we got yuca and plantain as sides. I thought the food was good. More refined food than the other options on this part of town and definitely better presented. Ingredients looked fresh (with the exception of bread that was a bit staler than it should have ideally been) and were tasty. And the sum of the ingredients was a well balanced flavor profile and texture combo. Also, the sandwich were big enough to get you full without being so much food that you will fall asleep after lunch and feel gross for the rest of the afternoon. The sides were on the smaller side, but more than enough with the sandwich. So success on the whole front.

I also saw some great looking desserts that are waiting to tempt you in a case full of wondrous delights. I'm not much for sweets, but I was tempted. And I was also tempted by the homemade fruit juices, but a girl has to choose so I skipped those too this time.

Next time I think I'll have the chicken. Seeing they are owned by the same guys at Inka Heritage and thinking about how good the chicken is there, I am curious to try! And I might grab a juice to go with it."}
{"text":"I love Estacion Inka! You get a lot for your money and the food is delicious. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"After several failed attempts to make it here (over the span of very many months and for various reasons) I finally made it in today! Minus one star for the two times I have been by and you were closed over weekday lunch for no apparent reason.

I have been drooling over the pictures and descriptions on Yelp of the Chicharron de Esmeralda sandwich. My heart sank as I frantically scanned and rescanned the menu today. It wasn't there. Thankfully I spotted the Chicarron sandwich and it seemed, as described, close enough. Counter service was friendly and my sandwich was up very quickly. I suppose I could have asked if they could still make the Esmeralda but it didn't occur to me until just now. The Chicarron sandwich very much lived up to my expectations for the most part. 

Those in the know know I strongly dislike mayo and that it's a huge pet peeve of mine when the menu does not disclose mayo comes on the sandwich. Be forewarned fellow mayo haters, there is mayo on this sandwich even though it's not listed on the menu!! My first bite went like this \"yummm...wait what is that icky taste? Oh, dear, that's mayo.\" Sure enough peak under the large piece of lettuce covering the bottom bun and it was mayo in all its horrible glory. Luckily enough it was under the lettuce so the rest of the sandwich was mayo free and I ate it upside down on the top part of the bun. Mayo complaining aside, the pork was perfection. The salsa criolla (lime marinated onions) were to die for and the yummy green sauce that came on the side is the stuff food dreams are made of."}
{"text":"Good flavor but where was the meat on the lomo saltado? 4 little pieces per plate is not enough!!"}
{"text":"The chicharon (sp?) sandwich is probably one of the best sandwiches in town. The atmosphere is clean and friendly. My only qualm was that service can be really slow at lunchtime for a place that puts \"fast food\" in its self description. Today they were having trouble getting orders straight and serving people seated together simultaneously. The bread was also slightly stale. But it's a testament to their sandwiches' tastiness than even some stale bread doesn't detract from the taste."}
{"text":"Really great food. Very yummy. I definitely recommend. I had the Sanguche de pollo and it was so great. Sauces were very good too"}
{"text":"The set-up in here is very cute and modern and I love the photos they put up from Peru! 
I ordered the 1/4 Chicken with Sweet Plantains and it was pretty satisfying! I had never been a fan of sweet plantains before but this meal definitely changed my mind. The green limey slightly spicy sauce that came with it was DELICIOUS. The chicken was done well and spiced nicely. I will be back."}
{"text":"I had a group of my closer friends join me for a birthday lunch at Estación Inka a week ago. 
I was slightly concerned for my friend who's vegetarian, because their vegetarian option is to use mushroom in place of the animal protein.
She ordered a Lomo Saltado with mushroom instead of meat, and LOVED it. 
She said she can't stop telling people about this place.
All other ladies in the group couldn't get over how delicious the food was! Every single person seemed thoroughly pleased. 
I ordered an El Chicarron de Esmeralda, and it was juicy pork sandwich (even if a bit fatty, but thus is street food) with a fresh lime juice flavor, red onions and other \"secret ingredients\",  yucca fries and guanabana juice (I was so excited about their juice options!!)
This place actually happily reminded me of my childhood Brazil. The juices by default? Come blended with milk. SO, SO GOOD. 

People, if you're looking for a new place to eat and to expand your world perspective without breaking the bank, go to Estación Inka! Icreíble!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Not sure what they put in their food but I find myself eating here 3-4 times a week. The 1/4 chicken is a quick and delicious lunch. Also a plus is they are open late night which satisfies the late night crowd."}
{"text":"This restaurant is probably the best thing that's happened to madison. It's quick Peruvian food and sandwiches on uni ave. their spices on the rotisserie chicken are mind blowing as well as the green lime sauce on the butticara sandwich, which is also perfectly seasoned pork and juicy too. I definitely recommend this place to eat anytime , the prices are reasonable, and the owners are so nice! The service is great and very friendly, the place is clean and sleek on the inside, and the chicha morada drink is amazing! Every one try it"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. I ordered delivery and it came surprisingly fast. The lime cilantro dip was delicious. I ordered the tropical chicken platter and mango smoothie. I've ordered from quite a few restaurants that delivered whenever I was in town on business, and this is one of the best places so far."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!! It's relatively new to campus but one of the best! The space is small so large groups should order to go or use grub hub for delivery. The staff is very friendly and the service is quick. The best part is the food! I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu and the sandwiches are huge! I ordered a chicken brasa sandwich and it was so packed I had chicken falling out with every bite, a very good problem to have. The next time you're heading out for food give this place a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Estacion Inka (or Inka Station, as it is right in front of a bus stop) was a great experience. Fantastic food here at a reasonable price point. The decor is both tasteful and seemingly authentic-- clean tables and chair, with photos of peru and Inka Cola soda cans full of flowers at each sitting. The food was awesome-- we had the chicken and rice, Yucca (with amazing Aji sauce), and the Estacion burger-- covered in shoestring potatoes, avocado, and an egg. All incredibly satisfying. And to finish it off, the juices were super fresh-- fresh-pressed passion fruit juice, as well as chica morada, a purple corn drink, were both amazingly refreshing. 
We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is delightful! I went there for lunch on several occasions and would go more frequently if my budget allowed for it.

They have great specials, delicious sandwiches and yummy yucca fries. Their chicken sandwich was out of this world and had itty bitty shoestring fries on top that make it awesome. 

Great selection of import sodas!"}
{"text":"Yum! We had the Tropical Chicken Platter and the Arroz con Pollo Platter. Both were delicious, chicken was tasty! I got a slice of the tres leches cake. A little dry, but overall decent. Really great service, friendly and food came quickly. Definitely returning."}
{"text":"Awesome! We had the Chicharron de Esmerelda and Lomo Saltada and both were great, especially the cilantro sauce. Tried the Inca Kola and it was really good - kind of like Rock n Rye. Turns out my friends who travel to Peru were so jealous, it was a favorite there and hard to find in the US."}
{"text":"Really tasty pork sandwich. You can actually taste the pork, doesn't need any sauce. Sweet potato fries in the sandwich? Brilliant. 

Great herb sauce to go with it. 

Wife had ceviche with giant Peruvian corn. 

Hit the spot for a late afternoon meal as we walked around Madison."}
{"text":"AMAZING SANDWICHES! Every sandwich on their small menu is made of delicious, high quality meat. You won't find any cold cuts here as far as I know - instead the sandwiches are made of juicy steak, braised pork, etc.

I loved my lomo saltado sandwich and loved my chicarron de Esmeralda even more! They both came with this awesome tangy sauce that has lime and cilantro. I've also ordered the salchipapa which I imagine would be pretty amazing as a late night snack - hot dogs on french fries with 4 different delicious sauces. The juice was pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Yum! Affordable and delicious. Free wifi. I enjoy the atmosphere with Spanish television and music playing. Try everything on the menu - including the desserts! Nice location and fun, casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised here - the place doesn't look great from the outside, but once you step in you can tell that it's going to be authentic and delicious. 

I ordered their half chicken and split it with a friend - this place definitely gives a lot of food! The fries were mediocre but the chicken itself was fantastic and juicy. 

My whole table thoroughly enjoyed the meal and I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice Peruvian meal. It's cheap, filling, and unique!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad we decided to check out this restaurant. They have a lunch special that consists of rotisserie chicken, white rice and black beans. I opted for the tropical chicken that added the plantains and pickled veggie garnish. I was able to get my choice of white or dark meat with my meal. The chicken was so tender and had a flavorful coating. The rice was cooked to perfection and mixed well with the black beans. They served a green and a yellow sauce on the side. Both were really good with the chicken and the rice/beans mix. The food was quick and perfect for a work lunch."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love Estacion Inka when we dropped by for dinner. All the photos looked good, the menu sounded delicious, Peruvian roast chicken is something I love, and even better, it was fast casual. Maybe we went too late in the day (a little before 7 pm), but we had a pretty mediocre experience unfortunately.

I tried ordering the arroz con pollo, but they had run out of cilantro rice, so they told me no, even when I asked if I could substitute (cheaper) white rice. I ended up getting a quarter chicken with a side of rice & beans, and requested white meat, like I have at every rotisserie or roast chicken place ever with no problem, and was told that they couldn't guarantee that but would just request it on the ticket. First time I've ever gotten that response to a white meat request, and considering they were still taking orders when we left, I doubt they were down to their last chicken of the day.

After the ordering snafus, I hoped that the food would make up for it. Some of it was good. The chicken had good flavor and wasn't dry at all, which was nice. (By the way, I ended up being given dark meat, not white meat, so had to trade with someone else in my group who got a half chicken.) The chicken itself was the best part of the meal. I've had better green sauce, but it was pretty good. I ended up trying some of a friend's creole salsa, which was like a marinated onion salad, and that was tasty. But the rice was hard, the beans were cold and kind of boring, the service was very slow, and ordering was completely frustrating. Maybe it's better earlier in the day, but our experience was disappointing."}
{"text":"Excellent chicken, chicharron sandwich, yucca fries, fried plantains, and smoothies. The rotisserie chicken was juicy and flavorful. The chicharron on the sandwich was a bit crunchy, but soft inside. The marinated onion on top took the dish to the next level. The two sauces are addictive. I couldn't stop dipping. Oh, and the FLAN! So dense and smooth. It was heavenly with the syrup.The menu is simple, but at times, simplicity is best. Everything was prepared fresh with quality ingredients. They know what they're doing here. 

Parking was a bit difficult, so I ended up paying $8 for a ramp. The service is a little slow, but it's certainly worth the wait. 

Voy a regresar! I'll come back!"}
{"text":"We were really excited to eat here but ended up extremely disappointed. 

We waited in line behind one group of four for five minutes and then were told to wait and ended up waiting an addition five minutes before being able to order.

Then, when we are ready to order, they tell us they only have two of the items on the menu in stock.

Seriously disappointed and I'm not sure we're going back."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that Estacion Inka is the first Peruvian sandwich restaurant I ever patronized.  But in my never-ending search for the best sandwiches in Madison, would it be a visit I'd regret or would it open the door to a completely new realm of enchanting sandwichery?    

Estacion Inka is housed in a humble storefront on University Avenue.  If you're traveling by car, there's no parking in front of the restaurant, so you need to search for street parking on Gilman or Frances Streets or the Frances Street ramp.  

The restaurant provides counter service.  There was a bit of a language barrier during the ordering process, but ultimately, through a series of nods and points at the menu board, the cashier and I agreed that I was ordering the El Chicharron de Esmeralda sandwich.  The menu options, listed on a chalkboard above the cashier's station, are limited to burgers, sandwiches and roasted chicken.  Given the interesting sandwich options, it took me a while to decide what to order.  While it wasn't in the card for this visit, Estacion Inka also has a robust set of dessert options (suspiro limeno, tres leches, mouse de lucuma and alfajores to name a few) and 100% natural fruit juices (including options like lucuma, plantain, passion fruit and guanabana).

White is the operative word when describing the interior - white walls, white tables, white chairs.  There are two flat screens in the restaurant - during my visit, one had sports programming and the other was tuned in to the Food Network.  The latter had the volume turned up higher than necessary for the tiny interior.  Compounding the noise problem are the densely packed tables.  Given the initial popularity of the restaurant, you'll be privy to the conversation of others, so pray that your dining neighbors are fetching conversationalists.  Unfortunately for me, the neighboring table during my visit was populated by a group of three bros sharing dating advice, resulting in a temporary reduction of this Yelper's IQ.  

The restaurant offers free Wi-Fi but it took about 20 minutes to figure out the password.  To the credit of the host, she was very persistent in helping to resolve this issue.

As I mentioned earlier, I ordered the $7.99 El Chicharron de Esmeralda sandwich, mainly because the menu description indicated was not one, but two \"secret ingredients\".  When the server dropped off my sandwich, I was admittedly dismayed to see it served on a dry, sesame Kaiser roll and topped with a sh!t ton of raw red onions.  Then I took a deep breath, bit into my sandwich and...SWEET BABY JESUS, I had that WOW! moment, we all pray for when venturing to a new restaurant.  My senses were bombarded by the terrific flavor combination bright lime juice and deep roasted pork.  While the combination of pork and lime is not a new concept, it was the intensity of the flavors that caught me off guard.  A glorious sear on the pork, which included a little fat to boost the flavor, was instrumental in developing the symphony of flavor that greeted me.  Those red onions that I initially worried about added some appreciated bite without contributing any overwhelming bitterness.  A touch of cilantro (sorry Sallie Jo) provided added authenticity to the dish.  While the sandwich provided peppery heat, I really didn't notice it until I had finished devouring my meal.

Even with the noisy atmosphere and wonky Wi-Fi, the bold flavors of the food have me eagerly anticipating a return visit to Inka Estacion."}
{"text":"After eating richly all week, I was really craving some basic roast chicken and shazam there is a Peruvian place downtown.
Instantly memories of lomo saltdo and roast chicken and chicken soup with quinoa came rushing back.
I didn't want to go downtown on graduation weekend but had really wanted to dig into some Peruvian chicken.
Luckily a lot of people already left town and traffic was very light and I was able to easily find a parking spot. 
The place was empty except for one table which was not a good sign since for a graduation weekend all the other places were fully packed. I imagine you don't make your parents splurge on a $10 plate of chicken when you can order $50 of steak.
I ordered at the counter the 1/2 chicken and beans and rice. The chicken was finger licking good with some nice Peruvian spice and the green sauce for some spice. The rice was undercooked and more al dente then it should be.
I liked the chicken and could have easily ordered the whole chicken.
The next time I have a craving for roast chicken, I will definitely come here but my side will be salad or fries."}
{"text":"Very good quality food, lunch special was a good deal for what you get. 

The downside? The cashier's level of service/enthusiasm was just not good at all. We asked for a recommendation for first timers and she just had nothing to suggest to us...it was just awkward.

I will go back but they need to improve this."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place downtown when I need to grab a quick lunch or dinner. Their rotisserie chicken with black beans and rice is only $4.95 and the chicken is spiced wonderfully. All of the sandwiches and burgers I've got have never disappointed as well. The a lo pobre burger has an egg, plantains, and fries on it and it's to die for. The pork sandwiches here are also great because the pork is so rich and tender. Definitely check this place out when you're downtown!"}
{"text":"My heart sings when I think of Estacion Inka. Located right on University Avenue, walking inside is like escaping to a different world where only few things matter: happiness and warm, delicious food. From sandwiches to baked chicken, Estacion Inka hooks it up with amazing flavors, quality meat, and very reasonable prices. Some of my favorites are the Chicarrón sandwich and the Vegetarian sandwich! Comes with a nice toasty bun and delicious light green, creamy dipping sauce. Love stopping here for a nice casual meal and would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I looooove roast chicken! And their's is one of the best in town. Excellent sides and desserts (I'd recommend the tres leches and the alfajores), and flavorful dipping sauces add to the yumminess that Estacion has to offer. I'd suggest calling in if you're coming later in the evening 'cause sometimes they run out of chicken (they're THAT good)!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here twice now and both times it's been great. The sandwiches ate spectacular and reasonable prices and the staff is friendly. The cafe con leche and desserts also great. My new favorite lunch spot downtown!
Oh also it's not listed on the menu but they told me they could make fish sandwiches our mushroom sandwiches if you're not a meat eater"}
{"text":"I was waiting for a bus on the corner of Frances and University.  I realized I didn't have any ready-to-make meals at home.  I decided to chose something from the restaurants on this corner.  Did I want Sushi, Chinese, or sandwiches?  I noticed in the old Taco place had new furniture.  I read the menu on the window and strolled in.

Peruvian Sandwiches, Chicken, fresh juices.  The menu was very intriguing.  The place smelled wonderful.  I chose the chicken with beans and rice.  The counter guy was very friendly.  It didn't take very long for them to put my dinner together and have me catch a bus home.  The restaurant is very well light, the setting was really inviting.  I really enjoyed the pictures on the wall.  A piece of South America in Madison.

When I got home, I finally got to try my dinner.  I don't think I have ever had chicken so moist and flavorful in my life.  The coating had just a touch of heat...but it's the favors that really were spot on.  I really liked the rice and beans combo too.  I am really excited to go there again to try something else and get some fresh fruit juices."}
{"text":"So so so good! This place throws me back to Peru. Very authentic flavors and menu, and delicious food cooked to perfection. I had the chicharon sandwich, french fries, maracuya juice, and chicha morada. I enjoy going to Inka Heritage (also an amazing place), but it's a special occasion place. Estación Inka is an affordable, every day Peruvian option. 

I couldn't be more excited that this has been added to the Madison food landscape. This place gets my enthusiastic thumbs up."}
{"text":"I had the sanguche de pollo sandwhich and I am obsessed! I love Peruvian food, mostly because of the truly elevated flavors. This sandwich is so good; it consists of shredded chicken in a yellow cream sauce that is amazing, and is complemented with tomato, lettuce and crunchy shoestring potatoes. They also give you a slightly spicy, cilantro sauce on the side. I have gone back for this sandwich 3 times in the past 2 weeks, no shame. Also, the juices are very delicious, I love the mango! The only things I didn't love were the decor and I've never been a fan of the iPad paying system (I think they're always weird at fast food places, because they prompt you to tip right away and the person can plainly see what you're choosing- even though you have no idea what to expect of the service. It always guilts you into a decent tip. And when it comes to fast food you really aren't getting the sit down restaurant-style service.)"}
{"text":"This modest chicken shop is a great lunch option on a stretch of University that used to be a bit of a lunch dead zone if you didn't feel like Ian's Pizza.  This place is not complicated:  the roast chicken is moist, perfectly seasoned, and delicious, you eat it, you're happy, done.  (The one sandwich I've had there was good, but when a place has one perfect dish, I stick with it.)"}
