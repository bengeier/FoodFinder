{"text":"We were told to seat ourselves and then waited at the table for a solid 5 minutes, no menu, no drink order. When we finally got waited on, we ordered a beer, they were out of the beer that we wanted. We ordered our meal, they were out of the shrimp for the salad we wanted. The waitress was very nice, it wasn't her fault. This place has got to get it together. Very disappointing meal."}
{"text":"I could've rated this with 5 stars when they first opened, but one star is far too much now. We frequented Supply after they reopened under their new name. We tried everything on the menu and daily specials as they were offered. The location was convenient, the food was consistently tasty, the service was excellent, and the price was perfect! Zero complaints! Our frequent visits have now dwindled to \"we'll go to Supply because everything else is too busy\" or \"I don't know; let's just go to Supply.\" We have watched the wait staff completely turnover several times. We have watched children seat and serve patrons. During one visit, I waited 45 minutes for steamed vegetables that I don't believe ever hit any heat. I always want to give this place \"another chance\" but no more. My last visit there was ubiquitous \"last straw\". We were greeted by the owner who sat us while stating everyone called out of work that day and that the dishwasher was on the line cooking. He continued on by stating, \"that's what I get for having drug addicts work for me!\" He took our drink order and my company and I contemplated leaving after that one drink. After the glasses sat empty for a while, we did order another glass of wine and ordered jalapeno chicken dip as it was one of only a couple offerings that the owner or dishwasher could provide. Our glasses emptied again and no appetizer ever made it to the table. We attempted to scrounge enough money in our wallets to pay for our drinks and leave, but to no avail. I observed similar experiences around the restaurant as patrons seemingly grew impatient with the wait and lack of service. It is unfortunate that this is what this place has become because I so desperately wanted to love it, but the days of \"let's give it one more chance\" are over. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good find! The atmosphere was casual and the place was empty (we arrived on a Fri night at 5:30, so early). Great recommendation on my side and beer selection. My kids enjoyed their meals as well! Friendly and knowledgable staff. Place started filling up towards the end of our meal. Brussel Sprouts were yummy, wings were on spot (my son had the lemon pepper), the chicken bites and fries pleased my daughter. Good ranch too! Will be back soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this evening. We had the firecracker Shrimp as a starter. They were fried on a bed of lettuce with a chipotle/ranch style drizzle over them. They were great. I had the hamburger steak, which was on special. It was accompanied by peppers, onions, and a very tasty mushroom gravy. It was perfectly cooked. I tried the Mac and cheese with it and was very pleased. It had a beautiful atmosphere, too. Recommended."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and love the tap handles.  The beer selection was decent and great service.   Fries pickles were ok.  Hamburger was nothing special.  Small portion for the side of sweet potato fries.   Good place to go for beer and an appetizer, but not to eat your dinner."}
{"text":"The place is fairly new.  But the food.   Oh the food.   We had the grilled steamers done with bacon, lemon poppy dead butter, sherry reduction.   Amazing.   Also the baked Brie  which was very good.  They offer specials and tonite we had the stuffed pork chop with spinach Gorgonzola and dried cherry reduction.  Also amazing.   Also had the grilled Caesar salad.  It's a whole romaine head grilled and served with dressing in the side. The grilling gave it an awesome flavor.  Our waitress, maria, was very attentive and informative.  Also they had great bar specials, $3 ballast point sculpin  ."}
{"text":"This is a Friends knockoff. Limited menu, cold beer, two guys working on a Saturday. 
The home made chips were limp and tasted as if they were made with last weeks oil.
If you remember belmont food and beverage, this is the dumb cousin who took it over."}
{"text":"Welcoming and delicious. As we walked in a couple people (regulars, more than likely) sitting at a little table outside gave us a friendly greeting. Then as we walked inside and made our way up to the bar another regular welcomed us. Once we were seated the bartender came over with a warm smile and took our drink order (Kona Pipeline Porter on special for $2.50!). We were starving after doing renovations all night and asked if the kitchen was still open. It was around 9:50 and I suspect the kitchen closes at 10:00 but they more than happily made us food. The menu is small but has a nice variety. Apps, salads, sandwiches and a few entrees if memory serves me right! I noticed a chalkboard with dinner specials on it. The nights's feature was smoked 1/2 chicken with 2 sides. We opted for a Caesar salad, barbalo wings, sweet potato fries and a chicken jalape√±o flatbread. Everything was fresh and delicious. The flatbreads are where it's at though. They are bigger than you would expect. That goes for all their portions which are more than reasonably priced. Next time you're hungry and in Belmont give Supply a try... I just may be one of those guests at bar giving you your warm welcome ;)"}
{"text":"Great food, good selection of local craft beers,'very spacious and sleek design. Service was good. Wake up GASTON COUNTY this place is great."}
{"text":"Brand new. Great space and awesome atmosphere. Wings are amazing - BEST in Belmont. I hope they add more food options as they grow. Definitely a great addition to Main St. Belmont. 

^^So I wrote the above a year ago hoping for progress but I'm SO surprised to see they've back tracked. The menu is even smaller now and they've removed all of their delicious entrees. What's the point in having all of the space to only serve bar food?"}
{"text":"The crab cake and the spinach salad were delicious!! The fusilli with baby spinach wasn't bad but it was bland."}
{"text":"Great place with decent selection of beers and spirits and a great menu. I'm surprised by how few people are in here compared to other places in Belmont with inferior quality. The food menu while smaller than most restaurants offers exceptional quality and good portions. Sat and sun they do a brunch. It's terrific. Would recommend this place to anyone wanted above average food and a good drink."}
{"text":"Got my order wrong. Took over thirty minutes to get the wrong order to me and it wasn't crowded. Same old bf&b. Just different name."}
{"text":"This is a decent restaurant near the Liberty campus. The food was pretty good though you get what you pay for when you have steak under $20. The service was very nice and this a place we would come again because it's not super crowded and pleasant inside."}
{"text":"This fine place is just off Belmont's Main Street. We love the food and drinks there -- and especially its inviting setting. We've had nice dinners there and thrown a couple of big parties there recently."}
