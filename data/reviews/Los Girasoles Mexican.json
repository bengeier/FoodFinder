{"text":"I like this place.  I heard it was under new ownership, came here while in town to see it is was still as good.  It is.  I recommend you give it a try,  good food and friendly service."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and staff!  The food is always fresh and delicious! The pricees are great and Monday Margarita night is just what I need after work on a typical Monday!!! Cannot say enough good things...you need to stop by for yourself!"}
{"text":"Stayed at Merriot Hotel for 2 nights, and i saw this Restaurant. Never been at this restaurant before.  No wait. Friendly staff,  The food was delicious. I got the rib eye steak  and on top they add cheese and chorizo( yummy! They give you  rice and salad with it. My husband got the fajitas, was really good. Comes with beans, and salad.  My kids got hamburgers and fries and they were good too. For me this place got 5 ,  Definitely will come back again if have opportunity."}
{"text":"Disappointed every time, they're tacos don't even come with salsa. I got the cheese dip once and it was so watered down it was almost inedible."}
{"text":"Ugh! From hostess, to 15 minutes for a waiter, to mediocre at best food (flautas were blandly acceptable).  Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Los Girasoles is your typical neighborhood Mexican restaurant complete with their Vallarta Special and Combination Dinner #17. But they do a good job at it.   Los Girasoles is a rebrand of Salsitas which was in this same location for years. They spruced everything up and replaced much of the kitchen equipment while keeping the same friendly staff as before.   Overall you get what you expect here and they generally provide a consistently good experience and all of the carbs you could ever want!"}
{"text":"If I could give half stars, this place would be 4 1/2. The salsa is great, food was good and fresh, staff was very nice. My only complaint is that the cheese dip was watered down."}
{"text":"This is a place full of cheer, great service, and excellent food. It's become a favorite restaurant of mine since I began spending a lot of time in Cuyahoga Falls.  My favorite dish is the Courthouse Special Burrito, a sweet and savory burrito stuffed with steak, chorizo, chicken, grilled onions, and cilantro. It rests on a bed of rice and is then topped with two slices of grilled pineapple and topped with their white cheese sauce. It's a good plate of food for just $10.50. Their fresh homemade salsa is nice and chunky, not watery, and their chips aren't terribly salty and unpalatable like they are at many other restaurants.  The margaritas are excellent and are served to your liking, over ice or frozen, with or without salted rims, and a slice of lime. They also have the \"Coronarita\", a margarita served with a Corona turned upside down so the beer mixes with the margarita.  Every time I've been here the service has been excellent and the food served hot and fast. The place is immaculate, the servers friendly, and the bright green walls add to a pleasant atmosphere that adds to a great dining experience."}
