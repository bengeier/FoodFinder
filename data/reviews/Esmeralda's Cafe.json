{"text":"one of the best carne asada tacos ever and only for a buck love this place"}
{"text":"Carne Asada and seafood OMG!!! 
Realmente delicioso... siempre que vengo a Vegas es un buen lugar para desayunar o lunch!"}
{"text":"The food is wonderful.  My favorites are the pupusas revueltas.  I did not give out the last star as the parking situation is challenging and they have mixed up my order a couple of times, but the food itself.. makes you want to come back."}
{"text":"Waited an hour for a burrito and pupusas, waitress said it would take another 15 minutes.  Began to walk out when the owner asked us to stay for a few more minutes and said she'd give us a discount.  It was a $3 discount."}
{"text":"Nestled through all the junky store fronts on charleston is Esmeraldas. We come here about every two weeks. The staff is super friendly. There's always a soccer game playing if that's your deal. The place is usually full of families and Hispanic bachelors. I don't blame them - the prices are fair, the food has been excellent every time. It's listed as mexican, but it's also salvadorean, which means they have pupusas. I highly recommend the chicharon y queso (pork and cheese). They're only a buck fifty. Same for tacos. The carne asada quesadilla has been tasty everytime. The meat entrees are good too. A large size dish. They have a selection of beers. Seafood which I have yet to try, but will soon. I don't need anything fancy, just good food."}
{"text":"Longtime downtown spot on 10th and Charleston. Salvadoran and Mexican. Nice, big place inside with comfortable seating and good service. We had all the pupupas, cheese, pork, been with cheese and a combo of beans, cheese and pork. Really sumptuous pockets of corn based dough. Be careful, the fillings are hot. Served with a vinegar slaw and tomato sauce. Mammon, good. Did I mention they were $1.50. That's no typo. Tamales are a buck fifty too. The Elote tamale is a sweet, light bundle of yum. Beef burrito, enchilada style with rice and beans all tasting great - $6.50. Beautiful shrimp enchilada with tons of decent sized shrimp. We ended our meal with Fried plantains that were served with a sweet cream sauce - so good. Highly recommend for downtown eating."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time looking for authentic pupusas and was definitely not disappointed! We got the pupusas de revueltas and the platano with crema and frijoles. Everything tasted delicious. Great customer service and prices!"}
{"text":"The best dish here is the pupusa. This is a traditional Salvadoran dish made of thick, hand-made corn tortilla. As well as the waitress, Elena. She looks like she is made of thick, hand-made yum."}
{"text":"Always good.  The service is friendly and fast.  We get the pupusas with pork and cheese which are a great value at $1.75 each.  Sorry I haven't left a review earlier!!"}
{"text":"I ordered pupusas mixed with cheese and camarones al diablo, Camarones come with beans and rice. best pupusas in town.
Service was ok. 
Coming back for pupusas:)"}
{"text":"Prefect price, attentive service, delicious food.

We are visiting from out of town and wanted Mexican.  Found this restaurant on yelp and thought it was worth a look.

So glad we came! Our waitress talked us into a salvadorean pupusa revuelta, and we loved it with the tomato sauce and the curtido (cabbage similar to vinegar slaw).

Enchilada and burritos were very good.  No chips or salsa are served here."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start, I'm just glad it ended. WORST Mexican food I have had in a while and the service was atrocious. 

Now, most place Mexican places have a little chips and salsa to get you started, but this place didn't. That was OK though, because it was lunch and I didn't want much. It should have been an indicator of what was to come.

After about 10 minutes a waitress finally came over and I ordered a three item combo because I wanted to try a sampling of their fare. I'm glad I did because I don't think I could have eaten a whole plate of one food item. The enchilada had terrible sauce (possibly previously frozen), the carne asada taco was the smallest ever and the tamale was as bland as can be. Beans were awful, but I can say that the rice was OK, but that's about it. Oh, the tomato was great though! 

So, I finished what I could manage to and started to finish reading the CityLife mag I got on the way in while I waited for the check to come. Well, I read the WHOLE THING and never saw anyone! I got up and went up to the counter to pay. I saw why my check never came. The WHOLE staff was standing around laughing and texting. No wonder!

I paid the bill and left without a tip and I ALWAYS tip at least 15%, sometimes 10% if the service is really bad. Ouch!

Needless to say I won't be back because there are plenty of great Mexican food establishments in the area."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to have lunch near his office and opted to try something different. I figured some of the best ethnic food comes from the hole in the wall places anyway. We walked into the restaurant and were greeted by the hostess and promptly seated. The interior looked classy and was quite spacious.  We decided to try several of their pupusas ($1.50 ea), in addition I had the chicken enchiladas and my husband had their carne asada burrito. The pupusas were very good, and a steal for the price. The rest of the food was not anything special that would warrant coming back.

The service was non existent after our food came out. I ran out of water and pushing my cup damn near off the edge of the table I guess was not enough of a hint that I would like a refill. There were no signs posted that you're suppose to pay at the register anywhere in the restaurant, and maybe that's not the standard procedure, but we ended up going up to the register to pay. It was a fairly inexpensive lunch with solid pupusas and non existent service. I would not go back."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was the thing that made me give it 3 stars. Asked the waitress if the tacos were street taco style or more home made style, she gave me a completley stupid and dumbfounded face. Which annoyed me to no end, but whatever. The food was decent, ordered a burrito and it was super dry.. they just stuffed meat in a tortilla and rolled it up, no beans or anything. The meat was good and the carne asada had great flavor. The salsa is very watery they might wanna fix that."}
{"text":"We had an amazing meal and a wonderful experience here!  The food is authentic and delicious. The owners and staff are super friendly and eager to have you enjoy your meal. And the price is so reasonable."}
{"text":"I still remember going to Esmeralda's as a little girl. My mothers boyfriend at the time was Salvadorian so we would frequent it a lot back in the late nineties, early two thousands. Not a lot has changed since then. 

I still come from time to time, sometimes I call in an order and pick it up for lunch. I don't work too far so it's a cheap, convenient meal. The pupusas are really good and a steal at $1.50 each, although I do prefer the revueltas versus the other filling options they offer, they come with a red salsa and curtido (chopped cabbage in vinegar). The platanos fritos con crema y frijol are also really good, I love dipping the plantains in the beans, it's mix of sweetness and saltiness that I can tolerate without being grossed out. To wash your meal down, I recommend an ensalada. It's a homemade fruit drink with little chunks of apple. 

I've never had a problem with service, there is normally a sweet older lady that hands me my order, other times, a younger woman replaces her, let's just say she's not the friendliest, she's very cold in comparison, doesn't smile, and just seems miserable, but she is never rude."}
{"text":"Pupusas!!! 

So many kinds to chose from chicharron, shrimp, cheese, beans..etc.......


I had the shrimp and pork pupusa..topped with the salad and hot sauce. Delicious!!!

Fried bananas to end the meal was just what was needed. 

Authentic to say the least!"}
{"text":"Great pupusas! The bean and cheese (with lots of curtido) are my favorite. I also love their chicken sopes/gorditas. I usually get take-out because the restaurant itself isn't great. They should replace their dusty, fake plants with real ones and turn down the music. Until then, I'll just call in my order. :)"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for pupusas. I'm Mexican but I love my pupusas, LOL. Great and quick service. Super affordable pricing and most importantly the restaurant is clean and has a welcoming atmosphere. They offer Mexican and Salvadoran dishes. The girls are super friendly and attentive. I'm glad I found this hidden gem in town!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Very authentic. Soups are excellent. Been here several times.
Hidden in a strip mall. Don't be fooled by location."}
{"text":"Totally unexpected, in a good way.  First, its looks and a lot of its menu are those of a typical (at least as far as places I know in NYC) Mexican diner, but the staff is Salvadoran.  In addition to the tasty Mexican staples, they are serving up an array of other Latin dishes that make great comfort food, even to those of us who didn't eat them at home.

I had chuletas with rice and beans, as well as some shredded beef tacos, either of which I would recommend to anyone.  Entrees come with a choice of tortillas - go with the handmade ones, you will be as pleased as I was.  GF got the enchiladas, which she was pleased enough with to not offer me a taste.

Portions are a bit large in my opinion; just don't over-order and you'll be fine.  Everything was positively inexpensive, so when you need a fill-up, come to Esmerelda's."}
{"text":"I am giving them five stars while also recognizing that the service is a little bit slower. However, because this is something I am now aware of, I know that if I want delicious pupusas, I am going to have to set aside a bit more time. 

Overall, the atmosphere is very casual. The good is delicious and very well priced. Chips and salsa always hits the spot. If you stick to a couple pupusas (which also come with the yummy red sauce and the slaw), you can have an entire meal under $10, which is great. 

Again, just assume that it is going to take a little bit longer and you may have to flag down the waitress to get the bill. It is what it is...and totally worth it for the food."}
{"text":"I love the bean and cheese pupusas with cabbage salad.  Don't be fooled by the outside of the building. It's actually really nice inside."}
{"text":"This restaurant has great Caldo De Res. They add yucca and it's always great. Especially when not feeling well, this soup reminds me of mom. Great customer service as well."}
{"text":"Love this Place ever since my Uncle Brought me here I bought the carne asada Burrito and loved it although the food took 10 minutes to get to me it was worth it"}
{"text":"This little restaurant is about a mile from the old Vegas strip. The food and service is incredible. Make sure to order a Torta de Milanesa."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident while looking for somewhere to eat after The Color Run. The shopping mall where it's located has much to be desired but we were willing to brave it in exchange for authenticity. We were afraid they wouldn't allow us in because we were covered in color but were glad they let us stay and wash up a bit. 
At first we were not impressed when they brought us our complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were thick and hard and the salsa was very watery. I ordered the shrimp enchiladas and my husband ordered the carne asada burrito. We shared 2 cheese pupusas. The enchilada was the best I ever had! The shrimp were abundant and so flavorful. The rice and beans were perfect! I barely had room to eat the pupusa but it was delicious, too. My husband said his meal was also surprisingly good. And the best part was that it cost just over $20 WITH tip!
We will definitely be going back frequently for some good, authentic Mexican/Salvadorean food,"}
{"text":"Esmeralda, you did me wrong girl.

I want to preface this review by saying that the pupusas here are delicious. With that being said, I will never return here because the service was terrible. I'm very sad that I'll never eat those pupusas again, but that is a sacrifice I'm willing to make. RIP Esmeralda's pupusas in my life. Read on about this tragedy.

My friend and I were on the way to a museum when we stopped for what we thought would be a quick bite to eat. The museum we went to is fairly new and I wanted to get there when they opened and get in line before it got too crowded. We saw this place was just around the corner, so we were like \"F yeah we want pupusas!\" so we ended up here. 

Upon entering, it didn't look too crowded for a Saturday around lunch time, yet we waited for a few minutes to be acknowledged. A woman finally saw us and told us to sit whenever. Okay! So, we chose a booth in their lower level seating area and the menus were brought really quickly. That was, I thought, a sign that we would be able to get our food quickly and leave. Wrong! The waitress came back about ten minutes later to take our drink order and we ended up ordering our meal to speed things up. We ordered two horchatas and two pupusas each. Easy. 

The waitress came back quickly with our horchatas(no water offered) and chips and salsa. Horchata was good and as expected, the chips fine and the salsa super watery(maybe that was supposed to be our water?). We were pretty damn hungry so we were into the chips and super watery salsa that dripped all over the place when you tried to scoop some up. Anyway, the chips vanished quickly and we were left with an empty basket and salsa drippings all over the table. We chatted for what seemed like forever until we started checking our phones for the time. It had been about 45 minutes and no pupusas, no offering of water, no refill on the chips. 

One waitress quickly walked passed our table and said our food was coming. I thought maybe directly from El Salvador and that Esmeralda had made the food herself. I was still holding onto hope for an experience turn around. Ten more minutes passed and just as I flagged a waitress down, out came our food. Okay. No offer for refills on our nearly empty horchatas, no water offering either, but she did take our empty sad chip basket away. 

Now like I said, the pupusas were so good. I ordered a cheese and a chicken one and they were both amazing. My mouth is watering just thinking about them. The dough was thick but the filling was a plenty, so there was a nice ratio. Piping hot and super satisfying with the curtido on top. Soooooo good, but were they nearly an hour's wait good? Maybe without the sucky service. 

I flagged down the waitress once more for the check because we had to go. I let my friend have the last sips of my horchata since she was practically choking and we had no drink left. The waitress said I needed to pay at the front, so I went up to the front area and waited for the group ahead of me to pay. I also noticed another waitress ringing up another party on the other side of the counter and he was complaining about the long ass wait for food, so it wasn't just us. I thought \"maybe just a bad day\" and proceeded to get my total(about $12) from the woman at the register and hand her my card. \"Declined\". Nope and I told her as much. She tried again. \"Declined\". So, this annoyed me obviously, but I remained calm. I explained that it was not declined but she could try another card. That didn't work either. She tried one of her own cards and that didn't work. Yeah, not declined, yo. 

So, we find out the credit card machine is having issues. I have no cash, so I asked if she has a manual credit card machine(you know, the old school carbon copy crunchers?). She said no and runs off to check the power or something at the far wall. I stood there a bit dumbfounded for a few minutes because this experience is bizarre. She comes back and tells me \"It isn't working\". Yep, got that. I said I could come back after I go to the bank later but I had somewhere to be. She tells me to go to the liquor store ATM a few doors down(and pay a fee? No.) My friend and I got into my car and drove off. Now now, calm down y'all because I did eventually pay(I don't mess with karma by being a heathen) by mailing them payment but I was not going to pay a liquor store ATM fee. Plus I was already late to where I needed to be after this jenky lunch experience.

To sum it up: Divine pupusas but I will never return. I did not feel welcome because the lack of customer service, the wait time was ridiculous, and I was genuinely put off by how the credit card machine issue was approached. Onto the next pupusa place."}
{"text":"Amazing food very delicious. The customer service is top notch the waitress is always on top of everything. Thank you the wonderful service."}
{"text":"Its actually a Salvadorean restaurant and not Mexican food. Its family owned and it offers a no frills dining experience. However the service is fast and friendly. In and out quick dining. Everything is prepared by a mom and her daughters in the kitchen and it has the feeling of a restaurant in a small Salvadorean town. Their Pupusas are the best in the city hands down. I constantly order them to go when ever I am in the area and their Tamarindo drink is made fresh everyday.  The pricing is fantastic: easily feed four people for about $20. If nothing else the pricing, Pupusas, tamarind and speed of service makes me a fan."}
{"text":"I've dined at this place a few times, and after my latest experience I thought I'd write a review.

The service is hit or miss, mostly miss. The waitresses just don't check up on tables. And your left on your own to guess where to pay.

Now on to the food. My latest dish I tried was the grilled steak topped with onions and some type of red sauce. It was absolutely delicious, and it was a good portion. The red sauce was not spicy and it had an interesting flavor. I was surprised. It was $9.99, and came with rice and refried beans, and a small portion of lettuce tomato and cucumber. 

In the past, I have had the shredded beef burrito served enchilada style (awesome), the shrimp soup (not really filling), and the machaca--seasoned shredded beef over fried eggs. The beef was good. 

I noticed they started serving chips and salsa. I wonder if they have been reading the reviews. Also, diet soda comes in a can with a side cup of ice. They have the coke in a bottle ad well. 

Haven't tried the pupusas yet. The beans are not remarkable but the rice is pretty good. My friend always says the portions aren't big enough, but he's a guy, so go figure.

This place is slowly getting better. It's never really busy so food doesn't take that long"}
{"text":"I love this place!

I love this place because of their popusas. I've had every kind and they are awesome! Everything else on the menu is good but I mostly go there for the popusas. They come with a side of veggies in vinegar. It goes best if you order chicharones con yuka as a side. Chicharon is pork and yuka is a type of  fried vegetable (it's not sweet or spicy, tastes plain sorta) which you can flavor with red salsa."}
{"text":"Great food,  I actually stopped to eat pupusas, which where really good.  Love the place deadly calm to have a morning brunch with good friends. I didn't give it a 5 star because their lack of service they don't really check on how your doing,  as for me they didnt come around to offer me water.  Could have been better."}
{"text":"There is potential in this location. The older lady sitting in the front greeting and seating customers was eating a big bowl of Cheerio's right at the front hostess counter. I was not impressed. We did not eat here because of this one unsanitary act. If this is ok, what is ok in the kitchen?"}
{"text":"This was the best Salvadorean & Mexican food I have had in a very long time.  I used to like Casa Don Juan as my favorite but now that I tried Esmeralda's Cafe, Casa Don Juan is in second for Favorite Mexican food.  The food here is just like they served down south in Mexico back in the 1970's.  It is Just like your Abuelita would make if you went to visit.  I had the Steak & Shrimp with Rice and Beans and a Quesadilla with the Shredded beef inside, it was delicioso."}
{"text":"The food was really good but I found it super irritating that they did not honor the restaurant.com gift card we bought. The owner took $10 off even though we had a $25 card and spent over $50."}
{"text":"Yuck.  Currently shut down by the health department for 54 demerits.  http://www.lvrj.com/taste/restaurant-report-april-18-147883175.html"}
{"text":"Really bad food ... Good service though... Saltine crackers are the best food here"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Service is always friendly, food is always fresh and the papusas are mighty fine.  Esmeraldas has been around since the mid 90s which means that they were around in Las Vegas before many of the existing Salvadorean restaurants today.  Check them out and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! We came here for pupusas so I cannot comment on the Mexican food. I ordered one cheese and one chicken pupusa and they were delicious! My boyfriend ordered the pork and he really loved it. We also got a side of fried yuca which was awesome, and a side of plantains, crema, and beans - the mix of this was great. I'm not sure if I'd like beans alone though. I enjoyed the food enough to say I will come here again. We left very satisfied!"}
