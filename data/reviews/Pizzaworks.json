{"text":"I really loved their healthy non-greasy affordable pizzas. I was extremely sad to see them close so quickly. Pizza Hut around the corner is double the price and for times the grease :("}
{"text":"The pizza is better than average (definitely better than something like Pizza Pizza or Dominos).  I had a pepperoni, mushrooms and bacon pizza and while it was tasty, I did find the meat a bit salty. The ingredients are fresh.  One pizza is probably not enough for two people if you are hungry. Prices range from $10 to $15."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. They make it super fast with everything fresh (pizza is done in 5 minutes). You can make your own or choose one of their signature pizzas. I shared a meatball pizza (10$) with my boyfriend.  It's small inside with a few seats at a bar type table or theres a table with seats outside.  They have take out and delivery also.  Definitely recommend trying it. Better than anything like Pizza Hut or pizza pizza."}
{"text":"This place was a let down. They have this machine that lets them cook pizza fast. After eating it, I can understand why. Their machine is not any different from other pizza machines. The only reason why it cooks so fast is because the pizzas here are TINY.   I've never seen a place that's so cheap with the toppings and even the dough. Some people like thin pizza and that's cool. But when it's paper thin, I really think someone's wrong. To top it off, they are pretty stingy with the toppings. We ordered a mushroom pizza and eggplant. As far as I can tell, they didn't put anything other than mushroom, tomato sauce and dough. WTF? Where is the goat cheese? The basil? The eggplant was a little better with the toppings and was passable. Still, this is a kind of pizza that I would feel hungry after eating a WHOLE pizza.   All this explains why they are able to cook your pizzas so fast. When your pizza is paper thin and you put next to nothing on it, of course it'll cook fast! If you need an example of good thin pizza, go to Famoso. They are thin but they are worth the $15 because they don't skimp on the toppings. Pizzaworks' pizza aren't worth $10. I'd pay maybe $5 for this crap at most. Heck, I'd even consider Pizza Pizza over this place if I was hungry."}
{"text":"The guys that work here are really friendly.   You can expect fast and fresh pizzas made right in front of you. We ordered the pepperoni and salmon pizzas. I don't eat seafood, but was told that the salmon pizza was delicious. The pepperoni pizza was quite good, too. I prefer my pepperoni thinly sliced, but it was cut thick. You can try ordering  whole grain spelt for the crust. The crust was thin and the pizza was very flavourful.   One of the guys even threw in complimentary raisin and chocolate chip cookies, which were AMAZING! So soft and chewy!"}
{"text":"Wanna see the droopiest, saddest, soggiest personal sized pizza of your life? Then visit Pizzaworks.  This was a huge disapponemt. So I'm just going to do this in point form, so I don't miss anything ..  - call at 8pm, Wednesday night for delivery. Get told the delivery guy just left.  Huh?! You're a pizza joint and don't do delivery at 8pm?  #fail  - walk in to pick up, and see a Quiznos oven. The conveyor belt style oven. You know, the kind in a mall food court.  #fail  -soggy, greasy pizza -dominos crust/dough -the eggplant pizza was super bitter. And I had 4 small pieces of eggplant on the entire pizza, the eggplant resembled sardines in looks and texture.'the spinach was gritty! #fail #fail #fail"}
{"text":"Boo. I'm not a pizza geek or anything but I was so disappointed with my Mushroom Truffle pizza. It had the tiniest amount of cheese and basil I have ever seen. The Smoked Meat pizza was a little better in terms of quantity of toppings. Our pizzas were also left sitting on the counter though there were three people behind the counter...apparently they were all very invested in listening to the cashier talking to another customer (who seemed to be complaining). We were handed our pizza as an after thought. Not cool. Prior to that service was excellent, wish they could've followed through."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed by my pizza. I ordered a pepperoni and sliced meatball pie. The pepperoni were small, lacking the requisite porkiness and saltiness (they were more sliced Slim Jim than Italian deli) and the meatballs were dry. The crust was bland and had the same rubbery/chewy texture as Pizza Pizza's.  I had been looking forward to trying Pizzaworks, given they claim they cook their pizza in less than 5 minutes in a superhot oven -- the way pizza is meant to be made. But that didn't show through at all in the end result.  On a  positive note, I did not find the pizza greasy and all the ingredients seemed fresh.  Sadly,  have yet to find a delivery pizza in this city that beats Domino's thin crust. (Okay, North of Brooklyn is way better but I can't always eat an extra-large by myself.)"}
