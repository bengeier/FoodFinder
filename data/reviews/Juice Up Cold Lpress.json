{"text":"Delicious!!!! Can't wait to go back to try more concoctions. Nice clean place, friendly staff and the juices are amazing! Well done JuiceUp!"}
{"text":"Yay!!!! We finally have a cold pressed juice place on the east side! I couldn't find anything about the store online anywhere but I heard that it opened so I went to check it out this morning. Turns out they are open every single day of the week and have a menu with a lot of variety!! So I added them on Yelp!
I ordered All In, which is a green juice. It was spectacular. They service the juice in large, glass bottles that they make ahead of time. It cost $10, which is pricey, but comparable to all of the other places in town. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time here and I loved it. I was craving some fresh, clean juice and I was given more! Their juices are so so delicious AND served in glass bottles! So cool!!! $10 May seem like a lot at first, but for organic fresh juice in a glass bottle, that is seriously a steal! They sell similar fresh juice at Whole Foods, but the bottles are plastic and not as many ounces! If I lived closer to Juice Up I would go every single day. I got the Shining Star juice and it's so good. I can't wait to come back and try more juices!"}
{"text":"Enthusiastic customer service, 1-day juice cleanse program recommended based on how I was feeling, and a taste test to see if I would be ok with the recommendations so he could adjust and makes notes. I'm from Los Angeles and this is the best beer juice recipe I've ever tasted. \"Ginger Snap\"... big fan! Can't say enough good things - thank you for the great recipes, comparable pricing and keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I went in expecting juice freshly made to order, but after looking at the menu and selecting my juice I was directed to a cooler.  (Did I miss something?  Because in the other reviews I saw pictures of delicious looking yogurt!) I was offered a sample which was very good, so I decided to go with it.  

The juice was very pricey at $10 but came in a reusable glass bottle . I'm all about supporting my community, and I love doing so, but I'd recommend the owners make their prices more competitive and offer juice made to order.  

The owner was extremely friendly and the place is super cute.

Try Boaz in Ohio city if you are in that area for the same amount of juice for $2.50 made fresh while you wait."}
{"text":"Excellent and unique blends of various juices, all organic.  Great people also.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"So cute!! A lovely little shop with amazing juice combinations and an owner who is as kind and passionate as can be. Nestled in with all the other restaurants and shops, this is a much needed addition to the area. She informed me they do seasonal flavors and she has some lovely ideas for summer coming up! 

I have family that is walking distance away and I am thrilled to have found Juice Up to get my juice fix when visiting. Thanks to Liz S. for adding them on Yelp! 

The owner allowed me to taste my choice before I purchased to ensure I liked it, which is wonderful! I had the Paradise Punch- delicious, fruity, and in a lovely/sturdy recyclable bottle!  I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Awesome service! Great selection of juices that are natural, organic. Juice cones in a sturdy glass jar that's reusable"}
