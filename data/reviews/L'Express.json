{"text":"The quintessential French bistro in Montreal. Still buzzing and still serving up classic french bistro fare.   As all the new restaurants in Montreal delight in serving ever more exotic dishes, L'Express stands out as a bastion of what a classic dinner in Montreal can be."}
{"text":"We came looking for a casual late dinner option for our first night in Montr√©al and we were not disappointed. We were offered and took a seat at the bar. There was a short 10 minute wait at 9pm (we should have called for a reservation prior to coming).  The main barman, an elderly gentlemen, took care of us. He gave us amazing recommendations for wine and food. We got the foie gras, duck confit and Toulouse Maison (house sausages); all of these were excellent. It was a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"I didn't make a reservation but they still have a table for me (party of three). The dishes taste good and the waiters are friendly. It's noisy only because there were so many people inside, not because someone was shouting. We ate a lot of bread and pickle (taste good!) while waiting for the entree."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5

The restaurant definitely needs a reservation - it's rather small and can only accommodate so many customers at once. L'Express has a large history behind the restaurant which can be seen on its restaurant walls: It seems that the restaurant group takes a wall portrait. The pictures date back to early 1980s which really surprised me.

The menu at L'Express is rather small - the three columns are in French / English / and Spanish or Italian ... I can't figure out the last column. Anyway, the prices are not listed on the menu so ask your waiter for prices, or have a look online on their website.

This is what we ordered:

Me:
Appetizer: Country Style Soup (Minestrone)
Main: Shrimp Risotto

Hubby:
Appetizer: Bone Marrow with Coarse Salt
Main: Veal Kidney in Mustard Sauce

Hubby took recommendations from our waiter who eagerly recommended the bone marrow and veal kidney as my husband is quite an adventurous eater. I would've loved to join him, but I decided to be safe and stick to shrimp risotto as I was pregnant.

After ordering, we were brought out condiments. Each table had a huge jar of cornichons (or are they gherkins?) which we were a little puzzled about at first. With no instructions on how or what to eat it with, we just waited until our appetizers arrived.

Hubby's bone marrow looked so appetizing! He definitely had a side of cornichons as well :D, and with the baked crostini, he told me that the bone marrow was delicious! Oh how I wish I could've had a bite! We thought the portions of bone marrow were very generous, as we had ordered bone marrow elsewhere and its portions were not very big at all, only bite size. It was our first restaurant (so far) that served whole pieces.

My minestrone soup was nothing out of the ordinary, but I really enjoyed it as I was pretty cold from the outside Winter weather (remember this was back in January). The soup definitely hit the spot and I finished the entire bowl without sharing with my husband :P. I was surprised at myself because I don't normally enjoy minestrone (I prefer creamier soups) but at L'Express, it was beyond my expectations.

Hubby's veal kidney arrived not too much later and at first, hubby enjoyed it very much. However, towards the end of his main dish, I think he was having a bit of trouble trying to finish it. It was creamier than we had expected, and the kidney were fattier portions of the veal. It truly was a French dish! The potatoes were definitely helpful in balancing the fattier flavours of the dish, but I don't think they were enough.

My shrimp risotto was delicious! The tables next to me kept looking over at my shrimp risotto... it was that good! The flavours were very well balanced and overall very flavourful! We couldn't really tell what the sauce consisted of but it's definitely worth reordering! It had generous portions of shrimp and other vegetables as well which I appreciated.

I'm a sucker for profiteroles and I'm always drawn to ordering them whenever I see them on the menu! The profiteroles at L'Express were heavenly, literally. It was so good that I had to stop myself to ordering another plate of them. The profiteroles were perfectly baked with a caramelized top- crispy on the outside while still soft on the inside while still being warm! The cold ice cream went perfectly with it and oh my goodness it really was heavenly. If you love sweet caramel like me, you'd definitely enjoy this dessert!
Overall, our dinner at L'Express was a very enjoyable one. I wish we had visited the restaurant earlier during our time in Montreal- we would've definitely been regulars! The service was slightly spotty - the restaurant was so crowded and busy that it took some time to get a hold of a waiter and put in our order. But the waiter that was in charge of our table was very friendly and helpful, and definitely didn't forget about us throughout our night. The restaurant, in my opinion, could've been a little cleaner, but with the wet winter weather and the number of customers in the restaurant, I think L'Express did a decent job of keeping the restaurant tidy and clean amidst everything.

In the end, our bill came to something near what we would pay at a higher priced ($$$) restaurant. I don't remember the exact numbers, but it wasnt anything outrageously expensive for the quality of food and experience we just enjoyed. We would highly recommend the restaurant to anyone - those visiting Montreal, locals looking for a new restaurant, those going out on a romantic date, family reunions, for late night eats especially as it's open until 2-3am! It's going to feel like you are transported to France for an authentic French meal."}
{"text":"Make a reservation because if you don't you will be told to wait an hour by a man who thinks he is better than you. The hostess made the experience so bad that when we came back to eat (came back for the time we were told and we still had to wait) the entire experience left a nasty taste in our mouths.  Don't bother wasting your time."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic.  It was so nice that my wife and I ended up here both days of our two day stay in Montreal.  The first visit was late night for a couple of drinks and a bite to eat.  The second visit was for a longer lunch.  On both visits we sat at the counter which was great.  The service was very good and it was actually really enjoyable to watch the staff at work.  The older man behind the bar late night was mixing up some great classic cocktails for us.  He was very nice and funny as well.

The food was delicious and felt simple and homey.  The best part of the place was just how relaxed it was.  It felt like you could relax there for as long as you wanted and you would never feel rushed or pressured to leave. This was such a nice change from New York where it sometimes feels like they are trying to turn the table over as soon as you sit down.  It was extremely comfortable here.  We will definitely be back on our next visit!"}
{"text":"Their menu out front doesn't show it, but this restaurant also serves breakfast, which can be a lovely and inexpensive way to enjoy the ambiance of this special resto.

The breakfast menu is very simple fare, and everything is a la carte.  Choices include baguette, croissant, rillettes, slices of emmenthal cheese...  each range an average of around $2 - $4, and you just add up the ingredients you want on your breakfast plate.  If you're looking for creative combinations of eggs benedict, plates lavishly decorated with fruit or hangover-healing heavy doses of grease, this is not the place for you; potatoes don't even appear on the menu.  But the simple food they do they do very well.

If you're dining with a few others, I would suggest (as I will be doing next time) ordering plates of tomatoes, cheese and rillette to share along with your toast and eggs.  Otherwise, if you order it all for yourself, you'll be faced with the equivalent of one whole tomato, 6 slices of cheese for your modest - though perfect - slice of toasted baguette.

The fruit cup last saturday was especially nice - a pretty verrine of strawberries, oranges and grapefruit.

On a Saturday morning, it was packed; reservations are strongly recommended."}
{"text":"Tetes de violon, mackerel, pieuvre aux lentils (all three are appetizers) followed by risotto de homard and les rognons. The only disappointment was the risotto. Although I was pleasantly surprised at its lighter than usual consistency, I felt it was light on taste and the chef was heavy handed with the frozen mixed vegetables."}
{"text":"i looooooved this place. went in a big group and got wonderful service. i was very hungry and worried the portions would be mega-french style aka tiny portions. i was proven wrong!! really worth the prices here. 
i highly recommend the burrata salad. DELISH. i didn't love the lobster risotto but my partner didn't. the steak frites was also wonderful. 
one star off for me asking the waiter a recommendation for dessert and getting the apple tart - which was gross. no one at our table even touched it. they still charged us for it. oh well."}
{"text":"If you're looking for completely old school French bistro - take a seat.   A classic opener of marrow bones with coarse sea salt was positively unctuous. This restaurant has a well-deserved reputation for its steak tartare which was perfectly seasoned and  just a bit spicy. The poached  salmon was beautifully and simply cooked and them served atop chervil mashed potatoes surrounded by a classic lemon beurre blanc. 
Great food, knowledgeable staff, interesting wine list and a very nice selection of local cheeses to finish - all for a very reasonable price.
This is a great Montreal landmark and restaurant whether you are looking to show off great food to out of town guests or just looking for a \"classic\" night out."}
{"text":"Delicious food. I had veal which was cooked perfectly. It came with a delicious fresh salad. Great old fashioned vibe. Wonderful experience. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place was great.  We asked a stranger on the street for a lunch recommendation and she pointed out this place and said it was her favorite.  Walked in and the place was nearly empty.  They asked if we had a reservation and we almost left.  But they made room for us and 15 minutes later the place was completely full.  The food and service was excellent!  .  It has been over a year since we were there and we still think about it.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"L'Express is an institution in Montreal, and in the words of our hotel concierge, they serve \"very very traditional French\" which I guess makes sense considering this is on St. Denis, which is apparently the more \"French\" side of the city.  Decor is a traditional French bistro with the ornate bar and the black and white checkered floor.  The food and service here are outstanding, and its no wonder this place is busy all the time.  Like many other places in Montreal (with the exception of L'Assommoire), this place did not have a cocktail list but I went with the Sidecar which was excellent, and served in one of those old tiny martini glasses that I love.  Again, like Club Chasse, would have ordered another if I only had the time. 

To start:
Arugula with gruyere 
Duck rillettes (duck liver pate) 

Entrees:
Wine: Pomerol Bordeux, 2005, Chateau Du Grande Chambellan (merlot/cab blend)
Special - Duck with figs -- duck was succulent, juicy, rich, expertly prepared.  Why am I not surprised?
Hanger steak with frites 

Dessert:
The dessert was, quite simply, out of this world and like no other dessert I've ever had.  Leave it to the French!  It was the Ill flotette au caramel and was like a crispy carmelized dome with merengue filling and in a creamy sauce with crispy waffle pieces on the side.  Absolutely amazing!  You must not miss this.  Have to order. 
Cafe Latte -- best latte of my life! I knew it would be incredible here, that's why I ordered it and it did not disappoint.  Wish I could eat here more often, I would love to try sooo many more things on the menu. 

Writer's note: I have a confession...I did not discover this amazing life changing dessert on my own.  I saw it in a YouTube video where some girl ordered it and knew I had to have it. Here's the link if you're interested...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqsfYS0snbU"}
{"text":"Do not fill up on the bread and butter. Strongly recommend the steak tartare, and the foie gras is a must. My wife and I split those two dishes and we both left uncomfortably full. Wait staff is very helpful and made excellent wine pairing suggestions from their extensive wine list."}
{"text":"Gralhggha. That's the sound of me salivating over the thought of their bone marrow appetizer. It's sooooo good. Sinfully delicious hunks of bone marrow with crunchy toasts and coarse sea salt. That may have been the best thing I ate in Montreal.

I also had a very competent duck confit salad, while my friend had the beef tartare. Both were very tasty and well-executed, but neither was knock-your-socks-off amazing like the bone marrow. Mmmm, bone marrow...

The dessert, however, wasn't that great, even if it was a spectacle. We ordered the floating island, and when it came out, our server actually wished us luck in finishing it. It was giant. But the problem was that the island was encased in a hard shell of caramelized sugar which was overwhelming and not that tasty, and there wasn't much of an ocean for the island to float in. 

The service at this place was also great for the most part. Very smart and very professional, even though it was packed. I feel like I should also mention that my friend and I were clearly the youngest table that we could see. Granted, we're college students, and most other tables looked like older businessmen..."}
{"text":"Saturday dinner for four, reservations booked about 5 days ahead. The place was still bustling when we left around ~12:15am. We were shown directly to our table when we arrived, with the waiter removing a \"Reserved\" sign from a table near the front windows of the restaurant. Ah, a good signal.

Service was snappy and on point, keeping everybody happy while not being over-obtrusive. We felt like we got a little attitude at the start (being four American males in their mid-20s), but the service warmed up quickly. Recommendations were excellent and the waiters were knowledgeable about both the dishes and the drinks. 

For appetizers, we had the rillette, chicken liver mousse, ouefs in mayonnaise, and a good cheese salad. As a devotee of salty meat and fat, I got down mainly on the rillette and the mousse. The rillette was rustic and flavorful, with a chopped texture that had just enough creaminess to allow you to spread it over toast. A rich, gamey pork. The mousse was probably the highlight of the meal; one of the best dishes I've had in a long time. An ethereal, fluffy emulsion of savagely herbacious fat. God, I love it. I did not sample the other dishes since we had a vegetarian with us, and I did not want to eat his appetizers, but he had nothing but good things to say. I will also point out that they were very accommodating, making many suggestions to him.

Dinner was the duck confit over a salade verte. While the duck was spectacular, with wonderful contrasts between the creamy meat and crispy edges, I was most surprised by the greens. Fresh, flavorful, high-quality greens can bring a salad into another stratosphere. These slightly bitter, crispy greens, dressed lightly in duck fat, were perfect.

We had the creme caramel and maple syrup tart for dessert. The creme caramel was mediocre, with a kind of flabby quality. Not much flavor in the sauce, either. The tart was delicious, but I thought the crust was a bit dry and crumbly.

Dinner for four with three courses, two bottles of wine, digestifs, taxes, and tip was $270. A fantastic meal. Well-executed, classic bistro fare served with no frills or attitude, with great service."}
{"text":"Service was EXCELLENT!!! The food was ok..... I had the quiche. It was ok but it was buried under a mountain of green salad that lacked flavour.... You could feed 3 cows off the amount of salad that overflowed my plate that made for disappointing presentation --- it also lacked flavour as the \"dressing\" was just olive oil. But what they lacked in food the they made up for in their excellent service.... Our waiter was fantastic."}
{"text":"Still one of my absolute faves for bistro food in MTL. Food is v solid, service is pretty good (okay, not great) and prices are full but not outrageous with US$/Cdn$ exchange rate right now. Pretty amateur hour that they jam parties of three onto a two top, but at least they seem to be consistent with that (crappy, screwed up) policy."}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent meal.  I love Montreal, it's one of my favorite cities and in all my trips I couldn't believe I hadn't been here.  We started with the delicious bone marrow and I had the quail which was perfect.

Serve was very pleasant, and very French, but I like that."}
{"text":"Great service and ambiance, awful food the one time I've eaten here. The chicken with mustard sauce was bland; the sorrel(?) potage was unimpressive. The butter was too cold to spread, and the bread just average bread. 

Might give it another try, but only because of all the other glowing reviews here."}
{"text":"Very French bistro with excellent food.  Be prepared to practice your French (if you wish) or ask for the English print out of the menu. I had the homemade raviolis (raviolis maison) which were delicious with mushrooms on the top. My husband enjoyed the fresh salmon. We topped it off with the Chocolate tart (tarte au chocolate). Very dense with a deep dark chocolate taste, which was delicious if you love dark chocolate.  Oui, would highly recommend but make reservations."}
{"text":"Best French late night bistro for a sexy first date (bring someone you want to impress/get into bed) Or simply go by yourself, they have a bar counter. Huge selection of wine and food. Authentic French bistro feel. Knowledgeable staff. I love the bone marrow, steak frite, lobster bisque and they give u delicious warm bread with delicious fresh butter and a jar of pickles! Their desert are very good as well. Fairly priced for the quality. Went about 5 times.. It never fails. Their consistency is unmatched. Their menu has been the same for years now. Expect to pay 40$/person if frugal or around 60$ +/person for let's say a 3 course meal with a glass of wine. Hope you go enjoy!"}
{"text":"L'Express is your classic French bistro, and nothing less. The service is the best you can get. They have an extensive menu with classic dishes such as tartare. Everything they make is simple but perfectly executed and this is why they maintain a 5-star rating, year after year. I cannot even recommend specific menu items because everything on the menu is perfect and beautiful, simple and classic. No experimentation here. The basics, and the basics done well. There aren't some items that are better than others. Go in, sit down, and enjoy every bite of whatever you may order!"}
{"text":"I am so glad that I don't have to deal with going to Paris to experiance this level of gastronomy.  Every bad review I have read about this place seems to come from people who claim to be New Yorkers - I haven't put a connection yet as to why but for the moment if your mail gets sent to zip code 10001 through 10282 and you summer on hampton beach, you might want to stay away from this place or risk comparing it to all the way more fabulous places in Tribeca and Soho.  All kidding aside L'Express is everything that it should be and nothing that it should'nt. On the two ocasions I have been service has been phenominal both from servers and bartenders.  That was also one of the chief complaints about this place - I haven't experianced it and I don't see how unless it was busy and someone was camping out and not realizing it.  Lets get to brass tacks... Food - Phenominal! Best Steak frites in Montreal, excellant thick hanger steak cooked to perfection (seared on the outside and mooing on the inside) with a rich herb butter: frites were also amazing, medium cut not to thin not too thick and not greasy at all.  Salad was perfect as an app and I was able to try the Ravioli of the day (house made) and it too was perfection.  So far I have only tried one wine on their list and thats all I have to.  One of the bartenders put me on to Brunel De La Gardine 2007 Cotes Du Rhone - modestly priced but it breaks the mold for young Cotes Du Rhone (in my humble opinion).  They tell me that there is an exclusive agreement between express and the Brunel house in France - meaning this isnt available anywhere else in N.America, currently I spend my time on the internet and in wine shops around the tristate area trying to make that NOT SO. Back to topic - For Dessert they have the typical brassarie faire of truffles and flans, my table elected the Chocolate truffles sold individually.  The concentrated chocolate flavor of one was enough to satisfy me as a molton chocolate cake, with alot less fuss.  A few things to think of before you go.. make a reservation because they are busy every night; get the bone marrow because they ran out of it last time I was there and I know it must be good;  go for wine, because liquour pours are typically measured as is standard in Montreal; try to get a drink at the bar and chat up the staff and bartenders - they are very friendly and helpful, even so far as to recomend other resturants for your trip. I love this place and I want to sublet a table for an entire summer!"}
{"text":"The food was exceptional here. Classic French food. Ever dish was impeccably executed. For starters, we had the chilled asparagus. For the main, we had a delicious lamb shank and the duck confit salad. Dessert was apple pie, French style. 

While the food was excellent, I found our waiter to be rude and inattentive."}
{"text":"I loved this place so much that I decided to share with the world the goodness that is L'express. Went here recently at the ungodly hour of 11:30 pm and feasted on the bone marrow, oeufs mayonnaise, cold asparagus soup, and lobster risotto, complemented by one of the cheaper red wines, a Cote du Rhone (chateau des vieux or something like that? 2009), which was surprisingly yummy. The service was very professional, the ambiance was lovely. An unforgettable meal. Thank you L'express! Thank you Montreal!"}
{"text":"Love this place! This is the place why I love Montreal! Love the atmosphere and foods are great. Nice server:)"}
{"text":"Perfectly executed old-school french bistro. Classy and sophisticated but not stuffy. Clearly popular as the place was quite crowded by the time we left. Reservations probably required.  We arrived early with younger kids and they were perfectly polite and friendly. Would probably be harder with children later in the evening, but that's true anywhere.

Raw oysters and celery rouemalade for starters. Oysters were salty and fresh. Roumalade was light and almost creamy (though no cream in it.) Duck confit salad, duck \"steak\" with figues, a hanger steak frites, and country vegetable soup for main courses. All done to a tee and couldn't be improved. The steak frites was truly standout for an old standby. And the duck with figs rich and flavorful for a winter night.  Soup was a thinner broth based one, in a classic french style. Not super hearty but flavorful. Desserts were a dense dark chocolate torte and an exquisite ile flotant with the whipped egg whites covered in a dome of crystalized caramel. Both exceptional!

A demi of red Languedoc wine complemented it all quite well and was reasonably priced. Well worth a visit for french bistro food done as it should be."}
{"text":"This is our go to French style bistro restaurant right out of Paris. 

L'express is an institution in Montreal. It can be very hard to get seats especially at the weekend. Don't hesitate to sit at the bar.

The food is varied , excellent and while not cheap represents great value for money. All the staff are very pleasant and knowledgeable about everything on the menu both food and wine. Do not hesitate to ask which wine do you recommend for the dish you choose.

We have had almost everything on the menu. Having done so we always find ourselves coming back to the bones and the octopus with lentils for starters. For main course I can't resist the veal kidneys mushroom sauce.

The desserts are also to die for. Again choose anything you can't go wrong.

I think I have been reluctant to write about this place for so many years because it is so good I almost don't want more people to know about it. It is already tough enough to get a seat last minute.

Say thank you David, for giving this one up!"}
{"text":"Tried our luck without reservations any luckily they were able to fit us in (party of two) but we had to leave by a certain time which was not a problem.  Point being, make reservations!

The service was very attentive and patient as I attempted to converse solely in French (they do speak English.)  This is what I was expecting when I have French Bistro.  The service was great and anticipated every need, the atmosphere so very french, the food -- a traditional bistro style.  A very good wine list, limited number of demi- bottles, no beer. 

My husband had the quail and I had the shrimp risotto which both were good-- but not earth shatteringly fantastic.  What was great was the little jars of cornichon pickles and spicy (like clear your sinuses mustard) at every table. 

And again, the service was so attentive, it made the average meal so much more special.  They do take Amex Ex"}
{"text":"Super restaurant.
Le service √©tait impeccable et l'ambiance plus que conviviale.
Typique bistro fran√ßais. Nous y √©tions un mercredi soir et le restaurant √©tait plein.

La carte des vins est impressionnante et on adore le pot de pickles sur la table!
J'ai mang√© l'os √† moelle en entr√©e et pris le tartare en plat principal. Clairement le meilleur tartare que j'ai eu l'occasion d'essayer. Enfin un endroit o√π ils ne gorgent pas la viande de mayo!

Je recommande fortement le resto et n'oubliez pas de r√©server!"}
{"text":"Very good, close to my hotel in Holiday Inn Mid- town, $8 CAD cab ride. 

Ordered: 

- Half bottle red wine, very good. 
- Foie Gras, good and not as oily as the I tried in SF. Enough for 4 people 
- Steak Tartare, good and fresh. 
-Quail with wild rice, juicy and flavorful. 

Would go again."}
{"text":"L'Express is located in a neighborhood filled with some of Montreal's best restaurants. The outside of the building certainly doesn't stand out but it was already packed when I got there for lunch. The portions were big for one person. I enjoyed the duck confit salad but I had to share the bone marrow since it was too rich for me. 4 stars."}
{"text":"I showed up solo on a Friday night, with no reservation, hoping to get a spot at the bar, which was full with \"reserve\" tags. Luckily the staff accomodated me with the condition that I wrap up before 7:30. I could not refuse that!

I had the chicken liver p√¢te with pistachios, pot au feu, a couple glasses of wine, and some conversation with other customers...fantastic...very helpful staff, suggested the menu items. Oh, the cornichons are really good, too!

No doubt I will return to L'Express whenever I can make my way back to Montr√©al."}
{"text":"Delicious food. We had the chicken and salmon and it was AMAZING. The restaurant feels very Parisian and the wait staff was friendly. Definitely what we wanted from a french restaurant in Montreal."}
{"text":"Very classy, excellent french cuisine. The service is A+. Very knowledgeable about the wine. Went twice. Great for 2-4 people. No loud music. Be prepared to pay a good amount though!"}
{"text":"Let's begin with a day spent at Atlanta's Hartsfield Int'l because of a canceled flight to Montreal and end here at L'express. On the recommendation of a friend, I found myself shimmying up to the bar at this restaurant in a pretty hip - albeit understated at night anyway - part of town. I made a reservation just in case, but was delighted to see several empty spots at the bar. Hy (pronounced Ee) immediately introduced himself and made a wine recommendation based on my mood, and once the meal was selected, suggested another to suit the palate. The meal was fantastic - truly. Having spent the previous weeks in Vegas and New Orleans, I feel qualified to say this. Hy recommended the fiddlehead fern to start and the lobster risotto, both specials in season. I'd never had fiddleheads and was delighted to devour a dish of almost tender asparagus-like tendrils in a delicately scented light cream sauce that was rounded out with bits of ham and slivers of toasted almonds. I could have called it a night after this dish but decided to stay for the main course - a risotto of sweet lobster and a confetti of zucchini, red pepper and tender peas. Once the plate was cleared, I asked Hy for an after dinner drink suggestion in place of dessert and we decided on his first idea, a viscous, sweet wine with a nutty finish. Dinner complete, a list of personal recommendations for other restaurants and place to check out in Montreal from him, I was sleepy with thoughts of what and where to dine next. 

*On a side note, I read with interest about someone's butter comment. Indeed, the butter at L'express is remarkably good and I'm ashamed to admit, I slathered it on quite think to the equally delectable bread. Perhaps the calories are better spent on one of the restaurant's myriad specialties though."}
{"text":"Went here about 7 years ago. A truly memorable meal of quail. I don't really have the finances to patronize every upscale restaurant around, but for me this was probably the best meal I ever had. Montreal is so romantic."}
{"text":"excellent, unpretentious French comfort food in a classic bistro setting. reserve at least a day in advance as the place is packed.

the bone marrow appetizer and the two mains of kidney and quail were perfection on a plate. service was efficient and friendly, the server translated everything skillfully"}
{"text":"My boyfreind snd I love thid place!when we want good french cuisines we come here! The tartar is hand cut wich is very important. The pasta is homemade .. i love the set up of the restaurant snd the floors.. you really feel  like your in france .. the waiters are very nice & so is the clientele. If your looking for a good supper with freinds ,first date.. you name it , its the place to be."}
{"text":"Coming from DC where Le Diplomate is all the rage, I was excited to try an excellent French spot with a great reputation...where I could actually get reservations. 

Everything here thrilled me. I love that this is a nice French place, but it is not pretentious. The atmosphere is upscale casual, emphasis on the casual. Our waiter was very attentive and was happy to answer our questions. The service, from the host, to the waiter, to the busers, was spot on throughout the night. 

We started with the special mushroom tart, which we split, and it was everything a good tart should be. The pastry was buttery and flaky, with that great browned taste. The cheese was savory, but subtle, and the mushrooms were an excellent balance to the rest of the tart. 

For mains, I had the house made ravioli, which has pork and veal with a mushroom glaze. The waiter did make sure that I was okay doubling up on mushroom dishes, which was a nice catch, but I was happy to have both and the flavors were distinctly different. The boyfriend had the special lobster risotto. The raviolis were incredible, the pasta was doughy and tender, the filling was so flavorful and savory, and the mushroom glaze was to die for. It had this deep, earthy flavor and I sopped up the rest with the amazing crusty bread. The lobster risotto was an excellent summery counterpoint. From what I saw on the boyfriend's plate and tried, the flavors were light, the lobster was generous, and he was practically licking his plate even though he said it was very filling. 

For dessert we split the chocolate tart. Of course the tart was a dense, intensely chocolatey experience, but the dark chocolate sauce that adorned it really made the dish. It was so dark and a little bit bitter that it made the tart even better. The crust was nice and thin, so it held together and had a nice butter flavor, but didn't get in the way. 

I ate here two days ago and I am still raving about it. It is not to be missed in Montreal."}
{"text":"Lively French bistro with excellent food.  We made a large order, and everything we ordered was good."}
{"text":"I almost hate to review this place, because so many people have given it a 5-star rating, and my experience was definitely less than par.

I'll keep it short: people clearly pay for the ambience (i.e., wonderfully traditional French bistro, where you can linger for hours, drinking wine and/or coffee, and enjoy some good food.) The meal was okay (steak frites), but I've had better for less.

If you're in town for a few days and want to give it a go, shoot for mid-to-late afternoon in between the lunch & dinner rush, and you may be able to get in without a reservation. If you're aiming for a dinner seating, book ahead a few days (at least)."}
{"text":"Very good food here!

We had the fish soup and salmon tartare as appetizer. Then we had the beef chicken stew and sea bass as main course.

Everything was amazing and waiters were attentive!"}
{"text":"I have a friend who acts as though every piece of food that enters her mouth has been a gift from the gods. She closes her eyes. She moans. It's quite the sight to witness (aka laugh at). I mean, I LOVE food, but I have never had that type of spiritual experience that she seems to always have.

That is, until I had the steak at L'express. Something came over me. I felt like Sally in When Harry Met Sally (but without the whole faking thing). Now it was my friend's turn to laugh at me. But you know what? I don't even care! That steak. Damn that steak. I will never forget you."}
{"text":"Came here with an out of town friend because we wanted an authentic Montreal bistro experience. From the moment we walked through the doors and were promptly escorted to our table we experienced nothing short of fabulous service. I ordered the sorrel soup and mushroom ravioli. The sorrel soup was so sorrely and smooth. Very green, delicious addition and not too rich. The mushroom ravioli was a real hit. Wonderful thin pasta in a glorious sauce. I sopped up as much as I could with the bread I saved to do just that. We couldn't resist truffles and coffee to round it all off. And under 50$ are you kidding me? Very reasonable prices for such a great meal."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a unique and beautiful interior and absolutely wonderful professional service! Ever so many good wine choices and the food was incredible. I got the Quail with Wild Rice and my husband got the Steak, both were delicious. Overall experience was a definite 5 star."}
{"text":"A fabulous bistro with perfect French fare, great wines by the glass menu, and the best cafe creme this side of Paris. We sat at the bar and enjoyed our waiter's attentiveness.

I can't wait to eat here again (and again)."}
{"text":"It's not bad, but its reputation is clearly greater than the actual restaurant. The food is pretty good, although can get downright below average when there are a lot of people there. The service sucks at times, other times excellent. Depends how busy they are.

The decor is cute and the location is decent. 

Overhyped is the best descriptor for this place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Montreal. There are meals that are easy to appreciate and appeal to simpler palates (like the delicious hangar steak),  and more adventurous but no less tasty (like the bone marrow). I like to eat at the bar,  and I have always found the staff professional,  knowledgeable,  and very polite and fast. I always trust my waiter's advice on meals and wine,  and they never lead me wrong. 

I've seen some reviews saying people read other reviews and expected more and consequently were disappointed.  I'd like to ask: what,  exactly,  where you expecting? If you expected an orgasm in your mouth and a super cheap bill,  you may be disappointed indeed.  But for consistently great classic French food,  served by knowledgeable staff in a cozy bistro,  this is your place. It's not as cheap as eating at a restaurant in my hometown,  but then again,  I've never eaten food this great in my hometown,  and I'm happy to splurge to eat and drink well. 

My tips: get reservations,  try a couple different appetizers (I love the pate!) and go for a dessert.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came here after we got denied at Au Pied du Cochon for not having a reservation. This is as classic French bistro as you are going to get. Solid French food, nothing fancy, but they excel at every dish they do. Had the Hanger Steak with frites and it was good. Nothing to drool over - a solid steak. Also had the duck confit and that was tender and full of flavor and came on a bed of greens. Appetizers were a mayo egg and chicken pate, which is highly recommended. Skipped dessert. A solid meal that reminded me of Parisian bistros visited in 2004."}
{"text":"Stopped here after reading the excellent reviews and I have to say this place wasn't even satisfactory. Overrated and may even be a tourist trap. I had the quail/wild rice - drenched in some sauce and the rice wasn't cooked properly. If I were to ever go back I'd probably order something less easy to botch off the menu, like the ravioli"}
{"text":"L'express is the most quintessential Resturant in Montr√©al. It perfectly encapsulates what dining in this city is, and should be. From the second you walk in the door, you feel like you're in France. The food is killer - specifically the ravioli. I have dreams about the ravioli. Very good prices. Impressive staff. Great private import wine selection (with prices for every budget). This is a place I will come to time and time again. After moving here 3 years ago for school - this is one resturant that has been one of my all time favourites."}
{"text":"Delicious, simple meal; attentive waitstaff; cool 1930s-esque ambiance.  

I had the sauteed duck confit with salad, and my boyfriend had the homemade raviolis.  The duck confit salad was fresh, delicious, and plenty for an entree.  Greens, sauteed green beans, radishes, bits of crunchy ham or canadian bacon, mini croutons, and a light vinaigrette.  I've been craving it ever since, and will probably attempt to recreate it soon, but I'm sure it won't live up to my memory.  The ravioli were light and tasty, filled with a mixture of pork and beef, I think, and surrounded in what looked and tasted like a beef or pork broth of some sort. We finished up with the orange creme caramel.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  

Plus, they bring a pickle jar to your table after you order.  Blissful!"}
{"text":"While the restaurant seems fancy, the people are generally unpretentious and the food is delicious. The steak tartare is HUGE, finely minced and delicious. They give you a big jar of cornichons to go with it which is oddly satisfying. The bone marrow is a must and I like how they cut the bone sagittally instead of lengthwise. Steak and frites were delicious as expected as well. Have gone here many times and will definitely go again."}
{"text":"the ambience is very French bistro (probably why it's called that!) with typical French food and excellent wine menu.  They had a lot of wines by the glass and there were many reasonable options.  We ordered:
- Foie gras - absolutely delicious.  It was so fresh and creamy and light.  The best foie gras I've ever had
- Bone marrow - I love bone marrow, but this was a bit disappointing.  I don't know what it is.... It was healthy portion and it was prepared very simply, which I like, but something about it didn't blow me away.
- Quail with wild rice - Quail was perfectly cooked and crispy and the wild rice was really \"wild\" rice, not some fake version.  Seasoning was perfect
- Pork and sausage ravioli with sherry sauce - reviews said their ravioli is really good because it's homemade, but I didn't really see anything special about it. Maybe I'm spoiled from all the NY Italian cooking, but I thought this ravioli was just good, not excellent.  Nothing about it was bad.  In fact, it was really quite delicious, but it just didn't blow me away."}
{"text":"My favorite bistro in all of Montreal. 
From the great hors d'oeuvres to the fabulous deserts, this is a spot you just can't afford to miss. 
Located in the French quarter, l'express is a small restaurant that is lays packed and full of eclectic people.
The food is amazing but be sure to order l'ile flottante before they sell out and don't forget the cheese and wine to finish off the evening."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome.  Had a full dinner here. soup to nut.... delicious.  And not that expensive for a full meal (app, entree, dessert, wine)... Went with 3 other people.  came to $35 a head tip included. 2 Bottles of wine and 2 shared desserts.  Must make reservations!"}
{"text":"I had a delicious poached salmon with chirvil mashed potatoes.  It was delicious.  We started off with a creamy chilly gazpatcho which was wonderful. Matched with a nice glass of rose and a lovely waitress."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of this restaurant.  Visits to Montreal absolutely suck unless they include a meal here.  

I am addicted to the Mouse de foie de voillaie appetizer.  Pure sex in a ramekin.   It's a mix of various fowl livers topped with pistachio's served with fresh french bread.  Delicious is an inadequate adjective.  

I am also addicted to their steak tar-tare.  It is difficult at best to find this classic in the States and nearly impossible to find it done well.  At L'Express it is exceptional.  I take mine extra spicy.  Served with impeccable frites it is a joy for my palette.  

On our recent visit we enjoyed Il Flotante for dessert.  A light fluffy meringue floating in caramel sauce.  This was the only sub-par item we had. The caramel chunks in the sauce were simply too large and unmanageable.  On previous visits these were broken into small pieces.  This was a small oversight but one the chef should address.

Service here is always impeccable albeit very formal and a bit stuffy.  In part this is because this is definitely a \"see and be seen\" establishment.  We dined next to a local news anchor although I must admit I didn't know who he was or what all the fuss was about.  

All told this is a fantastic restaurant.  If you're going to Montreal do not miss the opportunity to have classic French Bistro food done well.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here with my lady for a nice evening.  Ordered a bottle of wine and sat down at the bar, since the restaurant was so crowded.  I'm glad we did, because it allowed us to have a more casual dining experience and make friend with the nice older gentleman bartender.

I ordered the pot-au-feu and couldn't have been happier.  It comes with a bit of bone marrow which was delicious and just the right texture.  The veggies and meats were also perfectly done.  Overall, a really nice french experience."}
{"text":"Typical Bistro.  Food was ok.  We had steak frites, fish soup and quail on wild rice.  I actually preferred the wild rice to be more savory, so it doesn't remind me of the Asian (Thai/ Chinese) glutinous rice pudding.

Service was great and ambience is good."}
{"text":"Great food, everything was amazing. With every meal they serve a jar of pickles and Dijon! And though it might be a wee bit on the expensive side, it's worth it.The people  are really friendly there, know their wine and recommended a great one with the meal.   

The only trouble is that the restaurant is too pricey to be a regular restaurant and yet not expensive to be a high end restaurant. As such, there were a few faux pas, I was served first (both wine and food) and had to pour my own glass several times.  This, along with the cheap paper covering the table just made me confused. Nothing to ruin it, just a few small things."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. Extremely good pricing for the quality of the food. We started with the (in season) asparagus, the rillette and the bone marrow (a must try!!). Our waiter was attentive and recommended the perfect wines for our meal. I would return in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Have been coming here since the 80's.  It has not changed much at all since then.  It is classic and I have never been disappointed.  On this occasion we came for lunch and I had a really lovely shrimp risotto and my other half had the croque monsieur which was prepared in a simple and authentic fashion with awesome frites..

A lot of folks feel this place is maybe not what it used to be.  That has not been my experience at all.  However I would say that times have changed and the overall culinary scene in Montreal has elevated such that there are a lot of great choices and L'Express does not stand out the way it once did.  It does, however, remain on our short list of Montreal dining venues."}
{"text":"I think this place will be a consistent favorite.  It is expensive, but worth it.  I think you have to try it for yourself to believe.

Had the bone marrow, which is great, and a cod appetizer off their specials, which was okay.  Steak for entree was wonderful, husband got the scallops off the specials, which were great as well.  Our server was excellent, full of information and suggestions.  

Dessert was the tarte tatin -- warm with ice cream -- yum.  I had the dark chocolate torte, which is intense but also very flavorful.

I really like the atmosphere, the bar when you walk in, the cute bistro-type tables and chairs, and the way people are crammed in there gives it a cozy feeling.

The people next to us had their small child (5 yrs), and he looked both bored with his food and the location -- not sure if it is a good place for children.  It can also be tight on space for strollers, but I think they are accomodating."}
{"text":"Breakfast at l'Express 

I have tried locating breakfast reviews for l'Express but people seem only to be dining here for dinner. I can say only one thing: you are missing out!

Well, judging by the reviews, I'm the one missing out as I've never stayed for dinner, but I can say with certainty their breakfast is delicious and affordable. Although we're big fans of l'Avenue, Express offers a much different experience and price point. Their coffee is simply the best I've ever had in a restaurant. So much so that it can be enjoyed without milk or sugar (something I have never been able to appreciate with other coffee, with the exception of vacationing in Costa Rica). 

So the highlight has to be their French Toast (Pain Brioch√© Dor√© avec syrop d'√©rable). You're served two thick slices of brioche bread (think challah) cut in four, cooked to perfection: golden and soft on the outside, moist and warm on the inside. Real maple syrup is served, which is a must in Qu√©bec. My boyfriend always gets the three oeufs tourn√©s with baguette + bacon and a bowl of divine chocolat chaud. Last time we tried the pear compote, which is a small portion of a wonderfully smooth vanilla-caramel treat: mini spoon provided to indulge! 

We usually go mid-week, so it's never crowded and you feel like you have the place to yourself. Phone starts ringing if you're there close to lunch, but it's all part of the experience. This past time we joined them on a Saturday at 10:30am (they open at 10am on weekends for breakfast) and still were seated right away. The best part is breakfast is served quick so no long waits and bottomless (reg) coffee!

No name shows above the door, just the address 3927 so look for the checkered black & white entrance tiles below the cream-colored exterior and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ahhh... L'Express. It is truly the epitome of a French bistro from the menu, to the design to the ambiance and service. 

It's often deemed a \"must visit\" while in Montreal and I am inclined to agree. The food has always been stellar, they have a great selection of wines and the pickles and bread at your table are an excellent touch. I regularly order the ravioli and it has been a hit every time.

Definitely a great option for a low-key evening out without pretention, just good food and wine at a fair price."}
{"text":"Decent, typical French restaurant with good service. Their wine menu is extensive.

I wasn't a big fan of the bone marrow many people rave about. I think their menu items can be a hit or a miss, but they have a fair number of options. 

My favourite part was the dessert! They are known for the Floating Caramel Island (the dome-shaped one everyone posts photos of) and it did not disappoint. It was really fun and delicious to eat."}
{"text":"Very charming decor. Good steak frites and grilled salmon, but try elsewhere for tartares and the duck confit. Always great ambience and well tailored clientele. Courteous and professional staff and hilarious bartender."}
{"text":"We used Yelp to find a french restaurant while in town for a few days.  Let me say that without a doubt, it was the best french meal I have had. Like the other reviewers have said, no signs out front (unless you count the sidewalk) so it's a little hard to notice at night (especially in the rain).  The tables are dressed in white linen, but the dress codes varied from jeans and a t shirt on some diners to a suit on others.  Don't forget a reservation!!  The place got to capacity quick!  

Four of us dined together and we had: the lobster risotto, the roasted quail, the duck con fit and the grain-fed chicken in mustard sauce.  They were all simply amazing!  We ended up having to share with each other because of how fantastic everything was.  The salads were perfectly fresh, the vegetables were crisp and the wine list was superb. My best friend and I decided to share a half bottle, and the wait staff was kind enough to split the half-bottle on both of our tabs without us even asking! 

As for the wait staff, they were simply amazing. They were very courteous and even encouraged our poor french, so that we cold try and figure out the menu on our own as they stood by just in case we had questions. But don't worry, they do have English menus!  

The only negative (our fault)  thing I can say is that when you look at the dessert menu, pay close attention. My friend's wife and I ordered the Creme Caramel with orange thinking it would be like a Creme Brulee, but it was more of a thick custard, It was still good, and our own fault for not reading all the way, but just keep that in mind

I cannot wait to go to Montreal again so that we can have a traditional french dining experience at L'express!"}
{"text":"it's without a doubt the best french restaurant in montreal"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant in Montreal. It's retro, it's delicious and it doesn't give a crap if you like it or not (so much so that they dont even have signage. It's like saying \"maybe you'll find us, maybe you won't- that's YOUR problem\"). The food is elegant, sometimes simple and always delicious. The fish soup is a must, as well as the terrine de foie gras. I love the shrimp risotto, always perfect, always delectable. The waiters can be slightly snobbish and sometimes seem exasperated should you ask a question- but who cares! It adds to the French allure. The important thing is the efficiency and professionalism of these career waiters. This is the place I drag my friends for all major occasions; birthdays, holidays, celebrations, because it's Tuesday (girl's got to eat!). Word to the wise, reserve way in advance for groups of 5+ and don't be surprised if they stick you after 10pm."}
{"text":"Thank you for taking the time to read my review.  I had great expectations for the restaurant, food , staff and ambience.  Unfortunately, none of the above delivered.  The best was the expensive bottle  of Bordeaux that I ordered and had to pour for myself.  Stay away from the Crostini with the goat cheese salad, you need to have a direct line to your Dentist so that your teeth can be fixed after eating in this restaurant.  Govern yourself accordingly.

Do not look for the staff to ask you how your meal is, it doesn't happen."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch!  The pate, steak tartare and quail were delicious.  Service was also perfect."}
{"text":"Made a reservation an hour before we went (probably got in because it was a Sunday night in July) and then sat down to a wonderful meal! Read the reviews before going and I count myself as one of the new advocates! If you love French Bistro & are a foodie, you'll love L'Express!"}
{"text":"Heavenly foi de gras. Veal liver with mashed potatoes. Steak with French Fries. Red wine from Southern France.  Now I have to walk to the hotel to burn some calories.  Worth it."}
{"text":"so.amazing.  Our big night out was between here, and au pied.  I wanted to go somewhere a bit less, well known if you will, so chose L'Express.
The wine list, first of all, is bomb.  If I hadn't already been drinking previously, I would have had a glass of everything on that list.  Super A plus!!
The food was simple, but was an amazing experience.  We had the boiled egg, which was finished with a house made curry \"mayo\".  The mayo was rich, fragrant and decadent while the eggs cooked to perfection.  It was such a nice combination with the creaminess of the egg.  We also had the goat cheese salad, which consisted of layers of tangy cool goat cheese on toasted amazingness.  Heaven.  
Our entr√©es were equally delectable.  At the end, our bill was under $80. Can't do that everywhere!
Service was what you get in the old QC, but our back server (busser?) was super, super friendly and knowledgeable, and definitely highlighted the night.
I would totally come back, again and again."}
{"text":"L'Express

After all the reviews I'd read about this bistro, I was tre excited to try it out. The atmosphere was so lively and French! We were immediately seated because of my reservation, and our table was perfect.

We started with the foie gras, which was purely delicious. Then both of us ordered the raviolis. OMG, to die for! The sauce alone was worth scraping the bowl with bread, and the tender meat filling in the ravioli was bliss!

We ended the meal with the apple tarte a la mode.......perfect, perfect, perfect.

The service was slow, but friendly and thorough, so we loved our l-oooong meal. Do yourself a favor and go!"}
{"text":"The best meal I have ever had in my entire life! It was so delicious! My boyfriend and I both had steak frites (which it says Hanger Steak on the menu). Neither my boyfriend or I can speak French and the servers were very helpful/accommodating. They give you a jar of pickles and bread while you are waiting for your meal, which came out very quickly! The steak was very tender and flavorful - nothing like I've ever tasted! Give it a try you won't regret it!

You might want to make a reservation beforehand. We went in on a saturday night, and we had to sit at the bar. It wasn't the most comfortable, but it was worth the food!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Excellent!

We went there for early lunch. Made a reservation the night before, but we got there late because we had to drive 2 hours from Ottawa to this place.
Even though we were way late for the reserved spot, the host quickly sat us down at the bar. He even apologized that he couldn't sit us at a table. So curtious! 
Pickles were excellent - I don't eat pickles, but I ended up eating at least 10 of their sweet/bit of sourness cute little pickles. 

We ordered bone marrow and Quail on wild rice. Presentation was very nice and both dishes were very rich in flavor. I loved the quail A LOT! 
It was very tender and juicy and yet the skin was caramelized and sweet. The bone marrow was interesting, but definitely too \"rich\" (greasy taste) for me. 

I also thought the prices were quite fair. The quail was about CAD 18.
In LA, I'm sure that'd be USD 25-30 at least. 

We stolled a bit on St-Denis. Very nice street with lots of unique shops. Highly recommend this restaurant!! 2 thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast: simple food done just right, fantastic coffee and lovely atmosphere. The morning prices would fall in the $$ category rather than the $$$. Service was very nice, although the food came out very delayed (our waitress did come to us and apologized for the wait)."}
{"text":"Great food!!! Came from Toronto, and came here after reading all the reviews and all I can say is ...WOW"}
{"text":"Tasty, traditional French fare. Our main complaint was that we wanted more - the duck confit needed some carbs and the quail would have been even more appreciated sitting on a twice-as-high pile of wild rice.

The food was not exactly perfect, but satisfying enough, and the ambiance was great."}
{"text":"Although the atmosphere and service were very nice, the food was truly awful. We ordered the fish soup which was bland, the bone marrow which had a disgusting texture, the calf liver and the toulouse.  The calf liver was not cooked properly, the toulouse tasted like something you would get from a package in the grocery store, and the mashed potatoes were dry like they were from a package.

This place was not worth it at all. It was an awful, overpriced experience and I would not recommend anyone go there. I had a reservation to Maison Publique that night and I wish I had gone there instead. Or Burger King. Both would have been better."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for almost 20 years. It's my favourite restaurant!  Classic French bistro with great food. For a starter I recommend the ch√®vre chaud or the chicken liver p√¢t√©. For a main I get either the steak tartare or the hanger steak. Good drinks and wine list as well. Don't skip a chance to come here!"}
{"text":"We went for desserts and drinks and very happy we did.  Desserts were excellent and they had a fairly robust wine list for such a small place.  I ordered a 2011 Bordeaux from the Medoc region that was wonderful.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A bartender down the street recommended L'express for dinner -I did not have high expectations.  Was pleasantly surprised.  Greeted by an unhappy maitre de because we did not have reservations but we did get a table.  This place is so popular that people reserve bar seats.
Great wine selection .  Of course the menu is in french but thankfully they include translation.  They present a canning jar of pickled tiny cucumbers that were very good.  We had the fish soup and shrimp risotto both were great.  Service was impeccable.  
Will definitely make a reservation next time we are in town ."}
{"text":"Feels like Paris! Had escargot that was prepared out of the shell on top of potatoe pur√©e. The octopus with lentils was a creative combination. The hangar steak was on the chewy side. We asked for medium, but it was well done. The frit was amazing! Not like any other I have had! The bistro is a gem."}
{"text":"Maybe the best food I have ever had. The duck confit is amazing, so is the frois gras. If you are looking for delicious French Canadian food in Montreal, this is the place to go. It is not cheap, but the price is worth it."}
{"text":"After reading various reviews here we thought we'd give this place a shot.  The food was pretty good.  Warm goat cheese sandwich and a p√¢t√© serving big enough to give anybody a heart attack were the starters.  Nice bottle of wine, sea bass and home made raviolis rounded out the meal.  We were happy. 

What we weren't so happy about was the service.  Clearly something went wrong with our service as even the bus boy was coming by to apologize for the wait.  Between the appetizers and the main course it must have been about 40 minutes.  When we walked in with no reservations at about 7:45 the ma√Ætre d' told us there was a table in the front that was free until 9:00.  Ordinarily we eat pretty quickly so we figured with over an hour to go we wouldn't have any problem.  With the huge delay between servings we got out of there just in the nick of time.  

Regardless of what happened in the kitchen, the wait staff was pleasant and attentive, the food was good, if pricey."}
{"text":"This is my first time to taste risotto. Shrimp risotto is devious. Another serving is Bone marrow with coarse salt. My husband likes very much. The first taste is very good, but after I eat much, I feel a little greasy."}
{"text":"This place is excellent!  The service was great!
The duck confit is absolutely amazing.
Beets salad is delicious. 
Shrimp Risotto is creamy and perfectly seasoned. 
Loved the little pickle. 
I would of been a 5 stars - I took 1 out due to dessert was just so so.  
Perhaps I will try other dessert selection next time. 
Overall.  I am in love with this place."}
{"text":"Amazing meal. From the service, to the wine, to the food itself.

I highly recommend the foie gras and bone marrow to start. 

All the entrees we ordered were impeccable - ravioli, steak frites, chicken and lamb."}
{"text":"Paris √† Montr√©al. Toujours bon et frais. Serveurs professionnels. Bravo!"}
{"text":"A staple of Montreal,  my 10th time here probably.  Service is always old school excellent with knowledgeable and experienced servers. Paired with excellent bread and gherkins .. you order a bottle of wine and you are guaranteed a great next 2 hours.  Apps and mains are designed well. Traditional paired with special menu items that surprises. Desserts will please if you aren't too full already from the app and dessert. Just depends on what you order. Drinks menu is large and very reasonable prices. Again.. a staple of montreal"}
{"text":"this is french food, the worst I ever had.  no way this is a 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Decided to go to L'Express today for lunch after wanting to try this place for sometime. The staff were lovely and the restaurant had a really welcoming feel to it. The food was delicious although nothing 'out of this world'. Coffee was nice and I loved the tartelette citron! Dessert was certainly my favourite part."}
{"text":"Terrible experience in here. There is a waitress did a terrible job to us. Because she wanted to leave work and back home early, she made our order almost all wrong. Really really disrespect to her job."}
{"text":"The veal kidney I ordered didn't taste salted at all--but aside from that, everything was delicious. Service was great as well. I'm a sucker for any place that has exceptional bread and butter, and I almost screamed with happiness when they brought a huge jar of cornichons to the table."}
{"text":"Fancy and locally famous, but a bit overpriced and unmemorable for the quality. The neighborhood, Le Plateau, is similarly overrated. I ate here with my girlfriend and it was among our most expensive meals during a week-long visit to Montr√©al, but all we really remember were the cornichons and mustard served at the table--the rest was fine, conservative French cooking that disappears from memory sooner than it disappears from your credit card bill."}
{"text":"After Au Pied de Cochon, dinner at L'Express was the best meal I had during my trip to Montreal.  We managed to squeeze in here without a reservation on a Thursday evening. We were seated in a space near the back with an atrium ceiling and tables that were a tad bit close together. The waiter was very friendly and patient with our order, providing plenty of recommendations.

Foodnalysis:
- Bone Marrow - Amazing! A first for my husband and me. The jelly-like consistency and mushy texture is definitely an acquired taste, but if you enjoy trying new things, don't miss this. Excellent presentation, each portion served in the bone with the traditional toasted bread and sea salt.  Fantastic flavor.
- Steak Frites - Wonderful, classic dish.  Can't go wrong with this.
- Steak Tartare - Really, really loved this. If you enjoy tartare of any sort, do give this a try. The meat was flavored with just the right amount of lemon juice to enhance the natural juices.  

The Bottom Line:
Highly recommended French bistro.  Try the bone marrow and the steak tartare (if you're into raw!) or steak frites."}
{"text":"Amazing Bistro! Great for soloing at the bar too. perfect menu selection. Great wine list. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellente brasserie. Tout le charme d'une brasserie parisienne au coeur de Montr√©al.
Service impeccables, un beau comptoir, des plats succulents et traditionnels. Je recommande d'essayer le pot aux feu, et les os √† moelle."}
{"text":"I initially came across L'Express in United Airlines' Hemispheres magazine, which included the restaurant in its Three Perfect Days in Montreal article. When I saw how well reviewed L'Express was on Yelp, I put it on our \"must\" list, and am so glad I did. We had a lovely lunch there during a weekend getaway to Montreal.

The restaurant itself looks straight out of a Parisian brasserie, much to my boyfriend's (a Francophile if ever there was one) delight. The bar is mahogany, the floor is done in black and white tile, and the tables are covered with white tablecloths and paper - just as one would expect to find. We sat at the back of the restaurant where we had a good look at black and white photographs depicting the restaurant and its staff for every year L'Express has been in business, and were quite impressed to see how many employees have remained at the restaurant for 5+ years.

Service is slow, but one should expect that - the French do not rush through their meals the way Americans do (which means yes, there should be significant pauses in between courses, and yes, you should have plenty of time to review the menu before being asked to make selections). If you want the waiter, signal - he's not going to hover over your table and pressure you to leave the minute you've finished your plate, thank goodness. 

We did not have a reservation but should have made one - this restaurant is very busy, and if you don't want to wait, I would recommend planning ahead.

When it comes to food, I thought L'Express held their own. I started with the courgette soup, which was creamier than I prefer, and I detected what seemed to be bacon crumbles on top, which I could have done without. That being said, it was a delicious soup, and I was more than happy to polish it off with some wonderful fresh bread. My main course, the quail, was absolutely divine. It was accompanied by a beautiful balsamic vinegar over a bed of wild rice. My boyfriend and I shared the tarte au chocolat for dessert, and while it was quite rich, we really enjoyed it.

Quite frankly, I found the L'Express experience to be quite pleasant - it was certainly the most memorable lunch I had in Montreal this October."}
{"text":"Authentic french food that is fresh and light. I had the sea bass and my date had the quail.  The preparation for both dishes was very simple, but allowed the freshness of the ingredients used to shine through. My only complaint is that the sea bass had too much olive oil on the fish and the vegetable side. We sat at the bar and our server/bartender was entertaining and helpful.  There Is no sign on the outside so this place Is easy to miss!"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE

Walking in to the restaurant, it felt like I was transported to Paris. Yes, I can say this. I've been. The checkered floors and bar really brought me back. Not that I was by any means drinking as a 15 year old in France. Although I probably could have. The menu reflected adherence to classic French cuisine.

FOOD

I had the Saut√©ed Duck Confit Salad || Duck sits atop spinach, radishes, croutons and green bean. I loved the different take on duck confit and the fact that it was such a light meal. 

OVERALL

All in all, I was so full from breakfast and lunch meals. I wish I had had the room for dessert. I will certainly come back to try some! The atmosphere and food really made for a great meal."}
{"text":"By far the best service during my visit in Montreal. The food was also very good 

To start we had the mushroom truffle dish which basically has the same sauce as the mushroom ravioli, so pick one or the other. otherwise, it gets old pretty quick :/

we also had the duck salad thing which was quite tasty. would have preferred slightly more greens, but there was plenty of meat which was well seasoned.

we also had the vegetable garden soup which was just ok. probably wouldnt order again

the bread kept coming and the service was a solid 5*

would definitely come back to try other dishes. ie the risotto, which looked quite yum"}
{"text":"We came here based on the great yelp reviews. It was a bit disappointing since we were expecting much better based on all the positive reviews. We ordered a mushroom tart, steak/fries, and ravioli. Everything was cooked properly, but the taste was just average. The only thing I would recommend is steak, and fries."}
{"text":"tourist stay away from this place: over price, average food, service mediocre, over rated. don\"t let the over rating fool you. horrible place."}
{"text":"Incredible authentic French in Montreal. No trip to the North American Canadian City is complete without a true French meal. 

The ambiance is a classic no frills steakhouse - clean white table cloths and pictures of the restaurant team over the years on the wall. The meal begins with an incredible fresh baguette and the cutest tiniest pickles I've ever seen. I got the steak frites and my friends also got the beef tartare and salmon. All were incredible, and the pepper crusting on the steak was to die for. 

We also had a refreshing rose, and finished off with delicious cappuccinos. Great meal and would definitely recommend for anyone looking for French flavors!"}
{"text":"Everything food is simply perfect - from the tartar to the bone marrow to the fish to the pasta - and the quality of wine for the price is insane value. Every bottle on the menu, including those that cost $25-35 is first class for what it is. Service is on point. Pound for pound one of MTL's best."}
{"text":"We came from California did not make reservation.
The hostess was very nice gave us the table.
Food and services were excellent. We could not try the Floating Island or Creme Br√ªl√©e because they both sold out. Will definitive come back soon."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've been to and probably the best of the many upscale restaurants we tried in Montreal. 

Duck confit - excellent.

Pickles - outstanding.

Mustard - great.

Steak tartare - good but not the best I've had.

Service - good.

I would come back here in a heartbeat if I make it back to Montreal."}
{"text":"Classic French cuisine. Welcoming atmosphere. Casual and unpretentious. Broad selection of wine by the glass. Extremely knowledgeable bar men who can steer you towards optimal wine/food pairings and will respect if you are on a budget. Absolutely a worthwhile spot if you like French food and wine in a traditional but still lively ambiance."}
{"text":"Montrealers are spoiled in the sense that good food can be reasonable. Here is a place that is so good that the folks in the resto industry eat at. Tiles on the floor and a just a great atmosphere. The Dore Almondine is excellent. Just a fantastic brasserie."}
{"text":"Excellent! Food was amazing .. Staff attentive.  I had the Halibut special with fiddleheads and my husband the veal with morels ... Finished up with the l'isle de caramel for dessert  everything was perfectly prepared! c'est manefic!"}
{"text":"From the US perspective I think there's a lot of hype surrounding L'express because it was written on a couple of short-lists of must-eats in MTL - probably most notably in NYT.  Pre publicity it seemed like a great place to know to eat, a wonderful bistro with all the trim - indulge in anything, enjoy a cigarette between courses and lose your concerns in a great meal.  Indulge in everything but self consciousness.
The food is very good - reliable and delicious over years. 
Authenticity may wane with acclaim here..."}

{"text":"L'express is the quintessential perfect French bistro in Montreal.

We had reservations for 6:30pm on a Saturday, but were easily able to switch it to a 9:30pm ressie. When we arrived, the place was bustling and there were a good number of people waiting to be seated. Our table took a little while to be ready for us, but we only waited 10 mins max.

Along the walls are a ton of photos dating back to the 1970s, when L'express began. If a business has made it this far, it's good in my book. 

We ordered 2 half bottles of 2007 Bordeaux ($16 each), and started off with Bone Marrow and Foie Gras apps. We then ordered the duck confit salad, hanger steak frites, sea bass, and quail for our mains. 

The foie gras was nommalicious - I am a foie gras FIEND. MORE MORE MORE! It also came with a bucket of pickles that my friend could not stop eating (Hi Anita! :P) The bone marrow was pretty good too, but I have had better in NYC. The hanger steak was on par with normal steak frites. The duck confit was de-skinned and de-boned, which was disappointing because I was looking forward to that crunchy duck skin - but the meat was extremely flavorful. The sea bass was melt in yo'mouth. And this leaves the quail... OMG the QUAIL! So freaking good. Please do yourself a favor and get it. Amazeballs.

Such a huge fan of L'express! Perfect service, great food."}
{"text":"L'Express is one of the iconic French restaurants in Montreal dating back to the 80's. The restaurant's interior is classy, and for the short period of time that you're there the clock gets turned back. My friends and I ordered several things to share:

Celery remoulade: thin strips of celery root tossed in a housemade remoulade sauce topped with chives. This was quite large in portion, and the remoulade sauce was very strong. A bit too tart for my taste, but served as a nice appetizer.

Roasted quail with wild rice: this was delicious. The quail was perfectly roasted with a slightly crispy exterior. The meat was moist and very flavorful, and the wild rice and quail eggs both served as nice sides.

Epaule de porcelet croustillante: roughly, this is crispy pork loin in a creamy mustard sauce. But it's not just any pork: porcelet is a pig suckling that is fed with milk, and is truly the \"cream of the crop\" when it comes to pork. Unfortunately I am not a pork eater, but my friend did say that this was some of the best pork that he has ever had.

Ttoro basque: a Basque style fish stew cooked with pieces of sea bass, shrimp, mussels, fennel, and potatoes in a rich fish broth. This was perhaps one of the best fish stews that I have ever had. The fish broth was strong but not overpowering, and had a nice sweetness in the taste. All of the seafood weren't overcooked, and the roasted fennel really compliment the entire stew very nicely. Literally wiped the entire bowl clean (I had to ask for extra bread!).

Orange creme caramel: for dessert, we shared this, which is essentially a flan topped with candied orange peel in a caramel sauce. Simple, but elegantly presented. The orange peels were delicious and not even slightly bitter, and complimented the slightly sweet flan and caramel sauce well. A delicious ending.

Service was very good, and our server was patient explaining to us virtually everything on the menu as we indecisively made our orders. Kudos to them!

This stands as one of the most memorable meals that I have had in quite some time. A real bummer that I can't be coming here everyday!"}
{"text":"A Montr√©al institution with true Parisien flair, value, professional staff, impeccable wine list, a \"must\" in this city.
Although open for lunch and dinner (going into the wee hours) I enjoy breakfast at this resto"}
{"text":"Where am I?  Am I in Strausberg?
And did that Garson really just slap himself for spilling wine?

Will frequent...from Boston."}
{"text":"Everything about our meal here was pretty spot on. The food was amazing, and the price at the end was extremely reasonable. 

Standouts for me
chicken liver with pistachio - I'm not normally a big fan of pate, but this was addicting. I couldn't stop eating it I loved it.
octopus/lentil salad - octopus was cooked perfectly, salad was presented beautifully.
beef tartare - wouldn't normally think of getting tartare as an entree but I wanted so much of this that it makes sense. amazing

the rest of the dishes were also great - bone marrow, steak frites, roasted quail, seabass, pork and mushroom raviolis

we also ordered a couple desserts, which everyone said were amazing - I was stuffed from the meal that I couldn't fit another bite"}
{"text":"First, it's on St. Denis street, who clearly was the BEST of all the Saints.  So they get 5 stars for location. 

Came here for an early dinner, around 6:30.  No problem getting in.   By 7:30 it was packed, so make sure to make reservations! 

The service was more efficient than polite.  Nothing to make you feel unwanted, but nothing to give you that friendly feeling either.  However, it was very quick and prompt.  It could have been because our table was reserved for 8:15 (which they told us twice) and they wanted to get rid of us quick, but the service was very fast.  Which is a huge plus. 

The complimentary bread was absolutely delicious.  Not warm, but super fresh.  I got the steak and fries, which I now realize is my usual order at a french place.  The steak was pretty good, the fries were golden and crispy, really good.  For dessert I got a lemon tart (though it was called something else in french).  Not the regular watered down taste, super lemony, so I was a huge fan! 

The ambiance is nothing special, especially for the price.  Everything is plain, nothing is particularly clean, though it's not dirty either.  The tables have white papers on them...  At first glance it could be a deli with a bar."}
{"text":"**3.5**

After much hype about this restaurant I made a reservation for Friday night. It was the first restaurant we went to on our weekend trip to Montreal. The restaurant by itself has a nice vibe to it, its a lively setting. We were seated immediately and started to place or orders. We had the bone marrow and foie gras for starters. I have to agree with one other reviewer when I say the quantity of the bone marrow was a lot, there were four of us at the table and we still had a tough time finishing it. Its a very rich dish and having too much of it killed the joy for me. It was my first time trying foie gras and I have to admit I did not like it, hence I can't really comment upon it. I had read about different styles in which it could be made and maybe I would have liked that more versus it being served just as is...

Moving on the the main course, Mr. H had the chicken and said it was good, another friend had the risotto and loved it, one friend had the steak frites and had more to say regarding the frites vs. the steak. I had the quail and it was absolutely amazing! I dropped my fork and nibbled on it with my hands, out went the etiquette!

For dessert we had the chocolate tart and it was fine. Overall the experience was a lot of ups and downs, for the price we paid it should have been awesome. I left a little disappointed and maybe next time I'll try another place.

- The quail and the risotto were the highlights!"}
{"text":"I'll start the review by saying I enjoyed the food and the star review doesn't reflect that. 

But... There were live ants in one of our bread trays! We didn't make a fuss, because I think we all weren't the type, but we did call the waiter over and pointed it out and asked him to remove that tray of bread. We also stayed and ordered partly because we were in shock, and partly because we don't like fusses and it would be strange to walk out of the restaurant. And partly because we were hungry (it's hard to make rational decisions when hungry and near food) and figured it was probably a one time deal (it was. We checked all the rest of the bread bowls and no ants). 

The waiter took away the bread bowl quickly... And the situation wasn't brought up again. We got our food. It was pretty tasty. It wasn't the best I've ever had but probably a solid 4 stars at least if I didn't have ants on the brain. The service was slow between dinner and dessert, but I think that's because it was peak dinner time (~7:30pm). The waitstaff was quite polite. We had two main servers, and one was extremely nice and attentive with the water. 

The white chocolate and pistachio creme brulee was delicious btw. Credit where credit is due. 

And we paid and left... And now I'm writing this because I think we should have received more... something for the presence of live insects in our food. There was perhaps a quick apology as it was whisked away, but that was it. Did the waiter even let the manager know? I would have appreciated the manager coming over and apologizing. I would have really appreciated having our wine or dessert comped. I am frustrated that, since I'm not someone who likes to kick up a fuss, the situation was poorly handled. I guess I learned my lesson."}
{"text":"This place is fascinating, see more about the dynamic below.  But first, the food!

We started with the grilled octopus and lentil salad, which was absolutely delicious!  We also enjoyed the baguette and jar of perfectly brined pickles (we noshed on these all night).  For mains, my friend really enjoyed her shrimp risotto.  I did not care for my steak frites, the meat was kind of gristly and hard to cut.  The frites are actually fries, but still tasty, although the aioli was basically just plain mayonnaise.  The wine list is extensive, but our server helped us pick out a bottle of pinot noir that I liked more than I expected.  Dessert was the caramelized meringue.  It sounded like I might not like it, but it's tasty.  A cake of stiff meringue with a glaze of caramelized sugar around it and some custard on the bottom, it was tasty.

Service was touch and go.  The host did not appreciate that we did not have a reservation at 9pm on a Sunday.  He tried to seat us at the bar, but we requested one of the several open tables.  Our server seemed amused by the fact that we didn't know what we wanted after 3 minutes.  He warmed up, though, and explained some of the popular dishes.  The busser was actually the most friendly staff we encountered, he was super sweet and made us feel very welcome.  

After our appetizer, they apologetically asked if we could move to make room for some late arrivals to the strangest dinner party ever.  Our server gave us a complimentary glass of wine with dessert, which was really nice.  During our leisurely dinner, we watched table after table of the strangest clientele arrive.  A group of college students came in in sweats and hats, which they did not remove, nor were they asked to.  Next came a very glamorous couple.  They were seated for 20 minutes when another group came in who they seemed to know, but just bumped into, so they moved.  A young couple in pajamas were seated when a couple they knew came by, so they moved to a bigger table as well.  At midnight, yet another couple walked in and were seated for dinner.  This is a Sunday!  Needless to say, if you need some good people watching, come to L'Express."}
{"text":"Un excellent Bistro fran√ßais, service impeccable et carte des vins impressionnante"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast and left happy and satisfied!

The brunch/breakfast menu is small and only in French, but our waitress spoke English and she was very willing to help us.  A man who I assume was the manager was also chatty and very kind.

I ordered the french toast, which I loved.  It was made with very thick brioche bread, which was soaked just right and not dry or soggy.  My son had two scrambled eggs, which was made much more \"wet\" than we are accustomed to in the states - I assumed it was loaded with cream.   Well, he loved it and actually asked for more, but I gave him some of my french toast instead (which he also loved).  My husband's fried eggs and bacon looked good - the bacon was not as fatty as we are used to but looked good because of that.  His dish was also served with sliced and toasted French bread - which was SOOO good with a bit of butter on it.  Our coffee tasted great, and I will only complain that it was luke warm rather than hot (but our refills were hot).

Overall we were served a simple breakfast, but it was so delicious.  It reminded me of the simple yet delicious meals we had in Paris years ago!"}
{"text":"Came in this morning with a party of 5. I called to make a reservation and was told the restaurant doesn't take reservations. When I came in at 11 am today, I was told by the older gentleman at the door that we absolutely needed a reservation. He then turned around and dismissed us when half the restaurant was empty. Thanks for the great service. We ended up at l'evidence a few doors down and they were very warm and welcoming."}

{"text":"Enjoy the old time decor. They start you off with a mason jar of teeny pickles (yummy) and bread. We had a green salad to start and it was basic and delicious. Small but enough to share. We ordered croque Monsieur and steak frites, both very good. Nice ambiance, slow service and good food. Be careful not to miss it when you walk down the street. No signage other than the floor."}

{"text":"I'm utterly shocked I haven't reviewed this place yet, especially since it's one of my favorite eateries in North America (that's right, I get to say that because this is an international review here).  

***Look carefully for this place, there's no sign out front***

I apologize I can't remember the French names for all the dishes, but if you grab the English menu, refer to my recommendations below.

Best Dish:  Veal Kidneys in Mustard Sauce (not mustard!!!)

Most Overrated Dish:  Bone marrow...with salt!  Ooooo, fancy.

Dish most likely to give you diabetes:  A giant glazed puff of meringue.  It might be worth it though.

Best Dessert: Baba Rhum.  As an added bonus, this dish might get you drunk.

Another feature of this place is it's lack of pretentiousness.  It's almost like a 40's diner.  So sit back, have gurcken (they bring a jar full of gurckens to the table by the way), and enjoy."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. We had to wait 45 minutes passed when we had reservations to be seated.Regulars who arrived after us were seated ahead of us. The staff were cold and unwelcoming and told us they were
very busy.
 When we finally got seated things went from bad to worse.
The escargot was served on bed of mash potatoes and  mushed peas had and had   no flavour  the sorrel soup was more like diluted pea soup very weak, the salmon was over done served on bland spinach. We asked numerous times for their famous pickle jar and finally got up and got it ourselves, which was less than 10 feet away
 The staff was very unfriendly and food mediocre  at best .We had been here before and it was much better the other times  .Maybe they just  had a bad night but we won't be back soon.We are regular attendees of the great Montreal Jazz festival and love coming to Montreal
There are many superior places in Montreal that have great food and  service that are better than this place.This is definetely  not a 5 star bistro!"}
{"text":"This was our first meal on a recent trip to Montreal with a friend. We stopped by for a late lunch (around 2pm) -- it was still pretty crowded, given the time. I ordered the country style soup and roasted beet salad, which were very complementary. The beets were cooked just right and had good flavor. The pickles and mustard were also a nice starter at the beginning of the meal (they provide you with a huge jar of pickles for the table). The decor of this place is super cute and European -- I recommend it!

-L."}
{"text":"A staple in Montreal restaurant scene. If you are craving a nice bistro meal & environment, then L'Express is the place to go to. Just be warned it is LOUD and bustling. 

I've eaten several meals here and never been disappointed. I especially like the warm goat cheese salad, foie gras, homemade ravioli and steak frites. The desserts are great too. Highly recommend this classic bistro."}
{"text":"An authentic french place in the heart of the plateau.  My friends decided to get engaged here, in front of us! I lost track of everything after that. I remember something about pickles in a jar brought to the table. Something about some really great wine. And I've heard good things about the steak frites.  Not super easy for vegetarians to find things to eat. (See aforementioned bone marrow review!) 
Lovely setting, though. Service is impeccable."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My friends and I ordered the avocado escargot and cold soup as starters, and the escargot was amazzzzzzzzzzing. We ordered the veal dish and duck salad for mains, and the duck was incredible! Wine was recommended by server and it was...OBVIOUSLY FANTASTIQUE.

Rec rec rec! Go!"}
{"text":"We had our final lunch here and it was like stepping into a Paris Bistro.  I saw that they had the Croque Monsieur (had not seen that on any menu) so I just had to have it.  Also had the fish soup.  Everything was so yummy including the bottle of bubbly we had to wash it all down.  Need to come back for dinner!"}
{"text":"An almost discreet looking restaurant from the outside, but once you walk in it feels as if you are in a French bistro in Paris. The atmosphere is lively, quaint, and refined with tie wearing wait staff taking orders and delivering plates.
On a late (10:15pm) Sunday night, it was quite busy, but perhaps it was our luck that the service, though professional, was a bit slow from the time we sat down to settling the bill.
As for the food, it did not disappoint. This being our third visit, the food has always been excellent, and we were happy with our dishes. The poached salmon, hanger steak, and quail. The beet salad to start was excellent.
I would give 5 stars, but the slow service on this particular occasion drops it down to 4."}
{"text":"L'express is amazing. 

The quiche jambon fromage was fantastic - very moist and tasty. The raviolis maison was absolutely incredible - it was very flavorful and though it was not a large dish, it took me time to get through. 

The pudding aux pommes et poires was also very well done - light and fluffy but also rich and satisfying. 

The atmosphere is great - very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. We dressed up in some nice duds and hit the town for a romantic dinner. We started off with the bone marrow appetizer. Oh, Lordy Lordy! It was GOOD! I wish we each ordered our own. It came with four large pieces of bone and slices of toasted baguette. Next, we each had a simple salad and a splendid Burgundy. I ordered grilled halibut and the hubby had a chicken and beef stew that came with a large piece of marrow in bone. I was a little jealous. For dessert, a pretty little chocolate tart that melted in my mouth with a strong dose of espresso. 

The service was very decent and attentive without being fussy. It's a bustling atmosphere, loud and lively. I love having dinner in places like this. It's got that non-contrived look about it other restaurants try to create. It feels authentic. Next time I'm in Montreal, I will definitely make a point of eating here again."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best meal I had in Montreal!

First off, since I am from the states, I'm thankful reservations can be made via OpenTable.

DECOR:
Atmosphere is very French Bistro like - simple and clean.

FOOD:
Appetizers:
Bone Marrow - you get three portions. a little much for two people, but great to share for the table.  whatever toasted bread that came with it was equally as delicious as the bone marrow itself.

Scallops - it was the special of the night.  pretty good, except we did not eat it as soon as it was served so it got a bit cold.  eat this right away!

Entrees:
Shrimp Risotto - so creamy and flavorful, loved it.  also generous with their shrimp portions
Duck Confit Salad - a perfect melody that blended so well together - soft and crunchy greens, tender and crispy duck...it was great!

Dessert:
√Æle flottante - meringue coated with hardened sugar - this was a bit too sweet for us.


SERVICE:
Our waiter was wonderful.  Very attentive.  Gave us good wine recommendations. Food came out fast."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come to L'Express for years and I finally got to make my dreams come true last night when my boyfriend took me here for a romantic tete-a-tete. 

From the get go, we were greeted by the host, a very kind gentleman who happily lead us to our table. Right away, my boo and I ordered glasses of beers while we enjoyed some bread and gherkins and waited to place our orders. 
We ordered our wine (Le St. Chinian), entr√©es -- both got onglets done medium rare. The cuts were small according to my partner (he's a big boy = big appetite) but I thought it was perfection. The fries were divine as well, while my boy got mashed potatoes (he has a peanut allergy and they do deep fry their fries in peanut oil) which he thoroughly enjoyed. 

Everything was beyond delicious but my favourite part was definitely dessert. We got the cheese cake and I honestly believe that it is the best cheese cake I have ever eaten in my life. That and my cappuccino and we had ourselves a perfect evening over a delicious, unforgetful meal. 

The service was prompt and very friendly, yet remained very professional. I honestly have no complaints about L'Express. The only one thing I have to say is why is it so good? I have to go back sooner than later now! haha! Prices were also reasonable for being a bit on the more expensive side for us but sometimes we just gotta treat ourselves to a really fantastic wine, dinner and company."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this place as well as the amazing food!

Among my favourite dishes here are the warm duck confit salade and the buttery yummy bone marrow that you scoop out and season with salt....mmmmmmm.

I wish there was a sweet little place like this in California!  My best advice is to make reservations!!"}
{"text":"Warning: Should be called \"L'Escargot\" -- very slow service. 

We went for a quick bite -- taking the name somewhat seriously -- and sat at the bar counter to speed things further.  Unfortunately, is was about 45 minutes before our sandwiches (Croque Monsieur) arrived.  I had to scarf it down in order to get to my meeting.  My wife stayed to finish at a more leisurely pace, and the resto did comp us two glasses of wine...but buyer beware, they didn't live up to the name.  

Food-wise, I would give it 4 stars for what it is -- straight-ahead bistro fare."}
{"text":"A revisit to Montreal would not be complete without a stop for dinner at L'express. 

Same Parisian decor. Same excellent service. Great wine selection. Intimate atmosphere. 

Quick recap of what we ate:
***Goat cheese and chestnut salad (lots of flavors that married well, really good portion size) 
***Quail and wild rice (surprisingly great, star of the show, rice well cooked, 5 pieces of tender quail) 
***Steak frites (loved it, we'll cooked, wish the fries were more stringy) 
***apple tart (husband was a big fan) 

On the list for the best places in Montreal."}
{"text":"high quality ingredients, served with simple finesse. 

i came twice during my short trip to Montreal, so it was that delicious and satisfying.
both times i sat at the old school mirrored bar, where the servers were helpful and genuine. order from the seasonal menu, you can see the chefs' creativity and excitement to use seasonal produce in the thoughtful food.

-Nova Scotia oysters
-baby artichoke hearts, button mushrooms, fresh herbs- delicate, yet satisfying
-crispy duck confit with new potatoes, ground cherries, mushrooms, demi glace and frisee- wow, what a perfect dish. the kitchen is generous with wild mushrooms, and i loved seeing the short season ground cherries on the plate. demi glace is deeply flavored, seasoned perfectly.
-il flotante- so fun! but the portion was huge for one person. need to work on my French bistro lunch capacity.

second visit:
-squash soup with goat cheese and almonds- creamy, refreshing, highlighted the perfectly ripe and sweet summer squash
-beet salad- gorgeous mix of flavors, textures and temperatures. in such a simple guise. slivers of buttered mushrooms tucked under a crown of perfect baby red lettuce leaves, hunks of tender sunset colored beets as the foundation.
-fresh summer berries with buffalo milk yogurt and vanilla honey syrup- exactly what i wanted after seeing so many berries at the farmers' market. a generous bowl of summer, topped with micro basil, a lovely complement."}
{"text":"I loved it. The service was great,  food was spectacular! Everything we ordered was very good, but the octopus+lentils starter was one of the best dishes I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"We wanted one last bite of French cuisine before we left Montreal and hit this place up mid-afternoon on a Sunday. Perfect timing as we were sat right away. It's a beautiful, charming restaurant, especially on a sunny day. Started off with mimosas and then chicken liver pate, the bone marrow salad, and shredded duck confit salad. And red wine - excellent recs from our server. Everything was decadent and delicious. Not a bad plate among all three. My boyfriend looked like he'd died and gone to heaven when they put a huge jar of cornichons in front of him and said we get unlimited bread. I bet they were sorry they told him that after he ate like 3 baskets.

We also had dessert. I highly recommend the orange caramel pudding.

If you want old school French, this is a great bet."}
{"text":"Good late night food but it doesn't get mor than 4 star, don't order the fish soup, do order the bone marrow"}
{"text":"Terrific service on a recent visit, sitting at the bar. 

Atmosphere: A
Service: A
Wine selection: A
Food: B. 

The goat cheese and chestnut said was decent. The braised lamb special was poorly done, with a sauce that seemed to have been made by someone who does not know how to cook. At these prices, a better chef might be in order!"}
{"text":"I just don't get this place. The concierge in our hotel advised against L'Express, however we went anyway after looking over all the glowing reviews. 

It wasn't terribly busy as we had a late reservation (10pm). As New Yorkers, we get great French cuisine anytime and were dying to try it out in Montreal. This place had the ambiance of a maroon color painted truck stop diner. We had the warm goat cheese salad (ok), steak frites (good), the lobster risotto (good) and orange panna cotta type of desert (bad). The portions are much smaller than what we Americans are accustomed to. Our bill was approx 120 CAD with a 1/2 bottle of wine, not including tip. Service was friendly, although painfully slow (how typical of the french!). We even had a \"French Canadian local\" tell us to stay away from French food in Montreal; he was right. 

So to sum it up it was just average, not worth the price and really nothing to write home about. New York does French way better. Please see: Balthazar, Les Halles, Pastis, Le Gamin... the list goes on...."}
{"text":"I ended up here the day before Canada Day. My friend and I were looking for a place to eat at 11p after having a couple of drinks at the bar. Everything around the hotel seemed to be close but someone recommended Le Express because they served food until 2a. The place looks like a diner mixed with a white table cloth restaurant. The servers were nice, fast and polite. I ordered some bread to tame my hunger and to my disappointment it was incredible hard and chewy. It was served with cornichons and Dijon mustard which I found incredibly delicious! I decided to order one of the specials which was spaghetti and mushrooms. I have to say for a pasta without a lot of sauce but to have so much flavor, even without cheese, I was amazed! My friend ordered the croque messieur which was amazing but the French fries were atrocious. So, I guess it all depends on what you order and what time you arrive. I would definitely go back in a time of need."}
{"text":"This classic French bistro in a bustling, hip Montreal neighborhood is a lot of fun, good for groups and families.  It's a long, narrow space with tile floors and small tables placed close together--which makes the dining environment as authentically Parisian as the food.  I wouldn't come here for quiet conversation, but my husband and I enjoyed the energetic, sociable vibe.  Waitstaff were knowledgeable, friendly and efficient. Excellent cornichons and mustard on each table were nice touches.

L'Express has an extensive menu with most of the greatest hits of bistro fare (pot au feu, steak frites, pate, duck confit, etc., etc.).  Starters vary widely in cost, from roughly $5 to $25, something to keep in mind if you're on a budget, because what you choose for that course, if anything, will determine whether you have an expensive meal or a moderately priced one.  Mains are mostly in the $20-26 range.  That said, some of the starters (quiche and salad, lobster risotto) are substantial enough to be a perfect main course, and others, like the chicken liver mousse, would be good to share. They offer a moderate, mostly French wine list with a good selection of wines by the glass.

My husband ordered a warm goat cheese salad and the hanger steak with fries, and I had a special cold soup, a kind of vichyssoise with artichokes, and then a warm duck confit salad.  Both starters were on the bland side--maybe 3 stars--but the main courses were fantastic, solidly five-star, deliciously and precisely prepared.  My husband's hanger steak was the best we'd tasted in years; it did not need the accompanying (and delicious, in a lily-gilding way) herb butter.  Fries were classic French frites, down to the garlic aioli that came with them.  My duck salad was amazing, full of crisp-edged pieces of sauteed duck confit over a spinach, radish and endive base that was dressed with what I strongly suspect was duck fat.  Super-rich!  After all this goodness neither of us could imagine dessert, which was a shame, because the dessert list looked great.  My advice? Skip the starters, or share one with someone else, then have a main course and dessert."}
{"text":"For my ex-pat Thanksgiving dinner, I went to L'express. The very kind waitstaff snuck us into bar seats though the restaurant was clearly booked for the night. As a bread whore I was delighted with the fresh baguettes and butter and even more pleased with my entre. I had the steak frites, which were absolutely DELICIOUS. L'express made me mourn not being in France that night, not the US!"}
{"text":"Our experience at L'Express was enjoyable. We really enjoyed the goat cheese salad, the steak frites and the chicken breast entrees but the other two things we ordered, the fish soup and the sea bass were lackluster. The fish soup, made with monk fish, was quite fishy tasting although we were assured by our server that it was not. The sea bass was a little dry and wasn't anything special. We enjoyed a bottle of Beaujolais and would recommend L'express for the pleasant french bistro vibe, but there are things on the menu that are better than others."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Very lively, very busy, simple/classic French bistro decor, good lighting

Food: We had the Soupe au Poisson (Fish soup), Os a Moelle (Bone marrow), Steak tartare w/ Frites, and the Quail dish. The fish soup was savory and not overwhelmingly fishing (hit the spot on a cold night!) and the bone marrow was nothing short of exquisite. The tartare was very nicely spiced and you sure do get a very healthy portion of it. The quail was very flavorful, but slightly on the drier side.

Drink: One pinot grigio and one cabernet sauvignon recommended by the waiter. For about $9-$10 a glass, this was fantastic!

Staff: Can be quite French, but still very helpful. The busboy was much more helpful and always checked in on us.

Summary: Get a reservation! Delicious food (get the bone marrow!) at reasonable prices. Great wine list."}
{"text":"Had a nice meal at L'express. The place is apparently reminiscent of a restaurant in Paris with its decor. The wait staff was nice and helpful. What we initially noticed was the wine list. Having a few options for under $30 which is almost unheard of. We started with a warm goat cheese salad which was a nice start. I wouldn't say it was the best salad I've ever had BUT it was a nice french start. The pickles and bread they put on the table are a delicious touch. 

For mains we ordered a croque monsieur and the bavette. They came with a healthy portion of fries. We both enjoyed these mains. The croque monsieur was as buttery as you'd expect from a french restaurant. The steak was good with a compound butter. 

For dessert, we decided to get a creme caramel. It was quite delicious. The french version of a flan is quite nice and light. 

Overall, it was a nice meal, wouldn't say it was exceptional but its worth checking out. Not the cheapest meal, however, and this is why I rate this a 3."}
{"text":"From south of the customs and a French cuisine virgin, so I can't say I was used to the experience. 

Service was slow as first, but did pick up. My understanding is that each table had a waiter and server. The way dinner worked was that you got your menu, ordered appetizers, ate, table cleared, got the menu, ordered main course and so on, and repeat again for dessert. This led to a long wait time that no one in our party was used to/prepared for. (Not to mention the name of the restaurant led us to think this would be a fast meal.) I struggled to not use my phone... I assume that's what \"No SVP\" meant with the image below it on the corner of the menu.

Onto the food:

For appetizer, we had the smoked salmon, bone marrow with coarse salt, sorrel soup, and the \"country style\" soup. The country style soup was a vegetable soup.

The soups tasted great. The veggie soup was loaded and tasted of the vegetables. The sorrel soup was thick, rich -and sour! Wonderful! The smoked salmon was good, lightly smoked. The bone marrow was mediocre, however. Rich, but flavourless. Turns out we were suppose to apply the salt at our own discretion. A little salt goes a long way for bone marrow, but given how small a piece of bone marrow is, applying salt ourselves meant it was easily over salted.

For main course, we had the calf liver and the hangar steak. The liver came with your choice of side, which was spinach for us. It was well cooked, not tough and dry as I'd feared from childhood horrors of eating livers. The steak was topped with shallot butter and came with well-fried(over fried? Double fried? It was darker than usual after spending extra time in the oil.) fries. The steak was good but not great, chewier than what I'd expected and could be over seasoned for some. The fries were good but the dipping sauce wasn't to my liking. I was later told that steak isn't really a French thing. I wish I was told earlier. I was hoping to try bouillabaisse but that was not on the menu.

So what does being from the States have to do with any of this? Would the same not apply to someone from Ontario or BC?

Well, not knowing local initials, when the bill came, below the subtotal were lines for T.P.S. and T.V.Q.(I very likely don't have the initials right either) which our party had thought meant the tips were included. You know, tips and tax both started with a T. With that idea, we didn't leave much behind, but it was more than a quarter (Yeap, I know about the quarter)

Turns out the two lines were for two taxes - federal and provincial. Nope, this is not done in California or Vermont or anywhere else in the US- or anywhere in general for that matter- that we've been to. So, yeah, the waiter and server from Thursday night, sorry.

Someone get back to me if I've got something wrong."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. We had the hangar steak and it was the best we've ever had!  The rice pudding came highly recommended and was to die for. Everything we ate was delicious, and the impeccable service made our experience pretty close to perfect. Will definitely be eating here each trip back to Montreal!"}
{"text":"When I go to Montreal, I always go here at least once.  

The place is charming, always packed, and a scene.  Waiters, waitresses buzzying about.  Conversations mostly in French, Quebec. Feels like Paris, I love it.  

Food served is classic bonne femme cookery, with obvious Quebecois influences around the edges.  I adore their French-only menus, esp., their wine list stuffed with so many affordable French bottles = pure heaven.  If you haven't been to Montreal, dining here is an absolute must.

You might have to wait for a table, but, it is worth it."}
{"text":"We stepped into L'Express for a late lunch on a recommendation from a friend and WOW are we glad we did! The restaurant is beautiful, the service is excellent, and the food is amazing. I enjoyed the croque monsieur with a glass of ros√© our server recommended- delicious! My boyfriend ordered the steak frites which were also amazing. 

Highly recommend L'Express if you're looking for delicious French fare in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Bon restaurant, tr√®s classique. C'est du bistro fran√ßais tel qu'on se l'imagine (on y sert m√™me du c√©leri remoulade...). Le service est pas mal, mais l'√©tablissement aurait besoin d'un petit coup de neuf.

Les prix sont raisonnables, surtout compte-tenu de l'emplacement."}
{"text":"It's like walking into the first class dining car on a train from the 1920's. The bartenders are always tidy and stressed in could-kill-you-with-graciousness kind of way. It is very French which can take some time when it comes to ordering. Not to mention the specials are hand-written on the left margin of the menu. An English menu is available for rejects like me who are still remembering what shark is in French. 
Again, my love of the counter has a home. A long, long bar set for full dining. You'll see everything from Sex In the City like groups of girls who could care less if men were ogling them because they're so involved in some good dish to what look like unshaven musicians to professor like men huddled around a table as if they've been going there for years. 

The food is fresh, timely and presented beautifully. I saw the squid come out and I thought it was a bouquet of flowers. Next time, I'm definitely trying it. 
It can be a little pricey but when every other good restaurant is closing, L'express is just picking up. 
Grab someone by the hand and huddle in the foyer until you are lead to the perfect seat. Every table seems to have a good story, including yours."}
{"text":"The ambience was really cozy, friendly and just like at home.

We had a table on very back side and there were so many pictures that they are still taking every year since they've opened the restaurant. These pictures amused us very much.

Yes, food was great. The waiters and matre D. were very nice. I think we will go back again when we visit Montreal next time. It just because for, smoked salmon and  leak gratin, both we ordered for appetizers. these were amazing.
Also they brought us olive oil for the smoked salmon and it was best olive oil that we've ever had!!! Seriously. Tried on smoked salmon and also on bread, yum:) We really wanted to get it, so asked where they getting it from. The lady told us we can get same Olive oil from Milan super market that located near of Jean-Talon market, but it was the last night of Montreal for us(left early in the morning) I may look up on line.

P.s. I couldn't find the olive oil so I have to go back to Montreal sometime very soon!!! n of course, we will stop by L'express:)"}

{"text":"If you want video and imagery of my amazing experience here, go here: http://bit.ly/1DPPgA

The night is still young, the sun is still shining, and I'm in high spirits as I enter L'Express, a cute little restaurant in Montreal.

I grab the last seat at the bar, and gaze upon an impressive menu and wine list.  I decide to go with the chicken liver pate with pistachios, the rillettes, and the bone marrow I've heard so much about.

Presented before my meal is basic bread and butter, mustard, and little pickles to tickle my tongue.

The chicken liver pate with pistachios is served to me first.   It is soft, spreadable like a cool and creamy butter.  Perfect spread on a piece of baguette that is soft, yet firm and balanced.

Next, the rillettes are served.  The spread is robust with texture from the chunks of pulled canard.  Atop lies a slice of yellow plum and a generous sprinkle of chives.  Scattered around the pot is toasted baguette.  

Is it white pepper I taste in the rillettes?  Delicious, spiced perfectly (not overwhelming, but enough to leave a wonderful flavor lingering on your tongue.)

The bone marrow is next, served in 4 pieces in the bone and each covered by a round of green.  Grey salt is served in the middle and toasted baguette again.  I coax the marrow out with my knife, and pour it onto the toast.  The fat juices drip down the side of the bone and laugh with delight.  My first bite.  The salt is PERFECT with this!  It only enhances the wondrous flavor of marrow.  My first experience with marrow served as such, and a glorious experience it is.

The floating island is my dessert.  A large dome of meringue long with a caramel glaze on top floating in a creme anglaise.  The meringue is soft and sweet, and the hard caramelized outside becomes malleable in my mouth.  To offset the sweetness, a spoonful of creme from the dish is perfect, for it is not too sweet, nor does it overwhelm the palate.  What a way to finish an amazing food adventure at L'Express.

Yummers!  See you on twitter... @tastytwosome. :)"}
{"text":"High expectations for this restaurant as it was highly ranked on a number of lists of top restaurants (both in Montreal and across Canada). The restaurant delivered on a number of fronts: desserts (maple profiteroles, apple tart, ice cream), salad (featuring cheese of the moment: burrrata) and the ambience (classic Montreal kinda Parisian, as promised). Only place we were slightly underwhelmed was the main courses: steak frites (hanger steak was tasty but a bit tougher than I like) and their lemon chicken was just ok. The wine suggested was perfect. Overall, we would return to further explore the menu."}
{"text":"We are here for a company conference walking down the Rue Saint Denis....and found this place for lunch.  The staff was great (very helpful with english) and the food was great!"}
{"text":"Someone on the train recommended this place. We stopped in around 8pm on a Friday and they were totally booked up but said they might have space at the bar in an hour. We went somewhere else for a drink and came back and were sat around 9:15.

We ordered a nice bottle of red wine and asked the waiter for some recommendations. He suggested the onglet and the chestnut salad as a starter. Both things I probably wouldn't have ordered.

I absolutely loved the chestnut salad. Fantastic! My friend was obsessed with the onglet.

I would love to come back and try a few other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Classic french bistro. The space and food is reminiscent of any bustling street side restaurant in Paris. 

Tried and Tested Good Food:
Hanger steak and fries
Ravioli
Shrimp risoto

The meh:
the signature dessert meringue thingy with caramel housing"}
{"text":"Where do I begin....the waiters and maitre D were stuck up as hell.
The resto is very nice but it was over hyped.
The Tartare was decent but not something I would go back for.
The Shrimp Risotto wasn't consistent and very bland. 

Overall I would not return."}
{"text":"I went here about a month ago and the food was perfect. Everyone at the table was very happy with their choices. However, for a french restaurant, the bread was incredibly underwhelming. The desserts were disappointing. 
If you're looking for good main dishes, though, this place is great!"}
{"text":"Fancy Fancy! If you don't have reservations on a weekend expect a bit of a wait! The food here is awesome. The menu has a variety of options and translated to English for those of us who don't speak French. I would've given them 5 stars but our initial impression kinda turned us off. The guy who took our name down was a little dismissive and not very welcoming. I saw he had the same attitude with other people as well. Perhaps he was overwhelmed but a bit more hospitality would've been appreciated. 

On to the food....I recommend the Shrimp Risotto, Goat Cheese salad and Steak Tartare! Everything was delicious and I was stuffed by the end of the meal. The wine was excellent. Affordable and classy spot. I'd revisit!"}
{"text":"Had a great time here with a great crowd, the ambiance is nothing short of amazing at L'Express. Your waiter or waitress will take great care of you and pay close attention to your table. Nothing beats solid service.

Paired with numerous bottles of fine wine, we enjoyed repeated orders of their duck confit and foie gras mousse. (Neither of which I was ever a fan of until having them here!)"}
{"text":"L'Express was recommended to us by a friend who used to live in Montreal as having amazing French food. We therefore made a reservation late one night (as they were completely booked until 8/8:30). 

At the entrance, we noticed an overflowing coat rack and checked in with the host. There is hardly any room to wait, but there were a few other groups waiting in the tiny space since no one wanted to wait outside in the cold. 

We waited. And waited. The host apologized, saying there was a mix up. About 20 minutes after we had arrived (on time for our reservation), the host asked us to sit at the bar and enjoy a complimentary glass of wine. I can't say no to free wine. 

The bartender was friendly and poured us glasses of our preferences. About 10 minutes later we were seated. We were given complimentary bread and a jar of pickles. I love pickles! Definitely a plus! I ordered the bone marrow and the ravioli. Both were delicious. I had a bite of my friend's risotto, which was also very delicious. 

The menu was in French and the waiter seemed to be more confident in French. It was definitely a nice dinner, and not too fancy to feel awkward or pretentious. The restaurant front is a bit unassuming and I heard people who were passing by say this was the best French restaurant in montreal. I thought it was great!"}
{"text":"The food is consistently good. It's not the best in town - but it's always good. The service is usually good as well, although they can be a bit gruff.

But let's admit it - you're here for the food, the wine, the company, yes - but really, you're here because this is a kick-ass honest-to-god French bistro. And it's just really authentic and consistently fun. 

And they're open late!"}
{"text":"After eating at many Montreal restaurants, this became my favorite.  The 'Maison du Ravioli' was spectacular, almost melting in the mouth.  The ravioli are filled with 3 kinds of meats and served in a veal/mushroom reduction.  The menu is the same for lunch and dinner.  

As in many Montreal restaurants, most dress nicely for dinner, but they will allow people with t-shirts in.  

If you are in Montreal, go here.  If you are not in Montreal, get yourself to Montreal and eat here."}
{"text":"L'Express is such a classic French restaurant. Food is consistent and service is very friendly with a cozy atmosphere. Ever since the first time I came to this place, I dreamt of coming back and enjoying that roasted quail dish. The bone marrow was also one of my favourite, but at this visit, I was overfilled with cholesterol from the night before so I decided against it. 

Fish soup was very light and on the watery side. It had a clean fish flavour in a slight tomato-y broth.

Green salad was perfectly dressed with a vinaigrette on fresh greens. I loved this salad. 

Roasted quail with wild rice is something everyone should try. Everything about this dish is just so perfect. The quail is so crisp on the outside with juicy meat on the inside. The sauce it's drizzled with is very flavourful and a little salty, but it added to the dish. The rice was perfectly cooked. I loved the chewy texture and it all came topped with green peas and quail eggs yum!!

The beef tartar was really fresh and was dressed with just the right amount of capers, sauce and whatever they bind it in without taking away from the flavour of the beef. 

I tried a bite of my sister's octopus lentil salad and it was delicious! She raved about it and cleared the whole plate. 

I love this resto and I've also heard nothing but great things from others who have visited on more than one occasion. This place is a must when visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"What a gem in Montreal. Incredibly unassuming and easily missed, L'Express is a tucked away spot of deliciousness. I had some of the best octopus over ever had here. Succulent, tender, and buttery. My husband got a roasted hen dish (which we never order chicken at a restaurant), but we were so tired of eating heavy we went for it. Chicken was so well brined and moist all around. The bread, butter, pickles- nom."}
{"text":"The absolute highlight of the meals we enjoyed during our trip to Montreal!

We blew in with the snow - giant globs of snowflakes clinging to our hair and coats, and they whisked us to our table near the corner of the restaurant. We started with loaves and loaves of french bread (their bread was DELICIOUS. As was their butter!). We couldn't stop talking about their bread for the entire weekend!

Everything we ordered was perfectly seasoned and presented. Everyone enjoyed their entrees immensely! The steak frites were the best I've had anywhere, as was the steak tartar! 

Make reservations and please go, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Overall I had a pleasant experience here. But after reading reviews, I thought that the food would be better. The decor reminds you of a traditional French Bistro. 

Food 3.5/5:
Surprisingly I really enjoyed their pickles and bread. Their pickles are delicious and the bread was soft and had a lovely crunchy crust.

The appetizers were my least favourite; a little disappointing. We ordered to octopus salad. It was okay, but not something that I would order again. It was nicely presented and they gave you a lot of octopus, but I felt that it needed some more acid.

We also ordered the chicken liver pistachio pate. We found this too rich for our liking, and the pistachio over powered the taste of the liver. 

We did enjoy our mains. i ordered the homemade ravioli, which was delicious. The pasta was delicate, and the gravy that the ravioli was covered in was delicious. The filling inside was tasty and a bit creamy. The mushrooms complimented the dish nicely, and gave the dish a bit of an earthy texture.

My fiance ordered the shrimp risotto. The risotto was cooked perfectly. The rice was creamy and the shrimp was perfect - not over cooked. The cherry tomatoes gave a nice acidic relief, from the creaminess of the sauce. I would definitely recommend that you try either of these dishes.

For dessert we decided to get the Floating Island. It looked amazing with the sugar dome and the meringue inside and custard on the bottom. It was like a work of art. I can appreciate the difficulty of making the dessert. I enjoyed the almond praline the most. The meringue didn't have much taste other than sweetness. Overall the dessert was too sweet for my tastes, and a didn't live up to the presentation.

Service 4.5/5 
Service was excellent for the most part, until it came time to pay the bill, which was a bit slow. Our servers were pleasant and very efficient. When asked for recommendations they were quick to answer. They were also quick to clear our plates when we finished our dishes. Although it was busy, we didn't feel rushed and were able to take our time and enjoy our meal.

The restaurant is quite popular, and we saw lots of locals. The place is busy, so definitely make a reservation if you decide to come here."}
{"text":"It makes no bones about it that it is a bistro and it is a very good bistro because its menu really is much more refine than others.  I loved the bone marrows and everything else was great.  My hubby who is Parisien thinks it is very close to a good bistro in Paris. I highly suggested this place when anyone lands in Montreal, they open to 2 a.m!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good but not amazing, not much to choose from. They had a menu in french and a separate menu with 6 different languages which was very useful. I probably would not go again since the food is not worth the price"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've ever had and I really don't take that lightly. their house ravioli omg better than ones in Italy which let me tell you are difficult to beat and the desserts are superb the ile flottante was gorgeous and so delicious! reservations are necessary but this restaurant felt like I was in France so the planning was worth it. The waitstaff look like something from an authentic French bistro and they're fast and knowledgable. Seriously best French in Montreal!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Montreal. I'm a Montrealer and the service and food are always done the same. Always happy when I arrive and leave. Real professionals

That being said. This is a French bistro style restaurant. The specialty, is doing the same menu and service for many years since its inception. Check out their web site and read the chefs page. It gives you an idea of what the mantra is at L'Express. They do offer a few dishes that aren't on the regular menu, which I have tried and are done well. But for me it's the regular menu that my steak always comes out the same as the last time I was there. 

If you want a multiple course menu with wine pairing Montreal has many others that do that. This place holds its success on its professionalism \"haute service\" of a well served meal, a moderate to well priced wine list and a nice espresso with desert."}
{"text":"Excellent service, solid food, & reasonable prices. I ate the left over (we over ordered with 3 apps and an entree) fois gras for breakfast the following morning and it was still delightful. I will always come back to this place."}
{"text":"This is, by far, my favourite restaurant in Montreal. 

GO FOR BRUNCH.
The brunch menu is cheap and you are still in the classy gorgeous restaurant and its just...amazing. 

Dinner is good too, but quite a lot more pricey, and generally pretty average French...meaning the menu is very meat based and such, but the brunch is what makes this place so great for me.

The compote is literally one of the best things that I have ever put in my mouth. I asked to take a bin of it as take-out so I could bring it home to Toronto...they said no :-( and its only available at brunch...another reason to go for brunch."}
{"text":"We asked the hotel concierge for the restaurant recommendation and the first name that came out of his mouth was L'Express. He kindly made a reservation for us even though it was for 10pm...but we were glad we had the reservation because the place was packed even at 10pm!!  Loved the ambiance, very Parisien classic bistro with cute checkerboard floor minus snobbish and arrogant Parisien attitude. Even if you don't speak le Fran√ßais there's no need to feel intimidated because the waiters here are bilingual and friendly. 

The food here was pretty good! You can try various Quebecoise fromages which were high quality, highly recommended!!! The complimentary pickles in the jar were very good. Both steak tartar and hanger steak were pretty good overall, but I've had better hanger steaks in NY. The chocolate cake I had for dessert was soooo rich, I mean, it was like eating a big chunk of truffle!

{"text":"We had an excellent French brunch at this excellent French restaurant. We had the croque monsieur (second best we've ever had), the quail , and the duck confit salad. All excellent with a side of French flare. Loved the service and the ambiance and the delicious cornichons for the table. Definitely recommended if you're in the area."}
{"text":"If you google \"what restaurant has the best croque Monsieur in Montreal L'Express repeatedly comes up on the list. I've never been to France and while I hope to make it one day to eat the real deal I usually get my fix at Tartine in SF. However, L'Express was REALLY good. Italian bread, though I admittedly expected French baguette but the meat was good the cheese was so melty and I enjoyed every bite. Here were greens with lemon and olive oil, simple but fresh. Def a good place if you're looking!"}
{"text":"Great, attentive, knowledgeable bilingual staff (French/English) all in a nice looking venue

Bread, butter, mustard and pickles at the ready pretty much from when you are seated. Recommend making reservations as it can get full!

Good portions but probably \"small\" for most Americans.

Soup
Slight cream, vegetable, strong lemon citrus,
Excellent flavor and perfect fit for a cold -3 night with a bit of pepper.

Home made ravioli.
Sauce was amazing. Sweet, caramelized onion, mushroom, on deliciously fresh ravioli-very delicious. The meat is great with good seasoning but is all behind the strong sauce.

Chocolate Creme brulee with nuts.
Great nutty chocolate flavor. A little too burnt for my preferred taste although definitely nothing wrong with the dessert. Paired with the decaf espresso and really worked well together.

Check this place out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Classic. Small portions. Friendly staff. Good ol' Montreal charm. Not sure why they put wild rice on top of radicchio though?"}

{"text":"4.5  stars, to be exact

This restaurant is wonderful; loved the art-deco feel, the top-notch service, and delicious food.

The meal started with baby pickles, dijon mustard and crusty bread and butter.  All three were wonderful; I never thought I liked dijon mustard; this mustard was homemade and was very tasty.  I'm a convert.

Next came the warm goat cheese salad and bone marrow; both were also delicious.  The bone marrow was served with crusty bread and sea salt; the sea salt was a nice touch.

My husband ordered the pork, mushroom and escargot in a citrus marinade.  This was also very good, but I would have preferred the Chef used a different, fattier, cut of pork.  The pork was a tad dry, but overall presentation and taste was excellent.

The creme brulee with hazelnut was to die for.

Highly recommend if you are in the area; we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  For such a youthful city bustling with hip, energetic restaurants and bars, this place was a little stodgy, but a favorite among disappointed parents and their adult children who regrettably agreed to meet them for dinner.  The two dishes that stood out as most memorable?

Bone marrow - steamed, not roasted.  Boring, bland and a little gross.  Cut it lengthwise and roast it the way our paleo ancestors did!

Octopus Salad - again, flavorless.  Both the texture and the taste of the Octopus and the Lentils absolutely did not compliment each other."}
{"text":"This is the best bistro in all of Montreal! The service was OUTSTANDING. We stopped by after the place was recommended to us by a nice French couple we met walking down the avenue. The place isn't easily visible because the sign was literally on the GROUND (which is probably for the best because it keeps out the tourist riff raff), plus the whole menu was in French (hand-written in cursive).

We had no idea what in the world we were getting into, but our servers (I think their names were Josee and Anthony) were AWESOME. We were honest and told them we didn't know what to order so we took the adventurous route and told them to bring us anything they wanted. And wow, what awesome picks.

If you're ever in town, make it a point to add this place to one of your restaurant visits!"}
{"text":"What a great little bistro. I had the escargot over pureed peas as an app and a lamb shank as my main. I was in the mood for the traditional garlic and butter escargot, but the way L'express prepared was even better. The lamb was a huge portion and was wonderfully cooked. My wife and I shared a great piece of cheesecake for dessert. We also enjoyed a great bottle of 2005 Bordeaux. Service was excellent. Atmosphere was traditional French - zinc bar, black and white checkered floor, etc. Definitely a great place to go if you're in the mood for an old school bistro, and its open until  2 am."}
{"text":"Classic French bistro, you get a sense of how people have been dining for decades and decades. 
We didn't make a reservation so they sat us at the bar, the servers move like an art form, weaving by each other, their fingers cleaning the glassware like playing piano.

Foie gras terrine - served with apple jelly, amazing balance of sweet and savory.
Bone marrow - three pieces cut width wise, delicious no matter what - but might be a bit hard to get to even with the tiny spoons. Self serve salt. 
Shrimp risotto - the risotto to die for. Perfectly cooked and the shrimp is done just right.
Beef tartar - very good and not skimpy on the capers. It's a bit spicy for those who cannot handle horse radish kind of spiciness and the salad that comes with it is good as well. 
Beef ravioli - The sauce was very delicious, we used the extra bread to soak up the remaining sauces. Wish there was more - there were only 5 ravioli! 

Dessert wise - the meringue dome is impressive but it's rather big and if I were to come back I would skip this one. 

Everything was a knockout, thank you L'express! Merci"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been here for 34 years serving French classique dishes. The service and the ambiance is great. We had the duck rillette with French pickles, the saut√©ed mushroom and the ravioli. They were all good. For sure l express is on my list of restaurant during my next  visit on Montreal."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here on a Friday night and we really liked it. The food was very fresh and you could tell the restaurant uses high quality ingredients. I loved the pickles and dijon mustard appetizer.

It is a great space and we had a great waiter. Overall an excellent experience that you shouldn't pass up."}
{"text":"Let me start by stating that I don't have a lot of experience eating or preparing french food and some of the dishes and methods of french food prep don't really appeal to me, but since we were in Montreal, we wanted to eat at a french restaurant so we made a reservation at L'express based on Yelp reviews.

We skipped appetizers as none appealed to us although they served some really good bread.  For mains, I really decided to go french and had the hanger steak with fries (sarcasm).  It was really good; not a big thick steak like in states but thin and really tender and flavorfull.  Not sure how they tenderize or prepared it but it was very good.  My wife had the homemade raviolis which on this day were meat and mushroom filled, and served with some type of beef sauce.  They were really rich and tasty.  We split a chocolate tart for desert and that was good too.

Overall we enjoyed our meal here."}
{"text":"I love the aura in this place. I first came here late night for dessert. it was really good and I decided to come back. I went with a friend and we got one appetizer, two main courses and a dessert. Besides the dessert, i thought that the food was rather bland. The good thing about this place is that it is open late. I may go back if I need to grab food late at night or for the desserts."}
{"text":"No matter how many kind reviews have been written about this Montreal institution in the past, it's worth adding on if only to mention their remarkable consistency through the years. My wife and I come here around New Years once a year, and it always manages to exceed expectations. Food, drink, service, and ambiance are all impeccable. It's the kind of place that makes other restaurants within their price range look bad, as it really sets the bar high for fine, yet casual dining. This is what treating yourself to a nice meal should be."}

{"text":"As a New Yorker, and a native one at that, it is said that New York has more French Bistros than France itself. And many great ones to add - i.e. Les Halles, Le Gamin, Jacques, Bar ta Bac, Provence.... 

Our hotel concierge advised us against this one and suggested one closer to the hotel called \"Holder\" - we should have listened. The highlight of actually going to L'express was walking through the multicolored convention center to catch the metro. Located in what the Montrealers call the \"Latin Quarter\" - really I didn't see any Latins, but many other fine little eateries. The place was not as lively as I would have expected it to be on Saturday night at 10pm. It was all maroon inside and had the feel of a pretentious diner. The service was OK, not impressive, but at least not snooty. 

I asked the waiter for a half bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon and he brought me out and opened up a bottle of Merlot. We ordered the hanger steak and frites and the Lobster Risotto. We were for-warned by a local that the French bistros do not provide the quantity for the price they will charge and I just didn't get the hype after I got and tasted my food. I have to add though, that the Risotto had a generous quantity of lobster meat in it. I was afraid it would be aborrio rice with essence of Lobster - like a bisque. But it pleasantly surprised me with the meat. Although, at this time, Lobster is unfortunately very cheap to buy this season due to overfishing - hence the generous portion of lobster meat. 

Because we didn't get enough food, we had enough room for desert and the Creme de Caramel l'orange was a true mouthful of chewy orange skin bits. The coffee  that we ordered to accompany it was over roasted because it had a burnt taste.  Maybe  that's what they liked? Eh, I'll just  go to Tim Hortons.  But the cup it came in was so heavy I had to hold it up with two hands each time to drink it.  A picture is posted for your viewing pleasure. 

Our total bill for one appetizer, two entrees, one desert and a half bottle of wine came out to $108 USD. Sorry, I just can't rave about this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming to l'Express for over 10 years and it never failed in their service and food quality. Amazing experience as always!"}
{"text":"Canada is nice - everyone is super polite and pushing is a no-no! A nice change of pace from NYC. 

When we walked in the host immediately knew we were from the States, so he asked if an English menu would help. We overwhelmingly said yes!

Starting with the Octopus and Lentil Salad was great idea. The salad can only be described as an upside down lentil-shaped bowl decorated with circles of octopus meat and tentacles. The floor of the dish was covered with a tangy vinagrette. The lentil seeds were fresh and the octopus was soft.  A combination that can be shared by 2-4 people. 

The complimentary pickles were amazing. They were like the vodka shots of the pickle family. These tiny pickles packed a sour, sour punch. The bread was not amazing, it was just good standard bread. 

Grain Fed Chicken with Greens - This thick slice of chicken breast sat in a brown sauce that was dynamic and savory. I don't really like chicken, but this is something I would happily gobble up. 

Duck Confit Salad - I always thought that warm food on top of cold salad would wilt the greens, but their salad stayed fairly crisp as I devoured its neighbor. The soft dark meat was flavorful, but i feel not as flavorful as it could have been. There were also smaller, bright red, rectangular pieces of duck that were amazing - soft and rich in flavor. The combination of the three pieces really made the dish. So, try to cram it all in your mouth =).  

Quail with Wild Rice - This was an amazing dish that I wish I had gotten. If you go, get this. There were several pieces of quail that you may need to eat with your hands, but it is well worth it. The quail was succulent and juicy - perfectly cooked. The wild rice was slightly crunchy, very hearty, and very savory. This dish was very dynamic and I can almost say, fun to eat! 

Sea Bass - The downer of the group. The sea bass was swimming in olive oil and although not cooked badly, it is not something worth driving all the way to Montreal. 

Dessert - Floating Island - This sufficiently fed 4 people, and I feel like this could even stretch to 6!  This was a dome of whipped egg whites encased in dark golden brown sugar glass floating on top of sugary waters. The dessert left me wondering about my dental health, but it was definitely interesting. If you want to try something new, try this. 

Overall, a very pleasant evening on a cold winter night."}
{"text":"This place is truly old school. From the decor to the service to the cuisine to the general feel.  The place was busy, which is usually a good sign. We set at the counter and had a nice time chatting with a pair of our neighbors and the lovely gentlemen waiting on us.

The menus were both in English and French and contained a generous but not overwhelming number of dishes.  The burrata, served in the form of a caprese salad was as good as it looked, fresh and delicately balanced. The octopus was overcooked, but I actually liked it nonetheless. The presentation on this one especially, screamed old French dinning. The lobster risotto and the steak were both very nice. They had a great selection of wines by the bottle and the whole experience was very reminiscent of dinners in Paris. It's as close to visiting Paris as you will get without leaving the continental America."}
{"text":"Oh my God, I LOVE this place!!! I called up my friend in Montreal for a great restaurant. He gave me 3-4 to choose from and kept saying try L'Express. We wanted to splurge on a nice dinner and NICE dinner we got! I met up with my friends from Montreal to cap off the night with some drinks. I'm so glad they were able to come out and catch up!

We couldn't get a table due to how popular this place is, so we opted to sit at the bar. Our waiter was so nice! My friend told the waiter to order anything that he thought best. I actually chimed in and said I wanted to order my own. So, my friend's dishes were all surprises while my dish surprised me on the WOW factor! 

We started off with a glass of wine. Then, they brought out some fresh bread, pickles, and mustard. I ordered the foie gras which was very decadent! My friend got the morel mushrooms on a crostini with arugula. Damn, this dish was so tasty! I loved how earthy the taste were and we both really enjoyed this appetizer!

For my main entree, I got the beef tartare. It was very fresh and the portion size was big. It also came with pomme frites which were fried perfectly. My friend got a medium rare steak that was very juicy and buttery. 

We ended the meal with biscotti with Vin Santo et Cantucci and an Irish coffee. It was a perfect ending to our Montreal trip! I would give this restaurant 6 stars if there was that option. Totally would recommend this place to anyone visiting Montreal!"}
{"text":"I great experience and an excellent bistro! Although this establishment was on he expensive side, the service was exceptional and the food was fantastic as well! I will definitely eat at this restaurant again next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Word is this place has gotten worse over the years. I have only been recently so I don't have a comparison but if it was better before, it must have been out of this world. My meal was great. Bone marrow and foie gras were delicious.
Also, I apparently like pickles now because they give you a jar and I couldn't stop eating them. Pregnant? Iunno. But this is a long aside. The food here was great."}
{"text":"I frequent Montreal 2-3 times a year for shopping and visited here on Yelp suggestions! It was a good suggestion too!   
   I took a cab from the airport directly to the restaurant. I arrived at 11:00am, and was told Lunch was not served until 11:30. So looking at the not so exciting breakfast menu, had cafe au lait and waited till 11:30
  The service was very reserved but friendly. I had the steak frits and a glass of Pomerol. The steak was perfectly cooked and wine was stellar. They served a jar of cornichons and mustard on the side. The simple bread and butter was amazing! Thanks yelpers!"}
{"text":"Make sure you aren't stupid Americans like us and try to get in here without a reservation. Food and service were worth meandering around the city in freezing temperatures and slipping and falling on my butt a few times while walking around trying to amuse ourselves until our table was ready. Chicken liver pate was easily one of the best I've ever had, and frankly, the price was right. Large enough to share but I wasn't big into that because who knows when ill have a pate like this again. Big thanks to the staff for a great dinner and for treating us like old friends."}
{"text":"Most enjoyable. Good simple bistro food in a typical Parisian style space. The boss had steak frites which she enjoyed immensely, even more than the steak that she had at Joe Beef at a third of the price. I had veal liver which was really good. The L'express frites are really good. The place was buzzing."}
{"text":"I agree with all of the many positive reviews of this French bistro so all I can add is that I found all of the servers knowledgeable about the menu and they made excellent wine suggestions. It's also nice that they are open late (I dined at midnight)."}
{"text":"I go to L'express at least once every time I visit Montreal.
steak de canard, foie gras terrine, soup de poissons, and bison steak are my favorites.   Everything is perfectly seasoned and cooked.  Simple and tasty, all substance no pretense.
Forget about waiting to get a table, too much trouble, grab a seat at the bar
and enjoy.  Neighboring diners are usually very friendly."}
{"text":"WOW. Just WOW. Firstly, the atmosphere was so nice! It was yes French bistro feel because yes it is a French bistro! The servers were super attentive and friendly. I really enjoyed my experience. My boyfriend and I ordered 6 oysters, bone marrow (my gawd...holy...so good), and steak tartare, with side of fries for me salad for him. I read on this blog that their beef tartare was one of the top places to order this dish. I was not disappointed. It had a nice spicy kick with capers and other dreamy stuff. 

The oysters were divine, and the bone marrow, which was my first time eating it was crazy good. It was so rich I swear I think I wanted to cry from its super delicious-ness. Definitely try their bone marrow for appetizer and definitely order their beef tartare. It was seriously good. Recommend recommend! Come by this restaurant if you are in the plateau area. It is really close to Sherbrooke metro, I would say 5-10 min walk. Great neighborhood too. As for pricing, well it's French food for you, so don't expect to come in paying less than 25-30 bucks. But if the pricing doesn't matter to you, really worth the splurge once in awhile."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience here very much. Beet salad was wonderful, Croquet Monsieur was very good and hubby liked steak and frites. Good service. English menus. Perfectly Parisian, very authentic. However, VERY loud and not very romantic per se. Could use a bit more atmosphere, soft lighting or music imo."}
{"text":"L'Express is one of my all-time favorites when visiting Montreal - its the epitomy of the traditional french bistro - the interior still has the original black and white tiled floor, aged wood bar area, paper covered tables, the wait staff even still bear the traditional black with long white aprons in honor of their rich french history. Upon entering I believe that there is no longer the sign outside bearing their name but ask anyone on the street and they will point you in the right direction. If you are looking for fois gras - you will die and go to heaven here!! You might even brush up on your french here - from the menu to the staff - this bistro feels like a storybook to me! Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was our choices. Maybe we've had too much Quebecois cuisine. Maybe it was because we went to Brasserie T the night before. Make no mistake that this is a truly great restaurant, but it did not rise to 5-star. The bone marrow appetizer was tasty but not a revelation. The rillettes l'express was not as good as the duck rillettes at Brasserie T. My sauteed canard confit was fine, as was my son's hanger steak with frites. On the plus side, the decor is excellent, the service is top flight, and the atmosphere (like everywhere in Montreal, it seems) is comfortable and inviting. We spent CAD 108, with tip and tax; two cocktails, no wine. BTW - extensive wine list but a lot of choices looked pricey."}
{"text":"I agonized whether or not to go to L'Express. Would they be rude to a mostly English speaker? Would it live up to the hype? 

I'm glad I went. My experience was lovely. Every dish was classic and spot on and my service was excellent. 

Gorgeous salad verte. Fresh gazpacho. Amazing pate and asparagus. 

They were even accommodating without reservations (at 11am on a weekday) and everyone was kind to my dining companion, my 7-year-old daughter."}
{"text":"Dinner at L'Express is the dining experience. The Octopus salad is fresh tasting. The steak frites cooked medium tantalized my taste buds to the very last bite.   Service is the best, the staff is super attentive and considerate.  Call ahead and reserve a table to avoid a wait. Do come here you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was good though not terribly remarkable. My sister and I came here after reading a lot of reviews that this was a must try place while here in Montreal. Indeed, it felt like an intimate but bustling French bistro off of a central street, and the food was good - loved the bone marrow and especially the shrimp risotto! However, I was a little surprised by the service. It felt slow and inattentive and it wasn't until I mentioned that my sister was running the marathon the next day that we got constant refills of water. We're Americans, so perhaps we have different expectations of speed of service, I will give the restaurant that. Despite the service though, I thought the place was good, and almost great. Definitely worth a stop if you're looking for French food that is simple and traditional."}
{"text":"A highlight of my week of eating in Montreal.  We made a reservation the day of just in case it was crowded, which was a great idea.  We were seated quickly, though we had to wait an oddly long period of time (did they forget about us?) but other than that the service was impeccable.  Cozy little place crammed with tables, no sign in the front, full of older business-looking people and their families/friends.  We were definitely the youngest patrons.  

After the bread, butter, mustard, and pickles came out, we started with the incredible bone marrow.  It was just fat, but a big glob of it with a bit of sea salt on the toast was an amazing culinary experience that melted in your mouth with so much flavor.  I can't recommend it enough.

Then we had the tartare (i ordered it epice or spicy), which came with fries and was quite yummy, as well as the saute of confit de canard on salad which was incredible.  Very flavorful duck perched on a lightly dressed salad with mini croutons and fried pancetta (perhaps); everything about the dish was good.  

The only disappointment of the meal was the dessert, when we ordered an ile flottante (floating island).  Because of the fairly classical execution on the dishes so far, I was looking forward to the usual bowl of creme anglaise topped with that exquisite island of edible cloud to remind me of Paris, as the rest of L'Express does.  But instead we had a plate of custard with a gigantic mound of meringue coated in a FAR TOO SWEET thick coat of brulee, vaguely maple flavored.  I ended up pushing aside the candy coating and eating the rest of the dessert, which was fine but needed more of that yummy vanilla cream custard.

Despite the dessert and weird wait before ordering, however, this place still merits 5 stars from me-great service, good ambiance, and very very good food.  It was a perfect last meal in Canada, and our bill including tip was about $80 CAD."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in town I make a bee-line for this place. L'Express is by far one of the best French bistros in Montreal and well worth paying them a visit if you have not already had the pleasure. Reservations are highly recommended as this place is almost always packed - and they close at 2am!

Tucked away on St. Denis, this place can be a little tricky to find (no sign) and locals probably like it this way. Like the name of the restaurant, the d√©cor of L'Express has the feel of old French train car. A long copper bar, black and white checkered floor, and a few potted palm trees really adds to the ambiance of a Parisian bistro from days long gone. Tables are close together, so expect noise levels to be energetic, which in my opinion, adds to the bistro's joie de vivre environment.   

I've been coming here for few years now and the menu pretty much seems to stay the same with the exception of some daily specials (For Anglophones, there is an English version upon request). Some of their staple dishes we ordered were the bone marrow appetizer, which was perfectly textured (think meat-flavored pudding), steak tartare, had just the right amount seasonings, saut√© de canard confit, and my favorite, pot-au-feu - all really incredibly delicious! Lol, I really think though, it's all about the jar of cornichons period. Wine was beautifully paired, at the suggestion of our waiter, with a bottle of Pessac-Leognan 2008 Grand Vin de Bordeaux. 

Service was unpretentious and exceptional as always. The waiters work along with assistant waiters and have their service down to science. I've never had any negative experiences here and will visit L'Express every time I come to Montreal. I highly, highly recommend paying them a visit.

Merci pour la nourriture delicieuse!"}
{"text":"I was in Montreal for work, and my mom visited me and asked if we can go somewhere with authentic French Food. This was a recommendation from a co-worker and it was SO good!

The small place on St. Denis immediately gave you a Parisien feel. The food wasn't too expensive, and good portions for the meal. People were friendly and we felt very comfortable, even with a small child running around. 

I liked it alot and would definately come back here. I really felt I had good value for money, which is important to me. Quality and Quantity of food."}
{"text":"We were vacationing in Montreal and looked for a must-go restaurant. No matter which list we saw, L'Express was there. It sounded like a safe bet... Unfortunately, it wasn't.

The restaurant tries to maximize its seating, which is accepted... but at first we were seated in a table located just at the entrance to the kitchen, with lots of movement around us. Per my request, we were moved to a table that was just being cleaned.

Food - Even what we liked, was not that good.. The beets soup was maybe the jewel of the meal. The rest was dull and boring. The stew that we ordered was tasteless and more than half of it was left on the plate, without anyone asking us how it was. 

Service - Polite, but we felt no care attitude from our waiter.

As someone who lives in NYC, I completely agree with Gokhan T.'s review, that says that for the money I put into this place, I could dine in a Michelin Restaurant in NY."}
{"text":"We had the escargot appetizer, it was unique and delicious.  For dinner we had the homemade tri-meat ravioli with mushroom sauce and the hanger steak with shallot butter and fries.  We had the maple creme brule, a chocolate truffle, and a macaroon for dessert.  All was amazing.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is superb- a must visit for culinary curiosity seekers.

Decor/Ambiance- 5/5 
Lovely French Bistro atmosphere. The place is long and brightly pleasantly lit. Though we sat near the door, the heat vanquished the cold. The menus come in numerous different languages.

Service -5/5
Our waiter seemed so enthusiastic about helping us that we couldn't help but get more excited about the food. He brought an entire pickle jar for us to eat pickles at our leisure, and allowed us to taste various wine before making a selection. In addition, he also helped us with clear directions.

Food - 4.5/5
The appetizers and entrees were simply excellent. Our Bone Marrow arrived with nice little leaves covering the marrow and crunchy toasted bread. The scallops were also delicious. Consume them fast however. Our entrees Shrimp Risotto and Duck Confit Salad were heavenly. The risotto was generously portioned and disappeared in our mouths within minutes. I had some trepidation initially with the duck confit salad, but the second I ate some, I was hooked. Crispy duck bits populate a bed of fresh greens, creating a unique and flavorful taste.

The only knock was the dessert- the flottante. I no longer have the sweet tooth that I possessed while younger and the caramelized exterior was just too much for us. But the interior was delicious.

Bottom line- Go Go Go."}
{"text":"The restaurant is really nice on the inside, it really does feel like you're in a bistro in France. I came here on a whim after a comedy show at late at night. When my date said 'let's go eat somewhere' at 12am, I was thinking some type of fast food, but I was really delighted to end up in such a classy place. 

Good : The steak tartare. It's a huge portion the capers really added flavor to it. Oh, and that home made ravioli...amazing. 

Bad : It's a bit on the pricy side, but then again it's not your average 12 am food spot. My date ordered way to much food, and me being the glutton that I am, I kept eating until I felt sick. My fault.

Bottom Line : Excellent restaurant, loved the meals, would return."}
{"text":"There are many special dishes on menu I haven't seen in other restaurants. I love the elegant environment but the staff is quite busy. My husband and I made a reservation for celebrating New Year's eve. It was  our first time here to have half bottle of champagne. The staff spilt a little on the table. 
We had the octopus & lentil salad and the crusty bread topped on very special bone marrow with coarse salt. Pickles really helped balancing greasy feeling.
The main courses we ordered grilled salmon and sea bass with grilled vegetables is just ok. The flavor and presentation of sea bass was better than salmon excepted I got four fish bones from sea bass. We had the floating island to share. The glace icing was very sweet and thick.

Bone marrow and floating island were interesting dishes to us, but personally I don't like the oily and meringue texture."}
{"text":"Wow.
I had high expectations coming in, and every one of them was met!
* service - top notch!
* Atmosphere - great!
* Food - to die for!
I made reservations (because calling an hour beforehand just didn't work - they were fully booked) and came with my family. Throughout the meal, the service was fantastic and very attentive. Every unused dish was picked up swiftly, the empty bread baskets were quickly replaced with full ones. The only time they forgot something was when asked for Parmesan for the pasta dish - my partner had to ask twice. Also, this pasta dish was the only vegetarian main on the menu, and was just OK according to her. This is not a good place for vegetarians - but the rest of us had the best meal ever:
We started with bone marrow (Yammi! cooked just right) and then moved to the chicken pate (good). These are very good dishes to split three-way (you get three bones).  For the mains we had the veal kidney in mustard sauce (fantastic, rich meat flavours), the hunger steak with fries (as expected, simple but good steak and good fries), and the shrimp risotto (yammi!). 
For dessert we shared the signature desert (ill folttante with caramel) - this one looks great and it's an instagrammer's dream. it's fine for the pallet as well. However, the surprise desert of the evening was the coffee cream brule - well executed classic french with a twist. We let our waiter know how much we liked it and he told us that he agrees that it is great, but they change the flavour every two weeks. Last week's tea flavour was not as good in his opinion... 
To sum up - very nice evening. Book ahead."}
{"text":"I think this place is overrated. Bone marrow was definitely worth it. Fish soup was not what I expected. It was more like tomato soup with slices of toasted cheese bread (from the same baguette they serve complimentary). Duck confit salad gave a good portion of meat, but I prefer my meat crispier. I was expecting to be awed, but ended up paying a premium for items that tasted ordinary. Meh."}
{"text":"A lot of folks suggested that we go here and lauded the food. I can report that it is indeed a great place to eat, and that both the service and a cuisine was top notch. The steak itself was cooked very well, although the fries weren't as good. The quail on the menu was a surprise hit. I don't think I've ever had wild rice prepared so well at a restaurant. The cr√®me caramel desert had an orange flavor that was delightful."}
{"text":"Beautifully executed, scrumptious, classic French cuisine. 

Great service, lovely dining experience. And most importantly, the food was wonderful. 

I refer you to my pictures."}
{"text":"I was in Montreal recently and we were looking for a place that served great Steak Tartare, a lot of people online recommended L'Express, so off we went to L'Express on a Wednesday night.

Service: It was definitely above average, we unfortunately didn't make reservations but they created a table for us. The waiter wasn't really fluent in english but he did his best to explain everything to us.

Food: My partner had the steak tartare with fries and it was fantastic and the portions were generous. I had the roasted quail which was amazing, the meat just fell off the bones.

Ambience: It was a nice ambience and brightly lit, and I enjoyed the fact that it was very traditional based off my past experiences."}
{"text":"The meal kicked off with a few of my favorite things:

-Jar of pickles
-Crusty french bread 
-Dijon mustard 
-Bottle of Malbec

Things could only go uphill from there. And that they did. My fianc√© and I split a goat cheese salad to start. Crispy mesclun lettuce in a tangy vinaigrette, topped with four large slabs of creamy goat cheese. Let's GO. Next up were entrees - a perfectly cooked medium rare steak topped with garlic butter and served with a side of crispy fries and aioli for dipping. Let's keep going, shall we?  After that we enjoyed a bowl of meat, cheese and spinach filled ravioli topped in a rich and hearty mushroom sauce. Everything that we ate was beautifully presented and looked almost too perfect to eat. But, we did eat and finished every last drop of food on our plates.

Want authentic French food while visiting Montreal? Want to feel like you are dining in Paris? Visit L'Express immediately. Just be sure to call ahead. We did not and were lucky to snag two of the last seats in the house (at the bar). The service is a little bit snooty, but the food was so good that they literally could have scowled at me all night and I wouldn't have cared. 5 stars and then some for L'Express."}
{"text":"Classic bistro fare done impeccably well. Wait staff is old school and very professional. Bread is perfectly crusty. I had the beet salad. Amazing! And then the kidney with mustard sauce, another bistro classic, and it was perfect. Paired with a nice medium body glass of Barbera d'Asti. I dined alone at the bar. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"A nice place to come late and eat. Will not disappoint.

The restaurant name is on the floor outside spelled out in tiles, so you might miss this restaurant if you drive by quickly.

It looks cute inside.. 

There is your French Bistro stuff like bone marrow and hardboiled egg with mayo. There is quite a bit to choose from and the portions are fair sized - not gigantic obesity size, nor miniscule anorexia size.

Save room for dessert and order as much dessert as possible. The maple sugar tart was the best (it might be seasonal, though). Baba rum ball was good too if you like rum.

It is a nice place, L'Express Restaurant. You will not find gobs of crap and lardy tarts like at some chain restaurants. Also you get nice polite service, not in-your-face, fake jokes and stupid pretending to be friendly tip-hungry crap like in some American places.

I'm hungry..."}
{"text":"Close to the best service i have ever had. The food was good but waiters should come to this place to learn how to work. Very professional and creative. I will be coming back specifically for this place."}
{"text":"Good Ole Faithful French Classic Bistro. Last minute decision to go at the busy lunch time. I like to eat something that I normally do not cook at home so I chose the Veal Liver! Tender to cut and butter to the mouth served with gravy and Fries. My stomach  was happy!!! Creme  Br√ªl√©e L'orange and Cappuccino for the Finale....."}
{"text":"Worth the five hour drive. I come here every time I am in Montreal. Fantastic classic French cuisine with great service."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant, anyone who lives or visits Montreal has to make a stop at this gem of a French Bistro. I had the pot au feu and I was in heaven. You can't go wrong at  L'express."}
{"text":"Honestly I had quite high expectations for L'express because I heard great things about this place. I came for lunch with family and we were a group of eight. I must say the ambiance and the service was 10/10. No complaints on that. They did forget one of our appetizers but that's okay and they got it out asap.

As for the food I must say it was nothing extraordinary and I didn't feel it was worth the price tag. I posted photos of all the dishes we bought and out of them the ones we thought were on the better side were: shrimp risotto, hangar steak, quail and the fish soup. 

The escargot and the os de moelle honestly were the most disappointing. Escargot was nothing special and the bone marrow was drenched in grease. If that's how it was supposed to be then I don't know why anyone would order it. The ravioli also had too much sauce, and the chicken breast was dry (as expected). The grilled salmon was also very disappointing. I guess if I would choose one dish to recommend it would be the shrimp risotto."}
{"text":"The food was really nice and the atmosphere was great. It's beautiful inside. A very French style bistro. The service was great until it got busy and then it went downhill. But prior to that it was great. I recommend going to try it out."}
{"text":"I'm not the one to be stingy when it comes to food but L'Express was rather pricey for what it was. Given the high ratings, I was excited to try this restaurant but was disappointed that it was another one of those overrated restos.

Had the octopus and lentil salad, which was rather flavorless. Shared a fish soup with my boyfriend, which tasted pretty good. Wish they had French onion soup on the menu though, as I was craving that before I came in. For my main, I had the poached salmon, which was served atop some mashed potatoes with a cream sauce surrounding it. Again, the dish was rather flavorless and felt very heavy. While they did have a lemon slice for me to squeeze lemon juice over it, I do wish they added something a little bit acidic (say pickled veggies) to cut the overall creaminess of the dish.

Service was overall friendly and no complaints there. Unfortunately, food quality was just not up to par."}
{"text":"I was a New Yorker in Montreal for my birthday when I came across L'express in a tour book.  It was highly recommended and, even though that's usually a sign for me to run the other way from the tourists, I decided to give it a chance.

I was immediately impressed by the clientele.  Young, old, folks dressed up in furs, people casually wearing jeans, friends, business partners, couples.  I felt that everyone was here because of one thing.  Good food.  We didn't have a reservation and the place was packed.  But I prayed to the Birthday gods and we only had to wait about 10 mins before we had a table.

What we ate:

Cornichons and Bread (free for table)
Ham and Cheese Quiche with Salad
Hanger Steak with herb butter and fries
Quail with Wild Rice 
Creme Caramel a l'orange 

I wish I had ordered the Quiche as my main course, it was so good.  The crust was flaky and on a cold Montreal night, it really hit the spot.  The hanger steak was delicious and way too much I had to share it.  The quail was tender.  The only complaint from my husband was that the wild rice was \"Just okay\".  By the end of the meal all that was left was a few stray fries.  The creme caramel was velvety and the sauce sweet without being too orangey-bitter.

The service was polite and efficient.  The atmosphere unpretentious bistro style.  The price tag a little high but what the hell.  Happy Birthday to me!"}
{"text":"On our way home from Quebec City, we made a quick stop in Montreal for lunch, (boy do I live the life). Great location near fun shops and other eateries. Sat at the bar. Not the best service, I felt slightly ignored the entire time. 
Ordered a beer- Griffintown Montr√©alaise- which was light but good. Got nice bread to start and a huge jar of gherkins- too bad I dont really like them! I had the sauteed duck confit with salad for lunch-- which was fresh, delicious and huge. Lots of delicious veggies, and TONS of perfectly cooked and seasoned duck. Best salad EVER (makes up for the poor service). My friend has the beer tartare.. which was also a HUGE portion, and she said it wasnt her fave, but definitely was good. It's pretty expensive here, and the place was full for a random Wednesday afternoon. Not sure I'd come back, but had a great, filling lunch!"}
{"text":"Love how low key and not trendy this place is.  Plus it is open until 3 AM.  It is a bit loud.  The food is great.  I wish this restaurant were in my city.  I might just give up cooking and eat there every night for dinner. 

Starting a meal with cornichons and great mustard is always a plus.  I had a beet salad.  The lettuce tasted freshly picked and it was perfectly dressed.  My husband's celery root remoulade was damn tasty.  He had the quail.  I had the halibut.  Both were excellent.  My lemon tart was nice too.  The custard was fluffy and lemony but not so much so as to make my mouth hurt as some lemon desserts can do."}
{"text":"Imported experience √† la fran√ßaise. Solid French food. Affordable wine by the glass like a proper bistro, $5. Older crowd. White tablecloths/tin bar. 

This place came recommended by many Yelpers and I would strongly suggest making a reservation a bit in advance. As a solo diner I had to wait an hour for just a seat at the bar. 

Service is as you'd expect √† la fran√ßaise: aloof and taking themselves VERY seriously. In a good way in terms of service, but don't expect your cartoony version of a chatty, friendly Canadian waiter. Fine by this antisocialite. ;)"}
{"text":"La bouffe, est ok, sans plus.  Pour le prix, facile de faire mieux. 
Le petit personnel semble s'ouffrir d'un curieux et √©trange complexe.  J'ai rarement √©t√© confront√© √† un service aussi d√©sagr√©able, d√©cal√© et odieusement pr√©tentieux !"}
{"text":"This was the best classic French style restaurant I found in Montreal.   Had the \"poulet des grains,\" which was a super juicy chicken with sage and lemon.  Asparagus as a warm up.  Dessert was Profiteroles a l'erable.  Erable is maple: the profiteroles had both maple ice cream and some maple syrup."}
{"text":"Wonderful food?  Yes.  Decent wine list? Absolutely. How people have been dining for decades and decades?  I think not. The very name of the place defies the ideal of gracious \"dining.\"  And truly French?  Never!  Paper napkins and the bussing station in plain sight?   Zut alors!"}
{"text":"wow.

my fave item was the chicken pistachio pate. that and the HUGE jar of cornichon. 

go here."}
{"text":"classic bistro.  a bit off the beaten track for us, not to bad of a walk from the metro.  place was hopping and had to wait for about 30 min to get our reserved table..but worth it.  had a drink at the bar and were seated before we could finish our drink.  service was excellent.  nice menu and all cooked to order and fresh. see picks.  not many comments on the calves liver, but you ever want to try it..this would be the place.  nice wine selection (by the glass was fine for us). no room for desert, but had a truffle..just right.  price point is fair. Absolutely will be back."}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended to me and as an American I was naive, I walked in on a Friday night after drinks and appetizers with some friends.  And load and behold there was a seat at the bar no wait, elbow to elbow with a local with her cycling helmet and a gentlemen dressed in a finely tailored suit.  And I am wearing a shorts and a t-shirt (us Americans are so horrible at dressing up while on vacation.

The service overall was really good, traditionally trained bartenders dishing out fine wines and suggestions for diners.  This place is straight up traditional, with the right food, service, and ambiance.  For me I had a glass of red wine and the duck confit salad, I am not normally a salad kind of guy, but I did not regret getting the salad.  The duck was seasoned well, the meat was moist, the greens were fresh (this is the end of August by the way) and the balance of the bitters and the sweets of the greens and the sweet meat was on point.

This is one salad I would eat again, but there are so many other great things on the menu if I was to go here again."}
{"text":"Good value and good food in the fashionable Plateau neighbourhood. The restaurant interior has a confident, classic look and feel. My shrimp risotto had the proper consistency (the rice was not overcooked). We shared an apple and blueberry crumble that I wished I had ordered for myself and didn't have to share. Excellent coffee."}
{"text":"Restaurant typiquement fran√ßais on se croirais dans un restaurant parisien tenue des serveurs, attention ou autres .
Il pourrait y avoir une am√©lioration sur les produits au vue du prix, car les plats sont un petit peu cher ( onglet √©chalote frites il pourrait faire une vrai sauce √©chalote ) 
Carte de vin superbe !"}
{"text":"Le cadre qui se veut rappeler les brasseries parisiennes est relativement r√©ussi. Mobilier, nappes blanches, serveurs tir√©s √† 4 √©pingles... et puis, il y a la nourriture.

{"text":"My first time in Montreal in a very long time, and to be honest have never heard of L'Express.

We were walking around looking for somewhere to go for dinner, when we serendipitously came across this place.  My sister had heard of it and said we would need a reservation and the place looked packed.  

She thought we might try.

We were lucky.  
We were asked by a Maitre'd/host? if we would mind sharing a table.  We did not mind.

Well, from start to finish, it was a wonderful dining experience.

My niece ordered the ravioli, wild mushrooms and goat cheese filling, in a sherry sauce.  You couldn't see the ravioli with all the mushrooms!  

I had the the roast chicken supreme.  Beautiful sauce, tender, moist chicken with beautiful crisped skin.  About 3 helpings of fresh peas, green beans and arugula and potato mille feulle!  All on one plate!

My sister had the salmon on a bed of spinach, which she thoroughly enjoyed.  The salmon was a generous sized fillet that was cooked to perfection, flaking and moist and an almost translucent center.  NOT cooked to tire grade rubber, as happens so many times.

We also had the celery remoulade and the green salad.  Bread, butter and cornichons were brought to the table.  Water was replenished without asking.

Wine service was excellent.

Service in general was welcoming, friendly, discreet, in a word excellent.

From the cost of a bottle of wine, to the prices on the menu, it was a very reasonable and night well spent."}
{"text":"I was there with my friend around 11 and it was good that they open late
you can still try good food at late night!"}
{"text":"This is true French. It's a busy, bright and vibrant atmosphere in a building that is not marked, except for the charming black-and-white tiled entryway. The servers are dedicated to their work and know their business - the kind of service that predicts what you'll need before you need it, and provides it without you noticing. The food is ostensibly simple, but artfully done, both in presentation and flavor. An easy example is the amazing crusty bread, cold butter, and cornichons they give you as you wait for your entrees. I could have happily eaten bread, butter, and pickles all night, but the ch√®vre chaud and canard confit were welcome interruptions - the duckiest duck and the cheesiest cheese! It's a wonderful place to linger over a glass of wine and the last bit of whatever you ordered - it doesn't matter, because it's all good. Just be sure to put in reservations early - they are busy even on weeknights!"}
{"text":"A true Parisian style restaurant. This place is pure class and quality. It's been around for a while and you still need a reservation days in advance if you expect to get in on a Friday or Saturday night.

When here, splurge for wine; most are private imports from France that you will not find elsewhere in the city.

Classic French food done properly at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in ages, thought, why not go back, see what it's like now; I recalled the lovely Parisien decor and  vibe¬∏ so hey I went, why not start off the New Year in style?  There is no prix fixe or table d'hote  lunch menu, and since I do NOT eat pork, veal or offal, there wasn't much for me to pick and choose. I finally settled on a poached salmon dish, which didn't come with much¬∏ ( $24.95) small chunk of salmon with chevril tinted mashed potatos. whoopie! Desserts go for a whopping $10.00 per pastry, coffee extra, of course. Since, I already had my sugar fill that day, I passed, but my companions said the desserts were so/so, with the exception of the apple/berry hot pudding. Nice to have revisited the place after so long a time, but that's it for me, dream's over."}
{"text":"Have been holding back on this review for a few weeks because I was disappointed at the time and wanted to consider the meal again from a distance. It was painfully average: the ambiance, the service and the food itself. L'Express had been recommended to me previously by a lovely couple I'd met in Montreal a couple of years prior. A woman at a bar in Toronto also mentioned it in passing. Two random recommendations for a restaurant in the Plateau Mont-Royal area? I was sold.

The area is uber-trendy, bustling and vibrant. L'Express has been a fixture in the neighborhood for decades, priding itself on classic French bistro fare. Maybe this is why I was surprised that the mood inside was dated and stale. It lacked the energy of the nearby restaurants. There's something to be said about tradition, but there's also something to be said about being flexible and revamping yourself over time. 

We ordered the bone marrow appetizer to start - always oily but perhaps not enough flair on this dish. Maybe flavored salt or some other garnish would have elevated it. Normally you can't go wrong with salt & fat on crusty bread, but it was banal in creation. It needed more. For our main, we split the hangar steak and frites. There's nothing more traditional about this standard bistro dish - and although the frites were fresh, the steak was on the chewy side. With every bite I tried to reconcile and defend it, but I couldn't get past the number of times I had to chew and chew and chew. Medium rare and difficult to choke down.

The creme br√ªl√©e dessert was flawless and the wine (Pinot noir and Bordeaux) complemented the meal nicely. It took a little bit longer than expected to obtain the bill.

Overall, this was probably a case of unrealistic expectations that colored an experience that could have gone two ways: viewing the restaurant as a stalwart that pays homage to the classics of French bistro dining, or being disappointed by a traditional giant that has failed to progress with the creativity of its neighbors. I'm sad to say the latter was my take, but I'd still go back in the hopes of finding the magic of convention."}
{"text":"It began awkwardly, as the host placed us in the middle of the restaurant, standing...waiting... for our reservation.  The night progressed.  We were seated.  It was a small room enhanced with a large mirror across one wall.  I found an expansion within myself as a sipped slowly the white nectar of sauvignon blanc (Saucerre - Gerald Boulay).  We debated whether wine is stomped by feet anymore.  A french lady at our hostel told us they still do.  Anyways, back to the story.  We paired our meals with our fine wines, and began to savor the spicy mustard/pickle/pepper bread concoction which tested the limits of our olfactory sense.  My friend Steve (Monseuir Steve) ordered the grilled salmon on a spinach bed.  He describes it tasting like an old salty man, dehydrated after an extended stay in the sauna.  It was at this point that I informed Monsuier Steve that if he wants to describe food as such to create his own posting.

Nevertheless I hit the jackpot with a savory selection of ravioli maison avec de la viande et de la sauce aux champignon.  I don't even speak french - and see what I can do now after eating!? Tres bien.  For dessert, we split 2 because we couldn't decide on one.  The first was a delightfully light and zesty mango and rasberry sorbet over a crunchy cookie sheet.  The second was a parfait.  I don't speak french, but it was perfecto.  It was designed as follows: top layer of maple-y creamy nougat; pear butterscotch middle layer; covering a bottom layer of port soaked plum.  I closed my eyes, cycling through the long history of desserts that I've experienced in my lifetime, trying to find a comparison.  Then i realized i was cycling through the wrong category of food.  It was not a dessert; instead i should have been cycling through my short list of orgasmic experiences."}
{"text":"I made a reservation online through their website and got a confirmation email right after. It was raining that day and I had a hard time looking for it since there was no sign outside. Well, the sign was on the floor. They did put me in the bar which was okay. They give you bread and butter after you put in your order. I didn't like the bread but I think the butter was good compared to other restos. I got the roasted quail with wild rice. The quail was perfectly cooked and seasoned well too. I think the wild rice lacks flavor though. For the price, I think the dish was worth it."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place after visiting the Botanical Garden.  Little did we know it was a Montreal establishment that lives up to the hype.  We ordered three dishes which were all amazing.  Ravioli, poached salmon and steak with fries.  The one dish that three employees all listed as their favorite was quail.  Will have to save for next time!"}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and attentive. Large wine list. The food was good, however nothing spectacular (order qual and duck confit with salad). One thing that was annoying is that the duck confit \"with\" salad was literally a salad with a very small of shredded duck in it, not the sliced duck on a bed of greens as you might imagine. If it were not for this, I would give 4/5."}
{"text":"The ultimate French bistro/restaurant in Montreal. It has maintained its quality over three decades. I cannot think of any place in France that would surpass L'Express in terms of service, food, wine and ambiance. It has an extensive menu, so there's something for everyone. There's no conspicuous signage outside, so those who come here know how wonderful it is. Five stars in all domains."}
{"text":"First time here. Seems like a very good place for above par late night food. I made an error in ordering the fish soup. It's not soup but rather bisque. Not a fan of their fish bisque at all. Service was fantastic so I plan on revisiting and giving this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Authentic French cuisine in a casual and comfortable setting. The steak tartar was amazing! One of the highlights of a recent trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"A very cute little French Bistro that serves you unlimited homemade pickles in cute little jars. The ambience is very cute, I felt like I was being transported in a small bistros in Paris. 

I had the Duck Confit which was served on top of a bed of greens. The dishes tasted like a very classical french duck confit, very flavourful and tender. The portions were a bit small for our liking (and for the price per dish, the duck was around 30$). 

On the other hand, service was great and friendly."}
{"text":"One of the most delicious meals I have ever had at a restaurant. I was in Montreal for the weekend and had dinner here with two friends one night. I had the cornish hen with wild rice-- and it was so so so good. Pricces were super reasonable too! I recommend this restaurant whenever anyone I know is visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"I came here with friends and we were all impressed with the various dishes we had ordered. L'express does a great job of using great ingredients and preparing all their dishes perfectly.

A typical French Bistro with a long history dating back to '81 judging from their wall of employee photos, I can see why it has lasted. If you are not paying attention or looking for it though, you can easily walk right past this place.

The name of the restaurant is tiled onto the floor just outside the restaurant, but there's no awning so keep your eyes peeled.  (At least there was no awning out when I was there)

There is ample space and the decor keeps it charming without seeming dated.  Wait staff was excellent, although I can certainly understand why some people might find them cold.

Keep in mind you're in Quebec where French is more dominant. It may be more an issue of English being the server's second language than it is a service issue.

All in all it was a very enjoyable experience and I would recommend trying anything on the menu as everything looked delicious."}
{"text":"More than perhaps any restaurant in North America, L'Express simulates what it's like to dine in a Parisian bistro.  It's got the real-deal French menu, and the Old World ambience is urbane and cosmopolitan, but also verging on the comfortably timeworn.  And, on weeknights at least, it seems to have regular clientele and staff who speak almost exclusively French and who seem like they've been dining here and working here for two or three decades.

If that's the experience you're looking for, I can't recommend it more highly.

But L'Express comes with so much hype from Yelp, Zagat, Urbanspoon, travel guides, etc., that I don't see how you can't be a bit disappointed by an actual experience here.  Ultimately, L'Express is a very nice restaurant and makes for a pleasant evening, but I don't think it really raises the bar that high when it comes to food, service, atmosphere, and so on. It serves mostly French standards.  (If you've been to Paris, you've probably had a better experience of this sort there in the same price range or even lower.  Or hell, you've probably had better French dining experiences in other North American cities.)  In other words, I think L'express earns B+ and A- grades all down the line, which is quite good, but hardly mind-blowing.  (Except for the authentic-bistro atmosphere, which is pretty close to an A+.) 

Bread and butter are good but not great, and we did like the jar of gherkins (with mustard) that the waiter brings to your table.  Sorrel soup was bold and almost perfect in its simplicity and balance.  But that bowl of soup was probably the highlight of the night.  I ordered sauteed duck confit which supposedly came \"with\" a salad, but this was more of like a big green salad, and not a particularly noteworthy one, with duck confit in it.  (I'm a dolt with the French language, so maybe the French on the menu accurately described this dish, but the English didn't quite do so.)  And the duck confit itself was flavorful enough but a little dried out.  The wife reported that her warm goat cheese salad was pretty underwhelming, and it sure looked like it, at least for a $12 salad.  She said pretty much the same about her sea bass, which was plenty good but well short of the best piece of fish or three she'd ever had.

Obviously, it's possible we didn't order well and that we missed out on the items that best represent L'Express.

A wine list that is largely French, with some reasonably priced bottles and a good number of selections by the glass.

Four stars, yes:  L'Express is good.  But I bet you can do a bit better in Montreal.  In fact, I suspect you can do a bit better just in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"L'express lived out to most of the expectations set by previous reviewers. We were able to get a table for early Sunday evening and the place was still relatively quiet. We were greeted with some of the best baguette bread and mustard/cornichons. We had the goat cheese salad, ravioli and the steak tartar. Even though it was obvious we were the non french speaking tourists, the waiters were very nice and helpful. The service was prompt and they gave us help with our young toddler. Sadly he was out of patience by the end of the dinner so we didn't have a chance to try the desserts (though we did take a walk up to suite 88 chocolatier for a decadent hot chocolate."}
{"text":"C'est magnifique!  An amazing authentic bistro with a family friendly atmosphere. Kids get crayons to draw on the paper on the table.  Menu is multi-lingual and staff is very accommodating.  Food was exceptional and the kids devoured their dishes .. beet salad, ravioli and spaghetti.  The kir royal and Malbec were lovely. The duck fois gois was great, the goat cheese salad was also quite nice.  Poached salmon was very well prepared and extremely flavorful. The grain fed chicken was amazing as well.  

We were lucky to get in without a reservation but we went in before 5pm on a Tuesday.  It filled up by 6pm and had clientele from around the world but also a fair share of locals. 

Worth the trip for a family looking to try something new and yet accessible."}
{"text":"Based commendation from friends, I was a little disappointed
First, there isn't a sign out front but the name is written in the sidewalk. that's ok.
A long bar and an equally long dining room. The tables are very close together. 
Menu is in French with a corresponding .list of explanations. They have an extensive wine list, many of the wine are exclusive to them.
Started with a warm goat salad, not exciting. For entrees, I had quail which was very good and my wife ordered the hangar steak, also very good.
The desserts were the best thing of the evening. We had the chocolate tarte, excellent and some very good profiteroles."}
{"text":"a truly fantastic dining experience! we read about this place on the nytimes and circled back with yelp before we made a reservation. this place is so darling and the food is scrumptious! the bread is good, but the butter is phenomenal! i think french butter in general is better than what we have in america. regardless, the steak frites dish was really perfect. the fries were salty, soft on the inside, and crunchy on the outside. the steak was super tasty and juicy. something about the way the outside of the steak was cooked so that it tasted almost a bit fried. i dont know that much about how they made this steak but i know it tasted good.

i wasnt keen on the bone marrow (im not a fan of that part in general) but my date loved it! and he got the duck confit which was on top of a bed of vegetables. he said the duck was cooked to perfection! the comforting french food, the half bottles of wine, the service, and the adorable french bistro ambiance makes this a highly recommended dining destination!"}
{"text":"A Montreal gem.

The cool thing about this French restaurant is that it really feels like a Parisian bistro, which many travelers are shocked to discover is NOT standard in Montreal.  Yes people, Montreal and Paris are on two very distant continents and no, Montrealers are not baguette toting Frenchmen.

But this place might have you fooled, if you want to continue thinking that you drove up from Boston to visit France.  Please leave your redsox hat at the door though: the place is chic. 

Hard to spot from the outside but the mirrors and lighting make the place feel lively and spacious, even though its slightly small.  The service seems to be very male dominated; L'express is not pulling the cheap trick of hiring hot waitresses to get you in the door like some other wannabe restaurants on the parallel St. Laurent strip.  No, no, just a bunch of professional dudes who do a great job and know that they serve at one of the best restaurants in Quebec.

The food is buttery, yummy and beautiful.  Its also a little grotesque to see octopus or bone marrow being served but I'll bet it tastes as good as their chicken in mustard sauce (which I suspend my vegetarianism to consume) or their salmon...

The desserts are also worth waiting for, with the traditional isle flotant, some great chocolate tortes and even a baba o rum that will have your boyfriend's dad drunk in a few bites---and chanting \"baba baba baba\" for the remainder of the meal.  

You must, must, must eat here if you are in town."}
{"text":"The food is solid, but as many others say, not great.  The prices are also a little high for what you get.  The service is relaxed and competent.  As an overall experience and a sum of its parts, I do greatly enjoy eating here, particularly when they are not crazy busy."}
{"text":"In Montreal, there is no shortage of wonderful eateries. Among the very best is L'express, serving up some of the city's tastiest French Bistro fare. It has become a destination that has yet to fail me and its array of savory options have left me hungry for more whenever I'm back in the states. It is a go-to for many, and a must for whenever I'm visiting.

Adorned on the walls are photos from another time, a vintage peek into the old days when the establishment first made its name. The ambiance is festive without feeling touristy, the service is bustling yet wickedly efficient, and the decor is as simple as the faux-hand written menu.

I'll just say it right now: Everything I've tried (so far) has been delightful. Granted I haven't had *everything* on the menu, the many things I have ordered were outstanding. Among the highlights for the appetizers include: quiche of the day (best is ham and cheese or broccoli and cheese), smoked Atlantic salmon, octopus + lentil salad vinegrette, the foie gras terrine, and of course, the bone marrow which was buttery, smooth, and sinfully delicious.

From the beef tartare to the duck confit salad, their main courses are A+ from top to bottom. The pot-au-feu, or French beef stew, is a lovely and is delicious when paired with a great wine (ask the waiter). Few folks could argue against the roasted quail over wild rice or their homemade raviolis. My favorite so far has been hanger steak drenched in shallot butter and frites, a downright foodgasmic journey through a series of palate pleasing textures and flavor that my poor writing could never fully capture. If there are picky eaters in the group, shoot for the classic croque monsieur, or as they call it on the English portion of the menu, grilled cheese with ham. Even that is damn good, with mini chunks of juicy ham, and a gootastic mess of cheese that would even make lactose intolerant folks salivate.

French fare, let alone the bistro kind rarely comes cheap. For the quality of some of the dishes noted above, the price merits the experience. And combined with all of the other indulging aspects of L'express, I can't recommend it enough with two thumbs up and post meal grins. You just have to experience it yourself.

Je'taime, L'express."}
{"text":"A classic French Bistro spot. Very authentic, in terms of ambiance and cuisine. Beyond exceptional quality hanger steak and mouthwatering shrimp risotto. Great wine selection. Attentive waiters. 
The only negative is that they never seem to have creme br√ªl√©e on the weekends! Hope that changes! Although their profiterole sufficed, it's not the same."}
{"text":"Great experience! I just got back from Montreal after a long weekend and this was my favorite restaurant there. 
We went there on Sunday night, around 9pm so we did not need reservation.
we were very impressed by the menu which contain so many yummy options; the server recommended the duck liver pate  - the best I've ever had, served with pickles and spicy Dijon mustard and this tasty tasty bread. its very reach so we couldn't finish it, but really wanted too.. 
I ordered once of special dishes - Cobia fish with vegetable.. I finished it all. ALL. I needed to resist my self from licking the plate :)
the waiter recommended one of the white wines that I wish I took a picture of.
and last - the service. the nicest waiter, attentive and helpful that really helped it to be such a great experience."}
{"text":"Really excellent food with some of the best steak frites I've had...ever. I'd recommend making a reservation. When we arrived for our 8 pm reservation on a Friday evening lots of people were waiting for a table. The service was excellent. Our water glasses were always filled, more of the delicious, complimentary bread was brought to us without us having to ask and the server answered all our questions thoroughly. He was even patient with us with as we practiced our French and helped us to learn some new vocabulary. :) Also, despite the fact that it was rather busy, we were never rushed to order or to finish our meal. I ordered a glass of Reisling which was fabulous (although it's a rather small pour). We really enjoyed the complimentary bread basket. They also provide a huge jar of cornichons (pickles) and mustard. I also had the goat cheese salad which was great, featuring four large portions of goat cheese and various greens including endives. As I said above, the steak frites was excellent with hot, fresh frites and a delciously flavored steak. The portion was more than adequate. For dessert I just had a truffe maison (small chocolate truffle). It was okay but nothing to rave about. My friend had the ile flottant which she enjoyed a lot. I'd highly recommend L'express for excellent food at rather reasonable prices and good service. Note that there is not huge sign outside (just the tiles on the ground outside) so if you are approaching by car, watch carefully for the street number."}
{"text":"We went here as so many people raved about it on yelp! Thought I was the luckiest person to score a table last minute at 5 in the evening. 
The bread was so \"average\" for a highly rated place! The octopus salad was ok. Quiche was good. Steak frites was average nothing to rave about. And the chicken breast was way over cooked! It was DRY and were it not for the mustard sauce it sat on it was tasteless! 
Seriously save your money and your selves! Go somewhere else! I don't understand what the hype is all about to the point that it's booked every night! People do you not know REAL good food (?) that you actually say this place is great?????!!? So sad, as this was our last night and I really wanted it to be a good meal!"}
{"text":"Perfect ! This is a \"must\" stop on any visit to Montreal.   The room is simple and elegant, the staff professional and efficient.    The manager  followed us out the door to make sure that he said thank you.  The wine recommendation was great ant the food perfect. 
 
     I had the quiche as an appetizer and  quickly realized why quiche was so popular in the 70s & early eighties .  I think that has become  \"cheez whized\" in the US but this is the real deal[ btw -- how do they make that crust?]   The steak was tender and cooked to perfection  and the fries were just like mother used to cook.

If you are going to Montreal it may be a good idea to make your reservation a week in advance."}
{"text":"Been there twice already and will definitely go again! My favorites are the shrimp risotto and their macaroon 
Both to die for!! I did try their maple ice cream dessert which was good, but not as great as the macaroon. The cr√®me brule with pistachio was a bit weird/unexpected combination but I still finished it 
Looking forward to try more stuff from their menu!"}
{"text":"One of the Montreal greats. I had high expectations of the place and it did not let me down. 

We ordered the bone marrow to start, and the steak et frites and liver for our entrees. The bone marrow was too oily for my taste (there was nothing added to cut through it), but still fun to scoop out and eat with crackers. The steak et frites were good, nothing too memorable though. However, the liver was delicious. I am usually not a fan because it tastes too much like iron, but this liver was creamy, hearty, and delicate all at once. 

The service was pretty good. Our waiter was friendly, but the older man that seats you was a but rude. 

Me: Hi, I'd like a table for two. 
Him very gruffly: Well do you have a reservation?! (It was nearly empty behind him because we went for an early lunch)"}
{"text":"An old Montreal classic, L'Express might be the most authentic Parisian bistro this side of the Atlantic. Imagine a long narrow space with classic checkerboard floor, stainless steel bar, tons of mirrors, hurried staff, packed tables, and most importantly, a jar of gherkin pickles on each table. Bright, loud, and bustling, don't come expecting a quiet romantic atmosphere, this a Parisian bistro, not the US version, damnit. And true to form, haute cuisine it is not - rather, emphasis is on hearty traditional French foods, impeccably executed. 

Although the food is unpretentious, service definitely comes with attitude. This is a proudly FRENCH Quebec restaurant, not English, and if you don't speak French you are nothing more than a tolerated vistor.  I can certainly distinguish my \"poulet\" from my \"moules\", but that basic knowledge doesn't take you very far when you are struggling to order \"mousse de foie de volaille aux pistaches\", whilst the waiter disdainfully looks on, glaring impatiently, visibly grimacing at the mangling of his precious language. 

Also, you might need some help distinguishing the finer points of the French menu beyond basic vocabulary (god forbid you ask  your waiter). So my suggestion is if you can, bring someone who knows their way around French cuisine and language to help ease the interactions. To his credit, our waiter was quite helpful when it came to wine recommendations. 

From the dishes we ordered, I'd recommend the bone marrow with sea salt, the lamb with potato gratin, duck confit, and the quintessential hangar steak with frites. For desserts, the very potent baba au rhum is recommended for only the very rum-friendly. The flourless chocolate cake, however, should be experienced by every man, woman, and child on this planet."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: 
Classic and French. This place knows who they are and confidently owns it. The food is 
authentically French, the service is five stars, and the ambiance was wonderful. Come here if you're looking for a place that isn't scrambling to get on trend and is comfortable and dedicated to its wonderful craft.

THE SPACE + SERVICE: 
No frills bistro style. The place is cozy and clean. It's lively and filled with conversation, but my boyfriend and I felt like we were the only diners in the space. The service was absolutely pristine -- our bread basket was never empty. Whenever we hit the last slice of bread, they'd swiftly come and switch out our basket. Our wine and water glasses were never left empty. They were prompt, polite, and gave excellent suggestions! 

THE FOOD: 
Chicken liver pate with pistachios/ So yummy and a generous serving to boot. They also gave us some mustard and an entire jar of yummy cornichons to eat with it. I dislike pickles but was converted after this. 

Quail with wild rice - perfectly cooked and generously portioned. I loved the presentation of it fanned out. Wild rice was cooked perfectly and salted well. I was stuffed after this but had to make space for :

Blueberry tart - we asked our waiter for recommendations. He suggested the chocolate mousse or one of their specials, the blueberry tart. We opted for the latter and it was wonderful! Rich crust and a filling that wasn't too sweet. A perfect ending to a great dinner. 

They have a huge wine list and some half bottles listed as well, which was appreciated. We split a half bottle which thankfully left us alert enough to enjoy the dinner. 

No pictures as their menu had a no phones icon on it ;)"}
{"text":"Awesome food but also a great atmosphere. I loved the shrimp risotto, but apparently the ravioli are amazing!"}
{"text":"On our first day in Montreal, my friend and I were lucky to snag a table at L'express, the venerable french bistro establishment.

As we walked in, I greeted the maitre' d in French but once he responded back, I smiled sheepishly and spoke in English asking for a table.  He said he will check and said we were lucky that there was a cancellation.

It was packed for lunch and mostly by older clientele and families.  We were given menus in English and as we pored over the menu, I immediately gravitated towards steak.  My friend chose the quail with wild rice.

While we waited for our main course, we had bread and butter to tide us over and the butter was exceptional

Then when the dishes were served; it was complete and utter perfection.  I asked that my steak would be medium rare and I had a side of aioli sauce to complement my fries.  My friend's dish was artfully presented and we shared our plates as it was our usual custom when we dine together.

Afterwards, we asked out waiter what he recommended for dessert and he explained a few but he said his favorite was apple pie.  He explained as the dish was prepared, the dessert was flipped over then baked.  We were intrigued and after some consultation we decided for the apple pie dessert and my friend ordered a coffee.

The apple pie dessert truly melted in your mouth.  The apple pies that I have eaten usually had clumps of apple and cinnamon that you could see but the pie melted in your mouth.

It was truly a heavenly meal and can't wait to come back to Montreal to try the rest of the menu"}
{"text":"There are many good things about L'Express and I wanted to give it 5 stars but you really have to pick and choose what you order off the menu.  Here's my thought process:

The bread basket was cold.  Ugh
.
The Bone Marrow app was fantastic.  I mean very fantastic.  I mean very fantastical.
The Steak & Frites was excellent.  Steak was perfect, too much frites for the day as we had poutine just earlier that day but still very good.
The Quail dish was also excellent.  I've never had such juicy tender quail.  Muah!

Shrimp Risotto was bleh.  So bleh.  It was cold.  It was a cold glob a goo.  What the hell happened here?  I can't believe we didn't send that back.  I'm still mad that we didn't send that back.  It was so gross.  I guess since I didn't order it I didn't want to embarrass the person who did order it but my goodness the shrimp risotto was so bad I wanted to puke.  i wanted to puke and I wasn't even the person who ordered it. 

Duck Confit Salad was soooo yummy.  This was my dish.  I'm not sure if there was even any dressing on the salad.  All I tasted was duck fat all over everything.  There were so many textures and flavors going on here that it made every bite an adventure.  I was really impressed and this is a big statement since I never order salad for dinner.  I am man.   

Oh, and avoid the shrimp risotto."}
{"text":"Our first meal in Montreal! We arrived on a Tuesday night so we walked right in without a wait. Cute place with a French bistro feel. We ordered the bone marrow appetizer, steak and fries, and the roasted quail. Bone marrow was good and perfect on the toast and sprinkled with sea salt. I loved the quail dish which was served over wild rice..which had excellent flavor, moist and perfectly cooked...the wild rice perfectly balanced out the quail.  The steak was also good and prepared quite well. I just wasn't blown away by it but it was good in its own rights. Waiters were attentive."}
{"text":"Now granted, I called day of for my reservation, but you know it has too be good when it gets 4.5 Yelp stars and they tell you that the earliest reservation they have available is 10p.

So we hit up a few places beforehand on the way to a good french meal. To start with, let's talk about the great French bread that they serve. It tastes just like the bread in France. None of that fake French bread that we often see in America, First course consisted of duck foie gras. The flavors were moist, rich, delicious. 

Entree consisted of shrimp risotto for the gf. She was a bit disappointed. Rice was a bit overdone and the shrimp were a bit tough. I had steak tartar. A rare treat that is normally not done that well in the states, so I took full advantage of the opportunity here. We also had a nice bottle of cote de Rhone wine. 

A mix of different tarts were given for dessert. Then to complete the meal, some digestifs consisting of a raspberry flavored \"eau de vie\" (water of life) and a $19 dollar glass of J. Walker Blue. For those of you who drink scotch, this is a great deal. 

The servers were very friendly here. Probably the most incredible part of the experience was that as we were leaving after midnight, this place was still serving people for dinner. The place was still full and new tables were still arriving. Incredible!"}
{"text":"A lazy lunch here with glasses of wine and rich French fare was delightful. The staff were wonderful - that perfect mix of efficient and kind service mixed with confidence rather than snooty-ness was really unexpected for what looked like such a traditional French bistro (hey, I'm not immune to bad stereotyping either okay?).

An absolute must when in this city."}
{"text":"Delicious steak frites in a classic bistro setting. My girlfriend and I visited on a crowded Thursday night without reservations but we were able to get a table in only a few minutes. 

The portions of steak were modest (I believe 8 oz) but filling, and they came with plenty of fries, cooked perfectly golden brown. The steak was also topped with a shallot butter which was delicious - definitely strong onion/shallot flavor which I thought complimented the cut of steak very well. Also served with dinner was a jar of mini pickles for the table which was a nice addition.

The host and our waiter were very polite and helpful. Great experience with delicious food and prompt service."}
{"text":"Great. Don't know what happened that our reservation was lost, so we were not seated and were a little frustrated with the wait, but we eventually sat at the bar and started ordering   Everything was fabulous Obviously, this place is famous for a reason I don't think there is a local or frequent visitor that doesn't know about it, but for good reason. The food is amazing and worth the wait. They're crazy busy and packed, but in the end, they accommodate and they deliver And that's what matters"}
{"text":"Best liver here! Great service and wine. They could work on better deserts but the mains were great"}
{"text":"So many reviews raved about their Burrata Tomato Salad so I had to try even though I would prefer to order something more French.  To my disappointment it tastes just like the Italian tomato salad with mozzarella cheese and basil that I made at home.  Nothing too special except the texture of the burrata cheese, a more soft creamy version of mozzarella cheese.  It still taste very good but I am just not \"wowed\" by the taste.  The presentation of this salad is very good so it will still be a good choice if you don't need to have classic French.  We also ordered their most famous bone marrow and it was not dry like some review said.  But I found ours too greasy.  Since we make osso buco at home this bone marrow was just ok.  But I have to give them credit for making this available because it is a tough job to cook bone marrow just right.  I did like my kidney main course--classic French taste.  I love the small plate so you don't need to bring the leftover home.  We ordered their cream br√ªl√©e because their best floating island was sold out.  It was really good, probably the best I have had in years.  I stopped ordering cream br√ªl√©e in the US because they were too eggy.  This one is perfect and with a pistachio twist.  Very nice.  Can't finish a French dinner without the cheese.  According to our next table who are a local regular customers I ordered the blue cheese because they said it is the best blue cheese in the world.  I have to admit it is worth it.  The taste is subtle, unlike many blue cheese, and you can taste lots of interesting things.  That makes it a true gem.  I also had their chocolate truffle, another well done.  I had to order a macaroon to try and remind myself why I never like it that much.  Although their macaroon was done perfectly I still think it is too sweet for me.  The wine we ordered also needs time to air.  It tasted better after 15 minutes.  I read some review about their wine and believe it could be their wine was not given enough time to air.  Their service was good also.  It was worth the experience after all."}
{"text":"Came here by recommendation of the hotel, as well as, many outside reviews claiming it to be the best french bistro in Montreal. It a small restaurant that can easily be missed if youre not looking carefully for it. The decor is very simple but the lighting makes it a very intimate setting. 

With a reservation, we were seated right away. Service was great and very helpful considering we couldnt speak/read french (they have an english menu available). There was bread, butter, and pickles to start. 

Bone Marrow was to die for. Literally! I swear my eyes were oozing fatty goodness by the time we were done eating it. Three huge bones served with croutons and sea salt. It was a magnificent appetizer! 

Duck Confit Salad - I think the duck was beautifully done. I was a bit disappointed in the salad itself however. It was DRENCHED in vinegar dressing. a bit overpowering for me, took away from the other flavors. 

Steak Frites - perfectly cooked and topped with an herb butter. it was really delicious. served with crisp fries. 

The experience/ambiance was a 4, but the food 3.5. Nothing too extraordinary, just classic, solid french food."}
{"text":"Like a few other Yelpers, I was disappointed with L'Express, after all the hype it had received.

The first thing that struck me about L'Express was how unfriendly the establishment appeared.  The Ma√Ætre d' appeared almost annoyed with us when we arrived and requested our reservation.  Without so much as a word, he left us standing in the reception for 25 minutes while he seated several parties who arrived after us.

Likewise our waiter was a man of few words and remained cold and detached from our entire dining process.  The only time he spoke during our interaction was in a harsh, condescending tone when we requesting a recommendation pairing wines.

The food itself was relatively unspectacular, neither very good nor very bad.  We had a goat cheese salad, mushroom soup, quail and lobster risotto.    I can't complain, but with all the great dining options in Montreal, I don't see any reason to come here again."}
{"text":"We had the hangar steak and ravioli, per the waiter's recommendations.  The ravioli is delicious, the hangar steak was just alright.  Seems like the dishes on the menu are good, it was our fault for not being a little more experimental with our choices.  Since there are so many other highly recommended restaurants in the area, I'm not sure I would make a point of going back to this one, but the ambiance is lovely and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"L'Express is the true type of French bistro that I wish we could find more here in the US.  They have, maybe, the best bread outside of Paris.  (Alas, you cannot buy this baguette as it is made specially for the restaurant, and sometimes the chef rejects it when not up to standards.)

It is a joy to eat here on vacation with my family, and to watch my 6-year-old daughter discover the joys of duck confit and frites with aioli.  The steak frites is delicious, but other specials have also proved memorable.  Seemingly, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu, and the prices are oh-so reasonable, too.

We are going back during our annual August trip to Montreal!"}
{"text":"L'Express Montreal is one for those Parisian French restaurants. I was on the hunt for the most traditional french cuisine I can find. I came across this French bistro called L'Express Montreal, and what stood out for me is I can have all my sinful french favorites in this traditional bistro.

I walked down a trendy street of Rue-Saint Denis after getting off the Sherbrooke Station. After a brief walk I realized I have passed the entrance of the restaurant. I walked back and when I opened the door, I realized that I should've booked a reservation. I find it hard to request for a table. Table for one please.


My first impression is how old times mannerisms are kept here. A lady patron that walked in before me gave the front of house manager a kiss on the cheek; one on each side, and then he proceeded to take her jacket to hang. I was lucky enough to get the very last corner seat at the bar (as hopeful patrons without reservations are told to wait at least 45 minutes.) Phew!
I sat down and before ordering they serve bread and butter. Since I already made up my mind I selected the following.

Boiled Egg with Mayonnaise (oeuf dur mayonnaise) 4.70: No thrills, a classic french snack starting with a boiled egg, covered in a coat of rich mayonnaise with strong hint of dill.

Bone Marrow with Coarse Salt (os √† moelle gros sel) 14.85: My goodness, for 15 bucks you get three generous servings of bone marrow. You are not going to break the spoon here trying to scrape for marrow. Guaranteed that you will get a rich portion every single time. The marrow is rich and heavy. It is more of a texture indulgence than taste.

To accompany this, they serve unlimited gherkins straight from the jar as a side snack to cut the richness. Sea salt and mustard to enhance the flavor. 

Warm Goat Cheese Salad (ch√®vre chaud) 13.35: How can you be in Montreal and not try their cheese. Warm goat cheese on brioche with a light green salad.

Chicken Liver Pate with Pistachios (Mousse de Foues de Volaille aux Pistaches) 14.75: To finally put you to sleep. We are writing this riding the subway back to the hotel, is this rich pate! Don't let the small size fool you. They are not holding back. Imagine spreading this over the top rich chicken liver pate on your bread over and over... and over again. The Pistachios is a classic accompaniment as it adds a different texture to the spread. I think I gained 10 lbs from this alone! But it was so worth it!

Overall, this is for someone that wants to experience traditional french bistro dishes. I would bet that they haven't changed a thing in this restaurant since the opening. And that is not a bad thing. Not at all!"}
{"text":"The scene: Monday night toward the end of Just For Laughs. 1:00 AM. My dining companion and I had resigned ourselves to getting wasted on The Distillerie's massive drinks and drunkenly scarfing down whatever was still open, abandoning all hope on finding a nice place open late on a Monday in Montreal. And then there was L'Express.

Happy to seat us at 1:00 AM (hot tip: their kitchen is open until 2:00!) service was incredibly polite and attentive. Like most folks in this French bistro, we started our meal off with some wine (an incredibly reasonable and tasty Cotes du Rhone, no less!), fresh, chewy bread, and a big jar of homemade pickles. Not much a pickle-eater-- and not even drunk enough to have strange cravings!-- I devoured these delights with dabs of mustard.

After perusing the menu in wonder, we settled on a warm goat cheese salad and the ever-famous foie gras terrine to start things off. The cheve chaud was a dream, lightly dressed in a homemade vinaigrette with spring greens, endive, and crispy toast points, all topped with the most velvety, tangy goat cheese. Better yet was the foie gras terrine-- buttery, smooth, slightly salty, fatty... oh, goodness. Even the buttered toast points were perfection.

We opted to share the roasted chicken breast in mustard sauce. Served with salty haricot verts, potatoes, and cherry tomatoes, the chicken breast itself was juicy, tender, and perfectly seasoned to complement the tangy dijon.

Both drunk on wine and foodie-joy, we lost all self control and ordered the chocolate tart. Buttery crust, rich chocolate ganache, bitter cocoa-- kind of the perfect end to an evening. 

During the taxi ride home, my dining companion and I were almost completely silent save for murmurs of, \"Whoa\" and \"That is easily up there in top ten meals of, uh, ever.\" 

Service, as mentioned prior, was outstanding. Although we were the last seated, both the bartender and waitress were incredibly accommodating, friendly, eager to make recommendations, and even endured our pitiful French pronunciations. Highlight of our trip, for sure."}
{"text":"An adorable French bistro, almost hidden due to no sign on the front. Quite small with friendly staff and delicious food!

We went around noon on a Friday afternoon, right when things picked up for lunch. 

All of our food showed attention to technique and tasted delicious. 

The bone marrow appetizers are very large, full marrow bones served with coarse salt, alongside their bread and butter. Very good.

The rillete was also delicious. I did not love the sorrel soup but others in the group did. They also serve a large jar of cornichon pickles that are so sour and tasty!

For entrees we had the calf liver (smelled amazing with the tarragon, cooked so gently, very nice) and the steak tartare (spicy, seasoned, mustardy, good!).

For dessert, the profiteroles were so perfect. The choux was cooked to a crisp outside and delicate inside, filled with maple ice cream. Not too sweet.

Our waitress was very friendly and accommodating; she brought crayons for the kids, pink lemonade, and saw to our needs often without words even being needed. 

Loved our meal and would return!"}
{"text":"L'Express has been around since 1980 and is the so-called hot-spot for breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, and late-night eats for the Montrealers.  Always being rated as one the places not to be missed, the hubs and I came here for brunch during the weekday to check them out.  We were greeted warmly and were seated promptly.  The menu is extensive, offering items such as quiche, breast of a grain-fed chicken, grilled salmon on a spinach bed, etc.  We started off with Hard-Boiled Egg with Mayonnaise (these 1.5 halved, hardboiled eggs (3 pieces total), covered with a curry-infused mayo-like sauce on top; it was definitely very curry-strong, but there wasn't any salt or any other seasoning to these).  For the entrees, the hubs had the Spaghetti with Mushrooms (spaghetti with a watered down marinara sauce, tons of sliced mushrooms (canned?), all on top of arugula - I thought that this dish was pretty unappetizing, as the marinara had no flavor to it, and the mushrooms were just way too strong in the dish); and, I had the Hangar Steak with a side of Frites (the steak itself was super tough, and the horseradish herbed butter on top was cold; it didn't melt onto the steak, since the steak itself was not hot and just lukewarm; a side of veal au jus was served (as an option), but this had too much of a game-like taste to it, so I was not a fan; the frites, however, were perfectly crispy and tasty).  Sliced bread, butter, as well as a ridiculous large jar of cornichons (seriously, this jar was massive!) with tongs was left on the table, as well as a jar of fresh hot mustard.  Service was great - attentive and efficient.  The vibe itself is relaxing and comfortable, and I like the pictures on the walls as well as the black-and-white checkered tile floors.  I'm glad I was able to check out L'Express out, but can't recommend!

{"text":"This is a five star restaurant for me because of the overall experience: the humble cozy exterior, the atmosphere and simple decoration inside, the servers, absence of annoying music and the smooth sound of people talking, the pickles, the food and the dessert. I just end up having a great time every time i go there.  I don't speak any french and most servers seem to prefer to speak in french. Nevertheless they are always kind, helpful and some of them have a fun pleasant sense of humor as well. They bring a jar of pickles to every table and leave it there for you to munch over. The food tastes great and the portions are what you'd expect of a french restaurant. I've tried the ravioli, the steak, the liver, the risotto... And a few of their desserts. My fav dessert so far is the white chocolate pistachio brulee :) it's a great place to treat a friend who's visiting, or just to catch up with an old friend over excellent food"}
{"text":"I do not understand how this restaurant receives such high ratings from Yelpers.

I was quite disappointed with this restaurant.  The service was great but the food was just bland and bordering on bad.  We got the bone marrow with coarse salt.  It was a good appetizer, I got the steak and frites with garlic butter.  We ordered the steak medium rare but it was really tough and not flavored very well, even with the garlic butter which didn't add much, tasted just like plain butter.  
 
I ordered the grilled salmon on a bed of spinach- do NOT order this.  It was just a piece of bland, not-high-quality piece of salmon, grilled, no seasoning whatsoever, just a pile of coarse salt on top which I presume you're supposed to spread on top, which I did and it was too salty.   The salmon was half-cooked, completely raw in the middle, and when I asked the server whether it was supposed to be cooked like that, he said yes, it's really your preference.  I never had such terrible tasting salmon at a restaurant.  It was placed on top of spinach that tasted like it was blanched in hot water, then pulled out and placed in a circle on the plate. 
 
I would give this place 2 stars for food, and 4 stars for service, but the food was SO underwhleming I have to settle for 2 stars."}
{"text":"Interesting food. If you don't make a reservation, you won't get served"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on Sunday. Very classic French bistro with retro vibes. My party ordered coffee first and that came in an instant. It was strong and good coffee per the crew. I ordered a tea. It never came and after 15 minutes I had to remind them. It came immediately. All good! The baguette bread it came with was so good and crunchy.  The fish soup was nice with a tomato base. Came with some cheese toasted bread. My croque Monsieur was amazing. The vegetarian dish was an omelette with cheese. All in all good service, friendly staff who didn't hesitate to explain the menu to us more than once, and great food! Hope to come back to have dinner here next time!"}
{"text":"I went there for my last dinner in Montreal, and had a wonderful experience. The staff was fantastic, the atmosphere was classic French bistro chic, and the food -- perfection. I had the steak with frites (why get anything else?) cooked medium rare. I find it's often difficult to find a well-cooked streak, but L'express cooks their dishes perfectly. For dessert, try the √Æle flottante. It's a French nursery dessert, a meringue topped with vanilla custard, and the presentation is a lovely end to your meal.

For what you get, it's an incredibly fairly priced restaurant -- you can get a glass of good wine for $5, for example, which I thought was quite cheap. The waiters also gave topped up my wine without asking which is always appreciated.

All in all, I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, wine and service. The bartender was extremely knowledgeable and gave great recommendations along the way on food and pairings. They encouraged us to take our time and order each course as we were ready for the next."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my brother and girlfriend on a quiet sunday afternoon. We had steak-frites, steak tartare and warm goat cheese. The food came out promptly but didn't really have that much flavor behind any of it. The exception to this are the giant jars of pickles served with fantastic dijon mustard.

the service was quick, polite and efficient. definitely express."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is one of those times that Yelp let me down. I was super excited about this place for having my first dinner in Montreal. 

Fish soup was tasty but too salty, 3 of us could not finish one octopus lentils appetizer since it felt like it was frozen for days, hanger steak was only okay, there was nothing special in French fries and the chocolate cake had too much cacao (I have to admit that we have been told about that by the waiter). Wine selection was pretty good though.

In a nutshell, none of what we ordered was \"great\" and you can easily find better places in NYC if you spend $300 for a party of 3."}
{"text":"I'm usually given the duty of picking out restaurants whenever my family and I are on vacation, so when my dad told us that he found the perfect place for our last meal in Montreal, we were all a little skeptical. We never should have doubted him, however, as he picked L'express and it was nothing short of amazing. 

From the second we walked in, it felt like we were transported back to France. What with the checkered black and white floor and the palm trees, L'express exemplifies the traditional Parisian bistro. And I absolutely loved it.

To start, we split the Duck Foie Gras Terrine and the Bone Marrow with Coarse Salt, both of which were delicious. This was my first time having bone marrow off the bone, so I quite enjoyed scooping it out and spreading it onto the toasted bread. Each table was also given a huge jar of brined pickles, which I had quite a few of along with the spicy dijon mustard. 

For my entree, I ordered the Homemade Raviolis, which our waiter informed me was a pork and veal blend served in a mushroom glaze. Being a huge fan of mushrooms, I was not disappointed. It was a tad bit salty, but good nonetheless. 

The rest of my family ordered the Steak Tartare, the Saut√©ed Duck Confit, and the Hanger Steak. They all thought everything was delicious, minus the steak tartare, which was slightly under seasoned. 

We ordered the Ile Flottante with Caramel and the Apple + Blueberries Crumble for dessert. None of us have ever had ile flottante before and were very pleased with it. Both the meringue and cr√®me anglaise were delicious and not too sweet. My favorite was the crumble though, as I love me some crumble. 

We all left the restaurant pleasantly happy and full. Most definitely letting dad pick out a restaurant again next time!"}
{"text":"First off... this is my 100th review!!!! I finally get to review my favorite restaurant!!

L'express... where do I begin.  Two years ago my family and I took a road trip to Canada. we went to Toronto, Quebec, and Montreal.  My dad as our guide (even though he's never been there before) we flew all the way to buffalo, NY and rented a car and drove all the way to the border of Canada (4 hrs).  Then drove another 4hrs to Quebec.  I must say, i have never sat in a car for that long.  The trip was definitely worth it. 

 I love everything about Montreal, the beautiful people, the language, the streets adorned with fallen leaves.  This is where i meet  the dainty yet cozy L'express.  My brother had heard about this place and just to make sure, we asked several people about the restaurant and they agreed...it was the best french restaurant in Montreal that wasn't overly overly priced!  There is nothing fancy about this place, just checkered black and white tiles running the floor, dark wooden tables and chairs, and huge vases of miniature pickles.  Not to mention, you will only find this place by looking down. The name of the restaurant is discreetly spelled out in black and white at the foot of the restaurant. This is french food, in my opinion, at its finest...comfortable yet flossy..... inexpensive yet lavish all at the same time.  

The menu is a rustic looking piece of paper, but with each dish spelled out in cursive as if someone used calligraphy to hand write each one.   For those of you who do not speak or read french, they have English menus.  Just ask!

The waiter explained the specials for the night in his french accent which i found very attractive =P  He suggested we start with the Magret Canard (thinly sliced smoked duck served with halved figs and drizzled in a red wine balsamic reduction).  It was heavenly. The duck reminded me of fine proscuitto yet so opposite.  The color was dark burgundy and the each peice was so dainty.  When paired with the fig and the reduction i was blown away!  I tried to savor each piece, but between the 4 of us, we each had only 2 small slices.   

My dad ordered the Parisian style steak frites w/ herbed butter.  For something so simple, it was one of the best steaks i have ever had.  When he cut into it, juices flowed out and we all knew it was going to be delicious.  The flavor of the buttered herbs and the meatiness of the beef drizzled in its own juices was so satisfying, not to mention the perfectly sliced and fried frites!  

I ordered the bone marrow of cow which was topped with grey salt, served with toasted baguettes.  It was so simple, and the bone marrow was fatty and had a jelly like texture to it.  The presentation of each dish is so simple, four bone marrows, a pinch of Grey salt and individually topped with a green leaf of some sort.  Definitely not saving the best for last because each dish was magnificent beyond words... is the veal kidney with cremini mushrooms and baby dutch potatoes.  I have never eaten kidney other than cooked in soy sauce and topped with green onions.  This dish was so humble yet it blew me away.  the veal kidney was cooked perfectly.  When you bit into it, it 'popped' so to speak, and it was tender on the inside.. not rubbery and overcooked at all.  It was nicely paired with the mushrooms and potatoes.  I'm not sure what was in the sauce, but it was divine... ahh..

to wrap up my long review... order some wine & do make reservations or prepare to wait 1..2..hours..even though its worth it!!"}
{"text":"We came to L'Express on the recommendation of our hotel concierge. We booked a trip a little bit too last minute to get a reservation at Joe Beef or Garde Manger (actually, the latter was closed the one night we had in Montr√©al anyhow).

We were not disappointed.

As I understand it, L'Express hasn't changed much over the many years it's been around. And it shouldn't. It has the feel of a classic Parisian bistro, a little tightly packed, a little noisy, but with an awe-inspiring wine list and a great menu of classics. I went for house-made Toulouse sausages, served with mashed potatoes and an incredible gravy, while Herself had steak frites.

Server made an unpretentious but excellent wine recommendation that fit both meals perfectly, and then for the most part left us alone, which frankly, is how it should be.

We wound up too full to consider dessert in the end, likely from the folly of a snack to tide us over until our 8pm reservation.

Don't neglect the pickles they bring to the table, they are amazing."}
{"text":"I had the warm goat cheese salad and the duck, both were fab. I even ate p√¢t√©, which I usually hate. I also tried my moms sea bass - everything was delicious."}
{"text":"The Lady and I have been coming to L'Express since our days at McGill. We always make it a point to eat here when we are visiting Montreal

Atmosphere:
- Classic French bistro
- Sat at the bar (which is the best experience for a party of 2)

Service: 
- Spectacular and friendly service
- Bar tender is running around serving the entire bar himself but he keeps on top of everyone
- Great by the glass wine recommendations

Food:
- For an app we got the octopus and lentals which was classic and hearty.  A nice dish
- Lady got the veal medallions which were very delicious served with a nice potato and spinach  
- I got the hanger steak and fries which is what I get 90% of the time we go there because it is done so nicely.  Comes with a generous serving of beautiful compound butter and nice crisp small fries that soak up all the butter and juice from the steak.  Cooked perfectly medium rare
- For desert we had the tart au chocolat which is exactly what you need to finish of this great meal
- We have also ordered the bone marrow in the past which is terrific and the qual which is really special
- Next time I want to try out the veal livers, quiche and the pot au feu 

Other:
- Prices are a little high but for the quality of the food, it's a great deal 
- Great vibe and a special place
- Recommend sitting at the bar"}
{"text":"Amazing, authentic French cuisine and great service! Loved the food and ambiance and energy!  Courteous service!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! It is the closest thing to an authentic Parisian restaurant. I love their black and white checkered floor. Their food is very good too. When you first sit down, they bring you a jar of gherkins and a sliced baguette - so good, it is addictive :) 
My favourite meal at this restaurant is definitely their Ravioli. 
Another great thing to now is that they are open for Late Night menu. You won't be stuck having a bad meal even at midnight!
My only draw back is in my personal opinion, there is a je-ne-sais-quoi missing from this restaurant in terms of ambiance. Otherwise, excellent!"}
{"text":"Went there fore lunch on a beautifully sunny day. First thing you notice walking in is the trademark black & white square tiles. Feels very French-bistro-y (for lack of better descriptive).

I was less than impressed with the food for the prices. Presentation was lacking, although quality was there. My favourite was the duck confit salad by far. Bone marrow was too much for one person, there were barely any escargots in my escargot dishes (would have been better renamed to escargot flavoured sauce), and the ravioli portion was too small... Otherwise, the octopus was amazing, lentils were okay.

Definitely try if you have time (and the money), some people love it and find it very authentic. For me, it just didn't do it.

{"text":"Came here recently as it was on my list of places to try when visiting Montreal. Called day of on Saturday and was able to get a table for 2 at 645pm.

We got served the complimentary bread and butter. Butter was cold, which made it terrible for spreading. I'm not sure why some restaurants don't provide room temp or whipped butter as it just comes off as cheap otherwise. 

We ordered the bone marrow, ravioli and hanger steak. The bone marrow was as expected and not bad. The ravioli was decent and had a interesting mushroom sauce. The steak was cooked well however the fries seemed fairly oily (puddle of oily at the bottom). 

Overall, I think the prices are above average for what you get and the experience is average at best. I feel like this is one of those restaurants that's been around a long time and is surviving due to its history vs the actual food quality."}
{"text":"Classic French bistro as fine, as wonderful as any found in Paris- don't miss the experience, the ambience, the food. The soups themselves are perfection- 
Put this one on your Montreal list- Ben Harper does."}
{"text":"I've been to this resto many years ago when I lived in Montreal so I decided to take my family for a French bistro dinner while I was in town. Since foie gras is banned in SF, we decided to get the foie gras terrine for $31 and thought it would be huge portion, it definitely wasn't $31 worth of foie gras. Aren't the foie from Quebec?! The oysters were teeny tiny, sea bass was very tender, beef tartare was just so-so, kidneys were tasty and duck steak was probably the best dish. The ambiance was loud and had a great french bistro feel, so overall pretty good food but overpriced for what you're getting. Unfortunately, don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Always worth a visit when in Montreal. Can be crowded and you might have to wait if no reservation but the food is authentic and the vibe is
good.
Stay with the traditional French dishes and enjoy yourself.
Alan/ New York"}
{"text":"Seriously excellent, I sat solo at the bar which was lovely. Enjoyed the quail w/ asparagus. Atmosphere is medium loud, was packed with a good looking crowd. Fantastic waiters.....jars of cornichons w/ bread for each table.....so awesome!"}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's Day. This is the second time I've  been to L'express. The bone marrow portion was extremely generous and the presentation of the octopus salad was an instagrammers dream. We ordered the calf liver and steak tartare. The calf liver was some of the best I've ever had and was cooked perfectly. We finished with  a chocolate tart and creme brule. The tart was decadent but not overpoweringly sweet. Great place for authentic french cuisine in Montreal."}
{"text":"Try the pork/veal ravioli, made with shallots. You will get a lot of bread."}
{"text":"This charming French bistro is right out of Paris, and the real Balthazar experience. Upon entering, one senses that they have entered a special and iconic place. Traveling alone, I made a reservation for the bar. I assumed that I would just be placed at the bar when there was an opening. I was wrong. I arrived to find a table setting for me, a place mat and a card saying \"reserved\" at the space designated for me at the bar. It was a special way to begin the meal. The bartenders and waiters were exactly what I would expect at a French restaurant, and very attentive. 

The soup came in a beautiful bowl and accompanied by cheese bread slices. I chose the steak frites for my entree. The meat was succulent, juicy and able to be cut with a fork. The fries were crunchy, salty and perfection. I normally don't order hanger steak and fries, but I'm so happy that I did. It's the best I've ever had or could hope to have again.

The wine list too is substantial and reasonable options exist. 

The prices are incredibly reasonable for such a nice experience, with most entrees in the $15 to $25 range."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 8:30 and the gentleman actually was able to take us early.  I am giving a 5 star review for the service and the spaghetti and mushroom. Yum!! The bread was cold but decent and my husbands got the steak and fries. Nothing special. That's where I had to drop it a star. Definitely a place to go to if you get the right thing. Very professional staff too."}
{"text":"Always a five star meal... year after year... had bone marrow, chicken pate, hanger steak, veal kidney, cheese tonight.  Everything was good as always but star of the night was the veal kidney!  It's not even a dish you see on menu in French restaurants in Ny... probably because either they can't source the ingredient or chef doesn't know how to prepare it right... here, not an issue!  

Compared to last night's dinner which was very good too, but the fact that I'm just as happy (and secretly a little happier tonight)... L'express is really a relatively bargain (halve the price of last night's dinner to be exact)"}
{"text":"This won in spades. Sophisticated bistro . Varied. Very intelligent wine/aperatif  list. Stellar dine at the bar service Fine fish soup 
with excellent alioli + croutons. Rognons a la  moutard approximate my own moose version. Tartare highly satisfactory ( still, read Robichon ) frites sucked - but so do they in most Parisian bistros these days,41/2 stars."}
{"text":"Went here last night and had a great meal and overall experience. Their goat cheese salad is amazing, and everything we ordered was good (croque monsieur, the kidney, country style soup, and the crumble for dessert). The waitstaff was extremely attentive without being overwhelming, and very kind despite the fact that we were a bit underdressed and slightly out of place (re: You'll feel better in a collared shirt and don't wear jeans). Best meal I've had in a long time and by far the best I've had in Montreal!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went for lunch at 1pm without reservation. The maitre d was efficient and sat us quickly. It was clean overall, narrow, and noisy from the end of the lunch crowd. Two of us ordered roasted quail with wild rice, one had duck confit with salad, and chicken. Don't order the iced tea for 4.50 each. There was no refills.The food was excellent but the service was slow and abrupt at times. Ginette warmed up with us after we complimented her on the photos we looked on the walls. The annual staff photos were framed and hung on the walls leading to the bathrooms. If you are not used to French attitudes, you might think they are a tad bit snooty. Otherwise, food is excellente and oh la la. Good job! Keep up with the quality of the food service!"}
{"text":"The brunch here is FABULOUS!

I came here for breakfast with a friend who's a local on a weekend trip to Montreal, and I felt like I was whisked across the pond and in Paris.  The ambiance was classy and casual.  Very clean and chic.  The aesthetics were like a Parisienne cafe in the 1920's.  The food was delicious and perfectly portioned.  We left feeling full and content, but not 'stuffed' or bloated.

I ordered eggs and a baguette and my friend ordered a quiche.  I ordered a cappuccino and he ordered an expresso.  Everything was delish!  I also found that the menu was very reasonably priced, and I would vote this restaurant as 2 $$ and not 3 $$$, as currently listed on Yelp.

Our servers were so friendly and knowledgeable of the menu.  It was clear they were very proud of the food they served and happy to help us.  I'm an American and an Anglophone, but I felt very respected here, and the servers even made attempts to speak with me in English.  I spoke to them exclusively in French, but I appreciated their understanding and incredible hospitality.  It made dining here a memorable experience.  I would love to go back."}
{"text":"Very good French restaurant, definitely improved over the last few years.
We got the beef tartar and home made ravioli. Both were amazing. The ravioli was thick and flavourful whereas the tartar was super fresh and well seasoned as well. You must order a wine to elevate the flavours?
The service was slow though."}
{"text":"I loved this place.  Its in a great neighborhood that we didn't get a chance to really explore.  I got a Greenwich Village vibe from it.  The service started a little snotty but then became really helpful and friendly.  I loved the art deco ambiance inside.
As someone from Chicago I'm used to restaurants, especially on a Sunday, to shut down by 11 pm.  Not this one!  We left well past 11 and they were still seating people for dinner!  
I think I may have filled up on pickles and bread though.. both are very good (esp the butter)
We started with the octopus and lentil salad which was maybe the best dish of the whole weekend.  Top 3 at least.  I had the shrimp risotto and it had a wonderful flavor.  The rice may have been a little over done/mushy but the shrimps and the sauce made up for that!  My friend go the steak and said it was just ok.  I think the meat was a little tough.  
Then we received some dessert wine from the house as a thank you for moving our table so they could accommodate a big party.  We had their signature floating meringue with it.  OMG it was like nothing I've ever had!  Really good but I was really full!  
I think the best part of this restaurant is the people watching.  It was like Mulberry Street!  I'd be back if I'm ever in Montreal again."}
{"text":"Tout est parfait: le service, la cuisine, la d√©co. C'est un classique et pas pour rien. Belle s√©lection de vins au verre. Mes plats pr√©f√©r√©s: os √† la moelle, mousse de foie de volaille, ravioli, spaghetti aux champignons, onglet de b¬úuf et frites. Et comme dessert: tatin aux pommes √† la mode."}
{"text":"So good. Roasted Beet salad, roasted quail, reasonably priced bottles of wine, and to die for desserts. Go!"}
{"text":"From the huge wooden bar to the black and white checkered floor to the old fashioned wine glasses, this place is so much fun and retro BUT doesn't sacrifice on flavor. It's just great french fare in a throw-back environment that won't cost you an arm and a leg. It's certainly not the best resto in Montreal, but with french bistros costing you a dime a dozen here, this one's by far the most worth it. 

The crowd is fun, the wait staff is quick and friendly, and the steak frites is just as it should be: crispy golden fries next to buttery pan-seared bavette. I also really loved the jar of gherkins and the bowl of dijon they leave on the table. Apparently, this is very french. Other things I've had-- the lamb, the mushroom ravioli- is just good. The presentation was a bit 80s and the portions were small, but both were tasty. L'Express also has baba au rhum for dessert-- but it sells out, so go early! Reservations are a good idea."}
{"text":"Excellent! Not sure if this L'express or the one in Manhattan came first but they are both delightful. I was so glad to be able to get a 7:30 reservation here.  The smoked salmon appetizer with capers and onions was wonderful as well as was the quail and shrimp risotto. The wait staff was extremely attentive but not overbearing which is a hard balance to hit. I was pleased to note that although they are known for their wines that they also had beers on tap. I appreciated that the menu was translated into several languages. I would love to come back here when we return to Montreal"}
{"text":"Amazing, amazingly authentic French cuisine and great service! Loved the food and ambience and energy! Bon apetit!"}
{"text":"Having never been to exposed to Montreal French dining, I wasn't sure what to expect.  The place looks like a small diner with linoleum floors and for all we knew, our waiter might have been proctoring a algebra quiz while taking our order.  My girlfriend doesn't normally enjoy salad but she sure enjoyed the warm duck salad, so much so she would not stop raving about it.  I don't really crave foie gras but it was tasty and served like a thin slice of butter with toasted sliced baguettes.  

Without realizing it, I had ordered the foie gras appetizer as a main and had to order another main course, or I would have been eating bread and liver for dinner.  Quail over wild rice was my last dish and it was served with a sweet red wine reduction.  For me, it was a learning experience in French food.  

The food wasn't amazing, it was good.  Of note, the bone marrow was ordered by two people at the table next to us and neither person seemed to really enjoy it.  One guy actually voiced his displeasure to the waiter when the check came around saying, \"this was not what I expected\", so take that for what its worth."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere! If you like tradition style French cuisine, L'express definitely is a good choice!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants.  We were in Montreal for the weekend and went to grab some drinks at a local establishment.  While there we asked the bartenders what they thought was the best food in Montreal.  They both agreed that L'express was the spot to go.  So we took our chances and headed over on a Saturday night, no reservations.  Apparently we got super lucky, since most people say you need to book well in advance.  We got a table in 5 minutes and then the unbelievable experience began.

The waiter was so nice and explained everything well.  We got the pate and the steak tartar per the bartenders recommendations.  I absolutely hate pate and have tried several different kinds., However, my husband loves it and he made me try this one.  It was incredible.  I didn't want to stop eating it.  The steak tartar was equally as good.  It was by far the best pate and tartar we've eaten.

For my main dish i got the lobster risotto which was delicious.  By the end of the night we were both thoroughly satisfied and agreed that we completely lucked out by meeting those bartenders (Baldwin Barmacie, check them out for some good cocktails!).  Cannot wait to go back to L'express!"}
{"text":"We had been walking up and down St. Denis all afternoon, during a brief vacation in Montreal.  Realizing L'Express was nearby, we stopped by in the early evening on a weekday and were able to get a seat at the bar, without a reservation.  The restaurant was beautifully lit, with a black and white tiled floor.  Since we were a little tired and weren't experiencing the whole sit-down fancy experience, we kept our food orders pretty light, not too rich.

I ordered the delicious steak tartare, dressed with sea salt and capers, with fries and lemony hollandaise on the side. i had been wanting to try steak tartare for the longest time, since it is not a common (or trust-worthy) item to order from even upscale Indiana restaurants.  My dining partner ordered the hangar steak medium-rare and fries (or frites...whatever), and really enjoyed it.  A jar of gherkins was in arms-reach on the bar; a nice touch, especially for us pickle lovers. The bartender was our main service contact; he was pleasant and attentive, without invading our privacy or pressuring us to hurry up (even as the restaurant filled up).  

Overall, I got to try something on my foodie wish list (steak tartare!) and we got to experience L'Express at the last minute, without a reservation...you couldn't wish for more, given our lack of planning.  I think if I got to try out the whole normal sit-down experience, going all out with wine, appetizers, and whatnot, that L'Express would definitely be a 5-star visit."}
{"text":"pot au feu... two bites of leathery beef, a grey tasteless boiled chicken leg, a piece of cabbage, two carrots and bone marrow.  other than the bone marrow, i pretty much make a better dinner than this by opening a can of Cambell's Chunky Soup for 2bucks at home.  this is about the experience of eating a rustic dish, but jeez, that was a joke.  wish i had tried the steak frites.  my friend had the steak tartare which was good, but not miles above any other steak tartare he's had at good restaurants."}
{"text":"We were recommended this place from a work friend. 

The establishment was decent with a vintage vibe. The menu had all the choices you'd expect with a couple of fish options. A couple of chicken and a few off the cuff type like calf liver and veal kidney. 

The wine list was quite vast with a wide range of price points. We chose a 60$ Riesling bottle which was a good tasting wine. But they thought is was acceptable to serve at room temperature expecting us to enjoy a first glass semi warm while we waited for it to chill in the bucket of ice. 

The other issue we had with our experience is with a entr√©e price of 25$-30$ it was sub par quality. It looked like something that could be made at home with a sloppy presentation. Average flavour. I had the sea bass and my wife the lobster risotto. 

The dessert we asked what they recommended, which was the apple tart. When we dove into it, it seemed like a piece that was left uncovered in the back of fridge for a week or two. The apples were this weird dark jelly on top and then more standard underneath. Flavour nothing special.

I wouldn't recommend this from our experience."}
{"text":"L'Express, for me, is just another restaurant in Montreal that let me down. I'm seriously beginning to question the dining scene up there. L'Express is a proper bistro complete with bare essential service. We also waited 40 minutes beyond our reservation time. Trust me the free beer was not worth waiting 40 minutes. 

The food was only worthy of two stars. Salad was just a salad. Terrine of foie gras was nice but not worth 30 CAD. (Why on every menu in Canada is foie gras so expensive? I find it much for expensive than anywhere I've been the USA.). Veal cheek casserole was nice but nothing special. The risotto could have used more protein in it. Lamb was OK. Just nothing popped out as being above average. However, the bread was awesome. 

No need for me to come back here."}
{"text":"Bless this place for being open late AND for being delicious, as the two rarely go hand in hand. 

Our flight to Montreal had arrived around midnight and we were starving. Luckily I had a whole list of Montreal bistros that I had researched before arriving, and this one was not only just down the street from our hotel but was also listed as being open until 2am. We never would have found it it without the address, since there's no sign other than the lettering on the sidewalk tiles. I thought it might be a problem that we were coming in so late and ordering so much food, but our service was absolutely fantastic. When 2am rolled around, our server told us there was no rush, that in fact only the kitchen closed at 2 but actually they were open until 3am, so we could take our time.  

Now onto the food, which was so good we ended up coming here again a few days later to try some more. We started off with appetizers of bone marrow, chicken liver p√¢t√©, and an octopus lentil salad. Not to mention that the table came with a big jar of cornichons and mustard. Everything was great, but I think we all really liked the octopus lentil salad the best. Next up, we had hangar steak w/shallot butter & frites, steak tartare, and a duck confit salad. Again, everything was delicious, and the steak was cooked perfectly. They had a very good wine list, so we had a couple good bottles to go with all of that. Finally, we closed with a plate of local Qu√©bec cheeses (one raw blue cowmilk cheese, and one raw sheepsmilk cheese), which we had accompanied by honey and a 1/2 bottle of Juran√ßon dessert wine, and espresso. We loved our food and the way they took care of us so well. 

We went again for lunch a few days later, and it was extremely crowded, but they managed to find a spot for us although we didn't have reservations. We repeated a few dishes from before, but we also this time tried a goat cheese salad, the rillettes, the roasted quail and the sole dor√©. My quail was so meaty and tender, and it had a nice honey glaze, and Mike's fish was excellent. For dessert we got their famous √Æle flottante (a big scoop of meringue coated with hardened sugar) and a parfait. Service was once again excellent, impressive considering how busy it was.

Over all, we were very pleased with the food and service coming from such a humble place. I think that's the challenge of French bistro cooking, to do simple food very well, and L'Express manages this marvelously."}
{"text":"LOVED IT!! Really nice, courteous, accommodating staff. We came in on a recommendation from a friend, around 8:30 on Saturday night, without a reservation, and the staff did their best to accommodate us. The food was delicious, the service wonderful, we were thrilled! I should mention that we, as a group, are not easily impressed, we dine out a lot, and are fortunate enough to live in cities that offer fantastic food and restaurants. L'express was the dining highlight of our vacation! Thank you L'express! Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Montreal and am already planning my next visit so I can return to L'express. I loved the complimentary pickle jar, couldn't stop eating them. For meals between the two of us we had salmon tartare and goat cheese salad for apps, the quail and duck confit for entrees, Sancerre wine and were too full for dessert. Every single thing was incredible. I am not a duck or quail type of girl (swearing the night before I wouldn't try either) and I loved both dishes. Definitely a must visit for some delicious French food."}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal from Boston. Made a reservation at L'Express for Easter Sunday breakfast (11:15am) as they were completely booked for brunch. When we arrived we were promptly seated at a nice table for 2. Shortly thereafter a waiter took our drink order but it took quite sometime for our drinks (mimosa w/champagne $$$$) to be delivered by another server. Then another new server came over to answer our questions (the menu is only in French and we only speak English) and take our order. We were then surprised to hear our first server, the one that took our drink order tell, the table behind us the specials which we were never informed or. Our breakfast came out quickly and was decent (omelette and quiche) but the service was awful. No one ever came back to check on us, so we weren't able to order additional drinks when we wanted to. And we had to flag someone down for the check, well past the time we wanted to leave. Looking around the restaurant it seemed like we were the only ones receiving this horrible service - I assume because we were the only English speaking Americans. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Montreal from the US for that reason."}
{"text":"I had a shrimp risotto and my partner had a 'canard saut√©'  with salad. It was all excellent"}
{"text":"I think I expected just a little bit too much here. In terms of French authenticity, this restaurant has met my expectations. Unfortunately the portions I got lacked considering the price.

The octopus and lentil salad was good, however I wanted more octopus and less lentils. Good thing my friends liked lentils so they finished that instead. The bone marrow was probably one of my favs.

The hanger steak was good, but the tartare steak was a disappointment; it just tasted like just any other steak.

Service was also a hit and miss. It took about 10 minutes for someone to finally come over (and that's after we waved someone over...I know, disrespectful on my end) to take our order.

Again, considering the price we paid, I probably won't go back. I think 3 stars is a bit too generous, only because I do like French cuisines and I can't complain about the environment overall."}
{"text":"We had a hard time finding places to eat in Montreal due to lack of Yelp users there.  We did find this restaurant, though, and it was absolutely fantastic.  Some of the most flavorful food I have ever had.  I wanted to order seconds (I got the ravioli).  It was amazing."}
{"text":"excellent food, great service, authentic french bistro atmosphere and reasonable prices. we had the oysters, fish soup, steak frites, that floating iles dessert and everything was perfect. our server pascale was charming and professional - perfect meal. we will be coming back for sure. merci l'express."}
{"text":"French bistro - classic dishes, nothing nouvelle or molecular, thank god. Excellent celeri remoulade and foie de veau √† l'estragon. Service friendly and professional. Cheaper than flying to Paris."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the atmosphere, especially sitting at the counter rather than at a table. Just wished the food was more enjoyable. Also got the impression that as non-French speakers and as tourists as contrasted with apparent regulars, we were treated in inferior manner by our service person. Too bad given the ambience and history."}
{"text":"Did not meet expecations. Too pricey for the quality you get. Cocktails were watered down, sea bass was over-oiled. Pickles and mustard were the best thing there."}
{"text":"The only reservations that were available on Saturday night were at 10pm and we were lucky to get them. When we left 2+ hours later, people were still being seated for dinner!

A very affordable bistro that is really easy to miss if you are not paying attention as it is not very well signposted.

The foix gras was incredible, the steak frites probably one of the best I've ever had and the creme caramel a l'orange was exquisite. 

Service was friendly and efficient and I even learned that rare is saignant in French."}
{"text":"My friend took me there for the first time 4.5 years ago, and I remember my experience there quite pleasant.  My friend had the foie gras, and it went very well with bread.

4.5 years later, I find myself back at L'Express again, and my 2nd experience remained pleasant.  We didn't have reservations, so we did have to wait 45 minutes to get a table (we walked around rue St. Denis, so no problem).  The decor is reminiscent of an European (presumably French, duh?) bistro:  very brightly lit and simple tables with a giant mirror.  

The food was decent.  I love the little pickles they provide in the jar.  I got the octopus with lentil salad.  The plating was very interesting (octopus packed like a can with the lentils inside), and the salad was tasty.  My friend got the warm goat cheese salad that she said was delicious, and another friend got grilled salmon with spinach which the salmon was big.  We then got 3 desserts that were all very tasty and light to eat:  apple/pear pudding, the orange 'flan,' and a chocolate mousse cake.  My small concern about this place is the service is a little slow and we did have to wait a while to get a table.

So I can say that in that 4.5 years span, L'Express remains consistent with the quality of the food (and unfortunately with the wait as well)."}
{"text":"For me, it doesn't get better than this! Classy Parisian style bistro with excellent service and a great atmosphere. 

We were in town for a boys trip; I am glad I had the foresight to make a reservation as it looked like it would be tough to get a table for 4 on a Friday night.

3 of us had the hanger steak + frites while 1 friend went for the sea bass. We were all very happy with our meals - the steak was cooked perfectly and the shallot butter was a tasty addition to the dish. They have a very extensive wine list - from $35 to $750/bottle - with some good options for those of us who don't need to spend $750 a bottle. Go here!"}
{"text":"A French Bistro serving a variety of traditional fair at moderate prices, L'express provides the full french/Montreal experience. Although the calf liver dish was just OK, the bread, pickles and wine list were truly a wonderful component of the dinner. A special mention on their wine list is worth noting. Prices on wines were fair and selection was excellent. I especially enjoyed their fortified wine selections! Great service where servers came across knowledgeable, engaging and humble.

Enjoy Montreal!"}
{"text":"Duck was dry and tasted terrible. Foia gras was stale. Service was slow.

Overall a pretty terrible experience, especially given the price."}
{"text":"It was hard to find even with google map but it was so worth the trouble!  Everything was delicious and my vodka martini was perfect!  And I had best bone marrow dish.  I should stop try elsewhere to avoid disappointment.  Wishing I didn't live thousands of miles away..."}
{"text":"Reservation is highly recommended. But we ended up walking in without one because we wanted some good French food. The host was kind enough to improvise a table for us after a 15-20 min wait. This restaurant is more upscale in terms of service and food. They offer really authentic french food. We had the bone marrow, squid salad and steak tar-tar. All of which was amazing. I would def re-visit when back in Montreal."}
{"text":"We're so glad that we made our way to dine here on our last night in Montreal. The restaurant is small and had a French bistro feel, very cute. 

Check out my video experience https://youtu.be/_01G91sSeSU

We came on a Monday evening around 6, without a reservation, thankfully, we were there early enough to snag a table before the reservation crowds started coming in. I guess, people in Montreal dine later in the evening, similar to the French counterparts :). 

The service was friendly but very laid back, they gave us lots of time browsing through the menu. The menu was in French but they also have English menu (though there was no price list on the English version but you can compare it to the French version to know the prices). The specials were only in French but the waiter was very gracious to translate and explain them to us.

Upon sitting down, we were served baguette with butter and a jar of delicious fresh pickles with hot mustard!!! Yummmmm!!! What a great palate cleanser! So good, we had to constantly remind ourselves not to overstuff our stomach with these goodies!

We ordered the Borsch soup special and the beet salad as appetizers. Both items came out very fast. The beet salad was very pretty!!!! Colorful, fresh and oooo sooooo yummy!!!! It was one of the best salad I've ever had! Not overly dressed, just perfection! The soup had small chunks of beets, beef, carrots, cabbage and I think potatoes, topped with creme fresh...oh my!!!! It was soooooo good! It was Perfectly seasoned, hearty, a great comforting dish on such a cold day!

For the main course we ordered the pot-au-vou (stew with beef, chicken and vegetables)and quail with wild rice. Again beautifully plated and the Quail was out of this world!!! Crispy skin, perfectly seasoned, juicy, not overcooked! Delicious!!!! Certainly a dish that I would forever cherish as my last dinner in Montreal. The pot-au-vou though, was a surprise....I've had a dish with similar name, but it was cooked in some type of wine broth, similar to American pot roast. This was boiled everything in clear broth. Beautifully plated but you basically had to season the plate yourself (they gave a small jar of salt). I guess, if you want something light, this would be the kind of dish for you. The bone marrow though, was yummy! I spread the marrow on a slice of baguette, sprinkled with a bit of salt and voila, marvelous!

For dessert we shared their famous \"floating island.\" We didn't know what to expect, but oh boy, that was one large dessert! Certainly could be easily shared with 2 other people! (Even more if you have smaller stomach and not much into sweet stuff). It's basically a meringue coated in caramelized sugar floating on custard sauce with almond pralines ... WOW! It was good but personally, not something I would order again...too big too (n i usually never complain about size! Lol) ...my hubby loved it though. Btw, if you have bad teeth, this is not a good dessert for you...lots of chewing the sugar and pralines..

Our bill with coke as drinks, came put to 95 CAD. Not the cheapest meal but great quality food that worth raving and coming back for. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Brunch/breakfast menu is only until noon! 

Was expecting to get a late brunch with my friend but learned that it was only available until noon. 

We took the croque monsieur and quiche du jour; the only 2 items on the menu that seemed more adequate for brunch.

Wasn't expecting much from the quiche but oh god was it good! !! The egg was creamy and chess. ..packed with flavor.  Definitely the best quiche I've ever eaten. Also tried my friend's crowd monsieur and it was also excellent.

Definitely will be back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"This is a lovely restaurant. I'm giving it four stars because the service was excellent and for the most part, the food was tasty. We started with a warm goat cheese salad (delicious). For dinner, my husband got poached salmon with chervil mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were fantastic and the fish was good enough. My main (chicken with a mustard sauce) was perhaps not the best selection ... the chicken itself was a little overcooked/tough. I was expecting a quarter chicken but instead I got a very thick breast (which probably explains why it ended up tough). For dessert, we had a maple tartine, which was delicate, flavorful and not overly sweet. I'd definitely recommend giving L'Express a try. Our waiter was fairly honest when we asked for suggestions, so perhaps this is the way to go."}
{"text":"Boy oh boy, if a genie had given me the choice of \"eat at a variety restaurants while in Montreal but not at L'Express or eat only at L'Express\" I would have gladly accepted the sole L'Express experience, no DOUBT! :)

L'Express is in the St.Denis neighborhood which is the coolest part of Montreal, if you ask me (and I guess by reading this review, you kinda are). The restaurant is the shape of a train cart almost, with mostly small 2 person tables. The crowd is local and diverse: we sat near an old priss-and-proper couple sharing a romantic meal, napkins tucked into collar and all. we also bordered a pair of hip gay guys with asymetrical hair-dews and sexy auras. I'd recommend dressing up a bit, but if you aren't, it's not pretentious. Also, it is open until VERY late, which totally fits my style. We saw people mozy in at midnight, welcomed to a full menu! If you going to get wine, I recommend the half bottle, it's very 'Montreal' to do, and a bit cheaper.

As far as food recommendations, the ***bone marrow*** dish had me considering cannibalism for months afterward, every passing human reminded me of the fatty guk that I had dug out of those luscious bones! It comes with these really crunchy pieces of toast that combine perfectly with the marrow's texture. While the sea salt seemed like a good idea to sprinkle on at first, I soon realized that it overpowered the bone marrow which is perfectly fine on its own, so keep that in mind.

What I love about this place is the subtlety of its facade. There is no sign directly on it but instead its name is on the ground in the black and white tiles right before you enter. (See the picture I posted) This is one of those reviews I write hoping secretly that no one will read it, since I do want this gem to remain a gem, but if you love that French bistro feel and you don't mind forking over the extra $ for the ride, then you really should hurry over and enjoy it!"}
{"text":"The one place on Montreal trip we felt like were out of the US.  It was great! Such a friendly bartender.  We ate at the bar since to avoid long table wait.  Great (and v. loud) atmosphere.
Steak Frites so much better than any in NYC.  Great bread and soup.  Would return!"}
{"text":"We were on vacation in Montreal for a day and was walking around the area. Dropped by for a late, casual lunch on a Friday afternoon and found it pretty packed and had to wait 10 minutes to be seated. We sat in the front of the restaurant, but the back room looked cuter and had a sun roof and was less loud. We got the pork special appetizer, which came with the jar of tiny pickles. Delicious! Also got the celery remoulade - surprisingly refreshing. For the main we ordered the mushroom spaghetti and another special containing three different types of meat (sausage, pork, and a chicken drumstick) over a bed of seasoned beans and vegetable. The pasta was very tasty but the other entree was nothing too special. Waiter service was average as well. If you're looking for a casual lunch spot, it's a pretty quaint restaurant."}
{"text":"The first night I was in Montreal, I was ripped off by a restaurant pretending to be French. The second night there, I confused Montreal with Paris, due to a perfect French restaurant named L'Express. We didn't make reservations,  but this was not a problem. We walked in on a Sunday night and immediately got a seat at the bar. Perfection. The service was precise and the experience was unique. When we were seated, a jar of mini pickles and mustard that is akin to wasabi was set before us. I consumed a quarter of the jar and ate half a loaf of bread before I even placed my app order, not because service was slow, but because they were so tasty I could only inhale them. 

For an app, we had the bone marrow. The stuff looks horrid, but wow. It is served with very crisp toast and sea salt. Eat it all together and the dish is irresistible. Pure fat, but so light that it just melts away with each bite. For my main course I had the Steak and Frites (fries). Ordered it cooked medium and it was done perfectly (my dinner mate ordered hers blue and it was by all means still moo'ing). So juicy with just the right amount of redness. The seasoned juice from the steak was absorbed by some of my fries. I ate them all. All. Did I lose a touch of my dignity when they removed my plate and you couldn't actually tell what was served on it because I cleaned it so well? Perhaps. But was it worth it? Very much so. I will say that having the bone marrow and the steak was a bit much. My mouth tasted as though I had coated it with fat. Totally my fault for over doing it, but I couldn't resist. It was just that good. 

My dinner mate suggested I skip dessert and just have an apple back at our b&b. This seemed so wrong. So wrong. I went on and ordered the Chocolate Tart for dessert to help cleanse my palate. This was a let down. Not as ah-mazing as some have described it to be. A little too dense for my liking. But all in all, L'express was a perfect meal that set us back about $100 Canadian for an app, two steak dinners, two beers and a dessert."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant in Montreal. The service was very good, and the food was amazing.  The price is also somewhat cheap compared to what you are getting.  
 
We had made a reservation as we had a group of 6, and it was good that we did. It was pretty busy all evening.  We ordered a few different drinks, they had a number of nice wines, good mixed drinks and good beers on tap.  

For apps, we had the smoked salmon, the bone marrow and a salad. The bone marrow was amazing. 

We had a few different dinner dishes, the hanger steak, beef tartar, a fish dish.

The beef tartar and steak frites were amazing, easily the best we had all weekend.

This place is a must!"}
{"text":"The way I review it is if you are better value for money in all criteria, then you have 5 star. If you are value for money but good or really good - 4 stars, if you are A-OK then A-OK.

This was a solid 5 Star experience

5 star
Everything from food service to decor. Simple stuff but super tasty. We had the Octopus and lentil salad and the Grilled Salmon. 

Both super yummy. Simple but tasty ingredients. Authentic French cuisine. Great mustard and pickles."}
{"text":"Amazing French cuisine restaurant! Everything tastes delicious. I highly recommend coming very hungry because you'll feel very guilty not finishing everything. Please also order the floating dessert. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Classic basic French bistro. Downside was that lunch menu doesn't start until 11:30AM on weekends, so ordering at 11:15AM means your choices are mostly just bread and eggs. Granted, they are impeccably prepared eggs, like everyone else here... and the bread is scrumptious (I'm told; I'm gluten-free)... but wish the full menu were available all day."}
{"text":"There is no sign, like any true great French bistro. The minute you step into the restaurant it is as if you are transported to Paris of the 1920's. The decor is classic bistro with dim lighting and old world feel. The waiters wear vests and clean white aprons and greet everyone with warmth. You just know you are going to be taken care of. 

Everyone's food at the table looked delicious, but I wasn't able to take a bit before their dishes were already half finished, so I can only comment on my own food. I had the shrimp risotto. This is not exactly French, but the French version of an Italian classic. The risotto was perfectly cooked with just enough bite to the rice to not make you feel like you are eating baby food. The shrimp were delicious and fit the saffron infused rice perfectly. 

As for dessert, I was able to sneak more than one bite off of everyone else's plate. ;) My rum baba came in what seemed like a pool of simple syrup. This made me worried because I do not enough overly sweet desserts. However, the syrup was balanced, not overly sweet or rum-y. The cake itself was almost egg bread life and soaked up the syrup wonderfully. The chocolate tart was the MOST AMAZING chocolate tart ever! Think dark, bitter sweet, creamy, rich and buttery. Good, right? Well, multiply that by 100 and this is what this tart tasted like. I would come back to just have this tart again."}
{"text":"Went there this summer after convincing my daily how great this pace is. Last went in 2009 and its even better than I remembered it. A gourmets delight with excellent service, ambiance and of course the meal was outstanding.

A+"}
{"text":"Received a recommendation from our bartender at Le A Bar to check out L'Express during our visit to Montreal. He said it was the best French bistro outside of France. It sure pays to chat with local bartenders!
We were able to easily book a reservation online less than 24hours out for an early 5:30pm dinner.
Our experience was one of the best dinners of our life. Accommodating to English speakers, the staff were so top notch and organized with bringing out our dishes and taking care of our requests including recommending some excellent wines to pair with our order.
I loved how they brought out a large jar of cornichons to enjoy with your food, they went great with mustard and the pork rillette we ordered for an appetizer.
We got one item from their daily specials that might have been the best dish of the meal - Fresh tomatoes with burrata cheese and pesto. We sopped up this dish with the bread L'Express provided!
The entrees we ordered were the sea bass and hanger steak. The steak had a shallot butter on top that was outrageously good. The sea bass came with some perfectly cooked fresh green beans. Overall everything was fantastic.
This really was a five star meal in every way. L'Express will be the first dining spot I'll recommend to anyone traveling to Montreal. Big thanks to Le A Bar for giving us this tip!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited L'express on our first day in Montreal for lunch. Upon entering this bistro, which is nestled on a beautiful street between many restaurants and clothing and furniture boutiques, we were instantly immersed in quintessential french aromas. Smells of, herbs like thyme, butter, and slowly braising meats and vegetables. It's a bustling busy restaurant that has a very warm and cozy atmosphere with a very friendly wait staff. 

We ordered:

House salad a blend of arugula and peppery greens topped with a simple light dressing a good starter. Delicious

Vegetable soup a tomato based soup with beef broth and lots of veggies, like quash, corn. Yum

Entrees:

Croque Monseiur fried buttery cheesy toast with ham. Delicious.

Beef stuffed Ravioli. Over the top Delicious, I used my bread to sop up all the broth from my plate because it was so delicious and flavorful.

Also the restaurant has had the same menu for 30 years most of their dishes have been perfected, so don't offend and ask for substitutions. Everything looks and probably tastes delicious. People sitting next to us ordered egg salad, salmon, stewed mushrooms and liver over fries, steak and every dish looked scrumptious."}
{"text":"This well established classic French bistro was opened in 1979 by a young couple who were frustrated that they couldn't get a good bite to eat after working long hours in the theatre. The concept was simple, provide delicious and affordable meals to everybody all the time.
Their vision still holds true today as opening hours are from 8am to 2am on most days of the week. 
So next time you are out late and hungry, forget about poutine and greasy Chinese food, swing by l'Express! Classic French bistro food doesn't get better than this!

We ordered for starters the bone marrow and octopus salad. Bone marrow was melt in your mouth buttery good. Octopus was very refreshing and well cooked but nothing out of the ordinary.
For mains we had the raviolis - simply outstanding, bursting with flavour from the pork and mushroom filling- and the roasted quail - wow again, cooked to perfection, crispy skin, well seasoned.
For dessert we tired the 'ile flottante' - huge serving of very well whipped meringue topped with an almond brittle. 

All in all, if I lived in the area I'd be going every week!"}
{"text":"Every time a demanding work obligation is over I need to celebrate with style my freedom. This is how we decided to book a dinner at L'Express and the visit was so enjoyable that we started planning another visit during the second course. 

First we loved the vibe of L'Express, the dynamics, the noise, the energy. L'Express is may be the most French bistro among all the bistros in Montreal, it is also an example that there is no need to be fancy and there is enough elegance in simplicity. 

Second we chose as our preferred sitting the bar. Nothing surprising, that has been always our beloved place to be in a restaurant as the interaction with the bar tenders may be priceless.... Don't miss the chance to enjoy a dinner at the bar is my recommendation and also ask for advice what wine matches better your food. I did not see a cocktail menu, but mixes are made on demand and they are good.    

Third the food is wonderful. I would not allow myself the extravaganza of eating bone marrow, french fries and steaks every day, but from time to time, oh yes and preferably at L'Express! The french fries are amazing and they are served with home made mayo. The hanger steak and steak tartare were superb. Don't get me wrong, there are some healthier choices in the menu. We also loved the home made pickles, and the extensive dessert list, and the endless digestive options, including few choices of Armagnac.

Genuine five stars and shared love!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. It was the first time I had ever gone. The food was spectacular, the staff were wonderful and the ambiance was quaint. It was perfect.
Our waiter was extremely helpful with helping us choose the perfect win to pair with our dishes. I had the rillettes as an entr√©e (out of this world great!!!) and the grilled salmon on a bed of spinach as my main (Holy mother of pearl.. I still dream about it).. And because I'm a pig, I decided to try the dessert that they are \"known\" for; the Floating Island Dessert. It was so great that my boyfriend said (and I quote) \"I should get one of these for home if it keeps you so quiet\"...

A MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Family of four adults dining at 5:30 pm on a Thursday night. We had a reservation and got seated promptly. We had very attentive, but unobtrusive wait staff. We asked the waiter what some of his dinner and dessert favorites were and he did well by recommending the veal ravioli (bites of heaven), the Special pork (tender and juicy) and the Shrimp Risotto (rich). My son had the hangar steak and loved the peppery seasoning on it. We also tried the bone marrow and the goat cheese salad for starters, all delicious. We finished with two deserts, the profiteroles with maple ice cream and the rice pudding with the drizzled Carmel sauce both lovely despite already being stuffed to the gills. The food was outstanding and I would definitely come again. The Foodie family gives it  for service, ambience (not pretentious) and food."}
{"text":"I was a bit hesitant in coming here 'cause I'd rather eat at a dive with good food, than some upscale, snotty place where you get a piece of asparagus with some sauce drizzled on top.  So yes, I was a bit worried about the whole portion size vs. cost et notorious French snobbery!

However, I am happy to report that the service, from the host to the aproned waiters was not pretentious at all.  Both water/wine were refilled without prompting.  Furthermore, the portions are quite fair for the amount that you pay.  

I had the saut√© duck confit and duck was nicely seasoned.  Even though duck was on a bed of greens, I left totally satisfied.  I didn't get to taste it, but apparently the shrimp risotto was really good!  If I was more comfortable (and hungry), I would've ordered an app, but didn't get a chance.  

Entr√©es were like mid-$20s while bottles of wine started at mid-$30s.  Not bad for a special occasion!

Tip:  Reservations are a-must!"}
{"text":"We came to Montreal for my friend's birthday trip. We looked through Yelp and picked this highly rated restaurant to celebrate my friend's birthday. It was a big disappointment. The service was just ok. They do have menus in French and English but the one in English doesn't have prices on it. The food was meh. We ordered bone marrow, foie gras, oysters, country soup, fish soup, quail, steak tartare and pork. The bone marrow and foie gras were greasy. I am not a fan of those dishes. Oysters was fresh and tasty. Country soup was ok. Fish soup was kinda watery and weak. For the main dishes, the steak tartare was my fav. It was nicely flavored and the fries came with it were crispy and good. My friend like the quail. The sauce mixed with rice was good. The pork was recommended by the waiter but it was not as good as I expected. The pork itself was tender but the sauce is not that good. Their prices were very reasonable but I do t think I will come again. I'd rather pay a little bit more to have food that make me satisfied."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

Regular french bistro to me. I have to admit I was a tad disappointed when we came here after all the hype we heard. Probably it was because we were here for brunch where the offering is rather standard and it's really hard to stand out. Seems like all the raving reviews here are on their dinners. Oh well."}
{"text":"Well, a classy french restaurant with executive service and fine menu!
I entered the place at 2:00 AM just to munch something. I was not expecting a warm welcome but people here are amazing and they simply get it that in the middle of the night what people are coming for.

I had a salad, which was amazing and so fresh. They give pickles, bread etc complimentary. And they are generous with it.

They offer highest grade food and wide selection of drinks. The wines selection in particular is outstanding. 
Anyway if you need excellent food in middle of the night this is your place!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I visited this restaurant when I was in Montreal last week. The food was fantastic. We started with the bone marrow, which was interesting but good. I had the duck confit over salad and my partner had the lobster risotto. Both dishes were absolutely delicous. The risotto was perfeclty cooked and the duck wasn't too greasy. Also, the vinigrette was really tasty and I enjoyed the texture of the salad. Definitely indulge in some dessert. The flan and chocolate tart were incredible. The prices were really reasonable.  The staff was great and you don't need to speak French."}
{"text":"I don't understand what all the hype is about. This restaurant is quite good but nothing special. Out of four nights in Montreal, we EXPECTED this one to be our best meal (we were told this restaurant had an international reputation!) but it actually came in third out of four. It's good quality but somewhat underwhelming as an overall experience.  

We ordered two appetizers: the pate and the mushroom tart (which was a special). The mushroom tart was AMAZING - by far the best of what we ordered. It came with arugula on top with a very tasty dressing, cheese, and ham. The balance of flavors and textures was excellent. The pate was ordinary. 

For entrees we ordered the roasted duck with red wine reduction sauce and roasted figs; and the halibut (both were daily specials). The duck was excellent -- in a very rich and flavorful sauce, nice mix of savory and sweet with the figs. The halibut  was just so-so. The halibut itself was bland and quite dry. The roasted red-pepper sauce was good but the best part about this dish was the bed of zucchini strips (cut thin like pasta). 

The atmosphere was lively and casual. The room was bright and loud. Not particularly romantic or fancy. (For example, of four nights  we spent in Montreal this was the only night we didn't get cloth napkins). The place felt more like a diner than a fancy restaurant. I didn't feel there was anything special about the atmosphere -- especially given how many other cool, cozy, romantic restaurants there are in town. The bread and butter they served was not very  good - bread was slightly dry, butter was too hard, and they did not give you small plates to serve yourself bread with.  

The service was excellent and very friendly.  However, our overall experience was just a bit underwhelming. It was nothing like the total-quality experience of other Montreal restaurants we experienced. I would say it's very good, but nothing special. If there hadn't been so much hype about this place we might have gone with more tempered expectations and enjoyed it a bit more. As it is, I would say it's a good solid place with decent food, but I have no idea why there is so much hype about it. Maybe we just ordered the wrong things."}
{"text":"Very friendly restaurant and a great dinner. We were delighted with every thing we ordered from appetizers to desert. The waiter was a bit slow but nothing major. A very good address!"}
{"text":"Booked here in advance before going to Montreal cos of the reviews.
The place is as cute as a button, and feels like U are completely somewhere else.
Anyway, food wise, I had their bone marrow  to start and veal kidney mustard entrees. 
Let put it this way, I've tried bone marrow once, when we spotted Waitrose  selling them - not sure why, possible the easy we cooked it - it was super Disgusting! Maybe we didn't know how to cook it right or something...anyway the one I had in this place didn't taste/smell anything like the one I cooked!
The fat was well balance on the thin crisp bread with a pinch of salt. 
Veal kidney with mustard sauce was OK, but I won't order that again if I return. 
Finally the floating island! Amazing piece of art!!!! You got to order this even just to look at it!"}
{"text":"This was our 3rd time eating here and did not disappoint. We chose to sit at the bar as we love chatting with the wait staff behind the bar. Had the beet salad and the risotto. Very good food, great ambiance and in a great area of town (St. Denis). Fantastic wine list. Will definitely return here."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant so many times that I lost count. Well obviously I love it so much that's why the repeated return.
Service has always been very good, professional and attentive. 
The ambience is energetic, very French, and European feel. Little tables with white paper on them, which is a classic bistro/brasserie feels. It is a smaller version of Balthazar in NYC, but the menu is much better than Balthazar. 
They have items that are hard to find i.e. Veal Liver, Veal Kidneys, Rabbit Terrine and etc. Food taste really authentic, well executed and classically presented. 
Dessert wise expect creme br√ªl√©e, profiteroles, lemon tart, chocolate tart, floating island. 
Expectation is always met with no disappointment. 
Price wise in my opinion is reasonable and fair for the quality you get. 
Will definitely return again & again, and I highly recommend this place when visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"3.5- L'Express is a classic French bistro and the food is classically good. However, I failed to see what the hype was all about, as the food was very good but not necessarily significantly better than any of my other Montr√©al dining experiences. 

Then chicken liver pate with pistachios was delicious, as was the foie gras terrine. The bone marrow was good, but a huge hassle to eat because the spoons didn't fit inside properly. Each table is given a jar of adorable little pickles and they were delicious! 

For my main, I had the quail and it was pretty good, nothing to write home about. One of my friends had the shrimp risotto and that was delicious! Someone who had the lemon sage chicken breast reported that it was incredibly dry. But if you're looking for something a little different, the calf liver was delicious!

The service was good but not terribly attentive. We had to remind our waitress to bring silverware a couple times, but I totally get that we were eating during a Friday lunch rush. 

Overall, delicious and good. I think my expectations were overhyped by all the amazing reviews and recommendations, so my actual experience at L'Express fell a little short."}
{"text":"A throughly enjoyable evening, in spite of the fact that they were out of the bone marrow when we arrived. 
The setting is very French with the requisite zinc bar and black and white tile floor. Loud, but appropriately so. Snug but not uncomfortable. The rilette and chicken liver pate were very good and abundant, and the cornichons are a nice touch. We had Hanger steak frites and Pot au feu. The steak was expertly cooked with restrained seasoning and a luscious herb butter. The frites were thick and served with aioli. My wifes Pot au Feu was less successful, the individual elements were very good, but they just didn't seem to come together. 
The wine list is excellent and fairly priced, although more by the glass selections would be nice. The service was spot on. Pleasant, helpful without being cloying. My glass of Haut-Medoc was off and swept away without question. 
We felt it very fairly priced with the aforementioned meals, one cocktail (a rare in Montreal, High Ball glass with plenty of Gin!) 4 glasses of wine for $120.
All in all a very nice experience, but I wouldn't call it a culinary mecca ."}
{"text":"This place is almost always excellent, food, service, everything! Only time it's bad is Christmas week, but that's fair enough! Just go.....end of! You'll be pleased :)"}
{"text":"L'Express is probably one of the most known restaurants in Montreal and is generally booked solid.  If you have the foresight to make a reservation, great, if not, try and get here right after it opens around 5 or 5:30.  The restaurant was just getting together and we were able to snag a table as long as we were out within an hour (or rather before the person whose table we were sitting at showed up).  I had a plane to catch so it wasn't a problem.

The main menu is in French but they have English versions.  I cannot comment on all of the food but  I'd highly recommend the duck confit salad.  The fatty duck and the light salad made for a good pairing.  The foie gras app was also good.  The foie gras was served cold, which I've never seen before, and is meant to be smeared on the bread accompanying the dish.  Prices aren't outrageous but they add up quickly.

If this place is booked try Au Pied de Cochon which is a few blocks away to the NE.  Either of these two restaurants will make your night."}
{"text":"Worst experience, booked it through on open table and found out it's for the New York location when got there. Nothing on the website mentioned that! Sucks!!"}
{"text":"The quintessential French bistro but in Montreal...if you're looking for that French experience in Montreal and not in Paris you'll love this place!
Visiting Montreal and want French food put this place on your list! The food is fanatic, the service is professional and cordial and atmosphere splendid.
FonFonFon!!! vive Pari!!!!"}
{"text":"* Still a favourite *

It has been many years since I visited L'express, and I went with a bit of nervousness as I have such great memories there.  Thankfully they lived up to my memories once again!

I had a very simple lunch of pot au feu, which was perfect in every way.  The beef was incredibly tender, the carrots were the perfect consistency, the cabbage was not overdone, the chicken was tender and flavourful, and they even included a bone with marrow.  I love marrow - it is the ultimate comfort food for me, and was a lovely addition!  It came very simply presented with the usual baguette with a nice butter, a side of mustard and a big pot of cornichon.  Simple.  Delicious.  Perfect!

I followed with my favourite dessert from many years ago, the iles flottantes.  Still just as good!  A huge fresh perfectly fluffy meringue had a beautiful caramelized crunchy coating which had a few almond slices to enhance the flavour.  This was served on a perfect creme anglaise which had just the right amount of vanilla flavour.  This lived up to my memories!

I love this spot, and am so happy to know it is still just as good!"}

Everything about this place
Apple tart was akin to apple pie but tastier and less filling
Quail is easily the highlight of the menu (although it has poor re-heat value)

++
I enjoyed the proseco, wasn't a fan of the rose wine
Steak frites
Large portions, two people can be satiated off appetizer and dinner (and we were very hungry)
Goat cheese and chestnut appetizer was warm and delicious
Typically priced dinner (2 wines, 1 app, 2 meals, dessert, was around $100)

Bilingual staff
Environment is simple and romantic
Full, but not too full (where you have to wait) on a Sunday night, so you know it's good"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this quaint little French bistro with random Palm trees. Fantastic food for a reasonable prices. Come here for dinner or lunch. We decided to stop by for lunch, which offered its dinner menu as well. I ordered the truffled boudin Blanc, seeing that I was in Canada I was going to try all the French Canadian foods. Boy, this was a great dish with a super yummy truffled sauce and cooked root yet crunchy vegetables. I've tried boudin noir at a different restaurant the night before and that was a little off putting. Boudin Blanc here was fantastic, nothing I have eaten before. My other half ordered the mushroom ravioli. Also, a really hearty tasty dish. We decided to share the bone marrow. This was a very large portion, enough for four people! It came with tons of bread, a really big jar of pickles, and mustard seeds. 

Overall, fantastic experience. Would love to come back here for a quiet, homey, hearty dinner. Until next time, Montreal!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and decor. Really reminded me and my wife of a Parisian bistro. She had the roasted quail and I had duck (might have been a special of the day). Both were tasty but I would take the quail next time."}
{"text":"I don't understand what's the big deal???
It's not that good
My wife ordered a Sorrel Soup and sent it back immediately - had no taste.
The fish was mediocre and the Quail was OK.
We will not come back"}
{"text":"Our original plan of just hanging out in Quebec City went awry as I investigated the possibility of a turn around bus ride to Montreal. We booked our tickets for the bus ride and embarked on our trek to the bigger city! I tried really hard to get reservations to Au Pie du Cochon because of Anthony Bourdain. After relentless attempts, we were not able to get in! This is where Yelp helps! Looking at the myriad of restaurants, we made our way to L' Express without reservations, we walked in and were able to get a table but needed to be out by 7 because someone was smart enough to reserve a table. We were nicely greeted with a humongo jar of tiny pickles and bread,  boy were those pickles nice and sour! I started with the duck confit salad, it was excellent, with nice tender pieces of slow cooked duck meat cooked in its own fat. I then proceeded with the bone marrow. I was in heaven as my plate made its way, there were enough bones to feast the eyes! The marrow was succulent ad seasoned just right. Slather them bad boys on some toasted baguettes and you just died and gone to heaven! To drink, we tried the house local blonde which was amazing!
All in all, I am glad that we stopped in, I think you will be too!"}
{"text":"The tartare was the best I've ever had (better than in Paris!), and the Batista was a pro. Perfectly constructed cafe au lait. This restaurant really raised the bar for a quality dining experience, and really made my trip. Great!"}
{"text":"Vive l'Express, Bravo au chef Ghislain Roy et sa salade de bettrave. Tout est bon."}
{"text":"Excellent classic French bistro - does the classics well - hangar steak, etc 0plus great service and nice desserts"}
{"text":"I made a reservation online and received a confirmation email. I found L'Express on Yelp and was very excited to try it out for a more upscale option on our anniversary trip in Montreal. 

The waitress came to our table and then multiple make waiters came over (drop off food/ water). They were professional.  We started off with the fish soup (had tomato base) and came with mini cheese toasts. Also ordered the special: stuffed zucchini with black garlic. Both were good but I wasn't blown away. 
The main course and dessert blew us away though..
Main course: fresh sea bass and green beans 
Wowza!! Deliciousness 
Croque Monsieur (melted French ham & cheese) this was to die for and I got the side salad (huge) instead of fries. 
Dessert: leave room for the raspberry vanilla macaroon (best!!) made in house
The made in house truffle was good yet rich

The black and white tile floors were very French feeling and we enjoyed our L'Express experience. Next time we might sit at the bar for the croque Monsieur, sea bass, and a FEW macaroons. Bon appetite"}
{"text":"My husband and me visited Montreal for our honeymoon. And we choose here for our first dinner in Montreal. It was a great experience for us. The atmosphere, service and food were good. 
We've ordered warm goat cheese \"bone marrow with coarse salt\",  \"warm goat cheese salad\", \"roasted quail with wild rice\" and \"fresh sea bass with saut√©ed vegetables\". Roasted quail was very juicy and tasty. Spreading with wild rice, it was a brilliant combination. The fresh sea bass was sweet and tender. Both of appetizers were great. Overall it was a great experience for us."}
{"text":"Nestled along the myriad shops and restaurants on St. Denis, L'express is a wonderful French Bistro with terrific food and a bright lively atmosphere.  They have an extensive wine list and a compact but terrific assortment of classic French dishes.  Reservations are highly recommended, but the BF and I had no problem reserving a table the same day on the later side of dinner on a Friday night.

We both started with the green salad (which was fine), and ordered for our mains the beef tartare and the steak frites.  His tartare (which came with a mountain of fries and was ordered to be spicy) was very good; definitely a good move to get it spicy to bring out the dish's flavors.  My steak frites, however, were damn near perfect.  The meat was so juicy, flavorful, and tender, and when eaten with the herbed butter, forget it.  It was out of this world.  Dinner also included delicious crusty french bread, and the only cornichons I have ever eaten that I have truly liked (perhaps because they are served in a large mason jar which allows them to marinate in their own juices).

While the service was a bit slow and the waiters seemed a little stand-offish, the food was definitely worth it.  I would definitely return the next time I'm in town and I highly recommend a visit for anyone in the neighborhood or passing through."}
{"text":"Moderately priced great French Quebec cuisine.
Never been to a place like this in France, so can't really compare.
But for me, this was as French as it gets.

We tried:
Bone Marrow - very interesting.
Beef Tartare - great.
Smoked Salmon - yummy.
Some salad with cheese - I didn't try it but my friend liked it.
Apple Crumb Tarte with Vanilla ice cream - amazing.

Complimentary baguette with butter & mustard, and house pickles are GREAT.

With all the food + coffee, 2 red wine glasses + 2 beers = under $100.

Definitely the place to go when looking for a good French Quebec restaurant.

BEST SERVICE in Montreal!!!"}
{"text":"I had read earlier reviews on Yelp and was intrigued to find out if it was a good as going to Paris. My partner, who works for an airline, and I decided for a short get away to someplace we had never been. As experienced \"space available\" travellers we usually \"fly by the seat of our pants\" so to speak and don't make set plans. With this said, we decided to venture out to L'express with no reservation. We arrived at the restaurant at about 6:30pm and enquired about a table. The Maitre'd said that there was one table reserved for 4 at 8pm, however if we could finish dinner in 1 and half hours it was ours... Sold.. 

The menu was handwritten in French, however they also have a printed menu in English, Spanish and Italian. The waiter asked us if the English menu would be of assistance... another point for service. 

Since we were on a time crunch we ordered 2 courses each and decided to wait and see about dessert. I ordered the Octopus and Lentil salad and Martin had smoked salmon... The Octopus and Lentil Terrine was light, refreshing and set the tone for the rest of the meal. Martin enjoyed his smoked salmon immensely. Next he ordered the duck con-fit on a bed of greens and green beans while I ordered the shrimp risotto. Both were absolutely magnificent! It really was like we were in Paris! 

We decided to skip the dessert as we were almost approaching the 8pm hour, however I did see some of the choices and they looked spectacular. 

I will definitely be back to this restaurant on my next visit to Montreal. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here our first night in Montreal. We were here on a Tuesday night and even though the place was crowded, we did not have trouble getting a table. We had the bone marrow and foie gras terrine to start. The bone marrow was fine but very simple. I would have enjoyed a little onion jam or a small parsley salad to go with it. The foie gras terrine was good but very similar to other foie gras terrines I have had. My husband had a duck confit salad for his entree. It was tasty and had a nice variety of vegetables. I had the steak tartare and it came with fries. The steak tartare was good, but not that different from the tartare I have had in Chicago. The fries were kind of thick and not very crispy.  Nothing really stood out to us. Although the food did not wow us, the ambiance was nice and the service was friendly. We really enjoyed the half bottle of wine that the waiter suggested for us too. However, this place isn't cheap and for the price, I think you can find tastier food."}
{"text":"A hard place to review because I liked the food but I don't know if I want to come back. 

First, the service was great. The waiters explained the menu in detail and took their time, answered our questions. The dessert menu is not in English, and the waiter explained the entire menu for us.

The fish soup was flavorful. It was kind of like lobster bisque just rougher in texture and less creamy (hence the soup, not bisque). The stale bread crusted with dry melted cheese it came with actually paired pretty well. 

The raviolis and quail with wild rice I think had the same sauce (veal stock), which was nice. Just wish we didn't get both because it just seemed repetitive. Raviolis, if five of them were stacked, I would have loved it but then it wouldn't be a ravioli. 

Quail was cooked so nicely. Both the leg and breast were tender and juicy, and the wild rice added interesting firm texture to each bite.

The floating island dessert - We didn't like it at all. An interesting looking dessert with boring taste. It was just sweet. It just tasted like candy. Ate one third of it and wanted to say something.

So overall, we had a pretty good meal with great service with some standouts and some fallouts.But for the price, I could have had a better meal. A solid 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"This is quite possible the grande dame of restaurants in Montreal. It's French bistro done right. Everything is fresh and delicious. The wine list is fabulous. The food is excellent. The service varies between decent and deliciously surly (keeping pace with stereotypes). I'd recommend requesting the goat cheese cheesecake as soon as you sit down as they often run out."}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed my dinner at L'Express. It's been around for a while, and definitely has that late '70s vibe that hasn't been updated, but that's part of the charm of feeling like you're in a restaurant that's no fuss, no trends, just good classic food. The warm goat cheese salad and the duck rillette were great appetizers. The bread was perfectly chewy and crunchy, and the classic Montreal spread with the jar of gherkins and mustard were surprisingly delicious. The quail entree was fantastic- juicy, crispy skin, chewy black rice, and a beautiful presentation. My family also enjoyed the ravioli and the steak frites. If you like French food, I'd recommend this restaurant for sure."}
{"text":"The food was good but I have definitely had better. I wouldn't come back voluntarily. 
The waiter was quite... how do I put this... special? I decided to take the roasted quails with wild rice, so this is how the conversation went (in French and yes, I speak fluent French and so did he)
Me: Could you put less rice and more vegetables for my plate?
Him: (* *) hm.. sorry no, it's pre-portioned
Me:...  what? hm... (-.-)
Him: ya, sorry
Me...Ooookkkk... well never mind what I said then...
Him: Do you want us to put more vegetables instead?
Me: (Dumbfounded) Euh... I do prefer to have more vegetables but if you keep all of the rice, I will not finish my plate and I don't want to waste
Him: aw.. you aren't very hungry, ya sorry
Me....
Him: But you DO know it's wild rice, right?
Me: (giving all my might not to give him any sarcastic response)

SERIOUSLY????"}
{"text":"I came here with my family after reading and hearing rave-reviews about this \"institution\" of a place. The service was decent, a bit slower than I had expected, but our waiter was nice and everyone was very professional and polite. We got the goat cheese salad as an appetizer which was good but not exceptional. For our main courses we had the quail and wild rice, duck confit with salad, hangar steak, and steak tartare. All were very good except my father didn't like the tartare (note this is the first time he's ever had it and he's not too partial to French food). We all enjoyed our meals and were really full - I thought the portions were very generous for a French restaurant.

The exceptional part of the evening was the dessert: the floating island which was this delicious mixture of eggwhite and caramel and deliciousness...hard to describe but the perfect size for 4 people to share after a filling meal. We will consider coming back just for the dessert!"}
{"text":"I have heard very good things about this place and tried it recently but got highly disappointed.

Food was very flavourful and bringing us back to France, but portions are way too small (typical French for sure as well) and the service was miserable. I heard better things but couldn't get the chance to experience it fully I guess."}
{"text":"We went here for an anniversary dinner. This place really does feel like eating back in France. I had the steak tartar which was perfect. My girlfriend got the calf liver and she also loved it. The service was very friendly (even though we didn't speak french). Overall we were very pleased."}
{"text":"Classic French food at its best - unstuffy, yummy food with unstuffy, kind service.  We arrive here at 10:30 following the Opera to find a bustling restaurant with happy looking patrons fishing cornichons out of jars as they talked animatedly.

I was feeling a little self-conscious reading the French menu, but the waitstaff were nice and walked us through the specials.  *Make sure* to ask about these, as we ended up exclusively ordering from them and it was totally the way to go.

To start I had oeufs mayonnaise, and would have licked the plate if it weren't improper to do so.  Instead I mopped up every bit of mayonnaise with the delicious bread, and ate more than my share of cornichons.

My husband had the fiddleheads in mushroom sauce with pancetta and almonds.  I had never had fiddleheads before and might never eat them again unless prepared in this manner.  The dish was creamy without being heavy and the fiddleheads weren't overwhelmed by the other ingredients.

We both ordered the same special for our main dish, and went with a blended red recommended by our waiter (it paired very well, just bitter enough without feeling like an astringent).  It was pork sausage with mashed potatoes and a veal ragout.  I loved the unpretentious nature of L'Express, underscored when they served this dish with dijon mustard for the sausage.  I feel the same dish in New York would have been accompanied by some ridiculous foam of some sort (or have I been watching too much Top Chef?).  The potatoes brought me back to childhood Thanksgivings, and the sausage was rustic and homemade.  I left L'Express feeling like I had eaten an intimate supper at a rural French grandmother's table."}
{"text":"Weekend trip to Montreal and we wanted some french classics. Admittedly, our first attempt was for a reservation at au pied de cochon but they were booked. Called Sunday morning and was only able to get a 10pm reservation at L'express but we took it and we're glad we did. 

First, definitely make a reservation in advance. We figured it would be empty at 10 on a Sunday but it was completely packed. 

Started with the octopus salad. Perfect starter. Moved on to the foie gras terrine. It was rich, creamy and decadent. As foie gras should be. We moved on to the cured ham plate which was okay, could've done without.  Finally we had the duck confit salad and the ravioli. The ravioli was OUTSTANDING. We regretted not having enough room to scarf all of them down. They were rich and delicious. Definitely order them. The duck confit salad, eh. The duck had quite a gamey taste and just paled in comparison to the ravioli. Our waiter recommended a half bottle of Bordeaux which paired perfectly to our dishes. The service was excellent, the ambience was cool - not too loud and appropriately trendy. 

We would definitely return on our next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Wonderful French resto in Montreal! L'Express is a must meal when in town.

One of the few places to dine at in the area that stays open late. It might seem fancy but it's actually a very casual spot.

Terrific service, cool Parisian ambiance, and very tasty food which is well prepared. They even have a great bar to chill at and partake in a few libations. Reasonably priced all around for food, wine, and cocktails.

It was so good we stopped in here for dinner a few times while on vacation. Some of the highlights were the Country Style Soup and the Fish Soup, Grilled Salmon, Shrimp Risotto, and their amazing l'isle de caramel for dessert! Loved that dessert - just wow, and so fun to eat.

I wish I could go back there for dinner tonight!"}
{"text":"Despite the vast selection of French food in Montreal, l'Express is French cuisine in its purest form - rich, decadent, and soaked in butter, with a jar of mini pickles on the side.  The menu is stellar, and as authentic as they come. And while I haven't tasted everything that they offer, the 5 or 6 app/entree combos that I have tried have been more than satisfying. 

Oh, and did I mention that L'Express is one of the few restaurants whose kitchen stays open past 11pm. Seriously, for a city renowned for our cuisine, this sure is a rarity. 

Bonus: the waiters are like hawks, scoping out empty bread baskets within seconds of emptying, and are quick to remedy the situation, over and over and over again."}
{"text":"The bone marrow was unique bit really filling for one person. Nice French atmosphere"}
{"text":"Lively atmosphere and wonderful French bistro fare make this a must visit restaurant in Montreal. We shared a few appetizers including the sorrel soup (not a big fan), a special beet salad (very good), and I had a fish special which was also very good. Had the apple tart for dessert and it was very simple yet delicious."}
{"text":"Classic Bistro feel and open for late night dining. The Standards are all here and their ravioli is signature. The service was superb and extremely efficient - complete professionals."}
{"text":"Tried twice to make a reso at this place foot dinner. One time they asked us to hold on to conform and left us on hold until we hung up. Second time they did not even pic up the phone. I hear the food is good here, too bad I won't be bringing my business here."}
{"text":"REALLY nice vibe. Staff was super friendly and attentive. Not stuffy at all. The food was delicious. The decor is fun (modern/sleek bistro, if you can imagine). Best meal we've had in Montreal."}
{"text":"Sorry, L'express, but you did not impress me with either the quality of service, nor the quality of your food. I went to L'express past 12pm, so my options of good food in Montreal were quite limited. Let's start off with service. Our waitress didn't give a **** if we understood the menu or had any questions. To me, that's a bad signal right there. Second, the food wasn't great. The quiche was not fresh and my steak was thin and had a lot of fat in it, when I was expecting a nice thick steak. So, I ended up paying quite a penny for food that I did not enjoy. Next time, I'll be going somewhere else for sure if I'm craving good food past midnight in Montreal."}
{"text":"Would probably give 3.5 stars if I could but 3 is too low. It was overall a good meal but with some issues:

1) The beef tartare is the worst I've ever had and surprisingly they give a lot of it. I'm used to never having enough of it but instead we left a bunch on our plate. Not sure what the issue was. Perhaps it was a bit too warm, perhaps the meat was not high quality enough? Pass on this one.

2) Hanger steak and frites was delicious. Would definitely order again, and it was cooked exactly how I asked for it. 

3) If you are going at a busy time consider having a snack beforehand. The food took a good bit of time to come out so we ended up filling up on bread which made the meal less enjoyable when it finally came. Don't go here hungry and ready to eat immediately."}
{"text":"This is the restaurant that people from Montreal tell visitors to go to and also eat at themselves. It's a classic French bistro, reasonably priced, with a ton of regulars. On a recent trip, I had no less that 8 different locals tell me that it was \"essential\" that I go here. Why? The Wine.
The wine list is AHHmazing, heavy on French wines, especially the south of France, many bottles of which cannot be found elsewhere due to a direct relationship between the buyers and the wine makers. Furthermore, for someone (moi) who has fallen madly and in absolute bonkers in love with natural wine/ vin naturel, the menu makes it easy to pick them out, as they are denoted as (bio.) on the menu. Did I mention that the markup on the wines are extremely reasonable? I saw bottles listed on the menu sold at or below US retail cost, whereas at restaurants bottles can be marked up 200-300% plus. What a great, classic spot. I'm so glad the locals who pointed me out to this place shared the joy."}
{"text":"Went to this place later last night (10pm) on the recommendation of another restaurant whose kitchen closed at 10pm. Wonderful experience. We shared the rilettes l'express (chicken pate), octopus and lentil salad and warm goat cheese salad for our starters. Chicken pate came with a slice of dried apricot on it and was absolutely delicious and flavourful. The octopus was tender and the warm goat cheese salad was sublime. All three dishes were very rich and filling and probably enough for us but we were greedy and ordered a main- the chicken in lemon and sage sauce. Probably the moistest chicken breast I have ever had, the sauce was amazing too. Food came fast, service was impeccable. The cost of our meal was unbelievably reasonable, including bottle of wine- 50 bucks per person! Would 100% come back here the next time I visit Montreal!"}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I made a reservation for 9:30 on a Saturday night, but we strolled in 30 minutes earlier and they sat us at the bar. The waiter was very curt but efficient and he knew that we're tourists, so he handed us the English menu.

We started with:
Fish soup - really rich and thick which was not what I was expecting but it was quite enjoyable. It came with 4 pieces of cheese encrusted baquette which was a tad bit chewy. Overall, it was good and quite a big portion as a starter. I was pretty much good kind of full after finishing my bowl of soup.

Octopus and lentil salad - my fianc√© loved this dish, it was a well balanced flavour, texture and acidity. It was again a pretty big portion but tasty!

As our main we had:
Onglet (steak frites) - I ordered my hangar steak medium rare and it was quite tasty with the compound butter. The fries was really good too, but after the appetizer I only had room for the steak. My fianc√© loved the steak!

Duck confit salad - The duck was shredded on a bed of greens, and you get a good portion of the duck. It was a nice balanced dish.

Overall, my fianc√© and I will be back, and perhaps share an appetizer instead of ordering one per person."}
{"text":"Yes! Another Montreal classic. L'express is both the most memorable and most forgettable restaurant you've ever been to. It was so memorable, that I have to write this glowing review, however, it was so forgettable that I could never remember the name, could never figure out how to search for it, or how to even describe in a somewhat unique way. And yet it is just that - unique. Oddly enough.

The whole reason I went to Montreal was to experience Europe for half the money and take in a Habs game. I took in the Habs game on a Saturday, and had Sunday night to have my romantic poor-man's Europe experience. L'express delivered.

From the outside, this place is completely non-descript and somewhat forgettable. You could walk by it on Rue St. Denis and choose a thousand other restaurants over it in pretty quick fashion. But, if you come in from the ridiculous winter cold, you get a totally wonderful experience. L'express is, in my opinion, the ultimate French bistro. Not that I've ever been to France, but if I had to paint a picture of what the ultimate French bistro in France would and should look, sound, and feel like, L'express would be it. Checkered floors, a long, classic bar area, and a narrow table-clothed dining area. It's fine-dining, but rough enough that you picture some poor, disaffected artists eating frites in the corner. We sat at the bar, and the bartender spoke absolutely NO english. Perfect. 

We ordered a small glass of the house red, which was $5.00 CAD. Awesome. I think the house red was still a French red. Don't see that much anymore. This being a French bistro, I went with the hangar steak frites, so I could try and compare it on even terms with the more faux-french american bistro's I'm used to. Perfect. The hangar steak was wonderfully cooked in the simplest of preparations, the frites were undeniably wonderful, and the whole meal was delivered as efficiently as possible with as much charm as possible from the french-speaking bartender. I also remember eating some of those cornichons in the picture, though I'm fuzzy on how that came about. Maybe it comes with their totally awesome french table bread?

Overall, L'express is fast, affordable, romantic, poetic, and delicious. It's like having a dream about Montreal more than actually being in Montreal."}
{"text":"Simply fantastic array of cuisine.  Ambiance. Kitchen is open late!"}
{"text":"Les rillettes etaient mauvaises (de la bouillie), le steak tartare etait horrible (pas d'echalotte aucun gout), la soupe de poissons (pas de fenouil, de la puree, tres mal faite), la mayonnaise...la mayonnaise... mauvaise mais mauvaise...
Enorme deception, cet endroit a perdu tout son charme, aucun interet, je le deconseille fortement."}
{"text":"When traveling on business I search for restaurants with a bar and superb food. L'express filled that need. Yes, it is a certain business tourist destination, but what I really liked is being treated like a queen, served with perfect wine pairings and the bartenders wonderfully delicious french accents. The fish soup was delightful and the company was even better."}
{"text":"A very traditional French restaurant. We started off with the chicken liver pate appetizer, which was delicious. My husband had the chicken and I had the spaghetti with mushrooms, both of which were very good. For dessert he had the apple and blueberry crumble and I had the cr√®me caramel a l'orange. The service was excellent and the ambience was really that of a old French bistro in Paris."}
{"text":"D√©√ßu des d√©jeuners ! Je sais bien que l'Express n'est pas une place pour les d√©jeuners, mais le choix n'√©tait pas grand, j'avais faim en sortant et de plus la serveuse avait pas l'air trop aimable et serviable. J'y retournerais pas pour les d√©jeuners mais plut√¥t pour les lunchs ou les soupers."}
{"text":"I was never a big fan of the dinner menu but the breakfast is a fantastic value in Montreal.  Some of the best scrambled eggs I've had in Montreal (easier to screw up than you think).  Service with a smile.

Gets a little pretentious in the evening."}
{"text":"perfectly traditional French bistro; classic French food without the super expensive prices; menu is in French;  can't get much better; been outstanding for years in montreal; you must save room for dessert"}
{"text":"Definitely a memorable experience! 

Came here for brunch and was lucky enough to chance upon what we were told was the last unreserved table for two. Service was friendly, helpful, accommodating, and quick, and I loved the old-school, elegant bistro ambiance.

Food was absolutely delicious! The French toast and scrambled eggs were amazingly fluffy, and the sausages, introduced as \"house-made\", were flavourful and not at all greasy. 

The caf√© Americano was rich, and the orange juice tasted extremely fresh, probably even freshly squeezed!

An excellent experience!
Highly recommended (although probably a good idea to make reservations just in case), and would definitely return!"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best.  The worst escargot excuse I have ever tried.  It was cold!! Wtf?  The rest of our meal was ok.  I enjoyed the scallops and the rabbit... The service was good and the waiter was very knowledgeable and that is one of the reasons they are not getting 1 star.  I do not know why this place is talked about and rated so highly!! I would not recommend this place to anyone who enjoys good food.  Another benefit is that they are open so late..."}
{"text":"If you ever want to have a decadent lunch or dinner by yourself sometime, come here, sit yourself down, order the bone marrow starter, the steak frites, a glass of wine and then let a completely sensuous eating experience unfold.

After hitting the Sri Aurobindo store down the street and my mind still immersed in the rarefied spiritual air of Hindu futurist philosophy, I found myself in this part of town yesterday and realized it had been awhile since I had been to L'Express, easily hands down one of the best French (as in from France) bistros in town. 

You will find all the old stand-by classics of any French bistro or brasserie whether here or in Paris, homemade mayonnaise, chicken liver pate, bread, baguette slices, cornichons (gherkins), French onion soup gratinee, calf liver, steak tartare, steak frites, profiteroles, creme brulee, cheese plates, extensive wine and digestif lists, a bar full of brass fixings, mirrors, lively conversation happening everywhere, and a general air of conviviality. 

Yesterday we had the first snowfall of the winter and I was craving something comforting, warm and rich. The bone marrow starter hit the spot. Unctuous, rich, decadent and probably very bad for you, you can't eat something like this every other day. Served up in its bone, with toasted baguette slices, this is a treat and can rival a filet mignon in its richness and taste. (I'm just surprised how bone marrow has suddenly become an \"It\" item in recent years when we've been eating it for centuries in Muslim India in the form of Nihari, a super-slow cooked curry soup full of bone marrow and meat). 

The steak frites came with homemade mayonnaise and a slice of parsley butter melting all over the steak. Again, perfect. There was absolutely no way I was going to be able to have a dessert particularly the famous floating island so I settled on a single scoop of lemon sorbet instead to offset the richness of the meal.

Attentive and friendly service, wonderful food, great lively atmosphere, you'd be hard-pressed to find something as established and classic as L'Express."}
{"text":"Best French Bistro!

Dude. It was all about the duck when I came. Duck p√¢t√©. Duck confit. OMG. Duck fat is amazing. AMAZING. I definitely have to agree with other customers, that the fois gras was freaking awesome. It was a hard choice though, everything on the menu looked so good. They have lots of pickles. Maybe I just don't know what's going on, but part of the service is a huge jar of pickles they set on your table. Kinda random, but great if you're a pickle lover.

Tips: Fully stocked bar. Knowledgeable staff."}
{"text":"This is one of the most acclaimed french bistros in Montreal and it looks like one has walked into one of the bistros in 1980s. The decor and ambience is exceptionally preserved from that era. 
Having said that, it is not a romantic place- the tables are set too close together, it is a very loud place and the menu choices are very limited and rigid.
This establishment requires reservation and we got a table at 9:30 pm. I hate going to restaurants after 8pm as the servers seem to be exhausted and over worked and it seems like a task to ask them questions about the menu or wine! Plus the best desserts are sold out!!
Anyhow, we were there- shown to our table which was soo close to 2 other tables. We had 3 servers- one to take our order, another to serve and refill bread, butter and pickles ! And another one to get our food. 
There are not many vegetarian or chicken based options here. So we ordered a spaghetti, a soup and a thai cauliflower dish. Lets say, we were hungry and the food was hot and the wine was good!
I have had better food at other places in Montreal and this place just did not cut for me, inspite of all the hoopla!"}
{"text":"I wish I could just focus on the food and move on but this is a review on over all experience. Let me start off by giving you fair warning 'DO NOT go here any later than 10pm' they have literally nothing left on the menu that's available other than the days left overs like  soups, some pasta dishes and basic chicken or fish. If you have your eyes and belly set on the coveted 'marrowbone with sea salt or quail' prepare to be disappointed. 
 
To add insult to injury we had a snobbish, stuck up French speaking waiter who completely ignored our existence. For the first time in a long time I felt like my skin color was to blame and my lack of the French language came in the way anyway I brushed it off but it was enough to make me sit there feeling pretty uncomfortable and disappointed. 

The star of the night was the  creme br√ªl√©e."}
{"text":"L'Express is a staple/classic in Montreal - it's been around since 1979 so you know it's legit when it's been in business for so long. The fact that it's almost always packed and there's always wait says a lot about the restaurant. Their steak tartare is fantastic and so is their steak and frites and bone marrow. Most people return for the experience - the restaurant is known for being really classic and old school, not super modern or pretentious and I think that's what why they have such a loyal customer following. Most new restaurants are hip and trendy whereas  L'Express has always stayed very much the same (food, decor, ambiance) and it's comforting and nostalgic for people to return to something they grew up / are familiar with."}
{"text":"A Classic French Bistro!! Loud inside, but I loved it! It was like a trip to Paris only in N America.

We were on a family vacation, and I remembered an Anthony Bourdain episode where he ate here. I checked the Yelp reviews and made a reservation, which I highly recommend as far in advance as you know.

Everything was wonderful, appetizers, salad, and entrees. A few bottles of wine and a lot of money, but worth it for a true Montreal experience."}
{"text":"One really fine and excellent French bistro! Loved my escargot and steak frites! Get all your French favs here! I loved feeling I was transported over to Europe. It was a fantastic dinner with my boyfriend, super romantic and the best start to our Montreal trip!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to have a meal at L'express after reading all these Yelp reviews. I guess setting my expectation too high left me a little disappointed. 

Making a reservation using Opentable was just so convenient. I was though really surprised  that the restaurant was not busy on a Sunday afternoon. 

But I doubt I going to have what we ordered for lunch regularly as I can feel my arteries clogging up... 

Bone Marrow, Veal Kidney, Croque-Monsieur were all quite heavy and I was ready for afternoon nap after my lunch! Those pickles on the side though was delicious as it helped with my digestion and I just couldn't stop eating those!

Service here was excellent. The deco and vibe is classical French Bistro.

But I just not feeling it... maybe I was just too full after all these eating. Or maybe I should go all the way and order foie gras instead!"}
{"text":"Having lunch here was the highlight of my rainy day. The atmosphere is chic and lively and the food was excellent. The tables by the window would be what I consider the prime seats, as the natural light coming in was very nice contrast against the black & white tiled floors and deep red walls. The beet salad was possibly the best one I've ever had- many different kinds/colors of beets and surprisingly a few carrot and mushroom bits thrown in for fun- but what really delighted me was that the slivers of cheese on top were slightly warmed. The quail over wild rice was very tender, though it could have used some more salt or seasoning (I added). Profiteroles with maple ice cream in creme anglaise was a great end to the meal and didn't feel heavy. All this plus a glass of wine and a cup of tea  felt decadent but fairly priced for what was received."}
{"text":"My first visit for dinner was practically perfect and Sunday brunch did not disappoint either.

Technically, we arrived just after brunch service ended but there were plenty of menu options that worked for a brunch type meal so we were very happy.

Service is swift yet friendly. The decor is great; right out of Paris in the best possible way. I highly recommend making a reservation as they can get very business, especially on weekends.

The house made cornichons are a highlight of any meal here and be sure to peruse the wine menu for some great \"biologique\" options.

While it seems kind of \"hypey\" I'd say that L'Express is still a must try when visiting Montreal, I know I plan to make a visit every chance I get!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Montreal! Love this place. Bone marrow is fantastic and you can even feel the food dancing on your tongue!!! Grilled quail is so good! The wild rice is tasty and the floating island dessert makes a meal perfect ending"}
{"text":"My first night ever in Montreal- of course we need to start our little trip off right with a visit to a French bistro popular with those in the know (obviously I am not talking about myself here.) 
We had reservations for 10 pm and arrived a few minutes late due to a subway glitch. The Maitre d' took our coats and we were seated immediately, and I have to say, we received nothing but excellent service before, during, and after our meal. First of all, we had about three waiters attending to us. Our main guy was patient with me and my lack of knowledge regarding the French language (and everything was spelled out for me in English on an alternate menu as well.) We enjoyed wine and baguette with a-m-a-z-i-n-g butter (I promise to not wax poetic on the butter, but again, AMAZING) while waiting for our meal. Another waiter kept our water glasses full and brought us a mason jar full of gherkin pickles and mustard to enjoy while waiting for our salad. Now I'm sure this is some French bistro custom, but it's like they spied on me while I was snacking by myself one night and made note of it for our upcoming visit. Yummy. 
We ordered the warm goat cheese salad to share, and I ordered the shrimp risotto (with visions of Rachel Z. salivating dancing through my head)  while my boyfriend had the duck confit sauteed over a spinach salad with green beans (or haricot verts, if you will.) Everything was delicious, luxurious, and buttery. Our waiter was absolutely charming and didn't make me feel like a bumpkin (impressive, considering my reaction to the pickles), plus, he had a sense of humor, making a melodramatic show  of reading the menu while my boyfriend entered his tip on the portable debit machine. 
We had the profiteroles for dessert, and while I wasn't wildly impressed with them, it was definitely a solid dessert and the chocolate sauce they came in was delicious. It was a pricier meal but not ridiculous, and certainly worth the money and the freezing trek from the subway. Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed.  I don't even know where to begin.  My initial excitement was quickly squashed right when I walked in the door.  From the reviews I've read on this place and Bourdain's \"The Layover\" highlights on this place, I wasn't going to leave Montreal without eating here.  The hubs and I were hungry enough to eat dinner at 5pm and figured we would probably avoid the dinner rush since we didn't have reservations.  

NO RESERVATIONS (not the Bourdain experience)
Once we stepped foot in the door, the snobby older man (which I saw in all the pictures so he was probably \"somebody\") asked if we had reservations.  When we said \"no\", he gave us a look, flipped through his reservation book, and took his time.  Terrible first impression for customer service.  The phone rang and that's when he started getting irritated with whoever was on the other end of the line trying to change their reservations.  Eventually a shorter older lady came by and asked us if we had reservations.  Again, we said, \"no\".  

IN THE BACK
Eventually they give us a table WAY in the back of the restaurant.  Normally, I don't care about things like that.  However, it was 5pm, and out of the 20+ tables in the front of the restaurant, only two were taken (by two couples).  The table we got in the back of the restaurant was right next to another Asian couple and other 6-8 empty tables.  My guess is that they didn't have a reservation either.  Hm.  The strangest thing is that before we walked into the restaurant, there was a white couple outside the restaurant looking at the menu and deciding on whether they were going to go in.  Eventually they did and my husband's guess was that they didn't have a reservation either.  Guess where they got seated?  YUP - in the front of the restaurant with the other white table.  I will end my rant here and go onto the food and service without making any conclusions.

SERVICE
Once we got seated, no one came to our table for a good 12 minutes.  It got to a point where my husband was going to get ready to leave.  Because he knew I so desperately wanted to eat here, he was willing to stay.  Eventually, the waitress (the older lady from the beginning) came by for our order.  I ordered the Steak Frites and asked for it medium and the hubs the Quiche with salmon and spinach.  About 2 minutes later, the waitress came back and asked how I wanted my steak.  I reiterated that I wanted it medium.  

FOOD
My Steak Frites - Well, it sure wasn't medium.  In fact, it was quite well-done.  There was nearly no sign of any pink in that flank.  I found it ironic that the waitress came back a few minutes after taking my order to see how I wanted my steak cooked.  Apparently it doesn't matter how you order it because you're going to get it well-done.  Thankfully the fries were very good.  That's probably what scored them one star on this review.  The Quiche came out and it was not a salmon and spinach quiche.  In fact, it was mushroom, leeks, and ham in the quiche.  Somehow salmon and spinach must have gotten lost in translation. Thankfully, the quiche was delicious (one more star for them) but the salad accompanying it was drenched and salty.    

OVERALL
I'm sorely disappointed with L'Express on so many levels.  I can't recommend the food or the service.  I understand people say it's a true French dining experience. However, after being in Paris several times, I can't say this was anywhere close to what I experienced in France."}
{"text":"A highlight of my every visit to Montr√©al, L'Express offers a unique combination of excellent food, lively energy, and effortless chic that is unavailable elsewhere in North America. If you need a torchon de foie gras at 2 a.m, look no further."}
{"text":"I've been eating, drinking, and hanging out at L'Express for over 10 years now.

It's my favorite restaurant in Montreal.

Bye now."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to L'Express for our anniversary. Unfortunately, I had hyped it up to a point where we were both slightly disappointed. I had gone before, and remember adoring the ambience, the service and the food. We ordered the mini oysters as an entree and both almost spat them out into our napkins. The oysters tasted and smelled awful! 

The main dishes were good, I had the \"onglet de boeuf au beurre d'√©chalottes\" and my boyfriend ordered the \"confit de canard.\" We both finished our main dishes. The service was fine, nothing over the top. We did end up pouring our own wine a few times, but that doesn't bother me much.

Overall, the restaurant isn't BAD, but nothing compared to what's new and now expected in Montreal's food scene."}
{"text":"Delicious no nonsense french bistro food. If you want a guaranteed satisfactory meal this is the place."}
{"text":"We spent our last night in Montreal at L'express and what a wonderful choice that was!  1) I love the decor! 2) the service was great! 3) the food hit the spot!  
Reading some of the reviews, i can see why diners might not be on the same page.  For me, I really enjoy french food and perhaps that's still a novelty for me.. maybe I'm easily pleased? either way, i did have a wonderful dining experience here~

we got the octopus salad to start.  the portion was very generous! i enjoyed it very much and didn't expect it to be so filling! it also comes with a jar of pickles~ omgggg they were so mini and good! a very good appetizer by itself! 

then i got the special rabbit risotto.  it was delicious! but i can't say that it was phenomenal.  maybe that's the nature of rabbit.. and risotto.   it was a creamy dish.  everything fell into place with no loose ends.  i was holding my stomach by the end of my meal.. on the other hand, my boyfriend got the steak frites and he commented how the portion was smaller than expected and it was just an-ok steak.  guess when it comes to steak, it's still better to order at an american steakhouse lol

so overall, i would give it a solid 4 star.  i would love to return and try other things.  not so sure for my boyfriend though."}
{"text":"Five stars for the young man who brought us bread at least 10 times, cleared plates and brought our food and drinks out in literally seconds. Bravo.
Foie gras, chicken liver and my quail was perfect! Steaks were a bit bland honestly, chewy, undercooked. The experience however, the bread, butter, pickles, drinks - all in all bring this spot to a 5!"}
{"text":"Incredible, incredible, incredible;  everything this place is touted to be.  Our first day in Montreal for my wife's birthday and foodie tour, we went to L'Express for a late dinner.

Cool, small, unassuming place with exceptional service and pure food to die for.  We shared the salmon tartare and sliced octopus salad for appetizers.  They were both amazing.  I had the hangar steak (perfectly cooked meat with crisp fries) and wife had the poached salmon.  One of the highlights of our week."}
{"text":"it was good, the soup I had was a bit too sour, loved the ambiance makes you feel like in a bistro in Paris, would defintely go back again to try the rest of menu."}
{"text":"Such a lovely classy bistro. We were visiting out-of-town and wanted to have french food as our final meal in the city. The service here was great, they were so attentive to us. 

We appreciated the jar of cornichons that you get from the beginning. 

For appetizers, we had the foie gras and the fish soup. I felt like the price of the foie gras did not match up to my expectations - that is my only complaint. 

The highlights were clearly the entrees! We loved the homemade ravioli and the steak tartare with frites. The homemade ravioli was full of flavour, crammed with the veal and mushroom filling. But not too heavy. And the steak was delicious, well balanced. 

And we ended the meal with lemon sorbet which was perfect as well."}
{"text":"What a lovely, lovely restaurant. It somehow tiptoes the line between no-frills and fancy. The fancy is in the menu, which is where it counts the most. They have a very extensive lunch menu, with all of the classics.

We shared the bone marrow between the four of us, and it was delicious. Perfect example of melt-in-your-mouth goodness. They also give you a giant jar of cornichons to snack on, which is nice.

For my entree, I had the quail with dirty rice. It was served with romaine lettuce, so you could make a scoop out of it. The rice was great, but the quail... the quail was was amazing. Five pieces of perfectly cooked poultry.

I also tried my buddy's steak frites, which were also really good. A bit heavy though, but that's to be expected.

This was our last meal in Montreal before heading to the airport, so we moved to the bar to have some coffee before we left. The host (or manager? or owner?) came by and offered us shots of this coffee liqueur in celebration. She did one with us as well. When we asked how much we owed her for the espresso, she told us to just get out of there. Lovely lady.

In terms of going away meals, you'd be hard pressed to find a better option than L'Express."}
{"text":"The perfect Montreal-French bistro. Traveled for the steak frites and haven't stopped thinking about it one week later. The service was impeccable: warm smiling faces enthusiastic to describe a dish if requested in between changing courses with the precision and grace of a jukebox switching between two great records. Wonderful wine list with plenty of bottles between 35-50 as well as dozens of options (even if just to glance at) above that price and half-bottles as well. The steak was tender, well portioned and the pat of shallot herb butter perfect to spread between the grilled crust and crispy fries. We indulged with the maple tart and Quebec apple ice cider to cap of a Monday evening vacation night. Will be our first stop next time we are in the city."}
{"text":"I had read some reviews while in Montreal but didn't intend on coming here until the place we had in mind was actually not close to the Sherbrooke subway stop we got off of (damn you google maps!). So walking up the cute street of St Denis, we decided to come here. Thankfully at 8pm on a Saturday night we were able to get seated within 5 minutes due to the table not having anyone next until 9:15pm. Lucky for us.

The bottle we got was from Chile and was only 21CAD. We looked around and that's what everyone was boozin' off of so we knew it had to be decent. We were sitting in between two of the cutest old couples. One was drooling at my dessert, the other was talking about using the internet to book hotels (nice!). 

For appetizer we got the bone marrow, and it was SO amazingly juicy, fatty, and delicious. Hurt so good. We ordered the chicken in mustard sauce and the duck confit salad. Both were tender and flavorful - consistent delivery. This altogether with the vino made the experience even better. The chocolate tart was rich, but just what I needed to wind down.  The service was great -- had about 3 different guys wait on us throughout the night.

The great thing is that it is open until 3am, you don't see that much. Topped off the night by checking out a jazz club near by. The neighborhood in that area is so cute. So much shopping I wish I could have done! I'll have to come back for more next time."}
{"text":"Peu importe l'heure, le moment, la journ√©e, c'est eeexcellent! Les raviolis aux champignons, coup de foudre."}
{"text":"came here because it was the only place open for dinner at 11:30pm on a Friday that wasn't a fastfood place, but it may very well have been, prices were on par with nice French restaurants but food was straight out of a cafeteria line. would only come back if I were drunk and hungry. thanks to the Canadian-US exchange rate, the damage was less."}
{"text":"Classic old school European restaurant. A lot of tourists but still, I hear, a local institution. Oysters were best I had in my life. The rest were very good but not great: duck, ch√®vre chaud, and saumone tartar. Amazing wine list. Very happy with our meals."}
{"text":"This may not be the best place to eat in montreal, but the preparations are consistent, made from fresh ingredients and flavorful. We wanted to eat characteristically canadian french on our visit and were looking for a delicious lunch. A casual, but elegant restaurant, this place fit the bill. With your meal, you get complimentary cornichons, tart and crunchy, along with warm, well-made french bread. 

Here is what we ate:

Soupe Poisson (fish soup) - thick & flavorful, with a creamy tomato base that complements the seafood flavors, it comes with a side of cheese crusted toast; photo: http://www.flickr.com/photos/bluepupae/3139323889/in/set-72157611620272667/

Brandade - a salty fish & potato puree dip that is great with bread; photo: http://www.flickr.com/photos/bluepupae/3139324637/in/set-72157611620272667/

Country Soup - a hearty vegetable soup with clear broth with lots of flavor, warmth and is good for you too; photo: http://www.flickr.com/photos/bluepupae/3139324939/in/set-72157611620272667/

Croque Monsieur - i didn't try this, but it comes with a salad, and was tasty according to my bf's sister who had it. photo: http://www.flickr.com/photos/bluepupae/3140154790/in/set-72157611620272667/

Lobster Risotto - rich, creamy, delicious with chunks of lobster; photo: http://www.flickr.com/photos/bluepupae/3140155484/in/set-72157611620272667/

Duck Confit w/ salad - moist, seasoned duck meat is balanced by a nicoise type salad of lettuces & green beans and sprinkled with bits of bacon; photo: http://www.flickr.com/photos/bluepupae/3140155842/in/set-72157611620272667/

Cr√®me Caramel √† L'orange -  a flan-like custard in a sweet, light caramel with hints of citrus

Chocolate Tart - rich, dark chocolate; like eating a tart made of truffles

The waitstaff was friendly and not annoyed we spoke english. Then standard menu offers translations in six different languages, and our waitress helped with the specials, which are on an insert."}
{"text":"I had originally envisioned this restaurant to be highlight meal of my Montreal trip.  

While the history and the decor of the restaurant is very nice, the food quality did not live up to the high expectations.  On its own, the food is fine, but not compared to the expectations and reviews.  We had the green salad, the fish soup and the steamed bass.  The soup tasted good.  The steam bass was above average and the presentation of the dish was average.  Maybe the restaurant is better known for their other meat dishes."}
{"text":"I probably won't be adding anything new to what's been said about this place - but wanted to add my two cents.

The steak and frites is to die for!! It's one of those things one MUST try while in Montreal!

This is one of those places where they pay careful attention to detail and everything, from appetizers, to main course to dessert are delightful.

Reservations are essential. Call a couple of days in advance and if you're planning to visit on Saturday - reserve a week prior!.

Can't wait to come back here next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"This place is a classic French bistro on St. Denis that has solid service and food. In terms of value, ambiance, service and food quality this place is a must try when you are in Montreal. Will you be blown away? Probably not. But you will be charmed and satisfied by the food and service. 

Love everything from the bread basket, complimentary cornichons and mustard and the lovely French dishes. Bone marrow is great, their French fries are excellent and I loved the salmon with beurre blanc sauce. Lots of wines to choose at all price points and they serve an excellent port here.

We ordered 2 starters, 2 mains, a bottle of wine and a glass of port and it was all under $175 including a generous tip. We left the place stuffed, a little tipsy and oh so happy."}
{"text":"Great bistro feel, awesome bistro food. Went early with the little one and had a great meal, while she slept. Some highlights - the octopus and lentil salad, liver mousse, sorrel soup to start were all excellent. For main courses, the duck with chanterelles was a hit, as was the house ravioli - which was out of this world. For dessert their l'isle flotant was big enough for 4, but good enough that one could justify eating it. 4 people, 3 courses, 2 nice bottles of wine ~ $350 tip in."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant ever.

We've come to Montreal twice, eaten here twice on both visits, and wherever we travel, we compare every good restaurant to L'Express.

I don't want to hype your expectations, but if you come here, simply expecting a nice meal with good service at a not-so-high price, you will have a good time. You may want to come back again, and you should. Because when you leave Montreal, maybe not the first week after, maybe not the first year after, you may very well find yourself comparing restaurants in your home town - or in other cities you travel - to L'Express.

There are fancier / hipper / I don't know what. If ever a restaurant could make you want to move to a city, L'Express is that restaurant. Because you could afford to eat here regularly, you would want to become a regular, and just the thought makes me want to pack up my life and learn to speak Quebecois! But, like you, I have a real life far off in another city.

So make L'Express your home base while in Montreal. Come for brunch one day, dinner another. If you are so lucky as to have a third meal here . . . TMI alert: I was driving to work a few days ago, steaming about being in traffic, and I remembered that there was the day when I walked up Rue St Denis to L'Express and had lunch. #goodtimes"}
{"text":"This place is reflective of it's namesake - l'express. There's a small list of dishes to choose from so you can quickly decide. Your order will arrive accordingly swiftly. 

They haven't changed their small menu for as long as I can remember but what they do have, they manage to do it well. And it's always pleasant to drop in for a quick bite. Think of a \"diner\" experience with much better and cleaner food that's well put together. Their meats can be overlooked. And that's often the problem when I go. But everything on their menu is solid. Take a look at the menu before you go. If there's anything you're in the mood for, this place is sure to satiate it."}
{"text":"What a great place! My friends and I had dinner here New Years day, and I'm so happy we did! The service was very attentive as well as helpful. Our waiter made a few suggestions before we ordered and they were on point. I started with the bone marrow appetizer and i must say i didn't know what to expect having never had this before. The flavor was sweet, almost smokey. I loved it, but the texture took some getting used to.  For my entree i ordered the steak tartar (another recommendation) and it was phenomenal! Extremely flavorful and an extremely generous portion. I would actually recommend ordering this as an appetizer for the table as i couldn't finish the dish myself. 
      If you make it to Montreal,  this is a must!"}
{"text":"Everything we've had on the menu is excellent. Service is super efficient, and with a smile. The onglet was exactly how I like it. Salads were fresh and delicious. Carpaccio was beautiful and delectable. The quail was succulent, on a bed of wild rice. Desserts did not disappoint. Trying the Ile Flottante with caramel is a must. The chocolate tart (made with 70% from Tanzania) was about the best I've ever had. Lemon tart was smooth, balanced in flavor, and topped with a sumptuous dollop of white chocolate ganache. There's something for every budget on the wine list. Old fashioned French brasserie atmosphere and service in Montreal. Try it, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Best place to eat good late at night - they close at 2am on some days. The Ravioli Mushrooms and the Croque-Monsieur are a must every time. The alcohol prices are pretty amazing also, they about 0.5 times the retail price - which is the best in the city. 

All the deserts are regal, if you lucky enough try the Baba Au Rhum or the Cheesecake."}
{"text":"We came here as a secondary option and very glad we did. At first looking at the menu was a bit intimidating since I am not a French speaker but our waiter gladly presented us with an English version of the menu. 

Eats:
Appetizer - Some sort of mushroom with roasted potatoes and a poached egg on a bed of lettuce. Great start of the meal. The portion was perfect for sharing and all the mixed favors does good on a pallet. 
Entree - Baked quail with Quail eggs and wild rice.....delicious. The quail was perfectly cooked, quail egg was a good touch and the wild rice was just cooked al dente 
Dessert - Floating island which is a caramel shell on caramel sauce with a side of honey roasted almonds.....this was good but I would try something else next time. Presentation is nice but nothing special with the dessert. 

Likes:
- service was excellent. The staff is very friendly and for the non French speakers they are willing to translate anything you have in question. 
- side of sour pickles was a good touch
- big wine menu with about 4 different types of beer to try

Dislikes:
- this is being picky but the house bread would be better warm

Overall I am glad we came here. It was nice they close at 12am for your late night option."}
{"text":"We got the \"steak\" tartar and the duck fois gras and it was not what we expected. The steak was actually minced beef. We sat at the bar as this restaurant needs reservation"}
{"text":"Spectacular service and atmosphere. Food was great and they have an excellent wine list. Prices were reasonable for a restaurant like this.

Pro tip: MAKE A RESERVATION. They will immediately turn you away if you try to walk in. We went on a Sunday night and there were still a lot of people waiting to be seated after 10pm. A man came in with his wife, the maitre d asked if he had a reservations and upon hearing no said, \"Absolutely not, good night.\" That's all you'll get if you don;t make a reservation."}
{"text":"Service was lovely, fantastic food. I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the place."}
{"text":"This was my first experience ever eating real French food so I can't say I know a whole lot about the subject. However I am sure that many people are in the same situation and are unknown on what to expect.

I came here with my husband (made reservations of course) and was very worried about his meat and potatoes attitude. Due to that we skipped an appetizer much to my disappointment. I had the saut√©ed duck confit salad and he had the homemade raviolis. My dish was good, didn't quite blow me away I think there wasn't enough flavor or variety to it. However the homemade raviolis came out and my husband looked at them like \"what the f*** is this\" because it wasn't Italian.  However one bite quickly changed his mind as they were melt in your mouth good. A little salty for the dish.

If I had known there there was a counter I would've requested a table in our reservation but the best English speaking employee the bartender who was very nice was there. 

Again to my disappointment my husband made me skip dessert so our meal came out quite cheap. I would say if you are sitting at the counter it's definitely a more casual vibe but at the tables it seemed a bit more upscale. 

Can't wait to come back on our next visit and get an appetizer and dessert in!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

TL;DR: Decent place to visit while in Montreal, good for a small plate bite. Decent for groups/dates. Reservation recommended! (just seems like the norm in any French restaurants in Montreal)

Is it just me or I felt like there has not been any single bad dining place in Montreal? L Express is no exception - although this is not a necessarily a 5 star place to eat yet even the less than stellar restaurants actually are pretty good. It's just one of those things with French sophistication - the standard bars are pretty high across the board.

Managed to visit this place during one of our restaurant hopping in Montreal the past thanksgiving. We tried to come without reservation on one of the weeknights around 8ish and we were told that they had no place until 10 PM, so we decided to take place our names down and hung out at different place in the meantime.

So when we came back, we have already had some bites by then..so my friends and I decided to share shrimp risotto and the homemade raviolli! Food came out pretty quick, the shrimp risotto actually turned out not to be my favorite dish (2 out of 5), texture was a little off as the rice was more solid/starchy than more like a porridge consistency. And the vegetables inside it were still a little tough. The homemade ravioli  with mushroom was a totally different story. it probably was one of the best mushroom raviolis I ever had anywhere. The gravy that was part of the dish elevated the dish to another level. (5 out of 5). Another thing was that the portion was a little too small than my liking. It probably was for the better that we did have a small bite before coming here. 

So there you have it. Average rating = 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Out concierge was supposed to make a reservation but didn't.  Restaurant accommodated us but maitre d made sure to tell us that we did not have a reservation.  Seems like restaurant was more attentive to Upper East side NYC customers than us.   Food was just ok.  Our waiter only came to take our order and and bring the check.  Very disappointed.   Terrible end to a fun trip."}
{"text":"Exactly what you want in a bistro. The staff is superb. Sitting at the bar is a genuine pleasure."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to L'Express for dinner during our visit to Montreal. This place was highly recommended by our friends. 
We made a reservation the same day and were seated promptly. I liked the ambiance in here. The servers are definitely hustling and working hard but I found them to be very friendly, attentive and professional. 
We ordered the Duck tartare, the ravioli, quail and the floating island dessert. All the dishes were delicious- each dish was seasoned well and was very comforting after a long day of exploring the city. 
Overall a pleasant dining experience and perfect for date! Would return again."}
{"text":"with a handwritten menu, this place has all the charm and bustle of a real french bistro.

be sure to be adventurous and try out their specialities.

my father and i enjoyed the following at lunch:

1. the roasted bone marrow - topped with a delicate lettuce leaf, each selected bone was a different height.  
2. the mustard celery was fantastic!!!! thinly sliced and \"pickled\" with mustard, i devoured this right up.
3. the veal kidneys with mushroom and house potatoes were excellent!  rich and filling.  this is a must try.
4. the veal liver with perfect fries and homemade mayo is not for the faint of heart.  this was quite a generous portion.  it would be something that i normally would not try but now, i would order it in a second.  the dish was packed full of flavor!

for dessert, we enjoyed a giant but light serving of the floating island - a lovely confection of whipped eggwhites with a sugar caramel crust topped with almond slices and floating on a sea of english cream.  it was the best one that i have ever sampled even compared to all the restos in paris.

fast and friendly service, this is a definite stop for anyone - local or just visiting.  be sure to look around as you may spot a local celebrity or two."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is amazing!!!! There was not a single thing that wasn't great! Recently went on a trip up to Montreal with a few friends and we decided to have a nice dinner and chose this place. So glad we did. If you are in the city, this is a must go to! Now onto the food.

Apps - 
Foie gras- I know this is controversial plate but wow. This was the best tasting foie gras I had and I had foie gras in Paris to compare. 

Bone marrow- I typically like the bone marrow that is broiled to have that crispy crust but this was still decadent and delicious

Octopus- if I had to choose, this was probably my least favorite ofthe three but still good nonetheless! 

Entree-

Quail- sooo so soooo good! Whatever the sauce was, it was amazing and the quail was so moist. The wild rice underneath also have a nice addition due to the texture. Everyone said they loved my dish the best

Steak tartar- this was also so good! Most steak tartar I've had, I feel like the ingredients they add overpower the steak a bit but this place it was perfect. Nothing over powered the flavor of the meat and it was nice and light and delicious 

Steak and frites- the steak was also on par with the fries. If you're not with group and great to try a bit of everything, I'd recommend going for another dish since steak and fries can be done elsewhere. 

Dessert

Originally my group wasn't planning to get dessert since we were stuff but the waiter brought out this amazing dish on the house! ( service was also amazing here. So friendly and knowledgeable) the outer crust was so sweet and delicious. Not sure what the inside was but it was nice and light. 

Next time I'm in down I am definitely stopping by this place again!"}
{"text":"Should have noticed before choosing this place based on the Yelp reviews... that all but one on the first page was from a tourist. It was decent. Period. Not good or bad. Basic French staples done adequately. But every single person near us was a tourist. This isn't Paris people. If it were this place would be simply average among hundreds. We wanted a unique, local experience. This is an \"I couldn't afford a vacation to Paris but I still want to feel like I ate at an average bistro in the 1st arr. I should have interpreted Yelp more dutifully."}
{"text":"Un incontournable montr√©alais!!! Tout est bon et le service est toujours de haute qualit√©."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've ever had. Try the quail, and don't forget dessert."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant with good food at fair prices. Love their pickles! The atmosphere is nice. Although their servers can come off not very approachable/friendly."}
{"text":"Great place to eat French cuisine.  We came to Montreal for great food and dinner, this place did not disappoint. I had hunger steak with fries and my wife got steak tartar and we both enjoyed  our food very much. Pleasant and professional personal. When we were there it was busy, we called ahead and made reservation, I advice you do the same to make sure you get seated right away. Will to here again next time I visit Montreal."}
{"text":"It was a lovely evening out here. The service was impeccable and attentive, and the food quite good. Wine is less expensive than other restaurants we tried, and the menu overall is reasonable (plates for $20-$30). We loved the gherkins and dijon mustard at the table, and the atmosphere was cozy. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is an institution in Montreal in the french brasserie category, in fact it is one of the oldest (-+ 30 years).  The decor is great with it's high ceilings in a great french burgundy color, and a long bar, the front is all window, which let's in a lot of natural light and provides a view onto St Denis
.
The service here is top notch, very french so everything is quite smooth and attentive, it does have a touch of the old school snobyness at times, but generally speaking this is not a bad thing, they are not condencending just quite correct and maybe too formal.

The food is hit or miss for me, I will simply tell you what I really liked on my last visit
Os a Moelle, (it's a little pricey but if you have never tried this, do yourself a favor and start here), the fish soup is also very good and has a nice balance of flavors, on this last visit, (feb29,2012), I sample the octopus, which was boiled (as per waiter, which had me worried but I still ordered it), it was very tender to the taste and served over lentils, with onions and a vinegrette, a big winner. A goat cheese salad with endives followed and it was ok but nothing special, then a steak tartare, here we had a miss.  For me the texture (seriously ground to a mash), was so unappealing, and the flavors were too mild, barely anything other than capers, at 24$ with a choice of fries or mashed, this was the big let down.  
On the other hand the wines are great, they get all private imports which is ideal, we samples a gigondas 2008, costing 58$ that was very appreciated.

I have in the past been here for breakfast, which is rather limited but always good, it is not for those looking for bang for you buck or to fill up, but it is a very pleasant atmosphere.

They have really long hours and are often opened until 1-2am so if your looking for some quality noche, after hours this is a great alternative to crap food usually available at this time of night."}
{"text":"In short, go to L'Express. French-style bistro cuisine in a clean, bright, and bustling (but not too lively) atmosphere. The octopus salad and the profiteroles were immaculate!"}
{"text":"L'Express provided an incredibly delicious and authentic French dinner. Everything that they brought to the table was delicious, including the steak tartare, octopus salad, and pot au fue. By far, my favorite dish was the shrimp risotto - if you like risotto, I highly recommend ordering this. A nice surprise was that the servings were a good size - my dinner partner and I both felt full after eating only an entree.

Additionally, the environment is very cozy, with wonderfully attentive service, and very fair prices. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"It was our last night in Montreal and we were really trying hard to find a nice place to eat...especially since the night before, we had the worst dining experience in years and years at Le Grille.  So we wanted some redemption.  We decided on L'Express.  What a great decision.  We walked in a little before 8 pm and the place was full.  The manager told us that they were booked with reservations and that we couldn't get a table until 10 pm or we could sit at the bar until 9 pm when another reservation was coming.  The manager was very polite and definitely accommodating given how busy it was that night.

The bartender greeted us warmly and was very attentive, even though the bar was completely full at this point.  We told him that we only had until 9 pm and then we had to give up the seats and he assured us not to worry and to enjoy our night.  We ordered a wonderful goat cheese salad, followed by hanger steak and roasted quail, both of which were fantastic.  Wonderful flavors throughout.  As we were finishing our wine, another bartender offered us the dessert menu, but since they did not have an English translation of that menu, he offered his help and explained the desserts to us.  We were both very impressed with how the bartenders were so kind and helpful.  

At this point, it had reached 9 pm and we thought we should leave but they assured us that it was no problem to have dessert so we did.  The chocolate dessert was absolutely wonderful.  We never felt rushed and we had a great experience.  

We would definitely go back next time.  And I would even rather sit at the bar then at a table."}
{"text":"One of the best establishments ive ever eaten at.  Living in NYC you think you know good food.  Not true until you have come to Montreal.  
Here we sat at the bar, had 100% top of the line service.  
We the octopus lentil salad which was outstanding.  Followed by the bone marrow, beautiful and rich, served piping hot.  Then on to steak frittes and followed with profitterioles.  Oh and a goat cheese salad.  
Everything was simple yet somehow elegant.  For instance they make there own mayo and the salt they use is grey celtic sea salt.  Also you are given fine olive oil at the table.  The little touches like fresh OJ  as a mixer in our drinks..  
Living in NYC there are many nice places to dine.  Lately it feels that your eating from a central kitchen with all the chefs being from Mexico city or something.  There is no authenticity anymore.  But here in Montreal true real french food is cooked by the french.  What a concept!  Italian food cooked by real Italians.  Bring it on.  Bring it all on.  
L' Express like many other great restuarants in Montreal have no outside signs indictating where you are eating and if you dont know exactly where it is you will not find it so get the address.  
Like i said the simple unspoiled elegance of this \" fast good food\" place is superb.  On weekends or early make sure you have reservations or you will wait a long time.  If its just 2 of you then reserve at the bar, the service is excellent and the seats comfortable.  
I love Montreal, what a beautiful city and wonderful people.  This place just puts the icing on the cake.  Moderate in priced too."}
{"text":"I love coming here with my family. This place just screams authenticity as a French bistro. 

Food: not once have we found something we didn't enjoy here. The food is simply fantastic. Be warned though, it's rather heavy and we sometimes have trouble unless we share appetizers.

Service: the staff is very kind and professional. Service is also fast and they were very accommodating with a last minute reservation too.

Price: more expensive than most meals but you're paying for quality here. It's definitely worth it.

Ambiance: I love how classy and authentic this place is. It has an old school vibe that's reflected in both the cuisine, and design."}
