{"text":"I don't know why this place isn't more busy than it is. It's delicious pasta. The gnocchi is mouth-watering and reminded me of the kind of dishes I ate in Florence. Like in Italy, Divino is about quality over quantity, so North Americans accustomed to large greasy portions may not like this place. It's filling without being gluttonous. The best part is that it's FREE corking Sunday-Thursday nights, so it makes for an affordable evening out. And the patio is one of the best on Yonge Street."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Last time I went I had the Mediterranean Chicken which was very nicely cooked and season.

A very spacious and tastefully decorated space - great for larger parties!"}
{"text":"A nice small restaurant just south of Yonge & St. Clair. Went here for lunch with a couple friends on a Friday afternoon. We were the first to arrive and luckily we beat the lunchtime rush because 20 minutes later the place was full and you would not have been able to find a seat!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Excellent and friendly service. Great bread and olive oil with spices.  Very tasty mussels. Even our 9 year olds loved it.  Main meal was fantastic. Well worth the trip out!"}
{"text":"Great service, very friendly, we were seated right away, greeted at our table quickly, water was kept full, food came quickly, and the server was nice. The food was ok, but not fabulous. The cannoli and pasta du mar were better than the veal piccata and spaghetti marinara. 

Nice atmosphere, well decorated, good volume on the music."}
{"text":"Amazing food with great flavor. Was in Montreal on business and our team ate here at least 5 times."}
{"text":"I have tried this restaurant once a while back and I don't remember being too crazy about it. The appetizers were cold (when they should've been hot) and the food wasn't that great."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times (not by choice) and 2 out of the three times I really disliked it. I found the food to be totally tasteless both times. 

Service is ok and prices are fine, but there's something off about this restaurant. Although their bread is amazing and portions are large, everything else sort of sits at a mediocre level. I don't really recommend Divino given that there are tons of great Italian restaurants in the city!"}
{"text":"This was the best meal I've had here and the Osso Bucco was to die for!
The service was great.  Friendly, engaging and very efficient.
I enjoyed the Cesar salad.  Nice size and very crisp lettuce.  The bread and dipping oil was okay.  The bread was nice and fresh but it had been left on the grill a tad too long and was a little charred.  As stated, the Osso Bucco was excellent.  Full of flavour, so so tender.  The sauce was excellent and I wanted to lick the plate!  Very good sides of garlic mashed and a vegetable medley.
First rate meal that I would definitely order again.
Interesting if you order a steak you can get a side salad for $2.95.  I think the most expensive steak is about $30.  The Osso Bucco is $34 but they don't offer the same deal; however if you ask nicely they were more than kind to make the offer.  Nicely done!"}
{"text":"Bofff.... Grand restaurant qui n'a sa raison d'être que pour des diners d'affaires (du  moins, selon moi)  Pour moi l'endroit est une façade. Je m'explique, la déco est classique, le menu semble bien, les serveurs sont tous sur leur 36 mais il manque quelques choses. Les plafonds haut font que l'endroit est bruyant, les plats servis sont au mieux insipides (je suis certain que les légumes sont congelés et non frais), au pire mauvais et le service est maladroit et ininspiré. Bofff...."}
{"text":"This was a good solid Italian eatery.  I ordered a New York Strip, which came out overcooked.  The mashed potatoes were bland.  The sautéed veggies were good. The soup was a wonderful chicken vegetable.  The bread was excellent.  The coffee was outstanding.  The service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Divino is located at the old Terroni location on Balmoral just South of St. Clair on Yonge. There is a covered patio outside for the summer months.

They lost one star for not returning my call for reservations.  I called at 10am and clearly they don't check their messages and as I was trying to make a same day reservation, by about 2pm I called again and they took down my reservation.

Upon arriving we were promptly seated by the host - who also ended up serving us. We were served by about 3 different people as clearly the working environment is just as casual as the dining experience I had.

I came with Karl R. in tow and we were seated at the patio.  We started off with Cosmopolitan and Limoncello Martinis.  The bread basket showed up sometime after. When I asked the server what the chunks of orange in my bread were she said \"I'm not sure actually. I think sundried tomato?\". No explanation of what tapenade accompanied the bread was given either.  The Olive and \"Sundried Tomato\" bread was quite good. Perfectly crusty on the outside and soft in the centre. The tapenade was also quite tasty. I would pass on the plain Italian Bread unless you're just really hungry!

For starters we got the Grilled Spice Rubbed Calamari with Cajun Tomato Salsa, Gaeta Olives and Balsamic Vinaigrette.  This is perhaps one of the best grilled calamari dishes I've experienced so far.  It was grilled to perfection and the tomato salsa had a nice sweet and sour tang to it which was balanced with the salty olives.  Yummy!

Karl R. got perhaps the most difficult dish on the menu to pronounce... Casareccia served with a homemade spicy Italian sausage, rapini, garlic, red peppers, parmesan and fine olive oil.  This, by the way, was a pasta dish. The pasta was a spiral pasta and was cooked al dente.  However, I noticed that toward the end of Karl's meal that there was a WHOLE LOT of oil in that pasta dish!  

I opted for the Seared Striped Bass served with Scallion Lemon Tomato Herbed Olive Oil, Market Vegetables (Asparagus, Broccolini & Green Beans) and roasted potatoes.  The bass was nicely seared.  It had a crisp skin but the fish was moist and tender.  I will warn though that if you are not a fan of fish bones, that this is not the fish for you!  It was not overly bony, but there were a few bones here and there.  The potatoes were tasty as were the vegetables.  

We decided to skip dessert as Karl loves to spend his time in coffee shops.  

All in all, I would say that you get good value for your money.  The food is tasty albeit the service being a tad casual.  Their prices are on par with what you would pay at Moxies or Milestones, although the ingredients they use are definitely of better quality.  I would come back to Divino again if I was in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"The restaurant offerings in Ville St-Laurent are pretty limited, so my husband and I visit this little Italian place a couple of times a month, often before heading next door for a movie.

My husband starts with the mussels marinara and although the marina sauce is always deliciously flavorful, the size & quality of the mussels is very inconsistent.  Once in a while he'll luck out and get large, tasty mussels, but most of the time they are small and many of the shells are empty.   My starter of choice is a tomato & bocconcini salad.  Note that this is NOT listed on the menu, but if you ask your server for it, they will happily make it for you.  They overdo the greens on the plate, but it's pretty hard to screw up tomatoes & cheese, so I usually don't have any complaints ;-)

What I do have an issue with is the stale bread that they bring to the table with the dipping oil.  They try to disguise the staleness by serving the bread warm, but if you let it sit for a couple of minutes it hardens into something more akin to a brick than a bun.  Two of our past three visits we could not even bite into the bread - the third time I didn't want to risk my teeth by trying...

When it comes to the main course, they do redeem themselves.  I tried a variety of the main dishes, but once I discovered the chicken avocado I knew I had found the winner.  This grilled chicken breast (skin & bone in) is cooked to perfection with a delicious creamy sauce that makes it melt in your mouth and topped with a perfectly ripe 1/2 avocado.  I have never had such tender and juicy chicken before.  It is served with mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables which are...  meh... I've never been a fan of grilled & soggy eggplant, zucchini or peppers.  My husband usually has the grilled trout, served with rice and steamed vegetables.  Luckily he IS a fan of the grilled veggies that come with my main dish, so we swap those out and are both happy.  

Service is always courteous and quick - and we now have a regular server who we really like (ask for Lipon, he'll treat you great!), so that always makes the experience more pleasant.  The restaurant is never crowded, which makes the atmosphere quiet and relaxing.  If only the kitchen could be a little more consistent I would have rated it 4-stars, but since it's really a hit or miss with the food, I had to give it a three."}
{"text":"The tomato sauce they use for the pasta is terrible, ewww, went there for a business get together only because of it's proximity for all parties involved. The previous time I had been there was in 2004, I knew there was a reason I had skipped it for so long."}
{"text":"My client took me here for lunch. We had a combo plate for appetizer, it came with a cheese dip and an assortment of Italian favourites, much too big for two people but I am not complaining. The main was a seafood pasta one of the best. Flavourful sauce with large fresh seafood. The portion was dinner size, and I finished half, a complete credit to how good it was. Actually had to undo my pants button. The restaurant was packed with weekday lunch crowds, mostly office workers nearby. The staff handled the rush effortlessly. This restaurant is quite far from downtown but I dare say that the locals know what is best and by my personal experience and the fact that it is always packed, it is worth coming all this way...."}
{"text":"Divino***- 3 and a half, but can't rate that so its a 3.

Went here for lunch because I was going to be in the area and found a voucher online the day before :D

There was four of us eating and 3 not eating sitting on a really nice patio with a roof. Had to wait a bit for one friend but still had a problem getting the waitstaff's attention a few times, probably because we were there exactly at 11;30 when they opened (i had a packed schedule for 1pm-5pm) so they were no where to be found after drinks were ordered until other patrons started showing up... the lunch business crowd.

We ordered:
$13.95 meat and cheese board
Salami, prosciutto, another cured meat, 3 types of cheese, some pear slices and olives. Was ok for $14 we expected a bit more, 3 thin slices of each meat and 2 of each cheese.
$6 Caesar salad
Was larger in size then we expected and was comfortably shared among the four of us.
$15 smoked chicken jalapeno pizza
Was kind of bland, but the jalapenos gave it a bit of a kick.
$14.95 parpadella steak pasta
This we ate after the pizza because we didn't want soggy pizza, after 10 minutes the pasta had stuck together and formed a ugly looking jelly paste. We had to really toss it and pull it apart for us to eat it. It was covered in oil and also didn't have much flavor. Mushrooms kind of saved it a bit.
$7 organic mill st beer- husband said it was good.

A side of bread, which we had refilled came with this amazing red pepper hummus dip of some sorts which was very yummy, not too salty but with the crusty bread it went really well. 

Overall
Prices are cheap for environment and Italian food.
Next to the fire station- but didn't bother me that much, apparently my husband heard all the sirens...
At the end when we were trying to head out (like i said packed day) we waved down the manager after 10 minutes of no one in sight, the restaurant/patio was full at this point. We asked for the bill and he brought it but when we tried to give him money he said \"She will come by and do it after\" we said huh? if he was right there why couldn't he take it? About 10 minutes later the \"she\" came by... threw us off a bit! It would have been a 3 1/2 star but this manager made it easier to rate on yelp with that incident.
I would come here again if I was in the area even without the voucher but wouldn't make the drive otherwise."}
{"text":"Background
I've been here before years ago and it felt like the quality went down.  I came here for lunch and I was hoping it would have good quality as when I was here for dinner once before.

Food 2/5
The ceasar salad was amazing.  It was a decent size appetizer that came with the lunch entree.  The bread and olive oil mix was great.  What brought the rating down was the veal entree.  It tasted bland.  It looked like they cooked the veal separately and then added the gravy as a topping.  The gravy taste was also tasteless.  It tasted like it was a dumbed down version of a beef stew.  If they cooked the meat in the stew, it would have tasted better.  I also ordered the Creme Brulee.  It was a little too liquidy.  The consistency wasn't wet but it did taste good.

Service 5/5
The host was friendly.  The waitress was very helpful and was pretty attentive.  She was cute too.

Ambiance 4/5
It's definitely a popular business lunch spot.  The place became full around noon and the conversations were bearable."}
{"text":"The bread basket (well, more of a bread platter) had a nice mix between Italian bread and a kind of nut/tomato/olive loaf. 

Started with the aforementioned calamari, grilled not deep fried. It was covered in a kind of rich sauce and I could have easily eaten 3 servings.

I had the casarecci pasta with spicy Italian sausage. It was a spicy dish but not overpoweringly so. 

Service was great, decor was great, there's a sunken patio that I think I might prefer if it gave you a better street view. My only issue with Divino is it's not cheap."}
{"text":"I have been here several times since I used to work nearby. They serve warm bread with olive oil dip as a free appetizer. I am a huge fan of the avocado chicken. Great big portions and I found the pizzas as well to be super tasty. Definitely worth passing by!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent service by Sam was terrible. He disappeared for long periods of time and was rude to my wife when she struggled with the credit card machine. Ordered cocktails that sat at the bar for a long period of time had to ask the hostess to get them to us"}
{"text":"Six of my coworkers and I had lunch at Divino today.  It is in the old Terroni space (I'm not a fan of Terroni) and opened in April.

We ordered appetizers.  The bruschetta was fresh and the cured meat/world cheese appetizer seemed to be enjoyed.

There is quite a selection of interesting pizzas and pastas.  We all ordered pizzas.  I went mainstream and ordered the pepperoni pizza.  Others at the table had ingredients like shrimp, peppers, chicken, mushroom, walnuts, olives, etc. on their pizzas.  My pizza was good.  Along with the pizza, we could have olive oil or chilli olive oil as condiments.

The servers were friendly and a lot of fun.  They were very attentive and made sure we had lots of water and pop."}
{"text":"I will have to disagree with all of the negative reviews, i have been here several times and every time it was FANTASTIC! It's a fancy spacious italian restaurant that gives a warm welcome and you feel well taken care of by great italian waiters I suspect. I loveeeee the all you can eat AYCE mussels option from Monday to wednesday! They have two different options with marinara or lemon flavoured mussels. It was so delicious. They always prepare it perfectly and the service is spectacular. I always leave here in an awesome mood. They really care to please and offer quality and value for your money. The prices are very affordable. The service is splendid. When ever I come they seat me right away and have the menu out and ready. They don't take long at all to prepare my food. Their frozen drinks are delicious. I always get the piña colada and its SWEET!!! 

Their food is always fresh and ready in a jiffy. 
I recommend this place 100% and its an awesome place to take someone on a date after you've just finished watching a movie. The guzzo is right beside this restaurant . They have great seating and tvs to watch your favourite sports channels which also may get very entertaining.

Overall, the best service, food and atmosphere. Love love love it and definitely coming back soon 
100% recommend"}
{"text":"We were seated quickly, on a Saturday evening. The linguini bolognese I ordered was good enough but not stellar. Liked their Gorgonzola-infused caeser dressing for the salad a lot. My friend's Gnocchi in the cream sauce was quite delicious. 

Overall - Good service, decent food. Has a nice neighborhood vibe.Worth a visit if you're in the neighbourhood but no need to go out of your way for it..."}
{"text":"My rating is 2.5 stars, but I will round down.

I still have a number of reviews to do when I was in Montreal in early September. I was there to train a few colleagues. I suppose that is what happens when work gets in the way. I end up having a fair number of reviews to do.

My first workday was Tuesday, the day after Labour Day. I had a good day training them on our writing application and the writers were friendly. 

My boss decided to call a meeting at 5 pm that day. Note that I had been at the office for eight hours already and was hungry. Of course, the three men on the teleconference, including my boss, could not wrap up a thirty-minute meeting. Instead, they were still at it at 6:30 pm. I was not impressed and said that I needed to cut this discussion short. I cannot concentrate when I am hungry. I also don't appreciate folks who cannot get to the point.

So, I drove over to Divino, which was a restaurant close to my hotel. This restaurant is by the movie theatre in which I paid $5 for a matinee over a year ago. It helps that I knew that there were restaurants around me.

I parked and then walked into the restaurant. It wasn't busy. I was quickly seated at a table. I ordered a Diet Coke, the bolognese ragu, and tiramisu for dessert.

My bolognese ragu was essentially spaghettini with a soupy tomato sauce consisting of ground beef. The pasta was done well. I didn't like the sauce. I remember leaving what looked like soup and fishing out the ground beef.

For dessert, I had the tiramisu. It was okay. I love tiramisu. It's my favourite dessert. I have had much better.

I thank the restaurant for making my stomach stop growling. Perhaps I will come back and try the risotto with mushrooms. I am hoping that I do better with that dish than the bolognese ragu.

{"text":"Restaurant correct. Le risotto aux courges et poulet est vraiment excellent. Le service est un peut lent. L'ambiance en est plutôt une de rencontres d'affaires. Sinon le service est bien mais discret, ce n'est pas ce qui se démarque le plus. Sinon, nous n'avons manqué de rien, juste qu'à part le risotto, ça ne se démarque pas outre mesure."}
{"text":"Thinking about it now makes me so hungry. You know a place is exceptional when you eat there once and dream of going back there.  Divinos' pasta dishes and pizza are absolutely delicious. You can tell the pasta is fresh and the sauces handmade. I've tried four of their dishes now. All amazing. I felt a wave of melancholy during my final bites. Didn't want the meal to end! 

The space itself is huge and engaging with very high ceilings. It's decorated simply but strike a clear note as a modern Italian kitchen. Lots of space between seats so it doesn't feel crowded even on a  reasonably busy night. If you seek and utterly authentic, professionally prepared food with the warmest of experiences I highly recommended you try this place."}
{"text":"Nice menu, great service.. a little more on the pricy side.. good for grabbing lunch with collègues or taking someone for a date in vsl area... helpful waiters and waitresses for making the right choice or food and wine pairing"}
