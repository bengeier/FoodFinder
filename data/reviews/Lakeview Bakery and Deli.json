{"text":"Wow! Lots of sandwich options and all their salads looked good. I got the Bangkok Pork with a pasta crab salad and a small cookie. All for $8!!! The sandwich was so juicy that I lost all the juice to the bag while walking back to the other side of the square. I couldn't finish the whole sandwich."}
{"text":"Awesome food, generous portions in the lunch box specials....not to mention the fresh homemade bread. Worth the drive.....I'll for sure go again!  :-)"}
{"text":"Poor service (?) great food.  Went to Lakeview with a coworker for lunch yesterday and the food was awesome, I plan to go back one day and grab one of their delicious-looking (whole) loaves of bread (which are surprisingly inexpensive).   Gotta say though, the service was pretty bad. Both the cashier and the girl who brought our food (to-go) to us managed to get through the entire transaction without even a hint of a smile. Their menu is extensive, and spread across multiple expo boards. I love the variety and the authentic feel, but part of what goes along with that is increased thinking time. My coworker and I had never been there before, we didn't know the ropes, no one else was in the store, so we asked a couple of simple questions \"what is included in the lunch box? what salad and sandwich list can we pick from?\" and were met with our questions answered, albeit feeling as if we were a huge inconvenience. Unfortunately, I cannot even say they at least got my order right, because they forgot the most important part of my meal: my big, chocolate chip cookie.   However, one of the cooks there happened to walk by to stock something in the front counter, and was more informative and gracious to my coworker's questions than I would have ever expected. He seemed genuinely happy to be there, and perfectly natural and knowledgeable when it came to talking to us.   My coworker went back to Lakeview today, and merely mentioned to this same cook that my cookie had been forgotten yesterday, and the guy threw it in, no problem, no charge, no questions asked. Whether it was for reasons of good customer relations, or because this is not the first time an order has been misplaced, I don't know, but I will absolutely go back because of this one guy, and because of the great food, and the great location."}
{"text":"I live a 30 second walk from lake view deli,  but unfortunately was not able to try it for weeks - it isn't open on the weekends. When we finally made it back around 4 one day, we ran over to the corner where lake view resides.  After making some hard decisions, my group tried a myriad of options. I went with the cubano which came crisp and stuffed in a grilled flour tortilla. Man, was it good. Other members of the party went for the box combo and tried the cookies - all the sandwiches got rave reviews. They also have a good assortment of vegetable/potato/pasta salads.  I really wish I could go here on the weekends or that it were open a bit later, but maybe that could happen in the future."}
{"text":"We love this little deli. Unfortunately, it's only open on week days. Lots of great sandwiches, soups, salads, beer and sweets to pick from. We only live a block a way so it's a true bummer we need to get there on weekdays when i commute to the west side for work. Also, this place is super affordable. For two people, we usually spend $20. Super cheap for Madison. We love you Lakeview Deli!"}
{"text":"The employees here are awesome! The food, even better! I especially love their breakfast sandwiches! The cookies and pastries are really good too. Try their Litebox lunch or the Lunchbox items. Comes with either a half sandwich or whole sandwich and a choice of many sides."}
{"text":"I've come here regularly for their Gyro Special on Tuesdays. One of the best! Ingredients taste so fresh. Love the staff! Great place to stop in for lunch for a great price."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Really.  Because I'm always hungry and will officially be an attorney in 2 days, I'm going to call myself Hungry Attorney II.  I don't know if it's their reasonably-priced, god-awfully delicious sandwiches or the outrageously cheap, fresh breads for $1.75 (today's was a habanero cheese that easily blows away Stella's), but this really is a place no one should visit. Ever.  I'm pretty much copying the other reviewer, but stay away from this gem. Its deliciousness should continue to go unnoticed, so I can enjoy short lines and chat time with the bakers.  Awesomeness."}
{"text":"The most fresh and delicious sandwich I have ever had in my life, with the most friendly staff. If you love in Madison and do not frequent this lunch spot, you're missing out."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast pastries and sandwiches. Staff is very friendly. Ambiance is comfortable. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very good deli in cool location near the lake.  The lunchbox special is a must. Very good fresh sandwiches and friendly staff. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My not-so-secret, secret lunch spot might be the best deal in Madison!  The lunchbox special is an absolute must. $7.50 gets you one of LVD's enormous made-to-order sandwiches (including any of the numerous daily special sandwiches named for celebrities who have a birthday on the day of the special); a side salad; and choice of chips, cookie or soda. The deal is absurd.  You might avoid the coffee, but the fresh baked goods are top notch. Please read this review and never go to the Lakeview Deli so it can remain my little secret..."}
{"text":"Visiting from San Francisco and stopped in for lunch based on a recommendation. Food was outstanding. Very fresh and healthy.  Has the tarragon chicken salad was excellent. The soup special of the day was also amazing (chicken quinoa)!"}
{"text":"Excellent and daily wide assortment of scratch-prepared pastries, salads and sandwiches. Very good coffee. Super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this spot isn't more popular. It is small, cute, and everything is homemade and de-licous.   I happened in one afternoon and their special was a meatball sub. Now, this isn't my normally my jam, but it was a chilly afternoon and I was starving so I went for it.   Seriously? Best meatball sub ever. The bread was amazing. The meatballs were tender and flavorful. The marinara was super fresh tasting. Add to all of this the fact that I had a delicious side salad and a super yummy cookie and they have themselves a return customer.   I have been back a few times since then and other sandwiches have been equally delicious, with the salads being the only weak point, but I will give them a pass on that because the sandwiches are so huge that I rarely make it to the sides anyway.   This is definitely a top notch lunch spot. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I've been here only a few times. This establishment is in close proximity to where I work occasionally, and i have stopped for the purpose of 1. Something hot to drink 2. To buy a bakery item to fix a sweet craving 3. For a quick lunch. I'll touch on #1 first. My coffee shop of choice was under renovation, and it was 7:30 a.m., and effing cold. I needed something hot to drink and to hold. I stopped in to Lakeview in hopes to buy a hot chocolate or something along those lines, but no, nothing like that was sold. They did have coffee, and even though I know that purchasing a decaf from pretty much anyone always ends in disappointment, I did it anyway, (it was freaking coooold out). Well, ya blech... it was terrible. Ok, #2 - I grabbed a peanut butter cookie with chocolate in the middle to take home (or eat on the way home). Decadently delicious. Tasted homemade. Lastly, #3 - lunch. I've had their chili (albeit, years ago... it was very good, also tasted homemade). I've purchased their lunch in a box, and was happy. Its a pretty good deal, sandwich was great, it was satisfying and it's not 'fast food'. Most recently, I bought 1/2 a turkey, avocado, bacon melt sandwich, and sat down in the restaurant to eat. Wonderful sandwich!! Delicious sourdough bread, (I believe) was tender and crunchy in all the right places, the melted cheese blanked the turkey and crispy bacon. With each bite i enjoyed the taste of lovely grilled red bell pepper, tender spinach leaves and creamy avocado slice. Yum, yum, yum. Half a sandwich was plenty enough. I'd be afraid to see what a whole size would look like. Interesting decor. Old wooden tables and booths. Old fashioned decorations and trinkets are found as you look around, as well as German collectible beer glasses, steins, etc., which I guess fit in well with the very old hotel building as it is. The guy who works the counter every time I go in is great. Super friendly, funny, helpful and accommodating. Oh, sodas are available, they even sell cans of Izze  plenty of bakery, premade salads to go in your lunch box as a side. I saw vanilla ice cream cups in the upright freezer too. Give them a try!"}
