{"text":"I never knew this place existed until my sister wanted to have dinner here.  It's tucked in the back of the old sawmill with a pretty large patio.  Since the weather was nice, the patio was full while inside was probably just a quarter full. 
Decor is nice and bright.  The wait staff is nice and are knowledgeable of the menu items. 
We had a table of 7 (4 of them were kids) so we ordered pretty quickly before the kids get too rowdy.  There's a kids menu that doubles as a colouring/activity sheet to keep them busy. Nice. 
Though we ordered pretty quickly, it took a very long time for the food to come out even though we specified that  the kids meals could come out with the fried calamari app.  It took over half and hour for the app to come out and then another 10 minutes for the kids' meals.  It was a long meal.
I had the West Coastwich that I paired with a side salad that comes with a raspberry vinaigrette.  It's a vegetarian sandwich with a fried eggplant, portobello mushroom and shredded provolone cheese.  It was okay, but I wished the cheese was at least a bit melted.
My sister had the pulled pork sandwich which I wished I ordered. The pork was tender and smothered in a spicy bbq sauce.  If you're not into spicy food, I would skip this as half way through the meal the spiciness builds quite a bit.
They have a large selection of wings with some interesting flavours - I'd probably come back if I'm in the area to check it out."}
{"text":"No doubt the best \"casual\" food on Main Street. If you compare it to the other joints that serve late night food on Unionville Main it stands head and shoulders above the rest. Wings are meaty and served with a wide variety of sauces, but each one is distinct unlike some other wing places. Have had a wide selection of appetizers, they are all tasty and show more creativity than your average value eatery. I would definitely  recommend the wings and onion rings.  Nothing will blow your mind but it is certainly above average (especially the dishes I pointed out earlier). My major qualm is that it feels more like a high end bar then a bistro."}
{"text":"Great wings and rings, a great atmosphere and reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"excellent location in beautiful Unionville. Tried the half price chicken wings on a sunday and they were absolutely fantastic, price-wise and in quality. They were big, much bigger than any other set of wings i've tried anywhere. Totally worth the trip, the burger sliders looked tempting too which I will definitely try during my next visit.

Patio sits beside a pond which I think is a nice bonus in terms of ambiance."}
{"text":"Delicious wings, meaty and flavorful and attentive staff. Their desserts however leave much to be desired. They are obviously not made in house but even buying a Presidents Choice frozen dessert would be much, much better so skip dessert and fill up on wings."}
{"text":"Nice looking patio perfect for the sunny days.  But they need some more large umbrellas. Service is extremely slow here - serve team takes forever and kitchen is super slow even when it wasn't busy.  Wings are not bad as well.  Size of the wings are on the bigger side so you get 7 pieces if you order 1lb.  Dragon Bistro offers around 20 flavors to pick from.  Good thing about Dragon Bistro is they have their own parking lot so you don't have to walk all the way down."}
{"text":"This is the best wing spot in Markham. For years I've loved the Crown and Dragon on Yonge north of Bloor, and I was super excited when I learned that the same wings would be available in Unionville! There are so many choices, and most deliver the goods. It's miles ahead of places like Wild Wing that have more flavours but are wildly inconsistent.

The wings here are just as good as those in the downtown location, and there's a decent selection of beers on tap. I've only ever been on weeknights when it hasn't been busy, so there isn't much in the way of atmosphere, but everything is well kept and clean, even if there is nothing terribly fancy about the decor."}
{"text":"Get the: coconut flavored wings!

Price: $11 per lb of wings (7-8 wings), half price on Wed and Sunday.

Overall: The wings were OK, large and juicy, but most of the flavors didn't come through.

I never would have found this place had a friend not recommended it to me on a Sunday for half price wings. While on Unionville Main Street, it's a bit hidden as it's away from the busy sections of the street and there isn't much visible signage from the street. 

Anyway, walking in I was pleasantly surprised. Like the rest of Main Street, it has the old wooden decor and has a comfortable atmosphere for a resto-bar establishment. They have several TVs which were playing the football games but it was more of a restaurant atmosphere than a sports bar.

The wings menu was pretty interesting. It was different than the rest of those 1,000,000 flavors places. With approx 30 different flavors, it was still an extensive menu but the some flavors seemed pretty unique. They had tandoori flavored wings, a sweet coconut flavor, molasses with horseradish, peri-peri, and even apple cinnamon!

While the menu caught my eye, the wings themselves were just ok. I had a bunch of guys with me so we tried about 12 of the flavors they had to offer.  None of them were very spicy, so if you like spicy wings don't expect to be wowed by the heat meter here.  The flavor on some of the wings was also too subtle. I was really excited for the apples and cinnamon flavor, which smelled a heck of a lot like apple pie when it arrived but failed to connect with my taste buds. Another one which was advertised as molasses with horseradish also didn't have much horseradish, so it was pretty much just a sweet wing (like a honey garlic flavor). The wings themselves were large and juicy though, so thumbs up there.

The coconut flavored wings were by far my favorite, it was definitely unique and I'd go back for those. My runner up would be one from the Baked Wings list, I forgot the name but it was smokey and packed good flavor. 

All in all, it's a nice atmosphere, big and juicy wings (though I wish the flavors would come out more), and average prices. I'd go back to try other things if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Good place to get your wing on.

Disclaimer: I've only been here for half-price wings (Wednesday & Sunday with the purchase of a beverage).  Booths are kinda tight, especially after a few pounds of wings.  Note that a pitcher of beer counts towards 3 people maximum for the wing deal.  We wanted a pitcher of Fruli Strawberry, but they don't offer it anymore, despite being on the drinks menu.  Disappointed, we opted for a more masculine draught instead.

The wings are pretty big and moist.  They have a good variety of flavours, often more adventurous than the usual places.  Holy Habanero isn't as scary as advertised, but is tasty.  Yam fries are nice and fluffy, regular fries are good too.

You'll leave full, lightly buzzed and smelling wing sauce under your fingernails for days; all for $20/person."}
{"text":"We visited The Dragon Bistro a couple times this summer and enjoyed ourselves.  They have a million flavours for wings.  Nice patio in the summer too.  I must note their \"Dragon's Breath\" wings are milder than their sister restaurant at Yonge & Bloor  (crown and dragon) in Toronto.  Must be the \"905\" version of the Dragon's Breath, LOL!"}
{"text":"Dragon bistro is GONE... They changed name, owner and kitchen staff even though the menu remains the same.  Me and 3 friends went there for Monday wings special.  We ordered 4 lbs of wings and they were all absolutely TERRIBLE!!  Even my homemade salt/pepper BBQ wings taste better."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday afternoon for wings. 10.95 for 1lb less three dollars promo for Sunday.   No fruilli beer.  If you're around to take it easy. This is the place as service is uber slow.  Chicken wings are massive but nothing extraordinary and probably less than average. Got 1lb honeycomb which basically was honey garlic and 1lb smoking gun (BBQ sauce with a small kick). both were meh. not much interest in ordering them again. loved the patio. parking also exclusively for bistro on site."}
{"text":"My review might be totally different if I am here for their wings?? 

Happy Hour 4 pm to 6 pm with Buy one get one free app does sounded good?!

But sadly the food here is not good... I don't have high expectation with pub food... but what we ordered were beyond bad!

Scallop wrapped in Bacon ($10.95) is not bad... I washed them down with my half pint of Stellar ($3.60)... 

The Dragon Sliders ($9.95) has the driest patties I ever have... even when my Yelp friend ordered another pint of beer and tried washing that down.. he just could not do it!! The bun looks as sad... only the fried onion used as garnishes tasted decent

Don't even bother to use the drink menu to find out what they have on drafts... as they don't really have some of them anymore.... 

I don't know if I will be back to a pub that lack beer selections and has mediocre food?! 

FYI, chicken wings no longer 1/2 price on Wednesdays and Sundays... only $3 off instead....

Stick with Wings... Stick with Wings... Stick with Wings..."}
