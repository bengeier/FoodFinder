{"text":"Nothing like a nail biter..what a great finish to the dbacks opener.  That being said the concession experience at doubleheaders was less than memorable.  Gotta love a lukewarm hot dog on a stale bun.  They had run out and guess they were in too much of a hurry.  Total bill was $18.25.  Gave them a $20...was given $1 back and told they had no quarters!  After waiting in line for over 20 minutes I just shrugged my shoulders and went back to my seat.  Levy, it was a sellout did you forget to go to the bank and not realize most fans will want a hot dog."}

{"text":"***Chase Field's main concession stand Double Headers features a value menu that includes hot dogs, corn dogs and popcorn for $1.50 each; the concessions here are similar to what you will find at any other stadium, but the lower prices are refreshing***

Double Headers is the main concession stand at Chase Field.  They have multiple locations all throughout the stadium, which make them very easy to find.  They serve the traditional baseball stadium food like hot dogs, french fries and popcorn.  There are some items that are only available at some of the Double Headers stands though (like the nachos).  I am not sure, but I think some of the Double Headers also sell a foot-long corn dog.

Double Headers does provide one big advantage over many arena/stadium concessions stands.  They have a value menu that features items like hot dogs, corn dogs and popcorn for $1.50 each.  We went with the popcorn and it was okay.  It was not super light or super fresh, but it was perfectly serviceable.  It was a decent size too.  That size of popcorn would probably run about $4 at a movie theater concessions stand.

We also went with the nachos, which were corn tortilla chips topped with jalapenos and a side of melted nacho cheese.  The chips were the kind of hearty gold tortilla chips that you would get from a grocery store.  They were crunchy, but they were not the freshest chips.

The jalapenos were good and the nacho cheese here was better than what you would find at most arenas/stadiums.  The nacho cheese had a little bit of spice and heat to it.  That is rare for stadium cheese dips.  Usually, stadium cheese dips are very bland.

Service was fine.

I like trying more city/team-specific concessions when visiting a new stadium and there is a good number of them at Chase Field (local chains like Macayo's and Streets of New York pizza).  Double Headers, on the other hand, is very run-of-the-mill concessions.  Still, the value menu here makes Double Headers a good option if you are a stadium regular or are looking to get some food without having to spend too much money."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC value menu! 1.50 regular hot dogs, cot dogs, pop, and tiny bag of popcorn! I love this place. It makes coming to a game affordable. So affordable I can see 15+ games a year:) thank you double headers & diamondback organization"}
{"text":"Father's Day 2018 served up the lousiest service on all floors.  It took 35 minutes in line and the cashiers told folk right after they were out of items just to get rid of people.  Kitchens were poorly organized and it took one cashier ten minutes to get a customer 4 beers from the tap.  The franchise is looking disheveled and can wreck a nice experience at a ball game."}
{"text":"What can I say...sometimes you just have to have something to et at the ball game."}
{"text":"Gotta love a place at any stadium across the country that charges only $1.50 for hotdogs, corn dogs, soda, and more.  The Value Menu is where it's at! Sure they are smaller, but get 2 hotdogs for $3.  Shit, get 3 hotdogs for $4.50! Still an amazing deal for a baseball game."}
{"text":"Near section 130 Worst service ever. Ran out of hotdogs by the third inning. People serving were literally asleep at the register.....yawning and moving like sloths on pain meds."}
