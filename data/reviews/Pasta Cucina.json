{"text":"Came here last week with a friend before we went to a movie. I am always reluctant to try italian because more times than not, it's a dissapointment. The bread was soft and hot. My wine was cold, and the Ravioli with Tomatoe cream sauce was pretty damn good. I try not to eat till i'm stuffed, but I had a hard time pushing my plate away!   This place may not be a mom and pop authentic Italian restaurant but for the price which BTW was very reasonable it was very good. I will gladly return again and agian. I believe our waiters name was Zach and he also was very good and very attentive! Makes an evening out much more enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Spent friday evening at Capri in Sunset Station. We were seated almost immediately by a very pleasant and welcoming hostess. Russell was our server and he was outstanding. He explained the specials to us and showed us the prix fixe menu they are now offering for $25.  This includes a choice of appetizer, a main course, and desert, plus a glass of their excellent house wine. Station was offering a coupon for $50 worth of food for $30 so this made for quite a value. My wife had the grilled chicken fettucini alfredo and I settled on the chicken parmesan. Both were delicious and the portions were huge. We will definitely return to Capri."}
{"text":"The restaurant has great ambiance and great service, and the food is serviceable. My rating is more along the lines of 3.5 stars. I appreciate that they offer free breadsticks with two dipping sauces, and with your entree you get the choice of minestrone soup, house salad, or Caesar salad.   The breadsticks were okay, they would be bland without the dipping sauces (marinara and alfredo). The soup came with lots of ingredients but lacked depth of flavor. I had the Fruitti de Mar pasta which came with 3 shrimp, 3 calamari, 5 mussels and about 7-8 clams. The seafood was delicious but the pasta was bleh. I wish the pasta sauce was thicker and clung better to the pasta.   It's not a bad place, there's just nothing to make it stand out amongst the hundreds of Italian restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Terrible food! I ordered the fettuccine with artichoke and I felt like I was eating noodles in boiled water. Beautiful restaurant, but terrible tasting food. The waitress was really inattentive. Better off going to Olive Garden."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, enough to order a few different things off the menu. Service is always quick and the host and waiters, especially the bartender are all very friendly!  Three things I've tried : the cheese raviolis, the pizza ( which I didn't care for) and the best item \"the seafood pasta\" Frutti Di Mar is to die for!  Give it a chance! I enjoyed it very much. The place is great for family dinners!"}
{"text":"We ate here tonight and I think this is the first time we've done so since they switched over and became Pasta Cucina and redid the menu. That being said, it was a bit of a mixed bag. Our server was very good - personable without being intrusive. The cheesecake was fantastic - one of the better ones we've had. My entree was a little more of a mixed bag. My husband and I both had the eggplant parmigiana, but I swapped the normal spaghetti for fettuccine alfredo. The eggplant was cut a bit too thickly to get it super tender and one of my pieces was a bit bitter. Nothing horrible or inedible, but not great. The alfredo sauce wasn't memorable either - not a strong, rich flavor. We'll go back, but I'll try a different menu item."}
{"text":"The food was very good (we had chicken picatta, penne and sausage, and shrimp scampi).  The service was also very good.  And the best part was the price!  We had a top shelf martini (with Belvedere vodka), a big bottle of Pelligrino, and the three entrees mentioned above (which came with soup or salad), and the total bill was only  $41!"}
{"text":"My brother wanted to come here for Christmas... and I must admit, I had my doubts.  I had already been to the Pasta Cucina at Aliante a while ago and remember it not being so hot.  How could the one at Texas Station be any better?  Well I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised when we walked into the restaurant.  It was very beautiful inside and had an old school feel- it was full of booths that were a mod green and the half-moon shape that I imagine the Rat Pack to be kicking it in.  There was also plenty of interesting art on the walls.  It definitely got me started on the right foot.  They start everyone off with breadsticks and that makes me very happy.  My belly + carbs = smiles.  Are they the greatest breadsticks I've ever had?  No.  But they must have been pretty good considering I had a couple of them.  They keep olive oil and balsamic vinegar on the table if you feel the need to dunk your sticks.  We ordered the Antipasti appetizer which included 3 fried zucchini, 3 fried mozzarella, and 2 tomato bruschetta.  Everything was very well executed and flavorful, and not only came with the typical marinara but also some yummy alfredo for your fried foods.  Bonus points!  Next up, I had the house salad with the house dressing.  The salad was large and the vegetables were fresh.  The creamy tomato dressing had a lot of flavor without feeling too heavy like some creamy dressings tend to do.  I really enjoyed it (I know, it's a salad but I like my veggies) and recommend it.  So everything up until this point had been really great and that left me feeling good about the main course.  But then we waited.  And waited.  ...and waited.  Were they picking my husband's eggplant from the garden?  Were they still flying in my brother's shrimp?  I'm not quite sure what the deal was, but I'm guessing our food was just sitting in the back waiting to be brought to our table.  I had the manicotti which was filled with cheese and spinach.  It would have been pretty good, but I think it had been sitting in its little serving dish too long- the pasta was pretty chewy... almost crunchy.  My husband had the eggplant parm.  I do not recommend this at all.  The eggplant was swallowed up in the thickest layer of breading known to man.  You could hardly even see the eggplant hiding inside, let alone taste it.  To top it off, his pasta had dried out (sitting around in the back?) and didn't look very good.  My brother had the seafood linguini and said he liked it.  We finished the meal with the chocolate decadence cake and a slice of cheesecake.  While the chocolate cake was really good, the star of the desserts was by far the cheesecake.  It had the perfect creamy texture and it tasted great.  I just wish it had a tiny bit more strawberry sauce and whipped cream.  I'm pretty torn on this place.  It is a really nice looking restaurant and would make a great date spot, but the consistency of the food was off.  Almost everything we had to eat was great, but the most important thing (the main course) was not so good.  If you're going to cook something right at your restaurant, shouldn't it be the main course?  The price is pretty right here, the service was really good, and the restaurant itself is beautiful.  If you are in the area, I would say give it a shot."}
{"text":"I did not expect what we got from this place! Having lived in Reno and Vegas for almost 13 years, I know that locals casinos can have good places, but it's best to keep expectations low and be pleasantly surprised by the great ones. This is a GREAT ONE!  We stopped in for dinner after a movie. We were the last ones in before they closed the kitchen, and for that we were thankful. We were all out grateful that they never once made us feel rushed.  We skipped appetizers, as we had had popcorn at the movie. My hubby ordered the fettuccine alfredo, and I had the veal francese. The alfredo sauce was fantastic. There's not much in it but cream and cheese and it's done well. Extremely rich. The lemon sauce on the veal was out of this world. Perfectly balanced lemony but not sour and buttery and herby. The kitchen was out of mashed potatoes, which is the typical side for te dish. The waitress and I discussed it and I got angel hair with more of the lemon sauce. It was just the right substitution, and I will order it that way on purpose in the future!  The big winner of the night was the tiramisu. Chef Dianna has something REALLY special there. It was heavenly perfection with just all the right stuff. We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant for years as the San Lorenzo. It has had its ups and downs, the new menu is good - but most important, the service and the food are very good. Our waiter was Algis, probably the best waiter that we have ever met - anywhere, very professional, very cool! The food was good, right temperature, good taste. Dixie and I each had a chicken and pasta dish, the pasta was done right, flavorfull sauce. We had the salad, the new soups are not as good as they used to be. The bread sticks are warm and soft - but not like the breads that San Lorenzo had... they should bring back the old bread offerings.  Overall - nice! Thank You!"}
{"text":"I used to absolutely love the Pasta Palace because of the endless pasta meal for $9.99. Back in the day, I could put down 2 whole plates of pasta... Unlike most places that do the endless thing, Pasta Palace does it right - the pasta was high quality and extremely tasty... Besides that they also gave you endless salad and my personal favorite - roasted garlic!  I've heard that they've stopped doing the endless pasta meal, which saddens me :( Hopefully they bring it back!  They have plenty of other options that I've tried that are also very good and reasonable... I would definitely recommend this place... Its off the strip, which is part of the reason why the prices are more reasonable... And I understand that lots of locals eat here. If you have a way to get there, do it!"}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better.  Okay, I have huge issues with what most Italian cuisine out there poses to be.  Don't give me a meal that anyone can make with a decent understanding of how their kitchen and a grocery store work... and then do like a 400% mark-up on the price.  Worse still, it's becoming increasingly difficult to find a place that use fresh ingredients and makes things from scratch.  Otherwise, last I checked, a box of pasta and a can of tomatoes were pretty darn cheap.  In another words, I crave authenticity and value (I know: those two don't always play well with each other), and as usual, this Italian left me disappointed.  This place came highly recommended to me as good, fairly priced Italian food.  The chicken cannelloni were talked up so much, that three, out of the five of us, ordered it.  For $12 a plate, I expect more than just two standard cannelloni (even if just a side salad or something), especially if the chicken was pretty dry -- if I were to guess, a consequence of prefabrication.  Yet to its credit, the bechamel sauce had perfect consistency and wasn't too rich.  Luckily the bread, oil, and balsamic were gratis so I could at least get my fill.  Looking at the menu, I will say the prices aren't as bad as most culprits, yet the quality could be taken up a notch to meet them.  Also, the ambiance deserves a note.  Italian places usually goes in one of two directions: a Tuscan kitchen motif or a Sicilian mafia motif.  While the former tends to be more intimate, the latter, like this establishment, tends to be classier.  The booths have ample leg as well as elbow room.  I would call the lighting romantic without being too dim.  The hostess was delightfully bubbly.  Service by the waitress was spot on without any deficiencies or commendations of note.  Despite my trepidations, I might find myself here again."}
{"text":"I have to admit I liked it better as Pips... :/ The wine bar is one of my favorite things at this place and even the other night just was not hitting the right spot.  I know we had a few appetizers and they were delicious! the sliders were my fave!"}
{"text":"First off I have to give this place 1 star but if I could give it NO stars I would!   A group of us are in town for a bowling tournament at Sunset Station and decided to have dinner at this place because its inside the casino and convenient, and the decor looked like it would be a nice place for a nice dinner with friends. About the only this this restaurant has going for itself is the appearance. The furniture is nice and modern and the restaurant itself looks remodeled. But don't let that fool you, what comes out of the kitchen is terrible, but more about what they call \"food\" later...  We had a reservation for 12 people at 8pm. We arrived early and requested to be seated, it was about 10 mins before 8pm. It wasn't like they didn't have the tables ready because we did make a reservation and no one was sitting at the tables we were going to, but nonetheless we sat down about 10 after 8pm. Because of the size of our group we had to split into 2 tables. We sat for about 10 mins before anyone even came by to greet us or offer any drinks.  The water boy finally came, then the waitress about 10 mins after him. We were starving so we ordered our drinks, appetizers/salads, and entrees at the same time. I wish someone would have told us that it would take over 30 mins to get our salads and another 45 mins to get our food. In fact people who came in after us, ordered their food, got their food, ate their food, and left before we even for our entrees. Bad, bad, bad service only gets worse.  The food was terrible! Overall it was just bad. Only 1 person out of our entire group was satisfied with the quality of his food, he got the steak. I ordered the veal scaloppini, and when it came it was a disaster! I asked what was in the sauce because it looked creamy and I'm lactose intolerant, the waitress said it was lemon butter. I made my bf taste it, he said it wasn't good and had cream in the sauce, so I sent it back and asked for just some plain pasta with marinara sauce. The veal was pounded super thin, and it was hard to cut through and tasted really bland according to my bf. The waitress didn't even know what was in the food she served, SMH. After waiting for another 20 mins without the food coming I decided to cancel my order all together because everyone else was done with their meals. My bf ordered the chicken marsala, which was so gross that when I took a bite I chewed on it for about 30 seconds before I had to spit it out! It was BAD!!!  We had to call a manager come over because everything was so bad. But he must know how bad the food and service was because it seemed like he heard it all before. He wasn't apologetic or seemed to care at all. He did say, however that our waitress Jessica is one of the best they have, which didn't mean much because she wasn't great and our service sucked! I asked for a split check, she acknowledged it, then brought one check with everyone's meal on it. Ummmmm... Hello?????  Food service was terrible, food quality was worse. Oh BTW, I should mention that the same jerk manager who did nothing for us ordered his food after us, sat down and ate it at the bar in front of us, and finished before we even for our salads. You would think that at some point he would've looked up and said, \"hey they've been sitting there for a while without any food, I should go see whats going on...\" but no, he sat there watching tv, eating his food.  I should mention that the restaurant was a little busy when we first sat down, but after an hour of us being there, only 4 tables were seated in addition to ours. So it wasn't like they were busy and that's why the food and service were Bad...  I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy!!! DO NOT EAT AT PASTA CUCINA UNLESS YOU WANT TERRIBLE FOOD AND EVEN WORSE SERVICE!!!"}
{"text":"Bar staff was rude, the wait staff was great. Well priced and good. .. definitely not great. However, the value puts it in my top 10 for a quick eat."}
{"text":"If you can make good Pasta at Home, save your cash. If not this place is OK."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and fairly priced. Everyone I was with really enjoyed their food and said they would go back again. We were unsure about the wine our waiter recommended so he let us taste it first. After the taste we knew he was knowledgeable about the wine list and what wine paired with what food."}
{"text":"Wow...what a pleasant surprise...i tried the Alfredo w/chicken and my better half had the chicken parmesan...both dishes were good but we really enjoyed the warm bread sticks with alfredo dipping sauce. The service was good and the cost was less than what we would have paid if we had ordered the same meal at the Olive Garden or the Claim Jumper. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Il Vino is a great Italian restaurant located up in Aliante and I must say, it is definitely a steal!  My family and I decided to try something new for Italian food that was not Olive Garden.  There were 10 of us who went in to have dinner and we were just thrilled with the entire experience! The staff was very accommodating of our large group (we failed to make reservations), the food was great and the prices were just right!  Everyone in our party was thrilled with their food and the portions were very large.  I myself had the chicken parm and it was delicious!  Since dining there, my husband and I have already returned to have drinks and to enjoy their great $3 small bites menu.  If you live in the northwest, I definitely suggest trying out this place!  Enjoy"}
{"text":"*Local's perspective*  This little gem in the back of the Sunset Station Hotel and Casino is a must try!  My girlfriend and I were hungry after not eating all day due to running errands and were in the area.  We'd never been into this casino so we wandered in and it's a good thing we did!  First, the place is very well decorated!  The \"patio\" area has faux lemon trees with string lighting over head making you feel as though you are truly dining under an open sunset.  The furniture and decor only add to the feel of being in a \"upscale\" Italian restaurant.   Second, the service... PHENOMENAL! The hostess was very sweet and courteous and sat us immediately.  Our server, Russel, was AWESOME!  He was on top of everything. He knew the menu and gave us great recommendations to try (which were all great). We needed new silverware, boom he was there with it, new plates, boom he was there with it, more water, boom ice water in my cup.  Couldn't have asked for better service.  The food runner and busser were both great as well.  Didn't get names but were great!  Third, the food.  Now, I know this isn't an upscale Italian restaurant or a mom and pop one, but man the food at this price point was good.  Nothing over the top and nothing \"decent\", just good quality apps, food, and wine that hit the spot.  Overall very satisfied and would not hesitate to go back!"}
{"text":"Go to anywhere else! We never got to actually eat there because the service was so bad!   As we are walking in my sister steps on a huge shard of glass in front of the hostess podium. It went through her shoe and ur her foot. The securit guard was standing there and said nothing. My mother had to point out the other huge chunks of glass that were on the floor. when the hostess finally walked up all she could say was \"oh sorry\". We say party of 5, she tells us 5-10 minutes and to please I wait in the bar.  We sit in the bar where I provide my sister with an alchohal swab for her bleeding foot.   Fast forward about 20min..... We are still siting there, my mom goes over and asks how much longer (keep in mind this is a Thursday at 7pm) the hostess says she isn't sure and scurries off. ...  Fast forward about 10minutes.... (total wait time is now 30min) the manager comes up and says the hostess was wrong it will be another 30-40min wait. That their kitchen is backed up. Did not say sorry about my sisters foot, just made an excuse that their kitchen is busy.   We leave..... As we were walking by there were only about 7 tables seated. This is a larger resteraunt. Not sure why the kitchen was so behind. Needless to say, we won't be attempting to go there again."}
{"text":"We have tried to enjoy a meal here on two occasions.  Disappointed is a kind comment.  How can you call yourself an italian restaurant and not be able to make sauce.  Its as if there are no spice in the kitchen at all when they cook.   When we mentioned it to the server, he acted as though the sauce is always bland.  No one cared.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Boy do I love me a good wine lounge. Yes, II Vino is more than just a lounge. It's a restaurant as well, but I only partook in the lounge aspect of this establishment...and it was a little slice of wonderful.   Yesterday, a couple of friends and myself went here to kill some time before our movie. My inner-wino eagerly adds that entering this place was like stepping into Narnia. We were instantly engulfed by the demure ambiance. Personally, I forgot for a few moments that we just exited a noisy casino. After picking out an area in the lounge, we went up to the bar and ordered our wine. I can't remember the wine I ordered which is a little embarrassing. I was so excited, I literally picked the first one at the top of the red wine list. What I do remember about the flavor was that it had some hints of orange in it. Take my word for it, it was good.   We proceeded to sip our wines and have a nice chat in our cozy little corner. The one thing that I found slightly unimpressive was that after we did order our wine and sat, the servers seemed to forget about us. Granted we were only there for 25 minutes, but no one came around once to ask how we were. They were very kind when we interacted with them upon our arrival, but there was no contact after that. A small bummer, but not something that would deter me from returning at a later date."}
{"text":"We found Pasta Palace by running into it while getting a Starbucks at The Palace Station, which is a very budget oriented hotel.  Surprisingly Pasta Palace turned into a gem; the food was quite good, the prices were downright cheap and the service was good given that the hotel Palace Station is an absolute dump.  But alas, it didn't last...while in bankrupcy, the hotel is cutting costs everywhere and on our last trip to Pasta Palace, the food quality went down in a big way; the portions cut considerably and the prices went up.  It now looks and feels like fast food Italian, which is  too bad.  But if you want really inexpensive Italian and food quality isn't a consideration, it could be a decent choice but it's not the gem it once was."}
{"text":"I went to s special event here where they reserved the whole restaurant and catered it.   We had salad, a cheese and berry tray,  crackers,  dinner roles,  mashed potatoes,  lasagna,  steak,  a creamy chicken and rice, carrots and asparagus. All amazing   They also provided a stocked dessert table and open bar! !      I was  extremely Impressed with this place. First time but will definitely be back to try regular menu! !"}
{"text":"Service and food was very slow. Messed up my order twice. My sons birthday and they forgot the cake. Nobody enjoyed... Overall...sucks!"}
{"text":"This was our first time to go to this restaurant (located inside Sunset Station Casino in Henderson, NV) and would most likely be the last! The service is ridiculously slow!  Or we were victims of DISCRIMINATION!   We ordered our food \"to go\" thinking that we could get the food sooner!  But guess what?  We had to wait 55 MINUTES!!  And probably ONLY 55 minutes because I started getting upset about the whole thing and started asking questions. The \"manager\" Doug) could only come up with an excuse that it was a busy night.  Busy?  There were a lot of vacant tables.  I told him that I decided to order the food \"to go\" in order to get the food sooner.  I asked him if he would make his sit-down customers wait 1 hour to get their food. He explained that this didn't usually happen and then argues that sit-down customers would be having their soup and appetizers while their entrees were being prepared.  I replied that not all customers order soup and appetizers.  So, did that mean that he would make the customers wait 1 hour? He could only come up with the same excuse that this usually does not happen but they were \"busy\" tonight. So then I asked why was it that the guy who came in and placed his \"to go\" order 15 minutes LATER than I did got his order 25 minutes BEFORE I got mine?  The manager \"explained\" that it was the pizza.  When I told him that the other guy also ordered pizza, Doug then added that my order of linguine with clams also caused the delay. What? Did they have to make the pasta dough for the linguine from scratch right that moment then cook the pasta and the white clam sauce also made from scratch right that minute? They didn't have any of the ingredients prepared beforehand?  Come on, that's a lame excuse. The manager was either a liar or had no clue of what was going on because when I got to the room (we're actually staying at the hotel at Sunset Station Casino), the linguine was warm but the pizza was already cold. So, blaming the delay on the pizza was just another lame excuse. The pizza must have been ready for a long time that's why it was already cold.  Oh, here's the kicker: after all this, to add insult to injury, Doug, the \"manager\", offered me A WHOPPING (now get this) 20% OFF MY BILL !!!  A lousy stinking 20% discount for all the aggravation I had to endure. What an INSULT!! I told him that I didn't need his 20% discount. I told him he could keep it and I'll just write my review on YELP.  I added that the casino would probably not be happy that he kept us for 1 hour waiting for a \"to go\" order instead of us gambling at the casino.  I don't know what hospitality school he attended but that school should be closed down and Doug fired!  I placed the word manager in quotes because I'm not really sure if he really was the manager. If he was really the manager, then, like I said earlier, he's a very lousy one and should be replaced by a more competent person."}
{"text":"While this is truly not a 5-star restaurant, I give it 4 stars for a variety of factors: Cost, Quality and their Dessert.  Overall the menu is quite un-exciting: pasta, chicken, salads; your typical Italian faire.  The cost, however, for many of the dishes is half of what you might pay at a similar restaurant on the strip.  All-you-can-eat pasta in many different styles is $7.99.  While it doesn't show this on the menu, it is advertised throughout the casino.  Add to this the dark, romantic atmosphere and the appropriate music and you may have a nice date here (except for when someone like me brings his little kid who makes a lot of noise).  The quality of the food is quite good though it is just common Italian restaurant faire.  I always enjoy my meal and it's accessories (soup, salad, bread).  Do not fill up on the bread, of course, as all-you-can-eat ends up being one plate (the portions are quite large for one plate).  Lastly, the dessert was a surprise (though again, for an Italian restaurant, not so surprising).  Usually I will take my son to the bakery in Palace Station and let him pick something out.  However this time the waitress asked if we would like dessert and I asked what they had.  She mentioned Gelato (an Italian ice-cream type dessert).  When I asked her how much, she stated it was $1.99 for each (flavors like Cappucino, Pistachio and Vanilla Bean to name a few).  I expected a small, small portion but again the portion was large and we were thoroughly satisified with what we had ordered.  In summary, Pasta Palace at Palace Station is an excellent choice for an Italian dinner (hours are from 5pm to around Midnight).  On Mondays the dinner is $19.99 per person as local crooner Wes Winters performs a classic Vegas-style dinner and a show (I have not been to this but it sounds like a nice time).  Since I am the first to review this, I hope others check it out and add their input."}
{"text":"Fried calamari the best in the menu!! Luv it, thanks God I found a replacement for Brio."}
{"text":"Dinner started badly with Minestrone soup that tasted tinny for lack of a better description. It consisted of canned veggies!   The bread sticks with dipping sauce were very good. The shrimp scampi tasted very bright , shrimp was over cooked but the sauce saved it all. And the plate with mussels, shrimp calamari etc was excellent. Boulder station location."}
{"text":"$5 pizzas at the bar are ok along with the cool wine serving machine but entrees are plain, unimaginative, and dry. Don't order them!"}
{"text":"We are locals and went to Pasta Cucina Saturday night .what a big disappointment,no more bread sticks with 2 dipping sauces,no soup or salad with entree.the pasta leaves a lot to be desired.(worse sauce that I every had in my life)i think the chef should find a new line of work.I would never pay $9.00 for a salad with a few croutons.(a whole head of lettuce is 98 cents ) I bet they close this restaurant just like they did their  Mexican one."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I was a bit skeptical to take my 9-month pregnant wife here, especially since we are self proclaimed foodies and have eaten at most of the top rated Italian locales. We were super happy with the restaurant and we were both very pleasantly surprised. The ambiance, food, service, price, everything was great. We'd highly recommend it. Our waiter was Guillermo......he was awesome.  We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My mom and I have a day where we hang out eat, gamble and hang out. We got a boarding pass $10 off. Now I am a huge fan of Olive Garden, but Pasta Cucina is almost as good. You get bread sticks with marinara & alfredo sauce. The alfredo is beyond good! Marinara iso bland, very . I got Alfredo with shrimp & oh my deliciousness the shrimp is amazing!!!! Get it you won't be sorry. The service is really slow, actually I am going back today and I want another server. Asking for a refill of water takes forever, but the food is good so let's hope service is better today. Overall it is worth a shot to try it out."}
{"text":"Their boring pepperoni pizza tasted as if it came out of a box. I especially didn't like the type of pepperoni they used. I prefer the bigger, flat ones. The cheese bread sticks were OK but could've used more flavor, such as garlic or something. The service was good, but the food isn't good enough for me to return."}
{"text":"I went to Pasta Cucina on Friday 3/29/13 with 4 other women.  One of the women had chosen this place for dinner to celebrate the birthday of one of the women in our group.   The decor at the restaurant is very nice.  It's very open and comfortable.  There are \"lemon trees\" throughout the restaurant.  The ceiling is pained to look like blue skies with puffy white clouds, and the kitchen open so you can see what the cooks are doing.   Our reservation was for 7pm.  We had planned to be done around 8:45pm, we could go to the 9pm bingo session, then around 10pm go to the Spazmatics show.  So much for plans.  The hostess was very friendly and seated us immediately.  There was supposed to be 6 of us for dinner, so the hostess sat us a big round table with a huge \"lazy Susan\" in the center.    Once we sat down that's all we did.  We sat and sat and sat some more.  A female server walked by after about 10 minutes and said \"I'll be back\" ( in her case was that a promise or threat)?  After another 10 minutes the same server comes back and takes our drink order...We still had NOTHING...no water, no bread, just our menus.    Okay, so we place our drink order.  About 10 minutes later someone comes by to pour us water.  Then a few minutes later the server delivers two baskets of bread.  The bread was bread sticks, similar to what's served at Olive Garden.  Not very impressing.  What was nice was the bread is served with bowls of marinara sauce and fettuccine sauce (at no extra charge), and there's olive oil and balsamic vinegar at the table.  Well, at least now we have bread to distract us, though we still don't have our beverages.   About 10 minutes later our beverages and salads are delivered.  The salads were nothing to write home about.  Iceberg lettuce that in some instances was wilted and some shredded red cabbage.  No tomatoes or peperoncini (this is an Italian restaurant, right)?   There we are with our less than stellar salads.  We ate slowly...maybe about 20 minutes and still ended up turning to the bread again (and it really was nothing to brag about, but I hadn't eaten all day).   FINALLY the entrees get delivered.  2 of us ordered the Frutti di Mar, the birthday girl ordered the Parmesan Shrimp, another person ordered the ravioli, and I ordered the Chicken with Artichoke.   The Frutti di Mar had mussels that were basically room temperature and the pasta was lukewarm.   The Shrimp Parmesan was a big plate of pasta with shrimp. It looked okay, but I didn't try it.  The ravioli looked good.  I'm not a fan of ravioli, but the dish looked good. Each ravioli was round in shape, probably about 2 inches around and there were at least 8 on the plate with a good amount of sauce.  My Chicken with Artichoke was good.  Not the best in the world, but okay (it was only $9.99).  Quality-wise it was better than Olive Garden, but honestly I think Romano's Macaroni grill has better food.  It was a light oil sauce, a bit heavy on the lemon juice, a fair amount of artichoke and chicken with a sprinkling of capers.  The serving was quite large for the price.   The kicker that made me really dislike my experience and the server was what happened next.  Both my friend with the ravioli and myself like A LOT of grated cheese on our entrees.  To the point that people will tease and said \"have a little pasta with your cheese).  Granted my friend REALLY puts a ton of cheese on her entree, but that is how SHE likes it.  It's no one's business.   There was a different girl handling the cheese grating job. She was VERY nice, considerate, helpful and accommodating.  She ended up running out of cheese and had to get more.   When she got back she was grating cheese over my plate and our so-called server came back to the table by now.  She saw the girl putting the cheese on my entree and said \"That's going to be $10 extra\" ( a comment I found completely inappropriate and nasty).  So, I responded \"And that will come out of you tip\"!!  At that she didn't say anything...no apology or anything.  She just walked away.  One of the woman had brought a cake which they let us keep in the kitchen and they did not charge a cake cutting fee, which was nice.   Overall I was not impressed. No one complained to management because they didn't want to make a scene during our friend's birthday.  But I was tempted, especially after that servers very rude and inappropriate comment. Had we'd been regulars and she had a \"relationship\" with us, then the comment might have been funny.  However, to a group of people who don't dine there on a regular basis nor know her that was uncalled for!!  For a sit down restaurant in a casino the prices were okay, but I really wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again.   I think the buffet would be where I'd end up next time."}
{"text":"I was hopeful that the food would be good; my veal scallopini was tough and the pasta lukewarm.  It had a lemony taste...more like piccata, so I was suspicious that they had made an error and tried to cover it up.  My companion's rigatoni with sausage and meatballs ...well, to quote him,\"I could've forgiven the cold and tough rigatoni, but then the sausage was cold, and finally the meatball was uncooked in the center. THAT did it for me!\""}
{"text":"I have been here two times. The first time I enjoyed what I've eaten as it was a veal pasta. The second time I also enjoyed my meal as it was a customized pizza. As tasty as the meals were, I recall waiting right by the restaurant for about 45 minutes just so I can be seated. After I was seated, I remember service being considerably slow the second I was there, and for the quality of the food, I may as well have eaten something that usually decent portions. The next time I will eat inside of a Sunset restaurant, it will be wise to make sure that the servers are ready by the time I arrive."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great and the food was delicious. One bad thing was that the emergency alarm went off for like 20 minutes at the casino. Everybody ignored it and continued eating. I wish they stopped the alarm sooner so people can eat more peacefully."}
{"text":"Not too stuck on the Clam Linguini had recently as I found it was edged with fresh clam shells but appeared to be interior a large portion canned and very watery at the bottom of dish. The bread was great, the ambiance and decor and music lovely and the Chef has done wonderful things with the Desserts for Special Occasions so I still give it a 3."}
{"text":"It is very simple food, and you probably could find the same dishes prepared in the buffet.  No offense to anyone who enjoys this restaurant, however, I would challenge you to expand your culinary horizons..."}
{"text":"My husband and I have always liked this place.  They have added many items to their menu since our last visit, and there is a lot of variety.  I had the spaghetti with pistachio pesto and it was authentic and fresh.  The bread is fresh and hot and everything tastes great.  We like the atmosphere of the restaurant being open to the casino, yet it also feels like you are sitting outside.  One of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Wow!  We rolled the die and this is the restaurant that was chosen.    I was nervous after reading all of these negative reviews about the place and just hoped we would have a good dinner, it didnt matter since it was not our choice to bail or not.  We were seated right at 5 when we have reservations and our friend was late and we told the waiter Jose that we needed to wait for her and could we just have water for now and he was super nice and patient--our friend came 10 mins late and we ordered soda and appetizers, they brought complimentary bread w/butter and that was really good, nice seasoning.  The calamari was really tender which for me is a BIG deal and very hard to find, many places its rubbery and hard to chew and we also ordered some mozz sticks which were good.  The die made us each get different entrees, Baked Penne for our friend and she loved it, I had meatballs and polenta which was creamy and very tasty.  In fact everyone tried each others dishes and mine was the winner of the three   :D  My other friend chose the chicken parm and he loved it.  They were very attentive the entire time and the restaurant which sits on the edge of the casino was nice, it had casino noise of course but it wasnt outrageous or crazy at all and I didnt smell any smoke, I have severe allergies and I was fine.    It was clean, comfortable, there are only tables, no booths which normally is a negative to me but it was fine and the menu wasnt very big which was a bad thing right off for us but crap it was amazing what they did have so no complaints!  Dessert?   Their tiramasu was amazing!!!!  Lemon sorbet was good and cheesecake was good.     For all that we ate it came to $94  That is GREAT!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"service is a little slow, but the huge portions and the small prices make up for it!!! the chicken parm is my fav and its always delicious!"}
{"text":"Really impressed with the food, service, and atmosphere for being a restaurant inside a local casino.  Its a hidden gem inside a rough casino. And its quality foodservice comparable to Maggianos and Olive Garden for half the price. Definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"If I were rating the service and ambiance only, there would be no stars.  The food saved the night. Don't ya just love it when the waitresses' first words are \"how are you guys?\" to a table of two men, two women?  Gross!   Long wait (over ten minutes) til order taken.  Staff seemed short handed and unprepared to handle the crowd, and it wasn't even six o'clock yet.   Tried to order a glass of Burgundy, waitress says they don't serve Burgundy (What?!!!) She leaves table and returns with Burgundy, saying they cook with it (no joke!) Server brings basket of ugly, very plain, pseudo breadsticks (but they're not...geez, not sticks, yuck.  Come on people, small, long loafs of tastelss, bland, mushy dough are NOT breadsticks!).  We ask the server and our waitress for regular bread...\"we only have breadsticks\" is the reply.  Server brings my soup and, low and behold, what's that on my plate?  A SLICE OF BREAD!! (lightly toasted, very thin)  Asked him for more bread and he brings a plate of five slices. Food was good...just soured by poor customer service, ugly room (including the putrid green seating in the booths) What looked like a manager spent our entire meal conversing with a couple at a nearby table, and he, along with rest of staff, never asked the usual \"is everything ok?, are you enjoying your meal?\", etc. Needless to say, but I'll say it anyway...we won't be back."}
{"text":"Ask and yee shall receive! The waitress Michelle  and the hostess remembered us from our last visit. Last night, the food was delicious- not over salted as our previous visit!  I thank the hostess for making a point to speak with the kitchen!  Service great, food great- Need I say more! Try it!  Good job, Ladies!"}
{"text":"The food was good tonight. But the waiter is another story . I asked him for another glass of root beer and the waiter said ( I have other tables) like I don't know that . You don't telll your customers that at all . I just made a comment he asked if I wanted the check and said yes , unless you are paying for it . He said in a very rude tone NO IM NOT PAYING FOR IT . I was just joking around with him . It took him over 20 minutes to bring 2 togo boxes"}
{"text":"This will be the worst review I've ever posted and hopefully ever do on a restaurant    From the moment we walked in the service was questionable.  The waitress seemed overly aggressive suggesting to avoid a citrus drink one of my dinner mates wanted to order which we actually listened to because she works there. She also insisted all the food was good but then proceeded to point out a handful of dishes she thought we should order.  The drinks actually didn't take too terribly long to arrive, but the water and breadsticks took way too long.  Almost 20 minutes for water and a bit longer for our Breadsticks.  Our salads arrived after nearly 40 minutes and were drenched in the various salad dressings that had been asked for.  It should be noted that one of my dinner mates ordered minestrone soup and was happy with it.  Another sent her salad back asking for the dressing on the side which didn't arrive for over 10 minutes and the rest of the party had finished their salad/soup.  We all had finished our cocktails and the dishes and empty glasses stayed piled up on our table.  By the end of the meal we never were asked if we wanted refills on our cocktails or water.   After waiting for what was over an hour since we placed our original order we were able to wave our waitress down and ask were our meals were.  She asked if we were in a hurry and had a show to attend to which we responded yes we had a show to attend in 1/2 hour.  Our meals finally appeared after 10 more minutes.  Sadly all of our meals were completely subpar.  Fettuccine with chicken the noodles seemed microwaved (cold and hard on top hot in the middle) chicken was tough, veal was cold and tough, risotto was undercooked and hard, sauce was almost nonexistent.  I really couldn't believe this meal was happening so poorly.  None of us ate more than 2-3 bites.  We complained to the server and the manager who offered us a free dessert which we declined.  I mean with the food already so awful why would we want more?  We asked for our ticket so we could just end this horrible experience.  I must note that the manager did give us a 25% discount though we didn't ask for it, but I do appreciate the effort."}
{"text":"Fantastic decor, really a nice place to eat dinner at. Best thin crust pizza I've ever had. They know to do thin crust. Nice and crispy.   The service is impeccable and my drink was refilled several times without my asking. The bread is delicious also.   If you want some place quiet, this isn't it. It opens up into the casino. But it isn't super loud and if you sit near the back it's much better.    I really like the way this restaurant presents itself. The staff seem to really care about you having a good meal. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Pasta Cucina is an Italian restaurant located inside Boulder Station casino. My friend invited my boyfriend and I to join her and her hubby for dinner. She made a reservation for 7:30pm on Friday 7/1/16.    The ambiance here is nice, but misleading. You walk in and it looks like you are about to have a 5 star meal. Dim lighting, cozy booths, comfy seats with cloth napkins, fancy fancy! Our server for the evening was Quentin and he was the best part of the meal. We ordered drinks  and then breadsticks with warm marinara and alfredo dipping sauces were brought to the table. To me, it's a red flag when alfredo is brought out for free, because that is usually a more sought after sauce. Everywhere else that serves Alfredo is usually extra $$$ if you want it on the side. I dipped a breadstick into the sauce and found that it was very goopy and had thick clumps. Ah ha! This is why it's free. I enjoyed the marinara more and that is rare because I love alfredo sauce. We ordered some appetizers to start, the fried mozzarella and the meatball sliders. The mozzarella came out so fast and it was lukewarm. The cheese didn't even stretch when you pulled it apart. The sliders looked better than they tasted. The meatballs were not all that.   We ordered our entrees a short time later. I was going to get the alfredo, that is before I tried it, so I decided to get linguini and clams. My boyfriend got the baked penne and our friends got the veal and chicken parmesans. All entree's came with either a salad or minestrone soup. I chose the salad with the house dressing. I expected an Italian dressing but instead got a sweet dressing. It wasn't bad, but not what I was expecting. Then the entree's came out. I had about two bites of mine and I was done. It was not good at all. I have had linguini and clams before, and it was flavorful. This dish, although it was supposed to have wine, garlic, and butter tasted like mop water. Quentin could tell I wasn't enjoying my food and asked me if I would like anything else. I ended up getting the baked penne my boyfriend had. Now that was good. There was lots of cheese and sausage and meatballs mixed throughout. I would order that again. All in all, if you are looking for good Italian food, skip this place. You're better off going to Olive Garden."}
{"text":"The food was really good...but the menu was really basic. But the prices on there menu was unbeatable."}
{"text":"Took wife to Il Vino for her birthday. Atmosphere was decent for a casino restaurant. Our waiter, Zach, was attentive but not overbearing. I had lasagna and wife had manicotti. Both were very good. Nice size portions that we had to pack to take home since we could not eat it all. Excellent bread sticks. The moscato wine was superb.  Very affordable dinner as well."}
{"text":"AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME Been to this one multiple times and the one at Palace but the Palace Station one sucks sucks sucks  Have to give it 5 stars for exceeding expectations by a ridiculous amount. It's not in the nicest part of town, hell it's also in a casino, but once your inside MOST of that doesn't matter. Once there were a couple trashy women in torn jean shorts and dirty white tees, blech.  Of course went on a date-  Anyway... food gets 3.5 stars for being above average and prices are surprisingly low for the portions.  Service = 5 stars, the waiter we had (and ask for) was excellent. Far better than you would think, i had to leave an exceptional tip he was attentive, genuinely wanted to be there and serve, and somehow convinced us to get dessert which is rare for me to agree with! (He wheeled out a dessert cart, which looked yummy, and we had the canoli? and it was superb!) Once had a female who seemed un-enthused but lets let that one slide.  Decor gets a 5, really really set the romantic mood and just being there made me and my girl giddy and cute right off the bat.  WORTH IT, GREAT TIME more than once!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant! The prices are amazing, breadsticks are immensely better than Olive Garden's, soup and salad are delicious, and entrees are superb. By far my Italian go-to all the time!"}
{"text":"Seated by a young lady with a very tight dress. Ok if you are in to such things I guess.  Greeted by the waitress, ordered water.  I had the lasagna and ate it all, very good.  Gus had the Scampi. the noodles were covered in some kind of glue. We came to that conclusion when he tried to take a bite and the whole glob came out of the plate at once, no way to get a few noodles. The shrimp were ok since that is all he ate.  I am not sure if we stank or something but the waitress would place the food down and was gone in a flash, kind of odd."}
{"text":"heavy on the portions, light on the wallet. so, yeah, i'm a fan!  seriously, the portions are so huge that we have yet to try their dessert! =o)  we always get great service. we always get the same quality food. we are never disappointed. there's nothing better than consistency at a restaurant especially when it's consistently good.  hint: eat at the bar cuz they have a $3 small plates menu as well as $5 pizzas.  our faves: seafood linguini mac n cheese fried ravioli caprese salad calamari tuscan angel hair  the pasta is always al dente which, in my book, makes or breaks an italian joint. soggy, over cooked pasta is the absolute worst (i.e. olive garden, macaroni grill, maggiano's)!  il vino is my choice for tasty, inexpensive, italian food!"}
{"text":"It was my first time Dinning in and the Service is wonderful. I ask him what dish that he would recommend. I end up taking Bistecca Alla Pizzaiola and Veal Ossi Buco. It was very good both of the meat cook well, like he said falls off the bone."}
{"text":"We live in town and had gone to the movies. Stopped in here to eat when we saw they had balsamic and fig pizza. It was awesome! We loved every bite! Their bread was delicious too. We will come back again after another movie."}
{"text":"With tickets for the Railhead (John Waite!) in one hand, and the other hand resting on my hungry belly, we decided to try Boulder Station's Pasta Palace.  Our luck has been mixed when it comes to the Italian places at Station casinos in the past. San Lorenzo, at Texas Station, was delicious and simple with A+ service. (Then they changed the menu. Fiends.) Capri, at Sunset Station, was as uninviting in taste as it was in decor and the  demeanor of its host. Pasta Palace at Palace was quite good the first time, but on the second visit we experienced a case of \"glad we had a coupon.\" We went to PP at Boulder with no expectation other than Chef Boyardee not to be in residence.  From the moment we were greeted at the podium, the staff made us feel graciously welcome. Our waitress was warm and professional, making useful suggestions (such as turning our lemonades into raspberry or strawberry lemonades - not on the menu) while also being cheerfully clear about cost ($1 extra, unlimited refills).  As we sat in our (comfy, and we're both \"fluffy\" people) booth, I noted with a mental thumbs up how well the dining area is laid out. Spacious distance between booths/tables, and cozy, dark elements in a casual but tasteful design.  One corner of the restaurant is open to the working back area of the Metro Pizza operation next door. It doesn't detract from the ambiance, being away from the main dining area, but I do wonder if Metro fulfills Pasta Palace's pizza orders.  One of our assistant waiters (we had two or three) made a small mistake with our drinks - no big deal - but I was impressed with how apologetic both he and our head waiter were. Who cares about a little mistake when your servers are obviously so committed to you having a great meal?  Wait, you may say something to yourself, isn't this a two-star review? She sounds so comfortable and happy. What gives?  I know, and my clicky finger does hover over the three-star (\"A-OK\") mark just because, darn, it was so nice there, surrounded by friendly people and endless raspberry lemonades, but... but... the food. The food. (Dramatic, \"hands are tied\" frownie face of disappointment goes here.)  Of all the Station properties, the food at this Pasta Palace had to be the most bland and cheap-tasting. My husband's rigatoni tasted like it came from a packet - you know that sort of gummy taste? Like that. I leaned across the table. \"Does yours even have sauce?\" Like me, he'd gone for a mix of alfredo and marinara sauces, neither of which brought out anything good about the other on this occasion. Nothing sharp, nothing mellow - nothing really at all. (So it's just as well that his pasta was barely coated in it.)  I had the cheese ravioli. \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" (That's me quoting Yelp's two-star catchphrase.) I'd shrug if I were eating it at home, in front of the television, probably slugging on the salt and pepper with the hand not holding the remote. At a restaurant, though, I expect a sensation beyond \"Yes, I'm swallowing an inoffensive wet lump.\"  We did like the salads for having a little more artichoke and banana pepper, etc., than you might get at, say, Olive Garden. The bread basket was warm and fine, if a little uninventive. (Garlic sticks, not very buttery, and somewhat dry foccacia, no flatbreads.)  It could be that we ordered \"poorly.\" Maybe Pasta Palace delivers on the promises of its setting and staff with a few great dishes that we missed. I don't really accept that excuse, though: if it's on the menu, I expect it to be decent, and my one clear definition of \"decent\" is \"has some value beyond what you could easily get from a packet or can.\"  Because the food was so unremarkable if not a little gluey/heavy/icky for us, I can't quite nudge myself to that third star. (Three stars implies that we might go back.) But, if you're looking for good service and good lemonade, and your pasta expectations can be met by what I described above, then give Boulder's Pasta Palace a try. The dessert tray did look rather delicious."}
{"text":"The first time my family and I had dinner here last year, the food was great and service was also fantastic.  With this in mind, my boyfriend said he wanted to try the place out when we were gaming that night.  It was a holiday weekend so it was busier than normal. We did not have a reservation and they took his number to text us when our table was ready. Now, he grew up working in food service and was an assistant manager in a fine dining restaurant so his standards are much higher. He was not happy with our visit. I had a salad and it was wilted and brown. How does this happen?  It was not even hidden on the bottom, it was on top of the dish.  We asked for a second order of breadsticks four times. Four. They brought them when we had received our check which threw him over the edge and he did not have nice things to say to the poor girl that brought them out. In her defense, we never asked her for breadsticks during the fiasco, but how do three people, four times, forget a simple request?  Besides that, our server was there to refill our drinks and glasses of wine. The entree was ok but I should have ordered the chicken Marsala like I had last time. All it takes is one bad experience, and my boyfriend refuses to go back. Plus, we are moving out of the neighborhood so it will be out of our way anyways."}
{"text":"If you like Olive Garden, you'll love Pasta Cucina except for the TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!  Our waiter was present to take our orders, never refilled our water, didn't deliver our food, didn't check on us, and straight up disappeared.  We waited almost 20 minutes to get our checks after we finished and had to ask one of the bussers to find the guy.  While staying at Sunset Station, I saw an ad for Pasta Cucina and decided to try it out.  I went with a couple friends and we ordered the Meatball Sliders, Fried Mozzarella, Baked Penne, and Lasagna.  Nothing exceptional, but all edible.  FYI: the penne, lasagna, and breadsticks keep well in the fridge for a few days and heat up well!  Each item was under $10, which was cool!  If someone wanted to go sometime, I'd consider going, but I'm not really going out of my way to return."}
{"text":"Food is delicious!!! We usually go here for holidays and are always satisfied. Always excited for a meal here!! The Chicken Alfredo is amazing!! I also like how they bring two sauces to dip your bread sticks in. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Sad to say, on our last visit, it sucked here!  First off, when I opened my cloth napkin it was stuck together with blue gum.  As was my daughters.  We were a party of five so two out of five isn't too bad.  Disgusting but whatever.  The waitress when we point them out said ''oh, we never know what happens at the cleaners.''  Huh?  How did you wrap the silverware in the napkin without noticing??  Got the basket of bread sticks and the two dipping sauces. Two out of the eight bread sticks were moldy.  I'm talking grey mold!!  I asked to see the manager.  When he finally showed he said ''oh, those have to be replaced.''  Not one single I'm sorry.  Then the moldy bread sticks were never replaced.  So, as we're packing up our leftovers I asked the waitress if we could have two bread sticks to take home.  ''Oh sure'', she said ''but we charge for bread sticks to go.''  Okay, by then I was peeved so I said ''how about two bread sticks to replace the moldy bread sticks that were promised by the manager?''  That manager never, ever came near us again to apologize or offer us a discount or a free dessert or anything!!!!!  We have eaten here many times and it's always been just okay.  Not terrific or wonderful, just okay.  Needless to say we will not eat here again nor will we recommend the place. Just yuck!!!"}
{"text":"We only came here because we had $30 worth in coupons which we didn't want to waste. I don't remember how we got them but they were about to expire.  Showed up with no reservation and ended up waiting for close to an hour just for a table to free up. Once seated we were giving menus and never checked on for half an hour, no drinks or something to munch on. After placing our orders we waited again this time for almost an hour, I was this much to just leaving remembered about those coupons.  The service was so incredibly slow.   As for the food, it was pretty OK and portions were nice. Prices wasn't that bad, most dishes were around $10 with some a bit more because it was seafood.  We had the grilled chicken broccoli (liked), linguini and clams (disliked), shrimp scampi (disliked), and another dish which was the chef's special  of the night (liked).    Appetizers were fresh tomato bruschetta, $6.99 was a bit pricey and nothing special for  4 tiny pieces considering unlimited bread sticks and dipping sauce was only $3.99. Which the server didn't even mention or recommend, how do you know even mention bread sticks when eating pasta especially with olive oil and balsamic vinegar on the table.  Most places this would be complementary.   And after almost 3 hours from beginning to end we probably could have gone upstairs to their buffet and have just as good pasta made with other kinds of food in half that time."}
{"text":"My husband and I have gone here a few times and loved it. Healthy portions, good taste, nice wait staff and a manager who is often visible and both times has checked on us to see how our meal was. We were waited on by a sweet girl named Jessica both visits and will definitely dine with her again. Prices are reasonable and My husband and I have learned to order just one dinner and share it or take home leftovers. The only thing I wish was different about the place is that because it is open to the Casino you can hear the Casino music."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, not good.  The services was slow - very slow.....like \"send up a flare to get their attention\" slow.  Ordered an appetizer of their breadsticks & dipping sauces to begin.  Not use to paying for bread - but here's the thing...the bread is complimentary, but they don't just bring it to the table, they want to see if you'll pay $4.00 for this appetizer....Well it's $4. for sauce, and it's not all that great of sauce...so really, the bread is fine on it's own.  Hubby ordered the Veal Scallopini - served with Spinach...he was looking forward to the spinach, and how one can ruin spinach is beyond me...but they did.  He actually tried twice to eat it, thinking maybe it wasn't that bad.  The second bite, I thought he was going to \"lose his cookies\" at the table.   The Veal Scallopini was good - not great, not bad, just average.  I ordered the Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo with sundried tomatoes and mushrooms I  believe (it's been a week)  - A staple at most Italian restaurants.  It was not good.  I can't even say it was average.  I ended up not feeling well, and went back up to the room for the rest of the evening.    Basically, if you go to any of the restaurants at Sunset Station, stick with Hooters, or Fatburger - those were fabulous, the other restaurants were poor in quality & service."}
{"text":"Pasta Cucina USED to be an easy five star in my books. My family would visit all the time. Unfortunately, they changed... If you're used to Pasta Cucina, be warned!  They no longer have the breadsticks with marinara and alfredo. This was a staple to Pasta Cucina and they replaced it with a generic loaf of bread.   The salads no longer come with the meal... they're now ala carte. $9 for a salad on top of my meal. This isn't exactly \"fine dining,\" so I'll pass.   They took veal parmesan off of the menu. This was a huge disappointment to me. The eggplant was like mush, so be careful!  The waitress was wonderful, I will give them that. The manager didn't care about our dissatisfaction. He comped the eggplant which was beyond generous, but it would have been nice to provide honest feedback to the management team. We used to be loyal patrons; some management would find our feedback valuable."}
{"text":"Pasta Cucina was a favorite of mine in the past.  It was good food with good value.  Recent menu change not only brings new items (good thing) but the removal of favorites, higher prices and a complete ala carte menu.  I ordered the tortellini  had 2 bites and sent it back.  Spoke to the manager and he acted like he did not care and was doing me a favor by removing my two bite meal.  While there I saw at leas 2 tables get up and leave."}
{"text":"I must be honest as this is possibly the poorest tasting Italian food I've ever had The red sauce tasted like ketchup, the chicken parm was burnt and the Alfredo sauce literally had no taste. No cheese or cream flavor. The Italian soda was good but shadowed by the poor service We even had to wait 15 minutes for a table in half full restaurant Don't waster your time. Olive Garden is better value"}
{"text":"Wonderful! My husband and I came here before a movie, we were in and out within an hour. I ordered the lemon basil chicken, which was phenomenal. I decided to try a watermellon Italian soda, which was yummy. I would have loved to try more of the flavors. Waiter (Christopher) was great about checking in on us. I felt the prices were more than reasonable. I would recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a great Italian meal."}
{"text":"The saving grace of this restaurant was the pizza I ordered. Otherwise this establishment would have totally received one star for the sub par visit. Walked in on a Saturday evening and was seated immediately. I thought that this was awesome and hopefully was a start to a good evening. Fast forward 10-15 minutes before our waiter got there to order our drinks (alcoholic beverages were also bad)  I ordered the pepperoni pizza (safest choice) and my wife ordered shrimp scampi. I really enjoyed the pizza (so much so I ate the whole thing) but my wife really didn't like hers at all  The breadsticks they offer you have minimal flavor and the dipping sauce tastes as if it came out of a can that was already open for a week.   Overall not a good experience and will definitely never return."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from my parents, since my uncle and aunt took my father here for his birthday. Apparently, my uncle and aunt stopped by here before church a few months back and the food wasn't so great. However, there are some things in life you give another chance to and this place was one of them. My relatives came back here this month and discovered a whole new restaurant. Recently remodeled and also revamped the recipes for their menu. It's like a Restaurant Impossible episode and walking in after they're done.   My relatives won't go here almost every single day after work, if this place wasn't exceptionally consistent with their flavors.  My uncle absolutely Loves their Linguini and Clams. He can eat this every single day if he could. They also dined here when I went , but with all their church members and even the pastor. My aunt wouldn't even dare bring my father here for his birthday or church members to embarrass themselves if this place wasn't great. So for those reasons alone, I ignored the low star ratings and wanted to try this place for myself and go by my experience, instead of others. I'm SO glad I did. Even my brother that just drove from CA and had my leftovers was telling me this is some good pasta, where is this place? Honestly, the location/casino is a two star, but this restaurant itself is a hard bright five stars in my book of good eats.   My parents and I were greeted by Luigi Perez, the GM of Pasta Cucina. He opened the doors and we were promptly seated in a cozy, lime color booth. I loved our U-shaped table and the finishing gloss gave it a soft touch to its exterior. Even the seat was comfy and not sunk in, where you shrink five inches or so. Our server, Jay warmly greeted us and asked if we wanted anything to drink and if we would like to start with any appetizers. He recommended a few and we chose the Calamari.  Here's what we tried:  Complimentary Breadsticks - Fluffy and soft.. goes great with any pasta dishes that you want to dip and soak this bread in... especially the Seafood Linguini's Sun-Dried Tomato Broth!!! Yes!  Appetizer - Calamari Fritti Hand breaded calamari quick fried and served with marinara sauce and hot vinegar peppers. *I was quite impressed! So light and tasted so fresh, I forgot it's even fried!!! The sliced vinegar peppers are such a great addition to this appetizer. There was a nice acidic bite, which combined with the thick, delicious marinara sauce made this a wonderful start to a memorable meal. The sauce had red chili flakes on top, which gave it a flavorful kick! Couldn't help, but dip dip dip some more to get the full effect! YUM :)  Entrees:   Lobster Cannelloni - Light pasta stuffed with lobster and mascarpone cheese.  Baked in a tomato, cream sauce and served with parmesan crouton. *My Father ordered this entree on his birthday and ordered it Again when we went. I don't blame him.. I had a bite and it was all over. The sauce reminds me of a flavorful fettuccine sauce, without the overpowering richness of the cream. The lobster and cheese were a hearty filling that was just delightful to indulge in. My Father cleaned this dish up and left nothing behind.   Chicken Marsala - The traditional favorite with button mushrooms and sweet marsala wine, served with linguini. *The chicken was ever so tender, the sauce had the perfect blend of butter, olive oil, Marsala, and spices. I like that it comes with linguini that my Mother says it reminds her of tasty jjajangmyeon. ( Korean noodle dish ) The texture of the pasta was al dente and together made a marvelous dish.  Seafood Linguini - Shrimp, clams, mussels, calamari, and salmon sautéed and finished with sun-dried tomato broth. *It was tantalizing to see.. the portion was beyond generous in seafood and pasta. The aroma, itself was mouth watering! I was just happy to look at this grand masterpiece of pure food beauty. Sexy and this dish knows it! I couldn't wait to dig in and my first reaction was silence. It was so good, I wanted to savor this wondrous moment just for the sake of pleasuring my taste buds. Oh.... YEAaaaaahuuuh. Astonishing flavors, the broth was heartfelt tranquility... I sighed every time I finished a bite. The pasta was cooked perfectly! Loved the texture. I couldn't be more happier with what I ordered and I was so tempted to order one maybe two.. three to go :P In Linguini World... this one.. ROCKED!   Dessert - Tiramisu *Another generous portion and the thickness was joyously made. Even the bitterness of the chocolate syrup went well together with this creamy, lightly sweet dessert.  Service was excellent. The GM stopped by a few times to check up on us to see if everything was okay and how our entrees tasted. Our server, Jay was easy going, friendly, funny, and made our experience fun. Our busser was attentive in taking away our plates or when refills were needed. Even the hostess thanked & wished us a good night. Sunshine smiles and happy tummy are what we left with :D"}
{"text":"Customer service is great, ambiance is nice, the food is pretty good for the price which is inexpensive."}
{"text":"Limited non-pasta menu but the pasta dishes were good and the breadsticks were a little doughy but good as well.  Portions were large.  I would grade the food a four star but the menu a two star.  Staples such as any salad for a main course and in particular Seafood Salad, Chicken Milanese, etc. aren't to be found."}
{"text":"I feel like this place has been severely underrated, not only was my meal fantastic, our server, Jose, was attentive and friendly. Nobody in our party of 5 was disappointed with their meal. Everything from our appetizer, the bruschetta, to salads, breadsticks with dipping sauces, and entrees were scrumptious with the perfect portion sizes. Definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a good meal in Sunset Station."}
{"text":"I actually read the Yelp reviews for Pasta Cucina AFTER I finished my meal and was really surprised that so many people rated them poorly.  My food was good, service was friendly and the prices were excellent.  We'd decided to go out for an inexpensive dinner and after looking at the Stations Casinos specials page, decided to go with Pasta Cucina at the Sunset since it's nearby.    There was a short wait, but it wasn't bad for a Friday dinner (about 20 min).  We had a drink in the Gaudi bar and waited patiently.  We were called and seated near the kitchen, which was really loud, but interesting to watch.  We were pleased to see that all of the food was being cooked to order.    I ordered the Boarding Pass special (choice of a pasta dish special, salad, bread and a glass of house wine for $9.99 - you have to ask for the special menu).  Ravioli Bolognaise, salad and house red.  My husband got Spaghetti Bolognaise with meatballs and a glass of red (not a special, but he was craving meatballs).    The food came reasonably quickly and was surprisingly good.  The Bolognaise sauce was excellent, the house salad dressing was light and zesty.  My one disappointment was that the pasta was premade.  My raviolis were clearly frozen.  But, I would have been amazed it if wasn't.  This was exactly what it promised to be: tasty, inexpensive Italian food.  Those that compare it to the Olive Garden aren't wrong.  It's the same concept.  The difference is that this food isn't microwaved."}
{"text":"I want to give a BIG THANK YOU to Pasta Cucina. My sister celebrated her 24th wedding anniversary there. I wanted to surprise her with flowers so I called the restaurant and the hostess said I could bring them. I asked because I wasn't sure about bringing large tall vases. The reservation was at 6:00pm and I showed up at 5:30 with my flowers and vases to find that the table was already set up for our party of 20 people. The manager (didn't get his name) approached me and right away asked if I needed to fill the vases with water. They were very helpful and I decorated the table in  no time. Our server Kari gave us outstanding customer service. She was very attentive from the moment we got there. Thank you so much Pasta Cucina Team we had an amazing time. We really enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try Il Vino Cucina and Wine Bar at Aliante Station for dinner tonight. We had been to the previous occupant of the space, Pips, once about a year and a half ago. It was good, but the prices never got us back in. After trying Il Vino, I can tell you we will definitely be back.  We started with their Antipasti Appetizer. The fried zucchini was good if you dipped it in the included marinara sauce, but otherwise had limited flavor. The bruschetta was yummy, but the fried mozzerella was OMG good. It was still creamy and yummy even though it wasn't flaming hot, like you see in most restaurants.   My wife had the Chicken Cannelloni. The flavor was good, but my wife found it a little dry for her taste, almost like it needed a little more sauce inside the shells. I had the chicken parm. So good. I know it's hard to screw up, but the chicken was well-seasoned and moist. The marinara sauce was amazingly good.  Haley, the General Manager stopped by to say hi, and we couldn't resist chatting with her. She was very open to feedback. There are a couple of kinks they are working out (some of the Italian sodas on their menu they don't actually carry), but otherwise, it was a good dinner.  The prices were more than reasonable and portions were adequate, but not obscene. This could very easily become a solid neighborhood Italian restaurant in an area that is underserved."}
{"text":"Two Martinis  Two salads  Bread Fried Mozzarella  Two Entrees  $35  All of it was awesome!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, especially for the price and the atmosphere is nice. The best part about it is the service. We had some of the best service I have ever had while dining at Pasta Cucina. Literally from beginning to end. The hostess was engaging and polite. Our server took the time to ask about us and get to know us, and the food runner was funny and entertaining. There was great energy flowing through all of them. They were a great team and we thoroughly delightful. Thank you so very much! :)"}
{"text":"So babe talk me into getting the shrimp lobster ravioli and it was pretty good. Along with my Caesar salad with all the extra toppings was delicious..Oh can't forget about the bread and the thin crust pizza the best pizza ever.. The customer service was great.  But none the less we will be back.."}
{"text":"This is a very traditional Italian restaurant, and I stuck with the basics of a caesar salad and spaghetti with meatballs.  The salad was very good, as was the spaghetti and the meatballs were excellent.  For dessert, I had the cannoli and that was also above average.   Prices are very reasonable, as dinner for two, that included dessert for both of us, was only around $44. I will gladly come back here again."}
{"text":"When El Vino first opened and up until recently they have been my favorite but things are staring to go downward decline in thier cooking. The staff seams service is still exceptional but the cooking has changed. I hope they go back to what made them great,  I ate thier last night and was not impressed."}
{"text":"we decided to come here, since we were still hungry after the movie.  I would have to say its a decent place to eat.  Kind of unique in its own way, but overall its a good place.    Located inside Aliante Station Casino, the restaurant has a very well setting of the place.  The entrance way, was basically a big glass door.  On one side of the restaurant, it has the bar and the other side, had its sit down restaurant.  I did like the color scheme, even though it was kind of dark.  But the material on the seats and the booth, seems very nice.    Once the placed open, I think we were probably the first customers in the restaurant.  We were greeted at the front desk, and was sitted right away.  Our waiter was very pleasant and gave us time to read over the menu.  I started with a Strawberry Italian Soda, which was very good.  The wife had Italian Soda with whip cream, and it look very interesting.  A few minutes later, our waiter came back and took our order.  We started with Mozeralla triangles, then we ordered the pepperoni pizza and a Fettucini Alfredo with chicken.  We basically shared, since we were still half full from the popcorn and soda from the movie.    While we were waiting with our food, we got a basket of bread sticks, which was delicious.  Once the Mozeralla Triangles came in, it was really good.  I like the fact that it was more of a melted cheese.  Unlike cheese sticks that comes out in one big glob of cheese.  At least with these triangles, you can surely get cheese in every bite.  I loved them.  When our pizza and fettucini came out, it did look very good and presented very well.  The pizza was stove baked, and thin, which looked really good.  I did try it, and it was okay.  A bit on the greasey side, but okay.  The crust itself was crunchy, a bit hard, but edible.  The fettucini on the other hand, was awesome, I did like how it was present, and it wasn't totally covered in alfredo sauce, it was just the right amount for me.  Unfortunately I didn't finish the fettucini, but my wife did the next day.    We had to take everything to go, since it was more then we can handle.  I was debating on dessert, cause we were stuff, but we decided to take a cheesecake to go instead.  The waiter was nice enough to bag everything for us.  Which was really nice of him.    Overall, it is a great place, a bit unsure on the pizza but from the look of the fettucini, it seems like they have a lot more to offer.  The pricing is decent, to a tad bit pricey.  But I believe you'll get your money's worth, with the food and the service.  Also, for those who see a movie before you go here, you can use your ticket stubs to get a free dessert.  Unfortunately I didn't use mine, cause it didn't really feel right using it, just to take it to go.  If I was going to sit there and eat it, then maybe.  But that's just me.  ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"Our first clue should have been that it was Friday night and there were only a few tables full.  This place has really gone downhill. They used to have excellent artisan breads, now you get breadsticks you can buy in a big bag at Albertsons for five bucks. They are warmed up and sprinkled with granulated garlic.  The house salad was generic and the spaghetti and meatballs couldn't give Chef Boyardee a run for his money.   The staff was professional, friendly and attentive.  Too bad the food they have to serve is so sub-par. Typical of big casino management trying to get by on the cheap. Granted the food is inexpensive but paying more to enjoy a good meal is worth it.  I would have done better to stay home with a jar of Ragù."}
{"text":"date night plus 10$ off coupon brought us to pasta cucina at sunset station :) there was a little bit of a wait but we had some business in the casino anyway! once we made it to our table we had very nice waitress who was very accommodating. we had looked at website beforehand so we knew what we wanted right away.(beware menu on sunset website has wrong prices) we were given bread stix with 2 dipping sauce (very good). for our order we had calamari for appetizer very good except needed a lot of additional flavor IE lemon and salt. for our entrees I had chicken and artichoke pasta. my man had the shrimp and lobster ravioli. came with Cesar salad. my pasta was cooked perfect just al dente enough was very lemony but i didn't mind that. ravioli came was chewy and delicious! we are planning to go back next time we have coupon! gonna try pizza next!"}
{"text":"The food tasted like those frozen dinners that you buy in the market. This has been the worst experience!! That's how terrible the food was."}
{"text":"My husband and I took a friend here from out of town, what an embarassment.  I had the lingune and clams and had to send it back because there was so much sand in the sauce.  My husband and our friend had the chicken marsala, (honest to god it tasted like liver).  Or waiter was giving us the heads up on what not to order, he said the lasagne was awful.  Everything was bad except the salad was ok.  Yeah the place is cheap, but we could not eat our meals.  I would NEVER eat here again even if it was free.  The Charcoal Room at the Sante Fe is excellent, it's pricey but it is worth it. This is the worst Italian food in Vegas, I wish someone would recommend a good Italian resturant."}
{"text":"Very good it's better than Olive Garden and next door oyster bar .. I got the salmon it was so good calamari best I ever had my husband got the veil very tender and good good pricing too .. Everything with drinks only 60$ amazing"}
{"text":"Based on the other reviews I read, I must have gone to the wrong restaurant. We had reservations for 8 pm on a Saturday night and there was only one other couple there. Even so it took 10 minutes to get service and that was only after I got up to find a server.  Our server never checked on us after our meal was presented, never made any suggestions and basically ignored us.   There were 7 of us and only two people finished their meals.  Mine was so over salted I couldn't eat it. Had our server come by to check on us, I could have told him. Ive had bad food before and bad service before, but never both at the same time."}
{"text":"We have been here several times because of the quality of food and the great prices but it seems they have changed their menu and went ala carte.  While the portions are huge the food is delicious, they have essentially doubled the cost of dining here.  In the past you would get a soup or salad with your meal, it's now extra.  They changed out their breadsticks with dipping sauce to just a plain loaf of bread with butter. Most of their staff is new as well so the familiar faces are gone and we just didn't feel the warm welcoming atmosphere we enjoyed. We typically visit Sunset Station because it values the local customer but the changes they have made are evidence that they are going in the same direction as strip properties.    We also enjoyed this location because the menu had many options and rivaled the Olive Garden menu without the long wait times and high prices; but now Olive Garden seems more appealing at least you still get a soup or salad."}
{"text":"This place was amazing.  The food was excellent, service was very good and the atmosphere was that of a much more expensive restaurant.  I had the shrimp scampi.  It was very good and easily had 30 shrimp in it for $13.99.  My wife had the chicken parm which was also very good.  It came with 2 large pieces of chicken and spaghetti for $10.99.  They had kid's meals for my children.  They even gave my son 3 scoops of gelato for free because he had just celebrated his birthday.  Today we purchased a coupon on weluvlocals.com where we paid $25 for $50 worth of food.  Me and my family can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I moved to the area about two months ago. We decided to go out to dinner and decided to check out Il Vino at Aliente. Neither of us had been the hotel/casino, let alone any of the restaurants. We used to be closer to Red Rock, so this will be our new hang out. When first entering the hotel/casino, we noticed how clean it was and that it didn't smell like a cloud of stale smoke.   When we found Il Vino, the décor and atmosphere were attractive and alluring. When you walk in there is a full service bar and a tasting area. We did not participate in the wine tasting by the ounce, but we have done the experience and this place looks like it would be fun to try it at. The have a large walk in wine chiller lit with purple lighting. We were seated within moments of walking in. There were probably fifteen people in the restaurant (staff included) when we arrived, which was a little after 8:00pm. I found it odd that the hostess asked for the name of the party. There was no one there and we were about to be seated, why did she need a name? She explained that she puts the name of the party in her system to show the table is occupied. Why you need a name to do that is beyond me.  At any rate, we were given the option of sitting at a table or a booth. I chose a booth and we were seated in a horseshoe-shaped booth. The booth's seats were well maintained; I didn't sink in and shrink once I sat down. I'm a short person, when the booth sinks in I have to sit on my leg as a booster, it's always nice when they keep the booths up to par. Small detail that I enjoyed, the back of the booths was upholstered with a fuzzy back. I feel it gave it a fun little flare.   Our server was Sunny. She got to our table and asked if we knew what we wanted to drink and asked if we knew what we wanted for appetizers. We ordered two glasses of wine (reasonably priced) and told her we needed a minute to make our food selections. Service was prompt and order was taken. We decided to order the Caprese Salad (Thick slices of juicy tomato and fresh mozzarella, served with fresh basil and extra virgin olive oil @ 7.99). While waiting on our appetizer, we were brought five bread sticks...not as good as Olive Garden's breadsticks (there's just something about those!) but they were nicely seasoned and toasted. Before we could eat too many bread sticks, our appetizer was brought out. She split the order onto two plates for us, which I thought was nice. The tomatoes were nice, ripe and juicy. It hard to mess up caprese, the tomatoes can make or break it...and it was delicious. My husband ordered the Rigatoni and Sausage (Rigatoni tossed with Italian sausage, ricotta cheese, meatballs and rich tomato sauce @ 10.99). I had a nibble but I'll go off of the \"mmmmmm\" sounds that he was making that the dish was good. We are Italian sausage lovers and he said the meatballs were better than the sausage.....rare for him to say. Meat Lasagna (Beef and sausage layered with thin pasta, and ricotta cheese then baked with marinara and mozzarella @ 9.99). A little subpar for my taste. My husband said it takes like lasagna....just pasta, meat and cheese. Maybe it's my grandmother's home cooking that's tainted my taste buds for good lasagna. I wanted there to be a little more flavor. Nothing in my dish gave me the \"mmmmmm\" factor....I should have went with the chicken parm. We each ordered another glass of wine and finished eating. The portions are good sizes, so we needed to go boxes. Sunny was there to check on us regularly and made sure our dishes were up to our standard. However, after we ordered our second glass of wine, Sunny started to get a little slower. She did get more tables in her section, but we noticed the time lag and decided against getting desert.   For four glasses of wine, an appetizer and two entrees, the bill was just under $55.00. We go to Buffalo Wild Wings on wing night and spend that much! Over all we had a great experience and would recommend this restaurant with thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Tim and I have passed this restaurant numerous times on the way to the Sunset Station buffet, and always thought that it looked like it was worth giving a shot. The decor is lovely, very similar to something one would see in The Forum Shops, and the smells coming from the kitchen always smell delicious.   One night, the buffet was just about to close, so we opted to try Capri instead. This was the beginning of the mistake.  We were seated in the center of the restaurant, and though there were only three other groups there, we weren't served for a good 5-10 minutes. When the waiter came, he was nice enough, though he seemed like he was always in a hurry, and would disappear into the kitchen for long periods of time.  The first thing we tried were the complimentary breadsticks that they give you. They were decent, but they're the EXACT SAME ONES YOU GET IN THE BUFFET! They poured us some olive oil and vinegar to dip the breadsticks in, but for Marinara or Alfredo dipping sauce they charge you $3.99. Ehhhh....no. On top of that, they only gave us three breadsticks,  and when we ran out it was like pulling teeth to get the basket refilled. Ultimately, the busboy grabbed some for us, who actually did a lot more work than our waiter.  It came time for the main course after a good half an hour or so. Tim ordered the Chicken Parmesan ($10.99) and I ordered a thin-crust pizza with Italian Sausage, Meatball, and Pepperoni ($10.99).   The Chicken Parmesan was pretty average. It tasted extremely bland, and the accompanying spaghetti was bathed in what tasted like plain tomato sauce.  The pizza was absolutely disgusting. For some reason, it smelled and tasted of seafood. I thought that I was just somehow mixing the smell of the neighboring table's lobster with my own food, but I took the leftovers home and heated them up to find the same taste and odor. COMPLETELY GROSS.  We opted to forgo dessert, because we could only imagine how terrible it would have been.  Overall, I would have to say that you'd be better off going to the buffet...or Fazoli's. I'm not one to necessarily support many major food chains, but even Fazoli's is better than this place. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"I had received my bi-monthly $10 free dining credit from the Station Casinos Player's Club, so I decided to try it out on this place.  I walked up to the host stand, and was greeted right away and sat only moments later. I wouldn't say this is necessarily the place you'd take a date, as there was something un-romantic about the place, but it was nice and quiet.  The waitress was a really nice older woman. She kept trying to convince me to get the special, though I was firm and ordered the Rigatoni Bolognese ($11).  While I waited for the main course, the bus-boy brought out a basket of bread with garlic butter. There were two types of bread in the basket, the breadsticks that one can find at any of the Station Casino buffets, and also some regular French Bread. They were both pretty good.  The Rigatoni Bolognese was actually pretty good. I liked the use of veal in the sauce, as it gave it a great flavor. The portion size was pretty decent too, and I was pretty well full by the end of the meal.   After all was said and done, with my coupon, I only owed $1.08. With the tip, this was still a pretty good deal.  Overall, average Italian food with average prices."}
{"text":"We used to really enjoy this place.  Went there last night and the food was just ok but the service was very good.  They gave the menus a facelift and that includes higher prices AND ala carte for salads and soup.  They took away the breadsticks with the 2 different sauces and just have bread and butter now.  The meals always included a salad or soup.   Now you are on your own.  My husband and I decided to share a Caesar salad and it was $9.00!   We had no appetizers--water for beverages, and shared a dessert and coffee.  The bill came to $54 plus tip!   Sorry but that's just NOT worth it.  They also cut the food portions because we used to have leftovers to take home but I just about finished my eggplant parm and my husband finished his lasagna.  They don't even give you a side of pasta anymore with your meal! Management's bright idea of trying to make this place more \"fancy and upscale\" by raising prices and taking food away and making portions smaller will hurt them.  We noticed last night a very empty restaurant.   It will be more emptier if we decide to give up on it too.  Sorry, great service is wonderful, but ripping off your patrons will not bring people back, no matter how great the service is.  We get a much better deal at Olive Garden and coupons too!!  Ciao Pasta Cucina!  You guys blew it!!!"}
{"text":"Service was awful, food was awful. Food came out cold, waitress spent more time checking her phone than checking on her tables. Don't waste your money or your time."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants in  Vegas that won't drain your wallet. Try their  Cesar salad,  also the stuffed Canneloni. Do not  forget to stop at the Oyster Bar  next door one of these nights also!"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant inside Aliante Station Casino but don't be intimidated by how fancy it looks. There's actually inexpensive but very good food there.   I like to sit at the bar whenever I come here to eat. The food comes out in a timely manner and portions are really big. I usually order the linguine and clams and have them make it with a spicy red sauce. It's not on the menu but they never hesitate to make it for me. It's very good and is one of my carb indulgences when I'm in that kinda mood. It always hits the spot for me. The breadsticks are good as well, I like to order a side of Alfredo to dip them in. All the salads I've tried are good and so is the minestrone soup. Like I mentioned before, really big portions so be prepared for leftovers if you want to do an appetizer and dinner.  They also have a small bites menu at the bar, but I usually overlook that cuz if I'm here I'm loading up on a big plate of pasta as if I'll be running a marathon the next day."}
{"text":"Texas station's Pasta Cucina just got a new chef and it shows.  The staff are very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"My first dinner at Pasta Cucina in Sunset Station, not sure why it took so long to finally try dining here, but I will say it was very good. Service was excellent and you never had to ask for more water in your glass. Empty plates were taken away promptly and overall the food was prepared perfectly. I just realized from the other Yelp reviews, that the red and white sauces on the table was for dipping your breadsticks, but since the bread kind of reminded me of the same breadsticks from Olive Garden and they don't offer dipping sauces (that I am aware of), I didn't put 2 and 2 together and just wondered what those sauces were for. I do like oil and balsamic vinegar for my Italian bread, but either it was too far away, not on the table or I just plain ole didn't see them, I didn't use them. The red moscatto wine was very light and fruity, if there was ever a wine geared for children this would probably be it!  Ceasar salad was good, nothing to write home about though. The fried mozzarella looked store bought, but the reviews here say they are freshly made in house. Caution, they are very cheesy! I had cheese overload on my first bite and was headed for \"gag city\", but I recovered with no dire consequences. The bruschetta appetizer was crispy and very tasty as was the calamari. I ordered the Shirmp Alfredo and it too was very good. 6 or 7 juicy shrimp and the pasta was cooked perfectly with it's accompanying Alfredo sauce. The serving was a normal size, but as I ate and ate the pasta seemed as though it would never end as it was the case with a few others dining at the table, some taking leftovers home in a box. Overall a memorable dinner presented with classic Italian flare, great company, great food and great service! Entree pricing is very reasonable with much of it below the $15 mark. The restaurant is open air with all the surrounding casino noise flowing in, so if you are looking for a quiet atmosphere this probably isn't for you. Waiters are wearing casual Levis, with a black apron, white shirt and a tie. I'm not sure why they are wearing their street clothes pants, but I've never been to Italy so never mind."}
{"text":"Took no time to be seated because it was not crowded. I was helped promptly. The bread sticks with the dipping sauces were very good. I ordered their pizza and it was baked to perfection, crispy and large. This was the first time I have been to the restaurant and my experience was very good."}
{"text":"Went here after the movies and looking forward to the veal piccata but the whole menu is changed. A lot of dishes I like here are gone including all the veal except for osso buco. So I decided to get the spinach and cheese cannelloni  It was so overpowered with a strong spinach that I couldn't taste the pasta it was wrapped in or the cheese. Hardly any white sauce so I asked for a side of red sauce to see if that would help. It didn't still too strong. I gave it to my husband and he couldn't eat it. His chicken parm was too salty and sauce was so light it had no flavor. New owners and menu took over five days ago. Also salad is not included with dinner anymore and salads are $8 and $9. No small house salad.  Two stars was for atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was too tired to drive to find food and this seemed like a better option than the night before working the sunset station.   I order fried mozzarella cheese, spaghetti bolognese with minestrone soup:  needless to say I had half of everything. Portions are substantial. I hate wasting food.   Fried mozzarella: made fresh on site: yummy but I old age two knowing how many calories they are!!  Soup: fantastic but thicker than I'm used too. I think there was oil or butter when usually minestrone is light and fresh. Still tastes good.   Spaghetti: exactly what I was craving. Toooo much. Oddly whatever was in it made me burp the rest of the night. It tastes great but I didn't care for the after affect.   Next time I'm back for work: I might eat here is its a I'm falling over tired night but other than that I'm going out oh the hotel for food!!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place for years...wasn't worth the wait. The calamari that came out in a paper bag was just ok. My wife and friend had Caesar salad and I had the minestrone(which was obviously sitting on the rail cooling until the server decided to bring it to out table). The three entrees...shrimp risotto and Tuscan steak were mediocre while my wife's chicken Marsala was horrible and sent it back with an offer from our waitress to bring a dessert on the house.  Had to wait about 15 minutes for a margarita to be brought...then when the complimentary dessert was brought up the waitress said \"if the boss will allow it\".  Needless to say...we didn't have the dessert that was offered in place of a horrible entre.  We're staying at the Sunset Station for 10 days and most likely will not be back!!!"}
{"text":"The management staff and wait staff we dealt with tonite was horrible....so much so that the manager there had his best waiter we are assuming come and free our meal out...I will never give this place money again...or dine there for free.... 20 minutes just to get water and breadsticks....appetizer never came....salad had no dressing...main waiter came twice...ignored us once....manager never came by....was too busy chatting with the non working hostess....good luck staying in business with this staff...Friday the 16th at around 830 to 9...6 tables in the whole store with customers...very sad"}
{"text":"I went here recently with my parents for my Dad's birthday. He had been waiting to take me here since he really liked it. The ambiance they managed to create inside a bustling casino was impressive. The string lights and trees made it feel like we were eating in a courtyard somewhere, not in the middle of a gamblers paradise.   The wait staff was friendly and professional. They had complimentary unlimited bread sticks and sauce (alfredo and marinara). The bread sticks reminded me of Olive Garden, but it was nice they didn't charge extra for the alfredo like OG does.   The salad that came with my pasta was overdressed, I had to leave some leaves behind because they were encased in dressing. The linguine and clams I ordered had so much potential! The pasta was cooked well, but the sauce was so liquidy it was like soup. Also, I've never seen so many little itty bitty clams before in the pasta...thank you for the generosity? My parents noted that the sauce was too soupy, but I didn't want to complain since I knew my Dad liked the place.   It's a cute place to eat if you're looking for basic Italian food."}
{"text":"We ate here twice recently and have discovered that the casio has recently taken over operation of the restaurant, which is an improvement. It does have very reasonably priced specials which is satisfying for the price you pay. (i.e. $5 flat breat pizzas) I imagine that the lure is the food specials and the profit is made on the drinks. It has a nice atmosphere and a cool wine sampling machine in the bar area. On both our viists, we ate in the bar area which was packaed but our bartender/server Katie was on her game and didn't miss a beat."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to IL Vino numerous times and have taken friends and family to dine with us.  We start off with a glass of wine.  Our wait is never more then 5 to 10 mins on the weekends.  We always start off with the yummy Fried Mozzarella.   Every visit we try a different entree off the menu and have been very satisfied with our choices.  My favorite ones so far is the Chicken Aliante or Chicken Picatta.  Flavor is just right and you don't need to add salt as like other places.  My husband has had the Eggplant Parmesan and has said its the best one he has had in while.  The prices are very reasonable and not overpriced as other italian restaurants.  The service is always a A ++.   This is our place to go and it helps that we don't have to drive to far."}
{"text":"I think this place is comparable to Maggiano's for a fraction of the price, I think the baked Penne and it was wonderful, I will try something else next time but this place may become a regular stop once a week. The decor is very nice and such a bargin for the price the staff has been great both times one with my girfriend and the other we had a group of 6."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined at the bar at Pasta Cucina last Saturday night with two other couples.  We did not have a reservation, and chose to eat at the bar rather than wait the estimated 20 minutes for a table in the restaurant.   I give two stars rather than one as the bartender/food server was friendly and accommodating in providing the upgraded wine list from the steakhouse.    The food was sincerely awful.  The bruschetta, recommended by the bartender, had clearly been prepared hours earlier and placed in a cooler.  The bread was cold and soggy, tomatoes flavorless.  I ordered the pasta with chicken and artichokes, which came with a house salad.  The salad was served warm, wilted, overdressed, and nearly inedible.  The pasta was overcooked, the sauce bland, barely any capers.  The chicken was dry, even while coated in the bland sauce.  I was nauseous the remainder of the evening after eating 1/4 of the dish."}
{"text":"good price, good ambiance, decent food.   Service was. bad. I look old and I'm old. she insisted on seeing my drivers license.  Really!  Rose(my waitress) get some common sense. all throughout the dinner  Rose adressed me as a sweetie. Towards end of evening I got sick of called sweetie.   Well if management train their wait staff better i will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant  We first went here a couple of months ago for dinner.  I wasn't expecting much because of the location, but I was wrong.  We have been back three times since then.  The food is delicious.  Chef Jeremy is Amazing!  We have loved every dish we have tried.  My favorites are the Shrimp Scampi, Chicken Parmesan, Insalata Italiana, Pepperoni Pizza and the Caprese Salad.  I usually never get desert after dinner, but the Tiramisu was amazing.  The staff is very friendly, and there is usually no wait.  If you love great Italian food, you must try this place, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"The bartender Heather is absolutely amazing. We went two nights in a row. Food was great !!!! Recommend the Alfredo sauce,shrimp Parmesan and to  it off with a drink by Heather !!!! The exotic was sweet and yummy !!!!! A hidden gem !!!!"}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend here the other day and I have to say I like the place well enough.   I see many semi bad reviews below, but as they tend to say you do get what you pay for. Do not expect a three star experience when you are short on budget. ;p  For what it is, I feel I got a good service and good food. Sure not superstar dishes but good dishes. I had the Seafood Linguini, which was good. I have to say I do like the one at the Italian restaurant at the golden nugget the best so far in town. My girl had Veal Piccata and it tasted good as well, she also had some wine, we received some breadsticks (Very similar to olive garden and I know, I used to work there heating them up ;p ) we also had an appetizer of some bruschetta with sundried tomatoes, mozzarella and balsamic glaze... this was REALLY good. Fresh and taste bud popping.  The server was always on top of things and was very nice and personable.  Oh, I almost forgot... there Cheesecake is the bomb. It's a ricotta based cheese cake so it's nice, thick and rich with that nice toasted outside. Yums  I am giving it 4 stars because it is what it portrays itself to be, a good atmosphere with good food, good service and good pricing.   I am sure I'll go back sometime."}
{"text":"For cheap Italian food in a casino in a pretty nice-looking setting, this place probably can be beat in LV.  Most dishes are under $10, house wine is $4, so not only is it a bargain, but the ambiance is nice, and the food is good.  The only downside is you have to walk through the Palace Station Casino to get there, so that takes it from a 4 to a 3 star rating."}
{"text":"This place deserves NO stars! I used to eat here atleast once a week, because I work for a flight crew that stays at sunset station. They are only open for a limited time and our flight leaves In the evenings at 12 midnight. So I used to put in a phone order and just eat it in my room for dinner and take a nap before my flight. They really never had the best customer service but the food is cheap and it's something to eat without having to go out of the hotel. I always get the spaghetti bolognese with house salad and breadsticks. Until my experience saturday night March, 7 2015! I waited on hold for over 25 minutes I understand they are busy but I'm a paying customer! So continuously waiting I thought they forgot about me on the phone, so I ended up calling back twice and no answer. So I got ahold of the hotel operator and she was so nice to try every extension to get ahold of them. Finally after an hour I get ahold of them, to put in my order. They say ok it will be ready in 15 minutes. So I head downstairs, go to the bar to pay for my food. So while I'm signing my bill, a waiter named Russell said for me to move to the other end of the bar because I'm in the way. Note, that I come here once a week and the hostess always tells me to go to that side of the bar. So already irritated I wait over 25 minutes for my food, a manager named Doug asks if I'm ok and by then I'm FUMING. So I tell him what has happened and apologizes and goes to grab my food. He doesn't really care just says sorry and he basically didn't want to give me anything. But whatever I'm not one to usually grumble but the service was horrible! And Doug calls himself a manager!? HA he's a joke. So I get back to my room to find out he forgot my breadsticks!!! So at this point I've had it already! I call and he tells me \"oh, breadsticks are upon request only\" are you kidding me!? I come here once a week for the past 4 months and you tell me it's upon requests!? So again doesn't apologize or anything Doug the manager just says that's their policy and he isn't going to do anything for me. So after that night, and after 2 hours of finally getting settled with my food I was so over it. The WOrST customer service. I will never go there again, and I'll be sure to tell everyone how horrible this place is."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place...it is a hidden gem like everyone says.  We've walked by this place all the time and finally decided to try it one evening and use our monthly station coupon.  It always looked so pretty from outside and felt even more so sitting inside.  The service is top notch, food is spectacular and quantity was perfect for the amount charged.  We actually went twice in one week, I love their orange roughy francese and hubby always gets their chicken parm with alfredo sauce. Try it - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"For a fast and inexpensive meal at the Sunset Station, Pasta Cucina is the place to go.  This cute little restaurant boasts their complete meals.  Pasta dishes comes with a soup or salad and unlimited bread sticks with marinara AND alfredo dipping sauces.  Also, the prices are right with dishes ranging from about $9-20.  The only thing I ever order has been the pasta bolognese ($10.99) and it was bomb.  Rich and meaty sauce smothered over perfectly cooked spaghetti.  Yum!  The restaurant is in open view of the casino but you won't even notice all the people outside.  I love the quaint European feel with the ceiling painted to resemble the sky and fake lemon trees around the establishment.  Feels like you're dining al fresca but not because you're still in a smokey casino lol.  Reasonably priced, decent food, and friendly service.  Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"every time i've been here the food is pretty darn good.  the service, on the other hand, can be down right terrible."}
{"text":"Wasn't the best food or service ever. Both meals were very bland.  The house salad looked like it was out of a bag. The Marsala was wet and lacked any depth. The baked penne was also very boring."}
{"text":"Its birthday time! My oldest brother set up dinner at Pasta Cucina for my mothers 73 birthday. I have to say the room is very nicely done. Lightly colored green leather half round booths. Dark rich wood ceiling cross beams. They have a fantastic center table that appeared to sit 8-10 people with a large round platter in the center of the table. They use drapery as a room break between the dining room and the kitchen. The room isn't elegant but is stylish and has the clean lines of a minimalist design.  The food is tasty and plentiful. I had the fruiti de mare. The pasta was as al dente like I prefer but it was soft/mushy pasta it was cooked perfect for the general public. There was an abundance of seafood but not over whelming. The sauce was tasty not to spicy nor was it bland. The portion is huge I brought home a little less than half the meal.   Everyone else at my table had chicken and artichokes. Everyone seemed happy with their choice and same as me they had plenty to take home. So, tasty good at good prices makes this place a hit.  We were given the birthday cannoli which I didn't taste but shared a tiramsu with my sister in-law. Ok here is were they lost me the desert has more moisture than this tiramsu. The word dry cant begin to explain this desert however all and all nice service, good food, great prices."}
{"text":"The service is good, the food is not bad. The last time I came here I had the chicken/artichoke dish which was great, this time I had the lasagna bolognese, way too much fennel - it was like having lemon seeds throughout the lasagna, they were \"popping\" as I chewed. My salad was also more white than green. When I think of a salad, I think of a green salad. (Personal choice of liking leafy greens, not the iceberg stems only). Others' salads looked better than mine though so maybe it was flukey. Algis - the best waiter - thanks!"}
{"text":"Bad bad experience! We asked the waitress please we are a little bit late for our movie and she responded shell try , well Nop at all and we understand it's not on her hands , after all we ask for some lemons and guess what ? Never came   Had to ask the Busser who took 10 min tho.  After all we asked for the check and the first thing she said is \" next time you better come with enough time for dinner, I answered yes I know it's our fault, so , she said \" oh you don't like to listen ? Do you ? \" .... Excuse ?? So bad they have terrible service here. Food is great ! The runner talking to the Hostes , the Busser just came to us saying the waitress was busy to come to the table..... One after another , I left the check with a complain to the Hostes hopping she deliver to the manager personally. Sorry , bad and awful experience. Never comeback!! Weird for stations casinos restaurant"}
{"text":"I really don't like giving lower star ratings, but wow...sometimes it just can't be helped.  Pasta Cucina here at the Texas Station was in a word, underwhelming.  After being seated I just wasn't even close to impressed.  I should have known something was up because on a Friday night the place was near empty, with maybe only 4-5 tables being occupied at the time.  Spider-Sense failed me!  The place was set nicely with great ambience and warmth.  But none of this was used to the restaurant's advantage.  After being seated by the friendly manager we proceeded to wait...and wait.  My lady and I did hear some light arguing in the back of the house involving why the couple that just came in (us) was seated at our particular table.  Seems our waiter was hoping it would stay empty until closing so he could promptly leave right when the restaurant closed.  I being a good sport disregarded hearing this to try and give him a chance.  I know the feeling of wanting to go home after a long day at work.  We waited for nearly 20 minutes before our waiter came out to greet us, with me pretending we didn't hear him talking about us prior.  He gave us a wine list (which was average at best) but we passed on it and asked for an ice water and iced tea.  Again, we waited.  About 15 minutes later we received our drinks and the menus.  Strike one!  The real reason we decided to try here was because Station Casinos was touting Pasta Cucina's 2 for $20 menu, with 11 entrees to choose from.  I would have never gone to this place otherwise to give it a shot.  So call me surprised when we receive our menus there is no 2 for $20 option to be found.   I inquire about this and I get a look from the waiter as if I'm a cheapskate.  I am, but there's no need to be rude to me!  Our waiter takes the regular menus from us and replaces them with a smaller one that has the 2 for $20 entree specials on it.  Funny thing is that because the entrees were on the cheaper side we wanted to order something from the appetizer section of the regular menu to treat ourselves.  Our waiter didn't even bother asking if we still wanted to see the regular menu.  The smart thing to do would have been to bring out BOTH the regular and 2 for $20 menu and let us choose.  This guy thought we were foolish and wouldn't even know they were running specials.  Hello!  There is a big billboard plastered right outside the casino's property!  Strike two!  The last straw for me was the food itself...so bland and boring!  No inspiration with the cooking.  I could have cooked this same exact food myself at home!  No joke!  Our 2 for $20 menu entrees came with soup or salad and breadsticks as a starter.  The breadsticks were a bit of a joke, warm but very reminiscent of those from that 'Olive' place.  Same shape too!  Forgettable for sure.  Pasta Cucina's house salad though was horrendous.  The other unnamed 'Italian' place had a much better salad!  Veggies were on the limp side and the dressing was watered down with not much pop.  Sad.  Our entrees didn't fare much better.  I had the porcetta pizza with mushrooms and artichoke hearts.  The crust was cracker thin which was nice and crispy, but the toppings were scarce and overdone from sitting under the oven or the heat lamp too long.  Seriously, the small sprinking of toppings didn't give me much to go on, and the sauce and cheese were lacking in flavor and quantity.  A real let down.  My lady's chicken parmesan fared a little better but barely.  The portion of food was much more acceptable, with two large chicken breasts, and a good serving of spaghetti and marinara.  The spaghetti was okay but could have used more sauce and some salt and fresh herbs.  The chicken parmesan itself was unimpressive since it really tasted like it came frozen instead of made fresh.  The breading was soggy in some parts and actually nearly blackened in a couple spots along the edges from overcooking.  I couldn't get past this because really, who likes burnt breading?  Covering it with sauce and some cheese doesn't make the burnt taste go away.  I flipped the chicken over to check and sure enough, over dark edges.  This was strike three for me!  We were out of there ASAP.  Our waiter didn't bother keeping our drinks refilled, I had to ask him after they were sitting empty to fill them back up.  We had quite a bit of leftovers from both entrees and asked for some to go boxes.  Our waiter proceeded to take our food to the back and pack them up.  At this point I was totally turned off from Pasta Cucina and just wanted to get out of there.  I paid and even though I had some lackluster service from our waiter, I left him a 20% tip anyway.  I take our leftover box and drive home.  An hour later I'm hungry again.  I open up the box and guess what?!  Our lovely waiter only packed up my leftover bland A$$ pizza!  No leftover chicken parmesan!  Pasta Cucina is a B-U-M-M-E-R.  Avoid!"}
{"text":"If I could, I would give this restaurant no points at all. It was probably one of the worst experiences I have had since a long time. I had been craving Italian for a while and thought since this is so close to us we should give it a try.   As we entered the restaurant there was nobody there to seat us. We waited there somehow confused wondering if we have to seat ourselves maybe! Then after a couple of minutes, a girl came towards us and told us that it would take 5 to 10 minutes, where clearly in a restaurant with a capacity of close to 350 seats, there were at least 200 seats still available. So I didn't understand why we had to wait 10 minutes while she and another girl were just standing there and talking.   Then after 5 minutes she finally brought the menus and seated us. Ok, the ambient is very nice and it gives you a little bit of a high class feeling. But unfortunately nothing else in the restaurant is high class. We ordered a glass of red wine (Chianti) for $11 and a pomegranate soda for $2.99.   We ordered the bread sticks that came with a marinara sauce and a Alfredo sauce. The marinara sauce tasted like the one from the food court and the Alfredo sauce tasted really dry and bland. The bread sticks were dry and not so fresh. I have had better ones at Olive Garden. At this point I was so hungry though that I didn't care so much.   Then I ordered the eggplant Parmesan with spaghetti. Well, the spaghetti didn't come until I asked where they are. He admitted that they had brought me the wrong order and that he would bring me a side spaghetti. But he never apologized for it and only tried to justify it by saying that it happens and the cook is busy. He did bring the side spaghetti with marinara sauce. Then I had like 4 bites of my food and couldn't take another bit. The whole thing tasted worse than a food court Italian place. Marinara tasted like out of a jar and the side spinach was just bland and nothing special.   I was very disappointed in my food and we let the waiter know. Half a minute later, he is standing there with the manager and another waiter and they are discussing this about 10 feet from us, then whispering and looking over!   Then he came back and apologized and asked me if I wanted anything else but gave us this look, that made us very uncomfortable. To top everything the waiter lost our credit card at the end and we had to wait 15 minutes watching them looking for the credit card.   We definitely wouldn't go back there as the quality price ratio wasn't fair at all. This was just a terrible experience and the manager didn't even try to make up for it."}
{"text":"Not bad for the prices- we happen to be in the neighborhood and the mister was crazing \"olive garden\" so we decided to try this instead.  They have a spaghetti and meatballs special for $6.99 that includes a salad and bread so I decided to get that.  The mister got the chicken piccatta and we ordered dipping sauces ( marinara/alfredo) for the bread.  I also ordered the minestrone soup and Caesar salad.  The caesar salad was good- they were a little heavy handed with the dressing but at least it did not taste like the caesar in a bottle- tasted almost homemade with a slight anchovy flavor. Minestrone soup was also okay- had plenty of vegetables, beans and was not too salty. My spaghetti and meatballs was, well, spaghetti and meatballs- something I could've made at home.  The meatballs were nice and moist but had an odd flavor to me, tasted like they seasoned it with alcohol or something but it was fine after a few bites. The mister's chicken piccatta was actually pretty good, plenty of mushrooms and capers.  Just the right amount of lemon too.  Overall, I would say it was a success. Not sure if I would make a special trip back but if we happen to be in the casino and craving italian, we might venture in again..."}
{"text":"we went  2011.05.14.2000. veal scaloppini and chicken marsala were excellent. Sunny, our server, was great. mojito was the best we've had. only criticism is bruschetta should be on italian bread not melba toast."}
{"text":"First timers and they didn't let us down. Great price, friendly staff, awesome food!!!"}
{"text":"Howie wanted Italian for his birthday dinner.  The ambiance is New Age, the staff friendly.  Howard's dinner came with a beautiful salad.  I ordered the soup.  I am not a minestrone fan unless it is made from scratch.  This was obviously made from scratch, however the soup base tasted like watery tomato juice.    Not a fan.  Howie ordered the chicken and artichoke.  Uneatable.  He said the sauce tasted like starchy pasta water.  He didn't eat it but of course he didn't send it back.  I had the Tuscan Steak with caramelized onions and blue cheese.  It came with parmesan roasted potatoes.  It was amazing.  Really made-up for Howard's terrible meal.  The waiter served him a cannoli with happy birthday. Very nice.  Will we eat there again...maybe.  will Howard order the chicken and artichoke pasta again I don't think so."}
{"text":"Aliante sent us a coupon for this place, so we used it. The atmosphere was excellent - I loved the dim lighting, spaced-out tables, and classy decor. The food nothing special unless you consider how cheap it is - for what you pay, the food's pretty darn good! Our waiter was rather hurried; either there were people out sick or they need to hire more staff. Nothing was wrong with his service though.   Overall if you live nearby and are looking for a cheap yet romantic date, I'd recommend this place."}
{"text":"closer to 2.5 stars, but i'll round up with a coupon. Without a coupon, round down.   Not too bad with a 2 for 1 offer.    Had the spaghetti bolognese.. not bad!  Not quite as good as Macoroni grill, but it came close.    The free bread was edible.  3 different types, although somewhat mediocre in quality, it wasn't that bad.  The butter was bland, and flavorless.  For dessert, I had the creme brulee.   Pretty average.. About buffet quality, but a bigger portion.   Overall, not as bad as I expected, but nothing that blew me away either."}
{"text":"Surprising to find a good and reasonably priced Italian restaurant in a busy casino. Their Cheese Ravioli was the best I've had."}
{"text":"This is classic Italian fare, prepared wth care.  Portions are generous; prices are reasonable and the service was superb.  Pizzas looks appealing; our chicken entrees were delicious.  The Caesar salad was served with a chilled fork; the minestrone soup was teeming with vegetables.  The tiramisu practically melted in your mouth.  Staff seemed well-trained, knowledgable and attentive, but not overly so.  This was a memorable dining experience in  location where I was expecting mediocrity.  What a wonderful surprise!"}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced Italian food with a nice environment (Even nicer than The Broiler Steakhouse located also at Palace Station).  We like the thin crust pizzas and a mix of all different flavors of italian sodas - actually carbonated water with one of 20 different flavors added to it.. watermelon is the best. The best pizza is the artichoke and spinach pizza, make sure to have them grate fresh parmeson on your pizzas."}
{"text":"Great value!  Loved the food.  Heads and Shoulders above the Broiler in the same hotel.  Will definitely make a point of eating there when we are in Vegas next."}
{"text":"I actually really really liked this place!  =)  We were catching a movie in the casino and walking around trying to decide on a place to grab something.  We went in and sat down, our waitress was very nice and actually very knowledgeable about the wines and had some great suggestions.  The food was VERY good and was very cheap IMO.  It came fast when we told her we were in a hurry and overall I really just had a very positive experience."}
{"text":"Great value.  Always get an appetizer.  Their calamari and meatball sliders are excellent and under 6 dollars.  So far I've had the lasagna, and the frutti demar. Both of which are under 10 dollars and nice portions, they also come with soup or salad both of which taste food.  Martinis are 6 dollars a piece and are nice sized.  Dessert is a little small so we usually skip it.  Sure beats the Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Love this place, Nice quiet romantic atmosphere, Trees all around make for a serene peaceful and Beautiful dining experience. Gives you an Outdoors feel, while dining inside. Excellent staff, Host and Staff are friendly engaging and very accommodating. The portions have gotten smaller. Veal parmIgiana, my favorite is excellent. Chicken Parmigiana & eggplant parmigiana also good and favorites. Seafood dishes also good. Don't care for their crispy over fried calamari, everything else from Soups, Salads to dessert\"s  All good. Conveniently located inside The SUNSET CASINO, which has a GREAT RACE BOOK ! Post time, Riders Up ! Horses are in the starting Gate $$$"}
{"text":"This is the third time my family has been to this resturant. We live in California so we make it a point to come to the Palace Staion to eat there. The food is awesome! and the house salad omg so tastee. And the prices are so unbeliveble cheap for what you get. And the sevice FANTASTIC!!!!! our waiter was awesome, and the hostess was also polite I just wish they had a Pasta Cucina in my town!!!"}
{"text":"If I could say \"meh\" to Italian food I would say it a thousand times over about the food at Pasta Cucina. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.  My mother received a coupon for Pasta Cucina in the mail and we figured it was a good enough deal to get us in. I'm weary of Italian places because I just feel like a lot of them are overpriced and not very good. Hmm, my inklings continue to prove me right.   Let's begin with service - lackluster and cold. The BIOTCH waitress who served us was just terrible. And yes, she was indeed a BIOTCH in all rights. She knew we had a coupon and we didn't order her much pushed on us wine. Therefore we were done, for her, by the time we ordered our raspberry iced teas. Everything else about her service to use was electronic and rude.  Food - the raspberry iced tea was incredibly too sweet. I felt like I was drinking tea spiked with Hi-C fruit punch. Terrible for a \"nice\" restaurant to serve such a drink. I ordered the Tuscan Angel Hair Pasta with Chicken (add $2). The plate was being overtaken with angel hair, and all the other ingredients were lost. The dish boasted pine nuts - I think I got a total of five in the whole dish. Instead of lovely combo of flavors, which the dish should have been, it was just a mound of angel hair with some chicken pieces thrown on it. My mother ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, a dish that is wonderfully traditional, and which she loves. The meatballs were large and they were good. The sauce was decent, but alas - my mother asked to have the normal spaghetti replaced with angel hair and guess what? She got regular spaghetti.  By this point we were stuffed and had only eaten not even half of our dishes (they're just HUGE). We got to-go bags and received our bill. If I had been paying the waitress would have gotten half the tip my mother left her.   I will not return to Pasta Cucina. Overpriced Italian food restaurant strikes again."}
{"text":"Pasta Cucina is the replacement for our beloved San Lorenzo, the Italian offering at Texas Station. Apparently, the expression \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\" must be Greek to the powers that be - not English. Not even Italian.   Strike One:  We tried to come here a couple of weeks ago, but at 9:05 pm we were five minutes too late. In Vegas, baby??  And, Holy Heart Failure, Batman! - the $10 coupon we had was going to expire in a couple of days. \"No problem\", said the manager. \" Whenever you come back, we'll take it.\" Ha!!  Tonight's manager finally agreed to accept it, but only after grilling us so thoroughly about that other manager, whose name we never got, that he made us feel like cheats and liars.  Strike Two:  Gone is the beautiful Tuscan ambience, with its rustic walls and elegant decor.  The booths, tables, and layout are the same, but it's now more generic English Clubroom, more dark wood.  Not bad, but not as pretty.  What IS bad is that the comfortable chairs were replaced with smaller, open-back back-killers.  One of these chairs housed an enormously obese woman two tables away, and the chair looked like it wasn't going to make it.  The old leather chairs could've held two of her.  Strike Three:  Our server, Autumn, was by far the pushiest waitperson we have EVER encountered, from here to Reykjavik, and far beyond.  From the moment we sat down, she hammered away at us, trying five times - before, during, and after the meal - to get us to refill our wine.  As we finished our entrees, she asked if we'd like  a nice glass of Sauvignon Blanc.  When it wasn't the wine, she was pushing the cocktails.  When we declined appetizers, she soldiered on, enumerating every appetizer on the menu, with a description of each.  They were all there on the menu - did we look illiterate? But wait.  There's more!  Desserts, each one described in painstaking detail, then the coffees.  I was hoping that the review I was drafting - with the characteristic Yelp Red emanating with such precise resolution from my iPhone - would be a warning to her.  But nooooo.  And as we walked out, I saw what one of their coffee cups looked like - the size of a Starbucks espresso (I know it wasn't espresso, 'cause I asked the woman who'd ordered it), and I sure was glad I passed on it - for two reasons, the second being that it probably infuriated Autumn even more  :)  All through the meal she kept checking on us, but it didn't come off as genuine concern.  It was always with a smarmy undertone that clearly conveyed her thinly-veiled displeasure with our small appetites.    By now you must be wondering about the food.  After all, isn't that what it's all about?  Admittedly, I can only judge the food comparatively.  San Lorenzo was Italian (the food, not the Saint), and so is this place.  The menu is virtually the same as before, at least the entrees, since we never order appetizers unless we're with others.  And the entrees were mostly decent.  But:  my husband ordered a dinner salad, and it was mostly iceberg lettuce.  The fabulous bread that we always ate too much of is gone, replaced by white bread soft breadsticks that, though served warm, were reminiscent of Pillsbury.  The entree portions are smaller.  Before, the entree covered the plate, and the linguine was served in a separate bowl.  Now there's less of each, on one plate.  I had Chicken Caprese, which was sauteed and topped with a chopped roasted red pepper sauce, artichoke hearts, and mozzarella.  I had to dig hard to find the cheese; the roasted pepper topping was flavorful, but the chicken under it sat in a pool of water and was totally devoid of taste. To my palate, it could have been tofu. Hubby had the Chicken Piccata.  Same chicken, different sauce, which he liked.  Lemon and capers can't be all bad.  Would the food have been better if someone else had waited on us?  Maybe.  But dinner in a restaurant isn't just about the food, it's the whole experience.  And this experience left a somewhat bitter aftertaste."}
{"text":"i talked my grandparents into skipping the buffet for just one night and we were all so grateful that i did.  they can be difficult to please in that they will almost exclusively eat soft comfort foods but capri had something for each of us.  my grandfather raved about the shrimp scampi - a dish he had never in his life tried despite his love of shrimp - and my grandmother said the alfredo (with chicken) was the best she'd ever had (she opted for angel hair in lieu of the usual fettuccinni since she dines dentureless).  i decided to forego my taste for tomato and opted for the chicken and artichoke in a wine butter sauce (and requested it over a bed of penne) and was wholly impressed.  the basket of various breads was warm and generously filled and my glass o' iced tea was never empty.  we will be back during my next visit, guaranteed."}
{"text":"We went here because we had a coupon.  Upon arrival we were told there would be a 30 minute wait for a table.  They took my cell number to call me when the table was ready.  They did call within the time and seated us.  We waited for 5 minutes before we were acknowledged after seated.    Finally the server came and offered us a drink.  We ordered our drink and the insulate italiano.  He brought us our drinks and asked if we wanted appetizers.  We stated we ordered one already which he then remembered.  We gotordered the saladfood which wasis actually veryunder good.  When we finally got the chance to order dinner, my wife ordered the grilled chicken caprese and I ordered the rigatoni with sausage.  Her chicken was over cooked, dry and the sauce very bland.  My plate, the pasta was good, the sausage which is not made in house was not too bad.  The meatballs were actually under cooked and raw in the very center.  The sauce was ok, not spectacular, I make a better sauce at home.  The server was ok, not the best we ever had but not the worst.  This is not a place we will go back too.  There are much better itilian places to eat which are comparable in price and the food is made in house and cooked properly. Again, the server tried his best and when we let him know about the food he did take her order off the bill and was very understanding.  He definitely had a desire to see the place he works do better."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying if you're staying in the Sunset stations hotel you gotta eat here. The breadsticks were perfection and the marinara sauce was the best I've ever had! You wouldn't expect that from a restaurant in a casino but it was amazing! I got the special which was the surf and turf. The steak was under seasoned but our great server made me a \"special sauce\" and it was delicious. I also liked the way the restaurant was decorated."}
{"text":"Pasta Cucina has always been 5 stars but I can't give it to it right now.. First let me say that the service is impeccable as always, their waiters & waitresses are most attentive & always so nice!! Second the food is delicious as always. Great interpretations of Italian classics cooked to order with fresh ingredients. Why 4 stars you ask? Because corporate greed has put their finger in the pie. Really everything is a la carte now!! Come on Station Casinos your brand is about great value for locals!! I liked my salad that came with my entree whenever I ate at Pasta Cucina. If I want a la carte I'll go to the Strip but I don't expect it at my local casino. Do that at the Palms not your local places. Bring back your entree with salad. Remember your local clientele is what helped get you in the big leagues!!"}
{"text":"This place has decent food. Got the baked ziti. Was good. Had a perfect balance of sauce and meats. Also got the Fettuccini Alfredo with chicken. 4 stars for that. The bread is like Olive Garden bread but not as soft or moist. The Cesar salad looked terrible. Didn't eat it.   The Mozarella appetizer was amazing. Def recommend that dish.   The dinner took WAY TOO LONG to come out after the salad. At least 20 min. We were full by the time the dinner came out.   But what really grossed us out and was MAJORLY DISGUSTING was our server coughed in her hands right next to our table right before serving our salad. She coughed for like 10 seconds and didn't wash her hands right after but served our salad right away. Our table was like \"we are not touching that!\" Like how do you do that so openly and expect nobody to see or react to that? The experience really turned out whole stomach.   But we still ate the pastas since a good runner brought it not our server. I didn't want to complain because I am not one to try and get free stuff and free load. I don't want to mention her name because I know she didn't do it on purpose or intentionally. And it is Christmas. So I'm not trying to put anyone on blast. But it's still gross.   Plus she didn't seem like she wanted to be here tonight anyway. I don't blame her. We still left a 20% tip."}
{"text":"As soon as I can in everyone was so wonderful. My server terezia was amazing love her she made me feel so comfortable with everything. Over all the food was wonderful. Thanks to Claudia she even went out of the way to get me bread from the steak house. I love this place."}
{"text":"The Station Hotel Casino is the half way stop from Reno NV to Tubac AZ.  this is the third time I've eaten at this restaurant within the hotel.  It's always been pretty good.  Today, however, we were given that you have no reservations look in an empty restaurant. That look really ticks me off. Then we were seating in \"no mans land.\"  When waitress came she started to tell us she didn't know this was her table then she apologized and took our order. She was then very polite and pleasant. However it took a full 65 minutes before we received our entree, unfortunately no apology for the delayed food  Going back a few steps we asked if the clams were fresh or canned. She said a combo of both. Bummer, last year they were all fresh. So we ordered shrimp scampi that needed more garlic. And the llobster and shrimp ravioli had so much sauce you really couldn't tell what it was. Too bad. Will think twice about coming again. The hotel has many options"}
{"text":"If I could eat one food everyday for the rest of my life, it would be eggplant parmesan. In my mind eggplant parmesan is a tasty food that is hardly possible to ruin. I am attracted to eggplant parmesan as a duck is to water. With that said I have good things to write about Pasta Cucina.    This is actually my second dining experience in a Pasta Cucina. It is an accidental dining experience. I was in Boulder Station bound for Feast Buffet. So were hundreds of other people. I passed over an expected blah meal in the Grand Cafe. I tried Pasta Cucina. I was very satisfied. Fast forward to a couple of weeks later and I was dining in the Sunset Station Pasta Cucina.    What is surprising is that Pasta Cucina's prices are relatively the same as the Grand Cafe. An example is that spaghetti and meatballs is $7.99 at Grand Cafe. At Pasta Cucina's it was $9.99 and INCLUDED bread sticks with dipping sauces plus a salad or Minnestroni soup. Where Grand Cafe has a decent atmosphere, Pasta Cucina borders on the elegant with the Sunset Station Medditeranian motif. You could say Pasta Cucina is a borderline classy restaurant with Grand Cafe pricing.    When I stepped into Pasta Cucina, which is to the right of Feast Buffet; I observed that the dress code was casual and the noise level average. Throughout the meal, the Waiter was professional and attentive.    A few minutes after ordering, the Waiter placed the warm soft bread sticks on the table. They were served with both mozzarella and ranch sauces. I enjoyed every bite being careful to save my appetite.    The salad with ranch dressing was a taste of the food to arrive. Meanwhile the Waiter was on top of the Pepsi refills. If I was up to an alcohol beverage, the menu features a decent selection of cocktails for $6.     The serving of the three slabs of eggplant parmesan over spaghetti was moderate yet delicious. Although the eggplant parmesan is levels below Chef Mark and Chef Olds, it was slightly better than I remember Olive Garden and Long Island (NY) diners. I had zero issues with the eggplant parmesan and spaghetti. They could of added an additional slab of eggplant parmesan, but I would have little appetite for the cannolis.      After savoring every bite of eggplant parmesan with spaghetti,  I treated my tastebuds to desert. It was two cannolis with a cup of coffee. The delicious taste of the cannolis complimented the quality coffee.    If you are in the vicinity of Sunset Station and enjoy Italian food at Grand Cafe prices, I recommend Pasta Cucina. You live once, why not enjoy delicious Italian food at a price that won't drain your wallet."}
{"text":"We've been here probably 7 or 8 times in the last year or so.  We love the ambiance inside with the lemon trees and lights.  The food is prettty good but the value is the best.  Service is always great.  A couple can eat an appetizer, 2 mea+ls, salads and 2 rounds of cocktails for around $50-$60.  Thats a great deal in my opinion.  They have wonderful breadsticks and they are served with marinara and alfredo sauce.  If your lookling for a nice meal and a reasonable price, you can not go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"My lowly expectations for this meal were realized.  The restaurant was not busy, but everything from start to finish seemed to take a little too long.  We were served warm garlic bread with balsamic vinegar and olive oil, but the bread was too salty.  The lobster ravioli in a tomato cream sauce ordered by Ann was a bit too al dente while my eggplant Parmesan entrée was heavily breaded thick slices of undercooked eggplant.  The only savings grace was I used a $10 off coupon from the Las Vegas Advisor.    A rating of 1.5 would be most accurate."}
{"text":"We went here last night with some friends and our whole dining experience was superb!   I looked on Yelp beforehand and got the feeling this place was a hit or miss. Luckily it was a total HIT for us!   You have to try it for yourself, forget the bad comments!  We shared a Cesar salad before our meal and that was a perfect size for both of us. If we had each ordered a dinner salad instead of sharing, we would have been way too full to eat our dinners. Keep in mind they also give you bread sticks, Olive Garden-type, along with olive oil and vinegar before your meal.   I ordered the Seafood Linguine and my husband ordered the Meat Rigatoni. We were both very pleased with the taste, price and size of our meals! Very Generous portions of pasta, enough to take home and eat the other half later, or share 1 entree for 2 people.   My entree was very tasty and had plenty of seafood! My husband loves meat, usually there isn't enough in any entree. He commented that there was too much for him to eat.   The service was awesome, the food was delicious and the ambiance was perfect! I would highly recommend, and we will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is nice, but the food was just meh.  Calamari: I usually try to get my date to tell me a good long story once the calamari arrives so that I can eat it ALL while he's talking.  Not so here.  We each ate a few bites and left the rest.  I NEVER leave calamari on the table!  It was just not good.  Main dishes: Nice portions!  But nothing spectacular when it comes to taste.  I had the chicken cannelloni and it was a bit dry.  Wine: Decent selection.  The prices are great if you're on a budget, and the ambiance is nice if you're trying to make it a date night.  But if you're looking for basic American-friendly Italian, Olive Garden will give you the same menu with a better taste."}
{"text":"The food here is just mediocre. It's not too expensive, but the expression \"you get what you pay for\" definitely applies here. The dishes tend to be a bit on the bland side. The Italian soda was also unexceptional. It's tough to find good Italian in NLV, and this place is definitely not it."}
{"text":"We took advantage of a weluvlocals coupon and I was really looking forward to this but turned out to be somewhat of a so-so event.  The wait was 15 minutes longer than we were told which was unusual since they had empty tables.  When we sat I was pretty hungry enticed by the rolling menu reader board outside the restaurant.  Looking around at some still empty tables we decided to start out with an appetizer and chose the Caprese Croutons.  Side note: Our server was friendly but border line annoying.  The rest of the folks we encountered were nice and friendly, helpful.  But our server, was somewhat patronizing.  \"Oh well, glad she is not siting down to eat with us\" I thought.    We ordered Seafood Linguini, the Grilled Chicken and Broccoli, and the Chicken Cannelloni.  While we waited we feasted on some pretty good breadsticks and the crouton appetizers.  My hopes somewhat dimminshed by the wait and the server began to rise again.  There were still a number of empty tables and we wondered why do they keep everyone waiting?  Aside from the wait to get in, our food arrived fairly promptly, nice and hot.  Looking apetizing we began to sample.  My cannelloni was a mass of cheese, more than I thought since the menu said topped by a garlic cream sauce.  It tasted good but I expected quite a bit more spinach on the inside.  What I found was, well, more cheese and a few flecks of spinach.    While we continued I looked at Mikes plate and said \"did they forget the sauce?\" and he said \"there is some here, somewhere.\"  Clearly not enough for us sauce lovers though.  The linguini was the same story.  Lot's of noodles, a little bit of sauce, and a sprinkling of seafood.  There were two sugar cube sized pieces of salmon, three rings of calamari, a few mussels and clams and three medium-small shrimp.  Not a seafood lovers plate but it tasted OK, just not enough sauce, again.  When we were finishing up we asked to see a desert menu.  Our server said \"I'll be with you in a moment\".  We waited fifteen minutes to get the menu, in the meantime our leftovers were boxed by some helpful drink servers and we were ready to go.  We saw our server busying about a few times but never looked our way.  Finally we flagged her down and she said \"ready for your check?\"  We decided to skip desert.  Overall the food was fair.  I almost gave this place a two star but with the coupon, the overall friendly service, ample breadsticks I decided to cut some slack.  I wanted so much to fall in love with this place but I think there are better Italian places to eat.  Oh, and there were empty tables the entire time we were there, while people stood and waited to be seated."}
{"text":"Never ate here before so dont have previous to compare to .. It was 'ok'. Service was good. Had reserves but didnt need them - Seated promptly on arrival -  only 3 other tables occupied. Server took cocktail order .. was surprised no one brought us water.  Then when server brought cocktails had water too. Breadsticks and 2 sauces - marinara and alfredo to dip. Breadsticks were warm - had salt/garlic pieces that stuck to fingers that would not wipe off easiy on napkin - required finger licking.   Appetizer was their Antipasti Plate - Bruschetta, Zucchini Fritti, and Mozzarella Frita.  Would not order again. Husband had Lasagna - he said it was good - \"Olive Garden\" type so nothing extraordinary. Based on a review I read, I ordered Lobster Canneloni - would not order again - very salty. Had decent flavor but only 2 discernable mini-pieces of lobster.  Offered coffee, desert  which we declined.  The wait staff doesnt seem to realize how loud they are when they are 'behind the curtain' to the kitchen.  We could hear everything.  Also there seemed to be more staff than needed - there was not much activity during the hour we were there and when we left there were still only 3 other tables occupied.  Received bill - jeez a vodka martini costs $11 each - they werent even Belvedere just house martini.    Would not go back.  Sorry"}
{"text":"The house soup and house salad were great. I didn't try the pasta which I think is good. Do NOT order \"Lobster&Shrimp Rivioli\" because it tastes like microwave food."}
{"text":"I hate having to do this, because the food was really good. But, the service was terrible. Just rotten.   We had a rather large party, I believe 7 or 8 in total. It was not a busy evening, this is what the waiter forgot: to bring my drink, to put my salad dressing on the side, to bring my partner's salad, to put my partner's salad dressing on the side when he flags them down to ask about said salad, my entree.   I could forgive all of the other little things, but not getting my actual dinner was awful. Here is how it went down:  Everyone's entrees come out. Smelling and looking good. I was hungry. Mine is missing. No big deal, waiter probably couldn't carry all them heavy pasta plates. I wait, wait, and wait. Five minutes go by, the waiter has not even noticed that I am the only one without food.   We have to flag him down. He forgot to put in my order. He goes to do that. Time goes on. Everyone is now asking for take away boxes, and I STILL don't have my food. We end up cancelling the order, because I don't want to sit there and eat while seven people watch me. And I don't want to bring home a soggy eggplant to microwave later.   The waiter did apologize, citing that it was his second day, which in my opinion is not an excuse. He asked me how he could make it better. As I was being treated to dinner by a family member, it would have been awkward of me to make any requests, so I just brushed him away. What he should have done was offered me another chance to make it up to my husband and I, by offering us a meal on the house at a later date.   When he gave us the bill, he kept telling us not to leave a tip. Again, this made it super awkward for my generous family member who was footing the bill. He had to keep up appearances as well, so left a tip anyways.   It's a shame, because my family had raved about this place on their last visit. We leave just around the corner, and most definitely will NOT be returning because of the poor service. There are better restaurants."}
{"text":"we stayed at boulder station and I felt like eating Italian so we decided to try this place.  i thought this place was one of those fast did place because it seemed like very restaurant here looked like it.  but this place you walk into the doors and then the restaurant is inside.  we had to wait around 30 minutes.  I really suggest you call and MAKE A RESERVATION.  you get in a lot faster.  I think we came about 1.5 hour before the place closed.  when we finally got to our table, there were a lot of free tables open but we still had to wait 30 minutes to get a table.. WTH weird and that kinda annoyed me.  they better have a good reason for making me wait!!   I loved the eggplant Parmesan at this other restaurant so I tried and ordered it here.  i didn't know that this was battered and it had spaghetti noodles on it too.  I did not like this dish at all.  there was too much batter that's all I tasted and the spaghetti sauce was whatever's.  I would have rather eaten it as an appetizer instead of being it's own entree with the noodles.  I forgot what entree I ordered but it was really good.  it was linguini and it had clams, mussels, and shrimp in it.  it was also in a red sauce that kind of resembled marinara but was more watery.  the sauce flavor was good!! ask for this dish if you go here.  I also liked the free breadstick dip. so good!!! the breadsticks were good too."}
{"text":"The $5 pizzas in the bar area are awesome awesome!  Thin crusted, great toppings, large for $5!  Plus the Chicken Parm sliders are only $3!!  You can eat here for under $10 for a couple.  We love this place!!!"}
{"text":"A friend of  mine told me this was the best Italian place she'd been to in a long time.  I thought she was being a bit dramatic and didn't really believe it.  She decided to go here for her 30th birthday which gave me a chance to decided for myself.    I was very suprised at the prices on this menu.  Very inexpensive!  I'm talking like, $7.99 for a very sizable portion of food.  I couldn't believe it.  The cocktail menu was the same story.  $6 for a cocktail.  I ordered one of these and it was a double.  Very nice!  The food was just as suprising.  I had the Eggplant Parmesan which was very delicious.  My wife had Fettucine and the noodles were a little al dente but the flavor was spot on.  Of all the eight people with us, no one complained about their food.  Everyone said it was very delicious.    I don't know if this is the best Italian for I've had in town but for price to quality it is definitely top notch and a must stop if you like Italian and are on a budget!"}
{"text":"I tried this place last night and since I am an Italian originally from New York, I figured my opinion might be useful.  After about a 30 minute wait, we were finally seated.  Our waiter was Chris, who sounded like he was from NY, but  I didn't ask him.  He brought us out some bread sticks, which were similar to the ones you find at Olive Garden.. decent, but not that you would expect at a real Italian restaurant..  I ordered the eggplant parm because I have been DYING for some good eggplant around here.. My husband order the chicken parm.  The eggplant was pretty good.. nothing amazing, the portion was pretty good. Had I not opted for their $4 side salad before my entree, I might have been slightly disappointed.    The eggplant was not the best I'd had, but it was edible, unlike some places I'd been to out here.  The sauce was OK.. nothing too great and seemed almost \"too smooth,\" not chunky at all and seemed to be too much of a bright red.  My husband seemed to like his chicken.  We may or may not go back here.. I haven't decided yet."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed by the food. I had Tuscan Angel Hair and it was very runny like some one forgot to drain the pasta.  What really turned us off was that the server tried to set the table for the next guest while we were still sitting there. The place was only 50% full. I just got the impression was that her attitude was \"your'e done, how LEAVE\""}
{"text":"Almost 3 years ago, I gave this place a very good rating.  Since then I've dined there probably two dozen times and for the most part, my 4-star review continued to sum-up my opinion.  But as-of now, my opinion of Pasta Cucina has changed -- unfortunately.      They re-did their menu sometime last month, and after dining there a few days ago, it is extremely evident to me that their major revision of their menu is pretty much just an effort to lower expenses/boost revenue, and I no longer find good value in dining there.     It's unfortunate, however I do look forward to trying the many other Italian restaurants in Henderson.   The new menu at Pasta Cucina is drastically smaller than their prior menu.  They no longer provide complimentary bread sticks with marinara & alfredo sauces for dipping.   Now it's a small loaf of warm bread, with butter & vinegar & oil with balsamic vinegar.  Most of the main courses -- at least the pastas -- used to come with a side salad or soup.  That is no longer the case.  In the past, the eggplant parmesan (& similar dishes) would come on a bed of pasta.   That's no longer the case.  I ordered a salad ($9), eggplant parmesan ($14) and an iced tea & my bill was $27.    That's insane.   Staff is still friendly, ambiance is nice, etc. but as someone who had many a meal there BEFORE they totally revised the menu to boost profits, Pasta Cucina is no-longer a place I have any interest in returning to.   I don't know how much of their business was from locals, but in looking at some other recent reviews/updates, I'm not the only 'local' to have posted about Pasta Cucina's downward trend.    What was apparently done out of desperation to boost profits may very well doom the place.    Too bad, but as I said at the beginning, I'm looking forward to spending my time & $$ trying other local Italian places now."}
{"text":"I had a $10 off coupon for Pasta Cucina from Station Casinos that come in the mail. My husband and I decided to give it a whirl.  I called and made a reservation 'cause It was a Friday night and I wanted to make sure to get a table. We got there at our scheduled time of 8pm. After waiting for a good 5 minutes for a hostess to show up we were seated, but I asked to be moved because they sat us right next to a very large group of people that included several small children. (I love kids. I just don't want to hear them scream while i'm on a date with my husband.) It took the waitress about 10 minutes to even come over to our table and then another 5 just to bring us water. Finally, she took our drink and appetizer orders. I made the mistake of kicking things off with one of their \"Specialty Cocktails\" an Italian Margarita. Yuck! Too sweet and to sour all at the same time.   For our appetizer we choose the Antipasti which came with fried mozzarella, bruschetta and calamari fritti.  Everything was surprisingly tasty. I really enjoyed the calamari fritti.   Well, I managed to finish my drink and they brought us some bread in the meantime. It took forever for the waitress to come back to ask if I wanted another drink, which is when I switched to their house white wine. We also got our entree orders in around the same time. I ordered a  pasta seafood medley that is no longer on the menu. It had shrimp, mussels, scallops in a marinara sauce over linguini. Mussels were a bit over cooked, but still was good. My husband ordered the Baked Penne. He said it was pretty basic and nothing to write home about. We both definitely have had better!  If it wasn't for the really bad service I would have scored this place a three star. Their prices are decent, but I wouldn't go back without a coupon. Especially if i'm going to have to wait sooooo long for my drinks and food."}
{"text":"Very delicious food and service is 5 stars quality! I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone that want a good Italian dinner!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place gets all the hate and bad reviews. I've been here quite a few times and never had a bad meal here or bad service. Yes it isn't 5 star Italian food but the dishes are always tasty. Ten times better than Olive Garden and for the price they give generous portions. We usually opt out of appetizers because by the time we get the breadsticks and the soup or salad that comes with your entree were basically full. I like that they serve marinara and Alfredo sauce for dipping the breadsticks in they're kind of boring on their own. I usually order chicken and artichoke pasta but my last visit I ordered the chicken piccata. I have avoided this in the past because I make a mean chicken piccata at home but the fiancé doesn't like capers so I rarely make it. It was actually quite good but I prefer mine better. Mine came with sautéed spinach but they made a mistake. It's supposed to come with pasta. When the server brought it I asked about the pasta and she said it came with spinach so I ordered a side of angel hair. When she brought the angel hair she informed me they made a mistake so I wouldn't have to pay for the pasta. I liked it with the spinach and sauce and pasta it was actually a good combination. The fiancé always orders frutti di mar which is a generous portion. Comes with mussels and seafood. Other than the slight hiccup of the pasta missing from my dish service is always alright and the food is good in my opinion. The fact it's in the smoky casino kind of sucks but we like Pasta Cucina."}
{"text":"Out favorite place for pasta that's close to home is Sunset Stations location. Food prices aren't expensive and there's always plenty to take home. We had a 2 for 1 mailer coupon and decided to eat here because well .....  the boyfriend was checking out the odds at the sportsbook anyways and we were starving ! We've never had any issues at Sunsets location. Food is consistently good service is a ok so we were thinking it would be the same here.   The decor here is way nicer a little more intimate where as Sunsets location is just an open area looking out at the casino. That's about all that's better at this Boulder location. Doesn't make sense for us to come here unless it's comped.   It's super smokey here. So smokey u can smell it all the way inside of the restaraunt.  A short visit will have your clothes and hair reeking of it. So disgusting and not so good for your health either. Yikes !   Our waitress was nice and filled our drinks quick but was nowhere to be found after as we were waiting on our breadsticks which took a while to come out. I usually go for the chicken & artichoke pasta which is consistently good at Sunset. While the taste was good here it was swimming in sauce.   Ziti with meatball & Italian sausage - it was ok. I don't understand why they would just put a hunk of ricotta on top ?   Service was alright , not bad not great. The ambiance and decor is nicer here but overall Sunset is a better choice period."}
{"text":"Ok, if you are looking for a cheap \"Italian\" dinner, then this is the place to go, they advertise that all of their entrees are under $20... But one bite into your meal, you see why. In our experience, the service was awful. We were ignored at the door, so we went to the bar. Quickly received & paid for our drinks, and told the bartender that we were waiting for a table... a few minutes later the host scurried up to the podium and told us she had a table for us. Upon being seated, we looked thru the menu, finished our drinks, and waited, and waited, and waited for our server. I'm sure our faces displayed our thinning patience, and someone (who I can only assume was a Manager or Supervisor) came over to take our drink order. We ordered our drinks, and told her that we were also ready to order our dinners... she said our server would be right over. Quite a few minutes later, or server rushed up to the table, apologized for the wait (which I respect), and offered to take our drink order... we explained that someone already had, but that we were ready to order our meals. We did so, and a couple minutes later our drinks arrived. At this point, I was beyond frustrated, and was very happy to see that our food was delivered rather quickly by a foodrunner/busser. Unfortunately, we then tasted our meals... The food was bland, small portioned, and extremely un-impressive. We had eaten appetizers at MRKT just across the way, and had decided to try Il Vino since it had recently re-opened, and appeared to be a beautiful restaurant with a classy ambiance... I wish we'd stayed at MRKT. Besides the tasteless Minestrone and Manicotti, the Caprese salad had so much salt on it, it was almost CRUNCHY. We were completely finished with our meals, and the server had not once returned to check on us. In fact, we were able to watch him visit his two other tables multiple times, while seemingly forgetting about us in the corner. We were planning on getting dessert, as we were out to celebrate our anniversary, but everything took so long that we ended up approaching another server in order to get our check, pay and leave. We expressed our dissatisfaction to the other server, and no one was ever involved to make sure we were leaving happy. I will never go back. Go to MRKT instead. :)"}
{"text":"I don't drink champagne so keep the bread sticks flowing, ahhhh, got to love this place!  I, my brothers, my boyfriend, and this little gem are the equivalent to a fun-filled, not to mention tasty evening. The ambiance alone is super nice, very chic. The food is delicious, and the prices that go along with them you can't beat. On an \"I need to stick within the confines of my budget\" kind of day this is the spot to hit up. Olive Garden will always be 'Olive Garden' but I think Pasta Cucina will be my replacement for quite some time; sorry their Bolognese topped the hell out of OG's....  I give them 4 stars because no place is perfect and leaving room for improvement can be a positive challenge where all businesses are concerned. One should always be striving for better I think! I've seen this place packed on some nights, and I've seen it the complete opposite which I like personally; in and out without a 45 min wait time I'm with it! (Grrrrr @ OG). I can go on all day about PC, but only your taste buds will be the determining factor as to (1) how long this place stays in business, (2) what the future ratings will be to keep the business flowing. Check it out, you won't be disappointed. If you are blessed to have Aaron as your waiter all the more better, he is great!"}
{"text":"Frankly I loved everything about this place but the food. So myself and my gf absolutely loved the atmosphere and the service was great. But the food itself left a lot to be desired. I think that the one at sunset station casino had much better food. If only they could send over the cooks from there to this location then this place would be perfect! A great gem at Boulder station casino"}
{"text":"This is sort of an in between review... as there is no 2 1/2 stars.. There were 5 people in our party. Three loves their meals and two hated them.  Apparently the chicken parmesan is the bomb. Everyone loved it, and the portion was huge. Seriously it's the thing to get if you are starving or just want to heat up leftovers the next night.  The breadsticks were fine, the water was great, the service was great. The waitress was very honest as far as prices go and all.  The decor makeover was very impressive, it beautiful in there now and the seating is more comfortable.  However the fancier dishes seemed to be a no no. As in they can heat things up here but not... \"cook\". Artichoke pasta was and I quote \" Disgusting like wallpaper\". I ordered veal marsala and got chicken ,I didn't make a big deal out of it immediately, but then the sauce was disgusting. Cheap sugery nasty goop. By then I would have held everyone up to have them fix my order as I did have to say something once I noticed the sauce, but I just said forget it. The waitress did offer to fix the problem.   I just ended up eating some of the chicken parm from a kind relatives plate..  The atmosphere is very nice, esp if you were going on a date etc. The service good, the food..russian roulette."}
{"text":"While not \"Little Italy\", we'll be back.  Ate here on Christmas Eve around 8PM, after being blown off for a 7:30 reservation we had at another local Italian place, when were were told \"We closed at 7\".  Our first thought was, \"What about that Italian place at Sunset Station?\"  We had not eaten there yet, but if open, we'd give it a shot.  We were greeted warmly and enjoyed a nice leisurely dinner.  Not rushed, nice staff and good food.  We both had the Chicken Marsala, which was pretty good.  The chicken was nice and thin and fork-tender.  A little light on the mushrooms, but we're comparing to my own which is more \"home made\", of course.  The bread sticks with marinara and Alfredo sauces were good.  Salads were good size.  Overall, the price was excellent for the food, taste and service.  Thank you so much for making our Christmas Eve dinner enjoyable, after a 12 hour day in our own store.  We're close so we'll be back, when we want a good, fair-priced, Italian Dinner."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 3 stars as l was very disappointed with our meal. It may be better on a different night but when we went l was unimpressed. We showed up Thanksgiving evening after a long drive from Reno. I was looking forward to a good meal, glass of wine and relaxation. Our waitress greeted us by announcing how tired she was and how annoyed she was to be working. She then made us feel bad for being there and her not being with her family. We ordered an appetizer, flatbread with grilled chicken on pesto. It was flat in every way including taste. Our meals were bland, l had angel hair pasta with chicken. And my husband had salmon. Neither meal was great. I did not finish mine nor did l take a doggie bag. We decided against dessert as we didn't want to inconvenience the waitress any more. After all as she stated, she spent all day cooking her own Thanksgiving meal and really didn't want to be working. Sorry, won't be going back here. Left a really bad taste in our mouths."}
{"text":"Well I am going to write mother review on the  Sunset station casino.  Being a top tier member I have already had the privilege of experiencing a fantastic  dinner at the Station Casinos. Tonight was no exception we had dinner at pasta Cucina and it was amazing. I had the Carbonaro and Justin had the osso bucco two must haves. My suggestion is to sit at the bar with Amber. She was so diligent and attentive and I am very hard to please when I go out to eat. Not because I am an asshole but because I work in the industry and I feel that it is hard to live up to the standard I set for my self when I am taking care of guests. The food was awesome and the service was even better. We had the Italian stallion to drink an espresso martini for dessert and a huge piece of chocolate cake to finish things off. I f you haven't dined at either of these establishments I recommend you do so. The pricing was on point for a nice dinner but had a relaxed casual feel to it. Totally adding this to the list of places to frequent."}
{"text":"Food is a bit bland. Atmosphere is good. Our waitress was nice but she would stat talking so loud every time she would come to our table. We watched people next to us almost jump out of their seats after she scared them.   Desert was really good, I did look and taste like it was made fresh on premises."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to give this place a try and we are so glad we did. We've eaten there twice and know we'll be going back again and again. So far I've had the Shrimp Scampi and the Lobster & Shrimp Ravioli and they were fantastic. Their bread-sticks and dips are by far the best we've ever had and is high on our list as our favorites. The desserts are divine and because the portion is so generous, we found it was better to share one. The staff is amazing, the attentiveness they have given us makes us want to return often. Even the leftovers are delicious! Our new favorite reasonably priced Italian restaurant!"}
{"text":"This was the worst meal I've had in a long time. I ordered the veal marsala. Simple right!... The thinnest cut I've ever experienced but that's o.k. if it has flavor, and this had NONE. No seasoning on the veal what so ever (sad) Now it gets worse..... The \"marsala\" was nothing more than a light brown gravy with mushrooms. I asked the bus person for the chef and was told there was no chef this evening , WHAT! So who's Tasting what goes out, because the manager was cleaning the plates but definitely not tasting. I had a front row view. And just a note to the management from my seat I watched a waiter eating off a plate by the coffee machines, I know this Goes on but I don't want to see It! Needless to say they would have to beg me to go back"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken piccata and it was very soupy. Ended up wearing a lot of it on my shirt. Couldn't keep the pasta and the chicken on the fork. Taste was good. A little lemony. My husband the veal Marsala. It too was a little soupy as well. Portions are just right. Bread sticks and the dipping sauces are awesome.  A lot of mixed noises from the casino.  Service was excellent. Servers were extremely nice. Price reasonable."}
{"text":"I had a coupon for this restaurant so thought I'd try it out.  It's located in the local's casino Texas Station.  The interior is nice, with a combination of tables or booths. Service was very good with an attentive waiter.  Unfortunately, the food was absolutely bleh.  Eggplant parmesan had NO flavor, no seasoning, just like eating wood.  It was on a bed of spaghetti which was dry and also utterly lacking in flavor, spices or even garlic.  A friend had the fettucine alfredo which apparently was okay, but nothing special at all.  I had hopes for the dessert (Tiramisu), but it too was underwhelming, bland, like eating nothing.  Weird!  I've had better tiramisu from the grocery store.  This is a shame because it's a pleasant place.  Not many diners in the place (maybe word has gotten out that the food isn't the best).  Nor is it the worst. Just \"meh\".  Prices are okay and portions are fairly large so at least you have leftovers for more \"meh\" dining at home lol....The Tiramisu was overpriced at $5.99. I probably won't be back again, even with a coupon. Again, it's not a \"bad\" place, it's just not a place you're gonna do anything other than eat a forgettable dinner."}
{"text":"This restaurant is inside Sunset Station casino and, having checked out the menu in passing a million times, hubby and I decided to give it a shot for dinner.  It helped that we had a $10 boarding pass coupon that we received in the mail.      Spacious and clean dining room with plenty of room in between tables.  A bit of a contemporary decor compared to the casino it's in LOL.  It's fairly open to the casino but not smokey at all.     The menu offers your typical Italian classics at reasonable prices.  Meals come with unlimited breadsticks (they kind of look like Olive Garden breadsticks but taste nothing like them) and dipping sauce (marinara and alfredo).  The marinara is a bit bland for my liking.  My cheese ravioli was good but the sauce left a lot to be desired.  Portions were decent and prices were great.   Won't be craving this restaurant any time soon and wouldn't choose to come back if it were just my husband and I... but a an OK option if you're in Sunset Station."}
{"text":"Our reservations were for 5:00 & when we arrived, sat at the high tables near the front, being sure to get our favorite server.  We quickly discovered that the menu was smaller, they had nixxed some old favorites, & no longer soup, salad or bread sticks (w/2 dips) were included, nor was a vegetable with any entree.  The prices went up as well, & we said adios.  Though we've loved Pasta Cucina for not only its chicken entrees & pastas, but the chef did a mean job with fresh fish too.  This restaurant was full most of the time.  Station Casinos also opened the new Sonoma Cellar steakhouse at Sunset & a gorgeous ambiance it is.  The prices, however, are way up there & everything is a'la carte.  We have many fine choices in the restaurant capital of America & need not drive all the way from The Lakes to dine at Sunset."}
{"text":"Strap in kids, it's going to be a bumpy ride.  We visit Sunset Station regularly and finally got around to visiting this restaurant.  We arrived on Saturday night about 7 pm and the hostess said it would be a 15 minute wait for a table (not bad) and she took our name and phone number. Then she offered to seat us immediately at a high top table near the bar right then (yay).  After we were seated, we got water served while we went over the menu but then it seemed to take forever for waitperson to take our drink and appetizer order. About 5 minutes later the \"unlimited\" breadsticks arrived (more on the later). A second waitperson showed up to take our order (WTH?), apparently the first waiter was helping the second waiter as she was chasing down someone who skipped out on their check (by the end of the meal, I could almost relate). There we sat with water and bread for another few minutes, watching the bartender running back and forth and kept coming out from behind the bar to expedite food to the patrons at the bar, but what he was not doing was making our drinks!  At 25 minutes in, we did receive our calamari which were nice and tender but the marinara is AWFUL!  It tasted of plain tomatoes and tin can.  Was kind of expecting fresh made marinara and not pre-prepared SYSCO food.  The same marinara came with the breadsticks as well as an alfredo sauce that was also lack luster.   But guess what we still don't have?  You guessed it! Our drinks!  Now we are literally 10 feet away from the bartender, he ran past us at least a dozen times.  We complained to our waitress, still no luck; it wasn't until my hubby stopped the floor manager did we finally get our drinks after we were finished with our appetizer.  The drinks were meh.  Then the salads came out, I had a caesar that was barely dressed, hubby had the  house salad that was swimming in dressing and half wilted.  We did not finish them.  So now, we are sitting there staring at one another, drinks finished, no breadsticks (what happened to the \"unlimited\"?), salad inedible only 1/2 glass of water left, when hubby's phone rings.  It is the hostess calling to tell us our table ready (if I'm lying, I'm dying), hubs informed her that she sat us a half hour ago.  At 42 minutes in to this nightmare the hubby summoned floor manager over to inform him that we were walking out.  Manager said he would get the food personally within 5 minutes, so we stayed and started a timer.  He did get the food to us within 5 minutes, managing to bus away the nasty salad plates to make room but no one bussed away all of the other empties.  BTW, no has asked if we needed another beverage or a glass of wine, including the floor manager.  The entrees were lackluster and could be considered consistent with a cheaper priced chain restaurant, we did not finish them. We were credited for our drinks and appetizer but that was 1 hour and 20 minutes of our life we can never get back.  The whole experience was so bad that if they said we'll have you back for free, we would not go."}
{"text":"Not sure how restaurants in this casino are surviving. Walked in at 9:00 PM, not a soul in the restaurant (Hey Sunday nite, what can you expect). Server was prompt took our order for brevegaes..Ice Tea..brought in the smalles ice tea glasses I've ever seen..3 gulps gone..Ordered apitizer, bread sticks, chicken marsala and chicken w/ angel hair pasta. Interlude between apitazier and main course was good.  Entraees were actually tasty..Chicken could of been grilled longer. Sauce no doubt comes out of a bag and heated. Sauted spinich...well lets just say not recently prepared..Looked like frozen chopped spinich..no garlic slivers or anything..very bland.Service was very good..for the price, nothing over $12.00 on the entree's not bad...every thing is ala carte. Give it a try if you on your way or coming from a movie and don't want the food court."}
{"text":"We came here for my parents anniversary & birthday dinner.  & Everything was perfect.  Out of 5stars Service (5):  Our server was very personable, sweet, & wonderful! Food: (4.5)  The food was delicious.  I love their lasagna & their blu-crumble cheese steak ( i dont actually remember the name of the entree i bought, but it was amazing!) & their price are worth the good   Atmosphere (5): It seems like they renovated the place because it seems like you are not inside Boulder station casino, but in a very classy restaurant.  It is very vibrant and lovely.    Tip:  They charge for a cutting fee if you bring a cake."}
{"text":"The reviews prior to this are for the old Capri Italian Ristorante.    This review is for Pasta Cucina, which Stations is trying to pass off as a new restaurant that opened in August, 2011.  Underwhelming is the best adjective I can think of for the \"new\" Pasta Cucina.  The menu is EXTREMELY similar to the old Capri menu, but somehow the dishes are much worse than before.  First we were told there was a 20-25 minute wait, but that they'd call us.  After 30 minutes I went to the hostess and she said that not only had they tried to call us but that they didn't have a table anymore.  She backed down when I offered to show her my phone which had no missed calls and we were seated at a four top.  Our waiter, Russell was horrible.  He passed by our table at least 5 times in 10 minutes without acknowledging us, getting us water, or taking our order.  When he finally came to fill our water glasses, he got distracted and proceeded to joke with another server before coming back to us.  This set the tone for rest of the meal.  We waited 10 more minutes before our bread was brought to us.    We had the Caprese Croutons, which we had ordered when this was Capri.  They used to be much better.  Tonight's were served with such thin slices of tomato that you couldn't taste it.  The balsalmic glaze, which is the reason to order this dish, was spread all over the plate with barely any on the croutons.  I ordered the manicotti and my husband ordered the meat lasagna.  When the server delivered them, he gave my dish to my husband and vice versa, and Russell just watched and didn't mention anything.  The lasagna was okay, a bit on the dry side.  But there was a whole bay leaf inside.  I don't like having inedible things in my food. The manicotti was tasty but the pasta itself was chewy and the cheese overly salty.  Twice Russell came to the table and asked how things were then left before we had a chance to answer.  One time even saying \"excellent\" as he left.  We had ordered sparkling water and had a little left over.  We asked if we could take the bottle home and he said no.  Which was fine.  However he then offered to get a styrofoam cup for us, to which we said no.  He then continued to get us said cup, poured the leftover from the bottle and then added the water that my husband had in his glass!  Why?  Good service requires listening to your customers.  Russell didn't get that.   The food has gone downhill in quality. What started out as an average Italian restaurant is now not even worth visiting."}
{"text":"Thank you Nayely and aelisabeth for your great service. The Polenta and meatball with parmagiano and Eggplant parmagiano arebon its way. Can't wait to have a taste. The last visit Chicken Marsalla did not even taste Italian. We'll have to see what happens to this order."}
{"text":"The ambiance of the restaurant is beautiful. We had to wait 20 minutes , which wasnt bad considering it was the weekend. I was a lil iffy because the reviews on yelp at the time were 50/50. We ended up liking it very much.   My husband is a med tech, and one of the ladies at the table next to us had fainted . One of the guys in charge wasn't so nice to my husband, he was just making sure the poor lady was okay.  Other then that the food was good. I wouldn't say its great but its not bad."}
{"text":"Thats right chicken piccata and I got a half of a chicken breast for $14.00!!!! Not worth it at all the wine butter sauce  is very, very bitter not a good choice.  NEVER AGAIN!!!!"}
{"text":"There were some good hits and misses here, and while they are not trying to be the best Italian in the area, this restaurant is a bargain price-wise.  Had a restaurant.com certificate and used it, where they require you order two entries to use it.  I ordered an appetizer caesar with chicken and they let me count it as an entree, which was nice because it was definitely meant to be a side salad.  The chicken on the caesar was some of the best salad chicken I've ever had.  Really excellent.  Husband had the ravioli with a side of sausage for only two dollars extra, and it was decent.   We walked out only paying $14 for two which was great.  We'd go here again simply for the price and convenience of it being in Palace Station, where we occasionally go to Bonkerz Comedy Club.  But there's much better Italian food in this town to actually go out of our way to eat here."}
{"text":"I have to give this place 5 stars!!! I have read the prior reviews and was surprised at the complaints about service and/or food. However, many of the reviews are not recent thank goodness, which leads me to believe that they must have worked out many of the kinks, because our meal was phenomenal!  We made an 8:30 reservation, so we could enjoy dinner after our show, without rushing. We arrived to an empty hostess desk and we stood there for what seemed like at least 5 minutes before someone came. The female bartender noticed us waiting and finally acknowledged us, yelling over that someone would be with us, soon. However, we barely heard her over the noise from the casino, as she kind of yelled it over her shoulder as she was turning back to deal with the bar patrons.  We were finally seated once the hostess came over and verified our reservation.   Gabriel was our server and he acknowledged and greeted us immediately, stating that he would be right with us. We ordered glasses of the Moscato D'Asti Villa Rosa. The wine was delicious! I savored every single sip! I kind of wished the glass was fuller for the  $9 per glass price, but it was fine. I'm not a big drinker  and I was there more so for the food, anyway.  I ended up ordering the Eggplant Parmesan, which came with Spaghetti Marinara, but I told them to hold the spaghetti. I just wanted the eggplant and I'm trying to eat as clean as possible. My meal also came with a side of minestrone soup (tomato based with no noodles) or a salad. I chose the soup because my natural craving and addiction to veggies was kicking my ass and I needed to soothe it. That soup was so damn good!! Hands down, the best damn minestrone I've had in a long time!! In hindsight, I wish I had asked for a pot of that stuff to go! My mom and my friend enjoyed their salads and I took a taste of it and it was good. My mom chose the house salad with Italian dressing and I really liked the dressing. It was light and a bit creamy, almost like a country Italian flavor. The breadsticks were amazing! They weren't plain like the ones at Olive Garden. There was some kind of garlic and herb seasoned crumbs on them. Delicious! They also came with a small boat of alfredo and marinara sauces. Both of them were amazing! You could tell that they were from scratch. Absolutely fantastic and flavorful!   My friend ordered the Veal Parmesan, which also came with Spaghetti Marinara and Rapini. Veal just isn't my thing, so I didn't taste it, but he said that the veal made him flashback to when he was a kid and he enjoyed that dish; like that movie Ratatouille where the restaurant critic had a flashback to when he was a kid after tasting the ratatouille. Yep! He had one of those moments. My mom ordered the Herb Marinated Chicken with Parmesan potatoes and Rapini. She said that the chicken was very good; moist and well-seasoned. It had a creamy herb-based sauce at the bottom of the platter that was very tasty. She said that the parmesan potatoes were hard and crispy on the outside and she thought they would be soft on the inside, but they weren't. She wasn't disappointed, but she was expecting a crisp outside/soft inside type of potato. She also said that the Rapini was like broccoli, only bitter so she didn't eat that.  We were way too full to have dessert, so I can't report on the taste and texture of those, but we certainly enjoyed our food. The ambiance was nice, but I wish they had walls, glass, or something up between the casino and the restaurant, because it was still loud in such a cool and relaxing environment and even sitting across from each other, we had to speak loudly. I guess it also depends on how busy the casino is, too. At times, it seemed like the noise died down and at others, it was loud. Overall, it was a beautiful restaurant and they made it look like you're dining outside in a courtyard in the middle of Italy."}
{"text":"This place has disgraced Italian food worse than the Olive Garden!  I think a spicy Italian from Subway has more Italian food goodness than the food here.  Folks,,,, it really is that bad.    The food;  Shrimp Scampi - uuughhh.  They used u90 shrimp or something... I am talking little tiny shrimp with no flavor.  I think they actually just tossed some precooked shrimp in with the pasta.  Very little garlic.  The pasta was dry.  The meal was ... FAIL.  Cheese Pizza - The crust was beyond thin... pizza crust can be thin but it has to have some type of leavening other wise it is a tortilla!  The sauce was sweet - no good.  The piece of pizza had to be folded twice to be eaten.  It was crap.  Spaghetti Bolognese - pasta was overcooked.  The sauce was basic spaghetti sauce.    I can't believe I would ever say this, but I would rather go to the olive garden!  The food is that bad.    They get one star for the nice decor.  This place is kinda retro but modern - it's stylish inside.  Very tony.  They get another star for the hostess and the little black dress..."}
{"text":"Very good food. Nice atmosphere. Very good prices. The only thing i did not like was the time it took for the food to come. But once the food did come it was good. This is the old pasta palace. But redone. It is a little off the strip, but worth it. Good odds gambling and good food are what i look for when i come to vegas. This station casino has both. If you have a car and want good italian food at a good price come here. I am a picky eater and like this alot."}
{"text":"this place is just up the street from our house and we finally decided to try it out this past Monday with some good friends! they LOVE this place and now that my boyfriend & I have been... I can understand why! the price and food is phenomenal!! we each ordered a 'personal pizza' which had about 8 thin slices for $5! all their appetizers were $3... mac & cheese, chicken sliders, potato crisps, etc... I highly recommend this place! either eating at the bar or even inside the restaurant area, the pasta dishes are under $15. Definitely a hidden treasure at the Aliante Casino!! FOUR STARS +++++++ for sure!! :)"}
{"text":"They have gluten-free spaghetti and penne pasta. I believe the reviews may be harsh. So I liked it. Debs had a shrimp and clam linguini with gluten free spaghetti. I had the baby clams and the portion was a little small. Our servers were very nice. Thank you."}
{"text":"If you like to go out to dinner to be ignored by the hostess and the wait staff then I highly recommend this restaurant.    We waited 10 minutes for the hostess to appear at the desk.  When she finally appeared she was on the phone and did not even acknowledge us.  After several minutes on the phone she finally hung up and seated us.  We then waited another 10 minutes for our server to come to our table.  Every part of our meal was slow and the quality of food was sub standard.  It took an act of God to get our water glasses filled as well.    Given the state of our economy don't waste your money at this establishment."}
{"text":"gotta  say this place was surprisingly good . i had a reservation and ended up a half hour late and they where cool about it first off. for appetizers we had the bruschetta and fried mozzarella and it was delicious (the balsamic reduction was amazing on the bruschetta ). the wine list was very reasonable had a 08 bottle of the duck horn decoy that was no less than exceptional. i had the chicken Marcella that was pretty good. the service was a little bit slow but it looked like this was due to them cutting the floor early. will definitely go back for a nicer Italian place that is not stupid in pricing"}
{"text":"gotta say this place ranks pretty good, the food is good especially the veal Marsala! and the pricing on everything is pretty cheap. the wine list has a couple gems hidden in there as well for a very reasonable price point. the only down fall of this place is the service is sometimes questionable."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend this place for Italian dining on a budget. It's as Italian as Olive Garden without the endless bread sticks and pasta so most people will accept it. I enjoyed the food and the servers did well. I was confused with their look; white shirts, ties and black waist aprons... but blue jeans and street shoes? Kinda blows the illusion of finer dining the white cloth tabletops and swanky bar gives, just as the open wall to casino floor spoils too. But they control the flow of customers so there is a wait which keeps down the noise and crowding so you can be more comfy and intimate. That's MUCH better than Olive Garden. If you avoid buffets, want to relax and not worry about having a bad experience while you are in the casino, Pasta Cucina is my pick unless I REALLY want Mexican... then it's Cabo."}
{"text":"This place is a regular for my fiancé and I. We have been coming here for years and have had a great experience every time. Probably one of the cutest decorated Italian restaurants I've seen yet!   The portions are very large especially the spaghetti and meatballs or the chicken Alfredo. You can definitely split it.  You don't have to but sometimes it's in your best interest to make a reservation because this place can get crowded.   The only reason I rate it 4 out 5 stars is because of new management changing the menu and increasing the prices."}
{"text":"While I love Sunset Station, my recent experience here was not good!  The food is very good, but the service was horrible!  I took my friend to this restaurant for a nice dinner.  The whole time we had to flag down anyone that would walk by our table for anything we needed as we saw our waitress maybe twice.  We were never asked if we needed more wine, water, if we wanted dessert, etc.  We had to flag someone down to ask where our wine was, where our salad was, where our dinner was.  I will not be going back after this experience.  I see the review below about the waitress having someone skip out on the bill and apparently, we were there on the same night with the same waitress and my story is almost identical to hers!  It was NOT a good night."}
{"text":"Just a really great meal for a super affordable price! I had a birthday dinner here and they served me a complimentary dessert (cannolis) which is always a classy thing to do for a birthday.  The atmosphere is very cool with lemon \"trees\" and a painted sky ceiling. The appetizer sampler we shared was very yummy and I enjoyed my veal marsala greatly! The sauce was tasty and it was a good sized portion for the price.  The Caesar salad that came with my entree was pretty big and very fresh! I'm not a big fan of Italian cuisine and this place would be one that I'd return to. Their martinis are impressive and a good price at $6. Our party of 5 all had an enjoyable time and we all agreed we'd come back."}
{"text":"Two of us had an early dinner here on a weeknight in October when we were staying at the hotel, and we enjoyed it very much!  Having read some recent not-so-great reviews, I warned Husband that I wasn't sure what we were in for, but we had a very good experience, from the service to the quality of the food.      Bread was really good and served with both butter and oil. We shared the Caesar which came with some fried anchovies, which always makes me happy.  Husband wanted just the Fried Mozzarella, which he enjoyed thoroughly while I chowed down happily on my Baked Penne that had a small amount of meatball and sausage in it.  Just the right amount of meat and cheesy goodness.  Prices reasonable as well!"}
{"text":"Good classic Italian dishes - Chicken Parmesan and Eggplant Parmesan are winners. Caesar salad is also quite good. And fresh baked bread. Super yum. Sat at the bar and had great, quick service. Amber was awesome."}
