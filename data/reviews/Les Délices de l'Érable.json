{"text":"Cute place but underwhelming sweets and coffee. The gelato did not look fresh and, in fact, looked like it ha smelted and been refrozen. Our cashier/server was so nice, so that was a plus."}
{"text":"Les Délices de l'Érable is one of the nicer places to chill out before a flight. Great roasts and a maple syrup latte that's heaven will make you wonder why you didn't come earlier. There's a Starbucks behind which isn't competition in terms of flavor or ambience.   There's a variety of grab and go items as well as things you can take the time to savor. Airports are often sterile and irritating places but Les Délices de l'Érable is a nice place to take it easy for a few minutes.   There's samples and produce to go so while the coffee or tea's cooling you can get a guilty free fix. Nothing beats a syrup shot at 6am."}
{"text":"All things maple!   Maple desserts (cookies, tarts, macarons, gelato, drinks, etc.), plus maple products including syrup (of course!), butter, dressings, and even body cream, scrubs, etc.  The first thing I did was check the desserts...and we were kindly greeted by a server named Val. She quickly realized it was our first time at the store, so she showed us to a table filled with maple products.   This is definitely one of those 'touristy things' that some might avoid, but my boyfriend and I enjoyed our visit. Val was very knowledgeable as she taught us about the production of maple syrup. Little did we know...maple sap is collected at different times throughout the season, which results in different colours and tastes of the syrup. We got to sample each of the four syrups they offer (for free!), and any other products we wanted to try. It was very interesting, especially the variety of products they offer. (They even make maple-flavoured cotton candy!) I walked out of there with a jar of Maple Spread and the Classic Maple Dressing. Mmm... =9  I returned to the desserts and there, Val offered us a small sample of Maple Taffy on crushed ice, and I also ordered a scoop of Maple Nutella gelato. We enjoyed our treats downstairs where there is a small, but very informative museum all about maple.  If you love maple (or all things sweet) and/or if you love to cook, you'll enjoy a visit to Maple Delights."}
{"text":"Definitivement la meilleurs place à aller pour les passionnés d'erable. Le staff est tellement gentil, ce feront un plaisir de vous faire des dégustations. Je conseil tout honnêtement! Aussi un excellent endroit pour des idées cadeaux. Bouteille d'érable grand marnier très abordables. Un incontournable."}
{"text":"Excellent gelato with maple syrup, sorbets ...explosion of flavors...we almost didn't stop here but I wanted something sweet for my nice who is enrolled at McGill and looked like she didn't want to go back to the dorms so early. We have not seen her in a month so we gave The London Fog tea a try. Everybody behind the counter appeared to be new/ in training, we didn't mind. Well I did a little,,, when the London tea came in a paper cup and not four layered like in the picture. Disappointed.....erased one star for that."}
{"text":"Sure it's touristy but the maple brown sugar gelato was a great treat after walking thru too many kitschy souvenir shops.  Add a shot of maple syrup on top of your gelato for only a quarter.  Skip the museum in the basement and the expensive \"fancy syrup\".  Just go for the gelato."}
{"text":"Alles was mit Ahronsirup zu tun hat gibt es hier. u.a. leckeres Ahorneis"}
{"text":"Loved they spend the time to explain the maple and give you tastes of as much as you want. Of course the maple sugar candy, maple macaroon, maple latte were all delicious! Great place to learn and taste this Canadian staple."}
{"text":"Loved the maple snow, gelato and coffee. However, it was the employees who made the place special. They were knowledgeable, very polite and turned a store visit into an experience."}
{"text":"J'adore cette place qui fait honneur au Quebec et l'Erable .J'aime surtout les préparation glacée à l'érable.Un vrai délice quand il fait chaud!"}
{"text":"To the fine folks who keep Canada secure, my husband was clearly part of an international syndicate of syrup smugglers.  But rather than make a run for the gate, he stepped out of the security line, explained that he's just a mad-for-maple tourist who forgot about the 3-ounce rule, and checked the gigantic bottle of Les Delices syrup carefully wrapped in layers of T-shirts and nestled in his carry-on.  Les Delices is in the middle of Vieux Montreal, part of the Old-Europe-type architecture that fascinates us Americans.  I know, we're suckers for even going into such a touristy spot, but Barack apparently brought Michelle a box of Les Delices cookies, so of course we had to have some.  I agree with the other reviewer that the people who work there are really nice, even for Canadians.  One girl offered samples when we were visibly overwhelmed by the choices (maple candy, cookies, wafers, syrup, etc.) and helped us choose between the endless varieties of maple-based snacks.  (Not that this is relevant, but she was also really cute; I would have totally gone back to the hotel to grab my brother were he not there with his girlfriend.)  Oh, the cookies.  They're pleasant, but not terribly maple-y or anything spectacular (insert quip about Canada, if you must).  Of course, that didn't keep me from going through almost a whole box in a week.  And you know what?  Whatever's good enough for the First Lady is good enough for me."}
{"text":"I get so excited prior to my Canada trip when I know I am gonna seek out items that are infused in Maple. That would mean I will consume more desserts than amazing savory on a daily basis which I know it sounds unhealthy. But I care less when I am on the go but will make sure I will be good when I get home in a month's time.  Maple Delights speaks for itself, it houses maple specialties for their famed gelato range, wider range of maple candies, syrups at a reasonable tag compared to some souvenir shops along the streets of Old Montreal (comparing prices is a must prior to making any purchase). The maple candy (drops in cream hue) are going for $3.50/12s in a pack which seems to be cheaper than $2/4s at one of the stalls along Old Port which sells Maple Taffy.   I heard of this gelato shop while reading reviews on Yelp Canada and bookmarked it without hesitation. I was here on yesterday (Mon) but left empty handed as all the maple flavored gelato has been completely sold out due to the weekend crowd! Need I say any further? I am convinced even without eating it.  And so I made a second attempt to return today. I was told to go back at lunch time so that the gelato will be available. I did as told. I stepped into the shop to see a few sweet toothed sitting at one of the high seats, enjoying their scoops.   I marched up the counter and requested for a few samples. I tried all the maple flavored gelato: Maple Delights, Maple biscuits, Maple Chunks, Maple & Cranberry. I adamantly vote for the best seller: Maple Delights. It came close to Maple Chunks except that Delights has somewhat outshine with a noticeable and mellow maple fragrant. It has a good mixture of walnut bits, very nutty and goes well with its creamier texture, extra depth to it. The Maple biscuit version comes with fine biscuit crumbs while the Maple cranberry one is less memorable as I could only find traces of cranberry flavor and it dominates the wonderful maple scent which I didn't like. I'd prefer a more identifiable maple taste for a maple gelato, that's the centerpiece, isn't it supposed to be?   The staffs are very friendly and service is gracious. The only regret is I couldn't get hold of a maple macaron when I was asked to return on a Tuesday. Instead, it only arrives on Thursday. Apparently, the lady got mixed up between the word Tuesday & Thursday until her co-worker corrected her that today is a Tuesday when she kept saying a Thursday. Aw...okay, that's excusable since most natives are French speaking.   Waffle cone sells at $4.00. Plain Waffle goes for $3.00 while waffle with a scoop of ice cream begs for $4.00. I had a cup with a single scoop at $2.95 and my sister opted for a regular cone, single scoop for the same price. Most  kids are chowing down a regular portion unless they are willing to swap for a mini cone for $1.60 which I doubt.  Don't leave the place without going to the basement!!! Besides going to the washrooms, there's a mini maple museum that speaks the process of maple harvesting! I gained quite a good deal on that, I get to appreciate those maple even more now. There are more seats at the basement, so I encourage u to visit the museum and have a look there. Absolutely nothing to loose. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ohh... Les délices de l'érable!... C'est un indispensable... Ça vient toucher une corde sensible!... L'on trouve plusieurs boutiques dans le Vieux-Montréal où les produits de l'érable sont en vente. Mais, à ce que je sache, il n'y a rien, mais vraiment rien qui ne surpasse ce bistro-musée entièrement dédié au meilleur de ce qui se fait en terme de sirop pur...et biologique...  J'aime mon café noir et sans sucre, et ça m'a pris du temps à me décider avant d'essayer un americano à l'érable, car évidemment, l'on en rajoute dans toutes les sortes de café (si l'on le désir, évidemment). Mais au bout du compte, je trouve ça trop sucré. C'était comme si je venais d'échapper le sucrier; vous savez, quand ça ne goûte même plus le café... En fait, je n'aurais peut-être pas dû rajouter en surplus un bonbon à l'érable (qu'on donne en dégustation). C'est ma faute... Mais enfin, le sirop est excellent, oui, mais je le préfère quand même en dehors de ma tasse... En revanche, l'amandine fourrée au beurre d'érable est tout simplement délectable. Il faut la prendre réchauffée au four...  On peut sinon choisir entre quelques aguichantes sucreries et viennoiseries : mousse, tartes, sorbets, gelatos, etc...  Le bistro a une section cadeau où sont disponibles plusieurs produits de l'érable à emporter tels des bonbons au beurre (sève malaxée), des biscuits, du café aromatisé au sucre d'érable, du thé vert (!), ainsi que plusieurs sortes de sirops traditionnels (clair, ambré, foncé) et aromatisés (Grand Marnier, rhum, bleuets, canneberges)...   Le musée historique est à l'étage d'en dessous (gratuit) et se veut nous instruire sur la production de l'érable; de la cueillette jusque dans l'assiette...  -À ne pas manquer : De la tire sur neige est offerte à longueur d'année au comptoir!.. On est loin du sirop de poteau!.."}
{"text":"Unique maple products that you can sample before you buy. Friendly staff too! I live in Nova Scotia so I've had lots of mapple syrup in my time but I've never seen these maple spreads or jellys before."}
{"text":"Maple everything... Yum!!! We had the gelato- maple chunk and also pistachio- both of which tasted a lot like maple!"}
{"text":"Yelp! helped us find this perfect spot for an early afternoon tea. Staff spoke English for us (thank you!) and made excellent suggestions. My partner's Maple Cappuccino was very good - nice strong cafe. My Maple Black Tea with steamed milk and an side of maple syrup instead of Splenda was warm and yummy in this cold October day. Located in the old city of Montreal, the interior is tres moderne with lovely world music. Maple cookies, cakes and breads along with gelato complete the food options. You'll love this place!"}
{"text":"Situé dans une rue touristique, ce petit magasin propose une multitude de produits à base d'érable. Autant de produits à manger sur le moment que des souvenirs à ramener chez soi. Il est également possible de déguster gratuitement quelques produits."}
{"text":"If you need to pick up unique maple-inspired souvenirs, Maple Delights can help you out with that.The store does sell some maple-based cosmetics, syrups, and spice rubs, which you can sample. I passed on that experience, due to the crowds. I was expecting this place to be the end-all be-all of maple-based products.  But the first thing we encountered was a gelato counter with only 2-3 maple-inspired flavors.  I had tasted much better gelato in the area earlier in the week, so I don't think I would recommend going to Maple Delights for gelato. The pastry counter was also lacking in maple-inspired offerings, although they had a few items. If you go downstairs, there is a nice display that provides a crash course on the the history of maple syrup manufacturing. That was a nice touch."}
{"text":"This is located in the Old Port area. Great maple inspired food souvenirs to bring home. Staff friendly. They offered to give you a taste of every product that they had."}
{"text":"The service is very friendly and they have a good selection of things to taste and buy.  It is a bit overhyped in the tourist guides.  I find more tings in a proper sugar shack/house at a much reduced price...but, this is Old Montreal and many folks will not get out and go to the sugar houses while they are open.   So for the good stuff, Sugar on Snow (maple syrup poured over ice) until it reached taffy like consistency is fantastic.  Maple cream (vanilla soft serve flavored with maple syrup) is also very good.  Then there is the pastries that are either made with or glazed with maple syrup.  We had several at our table and sampled them all.  Fantastic."}
{"text":"One step into Les Délices del l'Érable and you're suddenly transported into a naturally sweet wonderland of all things maple and honey. This shop has everything from gelato and fresh baked goods to barbecue sauce and tea. If I wasn't about to catch a flight the next day, I would've made a necessarily large purchase because I LOVE maple syrup.   They have little sample stations set up where're you can taste the different offerings to narrow down your decisions and learn about the product. I love that everything is natural and that the employees are so educated and excited about what they're selling. You can also sample the gelato that is sweetened by maple and honey for an organically sweet and refreshing taste.   They sell gift baskets which is great to take home to whoever couldn't make it, but I settled for a lemon honey to add to my tea. I'm trying so hard to make it last! A perk for travelers is that they have a website where you can order and have whatever you want shipped, so I might have to try that out! Thanks so much to the friendly and helpful staff!"}
{"text":"While we all could use a little gelato in our lives (and from Montreal, no less!), I couldn't find myself falling in love with this place as so many other gelato  aficionados profess to here. Les Delices is easy to find in Old Montreal. It's practically the first shop past the Notre Dame Basilica.    After perusing many options and samples, we opted for their signature cookie and maple syrup ice cream. It does has a nice gritty texture from the cookie, but it was just way too sweet after a few bites (felt like I was floating).   I do like that this store has tours (didn't go) of how they make their products and that they have an extensive cafe and bakery included. Worth a stop ... if at the very least to great free samples. :)"}
{"text":"Lots of maple gift items. You can even have maple gelato flavors and maple taffy!  Come support in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"Gelato is good & creamy but nothing extraordinary. $3 for a tiny scoop makes this quite pricy. Go for the maple flavors as these are their specialties. The lime is tart and tangy. The raspberry is fruity and tart. Once you get your treat, head outside for some people watching and you most likely will encounter a street performer, or several as well."}
{"text":"This place is magical! It was raining and my friends and I were wandering around downtown Montreal hoping to get some good souvenirs when we stumbled along this place. We were greeted at the door with samples of maple coffee. The staff was so friendly and offered to let us sample just about anything in the store. They have a wide variety of products, mostly maple-related, as well as a case of fresh baked goods and gelato. We tried their coffee, tea, and maple cones and all were excellent.  Their maple cone put the cones you see everywhere else around the city to shame. There is a store area as well as a seating area by the fireplace. The atmosphere is cozy and clean."}
{"text":"This a fun little spot on Rue Saint-Paul, and perfectly positioned among a bunch of restaurants. If you're looking for some delicious gelato, drop by Delices Erable & Cie, and you won't be disappointed.   In addition to the aforementioned delicious Italian treat, they also sell a number of other trinkets, cookies, coffee, and the like. The store feels like a warm, well-lit home, and you can take a load off and drink in everything on display.   Check out their pure maple syrup, delicious honey, and tart cranberry products. They also have caramel, green and maple tea, baked brie, maple spread, dijon marinade, and maple waffles. It's seriously like a maple heaven.   Also, if you're a tourist, this is the perfect place to find some great souvenirs! And similarly, a great place to find a gift :)"}
{"text":"This place is fun for kids!  I also love their maple ice cream.  There are a lot of things to look at (including an interesting museum downstairs).  Anything maple you could dream of, you can get here.  I especially love the ice creamery and bakery area.  I try to go every time I go to Montréal."}
{"text":"Perfect! Excellent coffee and they gave our kids free maple candy bc it wasn't the best conditions...kids didn't notice!"}
{"text":"This is a fun treat shop to go to. Everything is sweetened with maple syrup! It give the gelato a unique taste that reminds me of a sweet pancake breakfast. They also sell other maple syrup \"enhanced\" products like body lotion and liquid soap. Those didn't appeal to me as much. Go in for the treats and you will be satisfied. It's a bit touristy but it's still a genuine store with a seemingly unique flavor!"}
{"text":"This place was probably one of the highlights of my Canada trip. A cute little spot in Montreal, Maple Delights features some incredible products and an incredible mini tour you can have downstairs with a store employee who can take you through a maple syrup testing exercise and then lead you upstairs to browse the store.  I tried one of the cookies and some of the chocolate pieces, and everything was to DIE for. I wish I could have bought 100 things, and I wanted to make time later in the week to come back for more treats but I couldn't fit it into my schedule.   This place is an absolute GEM-- please, please do yourself a favor and stop by. The gelato is fantastic, as are the pastries/cookies and other small treats. Don't forget to try the frozen maple syrup sticks, and ask tons of questions while you're there!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a crazy and amazing place! We stopped in here for a quick snack and figured you couldn't go wrong with maple syrup-based everything. We got maple syrup coffee, tea, and small desserts, which were all amazing. That alone would warrant it 4 stars, but as we were browsing the gift shop, one of the workers offered us a completely free maple syrup tasting! It was so cool and it was really neat to taste the differences between different grades of maple syrup, which is something I had seen on bottles, but never really knew what it meant. He also gave us complimentary maple taffy, which is syrup that's poured onto ice (or traditionally, snow) and wrapped around a popsicle stick to make a treat. So cool! This place was a favorite of ours and it's definitely worth a stop in if you're walking around Old Montreal!"}
{"text":"If you are in Montreal you HAVE to stop by this adorable café. I walked into this place to get a maple latte, little did I know they have maple flavored everything in here, and I mean everything, from maple gelato to maple body scrub items. Best place to get souvenirs! I ended up leaving with my delicious latte and a bag full of maple flavored items. We were able to leave the store then we found out they have a small free maple museum downstairs, so obviously we had to check it out and get educated on all things maple. The place is pretty small and gets very crowded, but stick around because it is fun. Oh did I mention they have free maple tastings? They even sell a type of maple syrup that's illegal in the US, so pretty exciting!"}
{"text":"Excellent Gelato. The workers are very friendly and knowledgable.  I enjoyed the pistachio gelato and it was excellent.  My family had other which they absolutely loved."}
{"text":"Only spot I saw the double flavored maple syrup souvenir. Clearly a tourist buy, but a cool purchase.  The 2 stars is for the cashier service -- when paying, the cashier handed me the credit card machine, then I inserted my card, then he literally walked out from behind the counter and physically left the store for about 90 seconds before returning -- now, 90 seconds might not seem like long, but when you're just standing there wondering what the hell just happened and how to finish your transaction, it's a while. He finally came back and sarcastically applauded me when we finished the transaction (I guess I was somehow supposed to know how to finish it on my own? I'm still confused as to what happened). Anyway, this was one of a handful of interactions in Quebec where we felt blatant condescension from service workers that seemed pretty uncalled for so 2 stars for lack of customer service."}
{"text":"Awesome maple chocolate, awesome maple coffee and great service. Everything maple! Little hard to find as the name is not in English but it's also in a great neighborhood. Lots of maple sample samples to try too. They have these white chocolate maple leaf chocolates filled with maple cream (?) and while my son didn't like the filling I found them to be the most delicious chocolates I've tasted in a long time. Definitely look out for this place and avoid the other \"souvenir type\" places that feature the same maple products, because the stuff here is top notch and really tasty ( and maple-ly)."}
{"text":"A shop dedicated to maple syrup. It was a good setup. As you can expect, most, if not all, were desserts. As I hadn't eaten dinner yet, decided to get a maple latte. Was just over priced coffee where you use maple syrup instead of sugar. Thought it would have been something different, but it wasn't. Nothing special."}
{"text":"I never leave Montreal without maple syrup and Les Delices Erable & Cie is the place to do buy.  Tasting, sweet treats and gourmet finds summarizes this boutique bistro perfectly...you can be sure your getting quality maple syrup and the prices are really good. Watch out for deals!  Don't forget to try the maple taffy on snow ($2).  I bought the travel easy syrup pouches (if like me,your worried about the glass bottle breaking). The pouches are such a space saver and weigh much less. You also get more for your buck."}
{"text":"I was going to be extremely upset leaving Montreal without buying any souvenirs until I past by this little gem. When I went, the place was crowded with a lot of people. There were samples of everything, I just had to go to every stand to check out all the products. The price of these goodies are also fair. There were a wide variety of maple syrups and syrups in many forms. If you ever visit Old Montreal, you should definitely stop by this store. I bought 2 huge bags of souvenirs and only spent around 120 CAN."}
{"text":"Eh. I was underwhelmed. About the best thing I can say is that they had a semi-clean restroom (only one that day; the second was out of order).  I wanted to go because there was a site that said this location had a \"Maple Museum\". I do so love museums. But when we got there, it was so uninspired. They had information on the walls, sure, and some pieces of equipment specific to the maple trade, but it seemed to fall well short of \"museum\" status.  So, the \"museum\" (and the restroom) is downstairs. Upstairs, you have the shop, which will sell you all things maple - from souvenirs to gelato to drinks. Neither of us had ever had real maple syrup before, so we were eager to sample the true maple wares. We stood in the long line snaking around the store in order to get a couple of gelatos and cookies (because we had to have a decent sampling, right?) before escaping the crush of people upstairs to snag a small, dirty table downstairs.  I'm sure this is my Americanized-palate speaking, but I wasn't a fan of the gelato. I'm glad I only got one scoop. It wasn't that it wasn't very sweet (which I was okay with, to be honest). No, to me, at least, there was an off-taste that I wasn't fond of. I didn't want to say anything to my husband, because I didn't want to complain about something that I had been so gung-ho about, but he asked me what I thought, and I wasn't about to lie to him.  He actually agreed, which makes me think that it IS the fact that we're used to the fake stuff that threw us.   We didn't eat the cookies at that point - we were both full from lunch and the gelato - but we did eat them later that day, and again, that off-flavor that neither of us can put our finger on was present in the cookies, as well.  So, is it fair to give such a low rating based on my dislike of the food? Maybe not, but let me also say this: the employees were not friendly that day. Yes, they were busy, but I don't think that gives servers free reign to be flat-out nasty to customers. Further, the downstairs \"museum\"/eating area had a general grunge to it that made me wonder when it was last cleaned, and the bathroom needed some real attention.  It was an experience, yes, but not one that either of us wanted to repeat during our time in Montreal."}
{"text":"I really loved the maple gelato that I stopped for while I awaited my flight connection. The portion was HUGE! While I didn't get the two scoops of the day for the price of one promotion (I'm glad I didn't as that would have been FAR too much to eat), I tasted a number of samples before settling on the maple gelato with maple leaf cookie bits as my final option.  This shop also sold a number of delicious maple themed items (and they have sampling!). It was well worth a visit while I connected through this airport on my way home."}
{"text":"Dessert before dinner? Oui Oui!  I'm glad I stumbled upon this little gem before leaving Old Montreal.  They have plenty of gelato flavors to choose from. I went with the Maple syrup and nutella and it was delicious!  They also sell maple syrup and other frozen desserts.  There is a downstairs level that sells the same thing, with an entrance towards the pier.  Free wifi and nice little seating area outside so you can chill and people watch!"}
{"text":"I'll admit it: I didn't want to fall for this obvious tourist trap. But I'm so glad I did. Even if you don't like maple overload, come here. It'll change your mind.  A small store in Vieux Montreal, Maple Delights has absolutely all things maple, from maple oil to maple gelato and ice cream, to alcoholic maple coffee, to maple butter... essentially anything your heart desires, you can put maple in front of the word and it'll most likely be sold here. The workers here are friendly, patient, and extremely knowledgeable.  One one side of the store, you can ask for countless samples of gelato. I'd recommend anything that has \"maple\" in it, obviously, but the coffee maple combination was my favorite. On the other side, there's a worker explaining all the different maple products the store sells. Head downstairs for a small informational but not terribly exciting tour of the history of maple syrup.  Back upstairs, I ordered a small maple cappuccino. The coffee itself was standard and nothing mind-blowing, but the foam impressed me. The best part, though? The maple syrup mixed into the coffee and the maple sprinkles topping the drink. If I could come back to Canada and order this again, I definitely would. I'd also buy out the entire store while I'm at it. Give into the tourist trap. No regrets."}
{"text":"From the quality of product to the exceptional service, this spot really delivers. I bought quite a few gifts to bring back home. I'm not a huge maple syrup fan, but this stuff really hit the spot. Their sampling helps you pick out what will be right to take home, but also their knowledgeable staff helps you understand how to prepare something good at home (besides a topping for pancakes!). Traveling throughout the Quebec region, there is maple syrup in a lot of touristy shops. This one is gourmet, and can really feel the difference.  A must stop."}
{"text":"Came with the wife to get some good local flavor dessert. We both had the ice cream (or gelato, not sure). The flavored were pretty expected but tasted very natural. They had baked goods (most we're gone as we didn't go until around 8PM) and gift packs for sale around the store. There was a downstairs area and outside seating. Would definitely go back and try some other flavors."}
{"text":"Ah, the sweet smell of maple things, the visual excellence of shelves of syrup and cases stocked with baked goods and pans of sweet gelato. The friendliness of the counter staff as they eagerly get you to sample the various flavors in the case. Mmmm Tourist mentality.  In general it was a fantastic little shop to hit in Montreal while we were there. Their basement has a little museum that explains the syrup process with various pictures and stories. Their main floor as stated above is mainly for the food and gift shopping. I got the maple gelato with maple bits, sweet, simple, fantastic. The glass of milk washed it all down nicely.  Fiancee tried the passion fruit which was \"tangy and incredibly refreshing, and you can quote me on that.\" Ok I will.  If you're in Vieux Montreal and find yourself nearby, definitely give this sweet spot a stop."}
{"text":"This is maple heaven.   It has maple pastries and desserts, drinks sweetened with maple, maple candy, and other maple products for sale. They gave us maple syrup on a stick to try, where they have a bottle of maple syrup, squeeze some on a bed of crushed ice, put a popsicle stick on an end of that syrup, then roll the hardened syrup onto the popsicle. They also let you sample the different maple products they sell, which they have an extensive selection of. They even have maple butter spread, maple tea, maple salad dressing, maple mustard.  I had a maple cookie, maple almond croissant, and warm maple milk. I ordered too much just for myself and it was sugar overload for my first meal of the day. Everything was delicious and I finished every bite and drop despite the high sugar intake."}
{"text":"After two months in Paris, I stayed over in Montreal. I can say the Maple Macaroons here were the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Service here is top notch. We stopped in out of curiosity while we were in Old Montreal and were immediately offered to go through a free tasting with one of the workers. I'd never understood the maple syrup craze before, but now that I've tasted real maple syrup (not the super processed stuff from the grocery stores) I understand. It tastes AMAZING and makes a world of difference. The shop itself is cute, clean, and the workers are great. We bought some maple syrup souvenirs (one in a really cute glass bottle imported from Italy) and also got some pistachio ice cream which we enjoyed as well!"}
{"text":"maple. fudge.  are. you. fucking. kidding. me.  sweet jesus on a biscuit."}
{"text":"Great customer service. They obviously know there maple. The maple iced tea with amber syrup is phenomenal, not on the menu though."}
{"text":"After walking around Old Town in Montreal for a while without impulse buying Indian artifacts or tourist T-shirts, we stumbled into this cute maple syrup specialty shop. Everything in the store is made of or with maple syrup.   I tried the maple leaves cookies after browsing around and had to pick something that is not completely sinful. It is small but packed with sweetness and I wish I had got more!   They also have a small corner in the back where they offer tasting and a little education on maple syrups and other products. I had a bite of their pie and it was great too."}
{"text":"Touristy store in Old Montreal specializing in maple syrup products. They definitely sell a lot of maple syrup products you can't find at other tourist shops. They also have a store in Quebec City and at the airport if you can't make it to this one.  While the products were interesting all I bought here was ice cream. I was convinced by the salesperson to try the maple chunk ice cream which was really good. They also had other maple flavored ice creams as well as more typical flavors. I would recommend this place if looking for unique maple syrup products to take back home with you."}
{"text":"This place is great.  After browsing for a few minutes, we received a demonstration on the different grades of maple syrup with a tasting. Of course this lead to my wife buying some.  But that's ok, this is some delicious high end maple syrup.  When we were paying, the cashier threw in a bunch of maple candies for us to taste.  They are delicious and we will be going back before we go home."}
{"text":"This place gets an extra star because they have super clean public restrooms located on the lower level. Woohoo! Wandered in for a bathroom break (directed here by another shop owner) and then enjoyed taking a look at the small, one room maple museum. Upstairs the shop sells maple EVERYTHING. We tried some of the maple gelato as well as the maple macaron. Fun little store to check out."}
{"text":"Everything maple! We ended up buying the maple butter as a souvenir and it has made my pancakes so much better."}
{"text":"Got my fix of sorbet here and I must day it was good, not really what I expect from a sorbet though.  Kind of.. Creamy? Almost like Gelato. But still good though. Tasted the strawberry, mango and lemon sorbet, lemon was the best!"}
{"text":"This place is a great way to try all sorts of maple! Our group tried the ice cream, chocolates, smoothies and everyone was happy."}
{"text":"This place is maple-amazing!!  My husband and I popped in here without realising it was a maple mecca - we were just in need of some iced tea/coffee. Once I got to the counter I saw that they had maple iced tea and maple iced coffee, so I ordered one of each. It was soooo good! Seriously all iced tea should be maple-a-fied!!   One of my colleagues asked me to bring back some maple syrup cookies from Canada...so a few days later I came back to buy some of those as well. This shop did not disappoint! I bought a couple of large boxes of maple cream cookies...and so the main noise in my office at this very moment is \"oishiiiiiiii\" (yum!) as my Japanese colleagues munch there way through them! They go REALLY well with tea.   We also bought some maple syrup (how could we not!?) and tried a couple of the maple gelato ice-creams. It is all great. Good work Canada. Good work.  * They also have a store in Montreal airport after you make it through security...so don't worry if you leave your cookie-purchases to the last second."}
{"text":"Lots of samples of delicious maple products. They sell nice gift sets, maple syrup treats, ice cream, coffee, and baked goods. They also have maple on snow, which reminds me of my childhood winters in Canada!"}
{"text":"Visited this place almost daily on my recent trip to Montreal with friends. Its located in Old Montreal on a street that's blocked off in the evening for pedestrian traffic an filled with various eateries, shops, and bars.   I think everyone should check this shop out at least once! It is filled with maple deliciousness. There is ice cream, cookies, cakes, chocolates, macarons, and various other maple goodies. Ice maple latte was my morning ritual. And I fell in utter love with their fresh baked maple chocolate chip cookies (oh man... I want some now... bad idea writing this review.... craving time...)  Really there's something yummy for everyone here. And unless you live in Canada good maple treats are hard to find, so take advantage!"}
{"text":"We randomly came across maple delights when we were walking around old Montreal. I was excited to find a shop that specializes in maple because I love maple. And I was dying to try some authentic Canadian maple. We were there pretty early so they had not put up their ice cream flavors yet but an employee told me they are all made with maple sugar. They had a large display of muffins, cookies and other baked goods all dipped in maple. They also had a sample station and they let you try stuff like maple butter. We settled on buying a maple crumb muffin. It was delicious and very maple-y. I would love to go back on another trip to Montreal and try their maple ice creams."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in the old port, I stop here to treat myself. I'm not much of a regular ice cream or gelato eater, but I can't resist the goods here! EVERYTHING is sweetened purely with maple syrup, the most delicious and nourishing sugar a body can consume (tree blood with tree vitamins, peeps!). So, I check my guilt at the door and indulge. Many options for cones, too - including my favourite waffle cones. Last time I was in, I got the maple cookie and maple chunk gelato, and my partner got the maple and nutella mix - gotta say, I'm going for the maple nutella gelato next time! So good. The place is a tad touristy, like you'd expect in Old Montreal, but you're just there for the treats and then on your way back out to hit more cobblestone, cone in hand. Makes the gawking and browsing more special!"}
{"text":"Nice place to warm us up after walking in the cold ( though they sell ice cream). We got the maple chunk. It is sweet. The chunks are in fat sugar only. The exhit downstairs is good to learn more about the maple syrup and kill time."}
{"text":"Was strolling along Old Montreal and ran into this quaint little shop selling maple syrup in all varieties. The sales associate was super friendly and offered us numerous samples of syrups, spreads, and jellies. He was knowledgeable about the different types of maple and how best to use all their products. Before I left, I had to also try their Maple Delight ice cream, loaded with chucks of maple sugar in each bite! Ended up leaving the place wishing I had tried their donuts covered in maple though!"}
{"text":"i freaking love this place.. they have plenty of samples... and plenty of maple stuff.. my fiancee and i shared a maple ice cream as well as a couple cookies.. we also bought a box of maple chunks since that's something we could carry on the plane..  i also had a cappuccino which was sprinkled with maple sugar   overall.. this is a tourist place but you got to check it out"}
{"text":"I really liked my mini blossom cream cupcake, and my boo like the oatmeal coconut cookie here.  They also sold some maple coffee.  Overall, cute store to get some maple sweets!"}
{"text":"We made daily stops to this place, especially in the mornings for Iced Maple Lattes. I will admit, I didn't taste the maple in my latte but that was play because the baked goods made up for it. Definitely try the cookies and the macaroons. The taste will leave you asking for more."}
{"text":"had their maple green tea, maple black tea and iced maple syrup on montreal high lights festival"}
{"text":"Delicious treats for you to snack now and take home to share with your friends and family.  Delicious popcorn and cookies just to name a few items. Maple cream cookies and sriracha maple flavored popcorn. Make your own maple taffy candy pop on ice. Great looking ice cream and gelato. They have free samples of pretty much every item in the store for you to try.  Great prices and a friendly staff makes shopping here a fun and tasty experience."}
{"text":"I happened to stumble into this Café by accident.  I love maple so I was immediately excited once I went in.  There were free samples right by the door of a maple drink which were very tasty. I ended up getting the maple taffy poured over ice and then rolled into a lollipop.  Not only was this a delicious treat, but it was also a very fun experience!  There was an extensive variety of maple-flavoured products I had never even thought of."}
{"text":"Maple ice cream, sweetened with Maple sugar.  My entire family love it.  Maple chunks flavor is the best!"}
{"text":"Super nice service, we bought several items (but accidentally left them in a cafe, so I cannot comment on the quality, but the other items we tasted were delicious).  We also had a simple macchiato with a shot of maple, and then had a stick of maple candy (made on the ice plate located in the store!)  It's certainly a touristy place but still well worth the visit, especially for those searching for more interesting souvenirs/gifts."}
{"text":"They let you try everything!!!  This place is the best for unique souvenirs and gifts!!!"}
{"text":"Such a cute shop especially if you've got a sweet tooth. Maple syrup sold here and it makes for excellent gifts. They produce the maple syrup in Quebec! Support local! This is what I would assum authentic maple syrup tastes like because all of the ones I sampled were all so rich in taste. I even ordered an iced cappuccino style drink with maple syrup and two ice-cream flavors of my choice, with an espresso shot. I am definitely coming back here next time I'm back in Montreal."}
{"text":"After wandering around Montreal for a day and half and commenting that most of the souvenier shops were duplicates of each other, we finally found this spot, specializing in maple syrup food items!!   Maple pepper, maple coffee, maple spices, maple salad dressings....you name it, they've got it (except maple hot sauce which we were looking for lol).  They had everything available to try which was nice and in the end I ended up getting some coffee for my parents, and some maple vinegar pearls for cooking which look and smell amazing!   A must stop when in Montreal!"}
{"text":"If you like maple syrup then this is the place to go. Maple gelato. Various Syrups, spreads and taffy all made of 100% maple syrup. Chocolate and maple. Nuts and maple. Brownies with maple. How much more Canadian can you get."}
{"text":"Only place you'll find tire d'erable (tire sur la neige) in Montreal.  Even if they make it with ice and not snow.  It was still really amazing, and only two bucks."}
{"text":"Listen, I know this is a tourist trap, I know that. But I would willingly walk into this trap again and again for the treasures found here. Do yourself a favor and have some of the maple chunk gelato. I'm lactose intolerant and it was worth it. They will let you sample anything, so sample everything. Your only regret will be skipping this place. Everything is made from organic maple syrup and it is as if Jesus himself descended upon this store and blessed everything that you will put in your mouth. Go. Do it. Embrace your inner Canadian."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of a giant tourist trap, this place features one of Canada's most prized exports, maple syrup themed everything.  It all looked yummy but we actually stopped in because the kids were craving gelato and this place looked like they were up to the task.  The strawberry sorbet was so creamy and light it tasted almost like gelato.  The bacio gelato was a perfect mix of chocolate and hazelnut.  Perhaps the best bite was the dark chocolate sorbet which tasted just like a high quality dark chocolate bar sans cream.  Reasonable prices (coming from someone from NYC) and a good bite.  Thumbs up."}
{"text":"This is a shop with many maple products. I loved the tastings and the free maple snow with purchase. We bought some maple syrup after being sold on the dark syrup during a tasting!"}
{"text":"the gelato is awesome! Finally find real gelato instead of those creamy ice cream with way too much sugar. The gelato is refreshing and light. The service is very good too!"}
{"text":"Need little shop with one common theme - Maple Syrup. My wife and I stopped in here on the first day of our trip to Montreal (read: before I became aware of Canadians deep love of all things maple syrup). We were warmly greeted by Charlie, a very friendly employee who gave us a quick lay of the land, and offered to assist is sampling any of there products. My wife made a b-line for the little cafe area in the back where she ordered a Maple Latte. She said the maple flavor came through clearly. The had some dessert stuff in the back too but the majority of the store was maple candies and infused products, all very neat."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped by for some souvenir shopping and bought a ton of goodies. The associate originally from Boston was super nice and gave us a maple syrup tasting. The customer service was great. We left the shop realizing that we were missing two items in our bag and went back to get them. They were super nice about it and apologized for missing the two tiny items that they forgot to put in the bag. And the associate gave us extra candies!"}
{"text":"I don't really care much for maple, but I'm a sucker in trying new things specially plant base. There was maple items all over the shops in this area, this store had the most offering. They also had a section where they allowed you to sample many different variety. On the ground floor there is a small seating area, and a mini museum on maple downstairs where they have more seating. I purchased a maple muffin from them, it tasted like it had been marinated in maple syrup. The servers were very friendly and knowledgable on their products."}
{"text":"touristy i know but they are so nice here and have a million maple products. knocked out quite a few gifts to bring home to the parents. free sample of maple taffy."}
{"text":"If you like maple this is your place located in Old Montreal this place has everything maple from candies to cookies to syrup to ice cream and gelato it has it all the staff is evtremely helpful they will let you sample anything you want will also explain what each item is and how its made  plus everything is fresh if you like anything maple don't miss this place"}
{"text":"My friend took me here for their ice cream. I love the whole store smells like maple. How sweet it is. There was a line when we got in the store. We waited a little bit to order. I was happy that they let us sample the flavors. We picked pistachio and maple delight in a waffle cone. I did tried maple leaf cookie but it was too sweet for me. Both the flavor we got were tasty but my fav was the waffle cone. It is crispy and the flavor was good. I was so surprised when I had the first bite of it. It would be a good place to get souvenir or rest to have some ice cream."}
{"text":"Great place for everything maple and for great ice cream! I bought the mixed berry ice cream and it was probably one of the best mixed berry flavors I've had yet! Great location in the middle of old Montreal! I would definitely come back for more in the future."}
{"text":"Maple overload.  Very helpful staff, gave out some samples explaining the differences between maples flavors depending on when they're collected.  There's a small \"museum\" downstairs if you're interested in more maple related facts. We got the maple gelato and maple grand marnier cappuccino.  The gelato wasn't all that but the cappuccino hit the spot after a day of walking around old Montreal."}
{"text":"If you'd like to pick up an edible souvenir, this is the place to stop by before you hop on your flight. It's much smaller than the flagship store on Rue St. Paul, but they had fresh coffee, pastries, even gelato, which I skipped since it's still cold outside. I highly recommend trying the three kinds of maple syrup that they have (amber, medium, dark) and also the one with Grand Marnier, which adds a hint of the orange liqueur. There's maple jelly, and a maple spread aka butter, that you can put on toast.  They also have products made from cranberry and honey, so taste away and find your faves! If you pick up a coffee, I highly recommend adding the maple sugar that they have available with a splash of cream. It beats Tim Horton's double double any day."}
{"text":"I you like maple, you have to come here.  I don't think there is a maple product they don't carry!  They offer maple syrup/maple product tastings which was simply delicious and a great way to let you sample the various things they sell.  Of all the things we bought here, the maple butter is among my favorite.  I will be seriously sad once my jar is empty.  The maple chunks and sugar are a hit too.  I made cookies with both once we got home and the maple flavor in them is just delicious.  The chunks add a nice texture on top of pancakes and toast too.  Their maple latte was also so good that we had to come back 3 times during our vacation to enjoy one."}
{"text":"Wonderful desert place, had their maple cookies and they were divine. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a whim and was more than pleasantly surprised. First off the staff is incredible!  They have tasting tables to try their many products (none of which I didn't like), gelato, coffees, and teas. I highly recommend the cranberry honey iced tea. It was so refreshing on a warm day. Also, do yourself a favor and get the gelato on the brioche bun.  It's the BEST ice cream sandwich you'll ever have!!"}
{"text":"This maple-syrup-themed sweets shop located in the touristy part of Vieux-Montréal is a fun stop for pastries and gelato.  In addition to ready-to-eat treats and ready-to-drink hot drinks, the shop also sells maple syrup and maple syrup accessories of many kinds. The employees are very friendly and will explain the many different items to you - and also sometimes give samples!  I just got some gelato, which was so-so. Perhaps next time I'd try a cookie instead. Despite this, the overall experience was fun, and I'd recommend at least checking it out."}
{"text":"For gelato, I wouldn't recommend it. It seems like more of a place for maple type products for cooking, gifts and sweets. It's in the heart of Old Montreal so there's a lot of buzz and tourism all around."}
{"text":"Great store for maple sugar related foods. Great gelato also. There are some tables too. Relaxed and comfortable atmosphere, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Maple heaven - unfortunately, didn't get anything maple so I can't speak to that.  Just had lattes and an americano - standard cafe fare."}
{"text":"Pourquoi c'est si bon cet endroit? Est-ce que c'est une attrape touriste? Oui mmaiiss! C'est vraiment bien, avec, manifestemment un inconditionnel amour des produits de l'Érable, cet endroit nous délivre la marchandise avec de très bonne crème glacée à l'Érable et autre. J'adore les produits de l'érable et j'ai été content pour moins de 3-4$ d'avoir un cornet en ce chaud Samedi, revenant d'une expo plutôt décevante du Centre des Sciences de Montréal. Les Délices de l'Érable est effectivement une attrape touriste avec son lot de cossins à l'érable que chaque touriste se plaie à manger et qui coûte un peu trop cher. Donc ce n'est pas parfait mais tout de même un endroit très bien qui selon ma théorie du vieux port de montréal, s'est grandement adapté aux locaux: Moins cher qu'avant avec de très bons choix moins attrape touriste.  I really like Délice des Érables as en Ensemble of great Maple product. I went there Saturday to get a very good maple and mapple butter ice cream cone for less than 3-4$. Pretty decent. Service is quick, the product are amazing and they do offer some non-maple ice cream. They also have great variety of maple sweet and viennoiseries. Pretty good place for the morning coffee and also a little bit of a tourist trap but just enough not to be annoyed by it as a local. Nice place to stop in a hot day as you'll be in the debt Old Port of Montreal without having to venture much far on the outside section of it."}
{"text":"This is a cute place full of delicious ice cream. They feature several maple flavors, and all are delicious. The staff is very knowledgeable of products, which I appreciate. I didn't believe their recommendation at first, and I insisted on tasting a few, but they were indeed right about their best maple flavored ice cream. They have strong wifi. The space is very clean with delightful decor. A great place to stop when you find yourself in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"Boutique super sympa où on trouve tout fait avec du sirop d'érable! C'est un bon endroit pour rapporter des cadeaux et goûter des trucs nouveaux qu'on ne trouve pas ailleurs (ou en dehors du Canada au moins!)   Ils ont des tables dans la boutique où vous pouvez goûter à presque tout! Les beurres de sirop d'érable, le caramel au sirop d'érable, les confitures, des sauces en tout genre!   Aussi, mais je n'y ai pas goûté, il y a un coin avec des copeaux de glace dans un bassinet où les gens au comptoir déverse du sirop d'érable, puis ils laisse la substance visqueuse se solidifier et ça se transforme en sucette sur bâton. Plutôt cool!!   C'est un peu cher quand même, mais il y a beaucoup de choix bio, puis ça fait vraiment des cadeaux originaux à rapporter!"}
{"text":"Stumbled onto this place on our first day, a bit tired with the rain, when I saw the macaroons in the window.  Tried a bit of this and that and became a true junky!  There are chocolate filled crusty pastries that are to die for.  Didn't figure out until later that everything has maple.  We were only in Montreal a few days but came back and ordered more.  The gelato and macaroons are good but go for the square \"shell\" pastry filled with gooey chocolate if you want something really good.  SO and I want to take another trip to Montreal if only to come back here and eat some more.  Perhaps its a Quebecer plot to make us Americans more obese than we already are, but I'll take my chances.  So darn good!"}
{"text":"Great stop for maple syrup souvenirs from Montreal. You can find some cool maple syrup products for a reasonable price in any shape and form.   You can also try out some of their products at the tasting stations in front and near the register.   The gelato was good as well. However, the popcorn variety was just alright. The Sriracha flavor didn't taste spicy at all. I was expecting some kick, but no."}
{"text":"I stopped in to get some gelato, but I left with much more! After tasting almost every maple delight they had I finally decided on getting some maple spread and maple caramel. I also had a scoop of the maple brownie and a scoop of the raspberry sorbet! SO GOOD!!!!! There were probably 6 or 7 sorbets for any of the vegan folks out there.  Overall amazing maple products, incredible gelato, and fantastic employees!"}
{"text":"Really great gelato. I went there a couple of times during a trip to Montreal. It was the perfect treat on a hot day. Everything is sweetened with maple syrup and you can even try maple syrup tastings at the store. Pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Another short impromptu stop as my mother and aunt sought gifts for friends at home would take us to Les Délices de l'Érable and with myself largely underwhelmed by the selections they found what they were looking for in a variety of maple candies and confections - the candies largely maple sugar shaped like maple leaves and the rest of the items largely forgettable save for a Maple Sable that was so bland and poorly made that it stuck out like a sore thumb for its mediocrity and stick of frozen maple sugar that was actually quite good - a sort of \"Sugar Daddy\" meets popsicle of maple syrup.  All things being equal this is a spot to grab souvenirs for friends and maybe a bottle of maple syrup you could get cheaper elsewhere while wandering Old Montreal but it is certainly not a destination or must visit in a city with so much better to offer."}
{"text":"This place was so good we were here like everyday of our vacation. I loved the macarons....orange blossom :). But yea everything here is yummy and should be a major pit stop on anyone's vacation here."}
{"text":"Omg lots of sampling here! We had pistachio and maple/Nutella favor ice creams and maple dried cranberry here"}
{"text":"Cool place with overpriced maple products. We just had maple ice coffees- very good, maple tea, also very good, and a couple of baked goods- flavorless. I would have given it 3 stars but the baked goods were really lousy."}
{"text":"I'm really glad I stopped here before I left Montreal! The maple leaf cookies were excellent and all my friends love them!! Super helpful staff even if they are busy!"}
{"text":"Great vegan sorbet. The maple with almond milk was unreal. Awesome concept with so many different types of maple varieties. Also vegan friendly. The tasting was the best."}
{"text":"Dans ma tête, j'ai toujours perçu se magasin comme étant un trappe touristique. Ayant grandi avec du sirop d'érable comme un condiment de base, j'avais l'impression que c'était un peu un moyen de faire payer les visiteurs un peu trop cher pour des produits à l'érable. Tout ça a changé quand j'y suis allée pour la crème glacée à l'érable. Et le latte à l'érable aussi. Mmm...mmm...mmm! Ils ont aussi des produits de beauté à l'érable qui ont l'air intéressant mais j'ai peur de les manger si je m'en achète! Petit trucs pour ceux qui cherchent une salle de bain publique. Il y en a au sous-sol où vous devriez aussi prendre le temps de jeter un coup d'il au Musée de l'érable. Oui, oui! Il y a un musée dans cette boutique!"}
{"text":"This place is the best! It made me a true maple believer. The staff is super friendly, enthusiastic and knowledgeable in everything maple. As a newbie I was able to try different types of maple syrups sold in their store. Through the taste test I discovered my new favourite thing - grand marnier maple syrup! I recommend any one visiting Montreal to check this place out. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Their ice creams with maple flavor is to die for :) I also bought a maple syrup (packed in a maple leaf bottle :) ) but yet to try it!"}
{"text":"How can you NOT like a shop that specializes in Maple Syrup delicacies. You name it they have it. Maple Syrup taffy to pour on ice to harden then roll around a stick to eat, yummy. Or pour it over ice cream like I do, even better. Maple Syrup flavored coffee and teas, yup they have that. Maple Syrup coated popcorn, check. Maple Syrup with Grand Marnier, that's here too, pour it over strawberries, amazing. All sorts of Maple Syrup candies too. Most if not all of their products are available to taste before you buy. If all the Maple Syrup products are not enough for you, they also sell gelato. Enjoy your natural sugar high!"}
{"text":"So many free maple samples! This was a really fun place to visit. Everything was delicious, the staff was very friendly, and the museum downstairs was neat and educational."}
{"text":"Obviously VERY touristy, smack-dab in the middle of Vieux Montreal, but we loved our big, sticky, decadent croissants (maple-almond and chocolate, if I recall correctly.) They had so many maple-flavored pastries and sweets on display -- want to go back and try them all!"}
{"text":"I dropped by quickly in the middle of my photoshoot, since it seemed like a really cute place.   The front of the store is filled with maple goodies! The staff was very kind and I saw a lot of them helping other customers pick out good presents/snacks.   One staff member directed me to the back of the store, because I wanted gelato. I was expecting the usual flavours (chocolate, vanilla, rocky road, maybe bubble gum), but to be honest, I barely looked at those. What caught my eye were the specialty gelato (dulce de leche, s'mores, maple pecan, etc). It was so hard to choose! Again, the staff helped and told us what was popular, what they liked and even gave us samples of the ones we wanted.   We ended up getting maple pecan in a cone, since it's maple and we were at a maple store. It was delicious! It cost about 5$ after tip.    We sat outside in front of their store to eat. It was melting fast, but we just ate faster!   I'm definitely considering going back to get a taste of the rest of their ice creams!"}
{"text":"Such a great little cupcake and ice cream spot in the heart of Old Quebec.  Located right alongside the gorgeous Notre Dame (to the left precisely if you are facing the basilica) makes for a great spot to stop in for a quick treat.  The cupcakes are delicious and they provide a great variety of flavors.  A good amount of options for ice cream as well.  Can't decide whether to do ice cream or cupcake??  Really, just have both, they're totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Stumbled into this cafe by accident, and it has been one of the best parts of Old Montreal so far! They have all kinds of maple product samples (spreads, vinegar, syrups) as well as a cafe and gelato shop inside. Definitely stop by for the vibe and to see all the maple products."}
{"text":"Gellato is much better than their macaroons Great place to stop when you are walking in Old Montreal"}
{"text":"Bonne boutique de produits d'érable  Pas trop cher dépendant de quel produit  Service impeccable  personnelles gentil  Que ça sois thé café et même produits du terroir plein de bonne chose à bon prix sois en cadeau ou pour sois même"}
