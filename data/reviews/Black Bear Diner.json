{"text":"Second time at this location and it was horrible. I work in the restaurant industry so it usually takes a lot of wrongs for me to think service sucks. Upon arrival not more than 10 tables in the entire restaurant and got sat promptly. After 4 minutes of server (Tara) not even stopping by to greet us, I asked the first person who walked by (happen to be the manager) if we could get a server to offer us drinks. He took our drink order and she finally rolled up right before he delivered the drinks. We were ready to order so she took our order and for as slow as it was it took 26 minutes for our food to come out. She asked if we needed anything and we said no, but after a few bites into our meal we noticed my son didn't have all the condiments that came with his fajita dish so we waited a bit, then looked around and saw one server tending to her tables and our server nowhere to be found. I asked the other server in passing if she could get our server but instead she offered to get the missing condiments. As always server came by just a little to late. After finishing our meal I was looking around at an even slower restaurant with fewer tables and our server nowhere to be found again. Went up to the cashier, paid the bill and of course as we were leaving here came the server always a minute behind. Not sure if she was doing side work, eating, taking a break or just hiding but it's sad that every time I looked around the restaurant she was almost nowhere to be seen. I guess my problem is if you're that slow there's no excuse for poor service which is exactly what I felt I received. 
To be honest this location is 3 minutes from my house, but I'd rather drive further to the Tropicana location for better service and food."}
{"text":"Great food and generous portions. This place is a must if you have guest visiting from out of town and you want to get some great breakfast food.  My old boss recommended this place and we are glad he did. It gets busy on Sundays. Way better than any IHOP or Waffle House. We left happy and full;)"}
{"text":"Huge breakfast, really creamy, tasty waffle & pancakes! We could have fed another person with all the food served, we will be back!"}
{"text":"It's rare that I take the time to write a review, much less a negative one; but I could not allow such a horrible dining experience to go unreported. I, much like many others, look to online reviews when making the decision to visit an establishment for the first time. This has been a pretty reliable practice until now. The negative comments were few, but I definitely should have taken heed to them even though they were drowned out by the many positive reviews. I only wish that my family's experience were even the slightest bit similar to those that felt compelled to sing this restaurant's praises. Perhaps your personal experience is dependent upon the cook and wait staff on duty at the time of your visit... In any event, as a first time patron to the Black Bear Diner on Tropicana, I will never return. Upon entering the restaurant, we were seated immediately, that's where the positives end. Shortly after ordering our drinks, a very persistent fly or two buzzing around our table and our shooing them away seemed to go unnoticed by staff; this was my first opportunity to cut our loses and leave. Instead and regrettably, I ordered the Grizz breakfast, and my wife and youngest son the Spaghetti & Meatballs. In short, they were flavorless, cold and disgusting. My other son and daughter ordered the Western BBQ burger and Chicken Strips, fortunately theirs although nothing to write home about, were edible. The spaghetti and Grizz on the other hand were irritatingly horrible. The spaghetti looked and tasted as if someone poured ketchup over 4-day-old pasta and 2 day old, half-hazardly formed meatballs. Regarding the Grizz, the eggs were cold, flavorless and watery, which its still a mystery how someone can cook watery eggs; the meats were cold and salty and the hash browns were cold, undercooked and flavorless. The Pancakes were edible, until a fly landed on the plate.  I called the manager (Don) over shortly after receiving our food and he seemed utterly shocked that we were not happy with our order, stating, \"we are one of the highest rated restaurants in the city\". I found his defensive statement odd and completely detached from the fact that there were major issues with our order. He did however; eventually express his apologies and a desire to make things right by having something else prepared. Unless there was another cook to prepare it, I had no faith that it would be any different from our first order and declined. The waitress (Chrissy) came over to our table as the manager was there and asked if we needed anything. The manager mentioned to her that we were not happy with our meal and she gave us a look that made no effort to hide her irritation and walked away... That and the fact that the manager made no comment about her disrespectful actions was unbelievable and topped off what was already a horrible experience! The manager adjusted our bill; we paid and left completely feeling as if we just walked out of an episode of the twilight zone. I will never return, and to those that read this review and still take a chance with the Black Bear Diner on Tropicana, good luck"}
{"text":"Just started coming hear this year, and wow that Breakfast is amazing especially there potatoes. One of the best Breakfast places in town I must say!"}
{"text":"The food is great that is the only reason for my 1 star

However to the POS manager DON YOU HAVE SOME NERVE!!
1st off hire more staffing if you know that you are hurting with the wait time and service. (Common sense)

We waited 20 mins to be seated not bad but then 45 mins to an hour more just to get our food!!! You were arrogant and rude you yelled at your poor waitress who was trying so desperately to accommodate to her full area. Everyone was upset! You them tell me nd other customers that our meal would be comped which it wasnt. Now the thing that truly upset me was our poor waitress was so upset she was crying. She was  apologizing for the service since the other waitresses were grabbing her food and she couldn't provide the service she wanted....never ever put down your staff in front of clients!!!

Horrible service not because of the waitress but because of management!!!! 

Fire DON hire someone that knows what he is doing, maybe then he can stop comping out meals!!!!!! And make it enjoyable!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a great place for a family Breakfast. The atmosphere is down home with carved bears and a lodge look to it. We were seated quickly and the service was great with a friendly waitress.I had the California Omelet and it was ver good and fresh tasting with the avocado on top. My Grandaughter Had the Chicken fried steak and loved it and the portions are large. The prices are very reasonable and I will be definitely going back."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place is rated so low. Other than the wait I couldn't ask for more in a breakfast joint. Their chicken fried steak is the size of Texas and really isn't that expensive. I could also eat their biscuits and gravy all day. To me, all breakfast food is pretty much the same but this place is like Denny's on steroids."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their breakfast is so good and you get a large amount for the price you pay! Definitely gets a little busy during morning hours and weekends, but its worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Excellent diner that serves breakfast lunch and dinner! We were there for breakfast and it was all exceptional! Their hotcakes were utterly amazing, they tasted like cake. The omelette was also spectacular."}
{"text":"Black bear is one of my favorite places in the valley to eat.  It's diner, comfort food at it's finest.

This go around we went for a late breakfast.  Had to wait about 15 minutes (Sunday around 1130AM), but it was no biggie.  

We ordered from the lighter fare section of the menu and got a Small Volcano (around $7-8) and a basic egg, sausage patty, hashbrowns, and biscuit (about $6-7).  The small volcano came with 1 sausage (subbed for bacon, no problem), 1 bacon, 1 egg, and 3 pancakes (for $1 more I got the oat/nut pancakes).  I eat big, but still didn't finish the pancakes.  More than enough food.  Good, crispy bacon, simple scrambled egg, and some pretty tasty, hearty pancakes.  All was delicious, and we both hoped they'd come take our plates quickly so we'd stop picking at them.

Service was good.  Coffee kept coming, food came quickly, waitress knew all the answers.  Black Bear never disappoints.  Total was about $24 with tip, a tea, a coffee, and the 2 meals."}
{"text":"Reminded me of a typical denny's type diner nothing special. Left there wishing we didnt waste our money on low quality food. Staff was friendly, but the food is so bad it only deserves 1 star. Can't comprehend how it has 4 stars to begin with."}
{"text":"Food was very good.  Loved the fresh squeezed orange juice, portions were very generous.  My one issue is with the syrup.  They need to carry pure maple syrup, even if they need to charge for a little container."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! Great service!! Awesome food!! The place looks great!!! You cant do better!! Plain and simple review!"}
{"text":"Yum! The restaurant had awesome food! Traveling to Vegas can strain you and of course you have to find that perfect diner the morning after a night of crazy drunkeness. I used my trusty yelp app, and the Black Bear Diner popped up. I called ahead of time, I heard the place gets packed, and they said it would be a 15 min wait. They couldn't take my reservation over the phone though, :( but when we got there we did wait the full 15 mins, but it wasn't that bad. Our waitress was sooo busy in her section but she still managed to check on us when we needed, it's like she read our minds. I had the breakfast from their smaller portions section of the menu. I think it was called the volcano? I can't remember. Anyhoo, I couldn't finish! The small portions are big too! The fruit bowl I ordered on the side was sooo good too. I would definitely come back again! Thanks Black Bear Diner, see you next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Can't complain ... one gal looks like she hates her job but we were served by candy... candy was great, professional, personable, and super attentive considering how busy the place was. This restaurant is clean and the food was great and for a good price. I'm glad I came here. Thanks for the smiles guys!"}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner has always been one of my favorite restaurants. The price is very good for the food you receive. Very delicious food."}
{"text":"Delightful surprise off the Vegas Strip.  A bear themed diner with truly tasty bear sized servings!  
Leaving Las Vegas, our party of four wanted to grab quick, hearty breakfast before our road trip home.  Using Yelp, we came across the Black Bear Diner; all of us enjoyed the experience! 
We were greeted by friendly staff and seated quickly.  Our server was friendly and attentive.
Between us we tried pancakes, eggs benedict, an omelet and a traditional breakfast combo plate. None of us were disappointed in the least.  Each dish was generous, attractively presented and totally YUM. 
Tired of smoke filled casinos and long buffet lines, this was the perfect breakfast experience to end our Vegas trip and begin our road trip home.  Thanks Yelp, you didn't steer us wrong!"}
{"text":"When it is empty, and if you happen to get one of the good waitresses, it is okay. If you see people waiting outside, God help you. The food quality and service drops to horrible, and the wait is nightmarish. You will be better off cooking at home, or even the dodgy McDonalds next door. Oh and the restroom is a tiny booth, so hopefully you don't encounter a line or need to change a baby."}
{"text":"Excellent is absolutely great staff and the food over the top be ready to take some home with you!:)"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the pancakes here. The omelet was a decent serving size and the waitress was pleasant."}
{"text":"Our family went here for the first time this past Friday night. The fish fry was excellent and our waiter (Raymond) went above and beyond with service. looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Two and a half stars, if I could.
Water tasted tappy. Environment was quite loud. Price to portion ratio was decent but not impressive.

I ordered The Gobbler sandwich, which was good but not great and certainly not five star amazing. The fries came out a little bit lukewarm and the oil tasted weird, so I sent them back in trade for some mashed potatoes which were slightly overcooked but otherwise nice.

My co-diner ordered chicken fried steak, and in her own words \"wolfed it down.\" Came with aforementioned slightly overcooked mashed potatoes, some very overcooked mushy green beans, a corn bread muffin that was alright I guess, and a garden salad that was fine and came with a surprisingly tasty ranch dressing.

We got a free bearclaw from a coupon we'd found on the internet. Super mediocre, and I'd have been very unhappy to buy it at any price. I'm used to the baked-fresh-daily bearclaws from Panera, but this thing came out cold, solid, and covered in clingwrap.
\"It's... not fresh. It's maybe three days old. It's a puff pastry, but it's very dry. If you bite into it, it explodes all over.\"

Overall we've had better experiences from our local Denny's."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here to Vegas on a whim cause we were looking for a place for breakfast away from the strip. This place did not dissapoint! It was sooo good, my boyfriend even said it was the BEST steak breakfast he's ever had!! I mean, for your American diner, that's pretty good. I absolutely love the service, she was very attentive and friendly and seemed to love her job. Plus, the peach ice tea is da bomb! Definitely going to always come here when we visit Vegas again :)"}
{"text":"Favorite place to grab a great breakfast and connect with friends. The ScramBOWL is amazing and their pancakes are the best!"}
{"text":"We landed in Las Vegas and were met by a friend who lives here. We were all hungry, and he suggested a diner that locals frequent, the Black Bear. I was hungry but didn't know what I wanted. One friend ordered breakfast with hash. The other a salad with chicken. I went with something different: steak sandwich with chimichuri sauce. It was delicious. The bread was soft, the meat was thinly sliced, and the sweet potato fries were the best I had ever had. My lunch was $11 and change. It was so filling I wasn't hungry for dinner. 
My friend wasn't a fan of the hash, it was shredded as opposed to chopped, bed she found it a little dry. The other friend had the taco salad with chicken, he said it was \" ok\".  I guess I hit the jackpot. My lunch was great. If you want a nice meal, away from the crowds, you might want to check this place out. My friend who lives here says the breakfasts are great."}
{"text":"Wrongfully delicious would describe the cinnamon roll French toast! Don't come here is you're trying to watch your beariliscious figure. Great biscuits and gravy with thick cut Bacon. Eggs were a little too greasy hence the four stars. Fantastic breakfast spot overall!!"}
{"text":"The food was good but I was dissapointed with the overall experience and clenliness of the entire place. The carpet in the dining area was and is unsatinary with stains all over the decore was interesting but dirty and im sure itd impossible to keep sanitary. 3 stars in generous."}
{"text":"STICK WITH EGGWORKS, EGG AND I, CRACKED EGG, or RISE AND SHINE, not this dump!  

The food here is flavorless and since Americans basically will eat anything with salt and sugar, it will be fine and reviewed well by most of them; HOWEVER, if you actually want flavor and service, go elsewhere.

Server didn't some back at all after delivering food to bring pancakes, coffee refill, napkins, etc. She only came back for the check claiming the kitchen is backed up, which is irrelevant when relating to service.

When I left, manager rung up bill and didn't even ask how everything was because he probably knew how terrible the complaints are in there due to flavorless food and lack of service.  I then told him that I am further dissatisfied as to why he didn't ask how my meal was, but he could care less since it is busy and this place is making money from people who don't know any better.   

HELLO!!! THE MAPLE SYRUP THEY SERVE WITH THEIR 'FANTASTIC PANCAKES' IS THE CHEAP ONE WHICH HAS \"HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP\" LISTED AS #1 OR #2 INGREDIENT, but most fatties just eat that up.  A normal person knows that there is only one ingredient in maple syrup, and that is MAPLE SYRUP.

Again, don't come here, go to the above mentioned places down the street."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now, all for lunch. 

I really wanted to like it, but it was not to be. Maybe the breakfast is awesome but the other stuff is not good. I've had a burger that was gigantic but fell apart as soon as I tried to pick it up. The patty was also missing the middle section. It looked like it came apart while cooking and they tried to hide it with tomatoes and lettuce.

Then I tried an open faced roast beef with mashed potatoes. The gravy had that slightly artificial taste. I assume it came out of a can or jar. The roast beef was made I don't know when but they tried to heat it up and just dried it out on a griddle. The potatoes were ok.

My final meal was a ribeye steak. It was the worst steak I've ever had. I asked for medium and got a dried piece of shoe leather. The best cut of steak was reduced to a dried up shoe that I could barely get a knife through. 

The one redeeming feature was the staff. Every time I was there, they were great."}
{"text":"Ever since we found one of these while visiting our property up in Reno, this is our \"go to\" place for weekend breakfasts. Although this is a franchise business, it never feels that way. The owner/manager is always by the front till, greeting the customers and welcoming them to the establishment. The portions are large without being obnoxious and the food is usually pretty good. We only come for breakfast, so we can't comment on their other meals.

The place is usually packed on Saturday and Sunday mornings, but don't let all the people standing around waiting scare you off. They turn tables rather quickly and the wait usually isn't more than 10 to 15 minutes. If you bring kids, there are plenty of stuffed bears and other bear related items that can keep them occupied while you wait. One word of advice--if you go on Sunday, try to get there before the local church services end. It seems like that this is the place people like to come after church and the wait can be up to 45 minutes.

Once seated, the service has always been top-notch. No matter how busy the place is, the servers always seem to have a smile on their face and make you feel like you're their most important customer. We've been coming here for years and it doesn't look like they have a lot of turnover in the front of house so the workers must enjoy the atmosphere. It's usually no more than a minute or two before you have your menu and the waitress is ready to take your drink order. Their coffee is good and we'd recommend their fresh squeezed orange juice. Unless you know exactly what you want for breakfast, the drinks will be there before you're done reading through the menu.

I mostly order one of their three egg omelets (the California or I'll choose my own ingredients). No problems with substitutions here. The omelets come with hash browns which have always been crispy on the outside and warm and moist on the inside. My only complaint would be that the hash browns are under seasoned, which could be good if you're on a low sodium diet. I'll include a side of their sausage links to add a bit of meat to my meal. The links have just the right amount of seasoning to have that sausage bite without being overpowering. They are large, fresh and juicy instead of the small, wrinkled ones that have been sitting under a heat lamp that you get in some of the larger chains. Their buttermilk pancakes are large and fluffy and have never been over or undercooked. If you don't think you can eat the full meal, try ordering from their \"Little Less\" menu. The omelets are made with two eggs instead of three and all the portions are a bit smaller.

The bad part about this place is that it's out west Tropicana which is a bit of a drive for us. We wish they'd open one somewhere in the northwest, although then we'd be eating here more than we probably should."}
{"text":"Came down on a sunday morning. It was pretty busy. Didnt wait too long to be seated. First time time here as well. I ordered what I think was called \"The Grizz\" ?...It was good not great. Kind of oily though. The special pancakes were awesome though. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars, I would! 

My fiancé and I have never been here before, we wanted to try something new, and I saw the billboards on the freeway. We decided, hey why not? 

We have a thing for hole in the wall diners, and this place totally passed our expectations. Awesome food and portions, awesome service, and all around just an awesome cool and different atmosphere. He music is great too!

Our server was David, he was amazing! He knew we hadn't been to Black Bear before and talked the food up, and gave us a little history about the chain as well! We could tell he totally loved working here, which we strongly admired about him. He knew everything about the menu, and was very proud of the food and they even have fresh squeezed orange juice! When we told him how much I loved ranch dressing, I asked for a small amount to go because I couldn't finish my meal. The ranch dressing, oh the ranch dressing! It has bits of real bacon in it, sooo good. He let us box up our food, and came around the corner with a tub of ranch for us! Lol it was so cool! 

They also have staff working here with disabilities, which warmed our hearts because the rest of the staff treated them with so much respect. And they did a fine job too! We even tipped the bus boy because he was super friendly, and told us that loved Black Bear Diner! Honey, we do too! 

Upon leaving we got the bill, and couldn't believe how inexpensive it was for our meals! We'll be having breakfast, lunch and dinner with our left overs! The portions are that big! 

When we left, the hostess at the front, her name was Audi- \"like the car\" as she said with a huge smile on her face! She was very sweet, and complimented my engagement ring, and my makeup, which I thought was very nice of her. She said she hoped to see us again soon, and we hope to see you too! 

Loved the staff here, they made our first time to Black Bear memorable. We will definitely be coming back!

I think we found our new spot, during our meal we even discussed bringing our friends and family here because man, it was that good! I can't wait to share this place with people! It's awesome, and if you want a cozy and comforting meal, this is the place for you! 

You HAVE to try Black Bear, they have a huge selection of food, and the decor is very different from your typical diner. Even though this place is new, the decor is dated and have this really cool country vintage vibe. It's definitely not hip or chic, but we really appreciated it, considering that we love these type of diners! 

Go here! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good service, big portions, good food. Friendly family restaurant.  Recommend restaurant to all food lovers.  Cost effective"}
{"text":"Love the food best breakfast ever wish I could say that about Bonnie b worst attitude ever rude bitch"}
{"text":"The service here was amazing, just a lovey group of hard working people. It's a great little spot. I will be back."}
{"text":"Food tasted good, service was slow. The worst thing was this: we were seated in a booth with a straight shot view into the kitchen. I saw a server rub her nose with her bare hand and then pick up a thing of butter and plates of food and served them! There were also several employees eating in the same area!"}
{"text":"Warning! If you suffer from Ursaphobia(fear of the bear) do not visit this restaurant. This is one of those themed based restaurants which gives reverence to the \"Black Bear\". They have bear carvings, 100s of stuffed bears, bear hot sauces, etc. I visit this restaurant often because they serve generous portions of freshly made food. I typically go here for breakfast, I have ventured out into the lunch portion of the menu only twice so my review is basically for breakfast. If you are tired of the other restaurants trying to sell you their orange juice as \"fresh squeezed \" then try this place. I hate when I restaurant tries to pass off orange juice from jugs delivered to their location as being freshly squeezed. That's just false advertisement. Black Bear has freshly squeezed orange juice which is made on the premises. The machine can be seen in the left corner as you walk in to the restaurant. 
I usually get the freshly made corned beef hash, hash browns and a biscuit with gravy. This place not only makes the corned beef hash fresh but also the hash browns are also freshly shredded . One of the few places in town that I'm aware of that makes their own hash browns. I have also tried the Joe's Hobo omelette a couple of times. 
For lunch I enjoyed the hot turkey dinner with mashed red potatoes and sauteed vegetables. The turkey is nicely sliced white meat with ample portions. I've never left this place hungry. 
The one day I would stay away from here is on Sunday. The regular manager was not here on a Sunday I dropped by here recently. I must say, the place was not very well run on his day off. The manager that day definitely seemed confused and overwhelmed. The other recommendation I would make is to try to stay in the main dining room. The only times I have had slow service was when I have been seated in the side room."}
{"text":"What a place! They have an extensive menu for food for anytime of the day. All items are available 24hrs a day except for the baked potato. We ate breakfast and I had the best granola pancakes i've ever had. The service is friendly and very helpful. I liked it that they had menu items for smaller appetites. I can't  wait  to go back for dinner."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with friends, I got the Black Berry Pie with Ice Cream for breakfast, yes for breakfast... IT WAS GOOD! Everyone elses food was good too it seemed. Nice place! No complaints."}
{"text":"As part of a tip through Phoenix a few weeks a go ended up in Goodyear and stopped here for dinner (was toss up with the Waffle House next door). Well, did the Chicken Fried Steak dinner (my favorite dinner everywhere) and have to say my plate was overflowing with steak, gravy, and potatoes. the potatoes were only so/so and eggs weren't exactly correct BUT the steak and gravy were really great. Too bad I could not finish it or take it with me (kind of hard whilst staying in a hotel). Wife had a sandwich which too was too big to finish. Service was OK but the coffee was real bad. Still, giving it a 4; Mileage mat vary one star either way."}
{"text":"Wow, talk about shitty service. 3 different visits, 3 different servers, all starting and ending with disappointing service. Could the server have just a little more personality, just be more frickin courteous? By the way, our server for today was Kelly. My wife's plate didn't even come with what they advertised. Plates shoved on our table without saying excuse me, just ignored us at one point, knowing we needed to ask her a question. We love the food here, that's why we keep coming, but I honestly can say this might be our last visit"}
{"text":"The food is excellent. A.bit pricey compared to some but no ripoff. Many competitors."}
{"text":"Very good food. 
We ordered chicken strips and fries, grilled cheese and onion rings, fried chicken with mashed potatoes (corn muffin and cream of broccoli soup), cheeseburger. 
Service was good and staff was friendly. 
Definitely recommed and come back."}
{"text":"I always passed by this restaurant I thought I outta try it out. The atmosphere was Definitely appealing, kid friendly and great portion size. Our meal was delicious and kids eat free on Tuesday. I highly recommend this place great breakfast restaurant."}
{"text":"I love the kitsch of this place! Bears bears everywhere! Black Bear Diners are usually found in small to medium sized towns, but for some reason this one is smack in the middle of urban sprawl. So not complaining though, because it means I don't have to drive to the middle of nowhere to enjoy their old-timey newspaper-menu and awesome pot roast! 

Their fare is strictly comfort food and always well-prepared. The full portions will fill an average 200lb guy, so it's nice that smaller folk like myself have the option of getting the small (or \"senior) portion! 

Save room for their personal-sized pies...you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Was excited there was no wait to get a table. Really nice atmosphere.  Good coffee and they have flavored creamers too.  Pretty good steak and egg special for Thanksgiving breakfast."}
{"text":"Met a few friends here after a fun Friday night. Working that hangover so I needed a little recovery fuel. 

Someone recommended Black Bear. I checked the reviews and it was not bad so I head over. 

It reminded me of a nice Dennys. Booths everywhere  (which is great) and had a specific \"chain restaurant\" feel going on. We slid into a booth and waited. 

The lady was kind and upbeat. Did the regular greeting and asked us a question or two. 

I ordered the chicken friend steak. It was one star better than Dennys. I suppose I mean it was not inspiring and it was pleasant. The gravy lacked real flavor and the eggs were cold. The potatos had good seasoning but the consistancy was wrong. 

Bottom line, I would come back if someone invited me to. I would not pick to come here over some of the other breakfast options we have sprinked around the city."}
{"text":"Wow what a disappointment the wait for service from beginning to end slow. Burger terrible wife's chicken dish bland just horrible overpriced garbage. Even paying the bill was a event. Cashiers talking to each other ignoring patrons paying their bill."}
{"text":"Big portions full of flavor. Peach cobbler was not as impressive. Would go again for sure."}
{"text":"This was the first time i had visited a Black Bear Diner. It will not be the last time.Friendly waitstaff ,generous portions and reasonable prices. It was very busy but the wait was not long.The decor ,of course, is black bear. I ended up taking 1/2 my sandwich home & also scored with a coconut cream pie  to go."}

{"text":"Today i had my first visit at Black Bear Diner.  I was very disappointed to say the least. As we got escorted to our booth the entire path to it was filthy. I could not believe all the trash laying on the f floor from sugar packets, lettuce, fries, and even miscellaneous debris of from who knows what.  Then i ordered water for my husband and i with lemon on the side. When we received it, it lemons were in our glasses which i wanted on the side. Later when she got our refills i asked for lemons on a separate plate.  I actually saw her grab the lemons with her bare hands. I never saw her wash them. I saw her collecting cash earlier for another table. How gross!  Needless to say i never used the lemons due to my disgust. I can't say I ate my meal with pleasure because of all the previous sightings.  I will not be returning here. Good luck to whoever goes here. You'll definitely need it!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times and I enjoy the food very much. The service is always on point. I love this new addition to the Laveen area."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely amazing for a breakfast joint. Pancakes are one of the best I have ever had and the portion sizes are enormous! However, I can't get over how dirty this place is! The restroom was as clean as a construction port-a-John. There was food all over the seat, floor, and curtains. My plate had finger prints all over the rim of the plate. The menus are cool because they are like a newspaper, but not cool when it is being reused with someone else grubby had prints and food all over it. Will I be back? Maybe. The food was so good that I want to come back but having a hard time getting over the cleanliness... Maybe in a few months they will have a new manager; fingers crossed..."}
{"text":"Went here for my first time today! Walked in on a Tuesday night, it was pretty dead and we were seated right away. Our waitress, Shanna was very friendly and was very attentive. The decor is unique, decked out with black bears and an old school juke box. The menu came in form of a newspaper which I kept as a souvenir. (: The portions of food was big enough to feed two! The comfort food is unlike any other other, it will definitely leave you full! For dessert, we ordered bread pudding which was heavenly! I wish I didn't live across town because I definitely want to go back again soon!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here five or six times now, and overall my experience has been that the dishes sound more interesting than they actually turn out to be. Maybe everything is under seasoned for my taste? The pancakes are okay but nothing special. The eggs and potatoes are fine. I've actually left bacon on my plate here - that NEVER happens! Yes, the portions are large, but I lose interest in the food before I'm full, to be honest. The staff is always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I went with a party of 6 and was a bit disappointed. French fries were overdone. The fish and chips were low quality, resembling fish sticks. The steak  sandwich was dry, meat overcooked, and the burgers were also dry. The service was very slow  our server knew they were out of coconut cream pies, but did not tell us until after we had ordered them. I specifically asked for no sauce on my burger, but yet I ended up with 2 different kinds of sauce. My brother, who ordered from the kids menu , wished for a refill of milk, and the server wanted to use the same plastic cup. There was not a lot of meat in the salads, and the coffee ok and they were out of tea bags for tea .They also nickel and dime you. However, it was quite homey."}
{"text":"I got the bear's choice, 2 pancakes, eggs, and sausage links!! The food is so good!! I love the pancakes!! Way better than other famous diners!!! Pancakes are so fluffy and soft, the syrup is not too sweet which is just right. The sausage links taste homemade!! My server, Anthony, was so kind!! Thank you Anthony!! I'll definitely come back here to try their other specialties."}
{"text":"My husband ordered an egg white omelete with chicken and veggie in it (we forgot the name of the dish), and I ordered the chicken fried steak with 2 eggs. My chicken fried steak was delicious and the best chicken fried steak I've ever had so far. Very very very good. And my husband liked his omelete too. We fell in love with this place after our first try. We also like the bears decoration inside and outside the restaurant, they are all very cute.
We wanna try some other items here in the future, and will order the chicken fried steak here again! Yay! Will keep coming!"}
{"text":"I was in Las Vegas on a busy event weekend running the Rock and Roll full and half marathon in December 2010. Being that our time share was off the main strip we wanted to find something close by and then return to get a good nights rest. After calling around almost every restaurant had more then an hour wait. We needed food and rest, no waiting as it was already late. As expected this was nothing special but our waitress was pleasant and offered suggestions tapered to what I was wanting to eat. The desserts looked out of this world delish but not on the list with a race the next day."}
{"text":"I've rejected my own judgements of Blackbear Diner and have determined that they have a legit breakfast offering.  (This review is based on breakfast only..no experience with lunch or dinner)

I've eaten at other Blackbear diners and likely judged them on the 'Merica clientele and oversized portions.   This time I went with an open mind and looked past the oversized portions by sharing a plate and couldn't see some of the diners because they were wearing deer hunting camouflage.  We also had a great, attentive server.  Pretty sure he was a \"bear\" himself, which made us feel more welcomed. 

We split the Bear's Choice with pancakes, eggs and bacon.  The bacon was thick and tasty and the pancakes were pretty hearty with a really great buttermilk flavor.  Splitting was the best, cause this plate was huge.  The coffee was a nice blend, too. 

The host staff was real chipper, I'm sure it's the grand opening enthusiasm, but I wish this place well and I'm sure we'll hit it up again."}
{"text":"Stopped here on Sunday after finding out a local crepe joint was closed on a Sunday.  
Didn't make sense but looking up reviews drew me to this place!  

You can tell they're good because of the huge crowds here!

They do breakfast right!  They're a bigger \"corporation\" with many locations in different states and yet still retain the quirky nuances of a family owned business.  Sweet!

It was the first time I've finished my stack of pancakes anywhere.  Usually I take a few bites of the pancakes because they're never spectacular anywhere; just average at best.  Here, they were crispy, fluffy, lightly sweet...  I want some more now!"}
{"text":"Our server Stephanie was amazing. Not only was the service good, but the food was amazing! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is aight.  Kinda over-rated for the hype.  We had a large party and went on Mother's Day- both absolute no-no's.  (Actually, any Sunday morning is a bad idea).

After the two hour wait and losing half our party, we were finally seated.  The portions are huge. The biscuits are saucer size, but the gravy was bland. As a sourdough fan, the toast was basically white bread.  

On the upside, my guy got the waffles which were yum and the hash browns were tasty bc they were more crispy than mushy.  Others had the ham plate which they said was a tasty, but a bit dry.  

All in all, I would definitely go back, but only if the wait is no more than 10 minutes."}
{"text":"The service was fast and the food was delicious. This restaurant really gives off that mom and pop breakfast joint, it's wonderful."}
{"text":"Just awesome good food, large portions and great service... Great job Christina. Great food chicken fried steak cooks!..."}
{"text":"I love the breakfast!! I am a complete breakfast fan! It is always delicious i can never finish it because they feed you so much! We also like to go to the diner on our lunch break but unfortunately sometimes we are leary becuase it can take a while, so we tend to worry about not having time to eat. But all in all the food is amazing! The staff is always great. Looking forward to breakfast soon :D"}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Best Rueben ever, nice and lean, great flavor!  Their salad dressings are homemade, try the ranch, it has bacon in it!  Save room for dessert, the chocolate cream pie is out of this world.  Be sure to ask for Cindy Ray, she is truly a delight, makes you feel at home and is the perfect example of superior service.  We will definitely be back!  You can tell customer service is their number one priority and it sets them apart from others.  Job well done Black Bear Diner!"}
{"text":"Portions made to feed a bear. Well maybe 2 of them. I got an omelette and It was good but nothing special"}
{"text":"Huge servings for $9-12.  Good food.  A little greasy but good."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  the five of us were all happy with our meals.  The service was average but very friendly.  The amount of food you get is huge.  I got the huevos rancheros and was very happy with my meal.  I would certainly go back again."}
{"text":"Big breakfast portions, lunch and dinner sizes seemed smaller. Great crew. Table was prerty wobbly for a new open."}
{"text":"We have been to 4 or 5 Black Bear Diners now. Each one is always a pleasant dining experience.  We know the menu and the quality does not vary from place to place. 

When we head into the big city, we always have the Black Bear Diner on our list of places for dinner on the way home."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant twice, the first was for breakfast, and was ok. The second was tonight for dinner. They switched our waitress mid meal and the orders were messed up. The young host Mike,was extremely helpful, but as soon as our\"2nd\" server realized we were unhappy, she boot scooted out of range and wore a huge chip on her shoulder. The food was only passably warm and unfortunately we won't be back."}
{"text":"The hubby and I have been coming here for years and ALWAYS get a great breakfast.  The servers are all very friendly & service is with a smile.  The food is amazing and tastes like something your grandma would make.  Love that the owner always is walking around checking on you.   

My only \"complaint\" is that there is so much good stuff to choose from that ordering for me sometimes takes longer than the actual cooking of my breakfast!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, my first time coming with my family and it's very family friendly ( meaning kids friendly) it's hard to find a warm welcoming family friendly diner in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"This place has the absolute breakfast food I've ever had. I go all the time but the cinnamon roll French toast I just ate pushed me to write this review. It was so doughy but crunchy from the caramelized cinnamon sugar, to die for. The staff is friendly, they all run around like worker bees to keep up with how busy it always is which is respectable. Go here!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service and low(for Las Vegas) prices.  I went for a late breakfast mid-week with my daughter and grandson . Generous portions and great variety of food. My grandson had the cinnamon roll frenchtoast-I stole a bite and it was yummy! My daughter had cheese and sausage omelet with hashbrowns and toast, she was very happy with it; and I had scrambled eggs with pancakes, also very good. I  will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Good food. Good customer service. Nothing like good old black bear really loved the Laughlin location"}
{"text":"It was very good. The food was exceptional. The service was great. We were in town for a car show, and they asked about it and cared. We had The Volcano, one of the omelettes, and this mushroom spinach thing. They were all very good. Also, the price for everything was fairly cheap for Vegas. Recommendation: on a budget, go; want good breakfast, go!"}
{"text":"I live close to the diner however it would still be worth the commute if I lived further. Always pleased with my meal and I had a pleasant server today as usual. My son had the mini grizz which is far from mini. And I had the biscuits and gravy. I did not grab the dessert but they are definitely worth a try! Thank you!"}
{"text":"The homemade corned beef hash was excellent.  We also enjoyed the granola pancakes, hash browns (shredded FRESH potatoes), biscuit and bottomless coffee.  We had a party of six and everyone left happy and content.  Looking forward to eating here again."}
{"text":"Had a very good breakfast here.  Food was good and service was excellent.  They have some big round tables that are great for larger groups/families.

The biscuit was huge and fluffy.  The coffee is better than most coffee places here in town.

The home potatoes had under-cooked pieces of potato and green pepper.  The gravy is not as good as home made but was tasty on the small but nicely tender chicken-fried steak.

To be honest, I still the like the Egg & I or Cracker Barrel better for breakfast but the breakfast at Black Bear Diner is still worthy of a visit."}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to the opening of a great restaurant.  After 10 or so visits, we have been disappointed.  The breakfasts are okay; the Italian sausage is very good.  Other than that, it seems like quantity exceeds quality in most dishes. Desserts look better than they taste.  Milkshakes are great sometimes, and other times they are too thin.  The diner is very busy, so it takes a while to get your food.  The lighting is very bright and the music is quite loud."}
{"text":"I think this place is actually improved in the last month and a half. It was very good when I first came here but now it's even better. They've got all the kinks out of it the menu is absolutely wonderful they have two new items. This black bear sandwich is just absolutely on the best sound as I've ever had everything on the menu I've tried several things are very good to the point of being absolutely excellent.The people operating the store including the waitstaff are absolutely wonderful very friendly and make sure you're well taken care of. I try to come here at least twice a week and I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner was excellent; the apple chicken sausage is amazing! Great service and big portions. This is our new #1 spot for breakfast."}
{"text":"By far the best diner in town that my family and I visited on our trip to Vegas.

Though it was busy, we were seated within 30 seconds at a booth.  The diner was very well air conditioned and not too hot.  We had a lovely waitress who was on her A game.  And the manager kept checking up on us while we ate. 

My mom wanted to buy some of their coffee cups and we were thankfully able to get some.  The employees were incredibly respectful and the food? Absolutely amazing.  I ordered the chicken fried steak with iced tea and it was delicious.

Would highly recommend going here.  Best service and great food.  Go go go!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast!  Good service!  We have eaten twice and both times we were full and happy when we left."}
{"text":"My buddy Will M recommended this place to me. This place is damn good. The atmosphere is awesome. I honestly didn't feel i was in Vegas. The whole time I felt I was out on a mini vacation lol the food is good!"}
{"text":"We did not have a very good experience here and I have no desire to give it another go. My 5 year old son had the day off school and I decided we should give the new diner a try. The service was awful. This is no exaggeration - it took 10 minutes to be greeted (I should have left then), drinks and ordering took another 10. Typically when I have my kids I ask that their food comes out whenever it's ready instead of waiting for the whole table. I made this request and was told that they would take care of it. My son ordered waffles from the kids menu and I ordered a burger and fries basket. The burger comes dry so I asked for BBQ sauce. 24 minutes later a get a dry burnt burger with no waffle or BBQ sauce in sight. I asked the runner who delivered the food for BBQ. Another 3 minutes pass and the waffle, the meal due out first, arrives. My son finished his waffle before I even received my sauce and could start eating, and he is by no means a fast eater. Throughout this whole experience we saw out server at the greet, when we ordered, once during the food wait when he asked if we wanted more water, and finally at the end of the meal when he delivered my first and only refill and the check at the same time. I give the diner 2 stars because he loved his waffle and wants to go back. I keep telling him to ask grandma because I like to actually eat my food when I go to a restaurant."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! This was my first time here. I loved my California omelette and my fiance enjoyed the chicken avocado club. Service was great! Good to know that they serve breakfast all day. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Fresh , staff has friendly genuine happiness and the customers are in a great mood ! Much better than the big casino sunday Buffett. It's a sit down and order from menu casual diner. Everyone returns as a friend! If your having a bad day, come  in and relax and get some comfort food with your cell phone turned off! My gym buds pile on the egg whites and fresh oatmeal !!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, Good stick to your ribs food. I have only visited for breakfast  and have always been pleased"}
{"text":"My favorite place for Sunday morning breakfast! The prices are great, the food is great (and you get a lot of it), and the service is great! The wait is usually around 20 minutes and the longest I have ever had to wait was 45 minutes, worth it!"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill recently.  The last two times I've had breakfast, I've been quite disappointed. The food was served on a cold plate, so the eggs and hashbrowns were barely warm.  The hashbrowns, which used to be a high point, were mushy.  I expect over-easy eggs to have whites that are a bit runny, but not grossly runny like the ones I received.  A clear indication of laziness or inattention in the kitchen was the breakfast meat (ham and patty sausage).  Both were cooked nicely on one side, but barely cooked on the other. The good side faced up, of course.  I have to drive out of my way to get here, so they have lost me as a customer."}
{"text":"One of the most disappointing dining experiences I've ever had. Actually, I can't even speak for the dining because I never made it that far. I have previously eaten at the St. George and southwest Vegas locations, where both the food and the service were great. I'm not sure what is going on with the new Green Valley location. I'm giving this place one star only because my friend and I were seated immediately and someone quickly took care of our drink order. It was all downhill from there. We both ordered the 2 egg meal with pancakes and bacon. We were still waiting over 25 minutes later and no one came over to check on us. There was mass confusion in the kitchen and the wait staff were running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Pretty sure another table mistakenly got our order and sent it back. We finally just got up and left. No one even noticed. Hopefully, management will get the service issues worked out, but we will not be back."}
{"text":"Yummy!!  Nice menu with A Little Less portions. Awesome club sandwich!!  And the  dressing---best we ever tasted!!'"}
{"text":"This is a good diner. They are known for the chicken fried steak, but their turkey pesto sandwich with the kettle chips is my favorite.  This place is solid."}
{"text":"Food, service, price... All great! We're going back today for another real breakfast with real coffee & real coffee mugs. Thanks for referring us here go to Amy from Sprouts Market."}
{"text":"We are regulars at the Black Bear Diner. Chicken fried steak, hot turkey sandwiches, burgers, fries, & a variety of other comfort foods are served. Marlene is our favorite food server. Marlene works evenings & always makes us feel welcomed. She is kind, considerate, & hard-working. Regardless of how busy she is, she makes you feel important."}
{"text":"Huge portions and can cure you from your long night of having too much fun.  The pastries have all been disappointing to me, but their country fried steak is awesome!  The granola pancakes are good, but one would probably be enough fiber for the week.  Haven't ever been starved enough to get the bigger meals."}
{"text":"I love to eat here. Never go away hungry great food and great portions. Only issue I had was with the takeout that they did not wait to put in so it came out right after my meal so it sat there the whole time I was eating."}
{"text":"First time there and it was good! I order there small portion of pot roast with mash potatoes and it was still a lot of food for a great price (12.99) comes with salad and corn bread as well. 
I am not a fan of corn bread so I didn't like it. My husband had full size BBQ ribs with fries and it was OK. Ribs were a little bland and fries got cold fast even though they where fresh when we got them and they weren't really seasoned. 
The service was good and everyone there checked on us even if they were not our waiter. 
Is nice dinner. Would definitely try it again next time for breakfast."}
{"text":"My family and I love coming here. We first enjoyed Black Bear in southern California and we excited to hear when this location opened near us. We have been several times for breakfast and have never been disappointed. 

The selection is great and the portions are plentiful. What's really amazing is the bacon. I have had bacon at other local breakfast spots and they don't come close to Black Bear. Its thick and flavorful. 

Whenever we have friends or family from out of town we always suggest bringing them here. Service has never been an issue. The wait staff is always friendly and helpful. 

I would strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"First (and last) time here! Nice to be known at your local restaurant but to be in line and have individuals known to the staff pulled and seated ahead is not appropriate. Service was fast and friendly however food was cold where next to plate. Quantity was good. Servers question on how was the food was rhetorical and had he not made it as a statement and as a question he would have had the same feedback."}
{"text":"I tried the two eggs, 2 large sausage homemade patties, hash browns, 2 full biscuits and gravy. The gravy had a little more pepper then I preferred but it was still tasty. The breakfast is on the high end, price wise.
I was charged $0.99 for the gravy on the biscuits without being told that there would be an additional charge for gravy. All in all the breakfast was okay but the experience was not what I would have expected for the price."}
{"text":"ok. i'm a fan of the food and decor, but if you're in a rush, this isn't the place for you. i've been here for breakfast a few times. the food is always very good with large portions. you are paying for those portions though. my chicken fried steak breakfast is $10.00 .  so if you're looking for a cheap diner, this isn't it.  you can get a breakfast buffet for this price at other places as well. anyway, the quality is good and it's loaded with cute country bear decor. however, it's always super slow to get our food. it's almost always very busy as well. there are breakfasts under $10.00. on average, probably $8 or so. they have a simple lunch menu of sandwiches and burgers. their dinner menu is VERY limited. they have a steak, chicken, and ribs dinner. they are all $15.00. thats about it. so, good on quality. good on portions. a little higher in price. bad if you are looking for something quick. give yourself atleast 1 hour after you sit down."}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times and gotten different menu items each time. I think the food is pretty good. The silverware is cheap and light, but that could be fixed by bringing my own. :)"}
{"text":"I just spent 10 mins. at the front register ordering a simple tri-tip sandwich with 2 types of cheese extra mayo and cold.  The cost of the sandwich was slightly more than $14.00.  I just sat down to eat my lunch as I worked and the sandwich is wrong and I just find this such a frustrating situation.  One cheese, not the two I was charged for.  Mustard heavy mayo light. 
I couldn't locate a local phone number so I called one of the other 3 and was told they couldn't give me the number but I could locate it online.  I explained I had just attempted to find it on the Internet and couldn't find the number.  Still referred to online.

$14.00 sandwiches need to be correct.  This is my second bad experience at a Las Vegas Black Bear.  Expansion is great but your service level should not suffer.  Too bad they haven't learned this lesson."}
{"text":"I have eaten here and many other black bear diner locations, and have always enjoyed my meal. This is the first time that my credit card was charged more than it was approved for. I hope this is not a 'norm' for the Las Vegas location."}
{"text":"Decor is cute, interior was clean. Prices were typical. The food was lacking so I was disappointed. Had really hoped it would be good since we live close but it was just....eh. My sons steak was an odd color, kinda looked like a piece of pork chop. I had eggs, red potatoes and rye toast....the potatoes were undercooked and the toast did not resemble or taste like rye. My youngest had the mini volcano (eggs, pancakes and sausage) which he liked. The manager did send over a dessert when we shared our opinions. But all in all....Denny's is better...and that's saying a lot."}
{"text":"Waited several minutes for someone to notice our group of 7 waiting to be seated. No hostess or wait staff to be seen, and the restaurant was not busy. One person from our group had to go get someone from the back of the restaurant and ask if we seat ourselves, and then the hostess finally came and sat us down. Took awhile to get our order to be taken. Several people in our group ordered breakfast dishes and those seemed to be the way to go. The burgers were okay, one bacon burger had what was like bacon bits sprinkled on it, not actual bacon slices. The service was mediocre. They are generous in their helpings of carbs- tons of fries, hash browns, huge biscuits."}
{"text":"This is a great place for regular old diner food. Reminds me of a place you would stop at on the road... log cabin like and rustically decorated. The selection is typical diner food, sandwiches, breakfast, burgers and home-style meals like chicken fried steak and pot pie, with a few big salads thrown in for good measure. Prices are reasonable and service friendly and fast. Went with a group and they were very accommodating, and did not mind that we sat around, AND gave us separate checks with a smile."}
{"text":"Great prices with amazing portions! My son and I came here for lunch today some of the best food in the entire city of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My first experience at Black Bear Diner was okay. My husband and I came on a Sunday morning. Everyone seemed nice. We were seated and our waitress was Trina. She was okay, she didn't seem happy, just okay. She recommended a few things that she liked. We ordered and waited about 10-15 minutes for our food. I had the Juevos Rancheros, which I did not like the taste of the meat. Not the best I've had. My husband had the Chorizo burrito which he says was good. We were eating our food and not even 5 minutes into eating, Trina asked if we were interested in a bear claw or some other dessert. We declined and she gave us our check and told us we could pay at the front. We weren't even half way done with our food yet. She never gave us refills on our drinks, so that was a bit irritating. At check out, you walk to the front before you leave to pay. We were getting ready to pay when another waitress came up to the hostesses and said \"who took the tips off my table?\" And she was upset. It was awkward. Then she left and the 3 hostesses started talking bad about her. I payed and left. And I left feeling somewhat disappointed because I heard this place was great.

My second visit, we came for my sisters birthday breakfast. There were 9 of us and our waiter was John. John was by far the best waiter I've ever had. He had a great personality. He was funny and kept everyone at the table entertained while still helping out with our orders and anything we needed. He was constantly walking by and always had a funny comment to say. My food this time was great. I had the California Omelet which was delicious. Everyone pretty much enjoyed their food. This visit changed my mind on what I think about Black Bear Diner. Thanks, John!"}
{"text":"One of the only chain breakfast places that I like to eat at. They also serve lunch and dinner but I cannot attest to their quality as I only care about breakfast. Do not come here if your just looking for a quick breakfast as their service tends to be consistently slow. If you manage to slip in when they are not busy the service speeds up but that is not usually the case. 

As far as the food is concerned I usually leave full and happy. The quality of food is good and I enjoy that their hashbrowns and potatoes are not pre-frozen and are all prepared there to order. So far all the food I have tried I enjoyed.

I wanted to give 4 stars but the last two times that I have gone the service has been less than stellar with a really unorganized front of house. The host who seats does not pay attention to which groups come in first and seats them randomly which gets annoying when you have been waiting about 5-10 min just to be greeted."}
{"text":"Great food! Friendly services and huge portions!! Love the steak and eggs! Bear claws and all the pies!"}
{"text":"went on Sunday night at 730pm. we were greeted right away by 2 young ladies. We were at a table in 5 min. Staff was great, super friendly."}
{"text":"Wow! The best food in Vegas! Skip the crappy low quality Hotel/Casino food and enjoy the OUTSTANDING home cooking! The service is also most Excellent!  Overall value for your money is Superb"}
{"text":"Not impressed. The food was ok..The service was good. Good menu choices, but won't be returning. I didn't like this location either. I was expecting tastier food for the prices. Portions are not as big as they make it sound. I ordered the chicken  tender basket, 2 pancakes and 1 chocolate pie. My total came to almost $30. Definitely not worth it. I've had much better meals for less."}
{"text":"Went in on a Saturday night at 7pm. Did not have to wait for our table.  Was sat down by the manager and he took our drink order. Shortly after our waitress took our meal order. Took a bit for our shake to be made but it was tasty. When our meal arrived, they had taken it upon themselves to add cheese to the top of my spaghetti instead of asking if I would like any or how much. Once I took a bite into my food, I noticed the lack of sauce and how dry the meatballs were. Not tasty at all. The staff also left our refilled cups on our table our whole meal. Something we've noticed was how unorganized the staff were at finding their tables. They were asking each other who ordered what food and where it went. 

A waitress did notice I looked unhappy with my food and offered to get me a free burger & fries. I believe it's called a \"Bob Burger\". When we got our receipt, they had also took my spaghetti off my ticket.

I do have to mention the Bob Burger was tasty, flavorful, juicy and filling. I loved every bite of it."}
{"text":"On our way back to California.  Tried Black Bear Diner in Emeryville last months. Same great and friendly service. Waffles pancakes and French toast were great!"}
{"text":"We love their warm atmosphere.  We had two children under two and they squealed with delight at all the stuffed animals and when they got fussy our waitress got them balloons. The food was awesome  warm and delicious comfort foods. Thank you so much for a fun family dining!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place! Great breakfast! Great service! Feels like county livin!!"}
{"text":"Best pancakes they are very fluffy nice bacon and eggs very quiet very country great for dads and moms and black bear lovers"}
{"text":"Just ate here today to try it out, food was really, really good. I sat at the counter and did see how they were a little unorganized but it didn't affect me with my order or food but the cooks need to tighten it up a little. I would highly recommend eating here and have found a new favorite spot."}
{"text":"We went there for brunch(my fave meal of the day) and it was delicious!  We ordered the sweet cream pancakes and the monterey omelet.  I'm not an omelet person, more like a pancake person, but I loved the omelet.  Very tasty and worth the drive.  The pancake was good, but not out of this world.  Next time I am going to have to try the multi grain pancake....
The buscuit was delicious.  The service was great.  She split everything in 2 dishes for my sister and me, so it was really nice that she did that without us even asking to do so.  
Will def be back!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 10 on a Sunday afternoon and were seated in about 25 minutes just like Brenda said.
 Sarah, our server was great and fast. She kept our drink glasses full and made sure to get us anything we needed.

{"text":"This place is super packed on Saturday & Sunday mornings. Rain or shine. But the food is good & the staff give such great customer service that we always return. Wonderful atmosphere. Not to mention they have reserved up front motorcycle parking. Nothing like jumping on your hubby's motorcycle while the kids are at school to grab some yummy food & VIP parking."}
{"text":"Two and a half hours for breakfast. Ridiculous. The food is decent, but the service is very slow. Waited over an hour for a table, then more than 45 minutes for our food. I'm not sure we need to go back."}
{"text":"Best Food, Best Value, Best Service, Best Dining Experience! You are welcomed by the wonderful smell of whatever it is they have cooking up at the time that can only be described as comforting. The menu is probably the best and worst part of the place. When you start reading the descriptions of the different options you realize that you WILL be coming back just to try the other wonderful menu items. 

During breakfast they serve you whatever you like for breakfast (even if it isn't on the menu). For lunch they will serve you a burger that will shine next to any \"gourmet\" burger or any of the other lunch items or any of the breakfast items as well! Breakfast for lunch is a win every time! Dinner is great as well. During dinner time they serve you anything off the menu including breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 

The service is quick and friendly and always ready to fill up your drink. Also, if you are having trouble picking an item, just ask and you can trust the recommendation. 

PRO TIP: Don't eat your entire meal. Plan to eat 1/3, or maybe 1/2 if you are really hungry. Desserts are a MUST at this place. Also, plan to share the dessert or plan to take it home because there is no way you will be eating an entire meal and the entire dessert. Too much of a good thing is a most wonderful thing! 

I love this place."}
{"text":"Love this Place, Every time I Go here to eat, the food comes out hot, large portions, so you can take some home for later, and oh so yummy. My dad orders the famous Black Berry Pie, which they serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Soooo Good. Definitely a place to go for some home cooked comfort food. Great family restaurant and what a cool atmosphere! all the bears! Kids love to look at all the different bears, The staff is always helpful, friendly and quick to get you anything you need and they look happy , unlike some waitresses at other restaurants in this town. So overall, check out the Black bear Diner well worth it !!"}
{"text":"As advertised... Service was super and food was fantastic.. Very happy to learn that Black Bear Diner wasn't exlusive to Big Bear Lake.. Excited to try it, and it did not disappoint.. Bacon was thick and the harvest cakes were hearty and delicious.. Even had a good cup of coffee.. Great start to the morning."}
{"text":"Our third or fourth visit to the Dysart Rd. location. Twice now we have had Cathy as our server.  This morning Cathy was once again top notch.  Very professional and attentive to all of our needs. We like how she remains friendly but very professional.  Cathy doesn't try to win us over with a fake, friendly personality.  She seems as if she is a veteran server who just knows what it takes to get her job and customers taken care of.  Very rare nowadays.  

 The diner itself is always busy,  but the staff as a whole keeps the tables turning quickly.  Kudos to the cooks as well for prompt service and always a consistent quality.  

Good job Black Bear staff.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I love the vibe of this diner the waiters are nice and the manager is great we come here every other week and the manager sometime remembers us love the breakfast here  can feed up to 2 people I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I love this place and I am rarely impressed by restaurants. I have had the ScramBOWL twice and it was very good. For dinner I had the chicken fried steak. The chicken fried steak wasn't anything to write home about, but the mashed potatoes and green beans were very good. The wait staff are friendly and get the job done."}
{"text":"Service was ok at best. After waiting for a long period of time for my food it came out cold."}
{"text":"First timer and let me tell you BOMB! :) I definitely traded TJ ' S Homestyle which is down the street. I loved it here."}
{"text":"This is my favorite \"go to\" place for breakfast. The pancakes rock and the coffee is frag and hot. Love the atmosphere. Come so often, they know or name, especially Bob.  LOL"}
{"text":"Soooo happy we found this place! The atmosphere and decor are adorable and speak to our family. The prices are reasonable but the quality of the food and the friendliness of the waitstaff are awesome! Our family was so glad to find a great breakfast spot close to home and are planning on coming back for lunch and dinner! Could spend days here!"}
{"text":"Good place to fuel up for the drive to LA.

Yummy housemade corned beef hash
+ generous portions
+ homey decor
+ fun concept (menu written in what looks like a town paper)
+ friendly service 
= good value"}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast spot! They have a solid menu with reasonable prices as well as large portions. You can actually turn The Grizz into two or three meals.The California benedict is great! I definitely suggest anyone to at here. It's close by my house and I will be returning for years!"}
{"text":"This has been the third time eating at this location and never experience. The service has alway been great Fresh OJ!! Easy parking! Each visit a different breakfast and they were all good. Never been on a weekend but I'm sure they place would be full so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"The food here is very very good. They have huge portions for every item on the menu and they have breakfast all day which is what I get. 

This place is a way better value then some of the big chain breakfast places ( you know which ones I'm talking about)

The servers are usually older and more mature/experienced with serving. Great service. 

I love this place. Go here!"}
{"text":"I stopped in there based on the good reviews. I had a taco salad and it was huge and very good. Diner was clean and the staff was very friendly. In fact my waitress was super cute! I would recommend it too all."}
{"text":"What kind of restaurant closes for the night and doesn't post it on their website  and doesn't  tell anyone ? They get zero from me. Not the way to run a business   !"}
{"text":"Very good place to eat. I love traditional diners and this place definitely fits in. Great, quality food, generous portions, awesome servers, and oldies music. A waitress even stopped by to say hello, we were not in her section but she remembered us from the time before. I would definitely recommend this place. This place may be part of a chain, but definitely has that family feel to it."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Evem better when its not during peak times. My #1 pick for breakfast eats when out and about!"}
{"text":"Delicious! My husband and I ate here for the first time after recently relocating to the area. We will definitely be back. Really good eggs Benedict. I had the California Benedict and it was cooked perfectly and very tasty. My husband had the corned beef hash, which btw is definitely not from a can! Thank god! We also shared a pancake that came with my husbands meal and by far one of the best I have had! It tastes like a vanilla cake. Loved it! By far one of the best breakfast places around!"}
{"text":"We were looking for some good diner food while we were in Las Vegas.  Our hotel wasn't far from Black Bear Diner, so we decided to give it a try.  We loved it.  I had the chicken-fried steak, and hubby got the meatloaf.  Corn muffins came with the dinner.  Everything was delicious, including the surprisingly good coffee.  

We usually don't go back to a restaurant when we have so many choices, but this was too good to pass up."}
{"text":"Had an awesome lunch at Black Bear Diner.  We had great service from the host to our server Mindy.  I had the pot roast melt as recommended by Mindy (best melt ever) and my girlfriend had their HUGE chicken steak (10 oz.) which wound up being 3 meals for her even after my help.  We were so full we wound up getting the Black Beary cobbler to go which was also amazing.  We will definitely be back with Mindy hopefully as our server but if that's not the case I'm sure we will be treated just the same.  Thank you to the staff at BBD from the front of the house to the amazing cooks and chef in the back."}
{"text":"Had a delicious traditional Thanksgiving dinner at Black Bear Diner on Alma School yesterday!  This is the second time we've eaten there but certainly will not be the last.  They have numerous items we want to try."}
{"text":"Pancakes are flavorful and sweet. The bacon is really good. Not no thin dry bacon either. Everything was very tasteful . The hash browns are real potatoes, thick a little crispy...perfect! I enjoy the hot sauce selection , especially the habenero. I will come back."}
{"text":"Great experience all around. Tons of good food for little money, great service, comfortable atmosphere. I will be going back!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS waffles! Great service!
We also love the chocolate pie!"}
{"text":"I really like it here! We eat here the morning of our trip home from Vegas. I've been 3 times now and all times have been fantastic. The people are also SUPER nice. :)"}
{"text":"Very poor service.  The staff are lost and the cooks are extremely slow.  Waited over an hour for food to come out.  On top of the wait time all five of our orders were wrong.  It take effort to get every single order wrong.  We just took food how it came out because we were hungry , did not want to waste more time, and more importantly didn't trust that they could get it right the second time.  I would not recommend this location. Avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"Looking for a little bit of \"Old Vegas\" charm and service?  Look no further... Always busy, Always quick seating and always great food and service!  The kids enjoy the chocolate chip pancakes and cook to order scrambled eggs.  The French toast is fantastic as well.  Coffee is good. We took an apple pie home from the display case up front last time and it was to die for.  The decor and booths are older so this is definitely a local favorite hang out.  Plenty of food to fill you up."}
{"text":"We love this place... The food is always excellent as is the service... We always suggest this restaurant whenever we have family visiting from out of town... We are never disappointed with this restaurant... The food portions are big... The atmosphere is good... It's a kid friendly place... Some might say it's a bit pricey but it's well worth it... I really recommend this restaurant... It's five start worthy!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went in for Breakfast. We were sat right away. Good coffee excellent fresh squeezed oj. Our waitress was prompt and attentive. I had the corn beef hash. Some of the best hash I have ever had, eggs cooked over medium were perfect. Husband had bacon and eggs. He was very satisfied aswell. 

Bonus free pie because it was husband birthday."}
{"text":"One of the worst breakfast I have every had. Hash browns were undercooked and not hash browns but potatos cut like flat noodles. Eggs looked like they cooked them a large number of other eggs was a yok with a little ring of white around. At least half of our group had something missing from their order. Took forever to serve food. O yea they biscuits tasted lile baking powered.. Basicly horrible from start to first. Some if of our party didnt eat all and went to jersey mikes after"}
{"text":"Here in town for a RV rally.  Chili cheeseburger is very good.  Menu has a lot of choices."}
{"text":"Good pancakes, as well as portions. May want to share a meal if you are not a big eater."}
{"text":"This Place is our new Stop in Las Vegas :) great food and super nice Service, Thank You April :)
My Steak and Eggs were better prepared than at the Voodoo Steakhouse at the Rio, where we paid 10x more for lousy food! 
My Wife loved her Patty Melt and all in all great vibe in the House :)"}
{"text":"I love this place fast and friendly very clean...the people are so nice...great food come down and have some great fool"}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Black Bear you've been seriously missing out. Now I have to say that I haven't had a chance to try any of lunch or dinner menu items yet because the breakfast is soooooo damn good that it's just impossible to look past their California bacon benny or that deliciously fluffy biscuit or the sweet pancakes or the country potatoes or... OMG I'm hungry just thinking about it. 

There's so much that we appreciate about the place; the friendly faces, the mixed local clientele, the fresh better than homemade cooking,  but one thing we love is the portions. The food is phenomenal but the fact that they give you just enough food that when you leave you're not leaving with doggy bags full of food for 2 more meals. They don't make the food to be fancy or outrageous. It's focus is wowing your palette, great customer service and providing an excellent overall dining experience."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Fresh squeezed orange juice. We had the Blackbear choice. Two eggs, choice of pancakes, sweet cream waffle or biscuits and gravy and your choice of meat. We opted for no pork and got hash browns instead. We also got a side of chicken sausage. So good and a lot food. Loved our waitress. She was very nice and helpful. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My Husband and I enjoyed Black Bear Cafe.  Went there for breakfast.  He had the biscuits and gravy and I had the cinnamon roll French toast.  Food was great, service was awesome.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place serves some of the best food.  The portions are huge too.  Definitely  worth  trying if you haven't."}
{"text":"I would love to speak about the food BUT today I cannot.  We were never served.  My group of five was told when we asked when putting in our name that the wait would be 20 min. We waited patiently for an extended period of time.  What made us wonder was when after 45 min someone came out to say the wait would be 20 min.  Seemed to be a pat response since the place had more people go in than leave.  A large group was seated before us.  We went to ask how much longer and the hostess only response was she couldn't say because she couldn't ask people to leave. I explained if they had been honest in the beginning that it would be 45 min wait we would have gone somewhere else.  The hostess AND the cashier both repeated themselves that it is only an estimate and they can't ask people to leave.  Since they could explain to me after 45 min wait that the reason we were a longer wait was because it was a party of 5 -- I tried to explain that would have been benefiical in using their skills to estimate in the beginning. NEVER DID THEY OR THE MANAGER WHO CAME UP AND LISTENED DURING THE SECOND TIME THROUGH EXPRESS ANY CONCERN WITH THE INVONVENIENCE. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST UNLESS YOU HAVE NO LIFE AND CAN WAIT ALL MORNING TO BE SEATED"}
{"text":"One star is generous. Terrible service and more importantly condescending management.  With both my wife and I having both served and managed in the service industry, We are normally really understanding when issues happen. However, this put me over the edge.  

The last three times I've either ate here or at ordered takeout it is been messed up. 
Last weekend, we ordered A few pastries to go.  The person who took my order told me to come right down as it will be ready.  I arrive at the restaurant to be told by the cashier that sorry there is a problem, it's gonna be 20 more minutes. Obviously I'm frustrated but fine at this point I'll wait.  30 minutes later still no food and manager comes over to me and says we have a problem we don't have the food you ordered.  I replied \"now you're telling me that? I've been told two different stories and now you don't even have the food that I've been waiting 30 minutes for?\"

The managers reply:  \"I just heard about this.  What do you want ME to do\"?

Are you joking?  You are the manager. How about customer service.  Maybe some honesty to start and try setting proper expectations for your customers.  Things happen however do not reply with \"what do you want me to do\". 

Done."}
{"text":"Hostess Michelle was the rudest person I have ever meet in my life, she was rude in greeting us, was disrespectful to my peer then can back to our table to yell at us after we gave her manager feedback the only saving the place was our waiter Jonathan, wish I could giver her a negative star ."}
{"text":"We love Black Bear but won't go back to the Las Vegas Blvd location. Ordered our regular \"corned beef w/potatoes plate\". CB came to us in crumbles! When we brought it to server's attention, she said she'd never seen it made like that before. She brought manager to table who insisted that's the only way BB makes it. Told her that we had it \"regular way\" many times @ other BB locations. She ended up bringing another plate cooked more like what we were used to. Why would we make up what we had before?! And why would we order it again there if we didn't like the way it was prepared @ other locations?! We also order a \"coconut custard\" pie to bring home as the server assured us it really was delicious coconut-custard - only to be sorely disappointed! It was like no other coconut custard pie we'd ever had. After one piece, it went in the garbage! So disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ditto everything Jon D. (who knew he was such a good food critic/restaurant reviewer!) said on 12/15/2016. Sorry I'm so slow! We have been to a couple of Black Bear Diners since we discovered them in Reno last summer. Always enjoy it there. Food & service both good. We did have one experience at Durango/Sahara restaurant last year where pancakes were not good at all. Manager was so apologetic & credited me my entire meal. We'll definitely go back to BBD - & especially this location."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was horrible. Waiter had no experience and never checked on us.  We had to fend for ourselves when we asked for things.  Was also disappointed that there were NO holiday decorations, especially two days before Christmas."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever! Be prepared for the large portions! Food is delicious and the waitress was super nice and all smiles. Had the Hungry Man New York Steak and Eggs-WOW...Steak was juicy, tender and pretty good size (10 oz),  large portion of homestyle potatoes and large serving of thick toast. Their sweet cream pancakes are to die for too!"}
{"text":"Service was great, thus the 2 stars. Food....eggs were cooked correctly. Corn beef hash so dry I had to sip water after each bite. The biscuit was literally brown, should never have left the kitchen.  The place looks so dirty they should be embarrassed. If ever corporate needed to send a secret shopper it is here. Like I said the only thing this place has going for it was the service."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service.

This is a great place to come for a good down home style breakfast. The homemade sausage is the highlight of the menu. Pancakes are excellent too. I agree with the other reviews about the bears being a little weird but it gives it a homey feel to it. Great place for a family breakfast on Sundays or Holidays."}
{"text":"I love this place. Everyone is very friendly and the biscuits are huge! The sausage is excellent and they serve beer. Ask for heather, very punctual and professional. We will be regulars here."}
{"text":"This is the second time we've been here and the food held up both times! Big portions for a really reasonable price. Tasty food, be it breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Hand-squeezed orange juice, everything made and tasted fresh.

The inside of the diner was super cute as well! Bears adorned the paintings on the walls, hand carved bear families greeted everyone outside, paw prints on all the napkins and plates.... It was so charming! You can tell they took their motif very seriously. Sometimes that might seem tacky but it felt perfect for this homey place.

Staff was very attentive and sweet the first time! The second time, they were very busy so they couldn't shower us with attention. But not really a bad thing! It's nice to see a good establishment get business! 

Very nice staff, great food and prices, clean and cute insides, a well put together and extensive menu.. 
Definitely a win of a place!
Stop by Black Bear Diner and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Great service. Good prices. Incredible portions. Even my picky toddler ate everything we offered him! Still took home enough food for another meal! The bisquits were absolutely amazing and huge! Thanks Trina for an amazing breakfast. We will definately be coming back!"}
{"text":"Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs.  Homemade gravy.  That's all you need to know.   

After viewing some YELP reviews about their chicken fried steak, this Texas born and raised girl had to make a special trek across this desert valley to test the YELP opinions about what could be \"the best chicken fried steak\" in town.  So far, this is the best chicken fried steak I have had in Las Vegas.  

A rookie visitor here, I was pleasantly surprised by how friendly the staff was.  For a busy Saturday morning, with more than a 45 minute wait - the staff was extra friendly and working their tails off.  

Unlike some other reviews I see, the place was filled with a very diverse clientele.  Very diverse.  I saw many people from every racial and ethnic background in this place.  

The food was excellent.  They have a wonderful kids menu as well.  Our little one had her first ham and egg scramble here - and she ate all of it!  

My final thoughts?  It is worth the drive across town for the chicken fried steak - whether for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  If hungry for anything else, I would probably stick to places closer to my home.  

For Las Vegas southerners who might crave a chicken fried steak once or twice a year - this is my favorite so far.  Not exactly like my momma's - but nothing comes close to a momma's CFS."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place especially for breakfast only downside is at times it gets so busy it can take a while to be seated"}
{"text":"The server was great the food was okay the wait was long not as good as Gilbert black bear."}
{"text":"We have had many decent experiences with this venue.  However, I have never had an exemplary experience.  Today, my wife and her family dined here and the service was subpar.  As was the quality.  The waitress was sure to point out that she took the drinks off the bill, as there was a supposed issue with the printers to the cooks.  A group that was sat 30-40min later were served at the same time.  Being in he hospitality industry, this is obviously not right.  Hope they get their act together, as they have a great theme..."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place so decided to check it out last weekend for breakfast. Very busy place with lots of options. I ordered the corned beef hash meal. The menu noted that the brisket was roasted in house so that peaked my interest. Now, I haven't tried corned beef before but what I ended up getting was shredded brisket jerky which I don't think is how it's supposed to be. The meat was really dry and stringy. Not a bad flavor but the texture really threw me off. The meal also came with scrambled eggs which were fine and a cup of fruit. Will try this place again but I don't recommend the corned beef hash."}
{"text":"Simply AMAZING! We're traveling by on I-10 and found it a convenient location. Hardly ever do I see breakfasts too large for me to order! I got a Standard 2-egg breakfast with homemade sausage links. The food was all excellent, great hash browns and a huge biscuit. Cooked nicely. We ordered in a few min and it came in 3 minutes! You must stop here. We will be back soon! JD"}
{"text":"Well this is a regular place I love to come to but today they did not do as good as usual. The food was excellent and plentiful. Great value for the buck but the service from the front, server and everything else just fell flat. The manager just stood around looking like he didn't know what to do and didn't help at all. So good food saved the day this time for this review"}
{"text":"Best black bear restaurant out here.. Great food and service. I highly recommend it but just be prepared to wait some because it is always busy especially on weekends."}
{"text":"Love this Place! I always get the Classic Eggs Benedict and I am never disappointed. Fresh squeezed Orange Juice, Huge Portions, great prices.  I'll be Back! (Again and again)"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to have their Friday \"All you can eat\" fish fry special for dinner. The meal consisted of two pieces of batter fried fish (pollack I was told), two hush puppies, fries and coleslaw.   While the quality of the fried fish wasn't bad it wasn't exceptional either as were the other side dishes.  The All you can eat is limited to only the fish and hush puppies, excluding the fries and coleslaw which was odd in my opinion.  So diners be aware of this little know fact.

The condiments at the table were interesting as Black Bear Dinners have their own brand of different hot sauces.  Our favorite was their Serracha hot sauce which differs from the traditional Asian Serracha but is very good none the less.  However they did not have malt vinegar for the fried fish and fries.  Those who love the delicious taste malt vinegar adds to \"fish and chips\" know what I'm talking about.

The restaurant wasn't packed but the service was slow especially for seconds.  However our waitress had numerous tables to attend to so this could explain the slow service.  

The cost per person for the fish fry is $8.99 so overall it was an average dining experience.  I wish I could have rated it higher but \"average\" is the best I can honestly give at this time."}
{"text":"Terrific home-style comfort food in a pleasant, informal, clean atmosphere. I found this place while in Vegas on business and have eaten here multiple times on the same trip. Food and service are equally excellent. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ordered the benedict, eggs were hard boiled. Gross!! My sons bacon was raw, very disappointed."}
{"text":"We first went there for a post hangover breakfast. If I recall correctly there was 6 of us. The waitress came over and got out order and NEVER WROTE A THING DOWN, I mean not a single word, no note pad for this girl. After 10 minutes of discussing there was no way she could get our order right out food came out....exactly as we all ordered it. That is impressive service. 

Now on to the food....Massive portions, lots of meat(steak, bacon, sausage, ham, you get the idea) heaping mounds of hash browns or country potatoes and pancakes as big as your head-seriously they are big pancakes. The food is damn good, not the best ever but damn good so good in fact we go every Sunday as a group to eat there. Nothing is low cal, just good filling food. 

The waitress who never writes anything down is still there. We asked her about her ability and she informed us she once took an order for a group of 27 people and never wrote a thing down and got it all correct. she is officially known as the girl with the genius brain!! 

So when you want good, solid food go here, you will be happy."}
{"text":"I went to the Black Bear Diner in Chandler, AZ with my family on the morning of Valentine's Day. 

The female hostess that I checked in told me it was a 50 minute wait. I asked if I could come back rather than wait the entire time and she said that was permissible. 

I came back with my family 38 minutes later. The male host when I checked in couldn't locate my name. He called the female hostess who had originally taken my name as well as the manager over to assist him. The manager said they had called my name \"a long time ago\" and \"that many people don't come when their name is called... There's nothing we can do about that.\" 

The manager did not offer my family and I the option to wait and see when they could next accommodate my family and I with a table, so we left.

I have been to Black Bear Diner locations in Nevada and California and enjoyed my previous experiences. The Black Bear Diner in Chandler is very popular since they recently opened. I realize that this location is very busy and in demand.  

However, I will never return to this location after this first experience. Their customer service with my experience was very disappointing and their manager was unwelcoming and rude at the Black Bear Diner in Chandler, AZ."}
{"text":"My husband and I were given a Gift Certificate to the Black Bear Diner for Christmas.   It turned out to be more than \"just a gift,\"  as we absolutely loved our visit, enjoyed the food immensely and had the pleasure of meeting most of the staff while there.   It was just TERRIFIC!   We plan on returning, as the menu items intrigued us to the point of saying, \"oh, I am going to order 'THIS' the next time.\"

We both had the meatloaf dinner at lunch time.  It was a very generous portion and it was delicious!  Meatloaf, mashed potatoes, veggies, soup or salad, then potato salad or cole slaw, and a homemade corn muffin.   One menu item was better than the other!    While eating, our server recommended the pot roast, and we did order a pot roast dinner to take home for that night.   Looking forward to eating that later today!

Our server was remarkable.  His name was GARY, and I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND him.  He was professional, yet very friendly.   He anticipated our every need before we could ask, i.e.  more napkins, more water, more salad dressing, etc.   GARY is presently working there on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, beginning at 6 a.m.   His hard work and pleasant demeanor should be recognized by management, as he was a superior server and a really nice guy.  :))

The Diner itself is very  appealing.  It is extraordinarily CLEAN, neat and provides a very pleasant environment.   Watch out for the yummy looking desserts in the case by the cashier's desk.  OMG, I felt as though I gained 5 lbs just by looking at it.

We highly recommend this location for their superior food and service, in addition to the cleanliness of the Diner.

Looking forward to seeing the employees again.

Sincerely,
 Helen & Bob"}
{"text":"I went to have a late breakfast on December 28th and the restaurant was packed.  I didn't have to wait that long for a table and my waitress Chrystal took my order right away.  I ordered the linguica and the plate was the size of a skateboard.  I watched as my waitress ran around like a bee in a hive but she made sure that she checked in with me quite often.  The manager I think Don even came by to see if everything was o.k.  All in all it was a really pleasant experience.  Great service and great food."}
{"text":"I have been to four locations ,they are all great and very consistent.  The restaurant is clean and the restrooms are serviced regularly. Wait staff is very friendly"}
{"text":"Loved it. Authentic corned beef hash unlike any other; it was delicious lean shredded beef brisket. My husband enjoyed chicken fried steak. Fun bear decor and quiet dining experience. Very good service."}
{"text":"We are regulars here at Black Bear. The food is very good and the portions are generous. We feel that the prices are reasonable. Marlene is a great waitress! She has a great personality and it's always a pleasure to have her as our waitress. She is very personable with all her customers."}
{"text":"cute little place! 
the food was good and the service was good too.
décor was cute too.
yummy chicken fried chicken!!!"}
{"text":"Awesomeness tried the bigfoot chicken fried steak must try staff friendly good prices and went the next day got the hungry man steak and eggs both a winner."}
{"text":"First time coming to black bear and Marlene (PM Sup) was our server. Marlene customer service was beyond amazing as well as the food. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Really enjoy the decorum and friendliness offered at this breakfast joint. The large plated meals are really great- I always order the volcano (2 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 sausage, 3 large pancakes) but I am always surprised how long it takes to deliver our order to the table. Breakfasts like bacon and eggs are so easy to prepare but it takes as long or longer  to enjoy than it would at even Red Robin or Hash House. The food is good though and if the company is good, there's little need to complain- unless you are the one waiting for a table."}
{"text":"Cute diner, had a small wait on Saturday morning, but not too bad. I ordered the mini volcano expecting a small plate of food and it was a very generous portion. The pancakes were huge and fluffy and everything tasted great. Their fresh squeezed orange juice was delicious, and the staff was friendly.  Good place to bring your family and it has a cute theme to it."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we decided to try this diner. It's a cute little cozy place with lots of bears everywhere. Our server was Marlene and she took the time to explain the menu and was just super sweet. I had the chicken club and my friend had the open turkey sandwich. We both loved our food!! We had an amazing experience here at the black bear diner!!"}
{"text":"Sorry this is so late, but about a month ago, my husband and I had dinner at BBD, Sahara location. We have always loved the one on Tropicana, so were excited to have this one open closer to home. Unfortunately, there is no comparison between the two. We were greeted well and seated right away. It took a few minutes for our server to take our drink orders, iced tea for both of us. It must have been freshly brewed because what little ice there was melted rapidly. We asked for more ice when we finally found our server who was apparently hiding somewhere and was certainly not focused on her job. We had to wait about 40 minutes for our food to arrive and my hubby's  fried chicken was so overcooked, he had to send it back. I ordered the smaller portion meatloaf dinner, and small it was. One slice about the size of a deck of cards, a scoop of potatoes and green beans was on the plate, however it arrived with no gravy on the meatloaf or potatoes. Again couldn't find the server, but she rushed over with a side dish of gravy about 5 minutes later. All in all, a very disappointing dinner. The two stars are for the hostess and the comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Slow front of house probably due to the many unbused tables.  We had to ask twice for utensils difficult stirring coffee without them.  Slow service and no sign of management.  We were here a week ago and things were good.  Ramp up staff and make sure they know their roles"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Is everything perfect, no, but when you take great food, great servers and awesome desserts, it all comes together near perfect harmony. The food blows away any other chain restaurant, and I love the servers. Especially Trina!! She is the best. If I had to find a fault, I would say it's in the host staff. They seem confused and really not sure what to do next. A good host is the conductor of a restaurant, and so far, they've not found theirs, but in their defense, it's still a fairly new store.  Overall, a great place for any meal of the day. Now I'm hungry!!"}
{"text":"Love this place...Michael was a great server,even though he was in training he was very attentive. Me & my husband will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Another standard off-strip place that this tourist couple likes to visit on every trip to Vegas.   Good hearty breakfast and lunch, friendly staff, nice bear-themed decor (love the \"Bears Playing Poker\" mural), and great prices.

Offers all the standard breakfast fare like pancakes, waffles, french toast, eggs, fruit, oatmeal, etc..."}
{"text":"Saw Kenie today after a few months.  Love her .......she is so sweet and kind.   Makes going out to breakfast so much more enjoyable! Had chorizo scramble . Fantastic . .Mmmmm"}
{"text":"We've been watching the progress of the remodeling that went on with the new Black Bear diner in Henderson & were so happy to be there for breakfast on opening day! All the staff were great with high energy levels & the cooks did a terrific job in the kitchen! Comfortable seating, never empty coffee cup completed the perfect 1st day!! If you keep that up, we'll definitely be spending more time here! You all set a high bar on the first day!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place 3 times so far.  I will be going to back for more. 
Pro's -
Portion size vs price.  You get more then you pay for.
Customer service.   Always friendly
Menu- Nice selection
Seating- Fat guy friendly; not jammed together like sardines in a can.
Cons-
Waiting- This place is always busy. On the weekend expect 15 minutes.
Kids- This is a family diner. Expect kids misbehaving and babies crying.

Final thought- 
If your looking for a quaint, cozy, Mimi's cafe experience. Then go to Mimi's cafe. If you want a Mans Meal, if you want to walk in hungry and walk out stuffed, if you want to park your a$$ down and chow on some good home cooking grub. Then hit this place up. 

Families, blue collars, and elderly folks eat there. Expect to wait 15 to 30 minutes for a table on the weekend between 8 and 11am. The sweet cream pancakes are awesome. The Griz, will put you in a food coma. 

I take off one star for one reason.  Seasoning, to cater to as many customers as possible many of the dishes that I sampled in my three trips there were a little under seasoned.  My family and friends like to share, so we take a bite of this or that from each others plates. It is to be expected though with as many elderly customers as come in.

All in all great place to eat."}
{"text":"Great food, breakfest is amazing and lunch is also great! They give you large portions of food. Check them out if your ever in the area and want a good meal."}
{"text":"OMG! EXCELLENT! The food was good! The service was excellent! I had the Patty sausage combo with the spicy sausage and country potatoes. The sausage was spicy without being so spicy that you couldn't eat it. It was really flavorful. The country potatoes were awesome, but hey, I'm a potato person. My son had pancakes and the sweet cream pancakes were delicious. You probably wouldn't even need to use syrup. My husband ordered The Grizz and he said it was excellent and we will be back again and again and again. We ordered all this and a pie to go and it all came up to under $50!  The prices were good, the food was good and the service was good! Thank you to our server Flower. She was nice and attentive. We will be back!"}
{"text":"If you decided to go here, be ready with a big bear appetite (literally). All the a available means are perfect for families and sharing. Great place."}
{"text":"Went at about lunchtime on a Sunday, and there was only about a five minute wait. This is a busy little place, but seems worth the wait. The biscuits and gravy were very good, and the portions large. They have a nice selection of mini pies and the entire menu is available all day long. The waitress was very attentive and efficient, and the food was delish. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"A dyed-in-the-wool hamburger joint will never serve a hamburger with grated cheese instead of a slice of cheese chopped lettuce instead of a leaf.  It will always have the bun buttered and grilled. Most important of all it will have onions on it unless asked to be omitted. Needless to say, the Black Bear Diner does not come close to a good old fashioned hamburger. However, the staff are always smiling and cheerful."}
{"text":"The food is so good. The staff is very friendly. This is my go-to lunch place. Try the Caesar salad is amazing."}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner has some great food.
I really like \"The Grizz\" for breakfast.
Occasionally the food is a little undercooked if they are too busy.
They often try to rush you out the door. Like, bringing the check while you're still eating. 
Picking up plates as soon as they can. Checking back every minute while we're still looking at the menu, it's like: Really man? We're clearly still looking at the menu. While usually being prompt isn't a bad thing, this seems like they want you in and out as fast as possible."}
{"text":"If you like micro waved biscuits, fatty bacon, cold tasteless food, this is your place.
Sausage gravy-disgusting! Would make great wall paper paste.

Mike"}
{"text":"Normally, I would not have eaten 4 pieces of crispy fried chicken, mashed potatoes with white gravy, green beans, corn muffins and green salad in one sitting, but I did. The food quality and the flavor of the food was excellent! The service was excellent, as well!"}
{"text":"All the food coming out of the kitchen looked so good...especially the chicken fried steak and pancakes.   Since it was dinner time I opted for the asian chicken salad.  Very large portion.  Tasty chicken and light dressing.  Very satisfying.  Excellent service.  Reminds me of being back in the Midwest.   Ill be back for breakfast...and will probably have to have pie as well!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with my colleague yesterday, just 2 hungry nurses...maybe it was the scrubs...I don't know. 
Worst service ever!!!  Our waitress brought our food out cold.  Yum, cold eggs! Threw the food on the table, and that was the last we saw of her, until she dropped the check. Never checked back, never refilled our drinks...ignored us completely! 
The food at Black Bear is mediocre at best...add poor service and it's not worth sitting down. 
I will never go back... Ever!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and very friendly staff. A great place to eat that is \"off the Strip.\""}
{"text":"Love this place! Their breakfast is awesome. My friend is a breakfast fanatic and brought me here one morning. I see why she's here on a weekly basis now. It's worth it just for the huge delicious biscuits. Chicken and waffles were great, corned beef hash was awesome! New regular spot."}
{"text":"Read all the reviews before coming here.  Pretty much in line with what other yelpers are talking about.  Food is decent, service just ok.  We lucked out with a nice waiter.  Not the most experienced, but at least tried.  Plus we hit it before the Sunday rush, so no wait.  
Too pricey for what it is.  Breakfast shouldn't be $31 for two people at a place like this.
Will probably say been there done that and move along to try new places for breakfast."}
{"text":"Wonderful and woodsy atmosphere! Bear themed interior and exterior, with a rustic touch. Large , comfortable booths with soft music wafting through the dining area. Happy and attentive (but not overly) wait staff. Hot, delicious food with generous helpings. Will definitely be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Just left Black Bear diner and it was fabulous. Excellent food, lovely and clean and exceptional service. It was our first visit there and certainly not our last.  We went for breakfast but next time we will try lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here.  The portions are LARGE, the price is right and the food is great. OMG! - The biscuits, so so good!!   If you like hashbrowns, this place knows hashbrowns.  Decor is fun, lots of bears, stuffed, wooden etc.  The staff was friendly and service was good.  Thanks Yelp for recommending this place.  Next time we are in Vegas we'll go here again."}
{"text":"Sat night. 
Bad service 
Over priced food
Waited 1 hour for the wrong order to be delivered. 
Won't be back"}
{"text":"Good prices and goog service, great stake and eggs you can't beat the price."}
{"text":"This was my first experience ast this location. The atmosphere and staff welcomed you like family it was nice. I had the Southern Scramble and Cindy Ray (best waitress ever). Customer service performed like it should be."}
{"text":"The vibe of this restaurant is great. It's welcoming and nostalgic and we felt right at home. Staff is friendly, food is piping hot and most importantly tastes good. Our kids love coming here for breakfast."}
{"text":"Was visiting Vegas for four nights and came here twice. Twice!  It's that good.  Come with a hearty appetite for large portions of delicious food served by friendly wait staff.  I wish this were a local joint as I'd be a regular. For those of you lucky enough to have Black Bear Diner as an option for food, choose it. You won't regret your decision."}
{"text":"Disappointed..... Large servings for breakfast, but not very tasty.  Lamps over the tables are dirty and that is a turnoff.  I do not need to return.  Staff was nice."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite hang out for southern comfort foods.  The portions are massive and the prices are affordable.  We have always received decent service.  It was a problem finding good southern food, i.e.country fried steak and fried chicken around the valley, this place was a rare find. The chicken fried chicken is really good, crispy and juicy.  The breakfast plates are also very good.  It is a good thing they serve it all day!!!"}
{"text":"I thought the food and service was great.  Large menu but prepared very well.  Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Awesome food, friendly staff and creative dishes.
The homemade cinnamon buns are ridiculously good."}
{"text":"I was stoked to eat here tonight, knew what I wanted. Took over 8 min to get drinks, all is well order is in. Chix and waffles come. Eating ... Eating ... Cut another piece to share with my friend and she stopped me and my chix was raw  I was so bummed. Was told a manager would come by. Then server came back said she took it off and that I get free desert. While the desert was good. I still consumed raw chix, hopefully don't get sick, and wasnt addressed by management."}
{"text":"Great breakfast!  Gravy needs sausage, but one can't complain with service like this!"}
{"text":"I love this place - great service and food.  The best chicken fried steak I've ever had."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been eating here for four years, and have stuck with it for good reason.  I used to live nearby, but even after moving an extra 15 minutes away, we're still happy to make the drive at least once a month to get what we find is the best breakfast in Vegas.  All of the waiters know us, and know our usual orders.  Quick, simple, good food at reasonable prices.  We even get tons of coupons after signing up with the Black Bear website.  We always make sure to show up early, since after 9 in the morning you can easily get caught up in a 30 minute wait for a table- and that's proof that we're not alone in having this place on our list of favorites."}
{"text":"Don't get the hype here. Ordered the popular chicken fried steak and ended up smothering it with tabasco sauce and salt to add some flavor to the gravy. Sweet cream pancakes were decent. The orange juice was too sour but the coffee was good."}
{"text":"My husband and I just found the Best Black Bear Diner right here in Glendale AZ!
 We have been fans of Black Bear Diners since we first got married in on the 4th of July in 1987.
  Over the years we've had the pleasure of dining at them in Gilroy, Salinas, and Carmel, California as well as in Reno and Fernley Nevada. This one in Glendale is one of the best we've ever encountered!
   Having just moved here 3 weeks ago, a doctor's appointment brought us to Glendale and we were starved and in need of a great place to eat! We were delighted to find this Black bear Diner within one block of where we were.
   We not only had the most delicious lunch today, but outstanding service too! Our waitress Cathy was momentarily busy, so Mike the manager came over and offered to get us started with our drinks. In no time Cathy came and took our order which was ready in no time. The food was served hot and was really delicious!  The onion rings were the best I've had in a long time...crunchy and hot but not greasy!!! We're definitely going back soon!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service kept up on refills.  Waitress was happy and seemed like she enjoyed serving.  Ordered \"the grizz\" which was a LOT of food. Wife had a big cheeseburger we had to use 4togo boxes."}
{"text":"Waited outside for an hour. Waited at the table for an hour for food. Half of the food was cold, and the service was terrible. Will never return. I understand that Sunday is a busy day, but that doesn't make it acceptable to serve cold food, and leave your patrons waiting for as long as they did."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and decided to try this place out. We have about a 15 minute wait which wasn't bad because we knew it was very busy. Once we sat down we ordered right away and within 10 minutes our food came out. The food was absolutely excellent and extremely filling. Other than our waitress not being the greatest, everything was very impressive. She didn't pay very close attention to our drink orders, so waters were without lemons, and all coffee was caffeinated when asked for decaf."}
{"text":"We just ate at this Black Bear for the first time and loved it. We love all the Black Bears. You were fast, efficient and helpful. Great food and huge portion sizes. Everyone was helpful and sat us fast. We liked the bears all over the place and it was very clean."}
{"text":"Christine was our server today!! She was awesome. This place is always busy for breakfast and not only is the food awesome, but the service is spot on. Highly recommend eating here anytime. We actually saw the manager pitching in to help everyone because it was so busy. Great job to Black Bear! ;)"}
{"text":"Be careful!  We ordered fried chicken.  Looked wonderful.  However,  we  discovered that the chicken was dropped in the fryer while STILL FROZEN! Awful.  Luckily none of us had eaten any at that time. What made it worse was that our server told us, after we sent it all back, that several customers had already complained!"}
{"text":"The meal was just okay, nothing spectacular. The environment is nice and comfortable. The staff was friendly. But 30 dollars for breakfast for two just seems too high especially when the meal was okay. Needed some more flavor."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times. Service is great, food is good. Love all the bears. However,  my last meal there was horrible. Don't order chicken parmigian. Pasta was old, chicken was over cooked, dry, and unappealing to look at. Next time I'll stick with the tuna salad."}
{"text":"The food is so delicious and brings that home feeling back. The restaraunt has a great feel and great decorations. The food is so good the eggs Benedict practically melt and swirl flavors. The Chipotle sauce they make has such a unique and great taste. Alex the Great was one Amazing server recommend all the best things and was totally right."}
{"text":"The food was good.  I ordered the 'a little less' club with the parmesan fries.  Both were very good and 'the little less' was more than enough; a very good value.  My friend ordered the half tuna sandwich with the chicken gumbo.  This was also on the 'a little less' menu. A good portion for the right price.  I tasted the gumbo and although the flavor was good the spice was very hot and stayed with you.

The service was below expectations.  The server was pleasant.  He took our orders, delivered them and we never saw him again until he brought the check.  Never asked if we wanted anything else and didn't refill our tea glasses."}
{"text":"Lots and lots of very mediocre food. Cheerful but loud waitress. This place had a wait list full of huge patrons on a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Eaten there several times now pretty good and its local!  Service has been good but yesterday they forgot my coffee oh well I got it eventually it only bothered me for awhile because I needed coffee lol  Food was hot and yummy although my friend found a piece of plastic in his eggs!  But the manager cut the bill in half so that more than made up for the plastic!

Will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Great food about time laveen got a decent place to sit down and eat. Big portions all made fresh from scratch."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  My family and I were visiting from Yucca Valley and the breakfast was amazing and reasonably priced, the staff and manager were friendly and kind, and the children loved all the stuffed animals.  A must visit for folks passing through and we will be coming back."}
{"text":"My buddy and I travel to Vegas every year and this place is always great!! Besides having the best tasting home style food in Vegas, the service seals the deal on ensuring we make multiple stops here while we're in town. For those of you traveling from Texas, you'll truly appreciate the \" just like home\" cooking (and portions!) this place offers.  Ray , the manager, remembers us each year and his approach to Client Satisfaction is why his entire staff make you feel very welcomed! Our thanks to Ray and the entire LV Black Bear team!!!"}
{"text":"Have eaten there many times and have had good experience but last 2 times over 40 min to get food and today had to get it to go as was late after being there 45 min and still no food. Got to work and still didn't get to eat food. Was wasted $15. My last time eating there."}
{"text":"It's 10:30am, and still a 20min wait, everyone was friendly, took awhile to get our order in, but it was worth it, the chicken fried steak is outstanding here! Next time I'm taking a pie to go!"}
{"text":"Me and my family wanted a hearty meal after shopping, and this place did not disappoint! food was amazing staff was friendly and our waitress shantel was beyond amazing, she made us feel right at home, she recommended the cinnamon roll French toast and oh my gosh was she right, so delicious!our drinks were always full, and her personality was great made us laugh the whole time! Will be returning soon just based off service alone"}
{"text":"Giving this 4 stars for a couple of reasons first we decided to try on Father's Day and did call ahead seating got there within the 40min wait and figured we would still have a few mins longer...nope seated right away with my big family of 6!!!  Server was ok she didn't check much after food was brought but good was amazing and I forgave her!!! Loved the pancakes and the eggs benny were on point!!! The weren't playing when they said the portions were huge I haven't been able to eat since so kudos!!! Def take your fam here cute place, cute decor and great food!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my. So good. They have a big menu with all kinds of great things. I would have to say that they have one of the best biscuit and gravy breakfasts around. The portions are huge so there's always leftovers. It's also a great place to nurse a hangover."}
{"text":"I just thought I'd post an update.  I planned never to go back, but was with a friend who really wanted one of their breakfast items.  I skipped ordering ANY food whatsoever and merely ordered coffee and watched her eat.  As fate would have it, she had a BACK HAIR in her scrambled eggs (we are 2 for 2 now).  My gag reflex is going off as I type this.  My husband, friends, and I have renamed this place the Black Hair Diner, and we've decided they have actual black bears cooking in the kitchen, since they can't seem to keep black hairs out of their food."}
{"text":"So, I'm here From Los Angeles for my 26th birthday today! I had the Huevos Ranchers Benedict, and it was Absolutely  AWESOME! And I was TRUELY SURPRISED by the wait staff as they brought me my birthday ice cream singing happy birthday!!! Thank you soo much, it made my birthday more special!"}
{"text":"I cistitis the store on Thursday this week and was amazed on how there were no people there, the restaurant is new so it super clean and everything looks new. The food was delicious as usual and the waitress was super nice. This place is great for breakfast! Much better than IHOP or Denny's"}
{"text":"Today was our second visit to this place. We were four at  table and we all ordered meals served with fries. When we received our fries they were way too salty (plus the seasoning)!  So when we received the last plate, we told the waitress about the fries, and asked for them to be replaced, she didn't comment, just turned and left. This was the last time we saw her, she never came back to the table or even looked at us! When we were all done (+/- 20 min later), the Manager arrived at the table to tell us that the fries were almost ready. We told him that it was too late and we wanted just the check. He apologised and proposed that we have a desert to go. He also took a discount off our check. I am giving them 2 stars because even though the Manager tried to do what he could, the Server ruined our meal. She didn't even acknowledge us when we left."}
{"text":"Well just left this place extremely disappointed, been here several times very little issues, if ever. We were seated fairly quickly, got coffees and was told \"she will be right with you\". Well 15 minutes later still waiting,  after watching the staff have their I guess evening staff meeting at the front counter, I could not wait any longer.  I went to front desk said I will pay for my coffees. She asks me for the check..... Really.  Of course she must not have realized that I never got waited on so... No check. So I placed 3 dollars on the counter and walked out. Now I 'm at a very nice place called Mimi's. It's a shame I really like BBD.   By the way the diner was not crowded.  Hardly anyone there."}
{"text":"Upon arrival we noticed that all of the staff was happy to be there and happy we were there. They took the time to greet us, refill beverages, and seemed genuinely interested in our experience. 
My husband ordered the meatloaf off of the smaller portion menu. My daughter who is in college nearby, ordered the large portion of  the chicken Parmesan. I ordered the \"blast\".  All portions generated substantial leftovers for my daughter to carry back to her dorm. 
We finished the meal with the apple and peach cobblers. Both were good but the peach cobbler was cold throughout.
Overall, good food and good service."}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner has some really great food. It's breakfast food which is pretty hard to mess up but overall it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Visiting from Columbia, SC and asked the hotel valet for breakfast recommendations. He suggested this gem of a place. It was quaint and the server very professional. The entire party of 4 ate until we felt like bursting! Met several other tourists who found this place via local or yelp recommendations. Prices reasonable and just a short drive from expensive food on the strip. Would go back every time I am in town."}
{"text":"Portions are huge and a good price for the portions. I'm not a big diner person, but my husband is. It's nothing spectacular as far as taste, which is why I could only give it 3 stars. Overall, decent."}
{"text":"Had an awesome experience my server was excellent his name is darian ask for him he will make your experience awesome. Need more servers like this guy"}
{"text":"12/19/2013

I have frequenting this diner since before yelp and was always pleased with the food and service. 
My last two visits there have been very disappointing.  Both times eggs WAY undercooked, pancakes size range from silver dollar size to 8 inch but you do get three, sort of.  Sent the eggs back to have them cooked only to get back very cold pancakes and burnt eggs.  Wait staff obviously did not want to be there. Judging from the managers attitude I can understand why. 
The place is going downhill, floors filthy, bathrooms disgusting, food quality poor, and uncaring employees, look to the managers I say."}
{"text":"This morning woke up an wanted a hearty breakfast, for me that means black bear diner, great food big portions, I had the Joe bear scramble( eggs, season ground beef , spinach , sausage, onions and topped w/ cheese piled on diced red potato, I don't know y I do this but I had to try the cinnamon French toast.  They get two cinnamon rolls split it , egg wash it put it on griddle , very good jus takes a little syrup already sweet . Service was on point, even though it was very busy. I don't know how they can b so consistent even when they r getting slammed."}
{"text":"Visiting family in Tolleson came in for breakfast Huge portion's try the valcano"}
{"text":"Yummm.  This place is awesome!   The food is fresh & terrific.  Large portions too. The service is impeccable.  Great for breakfast,  brunch, lunch or dinner.  The OJ is fresh squeezed.  Take home a pie too."}
{"text":"Never going back. I was so excited  when this place opened, I used to drive to bullhead city just to eat here. ..so when this one opened I was so happy. Until I dined there...it was terrible. Too bad."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Very clean restaurant. This was our first visit, we'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"It's  good! Just a little bit of updates  mostly in the carpet and those teddy bears  needs  to go and donate coz it collects  dust. But all in all very nice traditional place  to eat."}
{"text":"Stopped by this location before we go on road for weekend trip.  Been to this chain before just not to this location.  Everyone from the hostess, waitress, and cashier were so pleasant.  Food was awesome and came really fast and hot. Portions are huge but really good for price so be prepared.  We were never left with empty drinks. Will come back again to this location."}
{"text":"Worst hash browns I ever had. They aren't cut up like normal hash browns and they seemed undercooked with no flavor whatsoever. The cashier let a couple jump in front of me even though I was next in line and tells  me she'd be right with me. Instead of helping me right after that she hopped on the phone and I didn't get helped until the manager came by and asked if someone was helping me. Meanwhile my food was sitting on the counter getting colder and colder. The hollandaise sauce on my Bears Benedict was an extremely dark color, almost brown. Definitely not worth the 11 dollars I spent, I passed up 2 or 3 decent breakfast restaurants for that mess. Last time I ever visit that diner."}
{"text":"Great service and food, the portions are huge, and the fresh squeezed orange juice is great. It's very busy in the morning but is worth  the wait."}
{"text":"Overall good breakfast but could use more variety on the breakfast menu. Service was good. Kid friendly and food came out quickly. I would go back again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Just stopped there after spending the night in Vegas. On a Road trip.  Looks like a lot of locals there.  Breakfast was really good. Coffee was very good. Waitresses were terrific. Comfortable booths.   Excellent stop."}
{"text":"My husband frequented \"The Bear\" when he first moved here without me, and we've been a couple times since I joined him.  However, I must say that the other evening, we ate at Black Bear, Gilbert and I had one of the best rib eyes I have ever tasted! Tender, juicy, and cooked a perfect med. rare; enough fat to flavor, but none of the chewy mass I often get at higher end restaurants.  The accompanying red-skinned mashed potatoes and grilled veggies were just right and not too heavy.  Everyone is considerate and friendly (they made an effort to seat us away from a large group of children, even though we were unaware) and service is great here; we enjoy the atmosphere, reading the menu/history, and the overall \"vibe\".  And of course, we enjoy taking home a heaping portion of bread pudding and sauce for a treat later in the evening!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing feels like mothers homemade cooking. Atmosphere and decor makes you feel like your on a camping trip which is a nice change of pace. I'll definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I am giving one star only because the manager graciously took half off of the bill for our horrible experience.

After a long day we got around to thinking about dinner late. We arrived at 9:50 pm. This shouldn't have been a problem since according to Yelp, they close at 11:00 pm. 

STRIKE 1 - When we walked in, half of the restaurant was already shut down. 
STRIKE 2 - The booth we were seated in was so close to the table across the aisle we could hear them breathe. STRIKE 3 - There were only 3 servers, one of which stayed at the counter despite there being no paying customers there. So, the busser took out drink order and brought them out to us.  
STRIKE 4 - My fries were cold. I didn't feel comfortable asking for freshly made fries since I saw the cook staff braking down the kitchen and I'm almost certain that process involves chemicals I'd rather not have mixed into my food. 
STRIKE 5 - We learned they close at 10pm as the table behind us complained to the waitress then the manager about cold food, poor ambience, and severely lacking customer service. 

In all, this place may be good at other times of the day. According to the manager, business dies down around 7:30 - note to self, come before then."}
{"text":"Coming from NY, diners are a mainstay.  Basically they are family restaurants with monsterous selections of both comfort food and complex offerings as well.  Here in AZ, it seems the the word diner means 50's style retro restaurant (life 5 & Diner).

Walking into the Black Bear Diner, I had high expectations, great interior a moderate selection of food, but still the retro 50's selection.  Boy was I disappointed.  First my hamburger was only adequate, and my son's chicken nuggets were store bought frozen food as well as the smiley fries that came with it that he doesn't like.  As well as the wait time for the food, was unreasonable.  So such a long wait for crappy food is not a good experience make.

The ambiance is nice but with such poorly prepared food and horrible wait times, it makes it hard to want to return."}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place. The reviews raved about the chicken fried steak. However, I had a horrible experience there. It might be because I went there at 5, and they weren't prepped for dinner yet?  My friend ordered the stuffed chicken and I ordered the chicken fried steak. They just ran out of soup, and since we were both in the mood for New England Clam Chowder, we opted to wait 15 minutes. They brought us coffee that we didn't order. We didn't get any of our food because we chose to wait for the soup. My friend had ordered onion rings, which we hoped they would bring early, but alas they did not. Her stuffed chicken was dry and lukewarm. My chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes were lukewarm as well. The steak was crunchy and it might have been better if it were steaming hot. The waitress ending up forgetting about the onion rings which were amazing. They were hot and crunchy and delicious! I only wish the rest of my meal was just as amazing. 

For our dessert, we ordered the bread pudding and the chocolate lava cake- both a la mode. However, they premake the dessert, leave it on display, and warm it up.  The cake was kind of dry. The bread pudding was pretty yummy. 

We both signed up on yelp to become a member to get a free coffee and bear claw. However, neither of us got the e-mail which isn't this store's fault, but a fault of yelp?

Two tables came in after us and we left later than them. I understand that we opted to wait for our soup. However, we spent two hours in that diner!"}

{"text":"almost  every  Sunday morning  you  can find  my  family  of  four  here  for  breakfast,  the  service is  always  great.  they  are  almost always sure  to  be  busy  but  never have  to  wait  to  long  for a  booth  and I  love the  fact they  always  try  to  get me a  booth,  since I  have  two  kids,  without  nee  even having  to  ask!  the  crew  always  remembers  us  and  are  super  friendly  with the  kids.  the  atmosphere  is fun  and  comfortable.  and  the  food  is  always  good.  thanks  you  guys  for  making a  place  for  family's  to  dine  :)  you've  done a  great  job!"}
{"text":"Waking up to a completely rainy and wet day in Vegas and having a rental car led the hubby and I to want to venture off the Strip in search of good affordable breakfast--enter the Black Bear Diner.  After finding a thread where everyone was raving about this place, I knew we had to visit.  It reminds you of a great local joint where people visit frequently.  It's your typical at home \"local\" diner feel with all the bear chatskis that you could want.  Though we did not have our little one with us on this trip all the kids appeared to receive a balloon tied to their wrists.  It had a great family vibe to it.  The food was great--delicious, affordable, and huge portions.  The hubby and I wound up sharing the Grizz and it was more than enough food to fill the tummies full.  If we are ever in Vegas again, I know this will be our repeat breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! Service was great. Seating comfortable. Service kind and courteous. Food was great!! I wish I would have taken a pic of our food. I ordered the sourdough Parmesan grilled burger. Cooked perfectly. I ordered the fries...great. Side of ranch was tasty. My partner in crime ordered the HUGE burger which looked delicious and he said it was. We will definitely be back. I have to check out the breakfast."}
{"text":"A little of a wait but well worth it. Big servings and fresh ingredients. The staff was busy but attentive."}
{"text":"Always great food. Light crispy batter on the fish. Plenty of tarter sauce and malt vinegar on the side."}
{"text":"We recently had breakfast at Black Bear.  After a prompt seating, Darian showed up with hot coffee and a beautiful smile.  He knew the menu well and we quickly placed our order (only thing missing on the menu is grits!).  Our food came quickly, huge portions, and tasted delicious.  I was not fond of the biscuit  - too large and too bland - next time I'll order toast.  The chicken apple sausage was excellent.  Darian checked on our table several times during the meal, presented our check promptly and got us on our way.  A delightful dining experience.  (And the bathroom was immaculate.)  Definitely recommend this diner for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Most amazing breakfast ever!!! They're super busy on weekends, suggest calling ahead of time to hold a spot on the waiting list. Their biscuits and gravy are awesome and the pancakes... Yummm!!!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive neighborhood diner environments are so rare here in the Valley of the Mega Chain.  And yes, Black Bear is kind of a chain -- but compared to the dreary suburban factory that is Cracker Barrel, this place feels like it really is involved in a community.  And the food is VASTLY better than any Cracker Barrel, AND the staff, at least anytime I've gone here to the Bell Rd. location, really acts as if it is enjoying their job.  I love this place so much!  It just feels like home!"}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. The waitress loses tickets and makes you wait 30-45 minutes before she realizes your ticket was lost. Do not plan on coming here if you're hungry and expect actual good service."}
{"text":"Yummy fresh, not canned homemade food. Big portion size plates, pot pies are delicious, homemade biscuits.  Would go here then IHOP or village inn"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and they were pretty busy.I ordered the fried chicken which cost fifth teen dollars.I was sadly disappointed.It probally had been cooked before I ordered it it was fried twice.What makes a cook think that people want bad food.I won't go back."}
{"text":"As a tourist, we depend on accurate websites to choose where we spend our money. We took a taxi here from our hotel, a $26 ride, only to find out IT IS CLOSED FOR RENOVATION. THANKS FOR UPDATING GOOGLE MAPS!!Don't spend your hard earned money here because they obviously do not care about informing the public about their closures."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. The food was fine. Someone was vacuuming the whole time. We are still not sure why...it felt like a place where damned souls go to await judgement. My mouth still tastes like onions."}
{"text":"1st time here and I'm glad I found it.  Food is good and our server Marlene is the best.  Closing for renovation so we'll be back after April 1st!"}
{"text":"I been eating breakfast once a week here for two years. I like that they're pretty consistent with the food and service."}
{"text":"Their corporate office in California cares about customer service.  They responded within days of my visit and have sent me a voucher for a free meal the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Looks like a great new breakfast spot. I'm not sure is they were understaffed or just inexperienced? The food was delivered to the table and at that point my mother in law was told her order was unavailable and she would have to choose something else, she had to sit and watch us eat so our food would not get cold. The wait for refills on drinks was slow and I felt the waiter, who was very nice, did not check on the table enough. The food was excellent and for the price the portions are very large. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner and the service was amazing.  Seated quickly our server was busy and several other servers came over to help with drinks and suggestions.  Had the Chicken Fried Steak and the wife had the French Dip which of couse I had to try.
Looked at the breakfast menu and we went back on Sunday for breakfast.  Possibly the best pancakes I have ever eaten and they were my wifes.   I had the Southern Scamble it was amazing, coykd the biscuits be amy bigger. The servings are HUGH, not often I can't finish a meal but both dinner and breakfast was more than I could eat.  We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Honestly, this was a big disappointment. I have been eying this place for a long time and just finally decided to try it. In my opinion it was just a waste of money. I can say that the atmosphere is really cute, the food is hot and the service was good, but that's about it. My husband and I both got the burger baskets. The burgers were decent but nothing spectacular. They were juicy, but they lacked flavor and tasted just like a burger that anyone can make at home. The fries were pretty good though. The bacon on my husband's burger tasted sour like it was old. Maybe some of the other food is awesome, but for the high price I don't think I'll chance going back again."}
{"text":"I came in this morning with my boyfriend for the first time after hearing amazing reviews, and was served by William. 
We got our drinks from the busser right away, but had a bit of a wait for our server to approach us. 

Once we got our food, I asked for a refill on water.. Yet didn't receive that until we asked for our bill.

I ordered a cheeseburger and fries, and he ordered a chicken fried steak. Both entrees came out cold, and we were going to ask for them to be reheated, yet we didn't see the server again for at least 15 minutes.

He never checked on us, asked how our food was, or refilled coffee and water. 

We decided to just eat our cold food and ask for the bill the next chance we got.

I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This was my first time at their new location, the service was great and the staff was extremely friendly. I tried their bear choice with the choice of waffles and it was so delicious! Great spot for breakfast, lunch,or dinner with really great prices and amazing desserts that you can take to go!"}
{"text":"Family's first time here. Tried it out on our drive home. We had to wait a little while for our food and it was lukewarm. It tasted alright. Our server was friendly."}
{"text":"service was great.  our waitress mama T took care of us.  Meatloaf was very good.  Rest of the food was only so-so.  Will try again to see if it was just a one time thing."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service and reasonable prices. Awesome, this is the kind of American business and work ethic I grew up on. Someone gets it! Great Management too. Firm but polite to staff. They all seem to work together well. You can't tell that this location has only been open a couple of months."}
{"text":"Great breakfast every time.  Whenever I am really hunger in the morning I head over to the Black bear for breakfast or brunch.  The French toast (or freedom toast) is cooked and egged just right.  They also use real maple syrup. The staff is always friendly and responsive."}
{"text":"One of the greatest dining experiences I have ever had. Anthony and Marlene were the kindest people and their service was amazing! I loved every minute I was there."}
{"text":"This my second time here, once for breakfast and once for dinner. Service moved a lot slower then the first visit, drinks came quickly but we waited a long time to put in our order. This did not appear due to business demands because they were not extremely busy, we were seated immediately. The food was good and they were large sized portions. There are other similar restaurants in town I like better but this is closer and still really good food. I would recommend against the tri tip dip sandwich.  It seemed a little light on the meat and I have had much better. The Chicken Fried Steak is really good and their Corn Bread is the best."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had breakfast here this morning. It is usually a pretty good and convenient place to pick up a home style breakfast but today \"not so much\". To start the waitress brought us water in dirty water glasses. The waitress brought me another glass of water which a little later I realized later that the glass also had old crusted food particles on it as well.  Then I ordered a medium rear New York Steak and eggs and my daughter ordered the triple bacon club. The waitress brought me a bloody rear Steak  and my daughter's club sandwiches had a hair in it. We both excepted new plates of food because we had been to Black Bear several times and the food was amazing so we did not want to totally throw in the towel on the place. By this time I brought the issue up to the manager. Hoping that whatever was going on in the kitchen could come to a stop after his intervention. Our food came back with almost no issues.  My daughter's club was perfect and tasted great but unfortunately my Steak was awful. It had absolutely no flavor and tasted dry, for a medium rear steak that's usually hard to do. I had to drown it in there Steak sauce to even eat it. The Steak sauce was great. So back to the water glass.  I was unaware that during my second discovery of the the dirty glass that the manager had observed my dismay. He immediately came over to the table, apologized and brought me a fresh glass with great tasting cold water.  We are finally through our meal when another manager comes to the table with our bill. He took off my daughter's club sandwich.  I was not expecting that at all. And yes we still tipped the waitress very well. I applaud today's manager's. Thank you. Unfortunately I have to give Black Bear Diner a 2 finger up wave."}
{"text":"Great food and service, beats the hotel prices and personalities. Easy drive from the casino area. Large parking area for you small Rv's."}
{"text":"We go to Black Bear Diner every week. The food is always delicious, but we mainly go because we love our waitress, Marlene! She know exactly what we want, she takes excellent care of us, and she makes it worth the drive across town to dine! Yay, Marlene!!! 
Yet another wonderful experience at Black Bear with our fave waitress, Marlene! Best service ever...always with a smile! she is worth the drive across town, even though we gave several Black Bears much closer to home!  (Food was great, too!!)"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time during Fish Fry Friday. I hate fish, so I passed on the fish. I had pancakes, eggs and hashbrowns. It was pretty good but nothing to write home about. There were a number of entrees that I was interested in so next time I will try one of them. My boyfriend enjoyed his fish and had two plates full. I ate his hush puppies (REALLY yummy) and some of his fries. The one thing I was really disappointed about was the pie. I got the chocolate pie. The crust was disgusting. The filling was decent. The whipped topping was mediocre. 

We will likely return for another fish fry friday, but I certainly will not be buying the pie."}
{"text":"I eat at this place at least once every two weeks. Overall I've had good experiences. Recently, I sat at the counter and Brett was my server. He was professional, and courteous with a hint of humor. My food arrived quickly and delicious. I enjoyed the experience that I will more than likely always choose to sit at the counter."}
{"text":"Always come each week for the Scram bowl...it's big enough to fed two, and the sauces are to die for. ;)"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, but I wish I could give this location zero stars for my experience.  

On Father's Day (two weeks ago) my family went to Black Bear Diner to celebrate my Grandfather.  There was a total of five adults and we ended up spending about $50.  The food was absolutely worth the money!  I got \"The Griz\" and it arrived on two gigantic plates filled to the brim.  It tasted great and was satisfying.  We were also celebrating a Birthday in the group and the server brought out a free peach cobbler for her.  

The place was busy and a little messy inside, but this is to be expected on a day like this.  Up until this point, we were having a great time, but going to the restrooms changed everything!

I had to take my very elderly Grandfather to the men's room, where there was what appeared to be a Black Bear Diner worker (wearing one of their shirts) exiting a stall, that was not properly flushed.  There was a second Black Bear Diner worker entering the men's room behind us.  The two workers exchanged fist bumps and words, before the first worker (who just left a used toilet) exited the men's room WITHOUT WASHING HIS HANDS!  I know he didn't wash his hands because since I was holding the door open for my Grandfather, my back was to the sinks and watched him slip right out the door.  

If I did not have to constantly be at my Grandfather's side, i would have followed the worker out of the men's room and confronted him.  To add insult to injury, there is a sign next to the sinks saying employees must wash hands.  After exiting the men's room and washing up, we left immediately.  My stomach was churning thinking that this guy might have handled food without having clean hands.  As we left, a worker at the front desk was notified and she said she would take care of it.  

I left an email that night with the main email address for Black Bear Diner and the Gilbert store.  After one week, I did not have any response, so I went to Facebook, where they finally responded.  I ended up speaking to a very nice lady at the Black Bear Diner headquarters.  However, since this location is a franchise store, it seems that headquarters cannot do much.  I told the lady at their headquarters to pass along my contact info to the Gilbert store.  It has been two weeks since the visit and have not heard anything from the Gilbert store.  

The best food in the world can not make up for a worker not washing their hand after using the restroom."}
{"text":"So, there we were...three couples, all seniors. Three of us are easygoing, the other three are varying degrees of fussy/demanding. We had all been to the Tropicana location, but we wanted to try the new one. When we arrived, we were pleasantly greeted, led to our table, and given menus.

Very soon after, a server took our drink order and it arrived rather quickly. All correctly, too. Our principal server, a young woman named
Saerae, took our dinner orders (this was a Sunday evening), and she 
very efficiently fielded the many extra requests we old folks are known for. Lots of extra napkins, \"Tabasco, please\",  lemons, a glass of ice,
more lemons...more bread, butter, and did I mention more lemons?

Before our meals arrived, the manager came to our table and told us 
that the mixed vegetables we ordered would have to be substituted,
and would we be OK with salads? Happily, we were all more than OK
with that. Then the meals arrived. The soups were tasty and hot, the 
salads crispy and cold, and the entrees delicious. Both Saerae and
another server returned the table to fill glasses, bring bread, etc.

Three of us ordered turkey, and it was perfect...garlic mashed REALLY
good. One ordered tri-tip and was glad he did. One ordered an omelet
and said it was \"out of this world\", and the last two ordered chicken
and said they loved it.

So, there you have it. Really good food, GREAT service, nice, simple
surroundings.  This was a good night for this new location, and for us.

PS. Please give special shout out to our amazing waitress, Saerae."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal!!! We drive past this place every single day and never stop. Today we had a taste for something different and I believe we've found our new favorite breakfast joint!

We came in at about 11:00 AM on a Saturday. There was about a 15 min wait. Summer (waitress) was really friendly, welcoming, and even teased us a bit. Our food was brought out piping hot within about 5 min!!! And it was delicious! Huge portions without a huge price. The food was excellent and well worth the 15 min wait. I encourage everyone to give this joint a try."}
{"text":"This is by far the best breakfast in town! There is always a wait but it is worth it. The service is always great, food comes quick and is delicious. I love the California benedict and my husband likes chicken fried steak. 

I would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Normally we have breakfast here, but we got up a little late so thought we'd give them a try for lunch. It was packed as usual but we got a nice booth and didn't wait too long. We were given our drink order right away and our food arrived on time. My boyfriend got the triple stack blt and I had the California burger. 

I think they confused triple bacon with triple bread. There was only 3 pieces of bacon on the triple decker club style sandwich. On the plus side, his potato salad was excellent. 

My cheeseburger, which came with half a head of lettuce and half of a tomato had a quarter size spot of shredded unmelted cheese on it, hidden under a salad. The burger was cooked correctly and it was tasty, it just wasn't a cheeseburger. 

After we were finished eating we waited about 15 minutes before our waitress appeared to ask if we wanted boxes for the pile of uneaten bread on my bf's plate. We got our check and went to pay. The girl at the counter was talking to two other waitresses. I said hello and handed her my check. She completely ignored me grabbing my bill and card off the counter and continued to talk to the other girls. Not once did she tear away from her conversation or even glance in my direction while flinging my card and receipt on the counter. 

Really Black Bear? Is it really that difficult to find a better hostess? It'll be a long time before we come back, and it's because of her, not to mention you're charging $9 for untoasted white bread and lettuce. Perhaps janelle would be better suited at busing tables or washing dishes, since she obviously doesn't understand that being a hostess/greeter means you actually have to greet people."}
{"text":"Three and a half stars really.  Had the hobo omlette.  Strangely the ingredients are not fried into the egg.  It's like the egg portion is fried separately and then rolled up around the ingredients.  So anyhow the omlette was good but not great.  Mr. Mom's serves up an omlette which is awesome.  The black bear fresh fruit was excellent - nearly the best I've found except for The Daily Egg which also adds kiwi to their fresh fruit so I'd slightly prefer that one.  The entire waitress staff was the most impressive I've seen at any diner - absolutely great!!!  Our server April was simply a pleasure."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a couple of times and have loved it. The corned beef hash was great. The stuffed chicken was really good. The chicken fried steak was good.....until this last time. All of the sides were really good (potatoes, eggs, biscuits) but they burnt the breading on the chicken fried steak. It was dry and had a overcooked taste to it. Everyone else at the table loved their meal, and I've had their chicken fried steak before and it tasted fine. It was just a mistake on the kitchen staff, but that doesn't mean I won't come back again. 

Service was friendly and fast - even though they were very busy. Portion sizes are big, so will will probably have left overs. They also have a huge menu. The waitress mentioned to us that the whole menu - breakfast, lunch and dinner - is served all day. Unlike their California locations that serve each group separate. She said that Vegas is the only location that does that. So there is a lot of choices. 

Out of all the restaurants we took my mom to in Vegas. This one was her favorite."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!!  I've never been for anything but breakfast, but I have never been disappointed!  There will almost always be a wait on Saturday and Sunday morning, but it is so so so well worth it.  The food is good, service is friendly, and portions are HUGE."}
{"text":"So we brought our kids here for breakfast before hitting the road to Tucson for a college graduation. We were all really pleased with the food. Biscuits were soft and humongous! The pancakes were great, my son said his omelette was delicious. The wait time was short and the waitress was on top of things. Overall it was an above average experience and I can't wait to go back again. If it's just as good of an experience I will probably put up an extra star."}
{"text":"Found this place looking for an alternative to the tourist clogged overpriced restaurants on the strip.  It looked like a roadside diner from my younger days in New York and we decided to try it.  It was after noon but I opted for the hash and eggs breakfast.  The hash is definitely not out of a can.  The corned beef was ample and it wasn't pasty like number 10 can hash.  The eggs were cooked to order and hash browns were the wide shredded style and NOT over cooked!!  I also liked that the food wasn't over salted in some lame attempt to generate flavor out of a can.  I was able to add salt and pepper to my taste.
Our server was great. It was crowded, not packed, and she took good care of us.  The food arrived soon after we ordered, it was hot and more than enough to fill you up.  The prices were reasonable and a lot better than the $3.50 hotel Starbucks tall coffee I had this morning
We had to head back to the conference, and I admired the pies on the way out.  We didn't have time for dessert however the manager boxed one for us.  We enjoyed the banana cream pie the next day waiting on the TSA line.  That started a few conversations with our fellow travelers!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast twice during my most recent visit to LV and I will be returning next time in LV.  Orange juice squeezed in house, good coffee and tasty pancakes.  The corned beef hash is incredible.  Waitresses were attentive and friendly.

Load up with a big breakfast and you can skip lunch to spend more time in the casino."}
{"text":"So good! Great atmosphere, good service, and wonderful food, coffee, and orange juice.  Another chain we don't have in the Midwest, so I never miss a chance to visit!"}
{"text":"I had lunch there and the staff wasnt rude but they weren't attentive either , me and a friend went and she ordered a chicken salad, and I had a grilled cheese sandwich. First off the bread on on sandwich was so hard it stabbed into the roof of my mouth when I bit down. Second my friends chicken salad looked very appetizing, until she took a bite of the chicken, it was nothing but hard cold grissel. She looked thru the rest and it was all fat cold hard grissel chunks. When we told the waitress that she didnt want it and to bring the menu back so we could order something else she walked away and didnt return. We sat there for 15 minutes I figured she got busy, but when we called her to the table and asked what happened she just said \"with what I don't understand\" I was so pissed I got up and started walking out the front door when the hostess stopped me and said \" ma'am you haven't paid your bill\" Are you freaking kidding me I said we didnt eat our food we sent it back And your waitress never came back to retake our order and walked out.  I won't be going back to that place."}
{"text":"So much food so good :) couldn't finish all my food but didn't want to stop eating lol nice and friendly staff  manger came over to table to great us and asked if everything was fine"}
{"text":"Great comfort food!!  The decor is great. So many bears. Really cute. Went on a Tuesday which was free meal for children night. There were 6 adults and 1 child in our party. Arrived after 6 pm. Waited 15 minutes to get a large table. As soon as I saw chicken pot pie on the menu, I knew what I was having. Then again, there was meatloaf and chicken fried steak. So many comfort foods. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I want to give them 5 stars. But, a couple of things have made it only 3. The food tastes great. The portions are ample. The prices are at the higher end for this type of food, but the portions kind of make up for that. I sometimes work nights, so it is nice to go there with my wife in the morning and she can have breakfast while I have dinner.

The first time I went, it was worthy of 5 stars. The second visit was pretty good, but when I asked for their advertised dessert specialty, the banana split pie, I was told, \"We have sold the last one and he (whoever that is) is not going to make any now.\"  WTF

The 3rd time and possibly the last time I was there Saturday, April 23, not only were they out of the same dessert, but also they were out of Balsamic salad dressing. I'm sorry to seem nit-picky, but running out of things is simply poor management. They are open 16 hours per day, every day, for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It's not like things will go to waste.

Now, if this was it, I would be at 4 stars, except the following issue is why I give only 3.

This is a big restaurant with a lot of tables. The table service is pretty top-notch. WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU HAVE YOUR GUEST'S LAST MEMORY BE STANDING IN LINE TO PAY? There is only one cash register for everyone paying. The first trip I had to wait while the person ahead of me had a credit card issue delaying the whole line, then the cashier answered the phone delaying me another 2 minutes while the line to pay grew behind me. The 2nd and 3rd times I had less of a wait, but it was frustrating...no one likes to stand in lines.

Take a cue from Chili's and Olive Garden and get the pay-at-the-table kiosks. That is how you run a restaurant in 2015 and beyond. At least go to server based payment and you will be running a restaurant like 1996. The way you are running it now is simply out of touch with current trends and guest services."}
{"text":"Everytime I move into a new area I go on the hunt for home cookin. Especially breakfast, my fav meal. Me & a buddy driving Baseline looking for such a restaturant pulled into BBD last week & I've already been back.

Not only huge portions but tasty. Where can you get Steak & Eggs, taters & huge biscuit for 6.99 w/ an actual steak on the plate full of flavor?  Those in my party loved the eggs benedict, scrambles and the huge pancakes.

Bob the GM is a good guy w/ loads of customer svc. Ricki our server was a hoot after picking up on my oneriness."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here after a very long day at work. He had been talking about this place for months and I had never been so I had some high expectations. I had ordered a pasta and an Ice tea while my husband had ordered a coffee and the New York Steak. 
The pasta was disgusting and I found hair that did not belong to me and the tea tasted old.
The steak that my husband ordered was rare when he ordered a medium rare, the onion rings that come with the steak weren't on his plate and the vegetables that he had, he wouldn't even touch. I took a bite of the vegetables and I had to spit it out in a napkin. I asked for a to go box for my pasta because I was still going to eat it but now I am just so disgusted and I am probably going to make myself sick.
I will never come here again not even if I was bribed with free food and money."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best restaurant in this city and yes thats VEGAS/HENDERSON hands down. Amazing service from start to finish .. greeted as soon as you walk in to the server and completely hands on caring. The food is terrific large portions well worth the price. Iv been in this town for 20yrs and this is the best service i have ever had. And no im not an employee. Its very hard to find genuine customer service where your server actually looks you in the eyes  greets you smiles and also hears you out knows the menu with plenty of knowledge and reads your order back to you that right there blew me away put a smile on my face. Definitely the place to dine and eat anytime. Greatest food place ever."}
{"text":"Came here hungry for breakfast - only waited about 30 min for a table (on a Sunday morning). Everyone from the hostess to the servers were extremely friendly and attentive.  The oj was fresh squeezed - delicious!  And the pancakes were huge!  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We checked this place out based on the yelp reviews and because it always seems busy. I can see why. They have good food for a great price. You can honestly share your food with another person and have plenty. My only complaint was they seemed a bit unorganized at the front desk. You pay & check in up there - it was constantly chaotic. With that said, we will still go back."}
{"text":"I was pretty satisfied with Black Bear, the food was great. The wait staff was quick, attentive, and enthusiastic. Be warned though the portions are pretty big. My only gripe was that i wasnt  a fan of their sausage or hashbrowns, they weren't bad just not my style."}
{"text":"I ordered eggs, bacon, hash browns, and a biscuit. They brought back a plate filled with large portions of each and everything tasted great! I also had a side of the country potatoes and those were flavorful as well! To drink, I had orange juice which was freshly squeezed and homemade! Good, but a little warmer than I would have liked. Overall, it was a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Super kid friendly. The menu is huge and food yummy... I'm a bit if a breakfast snob but this place definitely passed the test. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Wait time 10 min. Not bad. Took 15 min before wait staff even acknowledged us. Food was great."}
{"text":"We stopped here on a Sunday morning while traveling after reading reviews on Yelp.  What a fantastic breakfast. The service was great and the servers were all a lot of fun. And my Shasta Scramble was excellent. I wish I'd ordered it without onions but that was my mistake.  The hash browns were excellent, the scramble yummy and the biscuit was huge and delicious. I hilly recommend the Black Bear.  And I'd you're coming on a Sunday, come early!  We arrived around 8:30 and were seated right away, but when we left about 9:15, people were waiting for tables.  5 stars for sure"}
{"text":"Pretty standard breakfast spot.  Not that that's a bad thing, that might be what you're looking for.  They have everything you would expect: pancakes, omelettes, waffles, french toast.  I had two pancakes with eggs and bacon.  The pancakes were almost the size of a plate and I'm glad I only ordered two, they were filling.  They had a nice crust from the griddle and were fluffy inside.  The eggs and bacon were cooked properly.  It was a perfectly acceptable meal."}
{"text":"Marlene the PM Supervisor is great!  Service with a smile and friendly conversation.  The food is good, the service is great!  It's a winning combo for a home style meal I don't have to cook."}
{"text":"I ordered the southern scramble with hash browns and a side of sourdough toast. It. Was. AMAZING.  The harsh browns were perfect! Crunchy and some how creamy. Fantastic!  The gravy, Perfect!  The best bacon I've had.  The only thing wrong with my food was I thought the sausage was peppered a little too much other than that the food was perfect.  The atmosphere is very cozy and comfy.  Bears everywhere. It feel like you're in woods somewhere in CA. I love it. Makes me miss home. They have a juke box that plays oldies which fits perfectly. The staff was very friendly and nice. The food came out in a pretty decent time.   Overall I had an amazing time here and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"My kids love eating breakfast here.  My youngest loves to take pictures with the wooden carved bears that greet you in front of the restaurant.   

The name of this eatery is very fitting especially for people who have a big bear appetite, you never leave hungry.  They are generous with their servings.  I have tried their breakfast burrito, Benedict, skillets, omelette and waffles.  I have never been disappointed with taste and presentation.  They know how to dish out the  best hash brown, I love the crunch and texture of the potatoes.  It's not mushy like most restaurants, because sadly, other places don't season the hash well like Black Bear. 

The service is always excellent, the servers always checks in to make sure our needs are met, and I was impressed that the manager is actively on the floor greeting patrons and helping the servers when they are busy.   Just a tip, we try to dine in before 7:30am on Sunday morning to beat the hungry masses that start coming in after 8am."}
{"text":"Mindy is an amazing person. The best server here!

The food was amazing, I haven't had real country style since 2005. The waffles and pancakes are amazing. So much food. We will defiantly return. If.you come ask to have Mindy :-)"}
{"text":"We had a great time our server Chris was super nice and knowledgeable about the menu."}
{"text":"When my friends and I went we were seated very quickly. However, once seated, it was a whole other story. It took thirty five minutes for someone to take our order and the restaurant was not that busy. That was annoying. Then my food was not that good. I got the corn beef hash and it had no flavor. I hated it. Customer service was good but we had to wait a long time to get the bill and it was just an ok experience... Coffee was amazing though. Other then that, it was not the best and i probably won't go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing with it customer service and it's great tasting food.
 
I had the chicken fried steak and eggs with bistcut and gravy....Feel good meal....

Big parking lot...."}
{"text":"Serves all kinds of typical American breakfast food. I had the homemade corned beef hash and a huge glass of orange juice for around $15"}
{"text":"Had a very good experience. 
Our waitress Cynthia, was friendly and attentive.
The food was served promptly and everything to our liking."}
{"text":"Most awesome breakfast place. Portions are huge! My husband and I always split a meal. My teenage son actually gets full. There is usually a wait but it is well worth it.  Pancakes are a hit and get a bear claw to go. Makes a great breakfast the next day."}
{"text":"My girlfriend came yesterday and brought home a peach pie because she knows i love it, she heard it was the best and want me to try it, when she came home later in the evening after lunch. It was peaches in the bottem of a tin case with a layer of crust which was light and very undone that covered the lonely peaches and a whole lot of air in between the peaches and plain crust, ive never been to this place but im not interested in trying, had to get this off my chest."}
{"text":"Perhaps the perfect diner. I recommend everything, especially the biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"First time having breakfast here. Would definitely recommend it! We had a party of nine and they got is in no problem. Very reasonable prices and some of the best biscuits I have had in a very long time. I would drive past 5 cracker barrels to eat here! Service was excellent and the coffee was great too. Gonna have to try lunch here next..."}
{"text":"I Love This place come here every Sunday for their food customer service is always great and respectful that waitress Kenie took care of us  this morning always on point. She made sure we were satisfied"}
{"text":"Consistently good breakfast here no matter what you order ....never had a bad meal here ...great staff, food and priced right ...no doubt will never hesitate suggesting this place !"}
{"text":"we came here for breakfast. The food was great. the service was awesome. we will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"We are always SO happy with this little place :)  It's my daughter's favorite luch spot (she's ten) and my parents love to come here when they visit from out of town.  I can say I've never had a bad experience.  It is all that a diner should be...cute, comfortable, homey and good."}
{"text":"I was at Black Bear today with a group and when I didn't get my order in over AN HOUR, yup --  60 minutes -- despite two pleas to the server, I got up to talk to the manager. 

By this time, most everybody in my party had finished and the waitress was cleaning up. I went over to the counter and could see in the kitchen that the staff looked grim and super stressed out. There wasn't a smile for miles.

The manager offered no excuses or apology as he emerged from the kitchen - just a 'Yeah, what? I told the manager what was going on and wondered aloud what was going on. \"I am beginning to wonder if I have to go to Taco Bell to pick up something to eat.\"  

He said, \"Then why don't you?\"

Wrong answer.

My husband went to go talk to the guy afterward, and the manager stood his ground and said I was rude.

Me? Seriously?

If he couldn't offer a simple apology or explanation, then you should know that his crappy attitude is rubbing off on all of the staff, and these are the people making you something to eat. Is that yummy???

Black Bear Diner has a pretty big menu for a diner but you'll get an unexpected side of  \"I don't give a s**t\" with your meal. 

Ya know, there are just so many other places to get lunch at that I don't see any reason to go there again, ever."}
{"text":"My first time here at the black bear diner the entire atmosphere is appealing,cozy and comforting,with a above and beyond attitude with the service staff. Our steak & eggs were cooked to perfection. Juicy and very well seasoned delicacy, that we will continue to return again for."}
{"text":"Went here on a vacation.  We have been to the st George location often and liked this one as well. I really like it. I recommend their breakfast."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place b/c of the reviews on yelp and we were looking for a great breakfast place past 10am. Everyone was very nice and it was packed on a Friday at 11am, which was a good sign. The hubby and I had the chicken fried steak and eggs and the kids (off the regular menu) had the ham and cheese omelet & the eggs Benedict. You must try the biscuit which was awesome. The next time we are in Vegas we will stop in here again- it was close enough to the freeway to be our last stop before heading home!"}
{"text":"We loved this place when it opened. Friendly service, good food. However, the service has struggled. We support local businesses so we hung in there through their growing pains. Tonight is final straw, 15 minutes and to get place order, twice we got up to remind her to come. One hour later, no food. We got up and asked many other severs that didn't help. Our server seemed to like to chat with other tables. After noticing part of our food under warmer for 10 mins, I ask. They tell me not all done and they are busy! They absolutely were not. Server never asked if our children wanted their food under warmer for now 20 mins. We finally ask for manager. Nine comes. We get up to go and I see her get my food out of microwave to say she's bringing mine, kids food still under warmer. We decided to go. But not before the \"manager\" told me I was unreasonable and could take my business elsewhere. We left at 7:45pm with hungry child."}
{"text":"Great to have another  Black Bear Diner so close by. Open now for about 2 weeks. Food is excellent, crew is wonderful. Shandi has waited on us twice now. Personality plus and very good service."}
{"text":"Should have know better and ordered the chicken fried steak. Got chicken parm and it wasnt good at all. It had no flavor and the chicken was burnt. I've had better at a buffet. I gave it 2 stars cause my wife liked her BLT. I have been there a few times and really liked their CFS, but this visit I was very dissapointed. The service was fine though. Live and learn."}
{"text":"I'm from Northern California and always seen them around but never went in and I'm extremely upset I hadn't. I ask the lady friend if she wanted to try it out and I went two days in a row! You want some good food this place is on point!"}
{"text":"Black Bear Diners (all of them) have declined from 5 Stars to 2 Stars over time.
in the 1990's and early 2000's (2000-2006) food was tasty and prices super
reasonable. Today, Black Bear Diners are much higher priced and the food
is rather tasteless. If you are starving and nothing else is close by you can go
in and eat a very average meal at a slightly higher price than it deserves. BUT, if
you prefer to shop around in Las Vegas, I'd recommend Mimi's Café, Mr. Mamas,
IHOP, or any hotel coffee shop as a better alternative."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Huge portions and friendly wait staff. Favorite for breakfast! I dare you to do it! I have moved from here since then, and I miss it, but I will sometimes make the trip up there for the great food :)"}
{"text":"We were in Las Vegas trying to get off the main drag when we stumbled upon Black Bear Diner. We were starving and decided to head in after reading a few reviews. Our waitress, Marlene, was extremely friendly and helped us decide what to eat.  She proved excellent service, was cheerful and a great asset to Black Bear Diner! Our food WS delicious!!"}
{"text":"Typical diner. Food was decent. Service was fast. But nothing special about black bear.

Update: I returned to the diner this evening with my family for Sunday dinner. We were less than pleased. My eggs and potatoes tasted like canola oil and my fruit bowl was subpar at very best, clearly not fresh. My sisters sandwich had little to no avocado and white American cheese instead of pepper jack. My dad, a big omelet lover, ordered a spinach, onion, and jalapeño omelet. What a disaster that was. Firstly, they do not have jalapeños despite the fact that I could throw a jar through the front door from the grocery store in the same parking lot. Then when the omelet arrived it was nothing more than a sheet of egg folded over with the onion and spinach sloped on top. No cheese, he hadn't asked for cheese because we were all under the impression that cheese came with omelets as a pretty main component of such a dish. We won't be back to black bear, disappointing since my dad really was a fan of this place for quite sometime."}
{"text":"This place has huge portions! The environment is nice with a lot of wood details and a theme of a log cabin mountain place. They have their logo of a bear on just about every product and cuff and all sorts of condiments with that logo. The food was good but not great. if you like large portions of food I would highly recommend this place. Keep in mind, if you order pancakes they are bigger than the size of your head."}
{"text":"Im a vegetarian and so i was a little worried about finding a decent meal but they had a garden burger which was to die for. I like the seasoning they have on their fries because it taste like Red Robin. I also had an oreo milkshake ( yeah i know, there goes my \"diet\") and it wasnt anything special just a regular shake. But the place is super cute. It has newspaper menus which i think is creative!! I will def go back again."}
{"text":"Good solid diner. Great service. Went for Saturday breakfast, fresh squeezed OJ was fantastic, food was good but nothing spectacular. Eggs benedict was overcooked (one of my pet peeves) and omelette was flat and a little greasy. Still beats anyplace on the strip, though."}
{"text":"I have always been a big fan of Black Bear. If you are into home-style diner cooking this is the place for you. I have rarely finished a meal there, which is not a bad thing since I love leftovers. The menu is huge, the portions are huge but the cost is reasonable. 

This place smokes Denny's for breakfast and they put IHOP's pancakes to shame.  I have eaten at black bear too many times to count but occasionally I have I had a bad meal at black bear, but that would be 1 out of 100 maybe. 

Worth noting  is the variety of breakfast meats you can get. In addition to the usual bacon, sausage, ham they also serve chorizo, linquica, corned beef, ground beef and tri tip dishes. 

I only have two small nit picks. First I wish they had more then one location in Vegas, (HINT HINT I hope your listening Black Bear, put one up north!). Second I wish they would go back to their old steak fries. What they serve now is just not as good their old ones which were the bomb. Regardless of my small complaints they deserve all 5 stars."}
{"text":"Loved this place, you don't know youre in Vegas when you walk in! Any place that serves breakfast all day is already on the top of my list! I had the sweet cream pancakes, veeeerrrryyyy rich and buttery. You almost don't need syrup with them they're so yummy by themselves. They have another type, almond granola that I'm anxious to try the next time I'm there. The waitress we had was enthusiastic, friendly and talkative and you could tell she loves what she does. My husband had the turkey dinner and it was also delish. The decor is a bit strange with stuffed bears everwhere but oddly endearing. Can't wait to go back to this restaurant! Being from the east coast, (upstate NY) this is something you'd expect to find- we were right at home here!"}
{"text":"First of all, first impressions are EVERYTHING!!  We usually order take-out, the young lady who answered the phone (Sun. 11/19/17) is exceptional.  I forgot to ask her name as she deserves a compliment - an asset to BB!!  The food is always delicious, the portions are huge.  We've never been disappointed.  To top it off, they are within walking distance.  THANK YOU, Black Bear!!"}
{"text":"Black Bear rarely disappoints!  I've been to several in California, and now the Phoenix/Mesa, AZ location. On this occasion I had the Eggs Benedict - California Style with reg. bacon and avocado. Asked for 1 pancake vice potatoes.  It came out in less than 10 minutes, hot, tasty and properly cooked! (eggs were properly poached, hollandaise was spot on - for american cuisine) Looking forward to the next visit!"}
{"text":"Man oh man!!!! Let's start off with Cyndi. She was our server and excellent. I really loved that most of the employees were wearing Cardinals gear. They love their team. The sweet cream waffle is absolutely delicious. The fresh squeezed (sweet) orange juice was mouth watering fantastic. My family and I had no complaints whatsoever. This restaurant has a rustic mountain town feel to it. I will be going to their location in my home state really so"}
{"text":"Food and service were great!!! Our waitress Joanna was the best!!!! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I just had an amazing breakfast! Place was super busy for a Monday morning which is awesome for them, our server Alex was very nice and funny. Definitely would come back it's so good."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast - perfect escape from overpriced Strip food - just 5-10 minutes away from the strip."}
{"text":"I frequent black bear diner daily for breakfast and almost always go for the Acapulco. Where else can you get a healthy omelette with chicken , fruit and an English muffin for under $10. The management and staff go above and beyond here and the banana creme pie is the best I have ever had. I would put it against any dessert at Cheesecake Factory and choose this banana creme pie over it every time. For great service and great health type food go to black bear diner today"}
{"text":"Had a great meal at this diner and an awesome waitress named Spring took care of us    We would definitely go back :)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast stop!  Good service.  The waitress said many on the wait staff have been there 5+ years...some 9+ years.  They have a good manager and the place is fast at getting food to the table even when it's busy.  And it's always busy but that's just because it's so darn good!  If there's just two people I recommend sitting at the counter to avoid the wait.  Happy eating!! :)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Food really good and service prompt/friendly. Went three days in a row on recent trip. Chorizo scramble was fantastic. Minor feeling of being part of a chain, which it is, but just a little.  Really enjoyed and will go back for sure. Also, open at 6 am which is a big plus for me."}
{"text":"Every weekend my husband and I go out to eat breakfast at the same place. This weekend we decided to try something different so we went to Black Bear Diner. From the moment we walked through the doors it was a pleasant experience,  it was packed with people, but we were seated right away. The atmosphere is whimsical with little black bears,  a  vintage looking news paper holds the actual menu inside. And let me tell you, it is a BIG menu (a lot of selections), I had the Shasta scramble, and with my first bite I was saying \"oh my GOODNESS. \" The veggies were FRESH,  I actually tasted the Avocado,  tomato,  onion, spinach, not just egg. The super large home style biscuit was great as well. I don't recall the name of my husband's meal but the  Corned beef hash was not 'hormals' from a can. It was real corned beef they make it themselves.  Long story short  (not) go and check them out."}
{"text":"We have been driving by this place for ages.  We finally stopped in on a Friday after work about 5:30.  The place was half full and we were seated immediately.  We got our drink order right away and then were given our leisure to peruse the menu.  Lots of tempting choices so she had to check back with us a few times until we were ready.  Decisions.....

We ordered the chicken fried steak, and fish and chips.  The chicken  fried steak was crispy (almost too crispy) and flavorful and loaded with gravy.  The potatoes (red skinned mashed) couldn't have been better.  It came with grilled/steamed veggies done just right.  

The fish and chips were moist and flavorful while crispy and not greasy.  The only complaint on the fish and chips was that while the portion served was big, the pieces themselves were smaller than we've had other places.  The french fries looked better than they tasted.  Not crispy enough for us.

We got pie to go.  The chocolate cream pie was a disappointment.  I don't know what they use for the chocolate filling, but it had an odd taste, almost like a cherry liquor maybe?  Anyway, didn't care for it.  For the price, would rather have gone for a Marie Callendar's and had a full pie.  

Will we go back?  Yes, this place has good diner quality food.  The salads served at other tables looked pretty darn good and what looked to be chicken and biscuits at the next table is going to get us back there for sure.  Their meatloaf special and club sandwiches are on the list too.  

Okay, for some real complaints.  There was a burnt on the grill smell in the air when we came in.  Maybe due to the openness of the kitchen to the dining area.  But a little unpleasant.  When we went to pick out our to go dessert and asked what was in the bear claw, the hostess was clueless.   Let us hope she was new.  One of the waitresses popped over however and helped us out.  Brown sugar and cinnamon or plain by the way."}
{"text":"My second visit here and the food and service was great.  Not too far off the strip and worth the short drive to get here.  I had the Chorizo Scramble with tortillas which was excellent.  Service was top notch and our waitress very accommodating.  Get off the strip and have a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"I've always loved this place, but tonight they totally rocked it! It was our daughter's birthday today, she turned 3. The food was great as always, but our server Robby was amazing! My husband tried the fish special which was all you can eat. Robby always made sure our drinks were full and his plate was full. One of the managers, I didn't get his name, stopped by our table and asked our daughter why she was so dressed up. She told him it was her birthday today and she was 3. He told her after she finished her dinner to talk to him and he would give her a pie all her own. She was so excited that she got to pick out her own pie. When she was done he came and got her and let her pick out exactly which pie she wanted. All the staff was so great and told her happy birthday. I love this place and would totally recommend it to everyone. Thank you guy so much for making my baby's birthday rock!!!!"}
{"text":"If you want to eat breakfast in Las Vegas, GO HERE!! It's too good to describe. You will just love it. We found it and ate here everyday we were in Vegas (12).. There are not enough superlatives to say how great it is.. YELP needs another Star for this place."}
{"text":"Was there last night for my Dad's birthday. Great food and large portions"}
{"text":"Mediocre breakfast. California bacon benedict. Avocado nuttiness drowned away by hollandaise. Hash browns not crispy enough. Bacon thick and good. Fruit was pretty legit actually. But the breakfast itself meh.

Breakfast is one of my favorite meals. It's so simple and yet it can be so exciting if executed well. It was with high hopes that I walked through the doors of Black Bear Diner. Upon initially entering the establishment, I was overwhelmed with bears. Bear pictures, bear statues, bear memorabilia everywhere! It was cute and welcoming so I went with it.

Unfortunately, I didn't find the food as charming. I ordered the California bacon benedict. Love benedicts and love bacon. Also love avocado. What can go wrong?

Everything went wrong. Well that's prolly too harsh. It'd be better to say that I was served a plate of mediocrity. The dish was drenched in hollandaise. Soaked the English muffin and made it soggy. Drowned out the nutty buttery flavor of the avocado. And it cascaded through the spinach. Gave it the texture of seaweed. At least it didn't kill the bacon which was cut rather thick and tasty. It didn't taste bad or anything. It just kinda didn't taste like anything. Just very slimy with hollandaise sauce. And the sauce itself was pretty bland too.

Also, a perfect breakfast can quickly go south if the hash browns aren't done right. And to do hash browns right, they need crispiness. The hash browns here are not crisp at all. They were crazy mushy and soft, failing to provide the complimenting crunch that goes so well with the thick strong creaminess of hollandaise over eggs benedict.

But it was served with fresh yummy fruit which was nice I guess!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant before a couple times and had ok experiences.  Both the food and wait staff are decent.  But it's not close to where I live.  

I was surprised to find a Free Entree Coupon in my email recently.  I guess I signed up for their restaurant club and they sent me a coupon for my birthday... how sweet.  

So I decided to place a couple entree orders and pick it up for dinner for myself and my girlfriend, driving out of my way, but hey, a free meal is nice these days.

To my disappointment, the cashier, while checking me out indicates that I can only use my Free Entree Coupon for Dine In.  But that fine print is ultra fine and tiny, on the 3rd line at the very bottom of the email.  

I don't know about you but I am really tired of being TRICKED into visiting an establishment and being forced to partake in a dining experience not of my preference.

It's very easy to be transparent with customers and that is what I appreciate.  Anything else is excruciatingly frustrating.

I can't see returning."}

Food is delicious never had a bad meal!
The best coffee! Biscuits are to die for!!!!"}

{"text":"Came for breakfast at 10am on a Friday. There was no wait.  The waitress was extremely friendly and helpful.  The food was delicious. I ordered the scrambowl with biscuits and gravy, nice portions. I would definitely go back to try lunch and dinner."}

{"text":"My husband and I popped in for brinner. We sat at the bar since there was a wait. The service was fast. We both order two eggs, potatoes and bread. The plate was massive and I took almost half of it home. All that said it was way more expensive than it should have been. I could eat other places that serve large portions for much less. Unfortunately, a lot places that serve breakfast are not open past 2:00. If the undying need for brinner hits me again, I might go back."}
{"text":"This is a great all American diner! I have only been for breakfast. I get the Volcano every time. It is so goooooood! I love the diner setup as well as the selection of pies. I will be going back as much as possible."}
{"text":"I used to really like breakfast and lunch here but after a few years of going here the quality of the food has really gone down, my stuff is either burnt or my eggs are really runny or I get some type of meat on my fruit just seems like something always happens. The customer service has stayed good they always refilling cups and seeing if we need anything else!"}
{"text":"Great food huge portions!! The staff is super friendly and you get free stuff for signing up to their mailing list."}
{"text":"We loved it! There was a great article about the diner in the San Tan News with a couple of coupons so my family decided to give it a try. Service and the food was great! The decorations and layout of the restaurant reminds you of a hunting lodge and the wide choices of \"down home\" types of food was excellent. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and we will return many times. If you haven't been there, give it a try! You will not be sorry!"}

{"text":"This place has huge servings you could split on with a family of four
Neat diner vibe and good service
Th food
Cold and bland like eating paste pancakes we uncooked bacon was raw 
This is a real shame because it's a cool place"}
{"text":"Oh, what a disappointment and change in only 3 weeks. I paid an expectant second visit tonight and feel really let down. This time I tried the new addition to the menu - sirloin and shrimp. The sirloin I requested medium rare, but when it arrived it was well done, dry and comprised a piece of beef the size of the palm of my hand made up of mostly inedible gristle. I wrapped it up and took it home for my dog (who will normally eat anything), but even she turned up her nose at it.
I previously gave the Black Bear a 5 star review for my first visit 3 weeks ago, but I am afraid that this experience barely warrants a level of 2 stars. The bill of around $20 would, I feel, have been better spent at one of the numerous buffets that Las Vegas has to offer."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  Love coming here . The food is great and the staff treats everyone like family.  

Also, they have freshly squeezed orange juice and  a fantastic coffee roast blend.  

Must try the pancakes!!!!!! Yum... Nom nom"}
{"text":"My friends decided to take my on an adventure on St. Patrick's Day after spending the evening down town.  This was thier favorite spot for breakfast.  For 930 am on a Sunday morning there was quite a crowd of people waiting but the place is so big that we were seated within 15 minutes.  
 
As you walk through the door the decor is definitely \"black bear\" themed.  A shelf of stuffed bears circle the restaurant-every stuffed bear you have ever seen is up there.   Probably a little creepy at night.  Just sayin.  So we sit down to order-we are famished!

So in honor of St. Patricks Day I HAD to order the corned beef hash.  The waitress was pretty nice and seemed to know every guest seated around us.  It actually looks like a place where the regulars would go. :)   My friends ordered some kind of nut grain pancakes and biscuits and gravy.  My friends husband had the nut grain pancakes and I thought for a second \"what are you thinkin\" but I let him make the mistake on his own as he is the biggest breakfast guru I know.  He was very sad and disappointed but ate the whole thing even though he didnt like the tast.  The busquits and gravy was just that....a plate full of stick to your ribs gooey biscuits with white gravy.  Looked yummy but I would feel I would need something to go with that...It was huge by the way.  The corned beef hash was incredible with their homemade potatoes.  Toast a little on the dry side but all in all - I ordered the best breakfast out of all of us. ;)

On the way out they have these homemade pies-individual size.  They looked amazing and I was half way temted to grab one to go.  Maybe next time.  I wouldnt mind trying this place out again to try something different.  Its a little out of my way but ya just never do know where you will end up on a Sunday morning on the town. ;)"}
{"text":"What a great place! Only wish they had places in New Jersey where I live. Good, hearty, healthy, quality food at a reasonable price. Love the pecan-crusted trout. Love the sauteed veggies. They did well with all the soups we tried. My wife found the half-sandwich with a bowl of soup just right for her. Love the sauteed veggies. I said that? OK, it bears repeating. (No pun intended.)

Two stories:
I was in Phoenix to visit my son. We looked for a place to eat and he said, \"I've heard good things about Black Bear Diner. I've been meaning to try it. So we did. We wound up eating there three times in our six-day visit.

My wife wanted to go there for soup-and-sandwich, and wondered what the soup was. I called and found out it was chicken noodle. My wife was disappointed, but we thought we'd go anyway. Two minutes later, my phone rings. It's Julia from Black Bear Diner. She double-checked, and it was really split pea with ham -- a favorite of ours. She had checked the caller ID, and called me back to correct the error. Service above and beyond the call."}
{"text":"I've been enjoying breakfast at Black Bear Diner every weekend for several years.  The staff is wonderful and the food is always good."}
{"text":"Went to this location for the 2nd time in a week; experienced breakfast w/a friend and dinner after a show on the Strip w/friends. Both times I ordered the California Omelet and both times was pleased. The others also ordered an egg dish and was pleased. Staff both times was delightful and accommodating! Only items missing from the menu is the offering of GLUTEN FREE BREAD, MUFFINS, DESSERTS. Definitely recommend Black Bear Diner."}
{"text":"We enjoyed great service and meals at this diner. I had a sausage breakfast and without a doubt the best restaurant meal ever. The eggs, hash browns and sausage were cook to perfection. My wife enjoyed a BLT serving with excellent french-fries! Servings were prompt and hot from the kitchen. We will be returning to this diner again - HAT OFF to the manager Lynne Sharp!!"}
{"text":"Great food great service, big servings, one of the best places I have eaten in out in Vegas"}
{"text":"The service I have received at both Black Bear Diners has been wonderful. They event helped me host an event and the staff did an amazing job!
You can't be good customer service with a smile."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere are really awesome. They give you more than you can eat and the staff is friendly.  However I wasn't too happy when half way through our meal I  heard a  server from the kitchen  talking about how her vagina was leaking.... I don't think they are aware that customers can hear them. Maybe adding a door between thr bar and kitchen, or telling them to not talk about their vaginas during a dinner rush?"}
{"text":"I wanted fried chicken and waffles and this place delivered.  The chicken is more like chicken fried steak but it was super moist and crunchy.  The waffle batter super rich and creamy.  It comes with fruit which is great as it is a heavy meal and large portions.  I also tried their orange juice and it is fresh squeezed and delicious.  If you are hungry and looking for just a great diner to go to, I highly recommend this place!  Service was also impeccable."}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner is the epitome of what America is today:  obese, gluttonous and having a deadly fear of anything that even sounds like exercise.  Go in and count the number of men in there with a 36 inch waist or less ... you MIGHT make it to the end of the fingers on your first hand  (and let's not talk about the Wagnerian-built female patrons!  \"Rubenesque\" would be a kind description).

Now, the restaurant itself:  if you can sneak in there without your fitness trainer seeing you do so, Black Bear Diner is THE place to drown in comfort food.  The cooks in Goodyear have recently been replaced, or must have been, because the Reuben, for example, no longer drips in grease on your plate.  The food is almost always good and the women who wait on the customers undertipped, underpaid and underappreciated  (believe me:  they deserve to be tipped well beyond the 15% standard ... especially as meals are pretty cheap here and the bill will be small).  Whether the management knows how to hire or the girls just bust their tails, because they're afraid one of the patrons will roll on top of them if service is too slow, I don't know.  My favorites:  the fried chicken, the aptly named Volcano  (pancakes, sausage, eggs, etc.), which will cause your blood sugar to erupt like one; their Reubens, Club sandwiches ... they're all good:  you can't go wrong.

Beware Sunday mornings, when well-dressed Church goers mob the place as well as Fridays, when they have their all you can eat fish fry.  And just in case you really were able to find pants with elastic waistlines, don't forget the cream pie desserts.  

In summary, while the food is far from gourmet, it's usually quite tasty, comes in large quantities and will leave you full for a long time afterwards.  

I recently returned to Black Bear Diner after a 3 year absence, because I was in the mood for a sinfully caloric breakfast.  The waitresses had no problem recognizing my rotund figure, even though I had lost 40 pounds in my absence replacing Volcanoes and Club Sandwiches with exercise and a moderate diet.  After telling me how wonderful I looked, one of them asked me how I did it.

\"Simple,\" I replied.  \"I stayed away from here.\"

Black Bear Diner - it's what America's all about."}
{"text":"Continuing our tradition of a new breakfast restaurant every Sunday, Easter brought us here and it turned out to be a good choice.  Our late start had me concerned that there would be a long wait.  But I was happily surprised that there was only a brief wait before we got seated.  And even though it was rather busy our waitress arrived promptly, brought our drinks and took our order.  Their Easter breakfast special was an asparagus and ham omelet.  I don't see how that dish fits with Easter, but I ordered it anyway.  Being gluten intolerant I asked if I could substitute fruit for the bread offering and they were happy to oblige.  I was surprised that the fruit had strawberries and seemed to be more of an upgrade than a substitute, which was great.  The omelet was good enough, unique to my taste, but it wasn't well blended so the filling pieces separated when I cut into it. Sadly, that subtracted from the full effect of the taste combination, but that is the only complaint I have.  My wife had pancakes and bacon from the menu which she really enjoyed.  Their bear decor is unique and gives the place a friendly ambiance.  The staff was pleasant, cheerful and helpful even thought they were really hustling on what was a very busy day."}
{"text":"This place has always been amazing.  If you are looking for diner food they sure do deliver.  They have the comfort foods down pat!  I'm sad that they closed the bell and 17 interstate location.  But if you are looking for a diner this is 10xs better than Denny's!!"}
{"text":"This location is older, I think giving it a good deep cleaning would be the right thing to do. Aside from that you can't go wrong at Black Bear! Great staff, great food, you definitely get what you pay for! They also have healthier alternatives if you're not looking to clog your arteries."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe with a woodsy theme. The black bear cafe serves breakfast lunch and dinner. Feels like you are in a log cabin with a jukebox playing oldies in the background. The staff is friendly and very attentive. I love the fact that they have their own ketchup and sauces. For the menu, they give you a cute little newspaper. Food portions are big so come hungry. I ordered The Grizz. If your into breakfast, this is the plate for you. You can choose from a waffle, pancake or French toast. It also comes with bacon, ham and sausage and your choice of hash browns or potatoes . The bacon was delicious! The rest of the food was okay. Definitely add some salt and pepper. Overall good experience here."}
{"text":"Yum! I found Black Bear Diner on Yelp & our group was so glad we went. Sweet cream pancakes, red potatoes, crisp hash browns, and biscuits from heaven! Our server, Cindi, was great. We never ran out of a beverage. The only downside is they won't seat you until all guests have arrived; but, that is understandable. It was busy, but the staff was top notch. This will be a regular stop on my next visit."}
{"text":"Leaving here stuffed, large portions. Food was very tasty. Never been disappointed at a Black Bear Diner."}
{"text":"We've been going there for three years and really liked it.  Then, last year they discontinued my favorite pork cutlets with apples, but we kept going.  Last night, I stopped by to have my other favorite, Pecan Crusted Trout.  They had substituted an Herb/tomato crust.  Not  interested in it, I had the Breaded Fried Shrimp.  The Panko breading was so rough, it hurt my palate. I think they've lost a couple of customers unless they quit messing with our old favorites."}
{"text":"Have been going here for about 7 years, not so much in the past 3 years because I have tried all their menu items for breakfast. I do have a tradition of going here on my birthday because that was the first time I came here 7 years ago. The last year, I went to the one in Chandler because it was close to me, and I had my favorite meal, biscuit and gravy. Their biscuits were(that being the operative word) one of the best I have ever had, but it was completely dried and the gravy was so salty. I chalked it up to this location so I recently went back to the Gilbert location and ordered the same thing and it is also completely dried where it used to be so flaky and fluffy.  Their other items are so so, nothing to really go out of your way for so I guess this is likely the last time I follow this tradition of going here for my birthday."}
{"text":"Nice clean place. Food was excellent- they even have some healthier options. Service was excellent as well! Coffee was legit!"}
{"text":"Condescending and rude host. 25 minute wait turned into 45 minutes with 10 people on the list yet so really more than an hour. If it's going to be an hour say it's going to be an hour. Not that great a breakfast to wait an hour. At Biscuits enjoying my food now. Never going back again."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN! DISGUSTED! When we arrived the hostess proceeded to take the tip money off our table from the previous diner. She then touched the silverware for my daughter with her dirty hands. Mind you, she did not touch the handle, but the part you put in you mouth. We asked for new silverware which our server provided. The children's menu was disgusting, it had old butter on the menu and a clear orange juice stain from a previous diner. The adult menus looked old, stained and worn out. My first glass of diet coke had lipstick on it, so I requested a new glass from another server. The other server brought me a new drink, which had some food crud stuck to the top of the glass. We then asked our server to cancel our order and left. This was the worst dining experience. If the staff doesn't know how to properly touch silverware, the silverware is dirty, the menus are disgusting, and the glassware isn't being cleaned properly I don't want to have any part of eating here. It's unsanitary and disgusting. We couldn't chance what would happen next so we left disgusted."}
{"text":"I prefer this breakfast place over Village Inn,  Denny's,  or JBs.  Because  I like fresh fruit and whipped cream with my pancakes and waffles. The others defrost frozen fruit.  I like crisp fruit instead of soggy oozey fruit. 
I also do not like overstuffed adult sized meals.
But the last server refused to allow me to order a big kid meal.  It's \"policy\".
Big kids are even larger than myself.  And it was never an issue before.
It's a real turn off to force customers into buying excessive quantities of food.  So that policy knocks a star off."}
{"text":"Food portion was big and it was quality food... Had the chicken fried steak and yummy ... Gf had the waffle and I'm not a big waffle fan but tried some and wow it was good .. Definitely coming back on next Vegas trip"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast joint.  Went with the Grizz- 3 eggs two bacon two sausage and 2 pancakes..lot of food.  Nice place.  Want to try for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Best place to have breakfast and not too high in price. My fiancé and I were there this weekend and our bill was like $27. Ask to sit with Summer she is very nice and fun."}
{"text":"I'm the sort of person who has invested hundreds of hours pursuing the perfect burger. In short, the BIG burgers at Black Bear Diner are above average.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. The pancakes are to die for! Awesome service. Beautiful deserts! Everything is delicious and perfectly made. Yum yum ooooooh yum!!"}
{"text":"Bacon cakes were ok, but maybe I just didn't know what to order.  I usually like my bacon crispy.  My girlfriend did the French toast and were also ok, not really thick bread, as said. Would still go back and order something different for a second chance."}
{"text":"I always have good service when I come to eat here and was really excited to see that they have a few vegetarian options. Everything is made to order and fresh.  Marlene was my server today and she was great!"}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner has a very homey feel to it. The huevos rancheros was really good and the serving size was pretty big. The only thing that could of been better was the service. It was not busy when I was eating there, but took a while to get our food. Im not sure if It was understaffed, but seeing the servers a little more often would of been nice. All in all I would still recommend the restaurant to anybody!"}
{"text":"After having been here three times I figured it was time for a review. This place is alright and the service is lack luster. We sat at the bar once (right near the kitchen) on a very slow evening and got our food after twenty or so minutes. 

The pancakes are wonderful, more like dessert for breakfast but hey, thats what you want from a home-town diner. 

I have had the chicken strips which were salty but good and a large portion. I am sure that we will be back and I will continue to try dishes until I find the perfect dish that brings this rating from a three to a five."}
{"text":"I have been to several Black Bear Diner locations in the past. The decor and the food is all about the same. However, this location is not up to par with the others. 

The place is grimy and disorganized, plus the staff seems like they are overwhelmed with simple orders. 

The last time I went, the time that made me swear that I will never go back, I ordered Chicken Caesar salad. I received a chefs salad. I sent it back. After quite a while, the server delivered a Chinese chicken salad. 

I explained that the salad was not a Caesar. She argued with me that it was and I didn't know what a Caesar was. I didn't eat it and she refused to take it off the bill. 

I never went back. I live two blocks away and drive right past them when I eat out, which is several times a week. They lost all that revenue over one server  having a bad customer service attitude."}
{"text":"The food not good at all !!! Coffee was good .., waste of time and money never coming back"}
{"text":"The two of us went to the Black Bear just before noon on Sunday, and were surprised that there was a long line of people waiting to be seated.  So we figured the locals must like the place.  They have lots of cute bear photos and statues, so the decor is rustic and pleasant.

After about 20 minutes we were seated and they took our beverage order.  Our beverages came quickly and we placed our order.  My wife ordered the turkey breast dinner and I ordered the wild salmon dinner with veggie soup.

It took quite a while for our food to come, which wasn't a surprise given the crowd.  First they ran out of veggie soup, so I got tomato, which was OK.  My salmon was pretty strange; it was brown,  overcooked, and dry.  The mashed potatoes and broccoli were fine (although I had ordered green beans).  My wife's turkey was some of that reconstituted turkey roll substance and also pretty dry.  Her green beans were saturated with butter, not good, since dairy causes her to have joint pains and she hates the taste of butter.  So I ate her beans and she ate my broccoli.  At least she could eat the mashed potatoes and said they were pretty good.  Her iced tea was also good and refilled promptly.

So $35 (plus tip) later, it was probably the poorest meal we've had in the Las Vegas area.  At least our dog got some simulated turkey, which she ate with gusto!

All the other customers seemed to be eating giant pancakes and monster hamburgers, which are probably better choices if you want to try the Black Bear.

Note that you have to pay at the cashier up front, which was also busy, so you have to stand in yet another line to settle your bill."}
{"text":"hands down the best breakfast place in the weat calley!!!!
great service and amazing food no matter what i order."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Server Jonathan was great. Very attentive. Our first visit, but he paid as much attention us S his regulars. Friendly and professional."}
{"text":"The sweet cream pancakes are easily some of the best in the valley. Also don't pass up the sausage patties, made in-house. Tends to be a little busy first thing in the morning, but luckily Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner are served all day. A must try."}
{"text":"Large portions, good food, good service. They got our order wrong but offered extra helpings of the correct order, we declined because the portions are HUGE!"}
{"text":"Always a good place to come in and just get a lot of hearty food. Normally stick to breakfast items here, as I have been let down by some of the other entrees. Today had Meat Lovers Omelette, which was fantastic. Any meal you can get that comes with their large biscuits also is a plus. The family is always happy when we decide to eat here."}
{"text":"Really really good food and usually always good, fast service. My only complaint is not enough parking for the amount of customers they have, as well as not enough spots to sit and wait. I am pregnant and have ended up standing for long periods of time while waiting to be seated... Not cool!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the service was great. So was the manager Don. Or so I thought until I was alone and he tried hitting on me. I am only 18 years of age and once I was alone he came up to me handing me a card with his phone number telling me to text him. He proceeded in making me uncomfortable by winking at me making me \"promise\" that I'll text him, or otherwise he'd be very sad. When I left he rubbed my shoulder and said he'd be waiting for a text from me. Made me feel extremely uncomfortable and harassed. Besides this everyone else was great and the food was delicious. This manager Don needs to recognize his boundaries and do his flirting elsewhere. Not where he runs a business especially with someone noticeably younger than him."}
{"text":"It's good stuff and reminds you of the quintessential diner experience. With lots of stuffed bears. Having said that, I tasted the chicken fried steak and it was good but not remarkable. I feel like nothing was really fresh. Basically, it's a diner."}
{"text":"We often eat here because it is so close to our home. 90% of the time the food is decent but we have definitely had some misses. We stick to what we know is good like the big bear burger, onion rings and chicken club sandwich. The biggest issue is the wait staff. The best server we have dealt with is shanna. she ways is smiling and very sweet. However, every time we have been in there we have experienced extremely unprofessional servers who talk down to each other, complain about each other and down right argue loudly right in the dining room. Often we only eat there out of convenience. We both have been in the service industry and find the attitude and actions of the servers to be completely unprofessional and downright appalling. However, Shanna is amazing. So sweet and always attentive and smiling. From now on we will always request her section. We have eaten there many many times and EVERY time experience this problem with the staff. Management needs to really get that issue under control. I am giving 3 stars for decent food and personal convenience of location. I will say that this is regarding the night staff. We have not been there for breakfast."}
{"text":"Had a yummy breakfast here this morning. Shasta scramble, avocados spinach bell peppers onion tomatoes and swiss cheese. Was delicious. Service was friendly and quick. The coffee was hot and fresh and in a giant mug. Waitress checked back frequently.  Nice rustic atmosphere."}
{"text":"Since the staff at the original Las Vegas Black Bear (Tropicana at Jones) informed us that they will be closing for renovation/remodel in the near future, the darling Orchid and I decided to check out the newest restaurant on West Sahara at Durango.

Orchid says it looks like it used to be a Marie Callendar's by the front-door layout (and I have to agree with her).  There is counter seating (unlike Tropicana/Jones).

We were greeted promptly, acknowledged cheerfully, and seated quickly.  Orchid's concerns about her walker and personal mobility were addressed graciously.  The server, a young gent named Bernard, was personable and generally a nice guy.  He accommodated our special requests (\"please leave this off of this menu item\" ... \"please substittute this for that on this menu item\" ... even \"please make the ice cream sundae in a tall tulip glass instead of the normal bowl\"); service we have come to expect from the Black Bear, but it's not always provided with a gracious smile and a \"no problem, folks.\"

The food was standard good \"bear food;\"  since it was Friday, Orchid had the all-you-can-eat fish and chips (and didn't eat that much), and I had the parmesan sourdough cheeseburger and the bacon cheeseburger salad (and took some home).  The salad - which is pretty much chef-salad full-entree sized, seemed to be a little smaller than I am used to, but that could be a personal perception thing.  Otherwise, the same good, predictable food ... and isn't that what you want when you go someplace you've been pleased with in the past?

I doubt we'll have any problems with this location while our \"original\" place gets a remodel, but I will (of course) miss our regular complement of first-name-basis staff at Tropicana/Jones.

On the Nighthawk 100-point scale:  a solid 90."}
{"text":"Okay.  The Orchid and I have eaten here for several years, and my thoughts and reviews of ths place are well documented,  But, this is on a different subject, and I have to take my hat off to them,

The long-awaited remodel begins on 15 February.  It seems that, due to some details in the building code, their large collection of stuffed bears will not be permitted to stay in residence after the remodel.  (Dejected sigh.)  They have placed signs on property stating that, if you are the original donor of one of the bears, you have the option of taking it back.  But, the basis for this review has to do with what they plan to do with the bears that remain.

Law-enforcement officers are frequently called to \"referee,\" for lack of a more polite term. domestic assault and domestic violence cases.  These calls frequently involve children, if only (only!) as bystanders.  Police also respond to auto accidents involving shook-up little ones.  Almost every police car has a stuffed animal or two in the trunk to attempt to calm the little ones down.  Black Bear Diner is donating their entire collection to the Las Vegas Metropolirtan Police Department to be used in this capacity.

Well played, folks."}
{"text":"We stopped at the Black Bear tonight.  The service was deplorable.  The server, Seth? ignored our table quite effectively even though he walked right past the table on the way to his other tables.  I sat with an empty glass for at least 20 minutes while he was walking past.  When he finally deigned to recognize the table to refill one of the beverages he walked back with the iced tea with a smug grin on his face.

Plus everything we tried to order was \"out.\"

We will NEVER be back and recommend that everyone else join us in boycotting this mediocre establishment."}
{"text":"One of the weirdest places to find in Vegas... it's like stepping into an alternate universe for a little while - a universe that eats well.

The place is decked out in northwest decor with bears and logs and furs everywhere, and the food matches the theme - basic, hearty, good eatins. I don't care for their \"dinners\" much, but you really can't go wrong with a sandwich/burger or their great breakfasts."}
{"text":"Comfortable, delicious, friendly, fast but relax. Great restaurant for any ocassion. Trust me, your guests will remember eating here. Awsome they opened another Black Diner in Henderson,NV and if you go to California there are many of them. 
Las Vegas is not only buffets, come to Black Diner is aprox 5miles from the Strip. Worth it!!"}
{"text":"we were tired of eating on the strip, and decided to change up our eating routine while in Vegas. I am so glad we did. We were greeted by a very friendly man, who showed us to our seats. There we were greeted by another friendly waitress. I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and eggs, and the better half ordered a Pancake breakfast. My meal also came with a biscuit and hashbrowns. The Biscuit was light as air, and I ordered it covered in gravy (my heart will thank me later). I normally skip the hashbrowns, as most are just cooked enough to pass as edible, this order however was fantastic, most of the hashbrowns were actually brown, and crispy just the way I love them. the Chicken fried steak was so tender that I could cut it with my fork, and the eggs were cooked perfectly. I tried the better half's pancakes, and bacon both were fantastic. overall I was ecstatic on our choice to venture out off the strip, and I look forward to my next visit"}
{"text":"This is a pretty standard diner type of restaurant, one of our favorite kinds. We've been to several Black Bears in our travels and have always found the food to be good and well cooked. The servings are extra large and we usually share one. We've had good customer service every time we've gone."}
{"text":"So....we were regulars at the Tropicana location until they got rid of Teddy Tuesdays  (kids eat free night). We had some gift certificates to use so we decided to check out this new location because it's very close to home. Needless to say, it's essentially the same bear motif, deep woods cabin decor as the Tropicana location but the carpet isn't worn and stained and the walls aren't lined with dusty stuffed bears.

Staff is attentive, and the food and menu seem identical.  Typical diner food, but most of the time we get breakfast. Servings are large, and the kids' menu has a variety. It's not terribly different from the standard breakfast establishments around time. In fact, I wonder how this place will share customers with Biscuits Cafe just next door, although I think Black Bear has better pancakes.

Black Bear is a reliable diner. Nothing more; nothing less."}
{"text":"Very nice the decor reminds me of a vacation mountain resort! Good food, good atmosphere! 

I had three eggs, ham, bacon, and link sausage no potatoes and 2 pancakes!  Yes impart of it was planned as a take home meal! 
Very good! 

My wife had eggs Benedict and she loved it!  They seem to be a West coast group!  

Loved the experience!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was so so. One thing I noticed was while there for over 2 1/2 hours (catching up on old times while with family) was that the men's room needed some attention. Trash cans were overfilled with paper towels on the floor. The staff was ok."}
{"text":"Quintessential diner experience.  I have had several breakfasts there, and I really like the oatmeal!  Comes with brown sugar, milk, and little individual packets of a dried fruit blend (nice touch) and also nuts (not my style).  Big portions on all platter/skillet type meals."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Foods great! Thank you staff for treating us like a guest in your home!
Donna's smile and fast service makes the cherry on top."}
{"text":"Just stopped at Black Bear for breakfast. Normally I love this place but had to leave because the hostess was not accommodating. My dad cannot sit in a booth and can only use chairs due to his medical condition and advanced age. She told us all she had was a small booth because she had two large parties (one of 6 and one of 7) . Instead of opening up another area for the large parties, she just told us \"that's all [they] had and they won't have anything any time soon.\" There's room for seating in the unopened section for 30-40 more patrons and she couldn't accommodate two (one with ADA needs-he's a disabled veteran).

We could have waited, but she didn't even offer that as an option. She was callous and rude. I've been going to Black Bear for many years and have had fabulous service and great food. To be turned away without given any reasonable options is one thing... But to be dismissed rudely really made my day. If she can't handle the stress (and the place wasn't even full) she needs to find another vocation."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come to the new location.  I had just moved & I always went to the Tropicana location by my old house. I was happy to see a new one by my new house. I was seated quickly when I was told a 20 min wait. We sat down and got drinks. Ordering food was next the wait was endless. I waited about 35 mins for my food and for hash browns that were way over cooked. Then I asked for ranch which is bacon ranch but I have a lot of onion in it. Yuck ! I got my food and not even a min later the waiter asks if we need anything else and hands me the CHECK. dude really ??? I didn't even take my first bite and you're rushing me out. I told the manager as I paid she took 50% off. Which was nice. But I really don't know if I will dine here again."}
{"text":"Breakfast time is always busy but worth the wait! Awesome food and crazy big deserts"}
{"text":"Food was ok but service was off. We came in during a slow time and the person who came up after a few minutes to seat us appeared visibly frazzled. No biggie. As we walked to our table the aisle was visibly dirty with food on the ground. We sat for a little longer than average before anyone came to take our drink orders. The service was pretty slow overall. I had to get up twice to ask for refills because A) The cups are TINY! B) I'm a drink guzzler. C) Waitress didn't seem too attentive with refills.
Overall I would say a few kinks probably need to be worked out service-wise. The food wasn't bad, it also wasn't anything above average. If they don't plan on upgrading the beverage cup sizes, they should emphasize attentiveness on refills."}
{"text":"Family friendly service... Smiles all around... Great culture...yummy food too.. Had the California Bacon benedict... Will certainly back. Denise our server is so sweet."}
{"text":"The absolute BEST breakfast I've had in Phoenix! The eggs are always cooked just the way you order them; never over or under cooked. There was no problem when I asked for Eggs Benedict (which is excellent, BTW!) with eggs over easy instead of poached. Food arrives promptly and hot, no matter how busy they are. The only thing they could improve upon is the toast. It's barely buttered and not always warm. A must-try is their link sausage. It's made fresh in house and is incredible!  Get there early because they fill up fast, and bring your appetite! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good menu and food, but slow service.  Yesterday we waited 30 min for 2 sandwiches, and although there were 6 waiters milling about, no one bothered to refill water, etc."}
{"text":"I am writing this review based on their Rib Eye Steak Dinner for $14.99.

Food:

I am not sure why I thought that they would have a good steak, since most diners are known for their breakfast, sandwiches and shakes (should have just went for a shake....), but I still ordered the steak anyway.

Their steak was absolutely disgusting! The worst steak I have ever had in my life (even worse than the overcooked, slightly burnt ones from my ex boyfriend). It was extremely hard to cut through, especially since it was so thin. It was mainly gristle, and no meat. It had so much fat, very bland, and dry. 

It came with an assortment of mixed vegetables (broccoli, squash, zucchini, and onions) which were the best thing on the plate!

Their salad plate was warm, and the salad was literally lettuce, two dime size onions, two warm tomatoes, two cucumbers, and some carrots. There were no croutons, cheese, and their was barely any onions. They were also out of their gluten-free Honey Dijon dressing (which was aggravating).

I really wanted this Diner to work out, but it didn't. 

First Impression:

The outside makes it look somewhat like a lodge. The inside is just a ridiculous, tacky assortment of fake stuffed teddy bears ( in all different sizes!).

I don't know what type of look they were going for... but when I think of a lodge, I think of walls covered with dead animals, and huge stuffed bears with big teeth (not a little beanie baby....??)

Service:

The server was nice, and we tipped her 20% on our bill for $35.00. Food was delivered fast, since we were basically the only ones in there.

{"text":"Not quite a 'corporate chain' but getting close. Food was bland with no flavor and unimaginative. There are a plethora of good places to eat in the vicinity so I'm confused as why there was a wait for a table. The whole front lobby is a mess when there's a wait, people checking in, people cashing out and servers trying to get beer. The staff dressed however they wanted and looked rather sloppy."}
{"text":"One of our faves.   Great breakfast portions.  Amazing pancakes.  Always a wait but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and always packed (not too long of a wait normally). I've been here about 5 or 6 times and I have to say that the food is just average.. biscuits are the best things I've had there and the chicken and waffles is the worst I've had. Bacon is nice and thick"}
{"text":"The portions are huge and the price is right, something lacking in a lot of homestyle restaurants these days. We havent returned to any of our old breakfast haunts since finding this place 6 years ago and ill never go back. The staff has always been nice as well."}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner has great food,huuuge portions, and good customer service. Weve been to black bear 5 times now, but only for breakfast and everytime we go they are consistent. The times we've gone has had a 30 min wait, but it honestly doesn't bother me, it gives me a chance to browse the menu. See what we do while waiting is asked for menus,so as soon as we get seated we let our server know what we want. 

I always get the Eggs Benedict. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the hollandaise sauce was creamy and my gosh they give you so much, my meal came with a bowl of fruit,  potatoes and they are good! Hubby got some kind of meat plate with eggs and that was huge oh and the sausages were meaty which i liked. The little bro had pancakes, i had a bite and it was delicious. 

Our servers dont bother us. They come when your drink needs filled and comes and asked if we need anything here and there, other than that they leave you alone and let you enjoy your meal. At some resto, I hate it when the food barely gets to your table and you havent even gotten a chance to sink your teeth in then they asked you ''hows everything tasting?'' one of these day I will respond with ''well i dont know, can you let me eat first then ill tell you\"  oh and I hate a chatty server. Im here to eat not talk haha! But seriously you have to try this place and hopefully youll enjoy dining here as much as we do."}
{"text":"Made my first breakfast visit this morning. Two prior lunch visits were better by far. Service was fine, food so-so. Ordered corned beef hash. What I got was more a pile of pulled corned beef. Hash browns were oddly ribbon cut too thick to get golden brown and crispy. Flabby, boiled kind of consistency made them almost pasta-like, and noodles with pulled corned beef wasn't really the breakfast combo classic that I'd hoped to enjoy here. Add to that the fact that two breakfast plates, a short stack of pancakes and a single orange juice set me back $40 (with tip), and a three-demerit review is my takeaway this time, Black Bear, sorry."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first because i did not see any people of color when i first walked in and felt a little out of place. I am from San Francisco and it is always diversity.  But that was just me feeling unbalanced after walking 7 miles in the CES conference...lol... I had a great experience here, the waiter was very friendly and the place was neat. I did not have to go to the restroom so I cannot judge the cleanliness there. 
The place was also clean at the table and plates / look. I tried to order the  smalls portion on the menu and it was still large. At this place you get more bang for your buck. I would recommend this place... My hubby said the homemade biscuits were sooooooo good and huge. I would definitely come here again when I visit Vegas. My taste buds was off on the steak I ordered, don't get fried steak unless you want fried foods. I had a taste for the sauteed steak. But overall it was so cool. The waiter noticed my feelings towards my meal and acknowledge them.  But I felt like Inside this place it felt like a you were not even in Vegas but in a very homely secure place."}
{"text":"The service was great! The waitress was awesome! However, I ordered the Hot Turkey Sandwich. But gravy tasted sour. I had to order something different, which was the steak meal, steak had no flavor. Had to add salt and pepper but still no flavor. I couldn't get the sour taste out of my mouth."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I used to love coming here literally every other weekend. The food was delicious and the price was good for the serving size. There have been several times that the servers were rude and have also charged my bill twice for drink items resulting in an addition $10 added to my bill. (this is a sly way to get a bigger tip)! I have overlooked this because at the end of the day I have enjoyed the food. Yesterday however was the last time I will ever come in. I got another really rude server that completely ruined my experience and the food quality went down drastically! 
My husband ordered an omelet that was so tiny! You can get an omelet from ihop that is 3 times the size! The omlet had some meat on top and in the middle with no cheese, no flavor and dry. The entire plate was basically potatoes with no seasoning or flavor like they used to have and toast with no butter. It was really bad tasting and he did't eat any of it.
I ordered scrambled eggs, hash browns and a waffle. My eggs were flat and tough (not scrambled). it looks like they poured the eggs and let them sit till over done. I love fluffy scrambled eggs so it was a huge let down. I ordered american cheese on my hashbrowns and they literally put 2 sliced on top and served me. The cheese was cold and I picked it up off the hash browns. Yuck! The waffle was made with their pancake batter and it was cold and rubbery. 
To top this entire experience off when I went to check out I knew that I had $10 off from previous dining. I had not been in for a while due to surgery and couldn't wait to come in and eat. Apparently they stopped doing their promotion during this time and I had to speak with a manager for my discount. The manager lectured me about how they stopped doing the promotion and had given notice and even went out another 2 weeks from the end date. He said that I should have been informed of this and he didn't understand how I missed the notice that went out (I'm wondering how I would have gotten notice)?
After my lecture he did give me the $10 off but honestly I should have been treated better than this. I'm always polite through situations like this so for me to experience rude service and management is unacceptable. 
For all of this I will not return"}
{"text":"This was our first time to Black bear diner a friend told me it was a good place to eat so we tried it. Two couples one from Indiana and one from California and we both had a magnificent breakfast very large portions and tasted very good.my friend got the cinnamon roll french toast, she said it was the best ever! Bear claw was huge qnd tasty too!"}
{"text":"The food here is great! Wonderfully sized portions. Most plates can be shared. Breakfast served all day. Real home cooked taste to almost every dish. Service is ALWAYS superb! Deanna at the Tempe location is really sweet. Would have given 5 stars except the music is horrific and plays too loud over the speakers. They have a jukebox but the selections are minimal. It puts a damper on enjoying a nice meal. Would make me hesitate to dine here. Otherwise love the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food. Outstanding service! I stopped in here around 7am during the week expecting it to be somewhat busy, but we were seated instantly. I started off with some orange juice, which I must say was a little pricey for one glass, but it was one damn good glass of orange juice... the food was amazing. Went with the chicken fried steak and some hash browns and eggs and was not disappointed. Their toast is also amazing! This is my go to favorite diner! And it's in a great location, right off the I-10! Keep it up black bear"}
{"text":"I've passed by this place many times but was never interested in trying it. It just seemed like a Denny's, Marie Callender's type of restaurant, but my friend wanted to try it out. The waitress was trying hard to be overly bubbly that she wasn't listening. She brought the wrong vegetables & drink. Also I asked for a medium steak & it was medium well. It tasted just Ok. The cornbread they offered were very dry. In the end, I guess she got annoyed that we didn't order our dessert right away & she took our menu away without asking us anything. I'm not impressed & won't be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my mom the day after Christmas since we were feeling too lazy to really make breakfast. It was past 10:30AM and we were a bit concerned about there being a long wait. Apparently not! We were standing for about five minutes and then seated. 

While looking over the menu, I had a good look around the restaurant. I love the ambiance and all the bears everywhere. It's got a much warmer, cozier vibe than most of the breakfast places in town despite being a fairly large chain. It has the look of a locally owned restaurant and I like that.

My mom had the corned beef hash and I had the steak and eggs. My mom really enjoyed her breakfast. I got the wrong type of potato in my order and my steak was a bit overcooked; however, everything tasted really great so I was okay with it. The portions were really big and the biscuits I got with my order were still attached and looked like the size of a newborn puppy (best description I could think of). Service was friendly and as quick as it could be considering it was pretty busy. Great breakfast!"}
{"text":"First time coming to Black Bear Diner. Great place! The atmosphere was friendly and comfortable. I had the California Omelette and my husband had French toast meal. The food was delicious. Highly recommend this Diner! Our waitress Cindie was a delight, very friendly and upbeat. Service was great. Very happy I stumbled upon this diner! By the way the portion sizes were very big! Could not finish all my breakfast."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to check out Black Bear because it had 4 stars. Big mistake. Honestly, this place isn't as good as a IHOP or a Denny's. The quality and taste are about the same. Nothing special. 

The omelet was THE WORST omelet ever made. They basically took the eggs, scrambled them, then just folded them over WITH NO CHEESE. WTF. When we asked the waitress she gave an attitude and said she can just bring out the cheese. We asked to bring it back. All they did was take cold cheese and put it in the eggs. Terrible. The manager never apologized or came to check on us. 

The chicken fried steak was standard which is weird since it's supposed to be \"the number one best seller\". Certainly didn't taste like it. Gravy was tasteless as well. I tried to compensate with tons of pepper and a good amount of salt. 

You want to know the real big F up? HOW DO YOU MAKE A TASTELESS FRENCH TOAST EVEN WITH SYRUP? well go here to find out. No powdered sugar. Weird that the syrup had no taste and couldn't even save a flavorless french toast. 

Service was rude and one of the girls just had this \"going through the motions don't care at all about the customers\" attitude. 

The Waitress also spilled the ENTIRE syrup on her hand and pancake then had the nerve to ask \"do you still want it?\" How bout using common sense and bring it back to make new ones. 

Overall I just wouldn't waste my time or money on this place again. Honestly the faster you get this S%^& out of your stomach the better."}
{"text":"I love the Blackbear it's such a homey little restaurant. My personal fav. Is the B-l-a-s-t! Bacon, Lettuce, Avocado, & Tomato!"}
{"text":"If Great food, an exceptional atmosphere, and having fun dining are your goals - this would be a good choice for a next meal - breakfast, lunch, or dinner."}
{"text":"Can't beat this place for the price. Our bill was around $20 for two people and our meals were huge. I had eggs Benedict and it was amazing! Everything is made from scratch and the servers are super friendly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I loved the sausage. The Cubs meals were  big but it was qood.great service.there were lots of people. I suggest bigger bathrooms."}
{"text":"Today I'm having peach cobbler and bacon and eggs and the wife is also having bacon and eggs good stuff. And like always great service"}
{"text":"Perfect place to soak up all the tequila from the night before that I shouldn't have had.  Omelette was delish, biscuits were redonk.  Minus one star for slow (though good) service.  Asked multiple times for water refills (essential!) but didn't get it.  No worries though, I'll be back my next trip to Vegas!!"}
{"text":"In all honesty, compared to ihop, village inn, Denny's, Mimi's Cafe i hands down prefer BLACK BEAR ALL THE WAY!!! Last Sunday was my first time there and it's now my favorite place. The pancakes are so delicious, and a must try! Love the atmosphere & over all great first time experience!"}
{"text":"Will NEVER go back! Hair in my son's pancakes! I showed our waitress and she commented \"thankfully it was the last bite\" I took as insinuating we did it purposely! It was not even his last bite. Been here once before and it was great, I am a very good tipper and tipped the waitress 50%. This time around was horrible. Yes they agreed to comp that plate (which was only a child's plate) I was not interested in getting it comp'd, I wish I had better service on the issue from the place! But you will not get that here especially from waitress Cathy??? I think... older lady with dirty blonde hair. Still left her a good tip as to show her it wasn't about the money! She probably was surprised! Too bad because I take my son to a trampoline place very close to this and he loved going to eat before! Well I will have to find another restaurant to spend my money!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast and lunch spots in Vegas.  

I love the food, and the service is fantastic! 

I've never had a dish here I didn't like. 

Oh yeah, and you get Southwest Dining For Miles points too... bonus!"}
{"text":"We've visited quite a few Black Bear Diner's and this was our least favorite. It wasn't because of the food, it was because of the service and errors by the cooks. The food was very good with huge servings, but.... Cindy, our server, began cheery and friendly but ended up not meeting our needs. We look over their super, cute newspaper menu and decide what each of us want to order, she takes our orders, but before she leaves to put the order in, she all of the sudden remembers that the biscuits won't be ready for 20 minutes! :( WHAT?! A few of us had ordered the biscuits and gravy, now we have to re-order! :( So, she brings out the order, well.... \"most\" of the food...a few of us had to wait an additional 5 minutes for our food (didn't order anything special). Something was cooked incorrectly (cooks fault) so now that person has to wait another TEN minutes for their food. It was ridiculous!        NOTE: There were 7 adults, no kids, no unreasonable demands on food preparation....it just wasn't an good experience for us at this location; however, we would still HIGHLY recommend visiting a (different location) Black Bear Diner!

Visited October 2016"}
{"text":"Ever time we've eaten there they never have have enough staff. 
When it first opened they had plenty of staff but it looks like the honeymoon is over.
The waiting issue got worse and worse with each visit.
Even when it's not busy, you have to wait for someone to come to the front to seat you.  Then they don't have enough servers....more waiting!  
When we went yesterday, there was only ONE cook.  We placed our order and waited ONE HOUR and still no food!!  The diner wasn't that busy, either.
The poor young lady who set up our table apologized.
Never heard from a manger....
We had to leave because we had children and they were \"starving\" and restless.
Never returning to this place again."}
{"text":"A great, low-brow breakfast diner, this is my Mom's favorite spot. She loves the biscuits and gravy, while I usually opt for pancakes and eggs.

The portions are huge, so bring your appetite! I've never really eaten anything but breakfast food here... Seems like more of that kind of place. Even in the afternoon.

Not fancy at all... Just a home-spun kind of country diner, decorated with natural wood and hundreds of teddy bears. They have lots of desserts in their display case, too."}
{"text":"part of my power walk routine ....although this last week it was jog - power walk ...at times i'll stop at fresh and easy, other times, albertson's and if it's one of those days i didn't wake up until 10 or so ( sorry boodah for late breakfast ! )  then i might end the exercise at the doorsteps of black bear diner ....it's all about the breakfast ( they are open for lunch and heck...maybe dinner...not even sure ! ) my sis loves their country fried steak ...just give me the ham steak, eggs and those biscuits and i'm a happy camper !!!  i'm not sure...but the place might actually be a chain....it doesn't feel that way ..it feels like a local hangout....if you need a good hearty breakfast and your on the westside - black bear diner is worth a looksy"}
{"text":"Great food, favorite pancakes on the world. Service is lacking, kitchen is slow and it isn't busy.  Pancakes shouldn't take 30 minutes."}
{"text":"YUM. 

Venture off the Strip and the tourists to eat where the locals eat. The Portuguese sausage and eggs were incredible, especially with a big, so-fluffy-it's-hard-to-eat biscuit on the side. 

The only reason this is four stars instead of five is the so-so coffee. But huge portions, and great food make it a perfect place to fuel up before a day of Vegas sightseeing."}
{"text":"Not great. Music was WAY too loud for breakfast time. Wow. I just couldn't get away from it. I'm ok with country music, but it was really distracting. Food was mediocre at best, service was good."}
{"text":"Good food and coffee at average prices. Large portions. Wife and I split a tri-tip (seasoned beef) hoagie type sandwich with a salad that was on special for $9. Good coffee was $2.50. Breakfast offerings looked good but we didn't try this time."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast yesterday, our second time at this location. Took a friend visiting from out of town.   There was a small wait when we arrived, no big deal. Once we were sat at our table - it took over 20 minutes for a server to even acknowledge us! It was like they were avoiding us - unreal! They visited the surrounding tables multiple times. People sat after us were getting their food before we even had our drink order taken. We were about to get up and walk out when finally a waiter asked if we'd been helped- he told us multiple times we weren't his table but he'd still help us. Well, gee, thanks...
It took another 20+ minutes for our food to arrive and when it did it was just ok- not great.  
They do give large portions and the only reason I'm giving them 2 starts is our first experience was decent."}
{"text":"Currently having breakfast here. The eggs were terrible and I could not eat them (ordered sunny side up but got scrambled which they did correct). Sunnyside eggs were cooked in so much oil it tasted like plastic.  Ham was ok at best. Toast was nearly burnt. Overall, this was one of the worst breakfast experiences I've had in some time."}
{"text":"When I met some friends for dinner at this restaurant at the end of October, I liked it so much that I made a mental note to write something later.   I've just signed onto Yelp, and this is my first review.

Our group of friends hadn't seen each other for a while.   Busy catching up, we didn't open our menus for quite a while.  I was impressed that our waitress (her name might be Mel) kept coming back in the nicest way to check on us, but didn't interrupt our conversation.   She kept letting us know that she was ready when we were.  

When we were finally ready to order, she asked:  \"Separate checks?\"   Terrific.  That was exactly what we needed.

I hadn't expected to like the food, because I had heard and read that it was all the  high-calorie \"comfort\" variety.   It was a nice surprise that I was able to get low-calorie substitutions for the sides that went with my entree.

Overall, it was a very nice experience."}
{"text":"Took my son and sister here for the first time over the weekend, and the opinion between us is that we don't understand how this place got bad reviews. 

We were seated within 5 minutes upon arriving, even though the place was in the brunch hour (11 AM on a Saturday) and fairly busy. The waitress took our drink orders immediately and gave us time to look over the menus. I ordered the NY Strip breakfast, my sister got The Grizz and for my son we got the Mini Volcano off the child's menu. Expecting that the size of the servings here would be about the average of everywhere else, we weren't intimidated by ordering off the Hungry Bear's breakfast. We were quite wrong. We were both shocked and pleased with the very ample serving sizes of everything presented, and the home made quality of all of it. We were certainly left with enough to eat later on in the day!

The hotcakes (pancakes) were amazing, not the microwave reheated mess you typically get at some places. Home made sausages were also tasty. My son actually ate everything without complaint. The steak was cooked exactly as I ordered, and was tender enough to be pulled apart just by putting pressure on the steak with the knife and using the fork to pull the meat. Eggs done perfectly, biscuits were ginormous. My sister held no complaints for her meal, either. She got the 7 grain hotcakes with her meal, and they were actually very tasty and had a pleasant texture.

Our experience was great, service was prompt and friendly.
We will be returning, and bringing more people with us.

HIGHLY Recommended. 
Enormous portions at amazing prices."}
{"text":"THE BEST BREAKFAST PLACE FOR THE MONEY HANDS DOWN!

I'm a HUGE fan of breakfast which in turn makes me a huge fan of diners. I'm also a fan of good diners that server good food at great prices. Norms, Pann's and possibly Mel's would be one of these so called places. Denny's... hell no.

This place easily overshadows Norms In terms of price, quality and quantity.
As far as a more traditional mom and pop joint like Pann's or the diners surrounding Big Bear Lake, I'd say this comparison is more apples and oranges.

For about $12-15 you will get the largest great tasting breakfast for your money ever.

Thick cut bacon was the selling point for me. Although their Goodyear, AZ location (yes it's a chain restaurant) had bacon twice as thick! It's been years since I have been to their Arizona location. I'm just hoping that their cuts vary and that next time I'll get another steak cut slice! 

Will be back again and again and again and again!"}
{"text":"We went here this past Wednesday and was quite impressed. Great service, food was served hot and the portions were rather generous. The quality or taste was awesome! There were 4 of us and we just ordered 2 plates and shared it, there was no way any one of us could finish 1 plate a piece. This place sure beats HAGG (I'm sure you yelpers will figure it out). Breakfast averages around $9.00, which is quite good considering what you get.....Next time we come back, we'll try something else....

Oh yeah, if you're a coffee lover you should give their coffee a try, you just might like it!

Till next time, happy eating!"}
{"text":"I love the Black Bear Dinner! You can always count on quality food and good fast service. Had a bacon cheeseburger and it was awesome as always. Cooked to perfection and tasty. Our waitress Mindy was on point and recommended a fantastic dessert for my lady, a carmel cookie with ice cream. The onion rings were killer also. One of the more reliable places to eat in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We have eaten in many Black Bear Diners at least 6 different ones and this BBD is the worst by far. It is sad to us because we love BBD and brought a friend and this ones only similarity was the decor.
The service was pretty good and the Restaurant very clean but the food was poorly prepared.
We ordered a few different breakfast items and all had issues. However we were starving by the time the food arrived and so sending it back was not an option since it took so long to get.
My biscuit and gravy scramble consisted of hard biscuits, barely warm coagulated gravy and burnt sausage but my potatoes were great and the eggs cooked perfectly. My husbands chicken fried steak breakfast had way over cooked hash browns and the chicken fried steak was so overly breaded that's all we could taste. All covered with the same not hot enough gravy. My friends hobo omelette was good but his hash browns were also way over cooked and his biscuits hard and covered in. Not quite hot gravy.
BBD this site was a HUGE disappointment."}
{"text":"Another disappointment!!! My husband and I come to have breakfast and was waiting for our food for more than 40 min and everyone that come after us got their food. Finally my husband spoke with the manager that let him know that our waitress forgot to place our order. The manager was nice gave us the food for free for the wait ."}
{"text":"First came to this restaurant over 8 years ago and the food and service is much better than the other restaurants in California.  Mostly get breakfast items as they are so tasty especially the sweet cream pancakes as my kids love them. We always come to eat here to get away from the casinos and have a good meal."}
{"text":"Decided to hit Black Bear before we left Las Vegas. I had the Hobo Omelette. Good breakfast without being too much food. Another good visit. Friendly staff and good food. I look forward to trying another one on a different trip."}
{"text":"I used to live in Las Vegas and can tell you that there's other places (mucho mejor) to have breakfast.
My son lives close to this Diner and wanted to meet here.
His treat sooooo . . .

Wife: Chicken fried steak and eggs
The breading on the CFS was light and crisp, gravy matched well and not overpowering.
Eggs cooked as ordered, potatoes had no crisp at all.
Biscuits looked great but it was very gummy.
Forget the biscuit choose something else
like toast.

Me: Mini-volcano breakfast
Bacon, sausage and egg were cooked to order.
My apologies for being a pancake snob.
Pancakes for me were no bueno.
No crisp to the edges, chewy and rubbery.

Son: Breakfast bowl
Eggs were over cooked.
Biscuit was ... well ... Chewy and gummy.
No bueno for the breakfast bowl.
Service was great. 
Very friendly and coffee was better than usual for a coffee shop.
Very busy on this Saturday morning.
Maybe wait for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This place is great , terrific food n service , Sandor is the best waiter we had the whole trip."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! When you walk in you see all the cool things and a little gift corner and a juke box. The employees are kind and friendly as they walk you to your seat. You wait for a while and your food comes. The food is great and then tou end the day being nice and full."}
{"text":"Return trips to Black Bear Diner have not been as successful as our first. Our food taking a particularly long time to be served and then being overdone when it did arrive. Oh well, everyone can have an off day and I'm sure this was one of them.

The only reason I lowered their score was the pie. Looks wonderful, but in actual fact was some of the worst pie I had ever had and I'd had to pay $6.00 for the privilage! Under-cooked and doughy and the filling had not much in the way of flavour. A Hostess Fruit Pie has more apple flavour than this thing did.

We'll go back of course, that first trip could not have been a fluke, the food will be better on another day I'm sure. Just stay away from the pie."}
{"text":"Ordered a 7oz bacon cheese burger, medium rare, no toppings, with onion rings and a coffee. Then I realized I have a stress test tomorrow at the doctor and couldn't have the coffee after a few sips. Our awesome waitress Marlene promptly ran off a list of non caffeinated drinks, I made a choice and a hassle free switch happened. 

Man, as always my burger was on point. I love a place that understands medium RARE and doesn't over cook the beef. The onion rings and fries I stole from my girl were awesome too! Unfortunately no room for desert today which is a crime because i love the apple cobbler here! This place is really my favorite go-to place when we eat out. Never a disappointment and really consistently good from location to location. The one up near Sahara is just as good."}
{"text":"Last evening we went here for the first time. We entered and the hostess was on the phone taking an order. We stood there for 5 minutes and were about to leave when she finally signaled another employee to come seat us. I assume she heard me say \"let's just leave\" so that is why she finally took action. I also assume the fellow that seated us was the manager    After a few minutes our server came and we liked him immediately. Smiling and friendly. We just asked for water at that time. When he brought the water we ordered. He was helpful in his answers to our questions. He hasn't worked there long so hadn't tried every menu item but did make some good suggestions. About 15 minutes after we ordered he approached me to let me know that they had run out of vegetables I had ordered. So he suggested green beans and I said it was fine. Now, when we were ordering our food, the table next to us was served theirs. A family of 4 with young children. In a few minutes we got a salad with watered down dressing, and a very good corn muffin. But that was it. Remember the folks that were seated next to us? They had finished their meal, had the table cleaned, and were about to leave and we still hadn't been served. Being seated where we were, we could hear the fellow I assumed was the manager telling his kitchen staff what a great job they were doing and that they were \"all caught up\". Funny, we still didn't have our meals, how could they be caught up? So we decided to give it 8 more minutes and then leave. Which we did. We stopped at the hostess station, told her we were leaving, she grimaced and apologized and we left   We won't be back."}
{"text":"Beware of the hokey Biscuit Specials for the month! It's apparently a marketing gimmick for name brand sauces.  The bacon biscuit wit egg and jalapeño is anything BUT vulgar to the sensibilities of anyone... Even if you order the gravy on the side! The whole nasty thing is infused with overt jalapeño heat! A little goes a long way people!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was very good. I had the the Grizz very good and a lot of food the pancakes where tasty. 
Wifey had the veggie omelet everything was sautéed perfectly."}
{"text":"Love this place 
Never had a bad breakfast.. I frequented this place very pregnant and hungry."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I walked in 10 mins before close. The manager and server we polite and friendly. We did not feel rushed at all, except that we need to get our orders in to the server before the kitchen shut down the grill. Other than that, everyone was patient and pleasant. This was my first time dining at Black Bear and I really enjoyed the food. The portions are large, I will be back next time I am in Arizona."}
{"text":"This place rocks, I love the food and the service is awesome. When I first walked in I loved the atmosphere and the food was delicious.  You can get whatever type of meal you want anytime of day. I miss the old Kukendutch but this is very good too.  I enlisted in the Navy back in 1997, at that time this was Kukendutch, but they did a very good job in getting a great place going
I am getting out of the Navy in a few months and I will move close to my favorite eating place.
Check this place out soon."}
{"text":"The dinner that my family and I enjoyed was amazing. The last time we were here was six months ago and I am mad at myself for taking so long to come back. The special for Friday was the All you can eat fish fry. The fish is lightly breaded and seasoned well. The onion rings are great as well. The hush puppies that come with the all you can eat fish fry with fries and hush puppies are the best I have had. The hush puppies are nice and crispy on the outside and soft and cheery on the inside. That's how I like my fried food. Like I said before we will continue to come here and eat. This time it will be in a shorter period of time. Mike our server is amazing. He is helping out many different customers at once but he managed to spend time with each and everyone of us. He is very polite and very attentive even though he had a lot of tables."}
{"text":"Great food and service. James was great and he was a Steelers fan! Can't beat that. The portions are great for sharing because they are so large and yummy. I have yet to have a bad meal here."}
{"text":"The service was friendly and the food was great.  I was pleasantly surprised.  More of a local spot away from the hussle.  It is about 4 miles from the strip, close to The Orleans."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time! Soooo good! 
We had a TON of food- classic eggs benedict, the Grizz, along with a side of biscuits and gravy. We left feeling happy and extremely full. Can't wait to come back again :-) Also ask to sit in Brett's section- he's friendly and excited to serve the best breakfast food ever!"}
{"text":"Love this place, never had a bad meal here. Portions  are huge. Great service, friendliest people around. I suggests the chicken fried steak. So tasty and the biscuits and bravery ate amazing also. Try one of their wonderful pies, you'll have to take it to go though, you'll be to fill to ready it there. My favorite if the banana cream. They ate all wonderful though."}
{"text":"One would think that on a Wednesday evening and a party of 11 comes in, the manager would help out the 1 waitperson on duty. No, he's outside with a buddy on his phone. Food is always good but tonight's service was horrible. The waitperson was very nice and kept apologizing.  This manager should really learn what management is all about."}
{"text":"If you're looking for comfort food at a reasonable price this is the place for you.  I had the fried chicken...with mixed results.  Two of the three pieces were juicy and delicious.  The other piece was dry and unpalatable.  The mashed potatoes and gravy was quite tasty and the salad was pretty fresh.  I didn't care too much for the corn bread...but ultimately it was a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"First time here. We liked it a lot. But I should have tried a smaller dish. The portion size was enormous!! Next time I come I'll be sure to be extra hungry. Haha"}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here three times in the last month, and we think it's just incredible. Service is good, waits are low even on busy days, food is amazing, portions are huge. We really love it. We always take home a pie after we eat there, to enjoy for a couple days afterward."}
{"text":"Came in for a traditional breakfast.  Portions are large, staff was very polite.  Waitress stayed on top of the coffee, and my friend and I had an awesome meal."}
{"text":"Been going to the BBD for a while now.  Favorite thing is their cheap prices.  

Breakfast food is real good here too.  I have never had to wait longer than 5 minutes for a table.  Normally there is no wait whatsoever.

The Griz is amazing and it like 50lbs of meat and egg for your morning pleasure.  

Fridays are the Fish Fry and apparently its like $8.99 for unlimited fish!  You get some fries and hush puppies yum

Come on in and get a coffee.  Enjoy your dinner with a cold beer or a fluffy bear.  Whatever floats your boat."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast spot if you don't want to wait in line at a buffet or brunch location!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food, service, and atmosphere. Went here with a group and had an awesome time! I really recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was happy with the experience, but if I had invested a bazillion dollars in a new business I would make the food and service a minimum of ten star all around. The fish was good, the chips were blah; there is no good chips made from mashed potatoes, the tartar sauce was excellent, the service was excellent. I will go there again, but not without a coupon."}
{"text":"Amazing service and great portions for the price. The waitress frequently checked up on us throughout the entire meal. We got the Grizz and the Chicken Fried Steak 2 Egg Combo. Very filling! Will definitely be coming by again."}
{"text":"First breakfast in Vegas this year and it was wonderful! Great food great service clean!!! Just wonderful!!!!"}
{"text":"Consistently great for breakfast!  Be prepared to wait on weekend mornings, especially for Mothers & Fathers day."}
{"text":"For our first breakfast joint in Phoenix, my fiancée and I stopped here yesterday morning. We decided to split the Denver omelette as she is adjusting to American-sized portions (she's from Korea). Luckily we did split it because the generous portion size was definitely overwhelming. The service was spot on and our server was the nicest as she walked through the menu with us and offered suggestions."}
{"text":"Great place! Huge portions! Depending on what time/day you go there might be a big wait but it's definitely worth it"}
{"text":"The food here is great ad service is always good. Try the sweet cream waffle or the French toast. They used to have cinnamon roll French toast that was to die for but for some reason felt the need to change it to bear claw French toast which is only fair."}
{"text":"I love black bear. Every time I come here makes me miss my moms cooking. The portion size is huge, and I always have leftovers. We went on a Sunday morning and it was busy, so service was a little slow but understandable because they were running in circles. I will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Not to loud .
Basic diner food.
Coffee way too hot.
Burger was pretty good. 
Service was mediocre"}
{"text":"Excellent food service was great as well. Serving is enough to share. There was a long wait about 45 minutes but it was well worth it.  Pancakes were perfect too."}
{"text":"Stopped into the Black Bear Diner while out shopping during lunch time.  My kids were really excited to be able to have pancakes for lunch, sadly we were all disappointed. 

My kids ordered: Mini volcano with scrambled egg.  The pancakes were hard and tasteless, the egg was like rubber, the sausage was shriveled and hard (like it had been over cooked and then sat).

I ordered:  The turkey pesto sandwich with fries.  Overall the sandwich was OK, I'm grateful the waitress suggested I switch out the turkey for deli sliced, as if it was the thick slices it would have been very hard to eat.  The sandwich fell apart, and the bread was a bit too hard.  The fries were good.

We also had a chocolate shake, which was OK..... it had a very minimal chocolate flavor. 

We ordered these 2 meals, and it took us an hour and 15 minutes..... wait time was way too long given the restaurant was not even busy when we were there.  

Prices were ok.  

We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Where have you been my whole life Black ? I can't believe that I've been sleeping on QUALITY food and Supreme service by Ms. Marlene. I'm a Las Vegas local and this place makes my tummy happy and the music makes me want to travel back to the good old days . THANK YOU to the night shift all the ladies were kind and caring. PS GOD bless the cook for that is craft is GOOD."}
{"text":"Rarely can you walk into a restaurant that is so busy and still get excellent service. We were a party of 11 and got seated right away.  The manager, Don, was so accommodating and kind. Food was excellent, service excellent!!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat for breakfast. Always have great customer service when we go there. Always friendly and nice. We've always been seated right away, and it's always on Sunday around 10:30-11am. My kids love the free balloons. My favorite is the Country Fried Steak with that gravy! Yummmmmm!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch it was ok. The servers were nice. The atmosphere was cute. Breakfast prices seemed reasonable lunch prices were a little pricey for the sides and meals for my taste."}
{"text":"Have dined many times at this restaurant and been very satisfied.  However I ate a bowl of chili that made me very sick.  I called the diner to talk to the manager and told him about the chili.  He did not even apologize and rudely said \"I will look into it\" and hung up.  Not good customer service."}
{"text":"I ordered the chorizo scramble and got a side of hair in my food. Sent the good back and ordered something different. That was much better. Then when we received the bill they took off the chorizo scramble but had the nerve to still charge me for my meal. 
My family was already done eating by the time I got my meal. The least they could do was take my meal off. I told the waitress to take it off and she did but the problem is I had to tell her. Seriously?! I had hair in my food and she didn't even apologize. The customer service was horrible. The only reason I didn't give it a 1 is because there was nothing wrong with my families food. I don't think I will be coming back here."}
{"text":"It's the best pancakes ever and orange juice love it waitress was really sweet and kind and it's always clean I love going there with my husband or with the family is a great place to go"}
{"text":"We were worried about all the yelp reviews reflecting \"poor service\" at this location/place but we went anyways to try the Friday night fish fry....WOW!!! Tahra was one of the best servers we have experienced in Las Vegas!!!! We arrived, we were seated and were sitting for awhile...waiting...waiting....waiting.....Tahra noticed the server from our section was not acknowledging us and came over and was AWESOME!!!! Even though we were not in her designated section she served us with the greatest of personal / professional skills...she made us feel welcome and her customer service skills were excellent!!! The food was very good but Tahra made the \"Black Bear Diner experience\" a very pleasant night out! If you go there ask for Tahra and you will not be disappointed! The fish was excellent, the portions are great, the price is well worth it! We are for sure going back next week."}
{"text":"Really good food.  If you are tired of the Vegas Strip eateries, try Black Bear.  Inexpensive & Delicious staple on my eateries in Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"UnBEARable Service  & Food ..Yuk !  why did I ever go in that place, this was like a month ago...... I asked for OJ , we don't have any. My omelette came with Avocados , sorry no avocados... how a bout my wheat toast please? sorry , you want white ??  My Country Potatoes not cooked and half raw. My wife's hashbrown not cooked well . Wanted to get out of there , the waitress, it's like if we weren't there. She kept Yaking with her freind. Just a disaster.... i'm sorry, but no Black Bear for me ...ever !.."}
{"text":"Great brunch or breakfast place. My family and I love coming here on the weekend for a good breakfast. The only draw back is that they are quite busy and don't take reservation on the weekends.

I always get the chicken fried steak with eggs. Good hash browns as well!"}
{"text":"This place is heaven on earth... as soon as you walk in the staff greets you and makes you feel like Family!!! I had the pleasure of having the services of Ms Marlene she makes you feel like kin!!!! I had the meatloaf plate it tasted like i had it straight out of grandma's kitchen... it was sooo good!!!! Your tastebuds and stomach will appreciate everything about  black bear dinner.... Thank you Ms. Marlene for making me feel like family your service was excellent!!!! I will be back to this gem of a place!!!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place since it's next to the library. I got the tri tip sandwich with all the fixing of grilled onions and provlone with a side of onion rings.  The food is A-OK. It's decent not spectacular, typical American diner food. 3 stars for food.

I like the atmosphere and the staff. Black Bear diner has its branding game on point. The thematic country lodge feel is quite homey. The staff were really attentive and friendly. 

I'd reckon they're packed for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great Service Great Food Cindy Rae was great as always. Told Jokes and kept us entertained."}
{"text":"This place rocks! We had the corned beef hash and eggs with home fries and was served a platter covered wall to wall with food. The hash was excellent! Ordered a side of their spicy homemade breakfast sausage patties and it was AWESOME, the best I've ever had ANYwhere! 

We are definitely looking forward to our return to PHX Metro to experience them again!"}
{"text":"Decent food. It is definitely a neighborhood diner. I usually go for the biscuits and gravy! They are delicious!!"}
{"text":"I had great experience, I ordered  bear's choice two eggs with your choice of Pancakes, Sweet Cream Waffle or French toast, from breakfast menu. I chose French toast and was so good and tasty."}
{"text":"The best place in Vegas for breakfast (just check out a Sat, or Sun. morning!) be sure to go early or expect a wait, even though it is worth it. Also make sure you go hungry. Their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite.
But don't just go for breakfast, their lunch and dinner items are to die for. They always treat you nice here, no matter how busy. They offer great value in dining out. These are the kind of people we need more of here in Vegas."}
{"text":"Simply great food. Waitress was totally on it. She timed everything perfectly. My new go to place for simple, comfortable home cooked tasting food.  Worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent. Never go wrong with The Black Bear. We had biscuits & gravy. Eggs bacon. Waffle. Real fresh squeezed OJ. And our server 'Sandor' was the best! Reflects on great management!"}
{"text":"First thing I noticed walking into BlackBear was their Desert Display. It all looked so good, the host greeted me, asked me where I'd like to sit, signaled over the section and there I went. Think I was sitting there for almost 5 minutes without a menu or anyone in site. Was even contemplating whether or not to leave since that is always a bad sign. Finally my server appears was really friendly, attentive making suggestions. The menu was pretty basic, nothing was appealing I was even thinking of just getting a pie since those looked better than the food options. Nevertheless went with coffee and the California Chicken Avocado BLT minus the bacon on sourdough. Restaurant started to pick up, when I got there no one was there. The food was very bland, nothing stood out to me, regretted not waiting 20 more minutes for Trader Joe's to open. Unfortunately my server kind of forgot about me, she had given me my receipt when I was eating my food and I guess you pay at the host desk. Was waiting for her to come by to ask for a box since the portions are huge to only have her skip me as she checked on all the other tables around me. That was the moment 30% went to 15%. Nothing stood out to me, got so so service and don't think I'd go back to a Black Bear Dinner again."}
{"text":"Over priced and the food is below average. Steak and Eggs. Steak was raw asked for medium and the hash brown soaking in oil... The biscuit was like eating cardboard made fresh daily ? OUCH!!! The eggs made out ok over easy... waitress was nice...  No return visits much better places near by... JK KUHL thumbs down."}
{"text":"Hair in my food- yuck! Service was great and food would have been good without the large piece of hair."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for awhile.  I was not disappointed at all! The staff was amazing!  I ordered the pancakes with eggs and bacon! The hash browns were delicious!  I know  I will be coming back to visit! Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"The Black Bear Diner is a great breakfast spot for vacationers looking for an off the strip experience with friendly, local pricing and service! A $10 Uber away from the major attractions is well worth it. Food was fresh and plentiful! Sweet cream pancakes are awesome. The fresh squeezed OJ and a healthy serving of grease are what you need to forget your Hangover!"}
{"text":"Good, simple food, and lots of it.
Clean and comfy, and an always-friendly staff.

Great choice for a HUGE American-style breakfast.

The menu is not as diverse or interesting as Weiss - across the street.
\"Eat\" downtown does a far more fun and trendy meal. But as far as  diner fare goes, this is a rock-solid choice.

This is where I will bring my Midwestern parent when they visit. They'll be very happy."}
{"text":"Always good. Had a patty melt. It was very good. Honey had his favorite, chicken fried steak and eggs..  Staff very attentive."}
{"text":"Kids eat free on Tuesday nights. This was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"This was a good place for a late evening meal with friends. The black bear cabin-y decor is corny, but cute. 

This place is exactly what you think of when you hear \"diner.\" I would like to come back again for breakfast, but I imagine I already know how the experience will be. I had a club sandwich with turkey and avocado and my husband had chicken and waffles. From my photos you'll see it was one waffle with chicken tenders. Not surprising, and he ate it all, but it's always fun to see a restaurant put their own unique spin on it. My measure of success is: Can I make this at home? :)

I will say, service was great. Food was good enough. PIES are little \"single-serve\" pies, but definitely shareable and delicious."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Black Bear Diner's in California and thought that I would give this one a go. I like consistency and home style food was needed! Heading to Black Bear seemed perfect.

We were seated immediately upon arrival. Our waitress was friendly. Our food came out fast. The iced tea was just okay...

I'm docking one star for cleanliness....the bears that line the wall are filthy with dust...so much dust. 

Other than that, parking was good, the place was packed and the food was exactly as I had expected...and needed after getting off of a very early flight from California."}
{"text":"My In-law came in from Kingman, AZ to visit and took us out to eat. He loves Black Bear and first started to frequent these restaurants in Lake Havasu.... Unfortunately, he was dissapointed.

The portions at this restaurant, although it is a chain, are smaller... same menu though... And as I write this review me and my wife are in bed sick (it must have been their food because it was the only thing we ate today). 

Love their coconut cream pie! Would go back ANY day...  just, please, standarize the portions =)  We go strictly for their huge burgers and taco salads, which are usually great!"}
{"text":"only giving 3 stars..no alcohol at any of vegas locations!
People.... this is Vegas! 
Food great, large portions."}
{"text":"Always love the black bear diner. We were staying on the strip and it was a little bit of a drive from there but well worth it ! Our food was great and not over priced at all. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Took my parents on a Monday to black bear dinner on priest and elliot in Tempe , Nice place, Short staffed took 40 minutes to be seated ,Ther was clearly plenty tables avalible but we still had to wait , When we ordered we asked for crispy,crunchy hash browns,our eggs where runny again for the second time the hash browns where not fully cooked , I took them home to fry them my self , this is the third time in a row I been there and we had to send something back . the staff apologized for being short handed , My parents have  diabetes and need to eat ,so waiting 35 to 40 minutes to order and then waiting for the food , If you are diabetic you might wanna bring a snack for the wait last time entry plus exit time 1.5 hours, Customers from the neighborhood , thank you very much"}
{"text":"You must try their bear claw almond!! It's so good! Went on a Tuesday with my mom so it wasn't busy. We both ordered their corned beef hash which came with 2 eggs, biscuit or toast, and a choice of either hashbrowns or country potatoes. I thought the serving was fairly big and decently priced. Food was good, but the corned beef hash was a little too dry for my taste. We did end up taking home our left over and my mom recooked hers they way she liked it. Customer service was great, waitress was attentive. I'd come back to eat here."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was excellent !! Don the manager is very good at what he does .... Very attentive ..always circling the dining room making sure that everyone is happy..   Black bear diner is very lucky to have him ....  Thanks for being so nice to our messy kids....."}
{"text":"Tried this place out. It was ok. Nothing special. I asked for extra butter and syrup since they gave me a tiny 2 oz container for my 3 stack pancake. The server acted like I was asking for a million dollars and wanted to charge me for extra syrup. She even took long when it was just me and 2 other customers in the whole restaurant. Can't stand bad service."}
{"text":"Other Diners beware- this is how it's done!  Food was outstanding and the service was VERY FAST!  I just had the meat lovers omelet, and that thing was stuffed to the hilt with Sausage, Bacon, Ham and of course, Eggs and Cheese, and it did NOT taste reheated, microwaved, or like there were cheap ingredients used, quality stuff here.  My wife got the Cinnamon Roll French Toast, She loved it and couldn't finish it because there was so much freaking good stuff to enjoy.  Definitely will be back as this place is THE place to go- worth the trip from Henderson!"}
{"text":"What's not 2 like about a home~cooked meal in nice cabin~style atmosphere? Upon entering this establishment a 1derful combin8ion of smells welcomes ur senses w/ warm inviting outdoorsy earthy tones that makes u wanna get comfortable & stay awhile.

   We were promptly greeted then seated by the pleasant hostess @ a nice cushy booth where we acticip8ed viewing all the options 2 select from. I've been here a couple of Xs once 4 breakfast & another 4 lunch. Our friendly w8tress who greeted us took our drink orders filling us in on the specials, leaving us more time 2 decipher what we wanted 2 go w/.

   I finally decided 2 start w/ a breakfast pastry called a cherry bear~claw which certainly didn't disappoint, then a vegetarian omelette w/ sliced avocado on top ~ fresh quality & complimentary ingredients that made my taste~buds sing. 

   I've also had the oh~so~YUMMY California Benedict (minus the bacon) which is an English Muffin w/ spinach, grilled tomato, avocado, 2 poached eggs smothered in hollandaise sauce, fluffy biscuits & flavorful gravy, cinnamon roll french toast, sweet cream waffle/pancakes ~ all which were golden Perfection & sweetness (of course u can always go overboard w/ the syrup if u choose, but it's the Good stuff ~ no artificial fake nasty after~taste sweeteners here)...

   My personal Fave is the Harvest Tossed Salad which has dried cranberry, cherry, blueberry, golden raisin, mushroom, bell pepper, onion, almond, walnut & pecan in a lite honey Dijon dressing topped w/ fresh strawberries/toasted coconut & will always make room 4 their delectable signature secret recipe home~made bread pudding w/ pecan praline sauce!!  Sorry if this makes u saliv8 but this is my sampling of an Amazing place w/ Awesome food complete w/ Gr8 service/atmosphere @ a very reasonable cost 2 boot & find myself thinking often of going back more than I get 2..."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Black Bear I heard a lot about their Chicken Fried steak.... I'm kind of   A CFS guru and have been looking for a place for CFS since the Firehouse closed in Tempe. Road house comes close. With that being said my experience at BB was as follows. Service was Great! The CFS was ok it should be served with corn not any other vegetables. The mashed potatoes were cold. So the search goes on for a place that can at least compete with the old Firehouse. Next on the list is a place in down town Vegas located inside the Union Plaza I've been told there's a CFS place that's awesome and if you can finish it , it's free.
Couple of other things I noted we bought couple of bear claws from their counter bakery they were wrapped very tightly so we couldn't tell if they were fresh or not, Theye weren't. They were like bricks even after 30 seconds in the MW. Needless to say we won't be returning any time soon!"}
{"text":"I don't care for the hillbilly atmosphere at all. But the food is good,  large portions and more than fair prices. And they have a huge selection. Good place if you have lots of people who can't always agree."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! My family and I love black bear diner ever since we tried it in the Bay Area. The other black bear diner in town is a little far from our place, so we were so excited to see this one opening near us. Amazing customer service, Laura was an amazing server!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic! Excellent place to stop for breakfast off the strip. Be advised, the portions are huge! The pancakes are not your typical buttermilk, they are much sweeter and fluffier, but completely delicious. Eggs and bacon were cooked perfectly. Would have been 5 stars, but on a busy Sunday morning, we were told the wait would be 15 minutes. 35 minutes later, after noticing people getting called back who had arrived after us, I checked on our wait only to find out they had completely skipped over our name and called like 6 people back ahead of us. We only got a half-ass apology as well. Service could be improved, but the food speaks for itself."}
{"text":"Great selection, huge portions.  Food was very savory.  Service was excellent and they were all very friendly.  For a family of five we paid literally half of what we normally would pay at any other restaurant.  Come with an appetite for sure.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I enjoy Black Bear diner, but I specifically enjoy THIS location because of Marlene! Simply stated, she's wonder-woman. We've been in a few times to have a bite, but our last visit on 3/30 was an especially busy evening. Even though they seemed a bit short-handed, Marlene did a superb job attending to all her tables. She even accommodated my husband's request for \"sweeter\" sweet tea. 

Bottomline: I highly recommend visiting THIS Black Bear Diner for a nice, affordable meal...and if possible, sit in Marlene's section.

Note: there is a Black Bear Diner within 3 miles of my house, but I pass it by to drive over twice the distance to this location because of Marlene :)"}
{"text":"Really improved. I had not been here in a long while. We stopped going as to us it seemed to be going down hill. 
We did venture back last weekend and to our surprise it was very good. They have some new menu items, new hostess and servers. Which was a huge plus. The previous hostess was about as friendly as a hungry bear. 
Our server Dawn was awesome, when I asked what she thought about a dish she was very honest and told me to stay away from it. 
I had the stuffed chicken with broccoli hollandaise sauce and it was excellent. The portions are still huge. I could not finish all of the food. 
The prices are still affordable. Will be going back."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Nothing to rave about. The services was decent. They were busy, but the server was still very friendly. I don't think I would be back."}
{"text":"I came to Black Bear Diner tonight on Friday specifically for their fish fry dinner that they just sent me the email on either today or yesterday.  This dinner starts at 4 p.m. and here they are sold out already before 6:15 p.m.  This is very poor planning on their part.

I would not even bother coming here on a Friday if that is what you are looking for unless you get here right at 4 p.m...."}
{"text":"Holy cow. I thought service that bad didn't exist in Chandler anymore. We sat down and no one even stopped by to take our drink order. After 10 minutes we got up and left. They weren't even busy, maybe 10 tables at the most. I made eye contact with our waitress 3 different times and she still never came by. As a Hispanic I have never felt more uncomfortable at a restaurant in my 26 years of living here in Chandler. Never again."}
{"text":"Terrible service, terrible quantity, & so slow. I sat at the service seats by the kitchen & watched food coming up for 35 minutes messed up, burnt toast, fruit just sitting up there, pancakes sitting there & they said, \"I don't know who they go to so just give them to the next person. I ordered an egg white ham & cheese omelet & a side of fruit. Very simple!!! After waiting and watching a male employee sneezing repeatedly right next to the food into the sink with no covered face he grabbed plates & took food out. Seeing what I thought was my fruit & omelet for 5 minutes sitting up there it ended up being the smallest omelet I ever saw & the cheese & ham were cold & not even melted on the top of the omelet. I live across the street from there & will never go back."}
{"text":"How can you screw up on omelette???  Then I'm told I should have ordered a scramble!!  Well, put that in the description!  And when the waitresses are asked confrontation of what is what they don't let you know...  it's really ridiculous that orders can be right... Each time I have ordered from there every item has been burnt or items like toast or side orders are wrong
 Breakfast items are so overpriced...  if a large party forget getting all your items at the same time.  Ordered eggs over easy, had to wait another 10 minutes for the side of bread... eggs were then cold abs when requested fresh eggs I was told no.  

Another time I ordered eggs over easy, it was burnt.  
Won't return after giving the place multiple tries.


Cheeseburger was placed under hot lamp and bun was burnt."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night.. Well tried too. Seated by the host person and waited 15 minutes. Servers all around us and they didn't ask one time for a drink order let alone come over the our table. Finally got served by the host girl and 15 minutes later still no food order. Manager never even left the back office. Pathetic service and will NEVER return here. Extremely disappointed and will be writing to their corporate office. 
This is my first yelp review and sadly it's not a good one."}
{"text":"Service was great! Food was extremely good! Portions are huge. Very nice diner to go eat. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Super great place to eat for any meal. The parking is a little crazy, and the wait can be long sometimes, but once your seated you will receive great food and quick service."}
{"text":"For a Memorial Day weekend it was pretty packed, the hostes was super sweet and seated us right away. Our waitress Candy seemed very rushed and it took a while to get our order in. The food came out very fast and it looked absolutely delish! Big portions but well worth the wait. Although our food was yummy I couldn't get over the customer service from our waitress, I've been working in customer service for a while now and I know customers are King & Queen, I didn't feel too cared for. More like a burden. Thank you for the yummy food team."}
{"text":"I had been to the original in Mt Shasta many times years ago, so when my husband suggested it for an early dinner, I was all for it.
I ordered the California burger with cole slaw. My husband the chicken fried steak. It took about half an hour to get our food. It was barely warm. I couldn't find the hamburger patty under all the lettuce. No cheese and the bun was a little stale. The cole slaw was very vinegary.
And to top it off, my drink refill was wrong.  Normally I would have sent the back but it took so long I was starving.
I won't be back"}
{"text":"I like that they remember my name when I return. Most of the food is good.  My mom did not like the Chicken Pop Pie. They serve large portions. There is usually a wait on Sundays.  I usually eat there once a week for lunch. Sadly, they removed the Caeser Chicken Salad from the menu."}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast.  I had bacon and eggs while wife had the daily special, both were very.  

Staff was quick and efficient.  Food was delivered in what I consider to be record time.

While the food was good it wasn't great but definitely will return and try a lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"Saw the advertisements for BB Diner on Baseline.  The place was not busy at all at 430 pm xmas eve.  A party of 4, took 20 min for 3 of us to get served, 25 min for the 4th...the last order was wrong, after 10 min, cancelled it...my meal was cold, cheap on the gravy but overall good amiunt of food.  The issue was tbe quality of the kitchen staffs skills.   This visit will be memorable if for nothing else that tbe manager took 50% off the bill. ....he should pay me next time to eat here.  You have been warned."}
{"text":"Great food, service and prices.   This place is a home run when it comes to breakfast"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast two mornings this week.

Tried the egg white omelette and apple claw- both delicious.  Price was reasonable and the waitress Cindie was hospitable in the Old South way- which was a refreshing change.

2nd time tried the waffles and pancakes- huge portions and great taste.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Good old fashioned country style diner. Everything is prepared fresh to order and of course the service is what you would expected from a country atmosphere. Try the tri-dipped Sandwich; it is pretty good and juicy. Everyone in our party was happy with their freshly prepared meal."}
{"text":"Had to try the sweet cream pancakes and I'm so glad that I did! I also enjoyed the California scramble. If you are looking for an incredible meal, warm and friendly atmosphere off the strip then come here. Be prepared for a wait if you venture out at a peak dining hour, it's worth waiting for."}
{"text":"This place is terrible.  Why do they make such a big deal about portion sizes when the burger basket is basically a Burger King size.  Don't get me wrong, it's filling af, but not to the degree that they try and sell it to you and market it to you.  Don't waste your money here.  You are paying for the experience, and honestly, you can get the same amount of food at Burger King, same quality.  The manager won't harass you for leaving a review on yelp and stare at you every time you walk by the establishment.  The Burger King manager doesn't care.  Black bears manager?  Takes it personally and makes you feel sorry for having a bad experience.  Too bad.  

If you would like a place to hang out after Burger King, check out a coffee shop, go to the library, or take some yoga at RYK, right across the street.  You will spend the same amount of money (because black bear is over priced for its portions), and you will feel social:-))"}
{"text":"Everything I've had has been amazing! Especially fond of the Cinnamon Roll French Toast. It's literally a cinnamon roll sliced and fried like French toast. Omg. Steak and eggs was real good too. Can be a greasy spoon depending on what you get"}
{"text":"Bottom line I've never been disappointed in this place. They certainly hire staff that are friendly and quick to take your order and cooks that know what they're doing."}
{"text":"I'm giving them 2 stars only because I have been there before and it wasn't horrible. This visit was disgusting! The restaurant is dirty, our food came out cold and tasteless, and the service was the worst! She did not offer coffee or soda refills she had a scowl on her face the entire time, until she brought the check that is! Honestly I will never go back."}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner is one of my favorite restaurants in town.  The food is AMAZING. The manager Don and his team are nothing short of extraordinary.  Don goes out of his way to greet every guest with a high-five or hug, and every child with a balloon.  He makes every visit fun and memorable.  It is because of Don that we return week after week and it is also why my family from out of town and I will be having Thanksgiving dinner there. We can't recommend Black Bear Diner enough.  If I had to find one flaw, I guess it would be when Don isn't there and another Manager covers for him.  The restaurant just doesn't run the same. I've met several of the other Managers and they don't have the same outgoing and fun personality that Don has.  If you're looking for a delicious family oriented restaurant, Black Bear Diner is a MUST!!!"}
{"text":"Great Homestyle food reasonable prices. Everything always seems like it's fresh made love the tri tip"}
{"text":"I enjoyed a steak meal for $19 something. Good but medium rare was medium and they frogot my cornbread."}
{"text":"AWESOME! Everyone here is friendly, the food is wonderful (with very generous portions), and the prices are great! The manager, Don, was extremely outgoing and personable and made the trip there fantastic!"}
{"text":"We LOVE The Black Bear!  Just left and were very pleased!!!!!  They are quick and delish! The quality is GREAT!!!  Our sever Amy was extremely sweet and remembered everything without writing a single thing down!  Can't wait to go back (:"}
{"text":"Went in late night around 9pm. I was still greeted with happy smiles. Service was amazing. A very homelike place.
The only problem is going late night is that they are cleaning and vacuuming at the hour so when I'm relaxing I overhear a vacuum on the other side of the room. Overall I could definitely get over that. Food was nice and fresh. Our waitress was SUPER friendly. Had having a bad experience at a different location, this one made me better about coming to this restaurant again. I do wish with a big menu that they have more specialty drinks alcohol or non alcohol.  Just to keep up with the uniqueness of the place. 
Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Had the Meat Lovers Omelette (Good) with extra crispy hash browns (needed extra extra crispy) and fruit. I also got a side order of their thick bacon (extra crispy) (Great) Good chain for Breakfast."}
{"text":"Great, fresh eggs prepared perfectly medium well, an order many diner cooks seem to struggle to execute. High quality breakfast meats, pleasant service."}
{"text":"Everyone keeps saying \"everything is good...\" I'm not sold... The pancakes were the best thing... Good honey, vanillla taste to them, but fluffy... If you like that sort of thing. The hash browns were decent as were the parmesan chips... The turkey burger was not fabulous... Pre-processed, thin, dry patty without flavor.  Bacon was chewy and fatty.  I most likely wpnt return.  Also every plate had a slice of orange and lettuce on it... Old school Shoney's style... Not sure why they add this... Very wasteful and not really much of a show..."}
{"text":"Came back a second time for lunch and I'm liking this place even more. Waitress was really nice and prompt. And they've got a pretty good Reuben going on."}
{"text":"Came here since I have been at another diner in the past. So came here for some dessert and it was not bad for price but service sucked. When server asks only dessert in a tone like that's it. There weren't many customers so you would think the 5 workers we saw would be attentive, nope. The guy came 3 times once to take order, give coffee and dessert and never came back no refills nothing but did have time to drop off check and ask need anything else. Yea how about good service."}
{"text":"Again we came to take our chances on service and capped out!  The entire dining room was open however we had a 10 min wait because we were only 2 and those were reserved for larger parties....it always seems to be that when Heather manages this takes place...our server Cathy left something to be desired....thank God the food was good!"}
{"text":"The first time I came I waited 30-40 minutes on a busy Nascar morning. I had that morning the yummiest fluffiest blueberry sweet cream pancakes & loved them. Forgot all about the wait & returned on another busy Sunday a.m. and had the biscuits & gravy. Totally worth the 20 minute wait. Yum! The biscuits are ginormous fluffy perfection. The gravy was thick with sausage & just great. The third time was another 15 minute wait on this 2012 president's day Monday. The parking lot was busy but not like on the weekends. There were some empty booths/tables but this time the wait was not worth the breakfast even a little. I ordered the \"special\" and was sorely disappointed. It was the chili omelet served with their usual potato & bread choice and the omelet left me sad faced. The chili was not good. It was missing spice & a very basic but necessary spice (salt). Just tasteless, bland blah! The server Kathy whom we've had previously and rocked was over sat by the host stand so the service sucked too. Bummer too because it wasn't the server but the hosts. I'm sure she can handle her share of tables but it was one after another no staggering. Obvious training issue there that I hope at some point they get straightened out."}
{"text":"Nice, clean restaurant we had breakfast at today. Huge meals. Nice coffee. Great for kids. Enjoyed it and would recommend it but beware the meals are huge!"}
{"text":"So good!! I remember going to one of the locations when I was younger, so I had to give this one a try. I'm not a huge fan of French fries, but theirs are super good. Being from the north, I love the theme of the restaurant too."}
{"text":"I've meant to check this place out for quite a while. Today I gave it a try, and I'm absolutely happy that I did.
When I walked in, there were quite a lot of people waiting for tables, so I automatically assumed it would be a long wait. 
However, I was pleased to see that the wait was very short. 
They had many staff members that were all working very hard and had great hospitality. 
The place was clean and well organized. 
I ordered a burger and fries and hot tea. All of the above were absolutely amazing!! One of the best burgers I've ever had, in fact! 
I totally loved this place and will assuredly be back!!"}
{"text":"The other BBD in town isn't too far from us, but my husband and I wanted to try this location out, since it was a little bit closer.

When we first arrived, it was about a 20 - 35 minute wait, which was fine. Although I will say, we did show up rather late. It was almost noon on a Saturday. 

When we got our table, we looked over the menu for about 3 - 5 minutes before my husband asked another server if we could have our waitress, and that was just to order our drinks. Once we ordered our food, we didn't anticipate our food coming out immediately.

Like the other BBD, the food here is great. I ordered the New York Steak and my husband ordered the Grizz, both were delicious and filling. Our waitress stopped by a few times to make sure everything was good, so that was nice. Unfortunately, when we finished eating, it took 20 minutes to get two to-go boxes and our check.

All in all, the experience here wasn't horrible, but I think my husband and I will stick with the green valley location. If you do decide to try this location, I'd suggest maybe coming a lot earlier, unless you don't mind the wait. Again, it was practically lunch time when we arrived."}
{"text":"My family and I love Black Bear Diner, wish there where more of them in the valley. I particularly like the chicken fried steak, I get it almost everytime"}
{"text":"My family and I went to black bear last weekend on Sunday. Our server was great, however,  the lady that works there Christine kept staring at me and giving me a dirty look.  My dad noticed and asked why she would do that, and what her problem with me was,  him never being to this location.  (I Also am not aware of why Christine would act this way toward me) Then asked if she would had the nerve to do something to my food bc of the looks she was giving me.  It wss a very uncomfortable dining experience  and she wasn't even our server.  I also heard her in the back saying the worst thing about her tables, she needs to watch what she says bc she is offensive and what she says might be hurtful if the people in her section actually heard her, that is not acceptable in my opinion and should be taken care of, she needs to watch her language in a family restaurant.  We will not be back, i do not even want to know what she said about me after i left."}
{"text":"What a huge disappointment!  We were looking forward to this restaurant as it recently opened in Chandler.   Unfortunately, the food was just awful.  I had the Chicken Pot Pie, which barely had any chicken in it.  Immediately, upon eating it, my stomach began to hurt and I went to use the facilities at the restaurant. 

Well, Big Bear Diner, you can't run a restaurant when the one and only toliet you have in the mens room is broken.   The employee in the bathroom didn't seem too concerned that the one toliet was broken.

We left the restaurant right away. Not a great start!"}
{"text":"Like their breakfast.  Lunch and dinner not so much.  They have always overcooked my entree."}
{"text":"Came in for a simple lunch and turned it around to be breakfast, our server Darien we ordered our food but our server put it together by his choices the meal turned out really well, very nice gentleman very good service, we will return and I read suggest for anybody that was hungry this would be a place to come"}
{"text":"So me and my son's have become regulars. Everything I've had (trying something new every visit)  has been excellent! Sons love everything too,  especially the kids Tri Tip,  and kids steak.  My favorite is probably the pot roast. For some extra kick,  put some honey with a little papa burn sauce (habanero) on the cornbread! Don't forget,  Tuesday,  free kid Neal with each adult meal.  Try the huckleberry (berry) ice cream too!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. I had the 2 Eggs with Linguica and the sausage was superb. Hash Browns were solid. Biscuits were HUGE but lacked flavor and were REALLY dry.  Couldn't even spread jelly on them without them crumbling to bits. Wife had the California Bacon Benedict and it was top notch. 

Good.portions. Prices solid. You won't leave hungry unless you try really hard. 

Not the best breakfast in Vegas but solid."}
{"text":"It's ok.  

If you don't want to wait an hour and a half to go to Matts big breakfast downtown this place will be just fine."}
{"text":"Great little diner over in Spring Valley. I have only had breakfast here and it has always been good, the Eggs Benedict and \"The Grizz\" usually. \"The Grizz\" is a lot of food, perfect if you are a big hungry bear like myself or if you want to split it down the middle with your companion. 

I would say this is my second favorite diner in Las Vegas after the 24 hour Peppermill."}
{"text":"This place is pretty popular on the weekends. The wait time isn't too bad. For some reason, this time around the hostess didn't have a set answer to when we would be seated, but we probably waited around 15 mins... not too bad for a Saturday. 

I ordered the Huevos Rancheros. It came with two corn tortillas, chorizo, ordered my eggs over easy, chili verde sauce, avocados, and cherry tomatoes; with a side of hash brown and fruit. My first thought is that it looks so delicious! As I was cutting into it, the corn tortilla was fried and hard to cut through. Not sure if it was supposed to be hard or soft, but either way it added a nice crunch to it. 

My dad ordered the Pot Roast, Mushroom, and Onion Hash with a side of parmesan garlic bread. My mom ordered the California Omelet with a side of fruit and a pancake (*not pictured). 

Our service was kind of slow. It seemed like they were short staffed. But our waitress did try to attend to us often and made sure our drinks were filled."}
{"text":"Our little family has been coming here for 10 years, love their food - were bummed when the apple pie changed, but still Oh! so good - but finally decided to give a review for more than just their amazing staff, service, quality, and value - THEIR INTEGRITY!! took my daughter for her birthday, didn't realize she had taken her purse with all her birthday money ($200) and left it there,.. 2 weeks later, when she finally gave me clues on where it could be called them, and they returned the money to us... we could not be more grateful, my daughter cried and had a birthday miracle all over again!! THANK YOU, THANK YOU , THANK YOU!!! Again, LOVE YOUR FOOD!!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband had the best brunch in this place!! everything was fresh, on time, and great friendly  service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great breakfast/brunch spot. They have the biggest bear claws I have ever seen and they are always super fresh and delicious. I had the sweet creme waffle with bacon and fruit. The waffle is nice and fluffy. The bacon was cooked perfectly- crispy but not burnt. The freshly squeezed orange juice is FRESH and good. Try it. I love the bear decor everywhere it's really fun and a cool place to be in. Staff is super friendly, they make you feel at home."}
{"text":"Decided to have brunch here. Restaurant was pretty busy so I immediately thought that this place must be good. Waited for a table for about 20 minutes. So far, waiters, cashiers, and the guy that brought us to our table were great! Food was delicious! Very filling and generous portions. 

The second most important thing besides excellent customer service that is important to me when dining out is how fast I get my refill!! lol it may seem tedious.
I shouldn't have to ask for a refill or wait longer than 5-10 minutes to get a refill. 

Otherwise, great place to eat and great for kids!"}
{"text":"The staff are fun, caring and engaging.  They were happy to talk with you, make food suggestions and take care of your needs.  Our server was funny and personable and the hostess was great.  Most importantly the food was GREAT!  Good food that was inexpensive and great service."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to Black Bear Diner for a few years and We love it!!! Their breakfast is Amazing and their lunch and dinner are Delicious! The customer service is spectacular, Candice,Brenda and Sandy know us by name and we are always greeted with a smile. Thank you Ladies you guys are AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were on a road trip from TX to CA. We decided to stop here on the recommendation of his parents. Glad we did. It was so good, we decided to stop on the way back too. On our first trip, I had the fish tacos and he had the patty melt with fries. The fish tacos came with a lot of nicely fried fish inside and plenty of toppings. I liked how they fried the outer corn tortilla so they were easier to pick up and didn't fall apart. The \"Mama Burn\" Chipotle sauce is very spicy. In retrospect I'd ask them to leave that off, but I powered through and it was good. The patty melt was also excellent. Very greasy and satisfying. On our second trip I had a chicken sandwich which was good and my BF had a burger. The best part are the kettle chips. Super good. Both times the place was packed, but the line moves fast and the staff is friendly. I highly recommend trying them if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Love this little diner! Great service and delicious food. Have never gotten something there that didn't taste amazing. We make a point of going every time that we go to Vegas. A must stop, trust me the biscuits are worth the stop!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome here.. once you get it. It seems that every time we have come here it takes over 30-45 mins to get our breakfast and it's a little cold. That's the only reason I didn't get it a 5 star. Other than that- extensive menu and friendly employees."}
{"text":"A good family restaurant. The food is fairly good. Breakfast is probably the best. The staff are friendly but service is not fast. This is a slow paced restaurant. I definitely recommend eating here when you have more than one hour. Oh, and the pies are yummy!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go for breakfast. Deli is and large portions so come with an empty belly. When I come I usually have to get a side of pancakes because they're they good. If you're trying to eat healthy or on a diet they have a low calorie menu too."}
{"text":"We've  sitting here for the pass
20 minutes and no one has come to ask for drinks. When they did take our order for drinks it took them long to bring them. We sat there for a while. It's upsetting because the food here is good but the service really sucked!
I came from Los Angeles for Thanksgiving weekend and had a really bad experience :(("}
{"text":"Had the best breakfast here today! Waitstaff and mangers are always so friendly and down to earth. Note: You get huge portions but I'm always happy to take half of them home! Very decent prices. Today as we were waiting to pay we caved in and bought a couple pies to bring home (banana cream) so happy we did delish!! Yum."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!! Everything about the place is great. Saw this place on our way to our timeshare in Vegas and thought I love breakfast, let's give it a try.  So glad we did. We sat at the counter and got a great view of how everything runs. Shout out to our waiter Sandor. Hard working always moving and constantly checking on us. Great customer service.
Now let's talk about the food.  The biscuits are amazing. (See pictures) bacon delicious.  My husband said the hot sauces were really good as well.
The team work that this staff displays rocks. We watched as everyone helped each other get food to tables. Everyone on shift this morning was moving with a purpose.
Cleanliness is a plus. Watched servers wipe things down, constantly cleaning.  Even the public restrooms were clean. (That's a super plus for me)
This is definitely a place I will come back to. If I could give more stars I would. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places I've ever been to. Super yummy, super friendly servers and overall atmosphere was too cute with all the teddy bears on the wall."}
{"text":"Been to three in the Phoenix area, this is by far the worst of the three. Food came out cold prime rib never even seen the grill before my plate. Straight from.           
fridge to plate. The response I get from the server well were almost out of that so I can have them heat it up, would have been nice heated in the first place"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat the food is always good and service is great. Frequent place for me to eat when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The food here was shockingly amazing! I ordered the wild Alaskan Salmon with spinach & it was surprisingly a great complimentary dish.  I would have never paired the two. My husband ordered the Chicken Parmesan, which he absolutely loved. Lastly we shared the cinnamon roll French toast...OMG, so gooood. Cannot forget to mention the corn bread. Check this place out."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a Friday for a late breakfast - around 10AM. The parking lot was packed and there were groups of people just waiting around (inside and outside). Luckily, the wait time was relatively short so we decided to wait it out and good thing that we did. I ordered the ScramBowl and my husband ordered an omelet and pancakes. Portions were huge and everything was delicious. I must add that I am not a pancake person, but the pancakes here are amazing!!! They are a must if you decide to stop in here and you should! Service was also exceptional! Sam (our waitress) was extremely chipper and was always present to provide whatever we needed. Thank you, Sam!"}
{"text":"Real good food ! Got the country fried steak entree usual thing i get. Never disappoints 
New spot so understand why they have poor service but hasnt changed ina while. Maybe some new servers with good attitudes would help."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast joint 
Flavorful food 
Great staff 
Coffee is on point 
Price is under $10 for most breakfast items 
I love it"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I was visiting the area and had been recommended to this place numerous times and finally went in one morning to try it. The atmosphere was great and the waitresses were so happy. Starting with the coffee, everything was awesome! I ordered the Bear's choice which was two eggs, pancakes and bacon. The food was so fresh and the pancakes were bombay. 

I enjoyed the bear-themed atmosphere throughout the restaurant. From the paper placemat with the history of the restaurant written on it to the bear mugs we were drinking coffee out of, everything was very entertaining.

I will recommend this place for breakfast, lunch or dinner and hope to be back for a nice breakfast soon."}
{"text":"Truly a great place for whatever you're craving.  The menu is simple, well organized and easy to understand. Service was acceptable, even during rush hour... however, some of the waitresses need a refresher course on customer relations. The food is exceptional. Large portions & quality has made this a regular place for us."}
{"text":"I love coming to this diner for the food. However, they're staffing is sometimes un\"bear\"able. Food took forever to arrive, approximately 50 minutes. When it did, it was delicious and the fresh OJ was great. Just wish they had better customer service."}
{"text":"I been wanting to try this place out, but guess I will never get to. I walked in and there were 2 people in front of me paying their bill. When I finally came to the register I said I need a table for 1. Just then an older couple came behind me. The cashier told me that she would check them out before me, then she will help me. Ok cool no problem. Whole groups started coming up paying for their meals! She took all of them before me. Then another lady came to the front and sat two people before me!! Is this how this place normally is? Im glad Ihop sat me right away like a NORMAL PLACE!"}
{"text":"pretty traditional breakfast options~
  I have eaten at a few BB Diners and the staff is ALWAYS so perky & pleasant which is nice at the crack of dawn and the Henderson location was no different.
  My husband has the Corned Beef Hash.........which looked nice however he said it was mezza mezza & the potatoes were under cooked...
I had 2 scrambled eggs with cheese and a the huge biscuit which were both good~
   I did notice that their windows needed a lot of attention and the booth dividers could has used a good cleaning too!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and plenty of it! Onion rings were well done and crispy...and there were actually onions in the rings! The Western bbq hamburger was wonderful with a gardenburger. I also could have had chicken. Good service...accomodating. Don't yet know about the dessert...so full will have to take it home for MUCH later...maybe breakfast!"}
{"text":"My partner in crime = PIC and I decided to come here one morning to fill our bellies to the brim. 

Well, I ordered their sandwich special, which consisted or two cold pieces of bread stuffed with \"Tri tip\" I think it was just roast beef. It was okay, the gigantic mountain of fries were good and made up most of the meal. 

PIC got chicken and waffles, also included a mountain of fries. The chicken was hot and crispy and the waffle was soft and squishy. They we pretty good, the best topper of all was the maple syrup, I swear it's laced with extra buttery goodness. 

We will probably come by another time to give it another chance maybe at another location."}
{"text":"Been a few times. The portions are outrageously huge and the food is super yummy.  Good ole deep down South cookin' for sure!  Takes me back to Mema's kitchen every time.  Definitely the spot for any Born & Raised Southerner who finds themselves traveling out West :)"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing customer service. They have fresh squeezed orange juice thats amazing also!"}
{"text":"Came in for the first time today 06/25/2017 for Dads birthday. And OMG is the food AMAZING! We were greeted as soon as we walked in and seated within 2 mins. Everyone was very friendly. Plates are huge! Prices are well worth the amount of food they give you. I got a cornbread and this is the best corn bread i have ever had! 
We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"One of their new location opening up at the south Las Vegas Outlet. Attended dinner last night for the soft opening. Grand opening is set for Monday. Since it was used as a training purpose, you can feel the staff gave extra attentiveness. Our waiter was on point throughout dinner. 

For dinner I went with the meatloaf, with mash potato and veggies as the sides. It also includes soup or salad and cornbread. The food was pretty good, meatloaf was moist, mash potato is creamy and the veggies cooked to my liking, not soggy. Also the portions are on the larger side. 

Will come back to try the breakfast and lunch menu."}
{"text":"First time here and OMG I wish we knew about this place sooner. It's right by our house and it is amazing! I had the huevos rancheros bendict and it was so flavorful and mouthwatering. I didn't have room for dessert but the pies looked so delicious,, I will have to go back for that as well. Definitely going to be our new breakfast spot."}
{"text":"OH MY GOSH DID WE LOVE IT! We live right down the road and this was such a bad decision for us to make because now we are going to become poor because we will be here everyday! I got the Bears Choice with pancakes and bacon and it was delicious and Steven got the Country fried steak which was delicious! Don't forget to get there orange juice it's amazing! We can't wait to go back! Excellent service as well!"}
{"text":"I received a free birth day breakfast, we have never visited so now had a great reason. I have to say service is great, friendly and warm.  our server welcomed us and mentioned pumpkin pancakes were on special today. my coupon was for eggs with waffle or sweet cream pancakes with bacon or sausage. I showed my coupon to our server and she said oh yes, that's the 'beards choice'. she asked if I wanted bacon, sausage or ham...I chose ham, then asked if I could substitute the special panckes for the sweet cream ones. she said sure, no problem. hubby got the chicken fried steak and asked about the gravy. she offered to let him taste it and returned with a soup cup full! he ordered a biscuit and she asked if he wanted gravy, he said yes as he was planning on having it with his gravy covered breakfast. I have to say my piece of ham was tiny, but for free I would not complain. I've had better pumpkin pancakes, but they were fine. then came the bill. there was a 99 cent charge for biscuit and gravy. I inquired, the biscuit isn't included? she said yes, but not the gravy.....after having gravy covered chicken fried steak and bringing a bowl to taste....really??? after my coupon the bill still seemed too high. I inquired and was told my coupon covers 8.99, yet my free breakfast was 10.99. nowhere on the coupon is there a limit, but more importantly why did I get charged 2.00 more for that breakfast? I don't appreciate the underhanded scamming. don't tell the customer they can substitute and not tell them there is an up charge. I guess this is standard practice and people don't complain. don't be ridiculous and charge for gravy when my meal already includes it. for these. check your bills people....."}
{"text":"When you first walk in, this place reminds you of one of those creepy grandmas who hoards stuffed bears and anything reminiscent of them. Stuffed bears line the top shelves and pictures of bears cover the walls. But ambiance aside, the food was bomb.

I ordered some kind of scramble with avocado, cheese, green bell peppers and tomatoes. It was so delicious for being just that. The cook even gave me hash browns by mistake when I just ordered fruit with it. The has browns were delicious and unique. They were like short fettucini noodles but golden brown crispness. Mmm. I wish all places made them like that. My dish came with a huge buttermilk biscuit too which was flaky and soft. 

Everyone else at my table loved their food too. Prices were great for what we got."}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience this morning at the Gilbert restaurant.  The Veggie Omelet was swimming in oil - had to use the toast to soak it up.  The veggies was so overdone that it was impossible to eat most of them.  The egg whites were ok, once I drained the oil off them.  The fruit consisted of melons plus ONE sliced strawberries.    The service was bad, we had to wait once we were seated for 10 minutes to place our order, had to wait for coffee, wait for refills, wait 30+ minutes to pay our check because the line was so long it was beyond ridiculous.   We have always enjoyed Black Bear Diners up and down the west coast - today, it was a resounding no from us."}
{"text":"Good food great great portions .... Quality is amazing .   Service is wonderful and always a pleasure visiting this location when we are in town."}
{"text":"I love the feel of this diner,  it feels like I'm out of town.  The servers are friendly,  food is good and not overpriced.  Average meal $12. Great place with great personality."}
{"text":"I took a friend, from out of town, for brunch at Black Bear on NYE. There was a little bit of a wait for a table for 2 (20 min) but that's expected on a holiday weekend. When the waitress took our order and let us know that the kitchen was a bit backed up. I appreciated her communicating that to us. I didn't mind the wait because she had already given us a heads up. I ordered the Volcano and when it arrived, it looked just like the photos! It was absolutely fantastic. By far the best breakfast I've had in a long time. I also had a glass of their freshly squeezed orange juice and it too was very tasty!! I love this place and will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I make it a point to have breakfast/brunch here at least once every time I am out in Vegas.  (Man, it's going to be way easier when I finally move here).  I can sit here and rave about everything on their menu, their service, attentiveness, etc.  But it would take forever.

Food is amazing, service is great.  Decor is definitely a trip, with Big wooden bears watching over you.  They manage to through in a bit of nostalgia as well - the placemats are copies of actual 1950s Vegas news articles.  Don't let the parking lot fool you - i've never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a table.  

Eggs are cooked perfectly.  Chicken fried steak (one of my favorites when I am there) is dead-on.  Burgers are perfect, and HUGE.  I can't say enough.

And for those visiting, and looking for an alternative to the breakfast buffets, and all that crap.  Get in your car, and get over there.  Now."}
{"text":"I'm been a Black Bear fan for a long time. But having breakfast today at this particular Black Bear was pretty bad. We waited awhile to be seated which was expected but it took awhile before our server got to us. The hostess after 10 minutes came by and asked us what we would like to drink. The server was pretty busy. That only because he was putting out fires because the cooks sucked big time. We all ordered eggs over medium and we set them back 3 times The fourth time they got it right. Even though the manager made it right. I blame them the most. They was involved from the second round and your telling me that they couldn't see that they have a problem come on. I will go to other Black Bears again just not this one."}
{"text":"Came here hung over, the biscuits and gravy saved my life. My wife had the chicken fried steak and I can see why its famous. Great food, great prices, friendly staff... only problem is the teddy bears everywhere kinda creeped me out. But definitely five stars!"}
{"text":"false advertising and uninformed manangment. second time we have had a problem here and mgmt just doesnt care. came in to use coupon we received from BEAR REWARDS CLUB. They did not want to honor what is printed on coupon, plus they were out of 1 of 3 entrees u must purchase to get coupon promo.  No substitutions so if they are out too bad. S.O.L. wish i could give negative stars....."}
{"text":"First time here.  Bear themed all the way-- little bear cubs climbing poles,  curtains with bears on them, even the hot sauces on the table are named mama bear, papa bear and baby bear.

Ordered the fish and chips and was able to get a baked potato instead of french fries. It came with a side of cole slaw. 
My companion had the pecan crusted trout with baked potato and fresh vegetables.  
I liked the fish and chips ( 3 pieces of fish) minus the cole slaw.  The slaw was just too sweet for my palate.  The trout was nicely coated with a pecan crust and was a decent portion.  The baked potatoes on both dishes were large .    
To anyone who visits here,  know that this is not fine dining.  It is diner food and for the money, it is a good value.  
The service provided by Adam was on point and quite attentive. 

Note to management:  You all wear black uniforms.  Black uniforms can be as unforgiving as white uniforms in that they both highlight lack of cleanliness.  The uniforms looked very dirty even the one the \"manager\" at the cash register was wearing.  Before we entered, we saw two kitchen workers taking a smoking break and the uniforms left a lot to be desired.  I didn't think the servers would suffer from the same problem."}
{"text":"Go hungry! This place is about huge breakfast portions. As far as quality, it's hit or miss. So, you might want to give it a few tries"}
{"text":"Similar to other Black Bear Diners, this one also features numerous wooden bear and other rustic designs. In addition to the art and an assortment of hats and shirts, they have one of the best breakfast menus you will ever see! I have eaten tons of the things on the menu and have yet to be disappointed! So if you are looking for a big, hearty, non-healthy, delicious breakfast stop by the Diner today! Also gets pretty busy on Sunday mornings!"}
{"text":"We waited for 20 minutes for a table which is fine I understand it's busy at lunch time. However after realizing everyone around who came in after me was seated I went up to the hostess to ask how much longer a table would be. She said \"oh oops I wrote your name down wrong so I called the wrong name\". Another girl decided to seat me. After waiting another 12 minutes not one single person came up to our table to let me know someone would be with us or take our order. All in all we waited over 35 minutes for NOTHING! I decided to leave and head next door to Chili's where they actually knowledge their customers. YOUR LOSS YOUR COMPETITORS GAIN."}
{"text":"The food here is great. Today, we both tried the Bay Shrimp Salad BLT sandwich. It was a tasty combination of shrimp salad with bacon, lettuce and tomato on thick cut sourdough bread."}
{"text":"My food was awesome I had the Gobbler sandwich hands down awesome. And I had the banana cream pie was hmmm mmmm goodd"}
{"text":"One of the best place go to for breakfast! I highly recommend this restaraunt. Fast service and great food!"}
{"text":"Filling, like your momma made it, American food. Yum! Helpful and friendly staff. I prefer to call ahead to grab a take-out dinner to take home with me on those nights when my husband and I don't have the time/energy to cook."}
{"text":"The wait wasn't too bad for a Sunday morning.  But we were taken to a dining room that was just \"too open\".  We got no feelings of privacy or anything, being sat in the dead center of a very noisy dining room.  The bathrooms are so cramped and crowded, which is uncomfortable.  The menu.. well, let's just say, that sometimes less is more, and BBD has way too many options on theirs.  It's confusing to order and when you do, it's obvious that the cooks make the \"easy\" meals first because my food came out ice cold.  The food is nothing to write home about, in my opinion.  I really wanted to find a new Sunday breakfast spot, but BBD just didn't deliver."}
{"text":"Always love coming here for breakfast and lunch.  Service is quick and friendly and the proportions are crazy huge!"}
{"text":"Can't say how much I love this restaurant. Every time we are in town, we make it a point to stop here. Don the manager is friendly very humble and down to earth. He will come to our table and talk to us just like we are family, even though we are from Texas and visit maybe 3 times a year.  The service here alone will keep us coming back. Now on to the food. We have never had a issue it always hot and fresh the portions are huge but not to ridiculous that you can feed a small village but definetly enough for two. We've had both breakfast and lunch we were impressed with both the tri-tip was really good. If you want a little of normal away from the strip definetly visit this location tell Don hi and he will make sure your taken care of."}
{"text":"Best service ever. Had to pull the manager aside and just thank him for trading such a great staff. 


Food was good. Selection and prices were awesome."}
{"text":"Great service - great food old style dinner minus the counter- have yet to find a bad meal from black bear"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place for any time of the day, breakfast is great . The home made, we'll everything but especially sausage and corned beef hash, awesome taco salad and great sandwiches"}
{"text":"As visitor to Las Vegas it was my first time visiting the city and also the diner witch was very good if I must add and I'm not talking about just the food either. The actual place is like it has that home away  feel and the service is very 5 star the waitress we had I guess she was new be to the diner but very polite and good looking I think her name was Italia or something like that so thank you again to both of you the diner for having great food which I will be returning for real soon and are waitress Italia for her A+++ service."}
{"text":"I have only been to Black Bear Diner for the breakfast and the food is fantastic! Lots of great tasting food for a low price!"}
{"text":"Huge portions, reasonable prices, great service, and good food. I've only been here for breakfast, but everything has consistently been above average or excellent. The pancakes are some of the best pancakes I've ever had. The ham is a thick ham-steak that's grilled, and one of my favorite things on the menu. The biscuits are huge and fresh and the gravy is plentiful. The strip hash browns are my favorite breakfast potatoes of recent memory. Had a taste of hubby's chicken fried steak and it was AMAZING....I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.

I always make it a point to visit Black Bear Diner when visiting Arizona or Nevada. I sure wish they would come to Southern California!!!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy Excellent Food and Great, Friendly service...... you have arrived. I'm not a Morning person, but I have eaten their Breakfast meals numerous times. Pancakes ,French Toast, Eggs, Bacon and Sausage Patties = mmmmmm Good. Also their Hambugers get a 5 star rating from me. There also about 500 or so Teddy Bears on the shelves. No I am Not kidding !

I would also recommend their Fresh Baked Pies. It is packed most of the time, but it is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place has excellent food at reasonable prices. Sometimes the servers can be a little flakey but today we had Andres and he was awesome! He was fast and efficient and not too annoying. He never asked how we were with a mouth full of food. I would have given them 5 stars but the stuffed bears on the shelves creep me out because I can only imagine how dusty they get."}
{"text":"I love the Black Bear, its one of my favorite places to eat.  The prices are reasonable, its comfortable, and they feed you like a bear.  My favorite menu item is the cornbread muffins.  They are the best! Sweet, but not too sweet, with plenty of butter--amazing! They go with anything.  I get extra.  Breakfast is good here too.  And they serve up awesome pot roast, just be sure to ask for extra gravy or they don't give you enough.  I think almost anybody could find something here to enjoy.  Its great for groups for that reason.  There's always somebody in the group who's gotta be picky, bring'em here."}
{"text":"I love the Black Bear, its my go to for good old fashioned comfort food.  The cornbread muffins alone are reason to stop in.  I like the pot roast, the chicken pot pie and the tri tip best, but most of the things I've tried have been edible to very good.  If you're feeling like breakfast, they do that too.  The atmosphere is friendly and casual, service is usually pretty good.  As with any chain, some locations do better than others.  I haven't been to a Black Bear that was outright bad, but there have been disappointments.  Overall, you're not going to have any troubled finding something for everyone to enjoy on the menu.  It's a good place to take the whole family for a meal.  If you haven't been, you should go.  I just wish they were open later!"}
{"text":"This place is so adorable and rustic.   It's 4 miles off the Strip.   Outside there were a few wooden bears, a fun photo op if my son was willing.   This place reminds me of the cute diners in smaller towns, not what I expect from worldly Vegas.  
Upon entering, we were warmly greeted by the host and immediately seated.  
The waittress was attentive and we were served our coffee and milk right away.  
She suggested the chicken fried steak which is a fave here.  Hubby decided to be adventurous and ordered it. 
Portuguese sausage was on the menu as well, which is unusual for a non Hawaiian restaurant to offer.   Maybe next time, but this time, I ordered my usual diner breakfast... Eggs benedict with Hollandaise sauce on the side.  Plus, the fruit on the side was plentiful which was an absolute delight.  I actually took that to go as a snack for later on.  
I also got the diced potatoes while hubby tried the the hashbrowns. He also got the fluffiest Buttermilk biscuit to sop up the gravy.  He raved that everything was homemade.  Note: You have to eat the biscuit before it gets cold.
Son got the Strawberry Waffle off the kids menu.  It was big enough for adults and had lots of fresh strawberries, not the gooey artificial kind. 
I loved the diced potatoes as they were tasty,  nothing here was too salty.  
There were stuffed bears all lined up high on the wall to complement the Bear theme.  Also, the menus were cute in that they were newspapers with the menu items listed on the inside. 
Our food arrived timely and since we got there around 8:30 am on a Saturday, we got a table.  Around 9ish, a line started to form. 
The clientele appears to be mainly locals, families, seniors, etc. 
We were so satisfied that hubby and I didnt even eat lunch that day. 
We recommended Black Bear to our cousin and her hubby, locals who had never heard of Black Bear, and they came in on Sunday.  They loved it too.  Now, we have a great alternative to the hotel buffets.  Expect to pay about $10 per person."}
{"text":"I have a thing for diners. I cannot explain it. I love them... if they are up to snuff. None of that Denny's and IHOP overpriced under delivered stuff. 

The thing about black bear dinner is that... the prices are good and the portions are great. The staff is friendly and that alone makes me want to go back. In fact, I went two days in a row. And that was two days in a row that I was stuffed full and happy. 

Prepare for a line if you are aiming for weekend brunch. It is worth the wait."}
{"text":"I have to say that I was super pleased with this place.  First off, we had a party of 10 that decided the night before that we were going to go here for breakfast.  Some of the people in the Club had eaten at the one in Scottsdale and raved about the food portions, the price and the service.  We called the night before and spoke with the manager (sorry I can't remember their name).  When we arrived at 8 am, the tables were set up and everything was ready.  Our server was great and constantly on top of things and even took a picture for us.

Now on to the food.  If biscuits the size of softballs are your thing or portions that a Black Bear would have trouble downing in one sitting are your forte, then this place is for you.  Personally I had the chicken fried steak (the small one) and it was delicious, probably the best I have ever had.  My wife had the sausage plate with the spicy sausage.  It too was delicious.  More often than not when you hear the word \"spicy\" it tends to be on the tame side....not the case.  The sausage was perfectly seasoned.  A few of our friends had the corned beef hash and raved about it.  It is actually shredded corned beef, not the stuff you get out of a can that looks like dog food (although I do find that ok in a pinch).  I also tried their hot sauces and they were all very tasty.

There was only one complaint that I heard from 2 of the people that we were with and that was that their biscuit seemed a little doughy in the middle and tasted like flour,  I'm guessing a problem that may pop up from time to time with biscuits the size of softballs.  They didn't complain because there was plenty of other food.

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yummmm 

portions are amazing and it's super good. Me and my boyfriend go here at least a couple times a month! It's definitely our go to breakfast joint! Prices are great and service  is always a 10!!!"}
{"text":"Been here for breakfast twice, lunch once, and dinner once.

Breakfast both times was pretty good. HUGE portions. Busy place. I guess the sausages are homemade? Can't remember having anything for breakfast that I didn't like. Both guests I went with on both occasions were happy too. Service is mostly on top of things and friendly. 

For lunch I had \"the gobbler\" with fries... a turkey sandwich with cranberry, avacado, tomato, and onion. Fries were pretty darn impressive. Enjoyed this sandwich. The time I went for dinner I remember thinking it was just average. Still massive portions though.

Only downside I have found to the place was today when we ordered a \"blackbeary\" cobbler to go. Thinking that this was black bear diner, the blackberry cobbler should be a specialty.... it was pretty lackluster. Mostly just goo with a few berries, topped with a pie-crust like topping that wasn't quite cooked all the way. We popped it in the microwave and tried to help it out with some vanilla ice cream, but it just wasn't good. Not AWFUL, but not good. So we won't get that again. Otherwise a decent place!"}
{"text":"All day breakfast menu... reminds me a rustic version of IHOP or Denny's.. decor went well with the theme... 

Tried the sweet cream waffles with traditional breakfast. I'm not sure I was a huge fan of the waffles. Too cakey and was a bit too thick, but still good in little bits. 

Overall good. Wouldn't mind going back to try other things."}
{"text":"Visiting in town where some of my family lives. They recommended this diner. We get there around lunch time.  We were quickly greeted and seated. It wasn't crowded, and the restaurant was clean.  Our server was pleasant and concise. My pops ordered the corned beef hash, potatoes and a bun. I ventured into the lunch menu and discovered a burger that resembled one of my favorites; a patty melt.  We ordered and waited about the right about amount of time. 

When we got our food, the serving size was generous.  The burger I ordered cheeseburger with sautéed onions. It was pretty good, a bit too much mustard for my taste, but overall a good choice. The bread was sourdough with a light sprinkle cheese toasted on it. I can't comment on how my dads corned beef was, but I can say it was a huge portion, enough for two regular appetites. 

Overall it was a good experience and I did enjoy my burger.  I think they did enough that we will come back the next time I visit."}
{"text":"There's no way you can be hungry after a meal here. The portions are really big. Their fresh made Bear claws are delicious. The Eggs Benedict came with an egg without it's yolk. The ham is a bit salty. The whole grain pancakes are surprisingly good. We ordered two entrees for three people and still had leftovers. That's how much food you get. 

Whenever I visit Phoenix, I like coming here. Good food, good prices and friendly staff. What else would anyone ask for?"}
{"text":"The menu is a bit expansive, but there isn't a single thing on it you aren't going to be impressed with."}
{"text":"Great place...with huge portions. Love all the bear stuff. Had brunch with my mom and daughter."}
{"text":"Our waitress was great.  However she was unfortunately challenged with a kitchen that could not make food fast enough.  It took 50 minutes to get a sandwich entree and a breakfast plate.  The food was also not warm and definitely didn't taste fresh.  The good news, the place is spotless, clean, and feels downright homey. Hopefully this was an anomaly and if for any reason I find myself here again I hope for a better experience."}
{"text":"Jeez I'm actually sitting here right now wasn't spoken too by our server April for about 15 minutes im being generous with the time, because she was too busy flirting with the gentleman sitting alone.. Really wish I knew that before I decided to sit down. I actually was timing her on to see how long it would take her to acknowledge me. She finally decides to greet us and I ask about one of the items. And says well it's a \"country fried steak\". That wasn't my question, and when she left my table she still went to talk to him, lol she has been standing there this whole time while I'm writing this. She needs to learn how to serve new guests and have alittle less attitude. Update he just left maybe we will get service now."}
{"text":"I went here on a date and was AMAZED by the poriton sizes here. I got a Tuna Salad and there had to been a quarter LB of Tuna on this thing. I wish they had more of a selection and actually had Arnold Palmer mix. The prices were very reasonable and the atmosphere was cozy. I am planning on visiting again after good work out so, I am better prepared for these positions haha!"}
{"text":"This place really deserves 2 stars but I added one for the sweet cream pancakes which were awesome. The husband and I ordered chicken fried steak and why not we're in Sin City why not partake in some gluttony. The steak was good but I've had better. The potatoes were just awful! We had hash browns and breakfast potatoes both were barely room temperature and raw in the middle. The waiter was super busy and it had already taken a while just to get our food so we just dealt. We actually got our pancakes after we had finished our eggs and steak. Lucky too as that was the only saving grace, the pancakes kind of tasted like cake but in a good way. If you decided to go stick with maybe pancakes and eggs no potatoes. Also the iced tea was weird it just tasted funky bad batch maybe?"}
{"text":"Ordered their ribs and tri tip for dinner and it was so disgusting. Stay away from it! Tasted like they hurried and defrost it and slapped some bbq sauce on it. Also got their country fried steak, which was 10 times better. I would just stick to breakfast here."}
{"text":"I had been dying to try this place for months (specifically breakfast) BUT stopped by for lunch. I had no idea this location even existed. It seemed quite busy but we had no wait. Our server greeted us and took our order. After viewing pics on yelp, I was drooling over the taco salad and had to get it. The pictures do not do it justice - it is MASSIVE. They give you bowls of ranch dressing - I literally thought it was soup that came with the lunch or something. The chicken in the salad was good, and the deep fried shell was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great service and yummy food. Chicken fried steak 'little less' was plenty. The Asian Chicken Salad was great size. Dessert variety is traditional with a coconut cream pie that was HUGE and in a bowl."}
{"text":"This place seems like a diner you would find off some interstate exit in the middle of nowhere, after driving all day...I don't know if it's all the wooden bear sculptures and the rustic country store feel, it seems out of place near the corner of Green Valley and Sunset (didn't this use to be a Chili's?).

Black Bear Diner is pretty excellent comfort food-wise...I was pleasantly surprised. Good food, friendly staff and quick service...our server Tahra was awesome (ask to be seated in her section, she was on top of everything).
Damn good Chicken and Waffles (almost better than Hash House-a-Go Go) and my wife loved the Meatloaf she ordered...we also got the blackberry cobbler to-go, it's a huge serving. Looks like a not-so-mini pie. You must get it!

So, Breakfast served all day...I like breakfast for dinner, will be back."}
{"text":"Our first time here and it won't be our last. Absolutely fabulous breakfast. Alexander was our waiter and he was awesome. Excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Only my second time here. First time was many years ago with friends. This time was for a free birthday breakfast I received through their email club.

We got there around 11am on a Saturday. Had about a 10 minute wait. The hostess was pleasant. Our server came to our table almost right away.

We ordered the Bear Breakfast with sausage, two eggs and a waffle along with a side of bacon and toast. The coffee was good, and the food came out hot in a reasonable amount of time. The bacon was cooked just right and a nice thickness. The sausage was seasoned well. The waffle was okay but a bit sweet for my tastes. It had a sweet cream flavor. Overall, food was delicious. 

The service was excellent. Christine was our server. She did a fantastic job! Came by our table at all the right times even though she was fairly busy. 

Looks like they have a great lunch and dinner menu as well. Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"Fantastic from start to finish!  Our server Laura was friendly, and extremely knowledgeable of ALL menu items!  Big portion sizes for the price!  I ordered the California omelet with red potatoes and a huge biscuit!   Also very accommodating for adjusting the menu item with extra items added to your entree.  
We stopped in for a late dinner Wednesday nite and thought they closed at 10:00!  They actually close at 11:00. We arrived at 9:30 so we were glad we had that extra hour.  Turns out, we were not rushed!  Food was amazing!  I want to go back for another visit!  Another female seated us and she was just as awesome as Laura!   She was taking care of all the jobs of cleaning, seating guests, delivering items!  The reviews just can't do justice for this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop for an early breakfast on the way to the airport. We had eaten at another Black Bear Diner for dinner, but never breakfast. It was very quiet on this morning with only 4 tables being served. Our waiter was fantastic - he took our drink order and returned with them quickly. He then took our meal order and we waited in anticipation. In the meantime, we watched our waiter scurry around the restaurant taking care of everyones needs - super friendly & very effecient ! Then came our meals - french toast & eggs, bacon, hash browns - all looking & smelling fantastic - and plenty of food ! All of it tasted great ! In fact, I would venture to say this is one of the best breakfast meals I've ever had !! Great food & great service - High praise & definitely deserved . . . Well done - Black Bear - Well done !!"}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for down home cooking this is the place, I have ate hear about 10 times, every meal is so large you have to take half home for lunch the next day, very busy on Sunday mornings, their burgers are yummy, sandwiches yummy, soup yummy !! if youre up by west Tropicana stop by . and check out the cute bear stuff, oh I almost forget: The shakes are yummy !!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by this location after having tried a previous Black Bear Diner in Tulare, CA while traveling.

The food here is good.  While reading the about the history of the Black Bear Diner on the menu, it mentioned the original establishment was set up to offer generous portions of home-style, comfort food at affordable prices.  The restaurant does it well.  The food isn't world class, or the best I ever ate but so far I've enjoyed all the dishes I've had while eating at this particular chain.  They give you large portions and the dishes are relatively inexpensive.  This is a good place to go if you're looking to have a good full meal without breaking the bank.  I came with a group, and everybody was satisfied after dining here.

The menu seems to be consistent between all of the Black Bear Diners I've been too.  I didn't notice any local food or deals.  Even though we came for lunch at about 2pm, the waiter informed us that they were still serving breakfast!  We also asked if they served the dinner portions of the menu at this time, and she said yes.  However, she stated that some of the sides wouldn't be available at this time such as the baked potatoes until after 4pm.  I suppose depending on the time you visit here, it may limit the menu selection you have to choose from.

I tried the Mickey's Chicken Pot Pie.  This dish comes with your choice of a side dish.  I had the Vegetable of the Day which was sauteed vegetables.  It was a mixture of a carrots, yellow squash and zucchini.  Unlike the dinner specials on the menu, this dish doesn't come with soup or salad.  The Pot Pie comes in a medium sized ramekin bowl.  The filling is spooned into the bowl, there is no bottom layer of crust to the \"pie\" just the top layer.  The top came out browned and flaky.  The filling itself was quite good.  It had large chunks of chicken.  There was a large amount of peas in this pot pie.  I happen to like peas, so this doesn't bother me.  However, I'm not sure if it was normal for there to be this many peas in the pot pie, or if I just happened to get a scooping with a lot of peas.  So for those who aren't that big of a fan of peas take note!

In addition, many of the dish come with corn bread muffins.  My part and I ordered extra corn bread as a side to go with our meal.  There's nothing special about the corn bread.  It tasted great and they were served to us piping hot out of the oven.  I happen to think they tasted better after they cooled down a little bit and had a chance to solidify.  They also don't seem to crumble and fall apart as much as the  freshly baked hot ones.

Overall, I definitely like this chain and would visit them again."}
{"text":"Not a vegas experience. But a good breakfast option. About 10 minutes from the Strip. Came here for brunch. It was busy but the wait was short ~5 minutes. Staff were friendly and cool. The portions were HUGE! The taste was good. 

Pros: good price, big portions, easy parking, nice staff. 

Cons: oversized portions. Not healthy."}
{"text":"Not sure why alot of people complain about the service, for us it was awesome. I gave my server a great tip because he was so attentive and friendly. We started with a bear claw, which was not delicious. I almost would rather have the packaged one from the gas station. However it was gigantic. I don't think ours was fresh as it was not warm, but it was huge. We also shared the country fried steak which was also massive. It was cooked well and perfectly crispy. I am really just surprised at how big the portion was, granted we got the bigger portion to share. But it was a very good bang for our buck!"}
{"text":"I went to the green valley location and was not completely satisfied - but my bear obsession and Saturday morning search for a breakfast location brought me here. I ordered a veggie omelet and it had a good amount of vegetables in it. The potatoes stole the show - I could have ate an entire plate of them! My toast was a little burnt but definitely edible. Our server was very chipper and friendly. This staff seemed much more friendly that than the GV location - they were even blowing up balloons and passing them out to the kids in the restaurant. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were excited to be comped two meals as a part of their opening celebration. Even tho the meals were postponed by Black Bear (an air conditioning issue), we were happy to wait for a more opportune time. After all: we had eaten many times at the Tropicana location and were happy with the food and service. 

With ticket in hand, we headed there on Wed night, 08/24/16) and were seated right off. The place was lightly populated and we discounted this as it was still early evening.

We were seated and given a couple of glasses of tea where they must have just made a batch; there was ice in it, but it was melting fast. I asked for extra ice.  The waitress was friendly enough but I was convinced her mind was elsewhere. It took quite a while and I had to ask a second time before I got the ice. The food was another story.

The waitress took our order and we were not served until 25-30 minutes later. We chalked this up to my having ordered the fried chicken. My wife ended up with the lunch-portion of meatloaf: one paltry slice. I got three pieces of WAY overcooked chicken and had to send it back. It was black-burned in a few spots and had more tanning done than George Hamilton.  It had to have been dropped into a way-too-hot grease pan as the skin was literally burned off in several spots.  Interestingly, it took a VERY short time for a new dish to arrive with about half the overcooking as the first batch. (I suspect some poor soul who was about to be served was going to get his meal later than expected.) I held my temper and dug in. The chicken that I did eat was not bad but was a bit dry. Seasoning was good and the breading light and crisp.  The baked potato was just right.

The waitress came by and asked if I wanted a to-go box for the rest of my chicken. I politely passed. She asked another question then popped the same question again! (Did I want a to-go box?) All in the span of 40 seconds.  WHAT THE ....??!!??  Yes her mind was definitely not in the game.

We took our check to the counter along with the comp ticket and was asked by the nice cashier, \"Did you enjoy your meal?\"  I told her we were bitterly disappointed. She offered to comp our meal until she realized it was free anyway. She offered some other opportunity to take home some dessert or other items, or I would I like to speak to the manager.  The gent standing 3 feet away appeared to BE that manager but he stood stone-cold-faced and didn't even twitch.

At this point, all we could do was decline. We called it a bust and left.  We'll give it one more chance--much later and after they have had a chance to get their schtick together,.  Time will tell and I will definitely post another entry when that happens. I rarely EVER give a restaurant a second chance and these folks don't really deserve one. But, I LOVE those blackberry cobblers.  We didn't want to tempt fate by taking one home that night. We'll see."}
{"text":"As good as breakfast gets! We eat here almost every weekend and sometimes for lunch or dinner. All the food is delicious and customer service is always great. 

Here's a great tip - if it's packed for breakfast look for open seats at the bar - it's no wait seating! Plus because all the servers are around that area to get things you always have the best service."}
{"text":"Phenomenal!!! First time there, the food was AMAZING! Took a banana cream pie to go after dinner, wasn't disappointed at all! I will return soon!!"}
{"text":"Food was cold, twice...The manager was kind and removed it from the bill... i will return just not for breakfast..."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!  Our waitress Michelle did an awesome job. Will definitely be going back to eat there hopefully Michelle will be our waitress again."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Large portions.  Clean and comfortable. This location is right off the 10 freeway."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, every visit. I usually get the Denver omelette and my son loves the chicken fried steak meal. Homemade biscuits are so tasty. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this greasy spoon! The fresh-squeezed OJ and assorted gut-bomb fare are the perfect hangover helper. Just keep in mind that this is more of a homestyle kind of joint you stumble into with bedhead, not some flashy Vegas dining destination. 

You can't go wrong choosing whatever menu items seem most unhealthy and abominating to you. Like the chicken fried steak or the eggs benedict with bacon and avocado...not that I've ordered and nearly finished either of those after a fun night on the Strip..."}
{"text":"YUM! That is the best way to describe the HUGE almond granola pancakes I had for breakfast (I ordered mine with no powdered sugar or butter and barely used any syrup - the standalone flavor was excellent) I couldn't finish more than 1 pancake (and they were just as good later and a snack, room temperature!)

My husband had the Volcano breakfast with the sweet cream pancakes. I was less impressed with that version of the pancakes, tasted more like a plain muffin to me, but he enjoyed them just fine.

It was SUPER busy, even on a Thursday late morning, so it seems others enjoy the rest of the menu too. There was a good mix of locals and travelers in house, which is a positive in my opinion."}
{"text":"Visiting from Ohio. Delicious vegetarian omelet for me, Shasta scrambler for my hot wife. All home cooked. Coffee good. Service right on the money. Personalable staff."}
{"text":"This place does exactly what it sets out to do which is to provide comfort food at a great price. Portions are huge. I had the beef stew served with a thick slick of buttery toast and it was outstanding. A big heap of mash potatoes in the middle of it. My son had the Tri Trip, which he gobbled up. The food arrived maybe 4 minutes after our order was placed. Very, very fast. This is great value if you like comfort food and a lot of it. Tried the desserts also and they were outstanding. We had a berry cobbler and a chocolate lava cake. Staff was friendly and efficient.

Excellent. Fast service. Huge portions. Comfort food."}
{"text":"I love this place! My friend went for breakfast and liked it so my husband and I decided to go give it a try. We went on a Sunday morning around 10:30 and it was packed! So expect to wait on busy weekend mornings. But the wait was well worth it. I ordered the sweet cream waffle with bacon and eggs and it was very good. My husband ate all of his food so fast I didn't get a chance to even try it but he enjoyed it. We came with a friend who is a very difficult customer. He customizes EVERYTHING to his liking and I could not believe the patience our server Janna had. She was friendly, attentive and nothing but patient with our friend. Excellent food and excellent service!"}
{"text":"Service was great and the food was amazing. I got the spinach and mushroom Benedict with hash browns and it was to die for. Boyfriend got corned beef hash and also enjoyed. Everything was clean and everyone was nice. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"A buddy of mine chose this place to eat after a round of golf.  The food was fantastic!  The orange juice was fresh squeezed and the portion sizes were tremendous.  I would highly recommend this diner to anyone with a big appetite.  The only downside was it was a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for.  The pancakes were some of the best pancakes I have ever had."}
{"text":"Service was really good, food was really good also! We got the country fried steak and eggs beni and a kids new york steak. They were all good. We be back!"}
{"text":"I had heard that this place has very good breakfast with quality ingredients and low prices. However, my husband is not a breakfast person so if you go at dinner time breakfast is still available which is something I need to remember. 

We went on a Friday after a long stressful week where we had our wedding coming up a week later  and it provided comfort food for us, typically not what we would normally have but it hit the spot. I had the fried chicken and waffles so a little dinner and breakfast in one and my husband had the smaller chicken fried steak. The portions were large. 

The service was very good and the food came out hot and quick. 

The decor is very cute. It looks like you are in a cozy cabin. 

I will def be going back for my comfort food fix!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Sandor suggested Steak, eggs, and fries plate. It was awesome. Way more than I can eat. Sandor is a very nice guy. He was attentive and friendly. Now there was a waitress that was stomping around complaining about being hot   She also at one time was complaining about one of her tables saying \"finally they are leaving\". She alone cost Black Bear one star on the rating. Keep up the good work Sandor!"}
{"text":"Dinner menu extensive and not expensive.  Huge portions and plenty of leftovers.  Good food.  

Breakfast even better.  Service for each meal was very good."}
{"text":"Honestly, I have never heard of Black Bear Diner before I came here. I thought it was a Vegas/ Nevada thing. Turns out, theres 40+ locations all over the Western U.S., including 4 in the Bay Area. WTF? Shame on me. I wish I learned about it earlier. I would have been coming here more often, checking-in as a regular, and enjoying \"bang for your buck\" meals. 

Speaking of food, if you're craving a lil bit of everything for Breakfast, order \"The Grizz.\" It comes with 2 of their special pancakes, 3 eggs, 2 strips of bacon, 2 sausage links, 1 piece of ham steak and hash browns. They're pretty easy-going on changing things up if you desire. So instead of the 2 bacon strips, I replaced it with 2 more sausage links and in place of hash browns, I went with potatoes. Better. Much Better. 

I couldn't believe how big the portions were. I'm still thinking about it. The sausage links are not your average-sized links. No Jimmy Dean, you couldn't out do these sausages. And when the menu said ham steak, I didn't think it was a HUGE ham steak. Not really big but like I said, above-average, cooked just right. Also, the eggs came in 3 and not your usual 2. It helps to have one more. I was happy with the exchange of hash browns with potatoes. They weren't salty at all and they also threw in some chopped veggies. Good contrast in taste and made me wanna finish. I saved the pancakes for last. I didn't really see what was so special about them but just thought they were alright. If by special they meant size, then yes, they win there. Large pancakes for an already large meal. Overall, very complete meal, like it was meant for two.

Our waitress took our orders WITHOUT a pen and paper; she checked-in on us; AAAND she returned my friend's pair of very expensive sunglasses he had left on the table. Say it with me: WOW. I don't t remember the last time I received service like that but it deserves 5 stars on its own. Besides that, breakfast seems best served here. Diner joints like Denny's don't compare. They make Grand Slams look like a joke. 

The place is a little weird when you first walk in and see all the stuffed bears hung up across the walls and ceilings, as if someone has a fetish with furry animals or something. But it just feeds into the whole concept of the diner. I figured they must've won all the stuffed bears from Circus Circus, being that it's located in Vegas, but then again I haven't visited other Black Bear Diners so I wouldn't know. Anywho, I may not be in Vegas sometime soon to return here but at least now I have the pleasure of hitting up other ones closer to home. See for yourself."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I live across the street and we're here at least once a week. The food is ALWAYS amazing and you get huge portions for delicious leftovers for later. Try the sweet cream pancakes and thick cut bacon for breakfast with an order of their huge biscuits and gravy. 

The service is fantastic. I've never been at a restaurant where we consistently get the same attention from almost every member of the staff. We've never wanted for anything here because the friendly staff is always offering up any extras we didn't immediately think about. Try this place and I'm sure you'll love it."}
{"text":"I finally found a restaurant in Vegas that I will visit again!!!

I had the open faced turkey sandwich and a side salad. The turkey was all white meat and moist. The gravy was smooth and a perfect temperature. The lettuce in the salad was fresh - no brown pieces - and the ranch dressing had a nice mild taste. 

My husband had a scramble with ham and sausage. I tasted the hash browns and was pleasantly surprised because they were not greasy like many that you find. I also tasted his eggs and they were cooked perfectly - scrambled hard, just the way I like them.

Service was good as well. We did not wait to be seated or served. Our waitress was very nice and checked on us just the right amount of times. She also brought me a refill on my soda before I asked. 

Overall, it was a great experience. I will be going back to try one of my other standard meals (that I rate all restaurants by) - chicken burger, club sandwich, or french toast."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time after passing the one in Glendale a few times and wondering what it was all about. When I moved to Tolleson, finally decided to stop and was I ever glad I did. The food is outstanding and the portions are unbelievably large. This place is on my list of favorites very near the top. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast! Even on a busy weekend morning, the place works like  well-oiled machine. Everyone seems to know how to move efficiently and effectively in seating and serving people as quickly as possible.

The food is always delicious and the portions are large, so don't be afraid to share if you aren't that hungry."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely ridiculous we stood at the door waiting to be seated for 10 minutes before walking out. Horrible."}
{"text":"Amazing!! The food here is ridiculous! We are from out of town and when we visit Las Vegas we have to eat here every morning. The pancakes are out of this world. The chicken fried steak is tender and tasty.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The service is always exceptional. You must eat here if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast and service this morning. I had the \"Grizz\" and it was HUGE and delicious. 

This is our first time back since the last time we had poor service and the service was much improved and we had the same waitress we did last time. A much better experience."}
{"text":"Came here very hungry and ready for the long drive back home. We were seated right away which is a huge plus in my book. Mindy was an awesome server, very friendly and happy to be here. The portions are huge! The food was delicious! I will definitely look forward to coming back next year when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"Arrived with my middle school aged son at 1:15 today.  We were greeted and seated promptly by a sweet hostess who said, \"John, your waiter, will be here shortly.\"  We waited and waited and waited.  While we waited, staff cleaned three tables that vacated near us, filled two of those with new guests and served a drink to the table with new guest behind us.  At 1:44, John passed, paused, and said he'd be right with us.  Then he walked passed us again and proceeded to take the order of the lady who was behind us that was seated at least 20 minutes after we were.  At 1:45 we stood up and walked out - didn't need to pay for anything since we were not even served drinks.  And John acted surprised to see us leave????!!!!   Thanks anyway, but we will take our business somewhere that acts like they want us there.  I seriously started to think I was wearing an invisibility cloak."}
{"text":"Black bear diner has the best breakfast in Las Vegas.  Hands down. 

Service was great.  I was greeted upon arrival with a friendly smile.  I was promptly sat and brought drinks.  Beatrice was my waitress and recommend the French toast. 

By golly I was blown away.  The food came out fast and it was delicious. This was like moms home cooking.  The portion size was huge!  But since the food was so good it wasn't hard to eat it all!  

After my meal I was able to sit and chat with friends without being bothered about leaving.  Beatrice even kept our drinks full while we sat in talked.

I will certainly be returning. 

Try the French toast!"}
{"text":"My wife stop in to get me a turkey club to go as I was not well got
 it home looked nothing like the picture on the menu ! It was just a regular sandwich I could have made at home ( not a triple decker no turkey at all and just two slices of toast they should look at the menu it was a joke and I think it was around $12.00 for a $4.00 I will  not return!!"}
{"text":"Huge shoutout to Heath at Black Bear for the amazing guest service! I've eaten at this location a few times, but never bothered to write a review before now. I called in a to go order on Mother's day and Heath was awesome from beginning to end. He's super energetic, cheerful and efficient; all at 6:20 in the morning, when most of us are still bleary eyed in our beds. 

The food here is solid - huge portions of standard breakfast fare, done well. The Shasta scramble and California bacon Benedict are my favorites, and their hash browns are buttery and delicious. Their sweet cream pancakes are soooo fluffy and addicting. My only complaint is that they show you how many calories are in each dish so you can see just how much of a glutton you are. Make sure you save room for a bear claw, or at least take one to go! These babies are easily the size of my head, and always perfectly flaky and delicious. And if you join their e-club, you get a free coffee and bear claw just for signing up!"}
{"text":"I love bringing my family here. The service is always excellent! I order the chicken fried steak and eggs. My son enjoys lunch he gets the mini corn dogs and side of fruit. My dad is obsessed with their breakfast burritos with salsa. I don't think they have anything bad on the menu!! I still haven't tried their pies- something I need to do next time I go in!"}
{"text":"I've been here before a couple times but it's been awhile since I've been here and apparently it's the first time I've checked in! Haha. 

I don't remember what I got the last couple times but this time around my BF and I got the ScramBOWL and the California Bacon Benedict.

ScramBOWL: This was a mix of everything in here plus a nice big biscuit that comes with it. BF said it was pretty good. I tried it was yummy. Packed with lots of flavor.

California Bacon Benedict: I'm a Benny person, probably one of my favorite breakfast items, i don't need to say much but this was on point 

I feel bad but I forgot our server's name. He was very helpful, polite and didn't crowd. He was a good mix of giving us our space and checking in on us. The rest of the staff were kind as well. I guess that's why I like this place, good food and good staff."}
{"text":"Four stars is for the food. Went for breakfast with my daughter. Corn beef hash, fresh made, not canned, was outstanding and delicious big biscuits. Eggs Benedict was also very good. Portions are HUGE, we took home enough for another whole meal. Service was a bit spotty, but the place was packed. We had four different servers tend to us and they seemed to be all over the place, like they're not working assigned sections."}
{"text":"Country gravy was watery, the \"poached eggs\" on a Benedict were hard cooked. The manager/owner or whomever he was , was pushy on getting us out the door. The one star is for the pot roast. That was the only thing good. The meatloaf was dry and flavorless.  Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant and friendly servers. The host seemed pissed off and only gave us one placemat for a table of 3. Two of the three orders came out not only wrong but also cold and the coffee was not fresh at all. I could hear the cooks cussing and the hosts bickering. The server took a cup of coffee off of the bill to make up for the messed up orders but overall I was far from impressed with everything."}
{"text":"food was flavorless. We ordered a burger with fries and burger was dry and had no flavor fries tasted like freezer burn. Waffle was dry and chorizo burrito was loaded with excessive cheese wasn't even edible. Coffee was really bitter. Hot chocolate was beyond sweet. Won't ever be back."}
{"text":"So good!  Large portions for  sure.  Spicy sausage patty for breakfast was our favorite!  Our waiter Brett was great, service with a smile and fast.  I had the cinnamon roll French toast, very good.  My husband said the biscuit was a little dry and the gravy was a little thick and needed more sausage.  The blackberry and sugar free peach cobblers were not very good, however!  The fresh squeezed orange juice was delicious."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, haven't been here in a while. Waitress was great but the food was really bad. My Western burger was a frozen patty. Yes, a patty that was frozen that had that old cheap frozen consistency. It tasted just like the color grey, it was really bad. The cheese was supposed to be cheddar but it was clearly Kraft Singles American plastic cheese. That's fine and all if that's what it's supposed to have. Mayo no longer comes out in a plastic cup, it came out in a squeeze bottle from the grocery store. The fish and chips were frozen pieces of fish and almost inedible. I'm still willing to give breakfast a try again, I don't think the eggs are pre-scrambled and delivered in frozen bags. The gravy probably doesn't come frozen either but it's possible."}
{"text":"Well recommended. Quality of product is high, service is attentive and portions are large.

I've dined here about three times. I believe I can correctly describe the restaurant concept as \"50s diner/mountain lodge/Cracker Barrel ... dosing on massive quality & quantity steroids.\"

The entire breakfast/lunch/dinner menu, with the exception of baked potato, is available during all hours. Breakfast seems to be their long-suit, but it's all good.

The plate I've taken a shining to is the chicken-fried steak dinner. A massive portion, sure to please. 

\"The Grizz\" is a $13 breakfast that includes two large oval plates full of food -- eggs, bacon, sausage, ham steak, home fries and pancakes.

A wee bit pricey but again, the quality and portions are there.

You won't be making a mistake in checking this place out, for sure.

(Unless you are afraid of bears ... because there are hundreds of images and totems of bears scattered all over the joint. To the point of near nausea.)"}
{"text":"Another great breakfast yesterday morning!  I love BBD.  I  got the Portugese sausage and eggs.  And those sweet cream pancakes are, IMO, are better than Du-Par's.  The decor is kitschy with all the bears, but that is part of its appeal.  And again, the best diner coffee I have in a LONG while."}
{"text":"The Easter special crab and asparagus omelette was so good. Full of crab all the way through the omelette with a few pieces of asparagus that had just enough crisp still in them all wrapped in the egg with a white cream sauce over it. Plus hash browns and toast for only 10.99. I wish this was always on the menu as it Was one of the best I have had! 

Service- very attentive and nice

Decor- it's Black Bear"}
{"text":"Horribly slow service. The server did not even take our order when she brought the drinks and so far we have waited 30 minutes for our food- no update from the server nor an apology for it taking so long. Not impressed at all- if it were not for my friends wanting to stay, I would have left by now."}
{"text":"Food has been better, price is good and huge portions. If you can help it don't get water, either their filter broke or they use water from the sink in the bathroom. Had a great experience on St. Patrick's day. The corned beef and cabbage was good."}
{"text":"I came to Black Bear Diner while on a little 5 day vacation with my girlfriend and kids. We were there on Monday, 08/24/15. We were seated promptly and our drink orders were taken. Our drinks got to us in a timely manner. The guy that brought our drinks said the server would be with us shortly - \"shortly\" seemed to be longer than expected.

The waitress finally came and took our order. At this time, i asked the waitress for an orange juice for my daughter which she said she would bring out (it didn't come until i asked again for the orange juice once our food finally arrived - she didn't come back to our table from the time we ordered until we got our food). I would've hoped for a bit better service, since i was waiting on refills for my coffee and my water. 

The food was very good, I ordered the Hobo Joe Omelette. I will give this place another chance since the food was very good, hopefully i do get better service on my next visit.

I liked the atmosphere and decor as well. Very casual place where you can eat and relax."}
{"text":"What to say about average food, slow service from a server with no personality? Had to beg for coffee refills and my food was cold. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Don, the manager, was amazing and the food was delicious! WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE THE BISCUITS . We will be back again."}
{"text":"Thanks Ashton!

Such a solid casual option. The food quality, freshness and seasoning is spot on. Have tried many things over years from here will always Come back. Servers are attentive and thoughtful. Even saw a server bring a cool plate in concern for a child and a hot plate.


Yum. Stop in"}
{"text":"Awesome food and portions, excellent customer service! Always friendly service. Mexican fiesta May specials are delicious. Dessert pies are very tasty."}
{"text":"I have been to this diner in 3 states and so far, never a disappointment!! The portions are large, the prices are fair, the service has always been friendly, and the food is GOOD!! If you like a really homestyle feel, this will be your favorite place! Oh, and the atmosphere is also really cool - love the bears!! Think Country Bear Jamboree :)
Their biscuits are really good, but they are as big as your head!!"}
{"text":"Great old school kind of diner with country style southern cooking. Large portions, in fact so large you can either take half home or share with someone special. All the comfort foods you want. Great place for the family or just for some really tasty food."}
{"text":"After having breakfast here, I'm starting to think I love diners!

Spacious, tons of cool decorations (bear themed of course), a dessert / baked goods display upon entering and a very friendly staff!

Biscuits and gravy, chicken fried steak, and The Grizz (which has sweet cream pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage links, ham steak, and your choice of potato) were the choices the day we went.
Pancakes were very fluffy and the syrup that comes with it is to die for! I really have no idea what kind of syrup that was and I forgot to ask but it is very different than your usual \"maple syrup\"! Wish they sold it along with the merchandise up front but they only sell their berry syrup.
Chicken fried steak was cooked perfectly, crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside. Gravy could've used a little bit more salt for taste but was still good. My son loved their sausage, so much that he had to get another 3 because the 2 that came with The Grizz was not enough!

Portions are HUGE, so you get what you pay for!

Definitely a local joint and my type of comfort food! Can't wait for a return!"}
{"text":"Big Black Bear Breakfast

Great homemade breakfast. 

Fantastic corn beef hash!! 
This CBH was so savory, full of meat, the potatoes had a nice crispy texture and the onions perfectly carmalized. My eggs were cooked to order with a side of thick delicious baconand a homemade biscuit. Coffee was great.

The service was great. The waitress and cooks made breakfast even though they already started serving lunch. It was refreshing that the staff was so accommodating.  The restaurant was very clean and had a home style feel with all of the nostalgic decorations."}
{"text":"Black bear diner never disappoints 
we discovered this Jem  in Laughlin then we found one in orange county that we visited and now Las Vegas. 
We brought our best friends here for the first time and they absolutely loved it too.
The service is always great and friendly and the food is always fantastic and  consistently delicious.
If you're craving breakfast I highly recommend the chicken fried steak it's probably the best my fiancé and I have ever had & A great large portion.

I also tried their crispy chicken buffalo sandwich with coleslaw and pulled pork and that was pretty delicious too.

My friend had the pineapple pancakes and they very good.

If you're in Las Vegas and looking for a great place to eat whether it's breakfast lunch or dinner visit the Black bear diner you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Been here about four times with the family. The food is pretty good. That's why I'm giving it 3 stars. The staff is pretty nice also. The problem is they are painfully slow. We went on a saturday night. Got there at about 7:15 didn't leave until about 8:50. The main issue I see is that their is one person working the cash register and seating people. So If their is a line of people trying to pay for their meal then people needing to be seated are gonna have to wait. We waited quite a while. Finally we got seated. From the looks of things they are usually under staffed so everything is a wait. We waited a good amount of time to order our drinks and it took a lot of time to get those drinks. Our food order took forever. Now keep in mind the place isn't packed. They have a good amount of people but it isn't like crazy hectic busy. Our server seemed like he was on in berzerker mode. He told us he had been there since 8am and was working until closing. So I think it supports my theory they are understaffed. But food isn't bad. I'd stay away from the chicken pot pie. They put a ton of mushrooms and the pie itself is quite small compared to say Claim Jumpers pot pie."}
{"text":"They were able to sit our table of 10 -- on Easter Sunday -- without a reservation in about 10 minutes. That deserves 3 stars right there. The service was just OK but the food was quick and got to our table relatively fast.

We appreciated just being able to sit down, get served with no frills. We ended up going for a second meal later in our visit as well just because you knew what you were going to get."}
{"text":"4.5 stars
I came here for breakfast and liked it more than I expected. I had seen these places in California before but thought it was something different. My loss... until now! The inside might be lined with stuffed animals like your grandmas house or little sisters room but don't let any of that fool you. This place is solid.  

So I ordered The Volcano breakfast. 3 pancakes (made with sweet cream), 2 pieces of bacon, scrambled eggs with cheese and a sausage patty. The pancakes were great and the bacon was cooked to order. The sausage is made at the restaurant and has a nice taste and my eggs were hot and good. It was a nice pile of food for $8. Our waitress was very good and even stopped to talk to us about the restaurant and some of the popular things on the menu. 

OH YEAH..... check out the humongous bear claws they have in the glass case as you walk in."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite diners. I've been to serval time in California and when I found one while vacationing in Vegas, I had to go. I had a wonderful experience. My server Candy was kind and fast. I love that she asked to split the check and did assume we all paying together. I ordered chicken sandwich that was interesting yet delicious. Although I wasn't fond of the extra bread I received it was and easy fix to just remove it."}
{"text":"I have been to the The Black Bear Diner on three occasions, now.  I originally gave the diner five stars.  The first time we went was on a Saturday at about 12:30 pm.  We had to wait about 15 minutes, but it was well worth the wait.  The server was great!  She was very attentive and kept the coffee coming!  We asked for extra gravy, for these amazing, fresh, fluffy and huge biscuits and she made sure we had enough!  

The second and third time we visited the diner, we had different servers, each of which forgot part of our orders, seemed uninterested and rushed to give us our checks, like they had something pressing to do.  The funny thing is that the restaurant was more than half empty on the other two occasions.  These days were on a Thursday evening and a Friday afternoon consecutively.  The worst part of these last two visits is that the biscuits were stale and hard and the gravy tasted old and had too much pepper.  Big Disappointment!  Because of the last two visits, I can only give the diner a three overall.  I'm unsure if I will even go back at this point.  Too bad because it's a really cute concept for a diner with all of the wood carved and stuffed bears everywhere and the homey feeling it portrays."}
{"text":"This place is so good I love it I will be back, it's so clean, the staff is supper nice, the food is so good."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here. The food is country homestyle cooking. It was delicious. The waiter Carol made us feel comfortable  and the Manager crisis was really easy going and welcoming."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in Vegas! The atmosphere is fantastic and is backed up by amazing food and even better service! While we were here on a very busy Saturday the manager of the store was walking around handing all the small kids balloons. Although they were super full the entire staff was friendly and efficient. Our waitress April was so wonderful and friendly. Every experience I have had here has been amazing. If I could give them more stars I would! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Soooooo when I initially thought about writing this review I did not think I would be giving this place 2 stars. I mean I really thought it would be better than that because everyone I know recommended it and suggested it. 

First let me say that I honestly did not like the interior and the decor. It reminded me of an old restaurant in need of a makeover. The carpet was dirty and in need of sweeping. 

The wait was not that bad because I called ahead. We were seated and the waitress was there pretty quickly. We ordered drinks and pigs in a blanket for the kids and took a few minutes to look over the menu. 

We decided on Huevos Rancheros per the waitress suggestion and the California bacon Benedict. 

When the food arrived the portions were rather large. Just on first look the food looked like slop. Huevos Rancheros beans were like out of a can and chorizo I couldn't even find. The tortilla on the bottom was suppose to be flat and it was burned and curled up. And oh the worst of all we're the hash browns. Soggy. Soft and bland. Honestly nothing could save this meal. 

The California Benedict was a little better but still not up to par. The hollandaise sauce was so unappetizing and had no flavor. The whole dish needed salt. 

Needles to say we did not finish either meal. As I sat there waiting for the kids to finish the pigs in a blanket I decided to try them and they were actually really good. This is the reason for the 2 stars and not 1. 

For a few minutes sitting there I watched the plates come out of the kitchen and everything looked burned. I am very disappointed and perhaps we ordered the wrong meals but it certainly did not leave a good impression on me. 

Not sure if I will be back."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time yesterday and it was an AMAZING experience. I have been looking for a local diner since I moved into town. Many of my southern California friends rave about this place so I had to see what it was about. Bottom line is, IT DID NOT DISAPPOINT. 
I ordered the New York Steak and Eggs with Country Potatoes and Sourdough toast. I happily ate the whole thing and I had to have more. I tried the chocolate lava cake with chocolate ice cream and it was amazing. 
I was insanely impressed. My server William was amazing as well. 
I will be coming back. Definately my new go to place."}
{"text":"LOVE Black Bear Diner!  It is absolutely one of my favorite places to grab breakfast.   It's definitely a comfort food type place.  I highly recommend it to anyone.  Though it can be quite busy at times, it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"This Black Bear is amazing! I was recently turned on to the restaurant chain after hearing so many good things. Collectively I've now had the big bacon breakfast and the chicken fried steak. Both were honestly the best I've had at \"chain\" breakfast joints. Makes IHOP and Denny's look silly. The bacon was fancy store level quality and the chicken fried steak tasted so fresh and recently prepared. The price point vs the portion size makes this place a great value. By the way the biscuits are huge! Do yourself a favor and check this place out. Cinnamon bun French toast is up next!"}
{"text":"On our way outta Phoenix and stopped by just to go somewhere different. We didn't have to wait long to be seated although they looked busy. Enjoyed our meals and dessert- we got the volcano breakfast and the special meal of chicken sandwich and fries. It was all good for the price. The pies looked great so we got a banana cream pie. It was delicious although a proper pie crust would be nice too. The server was nice and efficient and the food came out pretty quickly. A nice experience!"}
{"text":"The food was very good! The music was very loud ask them to turn down which they did but only for one song then turned back up. Employees were sing along I guess at this Black Bear diner the employees are more important than the customers!!"}
{"text":"Very good comfort food restaurant with a country touch. Decor is of a bear in the woods atmosphere. Food is old fashion but very very great tasting! And the pies, yum!! If you are in the Phoenix area this a must!"}
{"text":"Second meal here. Food fabulous.  Server Shaun was great. Glad I have it another chance."}
{"text":"I know many people rave about this place, but the two times I've been there I have not been very impressed. I have only been for breakfast, so I cannot speak for the rest of the menu. My first complaint is that all of our food was never brought out at the same time. I typically eat with at least 3 other people and my 18 month old and there is always someone waiting on their food for an additional 10 minutes. So basically they either have to sit there and wait while watching everyone else eat, or everyone else's food is cold by the time the final person's food arrives. The last time we were there I ordered an omelet. It said it came with cheese, but there was none in the omelet and a tiny sprinkle on top. So it basically was just a ton of mushrooms disproportionate to the amount of egg. I can probably think of two instances in my life where I have had to send food back, and this was one of them. I asked them to please put cheese in the omelet, like most omelets are made, and when it came back out they it was smothered in cheese. I liked it, but it was obvious they were purposely trying to do the exact opposite of my complaint to be obnoxious. To top it off, the waitress who had been working there for quite some time was completely unfamiliar with the menu. She also kept forgetting our drinks and never brought out a complete meal at one time. It was awful. So, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Always friendly service and large portions.   One of the things I love the most about Black Bear Dinner is that they are always concerned about getting your order right. Your satisfaction is really important to them. The servers always answer my questions about ingredients and although I am a very picky eater, I have never had to return an order here, unlike many other restaurants. 
The decor is unique and fabulous. My husband and I get a real sense of family when we eat here and my husband always comments the food is better than home cooking because it is tasty but we don't have to do the dishes. Love this place and it seems whichever Black Bear Dinner we have been to, the consistency in food and atmosphere is accurate."}
{"text":"I am a breakfast kind of guy. Always checking for the good breakfast place when I am in a new town/area. After a locals recommendation and some Yelp reading on the BBD went there to sample the fare. Outstanding breakfast food. First trip had over easy eggs, which are not easy to prepare, my compliments. Second trip an omelet which was very well prepared. This place rivals my at home breakfast place which I have a great prejudice for. Outstanding pancakes, delicious hash browns and good, strong coffee. Went on a Sunday and had to wait, a short wait but a wait and worth the wait it was. A weekday trip immediate seating. Warm, friendly, attentive service and food at very reasonable price(s) ."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 6 stars.  We've been going more regularly now, about once a week on the weekends, and the service is just great and the food is great.  

We went yesterday, I tried something new, the Chicken Fried Steak and it was delicious.  Everyone working there makes sure you're having a solid experience.  

I know updates are if something changes, but I can't give this place enough good reviews.  It's my favorite place in the valley.

Mike, Tahra, Jeff, and the rest are just fantastic.  Keep it up."}
{"text":"So me and my girl decided to wrap up our Vegas vacation by having one last bite to eat before we had to the airport we decided to stop at Black Bear after randomly searching on Yelp for local places to eat breakfast so when we decided to come in it was very warm and welcoming very homey with bears everywhere. the breakfast was delicious came out very prompt the wait staff was very nice. Plenty of parking the food came out warm very beautiful and very large portions."}
{"text":"Incredible breakfast!!! Everything is super-sized. Too much food for one person to handle. Great food and quaint atmosphere. Recommend to anyone who is really, really hungry. Most things have gravy on it so it's definitely not for the health minded...
Question... \"Which Bear is Best?\"

{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile so when this last Tuesday rolled around and the kids wanted breakfast for dinner, we jumped in the car and headed to Black Bear. Kids eat free on Tuesday! Hooray!!

This place is super cute. On a Tuesday night it was busy but easy to get a table. I'm sure it's packed on weekend morning. They have a little retail area in the front with little stuffed bears, soaps, lotions, and bear claw back scratchers. We were seated right away and our server came right over to take our drink order. 

The kids each had the mini volcano (two pancakes with an egg on top, sausage link, and bacon). (4.99/ea but both were free) I had the corned beef hash with red potatoes and a biscuit. (9.99, I think). My husband ordered the trout (not something that he would usually order but wanted something different), with mashed potatoes and vegetables. (8.49) They carry about three Bear Republic beers (bombers) so he ordered the black IPA not knowing how much they were going to charge. Get this. Only $5.45!!! Cheap!

The girls loved their breakfast dinner. It was a lot of food and they weren't able to finish it but they put a big dent in it. The pancakes? WOW! They were really good. Corned beef hash was really good. Small serving of corned beef, huge serving of potatoes. Biscuit was dry and inedible, probably because it was baked in the morning and I was eating it at 5:30pm. Hubby liked his food too.

We will be back, for sure. I'm getting the pancakes next time."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast with my daughter. It was our first time trying Black Bear. Greeter was not very \"greeting\" but he was very young and I could tell he was stressed with the breakfast rush. He found us a table and the waitress came by 2 mins later. Everything was going normal. I ordered the California Omelet w/biscuit and my daughter got the Pineapple Upside-Down Cakes.  My plate was delivered quickly, within 8 minutes. My daughter's however, another 6-7 minutes after mine. I was soooo hungry but didn't want to start eating until my daughter's meal was there too. Our waitress didn't apologize, explain, or acknowledge the incident. I enjoyed my omelet and my daughter loved her pancake. The biscuit was a generous size but very dry. The waitress never returned. Not to check in on us, refresh the coffee, or even bring the bill. After waiting and waiting we headed back up to he front where the frazzled host was. I explained that I didn't have a bill to pay and asked for a manager. The poor host had 4 tables come to pay their bill right then. I told him to help out the other customers, I could keep waiting. The manager finally arrived and she asked for my table number, lol. How should I know?  Then she asked for my bill to look over. \"Uh, I just told you I never got it.\"  The manager walked around and found our waitress. (More waiting). Finally, the manager came up with the genius idea to comp our meals. I'm sure you've figured it out - I'm not going back."}
{"text":"First stop after my flight to Vegas from Hawaii. Food was delicious, service was great. Portions are huge, prices very reasonable. I had the chicken and waffles. First time ever trying this dish. Yummy!!!! Took my friends few days after to another location in Vegas. This time service was slow for some reason but was greeted with hospitality and food still was on point. Will definitely return to the location nearer the airport. Aloha!"}
{"text":"Want good diner food, but not starving?  Big Bear offers items on their \"A Little Less \" menu

During lunch break some co-workers and I were looking for a place that had something to offer everyone, and Black Bear fit the bill.

It's a homey atmosphere with lots of bear paraphernalia and a newspaper menu.  It's seen better days but was certainly packed at lunchtime.

I went for the patty melt and while it wasn't the worst I've had it wasn't that great either.  Kinda bland. 

What I really like is that instead of the typical french fries or onion rings on the side, you can have a cup of soup instead.  As with the patty melt, the chicken soup was average.

I have to admit I'm curious about the chicken fried steak after reading another review.  I may have to try it one of these days, but I won't go out of my way to get there."}
{"text":"RAWR! The corner of Green Valley and Sunset has turned into bear country with Black Bear Diner!  Good to see that this family diner based in No Cali has expanded again with a corporate location now open in the Green Valley area of Henderson. 

Happy to have a place that serves breakfast all day and is open early and past 3pm unlike the breakfast places in the area. The newsletter type menu also lists lunch and dinner plates too!  Country homestyle comfort is the cuisine here. Sweet Cream waffles and pancakes, Country Fried Steak, Hot Tuna Melts, Pot Roast are just some examples.  

The serving portions are pretty big. Enough to feed a hungry bear. Even the cornbread muffin we had was pretty good size and more than enough for one person.

Cool points - They recognized the health & calorie conscious crowd . Sections throughout the menu list:

\"Fit and Focus: breakfast offerings under 500 calories

\"Little Less\": smaller portions of some of the breakfast, lunch and dinner items. I ordered lunch from this section which was a Tuna Melt and it came with your choice of side;  fries, housemade potato salad, coleslaw, green salad OR cup of soup. 

They allow substitutions.IE..If you are vegetarian or want gluten free they'll switch out the bacon for fruit. 

Prices are a great value for what you get. 

Quality of food, fair/good. Many items made in-house, the oranges are freshly squeezed thru an industrial sized juicer. 

Execution wise..needs more work...The hashbrowns on the first visit we got were not drained well enough and was a bit greasy.  Our second try at it we ordered it to be more crisp...still greasy..sigh.. Sweet Cream pancakes were okay. At least they weren't dense but not that fluffy either. 

Orders took longer than should be and first time they got my order mixed up with Mr. B.  ..minor glitches, but cutting them slack since they've been open less than a week.

Not a fan of servers closing out the tab and giving you the receipt and you pay cashier..it's more convenient yes, but it just feels more rushed and you don't see your server much after they hand you the ticket. 

Atmosphere - Casual but not feeling the rustic lodge feel like their Redding location.  But every location is different and unique in it's own way. So since we're in the desert it's faux lodge ish.

They did a great job revamping this building that has been an eyesore for the past 3 years. Great use of space, plenty of booths and tables.There's even diner counter style seating in front of the partially open kitchen. 

I was thrilled to see and hear that the same guy still carves all the wooden bears (with a chainsaw) It was tradition when we traveled we would make stops at Black Bear Diners and our kids would take a pic with the bears that were 3x their size.

Service - Great personalities! Friendly and eager to please. Still needs work on a few areas.  Both visits we sat at our table for a good 5 minutes before anyone came and acknowledged us and take our drink order.  They apologized though for the wait. Some of the employees from their Cali restaurants flew over here to help out and train as the \"Opening Crew\" . 

Really 3.5 but rating 4 for for value and for the choices they offer... plus the nostalgia won me over.  In time the Green Valley crew will rock the fifth star. Welcome to the Hendo hood Black Bear Diner!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I'm very upset. Our waitress, her name's Jaimie forgot to refill our lemonade having to come by three times to see how we were doing and forgot my order so instead of getting it she changed the bill. I still wanted my order. The food was delish tho..the cinnamon french toast.

She even asked if we wanted lemonade to go but never came back for it, but the one thing she didn't forget was the to go bags. Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Worst service in my 51 years of my life, I am a coach and have been out to eat a countless number of times but to be seated at 7 and for some people in the group to not get there food until after 9pm and to be told they are short handed in the kitchen but I see a party of three get severed eat and leave after we have been there two hours and some in our party still doesn't have there food. WORST SERVICE IN MY LIFE AND WE SPENT $400! If I could they would not get 1 star!"}
{"text":"Thanks to yelp and all of you fab reviewers we pulled up to Black Bear. Our service was absolutely excellent and our waitress was very attentive and really gave us that hometown diner experience!

I enjoyed the sweet cream pancakes and the chicken and apple sausage was the best I've had! They had something for everyone in our family bunch of 7 and serve breakfast all day. Not one of us was disappointed. Thanks Yelp & Black Bear! 'Til next time for sure!"}
{"text":"Clean diner. Friendly staff. Nice air-conditioned environment.
I ordered the steak and eggs special. Price was right but the steak was not steak. It tasted like mushed up processed meat reformed into a steak and left an extremely bad aftertaste in my mouth. Perhaps they should consider getting actual steak or mentioning that it is processed and seasoned.
The hash browns were good and made from actual potato but that is about it."}
{"text":"\"To Be Least Desired\"

I was looking for good food, flavor and service... Well only part of this criteria was met. The food was decent, the flavor was okay, and the service was \"least desired.\" 

Cons: after seated we were not serviced right away it was like they forgot about us. 
-once served the waitress did not check back to ensure all was well and she did not provide WATER refills?? Seriously? 
-We had to wait for them to recognize we were done to check out.. 

Pro: LARGE portions, sweet cream pancakes are decent, kinda sweet. 

This place obviously has been around for a while and people flock to it because of the large portions and convenience. If you are looking for something to fill you up and not so great service, YES! Come here... 

Otherwise try somewhere else!"}

{"text":"Driven a million times when I used to live on this side of town but never stopped until a new breakfast location became a topic of conversation in the work place.

Did not know BBD was part of a chain until we started doing research when we arrived.  Our server was friendly and promptly took our order.  Our coffee and water was never empty.

I ordered up the CFS.  It was a damn fine...FINE piece of breaded meat!  The gravy was a nice compliment and not the kind that round house kicks your guts a few hours later.

BBD is home to the magic pancake!  My memory escapes me on just how it was ordered.  Perhaps, it was just to sample and then again...maybe to satisfy some sort of high carb addiction.  The pancake required NO SYRUP!  NONE!  It was sweet, light and fluffy and defied my expectation of what a diner pancake should be.  

It awesome watching the plate float around the table as it allowed the others in our party an opportunity to enjoy.  The second best part of the experience was watching or fellow Black Bear explorer dump a portion of the scolding hot syrup which accompanied (unwarranted and not needed) the mystical flap jack on his lap.  Well, one side of his lap.  HIs GF must have marveled at the one half, maple Brazilian he gave himself.

As I roamed out the parking lot, high on fat, sugar, caffeine and carbs, I stopped to look at some of the photos of celebs who have eaten here, and who should I spy...Nicholas Cage wearing some funky outfit!  Had the academy award winner been dining there that day, I would have had to quit yelping because I doubt any experience would have been better than that."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating lunch at a Black Bear Diner, the first one was in Fernley Nevada. The in Tempe met my expectations.

I had the bacon cheeseburger (cooked medium well), fries and iced tea. I also tried their homemade bacon dip for the fries which was pretty good. They have an assortment of sauces so I tried the chipotle sauce on my burger which was flavorful and fairly spicy. I'd say the food at the Black Bear Diner is traditional American food with some good variations. The iced tea is just iced tea but isn't bad. 

The atmosphere is like an alpine lodge with 50s diner music piped in. The AC works well so bring a sweater. The only thing I didn't care for was being seated right by the kitchen doors when the restaurant was half empty, but since it wasn't super busy it wasn't that much of a nuisance."}
{"text":"It's good. Nothing extravagant. The corned beef hash was not as good as I thought it would be. Staff was nice and the place was clean."}
{"text":"Best corned beef hash, coffee, bacon ever! Place was busy with two huge parties. I think that's why the service was slow. Great food, large portions but could have been hotter. Great place for kids and sharing. Don't plan on sharing the corned beef hash cause your gonna want to eat it all yourself.  Good home made salad dressing."}
{"text":"Hometown cooking at its best. Great all you can eat fish special on friday nights. My other favorite is country fried steak and eggs! Hashbrowns are my favorite."}
{"text":"We debated 3 or 4 stars. I always give the benefit of the doubt and tip well as standard. Maybe not this time. We came in for lunch, first time. No waiter, then he rushed us ordering, not helping with options we considered. The portion size was huge. Hubby got the scrambowl and couldn't eat but half of it, which is unusual. I tried the turkey avocado sandwich with broccoli soup. The soup was terrible but the sandwich was good, took half of it home.  Service was terrible, nice person, but not around. Not sure what was going on, our drinks were empty for a while. I had to ask the cashier for honey for my biscuit and a nice waitress rushing by grabbed some on her way back to her tables. Hubby wants to try this place again. I'd rather not, except many customers checking out said how amazing thier wait staff was. Maybe our table was the odd one out. But with so many other options out there, maybe not this location again."}
{"text":"Small volcano breakfast for me and steak and eggs for her. Both were good. Pancakes are killer!"}
{"text":"My food wasn't too hot or too cold, it was just right.  Goldilocks would be happy.  

I had a good lunch experience at Black Bear.  I realize it's a chain but it was my first time dining at their establishment.  We were greeted and seated immediately.  The dining area is a plentiful area.  Of course you're met with the decor of a log cabin.  

I chose to indulge in the Chicken Avocado Club with fries.  This triple stack sandwich had a great balance of chicken, avocado, cheese and blt. It was a very tasty sandwich and too much for me to eat in one sitting.  That only means I have dinner for later.  :-)  The French fries are good but not great.  

For dessert my friend and I split the Cinnamon Apple Cream Pie.  It was ok.  I will say it is more than enough for two to split.  

Service here is ok.  I think our waiter could have been a little friendlier.  Once he dropped off our bill he didn't want to make eye contact with us.  We had to flag him down to get dessert.   

I'm sure I'll be back to try out another meal.  Hopefully the service is improved."}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner has food that is consistently way above average; however, where they really shine is in their customer service!  The entire team reminds me of Texas Southern Hospitality.  I've lived in Las Vegas for 3 years+ and their hospitality keeps me coming back!

I've traveled all across the USA and eaten at thousands of restaurants, and their Sweet Cream Pancakes are amazing and the best I've ever had!  I highly recommend adding a pancake as a side if your dish doesn't come with it!

You will have a great eating experience if you come here!  Thanks to the Black Bear Staff for their years of dedication to amazing customer service!"}
{"text":"Food is decent, servers have been there a while and can be cranky ladies at times. Wait is always long. It's an ok place... Nothing too spectacular."}
{"text":"We went here last year with some friends and the food and staff was great! I will definitely go back. I liked it because it's super cozy. The menus look like newspapers and there are bears covering the walls. It looks like it belongs up in the mountains somewhere, not in the desert haha. But it was enjoyable."}
{"text":"I have been to the Black Bear Diner before at its second location in Redding, California. The diner in Las Vegas was not the same experience. The staff at the Vegas location did not have good hospitality. They need to brush up on common courtesy like saying please and thank you.  I ordered the standard Eggs Benedict. The meal was good. I was asked if I want regular hash browns or the diced red potatoes. I ordered the regular hash browns. When I received my meal they gave me the red potatoes. I did not send them back I just ate what they gave me. They were actually pretty good, it was just I did not order them. My wife ordered the Club Eggs Benedict that is a seasonal item. They totally messed up that one. The meal was missing the bacon and tomatoes. The waitress never came by to check up on how we liked the food. It was just order and drop off. My wife just ate the food and just made the best of it. When I went to pay the bill the cashier was equally inattentive and lacked manners. The cashier did not use manners even after I was being polite and said thank you. Besides not being happy with service, the food was actually pretty good at Black Bear. It is too-bad this location is allowing their staff to be inattentive to customers."}
{"text":"We came after our first visit to Black Bear in Bullhead City. We were hoping that it wasn't a fluke how good it was, and it was not. It was just as yummy as before! The pancakes were great, as were the waffles, and the service was awesome. It only took 4 minutes to get our food, and the place was packed. 

We will be back!

In fact, as I write this, we are deciding where to go to lunch, and I hope this is where my wife picks... I want Fish & Chips. :-)"}
{"text":"This is my 4th time visiting this location and service is terrible!!! This last visit we waited for over 30min for our food and the restaurant was pretty much empty. When the food finally arrived at the table it was slightly warm. The visit before this last visit I ended up walking out because I sat there for 20-30min without anyone even taking my order and again the restaurant was nearly empty.  Being that work in the industry myself I understand that when business is slow, you have to send people home but when customer service begins to suffer because of it i feel something needs to be done because this is definitely one guest that will definitely not be returning. I will be returning to Biscuit's Cafe where I get great service every time and the food is always hot."}
{"text":"You will DEFINITELY get a BUNCH of food per order. So be prepared to take left overs home. Our waitress was so great... So nice to our 2 year old. She was very aware of things she put down in front of him to make sure it wasn't within his reach. It's little things like that that make my job as a Mama a little bit easier. Great food, great service, will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Huge portions! Their cream pancakes are so tasty! The sausage was a little spicy but so good! The bacon is thick sliced and was delicious! I had the scrambled eggs with cheese, bacon and biscuits and gravy for $9.99. My husband had the pancakes, sausage and eggs. It all was very delicious! 
It is decorated in the inside like a cabin with black bear's everywhere.  It's very cozy and comfortable. 
They do serve mini pies like cherry pie and coconut cream pie that looked yummy!
I was unable to finish all my food. The waitress said, \"we serve enough to feed a bear\"! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"After coming to eat breakfast here and loving it, I thought dinner would be great as well. It took a while to get our drink order taken and when our waiter finally came to take our order it was 7 pm, after he took our order he proceeded to take the orders of the other two tables that arrived after us and handing some to-go boxes to other tables instead of giving it to the cooks! The rest of the other tables got their orders out, ate and were waiting to get the check, when our waiter finally notices that we haven't gotten our food!! 38 minutes pass for our waiter to notice that we didn't have our food! He comes and reads to us \"our order\" which wasn't even ours and after we tell him it's not ours he runs to the kitchen, comes back and tells me that they're out of what I ordered which was the chicken pot pie. He continues to blame the cooks because they're 'new and don't know what they're doing and didn't inform him that they were out.' So, you mean to tell me that after almost 40 mins you decided to check on your \"check\" that you supposedly put in? And the cooks JUST told you that they're out? That's ridiculous! I am also a waitress and I would never let 40 min go by without having checked on my food to be ready. The service sucked! Not only because of that experience but we got no refills, never got checked on, nothing! We had to be flagging down our waiter for the check. My table wasn't the only one, every table around us were finished with their food waiting for the check and our sever was nowhere to be found... Honestly don't know if I'll be back after this unprofessional experience."}
{"text":"I've heard good things about black bear diner so I was excited to get the opportunity to try it.  Post-experience, it's not some place I'll go out of my way again to eat.

Also, the coffee is gross.  Leaves a weird film in your mouth. 

And that's that. :)"}
{"text":"Naturally reviewing another joint relating to breakfast because I love love breakfast!!

Any way, the decor is cute and devoted to its name black bear. It's a family friendly restaurant and I'm not sure if the southern accents are real but they're cute. We were seated immediately but it was about 9 on a Wednesday so I can't tell you for sure if they ever get super busy but I have a feeling they do. The location is about 4 miles from where we stayed off the strip so it's not a terrible drive.

The hostess who sat us didn't really help us much because we hadn't been there and we were confused as to why we didn't get menus but they are in the paper (actual newspaper looking) she sat us with. So that was cute.

We ordered the classic eggs benedict and the country fried steak. Both super delicious. Hand down the best chicken fried steak because the batter is so light and you can cut the steak with the butter knife. Anthony chose to have a biscuit with his meal which was light and fluffy and delicious with both butter and jelly. My eggs benedict we delicious and I had never had it with slices of ham instead of a ham steak and that was yummy because I got more ham with my bite. They also come with a bowl of fruit and hash browns which were crispy on top and fluffy in the middle.

Both dishes were delicious and we can definitely see ourselves coming back."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good.  California Bacon Benedict that I had was a good choice.  Star deductions are for slow service and just lack of acknowledgement as my iced tea glass sat empty for a very long time. Took food a long time to get kicked out of the kitchen!  Paying tab at the register is another long wait.  Certainly things they need to address as it seems to be a common gripe amongst reviewers!"}
{"text":"Love the black bear. The friendly staff, the cozy cabin interior and the magnificent breakfast. Order the volcanoe or the sweet cream pancakes. Delish!"}
{"text":"Deserves 10 stars and its own category!
We were in LV on vacation and we prefer to find the locals' hangouts rather than the national chains and strip buffets.
Having said that:
1. best decaf coffee I had the entire trip - smooth, fresh.  DH said the regular was equally as good (I had 3 cups with breakfast - unheard of for me!!).
2. great selection of breakfast options.  I found the perfect \"size\" for me (less than the volcano which DH had, but bigger than the senior plate).
3. sweet cream pancakes - too die for!  just wonderful! freshly made, not heavy, very rich, very buttery.
4. sausage - they say they make their own.  I am from PA where many butcher shops make their own sausage so I think I am quite a good judge there - and their sausage was fantastic!  Grilled, not deep fried like so many places today.
5.  eggs over easy were just that - and not covered in grease.
6.  wait staff was perfect - paid attention to refilling and checking on you but not \"in your face\" - so hard to find that balance anymore.

So do yourself a favor - if you are there on vacation, venture up to the BBD with the locals - you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I had no idea this was an extensive Southwest and West Coast chain when we arrived here, but boy was I happy we stopped in.  It was the perfect place to stop in and fill up on the way to zion - the breakfast menu is EXTENSIVE and the specials even more.  I got the huevos rancheros - and boy did they not disappoint. My husband got eggs with some sort of Mexican twist - might have been called Fiesta eggs - but whatever it is, the beans, the eggs, the sauces, service, and price points were all AMAZING. I would go back here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Hi, I am next to you from  MK Nova Barber/Salon. Just wanna tell you , your food so so so good. I like very much tacco-salad.. I like your decor in side too,. thank you so much .   See you soon."}

{"text":"Excellent breakfast and lunch... Traditional American style.  Friendly waitress too.  Recommended."}

{"text":"So....

Was hungry af and standing right next to IHOP which is always more expensive and gives you smaller portions and Black Bear so I opted for Black Bear.    It was morning so I thought maybe it will be a different service + I was alone so I thought maybe I can get in, sit somewhere obvious, lol.

Service wasnt bad at all.
The food was perfectly cooked

I was happy when I left and it only cost me $12 so...."}
{"text":"Another dice adventure, this place is really always a hit, this location at least.

The die instructed me to order ham and eggs so I did, it was good, though I am not a big ham person and wished I could have had my patty sausage but thats ok, thats why we dice, to push us into new experiences, why go somewhere and always order the same thing?

My ex ended up ordering his usual, bacon and eggs and loved it.  The coffee is always strong and good and very hot, we never have to wait for refills.    Service is outstanding as usual and Rubarb--our Black Bear always goes with us and they make sure to ask him what he wants to eat or drink.    :)

Most restaurants would just ignore him but of course he is their mascot.    hehe"}
{"text":"Soooo good. We were craving breakfast for dinner and decided to try this place and glad we did. The service was great they were friendly and welcoming. The best part was the biscuits they are huge but soft and even still good the next day. Family friendly and clean."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time going to Black Bear Diner. I had an awesome experience thanks to night shift supervisor Marlene. Upon discovering it was my first time at Black Bear Diner, she made me feel more than welcome and explained some good menu choices. I had the breakfast burritos and they were amazing. I also tried the Apple cobbler which was unforgettably scrumptious."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places i have been to. Food portions are filling, i was warned ahead of time longest wait was 15 mins great prices everything reasonable. I def will come back when i i find one anywhere i go, wish we had one in san diego"}
{"text":"This place is everything you could ever want in a diner. The food is awesome, service rocks and the atmosphere is cozy! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Really good food. Served very hot and fresh. Ham and cheese omelet was just OK, but fried potatoes and homemade biscuit were over the top. Service was A++. Quick seating and prompt service were a big bonus. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Best corned beef hash ever.  Diner is awesome."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong.  Big portions, small prices, good food and service.  Breakfast all day if you want it."}
{"text":"First time here. Outstanding customer service 
Very California themed. Menus are like newspapers. The food was great quality and perfect portions. Although it was really cold when we walked in, everything else was on point. Will return again, would recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Really great food and believe it or not cheaper than ihop.My fav is the chorizo & eggs or chicken fried steak brkfst. usually no wait and fast service."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place hundreds of times without any desire to stop in (I'm not exactly the camping wilderness type of gal) but of course my man mentioned trying it many times so I finally gave in. It helped that I received a $20 comp :)
So we went & here's how things went down...
You can't help but notice it's all seniors. I say this in a nice way because I love old folks & if they allowed me to live in their neighborhoods here I would so be into it! You see hundreds of bears everywhere (weird). The green carpet was stained everywhere (please replace your carpet). The booth we were sat in had a bright light above our heads that kept going on & off (felt like a bad version of EDC) with tons of old folk.
So let's get to the food. Mediocre. I will say that the sizes were massive but unfortunately I didn't have the desire to finish anything. Everything felt so heavy that I felt guilty for hours afterwards. 
The highlight was my freshly squeezed orange juice, it was the bomb!"}
{"text":"First off, I cannot vouch for dinner here, hence why I'm only rating it four stars initially but the breakfasts are definitely the main attraction for me. The Eggs Benedict are insanely good and the orange juice is freshly squeezed and the hash browns are a must have. I've been there several times now and neither I nor any of my dining companions have ever had a single complaint and service has always been excellent. There can be a bit of a wait at times but it's well worth it. I've been wanting to try the mini-pies that are on display near the register but alas I've never had the room after downing the large portioned breakfast platters."}
{"text":"Can you say delicious?! I love coming for breakfast here!!! Went in at 9am and the restaurant wasn't too busy! On the weekends though this place can get crazy! So do expect to wait a while! 

The portions are HUGE. Yes HUGE. Bear sized meals... Prices are reasonable for the amount of food that you get. Food does taste good though! 

The service was okay, we had to hunt down our waitress for refills and she only checked up on us once."}
{"text":"Disappointed... you ask the hostess do you have gluten free options she said no!!! You ask the waitress she also said no!!! But you open the menu they do serve a gluten free bun!!! Would never go back it wasn't a good dining experience"}
{"text":"Although it's one of the few sit down restaurants in Laveen, it would easily be one of the best if there were more. Good variety on the menu and the service has been outstanding each time we've been there for dinner."}
{"text":"Best country breakfast in the city.  This is a bit of a drive off the strip, but when i am in town, this is where i go and it is worth it.  I love the spicy homemade sausage patty with my crisp hash browns.  The juice is always fresh.  The service is always friendly and the manager has been there as long as i can remember.   Great locals hang out.

If you have the time, make the trip out here."}
{"text":"Always friendly!! The portions are huge! And the prices are right! Don't go Sundays if you don't want a wait! Busssy!

The wait staff are a hoot and always ready for a laugh.  I appreciate the GM being out on the floor helping customers and delivering plates.  Some would just sit and watch.....

Love breakfast and I go here at least 2 times a month."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Went here with my gf and everything down to the sausage was disgusting and gross tasting. Hash-browns are extremely undercooked. Low quality foods,cooked like crap. This place used to be some other dump a way long time ago and I remember going there then even and throwing my food out and going across the street to mcdonalds."}
{"text":"I came here last Saturday with my boyfriend and was pleased! Walking in the restaurant they have a display of small deep dish pies and other sweets to tempt you. I'll give the banana cream pie a try the next time I visit.

I ordered the Hot Turkey Dinner and the portion was huge, considering it was only $8.99! The turkey was tender and drenched in gravy, if I get it again I'll ask for it on the side since the mash potatoes were drenched in gravy as well.

For good portions and a reasonable price, swing by Black Bear Diner!"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service . I had the mini volcano . Absolutely delicious . Highly recommend a visit !"}
{"text":"I ordered a Reuben sandwich. I ate a quarter of it which was really good and then I found a hair in my food. DISGUSTING. I almost barfed up my food. The manager came over offered to make something else for me. I couldn't even think of eating bc I was nauseated. He comped my meal and gave us dessert to take home. My husband had some last night and it didn't sit well with him either and he got sick. I used to work as a server for 3 years. I also know thay it is mandatory for kitchen staff to wear hair nets and facial hair nets. If this isn't enforced, then it needs to be. I get that it's out of your control that these things happen, but its gross. I dont think we will be back."}
{"text":"When to Black Bear Diner tonight for dinner me and my son I had the veggie omelette I ask for no mushrooms but extra spinach guess what I got little spinach and mushrooms the hash brown was swimming in oil. My son got pancakes,eggs and sausage. About a hour later my son was in the bathroom throwing up in a real bad case of diarrhea. I call and ask to speak to a manager her response was nobody else got sick. I didn't finish eating half my meal my gut told me something is wrong. Do not waste you money eating her. Will never go back. Calling the health department tomorrow to see if are food was tampered with."}
{"text":"This is the best spot for delicious breakfast. It is tasty, affordable, the plates are huge! The service at this location is excellent! Would come here every day if possible. Oh... make sure to try the Bear Claw, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is my go to breakfast just before leaving Vegas each time. Hearty meal in a relaxed friendly family environment at very reasonable prices. Coffee is good, my favorite is the corned beef hash."}
{"text":"Their pastas are amazing and so are their meat specials. Great, affordable place to take your family to (-:"}
{"text":"Walk into Black Bear, get a seat, and immediately order a huckleberry milkshake. Just trust me. Chicken Fried Steak is good, everything else is pretty good, too."}
{"text":"So wife and I enjoy the dinner in Arizona so we decided to go to the new location for lunch. Well the food was good. As for the service and the manners of the waiter that's another story. After looking through the menu the waiter asked us \"let's do this\"  
We both asked for water with lemon, that he did bring us. Never once asking if there was anything else we need or even coming back to the table. Once he brought the food out didn't ask if we needed anything else i.e. More napkins,water, etc. but he did a quick walk by and  blurted out water? I responded yes please, I had used the habanero sauce mouth was a little hot. Just then he ran out the front door to heckle some girls walking by the restaurant and even joked with another co worker about getting there phone numbers. Lunch was $22 and change. As we went to pay the cashier are server was standing by her side. We tipped him with cash and wow not even a thank you or hope you enjoyed your lunch or see you again. Absolutely nothing!! Strange thing about Vegas it's built on service,service and more service and word of mouth. I blame management for poor training and lack of supervision. I already told are family how poor the service was. We have watched a half a dozen restaurants in that location come and go this will be no different. 

Don't waste your time or money as there is a thousand restaurants to choose from and one on every corner in this town."}
{"text":"I have eaten at many Black Bear Diners and this is by far the best!  Great food and not full of grease. The service is superb too."}
{"text":"I met several old friends here on 2/1/15 for breakfast. Our food was good but we apparently overstayed our welcome.  The man at the front desk and a couple waitresses began to give us dirty looks.  I guess the figure they are busy enough that they can be rude to customers."}
{"text":"We ate at the Las Vegas Boulevard location for Sunday brunch. This place was crowded but they managed to move the guests efficiently.  Just wished there was more sitting space while you wait. My husband ordered The Scrambowl which is an all-in-one bowl of ham, bacon, linked sausages, eggs, bell peppers, onions, pickled jalapeño peppers and scrambled potatoes topped with cheddar cheese and country gravy. Served with biscuits. I ordered Cinnamon Roll French Toast (which is made of 3 slices of thick Cinnamon Rolls dipped in French Toast Batter) with sausages and eggs. Although next time, I'll just have the CRFT!  Both dishes were delicious and highly recommended!!! The price was good and portions are huge. Our server was good. However the place can be tidier and cleaner. Since it was so busy there are scraps on the floor and tables are not too tidy."}
{"text":"Great chicken fry! I like the thick cut hash browns and gigantic biscuit too. I could only eat 1/3 of my meal, but still enjoyed it. Atmosphere was cabin-like with bear stuff everywhere which was fun. I read about bad service from previous reviews, but our service was just fine and very attentive. Would go back if I was in this area."}
{"text":"Their salmon can't be beat!!  I enjoyed it yesterday with a great corn muffin (the old fashioned kind) and a terrific selection of veggies.  Yummy dinner and, as always too much food!"}
{"text":"Would have given 2 stars but the pie changed mind. The food is okay and they do have good coffee. Decent prices. I had the California Benedict which was good. Seems like the waitresses have a lot of drama going on between them and the hostess was no where near the mostest. Should definitely have a more sociable person greeting/checking out customers. She was pretty miserable. Nothing to rave about and most likely will not be back to eat in. **We may stop in and pick up a pie to go. We took one home and it was really good (we got the peach... Yum)."}
{"text":"First time I ate here and I love It, The Grizz breakfast is amazing. The server was nice and the ambient is quiet, I totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"Could be good, but if you can't handle the business lunch crowd in a timely manner, we won't be back.

Changed to a 2.  Restaurant is trashed. Tripping over old crayons.  Table is busted and wobbles at the top not the bottom.

Wait! It gets worse! The special ends at eleven, but the sign is still up! Good luck ordering the special that sounded so good when you read the sign the way in.

And don't visit the restroom until after you eat or you will lose your appetite!

But wait, the service is SLOW too!  

Better hope you get seated in the pleasant temperature room, not the freezing room.

Now waiting over 35 minutes since we got here and still no food."}
{"text":"Food was great. Super family friendly environment. A little slow as far as service and it was not super busy at the time. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for breakfast for the first time today. The food was absolutely delicious. The service was stellar. The biscuits were amazing. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in tonight to the black bear diner and I was pleasantly surprised.  It was clean and not too busy. The server came right away and once I explained we had never been there before she took her time to explain the menu, answer questions and offer suggestions.  She even accommodated my special requests for no extra chanrge. The food was awesome. So so Good. Would recommend the California omelette with hashbrowns. Delectable.  Will be back. Great breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Best pancakes ever!! And the staff is amazing. It does get crazy busy but they are super fast!! I love the pancakes for breakfast and any sandwich or the Chinese salad. Not a big fan of the country fried steak but my brother loves it."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast choices at a very reasonable price.  Eggs were cooked perfectly and the pancakes were some of the best I ever had!
Friendly staff bottomless coffee and tea...Super!"}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly; restaurant was clean.  Ordered waffle, french toast, and a scramble breakfast. First two were fine. The potatoes in the scramble were very undercooked and if not for the jalapenos the whole thing would have lacked much flavor. That is after I scraped off the gravy.  Scrambled eggs with a couple meats and vegetables - sounds good.  Lay it on fried potatoes - still got me. Put gravy on top - what? Yeah, gravy. Umm, no. Who thought that was a good idea? I take the blame because upon review of the menu, there it is. Overall,  pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Here's a solid diner. It's only pricy until you consider the monster portions you get as a result.

I came in with the want for a burger and a side of French fries. What I got was a giant burger and a full separate plate of French fries topped with cheese and an abundance of peppers. It was not only shocking, but delicious as well. The burger patty was cooked all the way through but still juicy, so no worries there.

The one comment I would have about service is that although they are nice, I believe they ask if you want extras but don't tell you that they cost extra. I got all of the extras and I paid a few more bucks for them, but in the end all of the mushrooms and peppers that got piled on my burger made it an even greater boss battle of goodness in my mouth.

I will be returning with the intentions of a meaty omelette, and as such I will leave another review. Until then, this is definitely a place to check out and return to."}
{"text":"Friendly yet slow service, got our order wrong, food was ok, big portions, but nothing I would really go out of my way for"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprise the first time I went here. I wasn't aware that it was a chain, just thought it was a local thing. The staff is usually friendly and on the ball. Only disliked one waitress, partly because it wasn't busy, her service was not only slow, but she sat me and my elderly mother right next to a party of about 20 who didn't seem to care that their 5 kids were running around, crawling under tables and bothering other diners. There was plenty of room on the other side of the restaurant and a seasoned waitress would have sat us away from this nightmare. 
The country fried steak is amazing. I am a creature of habit and once I find something I like, I stick with it. My only complaint and it sounds silly, but the portions are too big. With the steak they offer a half portion and that is so huge I can't imagine how big the full portion is. I suggested it and they said that there was a light menu, but that is basically diet food. I like the steak, just not one the size of my arm. They wonder why America has a weight issue, it's because people seem to want loads of food for cheap. I'd rather pay a fair price for an amazing normal portion of food."}
{"text":"Have been to this restaurant before, and it was good, however went there last night with several friends and the food was terrible, I had a patty melt & asked for well done it was very rare,  and bread and onions were burnt.  They said they would not charge me, but did anyway. Maybe they have a new cook, my friends did not like their meals either......"}
{"text":"I mean, referring to the 3 stars. It's breakfast nothing really stands out.  I can say it's friendly service cups are always filled and it's fast service."}
{"text":"Black Bear is a small chain dinner with great Southwest breakfast options.  I went here to kill time, it barely worked because the service was so fast!  I had the breakfast burrito and used their poppa bear hot sauce.  The burrito comes with jalapeno and is medium heat, the poppa bear sauce, sent it over the mountain.  This dinner is clean, homey and fresh."}
{"text":"First of all... our server Flower was awesome! She was extremely attentive and very sweet. But above all, she is very good at her job.
 I ordered the California Benedict minus the spinach. The Hollandsise sauce was the best I have had in a long time ( and I order Eggs Benedict every where) the home potatoes were great and the fresh fruit was fresh! My fiancé had the Denver Omelette and judging by how fast he inhaled it, i would have to say he enjoyed it as much I I enjoyed my breakfast. It was servered with an extremely large homemade biscuit, that we ended up taking back to California with us! They have their own hot sauces and my fiancé really liked the habanero one. He likes extremely hot sauces and said this one was really good and flavorful without being so hot that you can't enjoy what you are eating!
 Needless to say we will be back next time we are in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!! Especially the manager, Don! He's awesome! The food is delicious and the service is fantastic! We make sure to come here every time we're in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"This new location is decorated really neat, similar to the other ones. The food was good and so was the service. Everyone there was really friendly. I will definitely be going back here!"}
{"text":"I drove all around town looking for chicken pot pie and Google led me to this place.  I ordered to go and the girl at the register was very helpful in my choice of side.  Parmesan chips were delicious.  Cornbread was perfect but what I went in for, chicken pot pie,   was ok.  Not sure if it was the crust or the filling, but it fell short of my expectations.   I think I'll try the meatloaf next time and eat in.  The place has a calming ambience."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service! Everything I want for my breakfast! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Ordered well done hash browns with my breakfast. Food came. My hash browns undercooked and limp. I asked the server why. She said \"that's all we have right now\"! Really? Doesn't hash \"browns\", mean browned? FAIL! I see that the undercooked hash browns are mentioned in other Yelp reviews. So the undercooked hash browns are a common occurrence."}
{"text":"Meh about sums it up. Fresh squeezed OJ is $5 and $2.50 for coffee. Food was lukewarm when it arrived and the Harvest Grain pancakes were not thoroughly cooked. The bill was $10 more than our usual place we visit and I really expected more."}
{"text":"It's been a while & it sure was nice to be there!!  It's like walking in to a comfortable old friends house.  I got breakfast for dinner, because I could!  Comfortable seats and atmosphere.  Pleasant and helpful servers.  Delicious food!  What more can one ask for?  Great prices?  Yep, they've got those too!  So much food, I finished mine the next day.  Highly recommend to friends and family!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch brunch a little while ago. Good food and Great service!  Bring the family!  This location has a small selection of beer and wine."}
{"text":"What great food and friendly service.
I had the best bacon, cheese and tomato omelette ever today. Do yourself a favor when you are in Goodyear and enjoy a meal here."}
{"text":"I love this place. It was my 1st time Suzy was my waitress and she did a good job making sure i was happy. The food was great me and my husband ordered breakfast. The bacon was cooked to perfection and the eggs as well."}
{"text":"Arriving on a Sunday morning at 11 o'clock as a party of 5 is not the best way to try this restaurant for the first time. 40 minute wait outside. A suggestion to the management would be to get a bench for the outside area.
Ambience: very informal, very casual. Decorated in early \"bear\" - photographs of bears, stuffed bears, and sayings about bears decorate the walls all around the restaurant. Just about the right tone for a place to go for a family brunch.
Food: my wife and I shared a California omelet and the bear claw french toast. The California omelet add sauteed mushrooms, melted cheese, avocado, and other goodies folded into what appeared to be a 3 egg omelet. Fabulous!!! This had to be the best California omelette I've had in any breakfast place in a very long time. The bear claw french toast came with butter and syrup. It was stuffed with almond flavoring. Incredibly sweet. You certainly don't need the syrup on this one. A delicious second course to follow up the omelette.
Service: our server was very friendly and very welcoming. Unfortunately we got there during the Sunday morning rush and she was spread way too thin. Service was a little slower than I would have liked. However I was not in a rush and this did not significantly detract from the meal. I will definitely come back here again for a family brunch. An excellent meal at a very reasonable price. And very family friendly."}
{"text":"My first time to dine in this restaurant. It's a very busy restaurant. I got seated at the counter right away. The server assigned (Enat) talks to fast and sound likes she mumbling too. I could hardly understand what she was saying. I felt like I was rushed to make quick decision on what to order. I know they are so busy and working under pressure but that's not an excuse to not treating the paying customer properly. The food is not bad. I'm not sure If I will be revisiting this restaurant any time soon. One thing I loved about living in this city (Las Vegas) is the enormous number  of restaurants here. One restaurant taken off from my list is not a big loss."}
{"text":"Went there with the family for Christmas Dinner. Once we got seated, we didn't see a waiter of anyone for at least 15 minutes. When they finally brought the food, I ordered Turkey Special: TURKEY SLICED FROM A CAN OR SOMETHING, NO MASHED POTATOES, NO STUFFING. 

This is the second time I have eaten at this one. It must be a franchise because this diner is not anything like the one of Tropicana. I will not be back to this one."}
{"text":"Huge portions of delicous food and friendly waiters.  We often go for the Friday Fish Fry where you get unlimited Fish and Chips with amazing tartar sauce."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the whole valley. The service is wonderful, the food is great. The diner has a great homestyle feel and my family and I love to go as often as we can. The food has a home cooked quality that we always love. The milkshakes can't be missed, and breakfast is amazing."}
{"text":"One of the best services ever. Way better then Denny's when it comes to food quality. You literally \"Get what you pay for\" here. If you want some down to earth servers ask for Chris or Alexis. They're great people and excellent servers.

But when it comes down to it, this place makes it feel like if you're with family, and the good type of family. It damn near feels family ran as it would seem they only have one location, but they have many! 

Go here and I promise you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Simply the best breakfast! Delicious creamy pancakes, and the best eggs benedict I've ever had, California bacon benedict, with a side of fresh fruit and hashbrowns, and a fresh bottomless cup of coffee, yum! No matter how busy this place gets, we always get great, friendly and fast service! Have to still try their delicious looking personal pies and bread pudding."}
{"text":"I come here for the breakfast menu, it has always been excellent, how ever the couple times I ordered dinner, it was like eating in a senior citizen center. Stick to the breakfasts and you'll do just fine."}
{"text":"This place is a gem, an oasis in a desert of fast food sameness. Came in for breakfast today and had the Shasta Scramble with a side of bacon. Side of bacon in many places consists of two lonely little strips, not here: you get four thick cut slices, which is about what I'd eat if I were cooking for myself. 

Service for me was top notch, Brandon was fast, friendly and quick to refill my coffee. This is a diner, don't come looking for haute cuisine, triple decaf low foam cappuccino, or seasonal soufflés: it's a freaking diner!  You get good grub, at a good price, served by friendly, happy people"}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner recently. It was a local diner that offered various food items. And their menu was in a newspaper. A nice twist! Their chicken noodle soup came out hot and tasty with a nice piece of cornbread! My daughter had the pancakes, bacon and sausage. She enjoyed it. But was too busy eating my soup to finish her food.:) My husband had the ribeye, mashed potatoes and green beans. His comment was it could have come out hotter. Overall, I enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"I love the food here! They have everything from milkshakes to delicious french toast to burgers and steaks. They are one of the few places in town that give you a side of eggs and sausage with your french toast (most places charge extra). We have always had a great experience with the staff and they have fresh-squeezed orange juice. I love the wooden bear statues, but the restaurant has over a hundred dusty stuffed bears. Please get rid of the stuffed animals!"}
{"text":"The food is definitely comfort food. Large portions at just a great price. I had plenty of left overs for another yummy meal. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Place awesome food you got to check this out Laveen finally got a true true breakfast lunch dinner place this is all to me that menu is extensive you can't beat everything that they have on here between the beef tips tri-tips to country fried steak the breakfast menu and the big papa bear Burger which is awesome make sure you come down to try this place out"}
{"text":"For what this place is, its a winner compared to Denny's, Coco's, or other joints I'd put in the same category. Its fun for kids, with its Bear theme. I have had the fish fry and prime rib specials, both of which were really good! More than generous portions, this place will really fill you up! Avoid if you are on a diet! Great, friendly, attentive service too. The other location in Avondale is the same, just as good."}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner is THE place to go if you're feeling for some breakfast. Great service, great environment, great food: what more can you ask for? I love their foundation of the business and how it was founded. I have never encountered an \"just okay\" worker, they're all fantastic and sweet. The portions are huge. They cater to hungry people and not so hungry people! This place is particularly busy on Sundays so if you hate long lines, I suggest going on other days. Seriously you just have to try the food!"}
{"text":"Food was great, but our waitress, Casey, was the BEST! Truly never had service like that anywhere else. Will be back as much as possible!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat and a steal price wise!  When your sick of the strip rape and want to get a great meal and save some $$ for other things this is one of the places you want to go to.

We got the Grizz meal and it came with way too much food.

Only complaint is the bacon was too salty.

Minor thing: the biscuit is really dry... good for gravy but not for jam.

The pancakes are awesome, and filling.

Ham and Sausage were good, sausage was best I had in a week in Vegas.

Eggs were fine, we recommend you ask them to mix the cheese in if that's your thing.

Fresh OJ was very good.  Their coffee was good. 

Place can be very busy so plan ahead and deal with a little line.  Also pays to know what you want when the server comes to your table and lay it on them.  They are going to be pretty busy so they will not stop by a lot.  No biggie... just know what your in for."}
{"text":"Just ate diner this evening with my son and son in law. Staff was great and exceptionally nice. Food was good. We were there at a quiet time before the diner rush so we did not have to wait. I recommend and we will try for breakfast next."}
{"text":"I had horrible experience. I know they're new and all, but it's no excuse when you leave your guest sitting there for an hour without checking up on them and then they had to go talk to the manager to figure out that their order was \"lost.\" Seriously? That's ridiculous! They weren't even that busy when we were there. We ended up leaving on empty stomachs and it was a complete waste of time. First experience at Black Bear Diner and I'm NEVER coming back! Do yourself a favor and stay away!"}
{"text":"Good food! The place is ALWAYS busy. (Avoid on a Sunday if you can) Which is a good sign but, if they don't have their top notch server assigned to your table, get ready to need stuff and not have it.  Still, I would definately check this place out.  GREAT breakfast.  Country Fried Steak breakfast was wonderful.  Good crisp breading. Tender meat.  VERY tasty gravy."}
{"text":"My Baby Bear and I had been to the Black Bear Diner in Torrance CA a few months ago and we came across this one here in Vegas, I really wanted the taco salad but since it was too early I decided to get breakfast, I got the chicken fried steak and eggs, I was actually happy with my selection, the chicken was nice and tender, gravy was so full of flavor. My BF had the waffle and a side of bacon with a hot chocolate, the waffle was ok, the hot chocolate seemed watered down he had to add some sugar to it even though they served it to him in a sloppy cup which dripped all over the table he still enjoyed it, I personally didn't like the fact that they served him the cup like that with whipped cream running down the cup onto the table but thats just me, other than that the food was good, I do have to say the young lady I believe was the host needs a little clean up her self, her hair was sloppy and she looked like she didn't wanna be there, ok Im done."}
{"text":"Gone here a couple times for breakfast and it was always excellent. Except for one time we were seated in the back where there was hardly any people. It took a while for anybody to notice that we sat down. I have to say about 15-20 minutes before somebody asked us if anybody had helped us. We got our coffee 10 minutes later and we had already ordered so we waited another half an hour to get our food. When Our breakfast came to us it was cold. I mean stupid cold. We didn't say anything because we were heading to the game that day and needed to get out of there and didn't want to bother trying to have them warm it up for us."}
{"text":"pot roast was very good,,,,did not like the caned green beans...."}
{"text":"I was surprised by location . The food was fresh steaming hot and flavorful staff all over anything u needed. Managers were there for the staff . Great experience I didn't see coming they continue to make me happy I stop in. Great service fresh juice and great breakfast"}
{"text":"This is by far the best & most consistent breakfast spot in town. They offer fresh squeezed orange juice and their home fries are delicious! Red potatoes w/peppers & onions. (Potatoes are important as I'm allergic to wheat.) They're also very good about substitutions. I get fresh fruit instead of toast/biscuit/English muffin. And the fruit is actually fresh & delicious. That being said, if you're not allergic to wheat, GET THE BISCUIT!  The seedless blackberry jam on that huge house-made biscuit is TO DIE FOR. This is definitely NOT your typical Vegas breakfast joint. Indeed, so much better! They have a LOT of regular customers."}
{"text":"Don't come here expecting 5 star restaurant ... Servers are busy even when slow but they will get to you ... The people complaining dirtbags. Have eaten here many times and I'm patient and service is ALWAYS GOOD.

But I come here for the food! Home cooking, truck stop, 1980's.... Just GREAT!

Everything is good. It's a diner!"}
{"text":"We came in for dinner, it's 3 of us. Not too many people here at 6:30 pm but it's good, not a lot of noise. Jazmin greeted us very nice personality and sat us at a table. She even took our drink order. 

Our server's name was Jessica. A very nice personality. Very knowledgeable of the menu. She took our order and while we waited she stopped by and made small talk. Never seen that in a restaurant before.  

I falied to mention, do not come to a restaurant when you haven't eaten all day. It makes the choices very difficult.  The drinks were getting low and she made sure they were full. 

For the dining area to be thin it took an awful long for our food however, when we received it, Oh My God it was delicious.  I had The Volcano and it was huge. 

Long story short, we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"This is just down the street from us so we go here regularly. Its much better than dennys but similar prices. Cute decor inside and very friendly waitresses top off the expensive."}
{"text":"First time for me. Four in our party! 2 ordered fish and chips, 2 chicken noodle soup (soup of the day). I enjoyed the fish and chips; thin and crispy batter...the fries were excellent. Not sure if they fresh cut the fries (vs. frozen then fried)... One in our party said it was the best chicken noodle soup they've ever had (she is 93 y.o.). Couldn't say no, on the way out, to strawberry rhubarb pie!

Loved the creative interior setting! An escape from the desert setting (like Flagstaff/Alaska vibe)."}
{"text":"I think the food is ok, although I find it a bit greasy. My problem with this place is the temperature. It is always freezing cold no matter where you sit! I am not the only one who has the problem. I've seen many other customers shivering in the cold. Bring a sweater!"}
{"text":"We arrived, were given water and waited 20 minutes before we gave up and left.  Will not be returning here.  Unfortunate."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to have breakfast.  Great food and good people!  Love them!"}
{"text":"We went in here for a late dinner on Sunday night with a party of 9. ( 4 adults and 5 teenagers) 
We were seated with in 4 minutes and given our drinks with in 5 minutes.

Our food was very good. We have no complaints!  I highly recommend the Double Bacon Blast. It was so good! Huge portions and totally worth it! I ordered mine with Onion rings.

Our service was great and restaurant was clean. If I go back to Phoenix I will go back here again!"}
{"text":"Update January 2018, went there for dinner after having a not too pleasant lunch there when they first opened up. The waitstaff was still very good but what made the difference was the cooks were right on time with the order. I decided to order the Ribeye steak. Now I figured that most short order cook places were not very good with ribeye steak orders so that's why I decided to try this and see how good they were at getting my order correct. The steak came out exactly the way I want it and it was delicious. I couldn't eat it all so I decided to take it home. The next day it was just as moist and delicious even though it set overnight. I would say that this diner has finally come up to par after what disaster the opening months were like."}
{"text":"Another good morning at BIG Bear diner. Ordered the Grizz. Really good 2 sausage, 2 bacon, 3 eggs, ham and potatoes if that's not enough it came with 2 pancakes. Couldn't eat all the pancakes but the food was great. Heather was our server she was great and took good care of us."}
{"text":"Portions are BIG and the prices were very affordable!! The food was fantastic and the biscuits are a must!! Definitely a family friendly place with a great kids menu. Everyone was super friendly, so happy to have found this place!!"}
{"text":"Have been here many times over the years and its always a so-so experience. Today, the food was mostly delish and the service (finally) was mostly good, but here were the tradeoffs...first, when the hostess got our drinks, she brought me a LARGE fresh oj ($4.49) without even asking which size I wanted. I wouldnt have minded if a large wasnt so expensive, but having the choice should be expected.  Then we waited at least 10 minutes without any acknowledgement from a server until we grabbed another one who took over our table as a courtesy.  She brought our food out quickly but my hubby had ordered hash browns n she brought country potatoes instead. Also, the potatoes for both of us were undercooked.
Then when we paid the hostess asked how everything was & gave me a crazy look when i told her we had no server till we stole someone else's. Then she underpaid my change by a few cents, which seems pretty hard to do with a cash register doing math for you, and a drawer full of coins.  Probably not going back  there anytime soon!"}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place before finding it on Yelp, and the rating was dead accurate. Had a great experience, delicious food, relaxed atmosphere, and it felt like a genuine family-owned diner. Hector was our server and did an awesome job. Highly recommend to try!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service!!! Loved the atmosphere! Will definitely eat here again, farewell Waffle House!"}
{"text":"This conversation happens almost every night with my husband:

\"What do you want for dinner?\"

\"I don't know... what do you want?\"

\"I dunno, what do you want?\"

Gah..

Luckily, tonight, I responded with \"I want some good old fashioned home-cookn'!\" And he said, \"I know just the place.\" He showed told me about Black Bear Diner, and so I looked up their menu online.. A section of the menu was specifically named \"Good Old Fashioned Home-Cooking\". I laughed.. sounds like we picked the right spot. As my eyes scan over the online menu, I notice how everything was just down-right comfort food.. mmm!! Meat loaf, chicken-fried steak, hot soups...

Called and ordered to go- I got the Hot Turkey with mashed potatoes, steamed veggies, salad, and he got the Tri-Tip platter with mashed potatoes, steamed veggies and salad. And a chocolate mousse pie to end it all. Came to $31 and some change- but the portions were pretty big and we both ended up with left-overs and didn't have any room for pie.

I promise this is one place I need to try again."}
{"text":"I am on the fence about this one.  It really feels like a glorified Cracker Barrel that costs more.  The food is good.  But I think I am just  Cracker Barrel fan so the Bias kicks in.  I need a couple more visits. The service is good.  Nice atmosphere.  Not something I am jumping at going to anytime soon."}
{"text":"The Bear has great breakfast and a typical Diner environment. The food is very consistent every time I visit.  They keep it clean and the staff is usually very nice.  If you wanna get breakfast on the weekend get there early or your going to wait a little while for a table.  They don't have enough parking so you might end up parking at the hotel that shares the lot with the BB.  I go for breakfast mostly but I have had some good dinners there as well."}
{"text":"A good breakfast joint.  A cut above Denny's, and with a bit of humor that will make you smile."}
{"text":"Great amazing spot off the strip. Biscuits are huge! The place gets packed but its definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"The worst ever.  We have gone here before for dinner and the sandwiches were just luke warm.  Today after tip for 40.00 I am barely surviving horrible stomach cramps from this mornings breakfast.  Eggs Benedict with big chunks of red onion, hollandaise sauce that was see through...the portions  about 1/3 food then fill the plate up with potatoes.  My sons french toast , two pieces could fit in the palm of your hands........however........potatoes galore.  4.99 for warm fresh orange juice?  WARM  like it was tea.  We live in the area and frequented the Chilis that was there before.........."}
{"text":"My husband LOVES the cinnamon apple crumb dessert! We took an evening walk and he decided he wanted something sweet so we stopped in. All the desserts in the case looked yummy but he settled on that one! We couldn't walk home fast enough so he could dig in!!  Great job Black Bear Diner!!"}
{"text":"My grandmother and I went to breakfast this morning and we had the BEST SERVICE! 
Naomi was a fabulous hostess with a smile and professionalism that seems to be rare these days. Samm, our server, never missed a beat and took excellent care of us from the very beginning to the very end. Samm, also had a great smile and professionalism that was always present. 
I was extremely impressed by both today and had to share."}
{"text":"It's a classic rustic California diner. You definitely get transported to another era. I feel as if the black bears displayed throughout the diner are just going to come alive and attack everyone :-). It's a very homestyle place with friendly staff. They have your traditional American breakfast, lunch, and dinner items.  The breakfast potatoes are great along with their gargantuan country fried steak. I've also tried their malt milkshake, it's pretty amazing."}
{"text":"Very mediocre burger and chicken pot pie looked good but but tasted nothing special. The staff was attentive and the place is nice but the overall food quality and tastes don't let me to give this place more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"Here on business and found this place on Yelp.  Nice inside, with the inside of a cabin feel to it.  The music was way too loud for early Sunday morning.  We requested that it be turned down and it was.  We had the bear claw and it was more than enough to split between 2 people - yummy!  The breakfast that we ordered was slightly above average.  the wait staff was somewhat friendly - my wife and I made a game of bringing out the friendly side of our waitrress.  The cashier was very friendly and talkative - perhaps part of the ownership?"}
{"text":"We came for fathers day and had 20 in our party and Ray was so nice and polite, he is the definition of customer service. Then we sat down and had Mindy as our waitress...she is a ball and one of the nicest people I have ever met and very pleased to help you order and makes sure its correct. Lots on the menu, I like that they let you order breakfast lunch or dinner anytime.


Chicken fried steak was huge and tasty 
 This is a must try place. Oh yea the cinnamon rolls are huge!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight for the first time. Our server Kaylee was very sweet and kind. Service was efficient and food was delicious. Plates were generous portions and very well priced. It's not often we find a place where everyone in the family is satisfied and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been to Black Bear about a dozen times and here is my take.  I have found the food to be slightly above average and served by a competent staff on every visit I have made.  Anything I've ordered has always been tasty and well prepared.  I ordered the bacon deluxe burger today and it was great, although I have to admit that burger is way too big for the average human to consume.  The bacon they used on it was really flavorful and cooked to perfection.  Any time I've ordered any breakfast items they have been great as well.
The staff is friendly and do a professional job. The prices are about what I would expect from a diner/coffee house.
Overall they do a good job and serve good food."}
{"text":"My daughters took me to lunch today and as busy as they were our waiter Darian went out of his way to make sure that us and all his tables were well taken care of - the rest of the staff is really nice and friendly - My daughter has gone here before and raved about the food and service and I gotta say they have great food and great staff."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently visited family in the Tempe area. One Sunday morning, around 11:00am, we were out looking for a good brunch and came upon Black Bear Diner. Sunday was probably not the best day because it was extremely busy and we needed a quick meal before heading out for the afternoon. We saw seats at the counter and immediately sat down thinking it would be faster. It wasn't but I am not complaining. We watched a well-oiled machine, so to speak. We enjoyed brunch and a show! There was a man from the corporate office directing traffic while numerous orders were placed, cooked, and sent out to customers. The staff, from the corp guy to servers to runners, were extremely efficient and never lost their composure the whole time we watched. It was amazing. 

We ordered our meal after waiting awhile, but Susie was very friendly and kept an eye on us. She knew we were there, so we remained patient. In the meantime, she ran around like all the others doing a fantastic job in a difficult situation. Once we got our food, it was absolutely delicious! My husband ordered the Grizzly (I believe that was the name), which contained eggs, hash browns, an assortment of breakfast meats, and pancakes. I had a smaller breakfast of two scrambled eggs, two pieces of bacon, and two delicious pancakes. Unfortunately, we had to eat quickly due to time, but took our food with us. It was too good to waste!

A couple days later, we decided to go back around 10am and enjoy our food at a slower pace. We were immediately seated, brought drinks, and attended to by Collette, who was friendly and ready for us. We again ordered eggs, bacon, sausage, and pancakes - we loved the pancakes and wanted more! I asked for extra powdered sugar as I enjoy that on my pancakes more than syrup (they dust the top of the pancakes with it to begin with, which I love). I was brought a small container with plenty. The food again was hot, delicious, and worth the money! Prices are reasonable, but we probably would have paid more. We like the food that much.

We visit the area often and will return to Black Bear Diner. I cannot say enough how great this staff was on an extremely busy day and on a more laid back day. I have only had breakfast there and it was delicious. I imagine lunch and dinner would be good too. Our two experiences were enjoyable and our stomachs were happy and satisfied! Good job Susie, Collette, and all!"}
{"text":"I never liked pancakes until I ate here! Breakfast here is the absolute best in the area. The sausage is great, the homemade sweet cream pancakes are just amazing! I had the green chili pork Benedict and it was the best I've ever had. The wait on the weekends is so worth it! And they juice oranges in house for yummy orange juice! Definitely a must try!!!"}
{"text":"It's sad when a place with delicious breakfast \"served all day\" has to resort to serving stale breakfast for dinner. My husband works nights so it's hard to find breakfast at dinner time, but we were excited Black Bear Diner did because we love this place...in the morning. It was so obvious that nothing except the eggs were fresh. All of our meals came out literally in 5 minutes. The hash browns were the worst. Like biting into cardboard and didn't taste much different. The biscuits were so stale you couldn't even cut into them. They were as hard as rocks and just crumbled once you finally broke through the outer crust. We let the waitress know (which we never do), but we were starving and could only eat the eggs! She basically looked at us like, 'what am I supposed to do?' And then gave us $2 off of our bill. Though, of course I don't blame her. I am so disappointed...and hungry."}
{"text":"Love their food here, we come around once a month to eat at the front diner.. The three stars is simply for all the times we have seen the servers place the finishing food items on plates without any gloves. Just today we saw a large tray of ice cream orders and one girl trying to put the strawberries on with a spoon.. Apparently it wasn't fast enough because another server came over and started \"helping\" her by sticking them on with her bare hands.. I've seen this same thing with the cherries they put on top of their desserts too.. And no, not grabbing them by the stem. I'm sure this stuff happens elsewhere, but I'm a firm believer in gloves for all food handling. They just seem lazy here about it."}
{"text":"Has to be the best coffee in Vegas, strong stuff and they make their own sausage. Now this ole country boy knows his pork products and the sausage here is king. I was not going to stop at that so I had me some biscuits and gravy that bout had my tongue reach out my mouth and slap my mama. Bottom line, the Black Bear diner is good eatin."}
{"text":"Really has gone downhill. Booth tables all unlevel and seats with uneven cushioning. Server a little erratic with her friendliness, super friendly one moment and seemed pissed another. Long wait for food by diner standards. My \"southern scramble\" was horribly oversalted and the worst breakfast I've had in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"First time at black bear.  Food was good and our server was nice and efficient.  BUT.....the girl who seated us and the lady who processed our payment were robotic and unfriendly.  The talk like they reading a script.  No smiles l, no eye contact...just wanted to to do what they needed to do and move on.   Too bad."}
{"text":"Good home style food.  Large breakfast and never wrong. Biscuits  and gravy are perfection.Had the meatloaf for dinner. The right amount of moisture content, as I've had some places that are just dry.  The wait at sometimes can be a pain, but that's breakfast on the weekends for you."}
{"text":"When visiting Avondale for the first time with my best friend, I found this spot via Yelp (of course) and ultimately chose it because of its charm. 

DECOR/AMBIENCE: At first glance online and outside the building, the warm wood, southwestern color scheme, and of course, massive amount of black bear decor really made for a welcoming feel overall and helped me, a Chicagoan, feel like I was getting a real feel for the area. Plus, I really just love diners so much, no matter where I am.

FOOD: After taking a lil' looksie at the menu, I was pleased to find all of the breakfast and lunch classics diners usually carry: burgers, pancakes, BLTs... you know, the works! I got a waffle breakfast and a cup of black coffee, because I was being boring, and also because that's what I was in the mood for! Sue me!!!!

STAFF: Our waitress was helpful and not overbearing, and gladly allowed my friend and I to split the check, though I know that can be annoying sometimes. Apologies -- we'd just started our vacation and hadn't come up with a system yet! Thanks for being so patient with us.

CLEANLINESS: I'd like to point out that if you're not generally a diner person, you'll probably find this place kind of gross. I think my menu and coffee cup were both a little sticky... but to me, that's the charm of a diner. And it wasn't a dirty-sticky, it was a diner-sticky. I can't explain it. Frequent diner fans, you know what I'm talking about!

I enjoyed my visit here so much that I signed up for email updates, even though I live thousands of miles away. I really like this spot and would recommend it to people visiting the southwest, because I can see in other reviews here that it's a chain. I certainly hadn't seen a Black Bear Diner prior to my trip to Avondale!"}
{"text":"Being out of town visitors for a few days,we've eaten breakfast, lunch and dinner in this restaurant. The service was great every time, the food was really good and the servings extremely generous.  The \"little less\" tri-tip dinner was plenty of food and the tri-tip was done medium rare as requested.  This is one of our \"go to\" restaurants when we are in the area."}
{"text":"This diner is exceptional!  The chicken noodle soup was mouth-watering good and the Tri-Tip Dip was one of best beef sandwiches I've ever eaten!  Great wait staff and clean eating environment.  Highly recommend this establishment to anyone looking for a great meal in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is less than 1 mile away from where I live; I have no idea why it took me 5 years to walk into this place, but I'm really glad I did!!  

When you first walk in, it gives you warm, fuzzy feelings... Probably because there are hundreds of stuffed bears lining the top shelves of the walls!  I heart stuffed animals! But I digress... 

Anyway, I just want to say, this is one of those places where you can \"taste the love they put in their food\".  Every dish is fresh and tasty!  I don't know of any other diner-type establishments that I can say this about.  And I'm so glad I have a place like this right around the corner from me... I now have a \"diner\" that I love!

The only negative:  Since discovering this place, I have a difficult time maintaining my summer \"bikini body\".  Oh, chocolate cream pie and banana cream pie, how thoust torture me so!! *sigh*. Best/worst discoveries ever hahahha!  They even sell their own versions of hot sauces!  Try \"Mama Burn\" to add a little kick to your dishes! (I recommend it on the chicken flatbread for lunch!)

Please try this place.  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Went there this morning and our waitress was Kathy.  My husband ordered steak and eggs medium rare. Our order came and his steak was well done.  I noticed the girl at the other table had a long, thin steak and it was medium rare although she ordered well done. Both tables sent back the steaks (after our waitress confirmed our order as if we said it wrong) and moments later new steaks came out, only they were the same ones delivered to the correct tables, meaning my husband got the other girl's steak. As Kathy placed the steak down, she said the chefs cut into the side (over a 2 inch cut) to confirm the temp. My husband and I both looked at each other in shock!  This is a health code violation to place food on a table, then reserve it to someone else. Our waitress kept eyeing us because she knew we knew what she did and after she asked if anything was wrong, she argued that both steaks were in the window. We said we don't want it and she said I'll remake it. 

Needless to say, we are beyond shocked with the professionalism of our waitress and the level of service this place conducts. I would seriously think twice before going here ... You might get someone else's leftovers."}
{"text":"Very very large portion for salads and pretty much all the dishes. I would deff be coming back. Friendly staff and quick service!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have enjoyed eating at this restaurant and being a veteran was happy they gave us a military discount.   Last time we were at the restaurant we were very disappointed when were told only I would get the discount, not my wife. My wife has an ID, and deserves it being a support to a veteran.   All wives of military members are due all the respect we can give them!   Shame on The Black Bear Diner."}
{"text":"Excellent service, good coffee, clean place.  Had the sausage scramble, red potatoes were as were the biscuits.  Gravy was weak and the sausage lacked seasoning.  Otherwise not a bad breakfast, I would come back"}
{"text":"This is the worst place to have breakfast in .... its old and dirty . Plus HAIR was found in my food and the managers did nothing about it but ignore me . Maybe because I looked younger and they didn't care but no sense of respect to come and talk to an upset customer . This place is bad . Don't waste your time and money here ! Customer service is definitely not a priority here with the managers ! Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Delicious! Shaun Marie was our server and she was great!!! She was attentive,  funny and made us feel right at home. Our drinks never went empty. The food was delicious. The portions were large. Only problem now is Dennys and IHOP just aren't going to cut it anymore!!"}
{"text":"This has been a great breakfast place and been going for years. Looked forward to those outstanding pancakes and wasn't disappointed today. However, very dissapointed in the rest of thr plate. Had to send eggs and bacon back. Ordered over easy eggs that came out raw. Never seen an egg cooked like that. The bacon wasn't crispy and noticed others cutting the fat off the bacon as it wasn't cooked long enough. When the food was brought back., waitress scolded us that in the future to correct the order as this is the way they cook over easy. The bacon was tough and I could tell it had been dropped in a fryer to crisp it up. Oh so disappointed. In my 60 plus years I've sent back food twice, today being only the second time."}
{"text":"Great food very delicious and the prices are reasonable for the portions. Great customer service manager walks around making sure you are food and friendly staff"}
{"text":"While searching for a New Breakfast spot to hit up, Yelp came to the rescue! 

Came over on a Saturday Morning and there was a considerable line out the door. Hey, this place must be doing something right?! Waited 15 minutes and we were seated. Place was surrounded with Stuffed Animal Teddy Bears, like the ones I used to win at the Circus Circus! Haha, that was a long time ago.. like ancient history!  

What I ordered off the 'Black Bear Times\" Newspaper(Menu):

BIGFOOT Chicken-Fried Steak and Eggs: Goliath Sized Dish! The chicken fried steak with the sausage gravy was One of the Best I've had! Their strip-cut hash browns, crisp outside and soft inside, the Biscuits Plump, spread some butter and Gameover!! Not Quantity over Quality.. Quality with Quantity!

Homemade Corned Beef Hash and Eggs: Yes, shredded/chunks of real corned beef that was consumed in minutes! Too bad this wasn't loaded like the Bigfoot chicken.. dish! The country potatoes with the onions and pepper, soo good!

Sweet Cream Pancakes: Better than average, not that sweet and it didn't have the fluff that I prefer.


This Place Rocks!! A Great Way to Start Off Your Day!!"}
{"text":"Make sure when you stop by Black Bear Diner you bring a bear-like appetite! When you walk in you're greeted my big fluffy cuddly bears. Environment is very forest-like. Feels like you're dining in the woods of New England. The service is very fast, but a little too business like. Our server was Trey; he didn't really attempt to make it a fun experience but he was very fast! Since its breakfast lunch and dinner all day I decided to try the cinnamon bun french toast. First of all... WOW huge portions!! Time to cut out a few new notches on that belt! It was very good. Not too sweet. Could have used more cinnamon but very good otherwise! Give this place a visit! You won't regret it unless you over indulge with their HUGE portions :) 4 of 5"}
{"text":"Huge portions but food and service very good. Server Troy was very attentive, prompt, friendly and accurate.Eggs cooked exactly like ordered. Passed on the biscuit which is so large. Spicy sausage patties are awesome.
 Priced right and will go back."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, the employees friendly and helpful, the service is great...not really much more you can ask. The food has a genuine home cooked flavor."}
{"text":"Came with a crew of 17 people and had some fairly specific requests regarding meals, timing etc... and the Black Bear Diner was great. The food was fantastic and came out on time. Not a single complaint from the entire crew!"}
{"text":"My family and I stopped here after attending a movie, it was a little later in the evening, so the restaurant was a bit empty.

The waitress we had was very friendly and professional. 

The food was great and serving sizes were huge! Prices were very reasonable. My son ordered chocolate chip pancakes and got 3 huge pancakes. Normally, my son has no problem finishing a plate, but he actually brought half of them home. The rest of my party ordered pot roast, meatloaf, a cuban sandwich and a bowl of soup and 1/2 of sandwich. Everything was cooked well and tasted great.

They also make all of their own ketchup, hot sauce and steak sauce without high fructose corn syrup. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went with my daughter  Carrie and the twins,  Brendan and Connor for breakfast.  So good best biscuits and gravy ever.  Good  omlette. Kids ate their food !!!  Great service,  Jenna was our waitress she was awesome.  Over all great breakfast.  Want to go back now"}
{"text":"Loved the Black Bear!   I had the huevos rancheros made with pork carnitas - wonderful!   My husband had the hobo omelet which looked tasty but he said mine was better.   I picked redskin potatoes but wished I had chosen hash browns when I saw how good they were.

Black Bear will be on our list for our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"I fell in love with the place before I even ate.

Imagine if your grandmother (who loves stuffed bears but isn't creepy about it) opened a restaurant and it was awesome.

The entire restaurant is lined with stuff bears. Look up? There's a stuffed bear. Look on the wall? Stuffed bear. Look toward the bathroom? Stuffed bear. Besides stuffed bears, wood carving of bears appear both in and out of the restaurant. There's even a painting of bears playing poker! It's thus living up to it's name: Black Bear Diner (even if there are some non-black bears).

It's just one of the places that seem cool and inviting from the moment you step in. The restaurant looks 1/2 Grandmother decorated and 1/2 California Grand Adventure from Disneyland. If you like your surroundings to have a bit of warmth, you'll like it.

But it's a diner and not a museum piece so how does the food taste?

Awesome. That's how it tastes.

I found the place by searching \"Biscuits Gravy Las Vegas\". Several people mentioned this place as having some of THE best Biscuits and Gravy available. Being a former Southern girl, I'm very familiar with Biscuits and Gravy and they didn't disappoint.

Nice fluffy biscuits you can break apart easily. Creamy white gravy that wasn't too runny nor like paste (as I've seen at other restaurants). Great flavor too!

My only mistake was I ordered the spicy sausage patties. Don't get me wrong! They were good and done well. They were simply too spicy for me. Now that's rare as I'm used to very spicy food. Being from a Mexican and Cajun loving background, I'm no stranger to spicy food. Yet, the were really spicy and just a tad outside my tolerance. I could eat about 1 and 1/2 patties before I had to stop.

Next time, I'll get the regular patties. I can't fault them for it. They did ask if I wanted hot and spicy patties and they delivered. I'm the one that couldn't keep up. =)

My fiance had Eggs Benedict with a side of hashbrowns and fruit. Normally I see Hashbrowns that are grated into tiny slivers. Their hashbrowns were more thick which made for a better hashbrown. A nice thick outer shell with a softer (yet still well cooked) center. The fruit was fresh and didn't appear to have any signs of aging.

The service was just fine. I got my coffee filled fairly fast and the manager came by to make sure everything was alright. As a nice bonus, he was cheerful and sincere when he asked. He had that nice grandfather look when he asked instead of the deadpan question you sometimes get. \"Hello. Everything fine? (1000 yard stare) That's great... bye.\" Didn't get that there. Just a nice friendly question.

On a final note, the employees all have a smile on their face. They don't have that \"dead inside\" look, I've see at other places. Who wants to eat where the employees look miserable? I don't.

So if you're looking for an old style Mom and Pop type place (at least in feel since they do have several restaurants), give the Black Bear diner a try. It's my new favorite place."}
{"text":"Huge breakfast and delicious! So happy there is a great place to go for breakfast in South Chandler. Very clean! Great service! Beware. Their biscuits are huge!!!! One of their biscuits are equivalent to about 4 anywhere else! Sausage patties are homemade and amazing! Great waffles, too. I can't wait to come back and try their lunches and dinner."}
{"text":"New store.  We have been several times....good food and good service.  Huge portions.  Great value."}
{"text":"Went on a sunday morning around 10am so of course it was quite busy, the wait time was about 45-60 minutes but thats fine, thats what is expected for breakfast on the weekend. next time will try counter to shortcut or avoid any wait time since its usually just 2 of us.

Service was excellent, my cup of coffee never went low, waitress checked in on us frequently, and the food came out in just 15 minutes. Ordered the corned beef hash (not something i usually order but heard great things from others) and side of biscuits and gravy. Corned beef hash was just as i would imagine it to be, and the serving size of the biscuits and gravy was enormous. 

I made a couple subs to my order and the waitress knocked it out without any hesitation or upcharges. Also the food was pretty cheap IMO, for 2 ppl and 1 side the total with tax was only $22/23. awesome"}
{"text":"when i lived in california, we would travel 30 min. to hit up black bear diner.. it was a really popular spot that people would line up and wait for.

when we moved to vegas, we were stoked that there was a black bear diner that wasn't 30 minutes away... yet was totally all that the black bear diner at home was: AWESOME.

the portions are huge.. from the breakfasts to the lunch salads.. HUGE as a bear.  

i love love breakfast.. [it's my favorite food] me and my son  usually always order the grizz or i personally love the california omelette which is soooo good.  

another great from this place are the biscuits and gravy. duuude, so good.

my daughter loves their french toast and their taco salad which comes in a huge huge crispy taco bowl.  

husband loves the big foot which is a humongo chicken fried steak smothered in gravy. 

we love to come here on random weekends when we feel like a big ass breakfast for brunch... it's a good place to knock out two meals because of the portions.

still love this place, in cali or vegas..."}
{"text":"Delish everything was great, service, food and atmosphere! We found our new breakfast spot! Also portions were huge!"}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie...all those dusty bears staring at me while I ate breakfast were kind of creepy. But I can overlook that because of the food.

Fast, attentive service (especially considering how crowded it was), super-speedy coffee refills, great fresh-squeezed OJ and very reasonable breakfast options. Our table ordered a lot of dishes based on the recommendations made by fellow Yelpers, and you guys did not lead us astray. I had the bacon eggs benedict, but I promise you I am definitely getting the homemade corned beef hash next time. I was super jealous of my coworker who ordered it!

The bears reminded me of eating at my ancient Aunt's house, but let's be real: breakfast joints and diners in general are more about the food than the decor, right?"}
{"text":"Love the chicken fried steak! 
Love the big ass biscuits n gravy! 
Love the huevos rancheros with chorizo on a fried tortilla!!! Soooo good and so much flavor you gotta savor !!!
Service was friendly! 
Wish the eat at counter at this location was bigger only 3 seats. 
Orange Juice freshly squeezed!!! It's $5 but it's a treat that's naturally sweet and can't be beat ! Would make a heck of mimosa !!! Wish I had the juicing machine at home!! But that's why there's black bear. Flying Black Wolf has a huge crush on Black Bear! Huge portions that put Denny's and IHOP (INOT) to shame. Delicious good food at a fair price !!!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, large portions 
Love the atmosphere theme all about the black bear ."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast, even at 3pm! I highly recommend their hash browns. Tasty omelets and chicken fried steak as well. Friendly service! Homey atmosphere and adorable bear decor top off a good meal!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Breakfast served all day! The prices are good and the staff is friendly! It's nice to listen to the oldies while eating your food. Don't forget the chocolate cream pie when you check out."}
{"text":"My cousin and I ate breakfast here this morning. Trina is awesome! Food is always good here ."}
{"text":"Wonderful customer service, great food, great atmosphere. We never get tired of going here. The portions are so big, you always will leave here satisfied."}
{"text":"What puts this spot over the top for me is the decor. It's almost like something you'd find at Disneyworld. And that's so awesome in my book. The bear theme is most definitely very present here. So right off the bat, it's a fun and neat place to dine. Breakfast is the happening time here. Though, if you go during the week (as opposed to the weekend), there's no wait and it feels practically empty around breakfast time. The portions are large, but not crazily large. The chicken fried steak I had was seriously delicious. The waffle was also a total winner. The menu is lengthy and the options feel endless. So many choices! And that makes this spot even more of a crowd-pleaser - there's something for everyone. It's a classic diner type place. It's comfy, casual, and easy going. But the food quality is a major step up from other similar places around town. All in all, I'm definitely a fan."}
{"text":"Great job at this location. I came to them to celebrate my birthday and had a hearty breakfast. I have attached a picture. The waiter was great and the manager Robin is pleasant to speak with.  She helped me to pursue getting a fundraiser set up. I can not wait. Thanks everyone."}
{"text":"It's a bear themed restaurant is what it is. I've been in love with this chain for a while and come to this particular one whenever I'm near Vegas. Breakfast menu is grand, so is the dinner menu. I'm not too crazy about lunch menu, but they serve all 3 menu all day. It's a fun and friendly atmosphere, very family appropriate."}
{"text":"We've been to the Black Bear a couple of times for breakfast, which is excellent, but never had been for dinner (by the way, we always split the Griz for breakfast and always leave with leftovers...it's HUGE!) We decided to go to the Black Bear this past Valentine's Day to give their dinner a try. My husband had to work a bit late and we had our toddler with us so we were just looking for a nice family-friendly dinner. The wait was about 15 minutes but that was ok. They have a little jukebox in the waiting area and our daughter liked looking at that. When we were seated our waitress was very nice and helpful. We ordered a grilled cheese for our daughter with fries. It was a large portion for a kids meal and came with a free sunday (not a crummy, cheap, artificial ice cream sunday but a good one, with vanilla bean ice cream and your choice of topping). Of course I had to taste her sandwich and it was a really good grilled cheese! Nice bread and good cheese. The fries were excellent too; they were seasoned fries, not just frozen crinkle cut fries that you get at a lot of places. My husband and I split the small portion of chicken fried steak with green beans, potatoes, and a side salad. Even for a small portion it was plenty for us to share. The chicken fried steak was crisp (not too much breading) and the gravy was good. The potatoes were red-skinned mashed potatoes and you could tell they were homemade. The green beans were not spectacular but not bad either. The salad was crisp with fresh cherry tomatoes, red onions, and carrots. About halfway through dinner our daughter became very fussy so my husband had to take her outside for a little bit to calm her down. Our waitress was really sweet and came over to see if she was ok and asked if she could get me anything. I was surprised at how concerned she was! When we went to pay (you pay at the front register) we were pleasantly surprised to learn that kids eat free on Tuesdays! Nice surprise! We ended up paying around $15 with tip and tax for our dinner and our daughter's free dinner. Plus our daughter got a balloon when we left so she was excited about that. We will definitely be returning to this place again! It's a great place for breakfast but it's nice to know it's a good place for dinner too!"}
{"text":"This is your basic all-American diner. The decor is cute with wooden bears (duh) and wooden chairs and tables to give it a rustic/lodge look. But tbh, I came here for the food, not the decor. I got the ScramBowl which comes with a side of homemade biscuit and gravy. It's decent but nothing memorable. However, I did really like the gravy which is probably where all the calories are haha. 

One thing to note is that there are calorie counts beside each dish on the menu...which could be nice or not really because sometimes I just like to be oblivious to how much calories I'm ingesting. I appreciate the honesty though. 

Main reason for my 3 star rating is the service and the amount of time it took for the food to come out. I seriously think we waited close to 45 minutes for our food and it wasn't like they were that busy. The waitress would disappear on us and when she did magically appear again, we had to ask for refills on our water instead of her just doing it. She also dropped the check off without even saying anything so we sat there for a while thinking she would bring it to us. I finally looked around the table and saw she dropped it on top of the condiments...because that's where most people leave the bill? 

I don't think I'll be back. Maybe if I'm feeling for basic breakfast and mediocre service."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, especially the chicken fried steak, biscuits and cinnamon french toast. We mainly go for breakfast and it never disappoints. There are also locations in Las Vegas and northern California and they all delight the stomach and eyes!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another try. Coffee was way bitter. Over easy eggs were so runny.
Same rude Manager talking down to all his employees...i wont be back because of this. He may want to take a class. 
Three stars is for the pleasant waitress and delicious fresh fruit bowl..."}
{"text":"Wonderful friendly service, only thing missing was stretchy pants.. portion, portion galore.. 
Their gift shop is the biggest hit for me.. Lol
Got slippers, lunch bags, soft bears, oh yeah.. all those, Bear it.."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, and the portions are huge.  If I was only rating on the food, I would give them 5 stars.  Unfortunately, the service leaves something to be desired.  The service is extremely slow.  We had to wait 35 minutes between ordering and receiving our salads, and this was just the start.  I would give the service 0-1 stars, which is why I averaged it to a 3 star rating.  Plus, it took over 10 minutes to pay at the register, and we were first in line. We love eating at Black Bear Diner restaurants, and this was our first trip to this location.  We will not return to this location due to the service.  Instead, we will drive a little further to the Tropicana and Jones location which has great service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing!!!  The portions are HUGE and the food is delicious! The chicken fried steak is the best I've found in Las Vegas. Three of us in our group ate that.  The fourth had the waffle with chicken and said it was great.  The waffle was huge and had a paw print on it to go with the bear theme throughout the restaurant.  The two children ate from the kids menu and loved their dinners and their ice cream for dessert.  Smaller versions of the meals are available, and these are also large portions.  Diners are not charged an extra plate fee if they choose to share a meal.  To go boxes are readily available.  I would suggest getting a to go box and saving room for dessert.  We had the bread pudding, sugar bears lava cake, and the banana split cream pie.  All were delicious and HUGE portions that were perfect for sharing.  We discussed coming back with a large group and ordering one of every dessert just so we could taste each one.  The prices are very reasonable, the service is great, and the atmosphere is family oriented.  We will definitely be back!  It would be nice to see a Black Bear Diner open on the NW end of Las Vegas so we don't have to drive so far for fabulous food.  :)"}
{"text":"After the first time we went there, we decided we wanted to go back a second time in December since, Black Bear Diner isn't really built for the Phoenix summer. 

Unfortunately the second trip was just as disappointing as the first. 

I got something called \"The Volcano\" which is just eggs, pancakes, sausage and bacon (Not sure how that warrants the name \"volcano.\" ) 

The eggs were bland, as were the pancakes. The bacon and sausage was pretty good. Nothing special. The server was friendly. 

Black Bear Diner is really just a Denny's with a Bear/Mountain theme."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here and it was very good.  The sweet cream pancakes are huge.  I would give it more stars except for the fact that they serve tap water.  Not everyone drinks soft drinks, some of us just like water with our meals.  I'll bet the manager or owner of this place drinks bottled water at home, or at the very least, filtered water.  So why would you offer your customers - those paying the bills - tap water?  Las Vegas water is nasty.  Will it really dig too deep to provide decent drinking water?  I would have given five stars if it weren't for my husband having to get bottled water for us to drink."}
{"text":"Perfectly good service in a busy diner. They've got this customer service thing down. 

The quality of the food itself was a bit disappointing. I requested butter and whipped cream for my waffle, and discovered they only have butter \"alternative\" and synthetic whipped cream. It's a breakfast place with \"whipped cream\" on the menu quite a bit- they should get stuff that contains actual cream in my opinion. Fortunately, the waffle actually came from a fresh iron.

I ordered my eggs over medium, and they came out very runny and soft. I understand they are busy, but again, egg orders should be a strength of a breakfast diner.

I was happy with the service, and the price point. I'd likely actually stop here again when I'm in town, but I'd like to see some improvements to the authenticity of the ingredients."}
{"text":"I was going to write a three star review on this restaurant but Catherine's excellent service brought it up. First let me tell you what drove the star rating down.
   It is a cool day in Avondale and my wife and I didn't want to sit by the door in the table offered by the host.  He gave us a hard time and finally set us at a table that was still dirty from the previous occupants.
    Catherine was embarrassed that we had been set at a dirty table (the paper placemat was stuck to the table, no place setting) and she quickly remedied the situation.
    Once Catherine took over we had exceptional service and the meatloaf was excellent and it was served in a timely manner."}
{"text":"My first time going to any diner since last year and I have to say that I had a good experience at the Black Bear Diner. My coworkers and I had a break from work and one of my coworkers had actually ate at the Black Bear Diner before and suggested on having breakfast at this establishment. Great environment and cool how the menu is made from newspaper. Anyways I had The Grizz; 2 sweet cream pancakes, 3 eggs*, 2 slices of hickory smoked bacon, sausage links & a hickory smoked ham steak, I was not dissapointed, I will be going back to Black Bear Diner in the near future with my family and friends, thanks for the delicious breakfast."}
{"text":"The decor in this place is hilarious, like being in your hippie grandma's den. I've been here a handful of times with different people, it's usually busy but seating is prompt. The service is great and attentive, and I had one waitress that was exceptional. The best part about this place is the food. It's absolutely delicious! Definitely better than your usual diner fare. The portions are huge, so definitely share and try the sweet cream pancakes! I've had breakfast and lunch options and they were both amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing food excellent service Huge portions!
What else could you ask for, this place is my new favorite breakfast spot hands down."}
{"text":"So far, impressed with the level of customer service. I came in with a bunch of old school Belizeans...what that means is, they're annoying! Lol. Each step of the order process from the waters to the entrees had to be customized. The lady took it all in stride and with a smile. She was so accommodating. I asked for grilled salmon instead of grilled chicken with my pasta and they made it for me! 

They have cute newspaper style menus. Super cute. The prices are super reasonable. They start you off with corn bread muffins while you wait for your food. They were a bit dry. Like...af. But it's the thought. 

So the food came. And wow!!!! Like. GOT deeezang!!! At first bite....try at first LOVE! Omigod. So bomb. this food is fantastic."}
{"text":"I have are here twice and both times the food was pretty good. They are extremely heavy handed on the salt though. The service is okay. The breakfast food in my opinion is over priced compared to other diners of the same quality."}
{"text":"Even though my home is over 20 miles from this place, it's worth the trip for me. From the outside, it doesn't look like anything special. However, once inside, it has a northwoods cabin feel to it. Very warm and inviting. They also have free wi-fi, which is one of the reasons I go there.

The food is AWESOME. I just had the Bacon Cheeseburger Salad (yes, salad)... it's topped off with Thousand Island dressing. The portion was so big that I couldn't finish it. Their taco salad is even bigger. Come hungry and leave full.

My waiter, Roman, made sure that everything was top notch... as always, it was a great experience."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. I know a lot of people love the food here, but I haven't been overly impressed. I will say that I had a bite of the chicken and biscuits which was very good. It reminded me of something my mom made when I was a kid. Very comforting. I also share a few bites of the apple crumb pie with ice cream. It was served cold. It would have been much better heated up with the cold ice cream.  The pie was good but nothing to write home about. As for the type of food that I choose to eat, the choices were limited. I prefer a healthier lower fat/sugar type of diet. However, If comfort foods are your choice....this place will accommodate! 
As for the atmosphere, this location just opened yet it seemed somewhat dated. (Maybe because they used a prior Cocoa's location.)  It seemed clean. Somehow, for my liking, it needs something to excite it. 
It is perfect for those who like home cooked comfort food."}
{"text":"You won't leave hungry. Friendly service and large portions. I was glad that I tried Black Bear Diner.

Our server was super friendly. We enjoyed reading our newspaper style menu. I ordered the special: Prime Rib Scramble.

Our server recommended country potatoes. The Scramble was so so. It lacked seasoning. The veggies were under cooked in both the scramble and the country potatoes. The best part of the meal was the buttered sourdough toasts.

Other food at our table was the corned beef hash. It was a large portion of shredded brisket corned beef. The over easy eggs were good. Once again, the meat was under seasoned.

The chicken fried steak was stellar! Crispy and perfectly breaded. The white gravy was delicious! Over hard eggs were beautiful according to my daughter.

The bacon they served was thick and cooked well.

Black Bear Diner was oaky. I would like to come back for more Chicken fried steak. I want to try dessert especially the lava cake and pies. Did you know they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner all day?"}
{"text":"I will no longer be eating at Black Bear. I have been going there for about a year and a half and have really enjoyed it. I usually get an omelette and love the size and the price. They have an apple sausage that is excellent. 
    Unfortunately, the last three times I ordered my omelette it has been about half the size it used to be. I finally asked the waitress if this was intentional and she said it was. The corporate office has not only cut the size almost in half but they have also raised the price 70 cents. Now the omelette is extremely small and not worth ordering. After the last time I was there I ended up going home and eating something else because I was still very hungry. 
     I can go to places like Ronnies cafe and have a huge omelette and only have to pay about $9. U.S. Egg is more expensive but there omelette's are good sized and filled with things like roast beef or chicken and veggies so there's a good value for my money. 
    Cutting the size and raising the price is completely unacceptable to me so I will not be eating at Black Bear ever again. It is very sad when a restaurant makes changes like this and ruins things for there customers. I hope that Black Bear is reading this and takes note. Stop trying to rip off your customers, they WILL notice."}
{"text":"I have tried the Bear before for dinner and really liked it. The food was very good and the portions were large so that made me happy as well. Im going there right now to try the breakfast so I will give an update on how that went ASAP. 

And I hate to do this but, to Jessica H, a \"Bruin\" is a bear hence the spelling error. Im sure they did that on purpose. Get it? Black Bear Diner.....Bruin? Sorry I had to."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast!  We had Chicken Fried Steak and eggs w/country potatoes, and biscuit.  Portuguese Linguisa, eggs, and shredded hash browns.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"this restaurant is totally cute! came here with some family members from hawaii and they love it too! they have generous portions and the service was attentive but no where near annoying. i enjoyed the atmosphere here, a lot!

i will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went here, spur of the moment; Coming from CA. Our waitress was Tonya. She was over-booked on tables but assisted to our every need. We ordered the chicken-fried steak, with biscuits and gravy. It was AWESOME. Cheers to the cook! Tonya was gracious and helped us out with every request- Even though it seemed she was the only waitress working. She must've had 20 other tables, which is weird,  you think there would be more help....
Anyway. .. We sat at our table of 2, and watched this man cockily walk through the place, cursing, treating the servers like crap. We got uncomfortable with his presence, so we started to pay attention- Another guest told us that this guys the manager and is known to throw things on other occasions- He scolded the employees, made a scene, and yelled at his employees behind the counter,  (Yes,  we saw it ) and huffed around like a little boy who just got his toy taken from him. We asked to verify who he was and his name is Stuart, the manager. Tonya had to apologize for his non sense when we asked about it..;  She let us know that this wasn't common for Black Bear Diner. I would recommend this place,
BUT, whoever Stuart thinks he is, should be handled ASAP. That guy has some major power control issues. 
Staff is phenomenal and deserve the upmost respect."}
{"text":"Last night, I was hungry for some breakfast. I went to BBD and was greated by a very friendly staff. Taryn was my server, kept my iced tea glass full, helped me navigate a made-to-order dinner with prime rib with eggs, potatoes and a pancake. The food was very good, and the service was great. I had several people check on my dinner, my ice tea, and felt like I was well taken care of. My wife and I ate here on one of the first days it was open, and really enjoyed it. Last night helped seal the deal, this is one of our favorite little quirky, fun, good comfort food restaurants. BBD has many locations around the country, but I felt like they were very personable. Just a rebuttal to Ralph W., our first night, we had an issue with our gift card, and they gave us a very generous discount, even though they couldn't read our card. If something was wrong at this BBD, I believe this staff would have taken very strong steps to correct the problems."}
{"text":"I always seem to come here whenever I have the urge to have breakfast for dinner. The pancakes are light, sweeter than normal, and fluffy. They use sweet cream in there pancake batter and it makes the pancakes that much more delicious. They do a masterful job with there eggs and the country potatoes are good and plentiful."}
{"text":"The food was great  but the lady who served us is not good she did not even check our table if we need something or not instead l have to call her attention for twice for a refill of coffee she keeps ignoring us. Horrible service though"}
{"text":"Since the place itself was relatively new when I visited, I'll be fair with my review. The service was attentive, smooth, and helpful. The food is always excellent for the price. They serve you a meal fit for a lumberjack who has been away for a month in the northern wilderness. I mean, a lot! Clean, friendly, and overall quality food for the price. Would recommend. I prefer it over some other diners in the area."}
{"text":"Great play and great service.  I have never been disappointed at any Black Bear Diner.  We are here late for dessert only -can't resist the Huckleberry ice cream-only available here-a must stop for local and traveler alike.  I have eaten in quite a few Black Bear Diner's including the first and original location in Mt. Shasta.  I am always more than satisfied.  A not to be missed experience.  Stop into this location on South Las Vegas Blvd and say hi to Bobb, Brenda and Monique.  Prepare yourself for old fashioned hospitality and at home style cooking."}
{"text":"Very friendly servers ok food. Next time I will try breakfast and hope for a better outcome."}
{"text":"I'm thinking 'kitchy' would be a good word to describe Black Bear Diner. 

And in a good way...theme restaurant decor/atmosphere.  You guessed it...Black Bears!  Or at least bear paw prints on EVERYTHING!  And let's not forget the log cabin -like structure.  As someone else posted - it's like a place you'd find when you are vacationing in the mountains! And it all makes for a cute place to dine in.

Add to this, the PAPA bear-sized portions with Baby Bear prices...and you have a great place to eat!

Steak and Eggs for $7???!!!  Nice size steak with eggs the way you want it and your choice of hashbrowns or country potatoes. YUM!

Our favorite - a full stack of Sweet Cream Pancakes! 

And for dessert... pies or bear claw.

They need to open one here in Surprise!!!"}
{"text":"Huge portions but food was just ok. Biscuits and gravy were cold and water was good old tap water. Other than that food tastes good. But, I was shocked when I seen the bill. Nearly $5 bucks for a cup of OJ! The waitress nonchalantly asked would you like oj? We were like sure. When I got my bill I about fell over that 2 warm OJ's were $10. Not going back."}
{"text":"First time here and WOW.  The food was fresh, the portions huge, and the staff friendly and attentive. We will definitely be back. Please try the pineapple upside down pancakes...they will change your life!!!"}
{"text":"If you love breakfast and big portions, this is where you need to go. If you're feeling extra hungry, get the bigfoot! It's a huge country fried steak with eggs, potatoes, and biscuits. Last time I got the spinach and mushroom benedict. It was yummy! I'll probably get it again next time I visit. I usually get a side of their fresh corn bread muffins and smother it in butter. I seem to always look at their dessert menu when I'm almost done with my meal than realize that I'm way too stuffed to even have dessert lol. Their pies and cobblers look so good! I can't wait til the day I'm not overly full so I could try one of them out. The food is always on point and I always receive good service here."}
{"text":"The place is definitely busy. Great wait staff, attentive cheerful and patient. Had the pancakes, they seemed more like sweet biscuits. Unusually heavy. French Toast were really flat except for the edges. Kinda strange. Bacon was thick and good. Sausage links were good. Cooked our eggs perfectly. Potatoes were good as well. I loved the coffee. Biscuits and gravy was HUGE. But not so tasty. Gravy tasted like flour, too much flour. Better ambiance than IHOP but IHOP honestly has better food. Decent place for breakfast if you don't really have anywhere else to go or don't want to drive farther. Place is clean and staff is great. Just food is Meh. 3 stars for everything but the food if that makes sense. Good addition to Laveen. Just wish the food was a little better. Potential..."}
{"text":"(this review is from last week's visit) - 
The restaurant was busy, we were seated within a few minutes. We went to this place for breakfast after work. Our food came out fast, server was attentive, and we paid a decent price for our meal. We will be returning the next time we're out this way."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food, service, portions are huge. U can share one entree with a friend or two. Sometimes it's a bit noisy on holidays & dinner time. But other than that it's perfect.  :)"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in town. The sweet cream pancakes are amazing.  We have been coming back each week since our first visit.  Good service and excellent food."}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner is one of the best places to go for breakfast, Lunch or Dinner, they give you huge portions no matter what you order and there biscuits are AWSOME freshly baked and add some blackberry jam to them yummmy, The service there is awsome and the place is always so clean, we have been eating there for years and will continue on for years to come.
Great place to eat."}
{"text":"This is a great local breakfast spot for the family.. if you go here ask for john. He's was great fast and funny. The chicken and waffles we're delicious. ."}
{"text":"Black Bear diner is our families favorite in the valley!  Great service, delicious HIGH QUALITY food at great price.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  Their orange juice is freshly squeezed and their hearty pancakes are very filling (and filled with bacon)!"}
{"text":"Came here early Sunday morning for breakfast and wasn't too crowded yet before the NASCAR race.  I got their special which came with a lot of food but modified it a little.  I had the pumpkin pancakes, 3 eggs, Portuguese sausage, bacon and hashbrowns.  OMG.... soooooooooooooo good!!!!  Definitely coming back here for breakfast before a race."}
{"text":"Me and my girls came here on our way out of Vegas yesterday for breakfast.  Had no idea there was one out there.  Wait was about 15-20 minutes.  Our waitress and everyone was very attentive and pleasant.  Everyone enjoyed their food!  And Don (the manager) was awesome!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"SALAD ..... had a GREAT salad with AMAZING gluten free honey Dijon dressing and it was wonderful!!! Others at our table got pancakes that looked so good, I about had a coronary.  And great coffee and LOVE LOVE LOVE the coffee mugs!!!!! NICE NICE staff too! \"My new favorite place!\""}
{"text":"Food was great! Atmosphere was retro diner style and very cozy. Service was very good. Loved the pies"}
{"text":"So even though this place is a chain restaurant, this review is specifically for this location. First off, their menu is HUGE but I always order the same thing when I go to this place: Country Fried Steak. It's their most popular breakfast dish and the gravy is oh so good. You can't go wrong with the Eggs Benedict either. Their hollandaise is sublime. When it comes to breakfast I prefer the hash browns over the fried potatoes. Portions at this place are massive. The decor is pretty casual, I like all the bears sitting up by the ceiling....so cute!"}
{"text":"I want to start out by saying, I  have been a customer for years. I started going to this establishment back when it was Perkins restaurant. I have been there probably fifty times since its conception. Great food, great portions, great price. I have never had a problem with there food, staff or cleanliness until the last two visits. About three weeks ago my wife and I came in to eat like usual, service was great. Upon completing our meal, which was mediocre at best, a roach decided to join us for dinner, as he walked across our table. The waitress was beyond embarrassed as she went to the front. The manager, Alfredo, was extremely arrogant, and presented the \"I don't give a shit\" attitude and literally offered nothing but an half ass apology. As we left we could bear this awesome manager yelling at his staff for trying to help us. We waited a few weeks and went back last night to give it another shot. They ran out of the fish fry at six o clock, the food we got was substandard. And we could hear the manager, Alfredo again, belittling his staff in front of us, again. We are not out for compensation at all. If something is offered, we generally will decline. But it shows the establishment values their customers. This is no longer the case with the north valley Black Bear diner. And my wife and I will not be coming back again. You lost a 20+ year customer."}
{"text":"I went for a breakfast meeting and ordered sides, the potatoes were delicious, server was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This is a chain breakfast joint full of big, huge even, comfort style breakfast plates. Enormous omeletes, pancakes, scrambles etc.
Inexpensive too.
The coffee is typical greasy spoon selection so if you're into java like me don't have high expectations.
They serve lunch/dinner too but come for breakfast."}
{"text":"Traditional classic breakfast menu with lots of options. Top hearty meals to try are the corn beef hash, classic Benedict, and chicken fried steak. And there are bears everywhere! From your plate, napkin, ketchup bottle, sugar packet, cups, etc."}
{"text":"I was there this morning leaving Las Vegas. I parked and approached the door. Upon opening it I was greeted by many people waiting in the waiting area. I wasn't in the mood to wait so I quickly left. as I halfway down the walkway the manager came out called to me and asked how many in my party? He explained to me that he saw me come in and leave and knew what I was thinking. Turned out the people waiting were a party of eight. The manager found
 a nice booth just for me. He felt my pain and went out of his way to help me out. I will make sure to make this my breakfast stop in Las Vegas from now on. 
By the way the food was great too."}
{"text":"This restaurant recently opened in my neck of the woods so we came to check it out. It was me, my boyfriend and my grandma. We arrived around 11:30 and there was a 5-10 minute wait. In reality our wait ended up being closer to 20 minutes because they had no open tables. They kept seating parties of 2 but didn't have anything for a party of 3. It was no big deal, we were patient. But by the time we were seated I was starving and ready to eat. 

Our server was a friendly dude, I don't remember his name. He introduced himself, told us the special of the day, and brought us drinks right away. We browsed the menu for a bit and then put in our order. 45 minutes later, we still had no food. I started seeing people that came in after us get their food. Our server made notice of this and went to check on our order. The kitchen has a big open window so you can see what's going on and I saw him and other employees scrambling about. I think they probably forgot our order. Now I was mad. 8 months pregnant and hungry, does not a patient diner make. Right away a manager stopped by to explain that some tickets had gotten messed up. He apologized and said he would take care of us. 5 minutes later our food came out, delivered by our server who was extremely apologetic. 

I ordered the sausage patty breakfast which came with two pork patty's, 2 eggs, hashbrowns and a biscuit. I thought the food was good, but nothing stand out or amazing. Obviously I didn't order anything special so it was standard breakfast fare.The biscuit was freaking huge, it was the size of my head! And I didn't like it. It's way too much bread and it was very bland. You can sub the biscuit for toast which is what I would do next time. My grandma ordered the Joe hobo omelet which had sausage, bacon, ham, cheese and spinach, and she said it was very good. She even had leftovers which is unusual for her. My boyfriend had the Bigfoot chicken fried steak, which was a hearty meal but just okay as well. After we were done eating, the general manager stopped by our table and apologized again for the mess up and told us our meal was on the house, as it should have been. 

I appreciated the staff for rectifying a bad situation and that has possibly swayed my opinion on this place. Not that I am in any hurry to come back, but I think I will give them another chance."}
{"text":"They do breakfast and pies best. Plentiful and good. Dinner items are just OK. Nothing special rather bland actually. Breakfast served all day. Definitely their strong point."}
{"text":"Great All-American cuisine with hearty helpings at fair prices. Reminds me of a lodge at Big Bear, Lake Arrowhead or Mt. Charleston. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"It is nice to know that there is a place that serves great and delicious food at a reasonable price and that it is family oriented also the staff is very friendly and welcoming they are people that you would like to have at your house just to say.  Plus to top it off  they serve coconut cream pie for dessert hallelujah."}
{"text":"I love LOVE Black Bear Diner!  When my boyfriend used to live on the West side, this was a regular breakfast spot for us.  Amazing food and good service.  Portions are more than enough, the quality is always high, and ingredients always taste fresh.  Highly recommend the pancakes or the chicken fried steak!  Heck - just order the Big Bear plate!  Might seem a little divey, but don't let the outside deceive you.  Perfect little breakfast joint and not a huge chain (which I will always try to avoid).  I'm happy to support Black Bear Diner any day of the week!"}
{"text":"I had great expectations due to reviews. The food was excellent! Portion size for the first time in life I needed a carry out!  Service was SUB PAR! I waited too long to meet my server and get drinks and refills. I was missing a whole portion of my order. The service left much to be desired. In their defense, it seemed crowded and I think they were unprepared. I'm in Vegas for 9 days to bury my father. I was looking for a\"go to\" place while in town. I don't know if I would go back. If the service was better they would have gotten 5stars, the food was just that good."}
{"text":"Went to the location on Sahara on yesterday, wasn't pleased. Found this one in Henderson. AWESOME!! The food, service, people were AWESOME! Smiles and greetings upon entering. Drinks came fast and food faster. Very good food! I'm 6'5 330lbs.-IM STUFFED ON ONE SERVING! I will be back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Sat here for an hour and nothing was brought over no food it is completely empty.  All we got was drinks Susie was amazing and very sorry but management never even came over to the table to apologize"}
{"text":"This place is pretty solid! They have a big menu with great prices and bottomless coffee is always a plus. The atmosphere is fun and the wait staff is also super friendly. 

ALSO, I've had my fair share of bacon and this place has some of the best. It's thick and crispy and everything you would hope for in a piece of bacon."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast!!! Huge portions!!! Everything we had was good!!! Chicken fried steak and omelettes were amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Woo Hoo our first time here and brought Mom as she was visiting  and sure glad we did! Joanna our waitress was WONDERFUL! Although the restaurant was crazy busy, she was attentive and brought everything to our table quickly and exactly what we asked for  The food was served on huge platters and we were happy and full when we left.  Everything was amazing and tasted incredible.  My husband and I ordered the Chorizo Scramble and again it was the perfect meal.  There's so much on the menu we look forward to coming back and having Joanna be our waitress! Thank You Joanna, you're the best!"}
{"text":"Went here specifically to try their peach cobbler, after reading reviews, but was disappointed.  The peach cobbler would have been delicious had it been HOT and BUBBLY!  Both times our server brought it to me cold, but not from the ice cream! She tried to make an excuse that they had a new convection oven and they weren't sure how to operate it!  Sorry but that person ought to be fired or taught how to use it!"}
{"text":"I wanted to be blown away buy this place & unfortunately was not. My son & I came in for Sunday night dinner at his request. I think he was excited about the thought of a free sundae after his meal, but I'm always up for something new. 
He wanted mac & cheese, they were out. I wanted the apple crisp dessert, they were out. The meat loaf had carrots in it, which I'd never seen before. His cheeseburger looked absolutely plastic, but he seemed to enjoy it. 
The cornbread muffin was wonderful! To top it all off, the peach cobbler, was served cold. Everything during this meal was fine, not great, not good, just fine."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try Black Bear Diner for quite some time, the opportunity finally presented itself on Saturday afternoon, so I took advantage. 

I strolled in on an early Saturday afternoon, with small children and a teenager in tow. My boys immediately took a liking to all the bear decor, Black Bear Diner is truly living up to its name. 

The hostess immediately greeted us and we were seated right away. The bus person came out, took our drink orders and let us know the server would be with us shortly. Meanwhile we were waiting, we had plenty of time to look over the menu, by the time our server appeared, we all knew what to order. Our server was friendly but a bit stand-offish, she wouldn't make eye contact. 

Items Ordered:

-Tri-Tip Dip Sandwich
-Chocolate Cream Pie

Our food came out about 10 minutes after placing our order, so it came out quick! I ordered my sandwich with mushrooms and Swiss cheese. The meat was tender but it had no flavor, it was very bland. It came with a side of au jus so that made it a little bit better. They don't skimp on fries here. Everyone's plate had an abundance of fries, the seasoning they use made them taste great. Now, onto dessert, the chocolate cream pie was amazing! It was really rich and creamy, it was the best part of the meal. It came topped with a lot of whipped cream and chocolate chips, the bottom layer of the crust is chocolate. Since we came in after 11 a.m., my boys received a free sundae with their meal.

Overall, I would return but next time I would try something else on the menu since I wasn't a fan of the tri-tip dip sandwich. Food is decent, service is good but our server could have been a little bit more attentive. As we were leaving, our boys were given a balloon each by the hostess, I thought that was a nice gesture for the small patrons."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and keep going another 100 yards to Waffle House or across the street to IHOP. Avoid this place unless you like rude staff and long waits. We checked in here with 3 small kids at 11:15 for a late breakfast and was told it would be 25-35 minutes. It was crowded so we sat in our car. Checked back in 20 minutes and our name had already been crossed off the list. The guy said they'd seat us next. After another 25 minutes of waiting and seeing several other parties seated in front of us, I asked when we'd be seated. The black lady running the stand was very rude and  said she'd get to me in a bit. I tried to explain that we'd been waiting for over 45 minutes and were supposed to have been seated a while ago, but she interrupted me and snapped that she'd seat us in a bit. We sat for another 5 minutes and she sat two more parties in front of us. I again approached and asked if we were being seated next, and she again snapped at me that she'd get us in a bit. I don't appreciate rude people. We left and went across the parking lot to Waffle House. We waited 5 minutes and had a great breakfast. We won't be giving any business to Cranky Bear diner any more."}
{"text":"My first time at this restaurant but most certainly will not be my last!  Before I try the food I rate the service and let me tell you the manager Sheree and server Melissa were the very best! Oh and the food was delicious! We hope to see them again on our next trip!"}
{"text":"COCONUT CREAM PIE. Absolutely amazing! I am addicted. I order it a lot and it's Absolutely perfect each and every time. And it's definitely big enough for at least two people to share."}
{"text":"*Technically my 2nd visit*
Just as tasty as my first visit, the only difference was there was a 15 minute wait for a table, and we didn't savagely consume a chocolate pie this time either. We didn't mind though, to savagely consume The Grizz with my partner was honestly worth the wait. The ambiance is enough to satisfy really, but feasting on The Grizz really was a treat! Their sweet cakes are SO GOOD and \"click\" with the rest of the meal, since there are 3 different meats on your plate with your choice of hash-browns or country potatoes+eggs. Perfect sharing size in my opinion, those sweet cakes are filling!"}
{"text":"Service was great, wait time was short, food was fabulous!  Especially the hash browns, best I've ever had!!!"}
{"text":"This place was such a disappointment. The only redeeming quality is the decor. The staff are inexperienced. The management is worse. The food was inconsistent and not at all like advertised! Don't waste your time!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever. Their plates are huge! you can easily share a plate. My husband and I usually split the California Benedict and get a side of pancakes. Anytime we have company stay over we take them to Black Bear Diner. No muss no fuss just great food and great service! There is usually a wait especially on the weekends so be prepared to wait for at least 30 minutes for an average party of 4-5."}
{"text":"Worst service ever we were a group of five no one was in the Restaurant they didn't sit us down for 45 minutes the food wasn't good either I won't bring my family there ever again!"}
{"text":"This location has only been open a week, so they're still working out some kinks. I noticed the servers rushing around apologizing for things find wrong and trying to make them right. 

The pies in the case looked fresh and amazing but I didn't try one.

I had the hot turkey sandwich. The turkey was dry and nothing in the plate was particularly warm. I asked for some extra gravy which was hot when it arrived.

Apart from that, it's typical of a Black Bear Diner."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Great prices. Yummy."}
{"text":"The entree I had at The Black Bear Diner in Las Vegas was one of the worst I've ever had, but the way our server handled it was so unexpectedly nice that I had to write.
 I ordered the Rustic Ravioli because it looked good in the menu. When it showed up on the table it was watery and just tasted like italian seasoned beef. I felt like an idiot because I should have known better than to order pasta at a place like this! C'mon, Black Bear Diner is for breakfast-all-day, burgers, and excessive amounts of french fries! It was a foolish mistake on my part, so I didn't send it back. I ate the bread that came with it and picked apart a few ravioli. My sister let me have some of her yummy breakfast foods that she was sensible enough to order. We decided that when the waitress came back we'd order some blackberry pie.
   The waitress (I wish I'd caught her name! She was really tall with light hair, probably in her 40s) came back to check on us and noticed I had barely picked at my watery ravioli.  She asked if it was okay and I think my discomfort with complaining showed on my face. I told her that I knew better than to order pasta here and that I was done with it. She murmured something placating and took it away. When she came back with our pie she let us know that she'd taken the offending ravioli off our bill and that the pie was on the house. 
   This great service turned a \"Ugh, let's forget this ever happened\" experience into a feeling that someone really cares about customer satisfaction. Good save, guys!
Needless to say, the pie was AMAZING. Skip the pasta and get that!"}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast as they are so generous with the portions that satisfy our basketball players' hearty appetites. Consistently good service from nice servers."}
{"text":"The day manager today was soo nice to me and my friend definitely can make your lunch experience that much better you can tell he loves his job and greets everyone that walks through the door as if they are all friends to him I love it!  Thank you again!"}
{"text":"Food is great like always for the place that is really full in the morning they try to get the food as fast as they can. The only problem is that the men's restroom is not as clean it needs like a deep clean it has a strong smell."}
{"text":"We have been curious about this place since we moved here almost four years ago.  We finally decided to try it a few months back when some family was visiting from back East and wanted to try something they don't have a home.  Now, I feel like I've cheated myself for having waited so long to try this place.  There were 5 of us for breakfast on a Saturday morning, and there were people waiting outside it was so packed.  We were quoted 40 minutes to be seated, and it was more like 20.  The service was wonderful, our server was polite, informative, and accommodating.  We each ordered a different breakfast, and every single one was delicious.  We loved it so much, we came back for dinner the next night!  The portions are large, the prices are fair, and the service can't be beaten.  Love, love, love this place."}
{"text":"I'm updating this review because we did not have the most pleasant experience. The service was excellent but the food on the other hand was okay... My husband ordered the California eggs Benedict, I ordered the corn beef hash with poached eggs and my son ordered the griz. We all ordered the hashbrowns crispy, now that usually means a little more crispy than soft... My husbands and my sons hash browns came out burnt to a crisp! It was awful! And my husbands eggs were slightly overcooked. My poached eggs were more like barely cooked eggs, they were pretty much inedible unless I'm trying to drink my eggs like I'm in a rocky movie... Lol it was bad. The manager and waitress were very attentive and fixed everything in a hurry and even gave us a free pie and 10 percent off of our bill. 
Service- 5 starts
Food- 2-3
We will be going to the black bear in good year from now on because both their service and food is always spot on."}
{"text":"One of my friends took me and my bf here for my b-day breakfast just before I left Arizona, we got there around 10:20ish or so (Saturday) and it was pretty packed...they told us it would be a 10-15 minutes wait...but perhaps either I was really hungry or it was more like 20-30 minute wait....

When we went in we saw many empty tables...so I'm not sure why they made us wait so long...and other people were still waiting outside when we were seated...and there was clearly a few good open tables. Now our waitress was a sweet old lady though...I overheard her trying to help a customer warm up their food because they were gone for a long time and the food was sitting there for awhile...the waitress insisted on warming it up for her and I thought that was really nice. 

I couldn't decide rather to get the Chicken Fried Steak with Eggs or the Homemade Corn Beef Hash with Eggs...since they both sound so yummy when you're starving...hehe So my bf ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and I ordered the Corn Beef Hash. I can't say I was a big fan of how they made the Corn Beef Hash...it was lots of potatoes with kinda too little of the actual Corn Beef......I ate a lot of the Chicken Fried Steak though..now that's a really good dish to order. My friend ordered their steak...and it looked pretty juicy and tender to me. My scramble eggs was a bit overcooked too. 

Overall I like the service, the menu was pretty unique....at first we just thought it was a newspaper but if you opened it up, you would have seen the menu inside..lol the food was okay....I liked the Chicken Fried Steak but do not suggest the Corn Beef Hash because it came with either hashbrown or country potatoes...and since I forgot Corn Beef Hash came with potatoes and not just the corn beef itself....I got double loads of potatoes...=/ So perhaps next time if I get Corn Beef Hash...ask for a substitute side instead of country potatoes or hashbrown..

The food was kinda pricey for breakfast though...it was about $50($6 tip included) for the three of us..."}
{"text":"I've seen Black Bear Diner multiple times on Yelp and have been curious about it. Finally last night my craving for a breakfast dinner took me there for the first time. 

The atmosphere is cute and rustic. They were fairly busy and we waited about 20 minutes to be seated, but I did notice a lot of empty tables & booths despite a lot of people waiting to be seated. I'm not sure if they were under staffed so not able to seat the empty tables. 

Now the food. Three meals were ordered:

The Mini Volcano: I am not a pancake person but after reading reviews and tips I saw many raving over the pancakes. They were delicious. Light and fluffy and very much worth getting. The bacon was thick and crispy... Probably my favorite on the plate. The scrambled eggs a little dry and over cooked. I also ordered a side of one biscuit and gravy... It was huge! A meal in itself. The biscuits are big and fluffy, the gravy good but nothing special. 

The Huevos Rancheros Benedict: I didn't get to taste this one but the comments back were that it was delicious. The pork had good green chilie flavor and wasn't overly liquidy like it can be sometimes. The red potatoes tasted fresh and homemade. 

The chicken fried steak dinner: The chicken fried steak was tasty and tender, but the mixed vegetables and cottage cheese on the side were just average. 

No one had room for dessert. 

Overall it was a tasty meal. I'll definitely go back for breakfast. The portions are large. You will definitely leave with a full tummy."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing. Ice cold sausage. Uncooked potatoes. Limp bacon. Burnt ham. Have been looking forward to eating here for some time but its a bit of a drive from our house. The sausage was literally cold like it had been in a cooler and maybe not microwaved long enough. But then are they really heating up cold sausage in a microwave? Just confused how it could be that cold. Im giving 3 stars because service and atmosphere were good. My hubby said it should be a 2 star. I guess Im the nicer one. Not sure we will ever go back."}
{"text":"This definitely isn't the best place to go to if you're a vegan/vegetarian but the server made us feel right at home. 

I love the atmosphere of the place ~ made me and my boyfriend feel like we'd landed right in the middle of Colorado or Minnesota. 

It's surrounded by plush bears and a decent upbeat mood. 

The service was great - my boyfriend enjoyed his pancakes, and I got the usual salad. 

I'd say more than anything the service was the best part of the whole experience."}
{"text":"Saw a Facebook Post from www.vegaseater.com listing 31 best breakfast spots in Vegas. Being that I take my Dad to breakfast on Sundays, I thought I would try to make my way through the list. 


https://vegas.eater.com/maps/best-las-vegas-breakfast-restaurants

We got there around 10:30 AM. The place was super busy, but we were seated right away. The decor was black bear everything! Wherever you looked, you saw bears. 

I ordered a half order of biscuits and gravy with bacon on the side. Dad had poached eggs with toast and a side of Portuguese Linguica Sausage.
The sausage was SO GOOD! 

A girl named Summer was our server. She was really nice and quick. She did t big us too much and we never felt abandoned. 

I will definitely Italy go back to Black Bear Diner. There are 5 locations in Nevada. We went to the Henderson location.

Check out www.blackbeardiner.com to gander the menu."}
{"text":"Love Black Bear Diner!  I haven't found a location I haven't enjoyed!  The food is plentiful and delicious, and the waitstaff are friendly and fairly quick, even when crowded.  Breakfast is delish all the time, with their tasty pancakes, large, fluffy biscuits, and a nice selection of omelettes. 

So tonight I went with my wife for dinner for a change: she wanted breakfast, while I was going for the dinner menu.  It's  a good time to go, as they are far less busy than for breakfast or brunch.  Looking for something lighter, I ordered the Pecan-encrusted trout, which comes with veggies and fruit.  I also got a side salad.  Of everything, the trout was the star.  Nice and moist, with a light coating of pecan and other flavors, it was perfectly cooked.  Not surprisingly, we found out at checkout that it is brought in from another supplier--they don't make it in house.  Regardless, it is definitely worth getting, and the manager (?) said it is one of their most popular dishes.  I'm assuming he means for dinner.

If there is one downside to Black Bear, it is that it is so popular that there can be a big wait to get a table in the morning, especially on weekends.  So be prepared..."}
{"text":"I don't care for this spot. The service is iffy and the food is hit or miss. If you come, breakfast is the best of the meals they offer. Breakfast served all day unlike most other breakfast spots in town."}
{"text":"Food great!  Bear claws awesome. Servers not all that friendly. Man at the cash register was super nice!  I would go back. Oh chicken fried steak great!!"}
{"text":"Delicious salads, my personal favorite is the taco salad with bacon ranch. Service was great, waiter was consistent with refills and had a nice attitude. Family friendly diner."}
{"text":"Our server Candy was top notch! The food? Pretty darn tasty! Chicken Fried Steak one of the top 3 in my life...  And that's my go to breakfast item...  Hash browns perfect! Blueberry pancakes...  The best I've had...  And I hate pancakes...  Will I come back? You betcha!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for a while and it did not disappoint. Shaun - Marie provided great help when ordering for this group of first timers. The food was hot and flavorful and delicious. Had 3 desserts for our table of 5, brownie, lava cake and banana cream pie. Oh. My. Gawd! Coming here again and trying breakfast next time."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and the food was great! The servers were so kind. I got the breakfast burrito and it was very good, had a nice kick to it. I also tried my brother's sweet cream pancake and it was so fluffy! Overall, great place for families and great food."}
{"text":"We stopped in after a shopping trip at ikea and my son had been wanting to try it because of the commercials. The food was really good. The chocolate pancakes were amazing. I deducted stars because our waiter. My mom asked a question about the pot pie and he gave her a unnecessary smart ass answer. Also I get some restaurants like to be clean but was it really necessary to vacuum while we were eating."}
{"text":"Black bear is good for breakfast but the worst for lunch we went there and ordered a patty melt it came out half done and it was not a patty melt we ordered cream of spinach soup we got cream of broccoli the taste was terrible they're good for breakfast but not for lunch"}
{"text":"Went to Mr. Mama's and got terrible service! So we Yelped this place and it was 100x better service. Food was good and service was top notch. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"My family and I come here for breakfast a lot and it's always delicious! There's normally a wait but they get you in pretty quickly and the service is good. I always get the country fried steak and it's amazing! However I came for dinner for the first time last night and it was really disappointing. Although it was empty the service was not as good as it normally is, and my dinner was honestly disgusting. I got the tritip and it was the worst I've ever had!! It had a really gross taste to it almost like it  was old and was really rubbery and chewy, I took one bite and couldn't eat anymore. I cook tritip all the time and have never had one as bad as this. And the vegetables were really undercooked and hard. Maybe I just came on a bad night i don't know. But I definitely recommend their breakfast!"}
{"text":"Went there today for Lunch, our first time. My husband was really craving a Hot Turkey Open Face Sandwich.Since the reviews were so good we decided to try it. Wow I don't get it! Is it just because the portions are huge? I'm sorry but the food was not good. His Turkey tasted like it had been injected with some flavoring, bad. The bread was tough like it had been microwaved.  I had the Gobbler, same weird turkey. Fries were bland and soggy. If you like flavor and good food and not just a lot of it, this place isn't for you."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots! Big portions for the price. The environment inside is cool, they have their signature black bears everywhere! I personally enjoy the eggs Benedict's and my boyfriend gets an omelette. This is definately a diner style type of resturaunt that carrys the essentials, don't expect nothing fancy."}
{"text":"In the search for great breakfast places, especially ones that serve it all day, this place just went to number ONE on the charts!   The service here is great, friendly, efficient, and fun with the bear-oriented t-shirts and paw-prints on their suspenders.  A lot of paw-themed stuff....from the dishes to napkins and stuff on the walls.

OK, now to the food.  As others have said, portions were quite generous.  Sometimes bigger is not better--but here everything was great.   I ordered fresh squeezed orange juice.  The large size was really LARGE.  Was it really fresh-squeezed?   I saw a Minute Maid machine near the kitchen, so I don't know, but it tasted fresh squeezed!  ordered the California Omelete with home fries and biscuit.  When it came out, I was amazed--the biscuit was the size of my fist!   But it was delicious, and moist enough to even eat plain.  The omelet came with jack cheese and fresh sliced mushrooms inside, with a couple of slices of avocado on top.  It looked and tasted great!  

The home fries were outstanding.  Many places serve up potatoes fairly plain.  These were red potatoes well-seasoned with salt and pepper plus pieces of green and red pepper.  Very flavorful and great looking.

My wife got their blueberry pancakes. I had a taste--they were flavorful, fluffy, and had a nice vanilla taste to them.  The ham stake accompanying it was a nice big slab and plenty thick.

This place is great for brunch, as you will surely be well-satisfied for several hours!

The rest of the menu looks good for dinner and lunch--plenty of comfort food with creativity and flavor!"}
{"text":"Ate here this weekend and it was so delicious. I will definitely be going back. I ordered the Volcano and it came with three pancakes, two eggs, two sausage and two bacon. The food was not greasy like other places in the area that have good reviews, but no so good food. The prices were great for all of the food we got. Definitely will be back sometime!"}
{"text":"My spouse and I went to The Black Bear Diner last night at about 9:12pm. There were 8 people waiting to pay at the register and the cashier told us to wait. There were plenty of empty tables and two waitresses chatting. We waited 5 minutes.  Food acquires a bad taste when your first impression is so poor. We left. Went across the street to the IHOP where service was excellent and the food was comparable."}
{"text":"The very first place we went to in Vegas, even before registering into the hotel. I sat on the front bench to get acclimated to the surroundings, after all, I had driven all the way here from San Jose. My parents were next door to the Filipino restaurant with her childhood classmates. I was not about to join them, knowing they would be chatting about the good old days. It was either an El Salvadorean place that sold Pupusas or the Black Bear Diner. Since I've already been through my eating pupusas phase, I decided to eat here since I've never been to the one in my area (Milpitas). I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak because I've never had it before. I got a salad with ranch because Caesar dressing was not available. It was very good, but because I drove all the way from Northern California, I was still full from breakfast 2 hours earlier. I wish I would have finished it, but I ended up taking it to the hotel but didn't eat the rest because we didn't have a microwave oven in the room. It was a nice place with a very extensive menu and very attentive servers. At least I know there is one nearby if I ever decide to go there again."}
{"text":"I've only been here for dinner but the food is great, and it isn't stated but you can order anything off the menu at any time. Great addition and VERY reasonable prices. Friendly staff and great atmosphere! A new favorite, I only wish there was a location closer to me!"}
{"text":"Service was ok but not impressed with the food. I've had better breakfast at dennys. The side of fruit had old mushy strawberries and the hash browns were way over cooked.  Nice bear theme but they need to serve fresh food this is the second time."}
{"text":"We were driving around and didn't want to go to a casino for dinner and found this diner on Urban spoon with a \"Best Restaurant 2013\"! I was shocked!  The chicken fried steak was frozen and raw tasting, the baked potato had been kept warm too long and was horrible, the chowder was warm and lacked clams, the mash potatoes were watery!   This was the worst food I have had in a long time!  Our server was excellent but the one  at the register was on her cell phone and another very loud one was taking pictures of some family members in for dinner.   Definitely would not go there and I do not recommend it for anybody who likes good food!   1 star is 1 too many!"}
{"text":"I lived in Las vegas for about 6 months now and I have finally found my new diner. Nothing can beat black bear. Food is delicious workers are friendly and the portions are meant for a giant. Thank you Marlene for the excellent service."}
{"text":"I was so excited when this restaurant opened and go at least once a week.  But the mgmt at this restaurant has went down every time I go and service just gets worse and I must not be the only one because it is less people at restaurant now and it is very sad!  Want be going back now - I went in on Friday and restaurant was half empty and was 9 am. They had one person working the register, takeout and sitting people - I waited 15 minutes and the lady just kept checking people out and not seating anymore!  So just left! And others walked out.  Horrible mgmt!  Want recommend it or go back!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food! My mom and I shared a delicious breakfast plate and left full. Their plates are generous portions which makes sharing even that much better. 

Sandor was our server and Diego was I believe the other server/assistant to our table and they were both excellent. Thanks for taking good care of my family. 

They serve breakfast/lunch/dinner all day everyday. Super cute bear paws everywhere, with newspapers as their menu. Just a sweet place to come and enjoy some good food."}
{"text":"Slowest service I've ever encountered anywhere. Took 40 min to get our food . Food was just OK.. Not great. They ran out of soup and baked potatoes and after waiting 40 min they got my order wrong. Manager comp'd my bill . Not sure what all the hype it about this place. Kinda disappointing really"}
{"text":"Wow, everytime I come to this place I am always full and happy when I leave. I can tell all of you that if you want to eat a large and really good (maybe not healthy) breakfast this is the place to go. Probably the best food and best price based on how much you get in the east valley. I have had several business meeting at this location. I also have taken my wife and kids here. So it is good for business and pleasure. I would recommend eating here. All of the staff are very friendly and attentative. I will say just to all of you in a super hurry when you want to leave that you can expect a line to checkout but please be patient this place does not deserve a bad mark because your to busy to enjoy life. Keep up the great work I will be back soon."}
{"text":"A chicken-fried steak as big as your head.

That's a very cool thing. I got it in a breakfast platter, slathered with gravy and including three eggs, a massive portion of hash browns and two of the biggest biscuits I've seen in my life. My cardiologist will be happy. It was one of the better CF steaks I've had since leaving the Great State of Texas.

The lovely bride got the southern something-or-other -- eggs, sausage and gravy over a biscuit. She proclaimed the gravy \"fabulous\" and she's picky as hell about gravy.

Had to drop a star though because once we ordered, the wait for food was absolutely *insane* -- pushing 45 minutes. Our server was a nice enough guy, but we had to flag him down for drinks a couple of times. If you're going to make me wait forever for food, at least keep me caffeinated and hydrated. A \"sorry for the delay\" would have been nice too, and at least made the wait more tolerable.

Good food (at least what we had, other things looked good too), and breakfast is served all day -- a huge plus. But if you go (and I'll go back), don't be surprised to have an interminable delay in getting your food. if they can fix this, we'll have ourselves a real winner folks."}
{"text":"Waited on immediately and served drinks fast.  Our waitress was very accomodating and professional?"}
{"text":"When I heard that Black Bear Diner was opening up down here in my native hometown, I was excited to check out and see what all the buzz was about. I've seen many commercials of the diner when I lived in N. California. Gave 3 stars because I wasn't extremely satisfied with the food, it was average. Came here for dinner with my father, he thoroughly enjoyed it! We have yet to make it back there for breakfast. The ambiance  I do prefer but something about the lighting was a little off that night. It was too dark and hard to see our food."}
{"text":"The woman who sat us, the manager (had dark hair) seemed very hostile and unhappy to begin with. The restaurant had tons of empty booths but she decided to seat us next to the kitchen and register. I felt there was a lack of privacy in that area, seeing as the register was directly behind my boyfriend's head. The noise from the kitchen was very distracting to our conversation, not to mention the sugar ants running around the table. I ordered a drink which they forgot to bring out. Then my waitress, Cheri?, made me feel as if she was very rushy with wanting to take our order, just for the food to take its time coming out.  Throughout the meal we had to constantly get our waitress' attention for refills, that is when we actually saw her, as she kept disappearing for long amounts of time. The food was okay but not good enough to keep me wanting to come back with that kind of service."}
{"text":"I read reviews on this place in the past and have heard the breakfast here is great.  After coming here I can agree the breakfast is indeed great.  If Denny's had a richer and higher class relative this is it in terms of food quality.  The atmosphere is very \"homely\" and comfortable.  This is a good spot to also take the kiddos with the various bear designs and stuffed animals on the wall.  I was a bit thrown off when the hostess gave me a newspaper designed to look like an old read.  When I opened it, it was the menu to the place.  There are a lot options to eat.  I was hankering for a steak and eggs meal.  My server, a cute little flower named \"Flower\" was very friendly.  She gave me the heads up for two options with steak and eggs.  There was a New York steak version (10 oz) and a Rib Eye steak (more expensive).  I decided on the New York steak with over easy eggs, a biscuit, and country potatoes.  The meal itself was rich in portion size.  The chef gets the compliments for seasoning the steak perfectly and cooking it to the medium level I was asking for.  It was juicy and fantastic.  Everything else that came with the steak was also very very good.  I was so full after eating here I had to go run a few miles at the hotel gym to not feel like a sloth.  The service and food here was great.  I'd come back for another trek.  This is a few miles off the strip so you are gonna need to drive, Uber, or taxi it."}
{"text":"So originally my review was going to have a few more stars but took some away and you can read to see why.

So originally was really excited to try this place. Had seen a lot of the pictures of the breakfast food and read some reviews. We were enjoying football Sunday and New Year's Day so we weren't in the mood to cook and thought it would be the perfect time to try this place.

Ordered over the phone, got a fit and focused veggie delite omelette with no mushroom. 

Husband ordered corned beef hash breakfast 

He went to pick it up, they showed him both things and the girl even read everything back and everything sounded correct, she even mentioned the no mushrooms . Husband saw no mushrooms on the omelette as well. We timed it perfectly so that husband got back right after halftime and when I went to take first bite it was filled with mushroom, tried to take them out but it was just a mess after that. 

Called them to complain , they were super busy which is understandable . I remember the manager asking if they showed it to us. Like yes but we didn't have a fork to open up the food and check inside . 

He asked what register it was rung up on and how we paid and said there might be two charges shown due to the fact that he would be doing a charge back or something for the cost of the food without the veggie omelette .  However nothing showed up. We were never comped . And the day of we didn't have them remake it because my husband didn't want to leave again during the game to go get it ... and they were so busy I don't think they wanted to remake it anyways. 

My husband and I shared his and mine was thrown away and we were both left unsatisfied. 

A manager lying and saying he will pull a receipt and refund you and not doing so, leaves a bad taste , on top of getting a simple order wrong ."}

{"text":"this is a great place for a meal. if you order breakfast, opt for the biscuits. they are huge and coupled with the rest of the meal, will definitely fill you up. be ready to wait in line though. this place is obviously no secret. the prices are a little high but the food is great and the people are friendly."}
{"text":"The first time we were here our waitress was grumpy. We weren't greeted she just asked us what we wanted to drink. When I asked about the side dishes she let out a sigh and rambled them off quickly, obviously annoyed with me for asking. I asked for flavored creamer which I never got. We also had to ask for coffee refills. I have the turkey club sandwich which was good, my husband had a bacon omelette which also was good. We decided to try again. The second time was worse. We waited about 15 mins to be seated, not a big deal for us. This time we had a waiter who also did not greet us just asked what we wanted to drink. He brought our coffee and this time I did get my flavored creamer. We did have to ask for a second coffee refill. We had to ask for our third coffee refill and we still hadn't received our food. Both refills were from other servers in our area, as our server would never come around close enough. My husband decided to ask the female server who refilled our third cup of coffee what was happening with our food. We saw three other tables seated after us already eating their food. She disappeared to the kitchen, 7 mins later, our server comes to tell us our food will be out in 5 mins. Ten mins later our food arrives. We had already been sitting down for 48 mins. I ordered the California avocado sandwich, which only had a smear of avocado and onion rings. My husband ordered the bacon sandwich, it barely had any bacon on it. Both our food was cold. We had to ask for our check because no one come back to ask how our food was or if we needed anything else. At the register I complained to the girl. I told her how disappointed we were with the food and horrible service for the second time now, and how we had been totally ignored the entire time we were there. She just said sorry and told me to have a good day. She really didn't care just like everyone else who works at that restaurant. I'll never go back and I'll be sure to tell everyone about both of our horrible experiences."}
{"text":"Way to step up to the plate Bobb! I'm very mindful of customer care and service , to be honest he saved my experience as a customer . Originally I was being assisted by Tina however I felt ignored and disregarded as a customer. We had to ask for refills almost everytime and when asking for extra butter were told no problem and she'd be right back but never returned . Bob was frequently passing by and noticed our cups were low and asked if he could assist . He gave us excellent service with personality even though it wasn't his table . I left a tip and wrote please give it to Bobb I hope they do so as deserved it . Wasn't planning on returning or tipping but Bobb made me want to come back to see him . EXCELLENT JOB NOTICING A CUSTOMERS NEEDS"}
{"text":"This place is really good have been here a few times really enjoy there food  never have have any complaints except I'm always to full when I leave here they give you a ton of food for your buck . I moved here from Boise Idaho and was so happy to find they had a black bear diner here thank you for the great food."}
{"text":"I went to Black Bear with my boyfriend recently, wanting a change from usual breakfast fare. The portions were huge and the food delicious! We both cleared our plates and plan to go back soon. Prices were reasonable considering the portion size and service was terrific!"}
{"text":"5:30pm Walked in was nervous cause the parking lot was empty. Seen reviews and went in. Sat down asked for strawberry lemonade. She went and made one from scratched in a old milk shake machine. That was awesome very smart. The burger was good I ordered medium and it was medium. The tri tip dip sandwich wasn't the greatest but wasn't the worst thing. The burger was so good made that seem not good. Frys could of been done a little more. Onion rings. Servers had a great attitude. We left an hr later and the place was getting busy parking lot full. 
Thank you next time I'll try desert."}
{"text":"I went to the Black Bear located on Sahara.   The staff was very nice!  The food was okay.  I ordered the chicken fried steak.  My biscuit was dry.   The place is decorated nice.   Okay Food nothing to  write home to mom."}
{"text":"\"This is the best club sandwich I've ever had!\" Says my bf. The food was very fresh and tasty. I had the California benedict: perfectly poached eggs, thick cut bacon crisp, and perfect hash browns. They did forget the avocado, but were very nice about checking the menu to be sure, and then bringing it on the side. 

What brought me from 5 stars to 4 was the service. The first server we had said hello, brought us drinks and then disappeared. Like, she never came back! The next server we got was friendly, cheerful, and attentive, but after eating, we waited for our check for what seemed an extra long time."}
{"text":"My sister and I went for the Fish on a Friday after having a bad experience somewhere else, and the Fish was awesome, really got fish and a little breading, very flaky, service was very good and we will be back!"}

{"text":"Pancakes are amazing, bacon is delicious, hollandaise sauce tasted like pre-made egg drop soup. Will definitely be coming back in the near future."}
{"text":"Having driven past this Black Bear diner a million times, I finally had the opportunity to stop in for breakfast. Pretty standard diner fare, with large portions, strong coffee, and brisk service. Previous reviews are correct- the coffee is pretty strong! Not undrinkable, but it definitely packs a punch.

I had the combo meal, which came with your choice of pancakes, French toast, or a waffle (I chose pancakes), eggs, and your choice of meat (I chose smoked sausage). The portions were definitely hearty! I really enjoyed the pancakes, they were filling, yet not too dense, and I intentionally only ate one, so I could have the other later. The sausage wasn't my favorite, but I couldn't figure out why. Eggs were fine and cooked to order.

Our server was pleasant and made sure to come around often to top off our coffee. We ended up with an extra glass of water, strangely, but no complaints. He did seem eager to get us out of there, which I didn't understand- the restaurant was busy for a Wednesday morning, but there was no wait.

Anyway, an overall fine experience at Black Bear Diner! If you're in the area and hungry, it's a good choice."}
{"text":"It's a diner.... food is good, though nothing \"special\".... tasty, just not fine dining.... until  you get to dessert!! four words: cinnamon apple cream pie!!! don't hesitate, just thank me later!! this is hands down one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten!!!! I want to roll around in this!!! I want to smear it all over my face! it's so amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Stolen money $800. Dont eat here. Thieves."}
{"text":"Yummy and cheap hot food cooked well. I had the pancakes, and they were buttery and sweet, without the butter or syrup. My bf ordered the steak and it was good  not chewy or over cooked  
The service was impeccable and the prices aren't bad. The only thing was, is our glasses werent always full. That's a huge deal to me."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere. Great food and ample portions. Great salad and chicken fried chicken. Will be going back."}
{"text":"This place is great, the waitresses here will do anything and I mean anything! anywho you might have to wait a while for your food but when it comes down to it, it's totally worth it! The environment is great they keep the coffee full and they are just amazing people! I enjoyed my meal and will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place. The food was amazing with huge portions and it was quiet even though it was busy. Would highly recommend. I have never been disappointed with this food chain."}
{"text":"Well. Im absolutely terrified of Black Bears...but the bears at Black Bear Diner are non-threatening ;) 
This is one of my favorite spots for breakfast. The atmosphere here is so cozy, casual, and relaxing. It is amusing to look at the seemingly endless amount of black bear decor they have! 
The food is delish!!! They give you HUGE portions of food. I always get the traditional breakfast - eggs, potatoes, toast. Always a winner :) Their staff is friendly, but service is more on the slower side but that is nice too!
Definitely recommend this place is you have a big appetite for a classic breakfast :)"}
{"text":"Good food but bad service. It really just seems like they were all new employes and did not know how to do things correctly yet so theyd avoid fixing a problem. For starters we waited almost an hour for our food. Then they brought all but one plate. The server thought two were going to share a plate and offered an additional empty plate even after confirming what each person wanted. That made no sense to me. Then by the time they brought out the last persons plate everyone was finished with theirs. My daughter left to get to work. Mind u we were there 2 hours before her shift. Thats how long they took. Once we went to pay I mentioned the military discount to the cashier and my cousin pulled out his cards. She ran the credit card without the discount. I then confirmed she gave it to us and she said no. So i told her to do it over.  She asked her coworker how stating \"THEY didnt tell me till after i charged it.\" Then proceeded to contact the manager stating THEY again. Once the manager came she said it for a third time. That was very rude. Her name was Jessica. After that the manager says \"Well the card is already charged so there's nothing we can do. It doesnt matter anyway because its only going to take about $1 off. Correct me if im wrong but a $70 Check with 10% discounted would have been $7 off. After that he then says come closer and tells my cousin (the veteran) \"Heres a secret. Come in on saturdays between 10-2 and you can eat free, but dont tell anyone. I dont want my restaurant all packed crazy.\" I was upset because all they had to do was void out the charge and redo it. Hell, we couldve through a fit for how long a meal took and asked for it to be free which it shouldve been but i didnt want the server to get in trouble because he was a very nice kid. In the end it's safe to say i will never come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was hoping this place would be a great find and thought it would possibly be reminiscent of the one of a kind places we had back in the Midwest... Not so much.  I was told it is part of a chain.  I would actually like to give it 2.5 stars but as that is not an option, sadly I think it is more honest to give it 2 stars.  

I noticed that one of my friends said that asking for April had been very successful, so maybe the server here makes a big difference.

Also, it seems to appeal to older people and families with small children..."}
{"text":"Came here over my weekend in Vegas! Never had I had such great breakfast at a restaurant, the bacon was amazing, and orange juice fresh squeezed! Pancakes so yummy..Everything tasted fresh and good not all re-heated! I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I find we have been lazy a lot this week and do not want to cook. So off to the Black Bear Diner we go. It seems the vehicle parked next to us when we arrive is even more lazy than we as it was in a disabled space with no insignia to allow such. When the owner left they were just a rather fat young couple with a couple of kids. When we arrive they are pretty busy and the wait folks look somewhat frazzled. They ask where we want to sit and take us to a both at the back of the restaurant. This is one place I do not mind booths as the seat is shallow enough to allow my legs to bend at the right place. I am not sure what was going on here tonight but there were an over abundance of bubbas and their bimbos eating here. Dinner and theatre; cool. We came for fish and chips because that is what we were in the mood for and could think of nowhere near home that serves this except BBD. But as it always turns out we did not have what we came for, instead we ordered the fried chicken dinner. The chicken reminds us both of chicken we had as kids, very basic but good. Tonight was no exception; it was good for what it is. It comes with soup or salad and two sides. I personally think the side choice leave a lot to be desired. But what we got was fine. We both opted for the salad, which it just too big. In fact, too much food over all. I wish places like this offered half the size for half the money. We just have to remember next time to order one and share. Our wait person was fine if not overwhelmed at first. But being in that lazy mood I just did not mind sitting and watching the bubbas. She was a nice young lady with very pretty eyes."}
{"text":"We were at Black Bear Diner today after church. When we arrived they were very busy and said it would be a 30 minute wait, our wait was less than 15 minutes. The service was great. The orange juice was real and the food was like breakfast comfort food. So so good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Friendly, helpful staff.  Fast service, great food.  Reasonable prices for Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Love this place. It was the first for my family and boy we were not let down at all ,the sizes of the plates omg."}
{"text":"Have been here a couple of times for lunch. The food is great! It really tastes homemade. Today I had the turkey pesto sandwich it was really good. The portions are big so you could easily share with someone else. The staff has always been really nice and attentive."}

{"text":"We to Black bear restaurant on Sahara and Durango and a customer came in with two other people and he had a live squirrel on his shoulder and they allowed him to sit and eat..... are you serious it wasn't a service it was a companion my complaint is we had a large group and we come here a lot.... never again will we come here were they allow live animals that carry things.... I can understand a service dog....but a squirrel.... I'm  So shocked. We will never come her again. So please be careful before you come here"}
{"text":"I called it. This place was gonna be epic. Sunday Morning had to wait 30 minutes for a seat. People still smiling serving the best breakfast in town"}
{"text":"This place has pretty good breakfast.  It's far better then Denny's, but not as good as T.C. Eggington's... It's also priced pretty good compared to the huge food portions you get.  I had their country fried steak, which I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Awesome food at a great price.  I ordered the Bigfoot Chicken Fried Steak breakfast that came with 3 eggs, a chicken fried steak that took up half the plate and hash browns that were cut thick and cooked crispy brown.  On another plate came with 2 Sweet Cream Hotcakes with butter and syrup.  I came starving and I couldn't finish my breakfast.  All of that for $11.99.  My wife ordered the Huevos Rancheros and her portions were good sized and cooked perfectly.  The service was awesome and we were seated right away on a Sunday morning at 9:30.  it was crowded but the restaurant appeared to run smoothly.  I'll be coming back for their pot roast dinner and try their lunches too."}
{"text":"This place is good. The service is amazing. All the servers treat you like they have known you forever. The best part of the restaurant is the dessert. WOW!!!We had the chocolate brownie sundae and the chocolate cream pie. Was heaven"}
{"text":"Server we very polite and attentive. She described the special of the day and I went for it. The chorizo omelet was pretty good, portions are great, service was great, no complaints. My husband and I really had a great experience."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight while getting ready to order the waitress informed us they were out of mashed potatoes,baked potatoes and cornbread muffins due to the prep chef wasn't in today so we said to give us a few more min so I could decide on what I wanted so time to order and I asked for chicken pot pie waitress then said oh sorry we're out of that also this time due to it was coupon day I stated I don't see how you don't have all of this if it's coupons day seems you all all would of been prepSorry excuses she gave. Sign of a failing restaurant  Good Luck"}
{"text":"As soon as we drove up, we saw a line and that's usually a good thing. The wait wasn't that bad even though there was a lot of people waiting. Once we sat down, they got our drinks and then a little while later, we got our order taken and got our food shortly there after. Service was great and friendly. Food was pretty good and hearty. If you want something away from the strip, we would recommend going here. Eggs Benedict was pretty good as well as the waffle and eggs combo. Although the waffle could have been a bit crispier. Other than that, great food and service!"}
{"text":"The Skinny: so-so food at very affordable prices (3) service - okay, but not outstanding (3) value: very large portion sizes for the price (3).

We've been wanting to try this place out because of their breakfast specials. After a 5 mile morning hike to burn off some calories, we decided to finally hit the BBD for some good eats.

My hubby and I went with a bunch of pals. It was hit or miss whether the food was good.

My hubby enjoyed his ribs and fries - a very large portion size. The ribs were fall off the bone and layered with a good amount of BBQ sauce. They weren't the best ribs ever but they were good for the price. The corn muffin was not good due to the fact that it was stone cold. My hubby said that my corn muffins are better regardless... and I make mine from a box (Trader Joe's, baby), LOL!

I ordered their famous 7 almond granola pancakes ($6.99) which were alright. They are a rather large size (not Hash House a Go-Go size, but big enough). The flavours  were okay but the main issue was texture. They didn't have quite the fluffiness on the inside due to the amount of granola. Nor did they have the nice crispness on the outside either.

Our waitress was fine for a diner setting. She split our checks without a problem and was okay with the refills.

Overall, considering the service, food and value - this place rates a 3 star review."}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner has the most best breakfast and they give you so much, and our server Shannon was the most kind awesome server in the world, Thank You for your service wonderful people like you makes me want to come more often. Thanks again Carolyn A."}
{"text":"The food was OK.. average breakfast price.. loved the freshly squeezed orange juice.. and homemade biscuits. The pancakes were alright, too sweet and dense for my taste. Huge portions tho, so you'll definitely have extra to take home for the next day. Liked the country wood decor and staff was nice."}
{"text":"Ate here after seeing this off the 10 freeway.Me and my boyfriend came in the morning(super packed so sure to go early, especially Sunday mornings). The food is good and they give you a lot of food, they serve big portions. Costumer service also is good."}
{"text":"Today, Monday 7/25/2016 my wife and I revisited this location for a total of four times. Our first visit was an \"off\" day for the bear as it just opened months ago. Improvements were made as the Black Bear is on track. The service today was a little slow as our server's work load was very heavy. The Manager on Duty was Emily, she stepped in without any hesitation. Emily took our order and resolved all waiting issues. She checked on us several times and got the Black Bear under control. It's Managers like Emily who can make and break Restaurants. Emily is the main reason for our return to the Black Bear. Our meal arrived as ordered, hot and very enjoyable. Many thanks to Emily for stepping in and helping out her servers!"}
{"text":"Since Yelp took off my review since it was similar to another black bear I'm reposting my review.  Even though I gave this Black bear a bad review and the other a good review.

My main issue with this place was the time I went here which was on a Sunday, that I waited an extremely long amount of time to get seated.  It was because I was solo that day because there are no bar seats here for single customers it really seemed like anyone coming in by them selves waited way longer than customers in groups of two or more.

Food is good, the wait though wasn't."}
{"text":"Hooray!! A great new option in the area and our first impression was terrific! 

Went at 5:30 to get ahead of the crowd several Yelpers commented on, and were greeted, seated and ordered our dinner within five-ten minutes! 

We weren't being rushed, just knew what we wanted and needed to get home as our days start around 3:00 am!

Hubby enjoyed the chicken pot pie and I decided to check out their hot turkey dinner in case we need a backup plan on Thanksgiving!! 

Boy, was it good! Mashed potatoes were fresh and a little chunky and perfectly sliced turkey breast was moist and flavorful! Turkey gravy over both (server asked first) was just right...even Mom would've complimented their gravy!

I'd have taken a picture, but totally forgot after my first bite! Serving was big, brought almost half of it home...gotta have turkey sandwich tomorrow, right?!

Asked about Thanksgiving day - they're open regular hours, 6:00 am to 10:00 pm and turkey dinner begins after 11:00. They don't take reservations. Also saw there's a $19 prime rib special for the non-turkey folks in the group!

Staff was friendly, fast and helpful and we were in the car headed home just after 6:00!! Like I said, this place was terrific!!"}
{"text":"Almost never give five stars. 

Black Bear Diner was recommended by my daughter, we were visiting Phoenix and starving for a stellar breakfast.  

11:00, Friday morning and the place had a line out the door. Good sign. We got inside and waited 15 minutes, business was brisk. Happy people streaming out gave us a nice booth by the window. \"Booth guy for Life\". Yeeeaaah! Holla!  

Coffee was poured, order was taken.  Sipping on premium Java while waiting for my \"Joe's Hobo omelette and my wife's Portuguese sausage breakfast and Pineapple upside down cake pancake.  

Samm our server is a perfect fit for the job, no complaints on any of the staff.  

Food arrives and we dig in. It was one of those times when few words were spoken until our appetites were vanquished. A fitting tribute to a perfect traditional Midwestern style breakfast. 

Expectations were met, period. If I drop $30 plus bucks on breakfast I have expectations.  They were met in spades. 

Simply come here."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places for breakfast.  Today's my birthday and since I'm a member of the bear club mine is free.  The portions are very generous and the food is delicious.   The place is clean and most of the servers are on the ball.  The prices are standard.   We'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Just wonderful, absolutely great.  Orange juice is a little pricey, but everything else is spot on, and a great value!"}
{"text":"Best waffles ever!!! And you have to get the corned beef hash... so much corned beef with diced potatoes."}
{"text":"Awesome environment and great service!.
Food is delicious and humungous!.. my girlfriends and I stopped  by to eat from our road trip, Yelp them and was not disappointed!."}
{"text":"Always great food!  Love that my son can get his corn dogs for breakfast since he doesn't like breakfast. Service is also super friendly. You can even play Pokemon  while eating. There's a gym and pokestop while you eat!"}
{"text":"This is the 3rd Black Bear Diner we have eaten at. The service here was excellent as was the food.  Took half of my chicken & waffle home because it was so much food. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Always greeted with a friendly smile! Service is fast and friendly and the food is amazing! The California Bacon Benedict and the Country Fried Steak are delicious!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast . Will definitely be coming back! Can't wait to try the lunches. kimber my waitress was amazing. She made the experience all that much better. Hope to see her again!"}
{"text":"Great place, we love coming here for breakfast. Kids friendly menu and bear environment makes it feel like a quick out of town experience."}
{"text":"Well let's start off with our server was no where to be found.... until Nick came along and saved us. He was nothing short of amazing! He was really funny and helpful. The food took forever to come out, but heard they were short staffed, things happen. Can't always expect the best. 
I have breakfast of course and it was amazing! 
The manager we could over hear and he was a total creep talking about things you shouldn't with younger co workers. Wish the music was louder so we didn't have to hear that. 
We will be back."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I had the mini volcano which is just regular pancakes, eggs, sausage, and bacon. That's definitely enough food for one. The service wasn't okay, not bad. The food was great and I'll definitely come back the next time I'm in Arizona."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here the other day, and it was fantastic. The bacon was thick and meaty, the ham and eggs were both cooked exactly how I ordered, and the hash browns were great. The sweet cream pancakes are easily the highlight. I would come back for those alone.

The only thing that kept me from giving this place 5 stars is they advertised fresh squeezed orange juice and it was obviously from concentrate."}
{"text":"Was way exited to check out the new diner over in front of the outlet mall. 2pm craving some breakfast.  They weren't bizy at all... I ordered... waited almost 30min 12 of those saw my food sitting under the heat lamp, 2 employees including my waitress looked at it, then walked away, she came over and said ur food is almost ready. I said I sure hope so,  Then she went back to the same plate, picked it up and brought it to me. Of course it was cold... wow very disappointing since I love their food and usually the service too. Oh well good thing I wasn't starving...oh wait I was..."}
{"text":"Food was just ok.  But the service, oh, the service.  I could go on and on.  The server was Jonathan, and he could work at any restaurant he wanted, he was fantastic.  Talked to my daughter like she was a real person, never left us needing anything, seemed to anticipate our needs.  We might go back, mostly for the service....food....just ok."}
{"text":"Great service! I believe our sever was Alexander? He was great, funny, and recommended the best food on the menu! You could tell he really loved his job! The bear claw was really good, so was the chicken fried steak. My husband got the volcano which was a whole lot of food let overs for days!"}
{"text":"Ehh..? Usually this place is so good just this time was gross... I got the slam bowl which sounded good. So i ordered it withought jalapenos but they messed up so i sent it back without much of a scene it was a meh but when i got the correct thing it was just gross.. At one point it felt like i bit into a solid chunk of salt. Our waitress was nice but when we went to pay the guy up front asked how everything was and i said it was meh. He kinda was a jerk after. Also their coffee is pretty gross.. I just got home and drank some of mine that has been sitting in the fridge for hours and it was way better."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is AWSOME! I can't believe I drove by it so many times I took my family here today, the daughter loved the bears all around and the chocolate chip pancakes while we fell in love with the cinnamon roll french toast! ! ! That was out of this world, I would not recommend a regular omelette as it was not that good but other then that the whole breakfast was wonderfull.
Defiantly found I New tradition fir sunday morning..."}
{"text":"This place is really good. Portions are big so if your not too hungry you can split a plate with someone. We got the grilled chicken sandwiche it had BBQ and coleslaw very good. We substituted the chips for the fries. Fries are really good. 

Our server was Tahara and she was fantastic. First thing she told us was she was glad we were there. 

We will be back to try the breakfast soon. Highly recommended this spot. 

Customers service is great everyone is so welcoming."}
{"text":"MUST GO! 
Food and service was great.
If your planning on going on saturday or sunday....get ready to wait or get there earlier than you were planning on.
Breakfast was just amazing. 
French toast is best in town. (Yes,better than Egg Works, Hash House, Blueberry Hill, Baby Cakes, Baby Stacks, and James)

Great people from the door to our waitress.

Will continue to go back for a very long time."}
{"text":"Sat morning was packed, so we came back street the brunch rush at like 2... Wife got breakie and I got the chicken fried steak. She liked the fresh biscuit, I liked the corn bread with honey. The banana creme pie was pretty good too

Good choice if you're on the south end of the strip"}
{"text":"Big, hearty breakfasts.  Not much creativity, not much pizzaz - but if you're the sort of person who thinks breakfast is eggs, toast and bacon - you've hit the spot.  Did I mention BIG?  Man - this was a serious gut buster!  They did have better than average coffee.

The wait on a Saturday morning was too long - but I suppose for some people that means that they're popular.  Food took too long, too.  Our server was friendly, but clearly had too many tables to pay us much attention.  

I think I might stay with more local options in the future, but this isn't a bad choice if you don't want to take chances."}
{"text":"The Black Bear Diner is the most awesome place I have eaten in a long time the breakfast are awesome service is excellent the coffee is good the biscuits are ridiculously big I love it I will go back again"}
{"text":"My friend had a craving for breakfast, so after we finally rolled out of bed after a late night, we decided to try this place, which is close to where we were staying.

I had the corned beef hash and it was pretty good. Big chunks of corned beef, but not too much hash, so I got the hash browns, which made up for the lack of potato. 

I asked the waitress for some Tabasco, and I'm glad I didn't wait for her to give it to me. I ended up finishing my meal before she came back to check up on us.

Everyone was satisfied with their respective meals, but didn't rave about their choices. Overall, a decent breakfast place off the strip."}
{"text":"Currently sitting at my table waiting for my food, everyone around me as gotten their meal yet here i am waiting, my refill on my coffee,my boyfriends dr.pepper empty, Coming from another server, this is crap service . Comping my drinks and free dessert doesnt always work. Dirty floors and the manager looks pissed off ."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of really good things about Black Bear, especially for breakfast and I finally decided to go. Honestly I thought the food was good but nothing special (definitely not 5 star worthy). I'd say for diner food it lives up to any expectations I would have. With the exception of the French toast being a little soggy, all of the other food ordered by the table was good. The service was friendly, and the food was delivered really quickly after we ordered. We were in and out of the restaurant in under 45 minutes. Finally, I joined their e-club and got a cup of coffee and a GIANT bear claw for free. The bear claw was tasty so I recommend joining the club, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Awesome!!!  To find linguica cooked this well anywhere outside of Northern California is impossible.  Great service, and all around good vibe."}
{"text":"The food was alright, nothing to brag about. However, there was dead mosquito on the window seal next to my seat. I absolutely cannot stand bugs so I got a little grossed out but no biggy. I told the hostess and she just gave me a napkin and said she can't reach the bug. Uhm I don't want to clean a dead bug while I'm trying to eat. I was really grossed out and I thought it was inhospitable of the hostess to make me clean it up for her while I'm eating."}
{"text":"Huge portions amazing staff very friendly and great gm. The servers are on top of everything never had to ask for anything are server never let are drinks get empty and always checked on us. The dessert is amazing the bread pudding is to die for a must try. The cherry cobbler is just as amazing."}
{"text":"They have the best Chicken Fried Steak in Vegas, so far. The outer crust stays crunchy while wonderfully smothered by creamy white gravy. Served with hash brown and eggs. The Big Foot chicken fried steak plate is huge and good enough for two to share.

the Bread Pudding is great, even better with vanilla ice cream! It's topped off with warm Pecan Praline sauce, and as the ice cream slowly melts combining with the sauce, it then becomes a whole new creamy thick buttery sweet goodness and is absorbed into the bread pudding = a spoonful of decadent creamy bread pudding deliciousness, mmmm"}
{"text":"Greatest course was a super-fresh salad. Entrees were okay. Looking forward to trying breakfast here some other trip west."}
{"text":"Alright I'm gonna be completely honest....I expected so much more from Big Bear Diner. Maybe I just expect too much in general, but I thought their menu would've had more of a variety of foods.

Decided to check them out because we wanted a cool breakfast joint. My boyfriend usually orders skillets when we go out for breakfast...but big bear doesn't have any skillets on their menu! That was a shocker because skillets are freaking amazing!!!! Don't you guys agree? Anyways...he decided to order a meat omelet with hash browns (so boring compared to a skillet, LOL) and I had the corned beef hash with biscuits and hash browns. Talk about carb overload! I felt so heavy after my breakfast meal, I literally ate only half my biscuit and some corned beef. Don't get me wrong, my food was good and I enjoyed it. But maybe I was so full because of all the hash browns they put on my plate. Service wasn't bad,
an older gentleman helped us while we were there. 

Probably not coming back here, sorry big bear! I just wasn't all that impressed."}
{"text":"I gave one star because the food is really good! But I give a great big \"0\" for service today! My hubby and I walked in for lunch and the hostess sat us right away, then 2 of the female servers stood in the section next to us arguing over which one of them was going to serve us! The one that \"lost\" came over and asked what we wanted to drink. Came back a few minutes later with our drinks and took our orders. She brought our food out, sat it down and said \"enjoy\" as she turned her back and walked away. 5 minutes later she walked by our table and tossed the bill down and said \"pay it on your way out\". That was it, no \"is there anything else I can get for you\"? No \"how is everything\"? And she never came back. This is the 2nd time we have had terrible customer service at this restaurant from female servers. I love the food here but seriously thinking about finding a new place to eat. (And we did complain to the manager, he was very apologetic)"}
{"text":"OMG the sweet cream waffles and their link sausage is the best around!!! And the prices are great. Been here like 4 times and all the servers were great ."}
{"text":"Love this place! As a local we eat here every time we are in the area. Service is always great and food is delicious."}
{"text":"Is it a crime that I have lived in Vegas for so long and never tried this southwest staple? I must say I was pleasantly surprised and would liken their food to an upscale Denny's. They are a chain and seem to be going for a friendly, down-to-earth, home-cooked American vibe. They serve everything on their menu (breakfast, lunch and dinner) all day long. That said, they were out of both chicken and the steak that comes with the Steak and Eggs when I was there. The chicken was fine because I didn't want any and they subbed my steak for a nicer more expensive steak so I was happy about that. The food and atmosphere are four stars, I am a fan!

The service is the reason for the extra star on this review. While the gentleman who got us our drinks really seemed to hate his life - which is always awkward- our server and the manager made up for it. My steak was overcooked, it was medium well or medium when I asked for medium rare. I told the waitress but also insisted that it was still a great steak and I would be happy to finish it - which I was! The steak was legit I just wanted them to know it was cooked wrong in case that is something they wanted to address in the kitchen later. Anyway the manager came over shortly after and apologized and gave us some Bear Bucks and a free dessert. I refused it at first because I hate taking anything from restaurants for free- I never want anyone to think I just wanted something for free especially when most of the time its the principle that matters. We did end up taking the Bear Bucks for our next visit but did not opt for the dessert because we were so stuffed. I was impressed at their response when I was seriously hardly making a fuss. There are some restaurants you have to flip tables at in order to make them fix their mistakes. I was happily surprised by their forwardness and I will be back!"}
{"text":"We came here because they could sit a big group, we had 17 People in our party along with 5 kids. We made a reservation for 11 o'clock, seated at 11:30, waited another 10 mins to get our drinks, another 10 mins to order and
Maybe 20-30 mins to get our food. We never got our waters refilled by the time we were 3/4 done with our food I finally had to raise my cup in the air and luckily the very nice manager saw that I needed a refill and came back to refill everyone's drink at the table. I wasn't too impressed with the food. It was not worth the wait for something that I probably could've gotten at a Denny's diner. They did offer a military discount, our bill came out to $201! Again not impressed with the food, my $10 omelet was bland and small along with the old ass fruit. The service was not that great, the manager made up for it with his personality and had a good attitude."}
{"text":"Food was ok but the service was great , thank you Sandor for your attentive service. 
I order the steak and eggs w/ home fries; the potatoes were a little on the hard side. The portions are huge so bring your appetite."}
{"text":"Against my usual review I'm starting with the negative. I was expecting absurdly large dishes because the word \"bear\" is in the name of the diner. I'm not a bear of a man, but I'm tall and I can eat a lot... and I need to eat a lot. Don't stop me. I'll eat you. So I found the portions to be disproportional to implied proportions........ wait.... 

Anyways! Lovely diner! Spacious and lots of options! This place has a lot of history they happily share with you on the menu, although to my knowledge this specific location is new.

I took some new friends here to say \"thanks for being my friends.\" They were a beautiful couple in their 80's. I highly recommend going to diners with people over the age of 70, for some reason it makes the food taste better and you're bound to hear some amazing stories. 

If you're curious, I got the Blazin' Bear Sandwich and thus my initial complaint. The description makes it seem like it's going to be insane and filling... and it was quite small. My male friend got a burger, and my female friend got a salad. Everyone was pleased, but as I mentioned... I was underwhelmed. 

The service was great! And there's plenty of parking! Of course there's parking, because it's not LA or New York, can you tell I'm not from here? Bye!"}
{"text":"This review is specifically for the staff.  They are fantastic and treat their local regulars with respect and dignity - which is especially important for those old retired folks with no family.  They treat their customers just like family and truly care about everyone they serve.  I was so impressed with the wait staff at this location, they certainly deserve 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I guess this whole chain is horrible. 
I waited to be sat for 5 minutes. Staff everywhere but where they need to be. 
I was served a coffee mug with lipstick still on it. 
The food was mediocre. Nothing to write about. 
This place isn't worth the trip."}
{"text":"This place is a SH*T Hole!!! We went there tonight at 8:00 we were seated right away , when she took us to our table there was food all over the floor ewe! Started reading menu,waited for at least 15minutes no waiter or waitress , no one asked if we wanted a drink . I looked at my wife and said I can't do it we are leaving . So I can't review the food and I never will because I won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent friendy service, huge portions and the food was excellent. The hash browns were the best! The biscuit was twice the size of other places and way better because it was so light and fluffy. Did I mention the excellent service?  Our server checked on us regularly without being annoying and didn't interrupt a conversation which I hate.  I can see why people wait for a table."}
{"text":"They literally have the best pancakes in Henderson. They are huge and they serve them with real maple syrup and sweet cream butter. I got a side of crispy bacon and scrambled eggs. Their portions are definitely big enough to share if you want to. So glad this place is down the street."}
{"text":"Normally we come for breakfast, always good, went today and had a specialty burger, bad mistake, husband wanted his med. mine no pink, they both came exactly the same, DRY! He got bacon and pickles I got neither, finally got waitress attention she took plate got bacon and no pickles! Meanwhile frys are getting cold! Had to ask for more ice tea, why is it cloudy?? Suppose to be a bigger burger than regular burger, the meat was barely there! Suppose to have cheddar on it, a sprinkle of cheddar cheese does not make a cheese burger!  So my opinion is NEVER go there for anything but breakfast!"}
{"text":"WOW!!! What is going on with this place????
It's been a couple of months since I've been back. Once again,  I left extremely disappointed. I got seated and it took a few minutes for a server to come to my table. Now, it seems like every time I visit,  there's an issue with who's got my table. My last visit, I left because nobody greeted me. I ordered The Grizz eggs medium, country potatoes,  no pancakes extra sourdough. My eggs came over easy and RUNNNY!!! The bread, was not toasted and had no butter  (I had to ask for spread) there was this half eaten leaf lettuce with a limp square of watermelon that I'm assuming was garnish.  
This place is popular and used to be flawless.  
Somewhere it went south. 
I'm taking the hint, it seems as if I'm not a welcomed customer. I'm now at place called Hen House Cafe. I highly recommend it. It won't matter, 
BUT I AM NEVER RETURNING TO BLACK BEAR DINER. GOODBYE!!!"}
{"text":"My friend asked me to breakfast since I was off today. She said we should try Black Bear as a change from the restaurant we normally frequent, right up the street from them. We were greeted promptly. Our server was good. Though, I felt we should worry when there was more staff than there were patrons. I really wanted to be objective. However, I could not help but compare the food to my regular establishment. And the food was nothing to write home about. I ordered an omelet and asked to add diced onions and diced bacon, but what I got was roughly chopped onions and bacon.  Despite ordering my side of bacon crispy, the bacon in my omelet was limp and barely cooked, to my standards. The one good thing was the freshly squeezed orange juice. $55 later and dissatisfied. We never spent over $30 at the other place. I decided I would pay with my credit card and leave a cash tip. I took it as an affront when the server took the check before we were finished and before we left her tip. She saw no tip on the slip and never came back. We left $10 on a $45 tab, despite her not returning to our table. I never write reviews, but felt that, if I did not, how would others know. Also, how would the employees and owner(s) truly know how my first and last visit to this restaurant went?"}
{"text":"Went here for halloween date, the foods were delicious & amazing... for bringing us the tomato basil soup, n thousand island salad, corn muffins than the new york steak was so good n country fried steak with onion rings too...
We just had to take it home with us..."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for breakfast. We had the following:

Pineapple upside down cakes $7.99

Chicken Apple Sausage with Eggs and Hash Browns $9.99

Hot Turkey Plate $11.99

Everything was pretty good. I like how they serve lunch and dinner all day. The turkey was moist and flavorful. My wife said her sausage was a little sweet but with some hot sauce it was better. We were so full that we packed the pineapple cakes to go. The only negative I would say about our meal was that the pineapple was canned and not fresh. Overall, I would say this is a good place to eat if you are lazy to cook. Portions are huge and you will definitely be stuffed as a bear after eating here..."}
{"text":"Place was recently remodeled! Very comfortable environment. Food was excellent!! Best refried beans I've ever had and the chicken enchiladas were amazing!! My boyfriend had one of their burgers. You get a lot of food for your money!! Will come again!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Right when I walked in I was seated. I had multiple people ask if I had been helped, which shows they don't let anyone just sit. My food came promptly. I got the chicken fried steak and eggs. Some of the best I have ever had and the eggs were cooked exactly like I prefer them. Very reasonable for the portions. I liked the diner feel it had as well! It made me feel as though I was out in the mountains eating at a family diner."}
{"text":"This place is great! I went here with my mother and her girlfriends while visiting for the holidays. They are breakfast  connoisseurs and was very excited to hear there was a new place in town! Immediately entering the restaurant the atmosphere was adorable  and cozy. The hostest was nice and even accepted all my corny jokes. Service was excellent! My cup never went empty and Ashton made sure we got everything we needed and more! The coffee is great and when they brought out the plates...OH MY...they were huge!!!! Only constructive criticism is that I ordered the eggs Benedict and the yolks were hard...but I still really enjoyed my meal regardless!! So good! Will definitely be coming back!! Thanks for the superb breakfast!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't great, the service was sub par. The restaurant was super hot inside and uncomfortable, I understand it's summer time in Las Vegas but I've been to other restaurants and they're nice and cool, the price isn't bad. I probably won't try this place again with all the other options close by to choose from."}
{"text":"Everyone here is so nice. Jordan was great and our waitress Cathy was efficient and fast sweet cakes are DOPE!!!"}
{"text":"Go and eat here for breakfast often.  Huge portions.  Generally everything is good. Waiting staff is amazing on the weekend!  Friendly."}
{"text":"I can't believe no one has been raving about the BISCUITS! They are huge, like softball size(see photos) and very tasty. I eat here everytime I venture to Vegas and every visit has been nothing short of awesome! The steak and eggs was very good, the steak tender and flavorful. I have been here a couple times for lunch and it was equally good. I think I had the patty melt and my friend had the chicken fried steak, which was huge and covered in country gravy. I totally recommend this place. It's a few miles off the strip, but well worth the drive."}
{"text":"Food and service are good. You definately get a lot of food for the money!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my first experience here. Black Bear Diner is a family-style restaurant (breakfast, lunch and dinner) that originated in California by a couple buddies wanting to serve home-cooked meals. They cook up many of their entrees in house (like their turkey breast) and make up their own meatloaf, cobblers and biscuits (something many family restaurants don't do anymore). I'm a huge camper and enjoyed the outdoor theme decor and wood-carved bears all over the place. The portion sizes are pretty big. I got the Corned Beef Hash and had to take most of it home. I didn't order any, but the pies and bear claws in the window display looked amazing. The prices here are comparable with any other family restaurant. I'm not a big lover of chain restaurants, but this place is way better than the Applebee's that used to be here."}
{"text":"This place was really good when it first opened, then slowly starts going downhill after that. The last couple times I was in for breakfast the service sucked, waited forever for my food, and when I finally got it, it wasn't very good. Haven't been back since."}
{"text":"If you come for lunch be sure to come early because this place gets packed. Although it was my 1st time at this location, I had been to a Black Bear before. They serve up traditional diner food with generous portions. Prices are about the same as any other diner I've been to in town and are pretty reasonable for the amount of food you're getting. The service was decent despite the amount of people that were dining and there was constantly a line waiting to be seated. I would come again, but either earlier or later in the day to avoid the noon lunch rush"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrible... The food was bland and not warm. Our waitress was awful, wasnt even busy and she stop by our table twice. Never gave me a refill for my drink... i had to ask someone else for a refill . I dont why the reviews for this place are good because service is horrible and food isnt that good or unique. Avoid this place everyone it isnt worth it."}
{"text":"First time at this Black Bear. Been to another with good results. 

Arrived at 11:15 on a Sunday morning at it was hopping, so I sat at the counter. Jessica greeted me right away, brought a menu and offered iced tea and the day's special. I accepted the iced tea but opted for biscuits and gravy. It came with two eggs and a protein for $8.99. 

The eggs were fine. Tough to screw up sunny side up eggs.   The biscuits were light and fluffy and the highlight of the meal.  The gravy was in serious need of further cooking. Taste of flour pervaded, without much else to help it. No sausage or bacon flavor. Just bland, really. If the dish is called Biscuits and Gravy, both better deliver but only one part did. 

The sausage was good and it reminded me of the kind my mom made while I was growing up. 

The portions at Black Bear Diner are always plentiful even for this big guy. 

Not a bad meal, just not the 'home cooking' meal I was really after."}
{"text":"Arrived for breakfast on Fourth of July. I had been by this restaurant many times and this was my first experience eating here. The food was great, the service was excellent. Nichole was our waitress and she was very attentive to our needs, had great timing, was friendly and professional. 

I would recommend Black Bear Diner to friends and family and plan to eat here again for dinner."}
{"text":"Hi,
In a recent vacation to Last Vegas I visited the Black Bear Diner two times.

The food was excellent with large portions.

The best part however, was the Server Tahra. She is super friendly, efficient, and  in every way charming. 

This restaurant and this Server will be my regular breakfast stop when I'm in town.
Thanks."}
{"text":"After many suggestions from friends about this place, I decided to take hungover BF there for breakfast this past Saturday. Disappointed that I hadn't gone sooner!!  This place is great!  There are a ton of breakfast options, small portions, large portions.  The menu is on a newspaper with actual articles from back in the day. Ours was from 1986. It was nice being able to read some history from back then.  I ordered the 7 grain nut pancakes, eggs, and bacon, while he ordered the huge chicken fried steak that came w/ hash browns or diced red potatoes w/ onions and pappers, eggs, and choice of toast, biscuit, or ...?? something else. The food came out promptly....maybe 10-15 minutes max.  I don't know if coffee was something i really needed that morning or not, but it was super good for some reason!  (I was sober.)   Every staff member there was extremely friendly and perky!  That is so nice to see that they really do care and are not putting on an act just to make some money.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nice traditional diner. Generous portions. Food sometimes is a little bland but is served up quickly and the staff is friendly. Weekend breakfast and lunch times are very busy so be ready to wait. Also the parking is not the best during times and may need yo venture into the hotel parking lot."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Although this is my go to breakfast place. I do have other favs on their menu.

The portions are HUUGE. If you have a small appetite then you probably want to share or if you like leftovers than you'll probably have lots I can never finish my food but it's so de-lish! 

Once again, Lol. I LOVE THIS PLACE. The end."}
{"text":"Normally we are a fan of this establishment.  The service we received yesterday was not good.  Honestly the waitress was kind of a bitch.  She was pregnant but that is not an excuse when you are in the service industry.  The food was what we have come to expect from the Black Bear, but I did have to say something to the manager about the attitude of the server."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, however the server Tom was a bit disconnected,  not attentive and borderline rude. Greeting tables next to my party but barely making any contact with us. We waited for straws and went most of our meal without any refills. Food is good but management needs to up the ante on their employee customer service expectations."}
{"text":"Last night our family went to dinner here. My wife ordered the turkey dinner. After quite a long wait everyone in our party saw how pink the turkey was that was being served to her. The turkey had a very strange pink discoloration throughout. We brought it to the attention of our server who insisted that although other customers had returned the same meal for the same reason that day that the turkey was completely safe to eat. After we continued to express our concerns to our server who wanted to drag out the discussion rather then simply taking the dinner back, she went to her manager who apparently told her the same thing she said to us, how the meat was safe and that for some reason all day the turkey dinners were being cooked for the same times but the turkeys were coming out from either white or pink all day but no one had gotten sick. We insisted that they take the dinner back and my wife ordered the bbq ribs. By this time the rest of us were almost done eating our meals. After another long wait and thinking my wife's dinner would soon be out, our server came back and said they were sold out of ribs. So then my wife found another item on the menu but by this time the rest of us finished our dinner. Finally after another very long wait, my wife was finally served her third choice meal.
In addition, while my Mom was eating her dinner salad she pulled a large round, hard and black object out. We weren't sure what it was but it did look pretty gross.
At no time did the Manager ever come to our table to apologize or to offer how to make things right. We feel that we should've received a comp for my wife's meal or a percentage off or something to make things right but they didn't seem to care about the absolutely terrible service we received.
The rest of our meals were okay but certainly not the worth anywhere close to 122.00 dinner bill. 
We will NEVER return to the Black Bear Diner again."}
{"text":"Good food, huge biscuits, lots of food selections, very reasonable price. The employees are very friendly and attentive. We are locals so we're keep going back to this place."}
{"text":"If I can give this place a negative star, I would! My husband and I came here for breakfast and the service was slow the whole meal. After having a discrepancy on the bill, the hostess grab the manager, and the manager was very rude. Her tone was very condescending, and she only made things worse. While talking to the manager, the hostess jumped back in the conversation only to tell my husband he was wrong."}
{"text":"Another great meal at Black Bear Diner. Obviously there is a wait to get a table for a weekend breakfast but it is well worth it. The Corned Beef Hash is must have from the menu. No can here, just shredded brisket fried up with just a little potato and onion. Delish. Also tried the Blueberry Sweet Cream pancakes which were simply fabulous. Service was very good, everyone smiling and giving a welcoming feeling even when they were getting slammed. Waitress was helpful and they gladly made the substitutions I inquired about. She came around often to warm up my coffee which surprisingly is decent for a chain family restaurant. Will be back whenever I return to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This was our second or third time going to a black bear diner and we like it a lot. I ordered the chicken and waffles and I would probably be ordering it again. My one wish was that the waffle was crunchy. The eggs Benedict and hash browns were great and my daughter loved her chocolate chip pancakes and devoured every bite of fruit from our table. They make a mean Arnold Palmer too."}
{"text":"Open faced turkey sandwich with gravy and French fries. The best I've had. Gravy is delicious and came with cranberry sauce as well. Overall good experience. The wait wasn't long, service is good and waitress is very friendly. Will come again."}
{"text":"Our first time here for lunch & we will definitely be back soon to try the dinner items!! Food was great and our server, Gary, was excellent!!! Thanks for a wonderful experience Black Bear Diner!"}
{"text":"Black Bear has the best breakfast! Their pancakes are to die for, their coffee really great for a restaurant, and just enough tacky diner feel to make it great! We have been several times and every time has been fantastic. Totally worth a 30 min wait if it is busy!"}
{"text":"My daughter ordered a black berry pie to take home.  Well upon cutting it and eating it this evening we realized how pathetic this pie is... literally no crust on the bottom just some black berries thrown in the tin and a dome  of nasty  crust.  Unbelievable they sell this to people for  $5.00 save your money and don't buy this awful tin full of black berries with hallow crust."}
{"text":"First time here and it sucked.. So disappointed in the service, David was rude as hell.. our waitress couldn't even get our bill right. Too many people in there that couldn't stop staring. Didn't enjoy anything about this place. *Had no choice but to give a star, if it were up to me I wouldn't have given any star*"}
{"text":"New location so thought we would give it a try.  Smaller then the other locations but not a bad wait was quoted about 20min's  so we decided to try the counter. Waitress was Maggie very nice, quick and attentive.  We both had the bears choice comes with two eggs, choice of meat & pancakes or waffle. Everything tasted great.  Price is a bit high for breakfast but definitely worth a do again."}
{"text":"Fantastic local diner, great food and not like other brunch places in town that are only open till 2-3pm,  it's open for breakfast, lunch and dinner!!!  Will definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"Great place for r breakfast.  We always come here for breakfast when in Las Vegas.  Price is very reasonable and coffee is always on point!"}
{"text":"Arrived with the Saturday morning crowd, so there was a bit of a wait. 
My 2-egg special was great. Really loved their hash browns. They'll completely spoil you however. You'll never be satisfied again from with those \"fresh from the Sysco-bag,\" so-called hash browns. 
Plus, it's so doggone hard these days to find anyplace that doesn't serve Sysco-manufactured sausage patties. I ordered them \"hot\" style. Would likely go with the mild next time but good to experience. One was way overdone. 
The wife's pancakes, highly touted by the menu were not cooked all the way through."}
{"text":"Came to get some chicken soup  an a few dinners , for the next 2 days because im really sick got home ready to eat some chicken soup nowhere to be found, the tri tip dinner an meatloaf dinner look great but was really looking forward to some soup"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! Found our new favorite eatery off the strip where we can enjoy a leisurely relaxed affordable meal. Our group had a variety of breakfast selections - eggs, meats, hash, hot cakes, biscuits, etc., all served with efficiency and a friendly smile!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.   The first trick is to find a Black Bear restaurant. When you do you will eat well at reasonable prices. While in Las Vegas I had breakfast there twice. Definitely the best corned beef hash & egg breakfast I have ever had. My recommendation:  Goggle them and find one that you can visit. BTW - service was excellent."}
{"text":"Big portions, more then enough food to feed two people, waitress always on top of everything, will be coming back."}
{"text":"We arrived about 1:30 on a Sunday afternoon and saw a huge line, so I expected a long wait for a table. I was mistaken; that was the line of people all exiting at the same time. We were seated right away, but after about 10 minutes of no one stopping at our table (although they made eye contact so they knew were there) I finally had to ask someone if we had a server assigned to our table. The server took our drink order then several minutes later said she couldn't find our who our server was, so she took over the table. It took quite awhile for our order to arrive, way longer than one would expect for a BLT, grilled cheese, and chicken strips. The server was friendly, but not enough to make up for the lack of attention. I doubt we will be back to this location."}
{"text":"Thank you black bear management 
Went back yesterday and it was a total different experience 
The service was great 
The food was excellent 
That's the way to fix a problem thanks again I will be back"}
{"text":"My mom and I went for dinner and figured we should try something different so we walked into the Black Bear Diner!  Never been there before and sure glad we did! The portions are huge and prices are way less than I figured for the size of the plates! The staff were very friendly and ever so helpful!  Anthony our waiter stayed on top of everything,  our empty plates didn't stay  on our table for long and we never saw the bottom of our coffee cups (that were a decent size!)! Marlene was very inviting and made sure we knew about the membership program as well as the awesome remodel that's going to start soon! 

I had my very first omelet with avocado and I loved it! Mom had the pot roast OMG that was great too! 

We took most of it home!"}
{"text":"Ate there on New Year's Day. Sat at the counter. Everything was authentic. Food, customers service and atmosphere. Definitely going again."}
{"text":"Almost didn't eat here because of the negative reviews. But being a restauranteur myself I had to give them the benefit of the doubt. I'm glad me & my family decided to stay. The service might not be the best but the food was amazing. My favorite when choosing breakfast is Chicken fried steak & pancakes. Boy o boy it was one of the best pancakes I've ever had & I've tried many. The chicken fried steak was well on point. We each sampled each other's plate & all was well. Definitely would be a place to go again on a special occasion."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good service and food for the very first day.  Always love black bear nice to have one on this side of town.  Cheap comfort food but it tastes good which is hard to balance.  I would definitely check it out. I had the post roast - huge plate of food but it was all very good."}
{"text":"Well a definite \"bear theme\" and a hearty appetite is highly required.  We had heard of this place and thought to give it a try this time.  Needless to say a surprise is well hidden here and you will not go away either hungry or dissatisfied.  Can find this diner throughout CA, UT, ID and in a few other places so keep an ear out for them. A recommend for sure."}
{"text":"What a waste of $20 for one person to eat breakfast. I just had French toast with a side of bacon and a glass of orange juice and would give zero stars if the Oj wasn't good. 

The French toast was made out of a bear claw pastry and then battered and fried, it was disgusting and not what I was expecting. 

The bacon was the driest piece of bacon I've ever had my life. It is sad to say but I would rather eat at Denny's then at this place ever again"}
{"text":"We were recently looking for a new breakfast spot and decided to give Black Bear Diner. 

The interior is pretty cute. There are tons of teddy bears watching over the diners. 

I decided to have the south of the border omelette with chorizo. It was okay but nothing special. 

My wife got the cinnamon roll French toast. It was pretty good, and I thought it was a neat concept. 

While overall the food was pretty good, I don't think I'd go again for breakfast because there are better breakfast joints in town. I might give it a try for lunch or dinner though."}
{"text":"Got here because the one in Tempe was closed, PC issues.  This place in Phoenix was packed, my food took 7-minutes and perfect.  I always go to the Black Bear if I see one.  Friendly, fast, the cooks ended up with $10 tip...it was that good.
Thanks guys"}
{"text":"9 min 36 secs for chicken and waffles.  My friend said they are crazy good.  My Beni is always perfect.  Everytime I go through Tempe.  I eat here.  Always amazing.  Thanks to Amber"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to this place for Valentines Day to try it out! I love breakfast food and so we decided on this diner since we always pass by it. It was absolutely DELICIOUS!!! We had such a great time!! The orange juice is pricey BUT so WORTH IT!!!! It's handmade orange juice and it's amazing!!! My juicer at home broke years ago but the taste of that OJ made me buy another one. Forgot how good natural OJ tasted. The hash browns were to die for. This place is so good. We (obviously) will be coming back. Compared to big chains like IHOP & Denny's, it's less expensive and tastes way better."}
{"text":"I rarely yelp any reviews but wanted to share my experience here. This was my first time at a black bear diner, and sadly possibly my last. 

I came here for dinner with my husband and 2 kids. I had ordered the chicken fried steak. After waiting about 20 mins, the waitress brought out my children's dishes while my husband and I waited for ours. We got our plates about 5 mins later. I absolutely don't mind waiting some time for my food. Because I know it's being cooked fresh. Mine was a little too fresh tho. 

The chicken fried steak was so raw it was still mooing. I showed the waitress and she could see it was severely undercooked. I had pretty much lost my appetite by then for any steak and just opted for chicken fingers to go because by that time everyone else at the table was just about done eating. 

The manager on duty was very accommodating with comping my plate and offering some gift cards and a free pie. Which was pretty good by the way.. and if it wasn't for that and the nice employees, I'd probably rate this place one star. But after all, it is a restaurant and I'm basing my review on the food that was given to me lol. 

I wish I could say I had a better experience, because I really wanted to try this place. Maybe I'll try again some other time, because i understand mistakes can happen, but I'm not sure it'll be anytime soon."}
{"text":"Sorry but my food was not good. I order Meatloaf dinner ... Not good... Meatloaf taste old and tasteless with tons of gravy??? I knew something was not right.. and mash potato with the same gravy all over .. No flavor, my plate was cover in grease from under.. i have to clean my plate with the napkins. I hear this place is great for breakfast .. i guess i have to try again but this time for breakfast. 
For meatloaf i can make it better, i done before .. and for some reason taste many times better."}
{"text":"Kool spot always good ambience prices are good and they will over load and don't mind u splitting the plate...so no worries..."}
{"text":"Great food, great service Spring our server did an outstanding job. We will be back with the whole family."}
{"text":"I have been to black bear diner's before. Most of those I would rate a lot higher, particularly the one in Mesa. This one is skimpy on the food and it's seldom cooked properly although sometimes it is. This one is not at all reliable. I've been there six times since it opened thinking that it would get better, they were just going through opening pains. But no. No improvement at all."}
{"text":"Came here this morning it was a 30 minute wait to be seated, but service was pretty prompt so there was hardly any wait to get drinks or our food. I ordered the grizzly breakfast to share with my son it was a pretty big plate or plates i should say because the pancakes were gigantically sitting on a plate themselves.  Overall the food was good and freshly made you do need to add salt and pepper to everything since nothing is really seasoned my husband ordered the biscuits and gravy and they didnt really have any flavor, the pancakes were sweet probably could eat them without syrup if need be.  Our waitress was really nice as well so thats always a plus."}
{"text":"Love Black Bear, travel all the way across town to go here.  Its very \"country\" almost out of place in Vegas.  Portions are huge - be ware - but the food I've had was always just good.  Nothing fancy or pretentions, just good food and friendly.  Have had breakfast, lunch and dinner (and blackberry cobbler - wow), all rocked.  Kind of low-end and spotty consistency-wise the only knocks."}
{"text":"I've avoided it as long as I can, but I did go back to the Black Bear Diner as it's still my Dad's favorite place for breakfast. You know what? I'm glad I went. It was actually a pleasant experience and for the most part, the place has vastly improved from my last visit. 

First of all, they offer fit fare selections on the menu which is important to me. The portion of egg whites I had was way more than advertised, but that's ok because it was a vegetarian omelet that was filled with veggies that I don't ordinarily find in an omelet: squash, zucchini, and more! I asked if I could skip the toast and just have fruit and the server gave me a double portion of fruit! Nice! 

Dad had the french toast and he loved it. It's a generous portion of french toast and more than he could finish. 

And the server was really very nice. She smiled and kept smiling the whole time she served us! Yeah...I know, right? Crazy! She was pleasant, friendly, and prompt with service. Loved it. 

I might actually suggest we go back again the next time I meet Dad for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I think this place is OK.  The food is decent and the service is fine.  However, in all fairness, I have only eaten breakfast here a few times so I cannot comment on the lunch and dinner items on their menu.  I especially like one of their breakfast menu items, which is the Portuguese sausage and eggs option.  The sausage is tasty and a nice big one at that.  They also have ala carte breakfast options on their menu, but no option for additional eggs.  Most of their breakfast choices come with two eggs, but for me personally, I would like to add an additional egg or two.  All-in-all, I think this place is OK."}
{"text":"I had seen this restaurant in Mesa before, but had not tried it.  When it opened up in South Chandler, and I was in the area, so decided to try it out.  I was surprised they were not that busy for lunch.  There were two servers and the manager.  it became busier and the servers had a hard time keeping up with the orders but they were very friendly about it.  I know they were trying. The food was tasty.  It seems like they should have had at least one more person working to keep up.  Fun place to take visitors."}
{"text":"Food was good! I got the Western BBQ burger, the sauce tasted great and the burger was delicious. The fries were good, diner style. I liked this place. The menu is overwhelming but that's a good thing! Lol I'll be back to try everything else! I loved the decor!!"}
{"text":"Waitress was the best.  We had a large party snd she did great even with the kids.  Food is very good and pretty reasonable.  The kids loved it there.  We ordered a wide range of menu items and there were no complaints from anyone.  Everybody there was friendly and courteous.   Had a great time and great meal."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast today. Only been open two days so I don't know how they got 5 stars? Food and service are good. Portions are like other Black Bears, ver large. Too many people coming to table to ask how everything is. Check comes to soon before you finish your meal. 
Hash browns VERY dry, pancakes and eggs great. We usually go to Tropicana location but this one is closer to home. We will be going back after we give them time to get their act together.
Beautiful job of restoring an old Greek restaurant."}
{"text":"The service here is great. Everyone is extremely friendly--to the point that it rubs off on all of the customers and creates a really awesome, happy atmosphere. 

The food is good, not great. I've had it better at other Black Bear locations, which made me feel like the prices were kind of steep."}
{"text":"So overall the food here was great.. very filling and reasonably priced for huge portions.. the menu is the Newspaper by the way. lol I am excited to make a trip back"}
{"text":"Large portions of great food in a diner atmosphere filled with bears of all kinds. This place is as entertaining as it is delicious. The employees are polite and the music is upbeat."}
{"text":"I'll start with the positive. The staff is very friendly, always have a smile on their face. Also very attentive without being too \"in your face\". It's clean, bathrooms included.
Unfortunately the food wasnt good. My husbands steak was salty, not rare as ordered and gristle-y. My country fried steak was crispy on the outside but not fully cooked inside. Just generally something we did not care for. We didn't send back or complain, we were hungry and arent ones to complain anyway, but were disappointed. Although their biscuits and gravy are delicious! All things considered we personally agreed we wouldn't return. Im sure other items on the menu are great, but our experience today wasn't."}
{"text":"So I tried this place a couple of times before deciding to give it this review.  Which worked out well because it would have been just one star after my first visit.  

My first visit was well over a year ago - it took me that long to get over the experience to the point that I was willing to give it a second try.

It is cute and seems like it SHOULD be good.  Just a \"down home\" kind of feel with little country black bears everywhere.  

Our first time we sat forever before anyone came.  As we waited for our food we saw our waitress get into a confrontation with what appeared to be a manager or something and then the next thing we knew we saw her storm out of the diner crying.  We didn't really know what to think but after a while our food still hadn't come and our waitress was MIA.  So we asked someone about our order, then waited a long time again and finally got it.  I had a battered fish dish and became nauseated and sick later that evening.  My husband had the meatloaf, which was a 2 on a scale of 1-10.   And even after it became obvious to the staff that we didn't have a waitress anymore, they brought us the food and then never came back.  We had to hunt down someone to give us a check to be able to leave.

Gave it a second try recently.  The food didn't make me ill this time so that was a plus.  Our waitress didn't leave the building, also a vast improvement from the last time. But our wait for the food to come was pretty long and unfortunately it wasn't so great that you felt the wait was worth it.    But the food wasn't terrible, it just took a long time and wasn't that good.  Had the wait not been so long I might have even thrown in an extra star on this review."}
{"text":"A great place to eat with family and friends!  The food is good, the portions are generous and the atmosphere is a bit of country.  Highly recommend trying out this restaurant!  It's away from the busy strip and has a nice ambiance."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in Vegas. I feel so comfortable and welcomed by the older man every time I come here. He is always smiling. 

The food is excellent. Love their omelettes and hash browns. There is a usually a line but it goes pretty quick. The servers are efficient and attentive. Always a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend got an invitation to the private opening event. Basically the event 10/21/17 at 5:30pm was for the servers to practice before the restaurant actually opens. We got our whole entire meal comped including the drinks and a whole pie and a cookie that they were kind enough to give us. I have never been to a black bear diner so I did not know the portions were that big but I had no issue with it. It was one of the best dining experiences I have had in a very very long time. My coffee (yes I really ordered coffee at night) was never empty and we were checked up on by multiple people asking us how things were going. I would like to give some extra special recognition to Jae our server for being so kind. She really did take her time with us and make us feel very welcomed. She even told us that she would love to see us back in here soon. I believe she went above and beyond in her service. We were so full we could only eat 1/4 of our food. I would absolutely love to come back and I highly recommend anyone thinking about going here to do so. I promise you will not be disappointed. We sure were not! Thank you Jae for the wonderful experience and to all the others who's names I did not get. If you were there working at that time and date YOU WERE AWESOME"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this restaurant 3 stars because it's a hit and miss with this establishment. Sometimes when we go in its great but there are other times when you go in and the food seems to have been sitting there for a long time, or they can't even be bothered by putting a whole slice of cheese on a burger they throw shredded on the side. They just need consistency."}
{"text":"I stopped in with my daughter around 10:30 am on Thursday. They were busy. But it was not but a few minutes wait for a table. Friendly servers... Always smiling. Very efficient but of course the best part is the food! Portions overly generous. Tasty! I got the Bacon Scramble that was on special. It was excellent. Just the right amount of fresh delicious ingredients. I could not better myself at home. It was priced at $8.99 and well worth it with choices of potatoes and a bread or pancake. I got the biscuit and hashbrowns. Yum. My daughter had the two egg deal that came with a waffle . Would recommend this place to anyone for good down home cooking and great service. I've been to two locations. Both consistently GOOD!"}
{"text":"I have been graciously reminded by many people that a \"bruin\" is a kind of bear.

Sorry guys... I'm an AZ native (we don't have bears here in Phoenix) with the classic AZ school system education. :)"}
{"text":"What's up with the loud music???  The music made it difficult to talk with my partner who was sitting across the booth from me.  It reminded me more of music that should be in a 50's diner.  The service was slow and the food was inconsistent.  My country potatoes were plain; my partner's country potatoes had a large amount of onions 'thrown' on the top of them and even in the fruit that was ordered as a side."}
{"text":"This is the first time I'm writing about Black Bear. Their food can't be beat for the price and it's homemade! HOWEVER..I am writing this review in the booth of a local Denny's because yet again the service at black bear was bad. We stood and waited for a seat for about 7 minutes... With no one in front of us.. Only to be seated at a booth with the menus thrown on the table. We sit down and our waitress walks past several times... Finally she says \"I'll be with you soon\" and then proceeds to walk past us another 3 times... She didn't even take our drink order... We walk out, walking past her... And she couldn't even say anything as we walk past... It's sad because we really like the food but sadly we won't be back there. This happened twice--first time--shame on you... Second time.. Shame on me. There won't be a third."}
{"text":"Since I've heard so much hype about black bear, I decided to stop here for breakfast on Saturday. One word DISGUSTING! To start it took over 10 mins to be even approached by a server, after placing our order and receiving our food it was a total disappointment. Our hash Browns were completely still raw and the eggs were rubber! We brought this to the attention of the server and her response was \" let me try getting your food from the other cook station\" Um really? So you have a good cook station and a bad one? When we finally received our food back we had no appetite to even eat it. Paid the bill and left. Will never return."}
{"text":"They stick to their word....large portions great food...non expensive..great experience...i will definitely come back..u must try it..."}
{"text":"Wow, this was a fail on all levels.  I can't really understand all the glowing reviews.  The corned beef hash was so over-grilled that it was hard and chewy like jerky.  Underneath were a few good bites of hash but 80% of it was ruined.  Maybe I shouldn't have ordered hash at 4 in the afternoon? They do advertise breakfast all day but maybe the morning breakfast cooks handle it better.  HUGE disappointment.  The country potatoes were chunks of REALLY greasy potatoes sprinkled with some burnt onions.  Not caramelized or sauteed onions but actually black, incinerated, charred and inedible.  My over-medium eggs were over easy, very easy.  And the big biscuit was MICROWAVED and chewy, soggy.  Anybody who knows anything about biscuits knows not to microwave them.  

I've never been to a chain restaurant that served a great breakfast so I was a little leary about the yelp reviews.  But this turned out even worse than I could have expected.  For a good breakfast in Vegas I will stick to Maple Tree Cafe on Spring Valley and The Omelet House on Charleston."}
{"text":"I've eaten at several of these restaurants in various locations. This location, close to my house was tried for dinner. I found this location to be closer to the classic black bear diner motif. Other locations here in the Phoenix area feel like a standard diner very eclectic. When we arrived we are promptly seated and the waitress took our order for drinks and told us that there would be a little bit longer wait since the kitchen only had one cook.  
The one thing that I was impressed about was that the manager took it upon herself to go into the kitchen and help to Cook to get the food out to the customers waiting. The food order came within 20 minutes which was not extremely longer than you would normally expect in a restaurant such as this. The manager then walked around every table talking to every customer and ask him how things were going if everything was OK and really took The initiative to make sure everyone was satisfied.


Normally I would've given this restaurant three stars food was very good it was nourishing and well presented and tasty. But the fact the manager went out of her way to do what she did and everyone there was very friendly and cordial that game them next-door because it make dinner so much better."}
{"text":"Took my friend to eat there for her first time!! She loves the food as much as I do!! Thank you Judy (Judith?) for being so amazing and helpful! We totally appreciate her and her suggestions with the menu and how sweet she was! --we even ordered an extra entree to go because it sounded so good!! 
We'll be back soon and I hope our server is working when we do. --that tri-tip sandwich was so awesome! I ate everything on my plate!!"}
{"text":"I don't frequent chain restaurants very often, but on a recent trip to Arizona we gave the California based Black Bear Diner a try. I was extremely surprised at how good this place is. Everything we had was excellent. The Chicken Fried Steak is huge and delicious, and the real star of the evening was the Corned Beef Hash. The Hash was extremely flavorful, and the portions were very large as well. Overall a great place for a home-style meal in the Desert."}
{"text":"The food is no better than its counterpart, Denny's. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! Great service wonderful food! I had a burger and it was great. Had Apple crisp cobbler and omg I loved it! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food is good with Hugh portions. Service was bad we were left at the table for 10 min before even acknowledged by a server. Only refilled our drinks once and that was because we found a different server. I will come back but only because I like the food."}
{"text":"Love the breakfast here! Tastes like a home cooked meal.  Portions are huge! Usually have leftovers to take home, the prices are great, the servers are extremely friendly that give your great recommendations! Can't go wrong here for breakfast.  I pick this place over Denny's, ihop, and village in any day of the week!"}
{"text":"Always good food and service. My waitress, Cindy, is excellent ask for her at Sahara location."}
{"text":"Hands down! This place is my new fave! Omg if you haven't! Make sure it's on your bucket list to do! The food is next level amazing! My whole body was in a state of happiness food coma! Portion sizes are enormous & food is super tasty! My breakfast had me going all day! Customer service we received on our first visit was good. On visiting it today, Our host Anthony at the Tropicana ave Las Vegas black bear! Did a fantastic job of looking after our food & customer needs! Always went that extra mile! Thank you Anthony! You added so much happy rainbow shines to our day! Appreciate you! We need more of this totally a place to fill all your taste needs. Home style cooked food when your home away from home."}
{"text":"Like this place for breakfast but wouldn't go back for lunch.
I've been here several times and usually get good service.
Every time I've gone for lunch it's just been horrible...
Most people have an hour to get to lunch, eat and get back to work, like the people who come and have lunch with me. Not a good idea to come here! The food takes forever! Why do we wait 20-30 mins for sandwiches???? I don't get it.
The breakfast has always been good and I love their fresh squeezed orange juice! 
Cute little place. All the Bears around the restaurant are cute! The menus are cute too, like a newspaper!"}
{"text":"Superb service, excellent food, I have gone many times in one year, if you don't want to wait, suggesting of calling in and reserve, it's a popular diner, you can't go wrong with this place :)"}
{"text":"I was really happy to see that this former Chili's had finally been turned into something more than a vacant eyesore.  I recently stopped in for lunch, and I can definitely say that I'm a fan.

The restaurant is decorated quaintly, and definitely has that diner look and feel.  It's cute and the layout makes it appear fairly large.  Parking and access is easy.  The restaurant was clean and pretty busy during Friday lunchtime.  It does not look anything like its former self inside.

The menus are printed on newspaper, and both the adult and kids menus have lots of options.  The kids menu was full of really cool activities, so that's always a plus.  Breakfast is served all day, so you can't go wrong!

The portions are very large, and the food is super tasty.  I especially liked the homemade chips.  My husband was very impressed with the eggs benedict.

The staff seemed nice, but pretty rushed and a little disorganized.  Our waiter was friendly, but he mixed up quite a few things.  He was apologetic and helpful though, so maybe he's just new.

I will definitely be going back to this place to keep trying different menu options.  I am very impressed with everything considering it has only been open a few months."}
{"text":"Good food and quick service on a Saturday morning on our way back home to Wisconsin. The black bear hot sauces are great on the hash browns!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for thw forat time for breakfast. It's conveniently located on the south end of the Strip in the outlet shopping center. Our wait time was about twenty minutes which was pretty good for a saturday morning. The reataurant is so cutely decortated with cute black bears, very woodsy feel. We took a look at the menu and it was great, so many choices to make. Our server was Sandor, he was awesome, he was super attentive and met our needs with a smile and a courtesy that is very hard to find. The food was on point and delicious. Tasted very fresh and came out fast. Our breakfast experience was great and will definitely recommend Black Bear Diner a million times over. Thank You!"}
{"text":"I love the decor... Lots of little bears all around!! I had Portuguese sausage with eggs and hashbrowns I believe... The sausage comes out as a big ass link split down the center! I was like HOLY SHIET! It came out kind of blackened but I kind of like it that way! It was ALL good! AND HUGE portions! LOOOVE IT!"}
{"text":"The wait sucked....we waited an hour, this place was sooo busy but so was everyone else on a Sunday morning! The wait was worth it...the food was incredible and the waffle was soooo goooodddd! && the coffee was amazing too! The server forgot about us forever and explained it was because she was actually in a different section and she rocked the blue mascara!!! So overall the food was bomb! Great portions! You should definitely go! The menus were cool too! It's a newspaper. Make sure to not get it dirty so they can reuse them."}
{"text":"***Update: Second time was less impressive but still love this place.  Don't order their burgers as the meat is not good quality.  Tasted like a McDonalds patty.  Corned beef hash was so delicious but the tiniest portion in comparison to their other entrees.  Good thing the sides were bigger.***


For years I never cared to try this place assuming it would be like Denny's.  Because of Yelp, I decided to try one day when we were close by.  The wait was 2 hours so we couldn't stay.  I started thinking maybe there was something special.  We failed to eat there many times because we can't wait long with a baby. 

Today, we finally came early enough to only have to wait 10 minutes!  To my surprise, EVERYTHING tasted amazing and everyone enjoyed the experience.  This is one of those super-sized breakfast places that win my heart.  I got a vegetable scramble that had loads of spinach and other veggies, hash browns, a giant fluffy pancake, and a watermelon wedge.  I tasted my dad's pecan crusted trout and it was as good as one from any pricier New-American restaurant.  My husband got the turkey pesto sandwich that looked very substantial.  His homemade parmesan potato chips were amazing and not oily as far as homemade ones go.  To top off the great taste and giant portions, they were only $10.99 each.

Will be back!"}
{"text":"Have eaten at these restaurants at numerous locations. Great home cooked meals attentive and friendly wait staff. Good portions of food. Pies are the best part of the meal. All are made on site. You can eat Breakfast, lunch and dinner any time of day.  Entrees include pot roast, meatloaf, fish and spaghetti."}
{"text":"All is great at this Black Bear Diner. Mindy our sever was a pleasure. She was at the table regularly to fill glasses and check on our progress. The food was as expected, GREAT. Check the picture posted of my breakfast meal. A lot of food for the money. 

Watching the staff when not busy cleaning behind the counter was assuring of the cleanliness of the area.  Definitely the place to go for home style food."}
{"text":"This place is great to a family or an early morning snack. The staff here is very knowledgeable about their items in the menu and are very attentive. The food here is great and they offer a large variety of plates and appetizers to choose from. I love coming here in the morning. Although sometimes the wait time is really long. As to be expected with most places."}
{"text":"the burger has no seasoning. The fries are overcooked. place has a dirty feel to it"}
{"text":"We've been to a few Black Bear diners so visiting this one in Las Vegas was already a familiar setting. I believe it was very newly built so it doesn't have the same fun bear charm that some of the others have. There were four of us in for breakfast and we all decided to have the Huevos Ranchos. We also got a huge bear claw for something extra. Coffee all around completed our breakfast. The Rancheros was really very good and we all enjoyed it. It came with fresh fruit and country potatoes that really made the dish. The bear claw was a disappointment because they murdered it in the microwave! Really pissed me off because it turned hard within minutes and was extremely hot. Service wasn't bad but could have been much better."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere. I got the corn beef hash. The gravy and biscuits are delicious. I regret not tryin their dessert."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast!!! Probably the best biscuits I've ever had! The Corned Beef Hash and was dry, but had great flavor. The staff was very pleasant, and thoroughly efficient. My first time eating here, and I will definitely visit again, excited to try some of the other options!"}
{"text":"This restaurant offers large portions and a country feel log cabin feel environment.
Usually we go and sit at the diner, this experience was absolutely horrible!
It was so bad I Gave you 1 Star for large portions and the cool cabin decor.
First off, our waitress was so preoccupied with a regular it took her 10 mins to take our order drink and 30 mins to take our order not to mention my ice tea had hardly no ice and my sons orange juice was warm. We watched our food come up to the window and we watched as our waitress served her tables and left our plates sitting in the window I front of us. Gets worse, she finally serves our plates and my eggs are cold, toast is cold, my sausage patties (raw and under cooked) my sons biscuit and gravy cold, bacon cold! Now it took her 40 mins to place our order and longer to serve it. Her attitude sucked she catered to a regular who got his food hot! This was not enjoyable at all and the food sucked along with service.
The manager took one meal off, when he asked how was it today and I said don't even ask just cash me out. I won't be back to Black Bear for a very long time. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? Maybe i went on an off night or the food they purchased that day was not of their usual quality but i was so disappointed in all  aspects of this \"restaurant\". ordered the chicken parmigiana with a Caesar salad,right off the bat its a dinner salad with caesar dressing and oh we have no croutons.no croutons you are 2 minutes away from 2 supermarkets send somebody across the street and get a few boxes. meal comes and it looked like the chicken had been left outside on green valley pkwy and driven over a few times,old looking no taste and just bad. fries were cheap frozen variety and bad,spaghetti was fine if they messed that up they should just shut down. didn't receive my corn muffin and for all of this and a pepsi i am asked to fork over $20.. the entire drive home i kept telling myself dont get sick dont get sick.If this is the quality of food that regularly comes out of this place then they might as well do everybody a favor and close now and save the community from this abomination."}
{"text":"Breakfast was terrible. 
Potatoes undercooked and not seasoned at all. Salt and Pepper go a long way. 
The Vegetables in my scramble were undercooked as well - sauté the Vegi's guys!!! It's not hard. My biscuit was huge and tasty though. So many breakfast options in the area. I guess we chose the wrong spot"}
{"text":"Pros: great service
Food above average
Nice service sizes
Choice of in house hot sauces
Biscuits good but not the best I've had

Cons: country potatoes slightly over cooked
More omelette choices would be nice"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and I have wanted to try it based on recommendations from friends. Luckily, we got there just before they got real busy because they were extremely understaffed. People were getting angry with the long wait for their food which was not the fault of the waiters. Every single one of them were working their butts off!!! Even the guy seating people and running the register was cleaning tables in between customers with a smile on his face. I was very impressed with everyone of the staff. Mia was our waitress and she was outstanding! She always had a smile on her face even when people were getting upset with how long it was taking to get their food. She kept our drinks full and was right there when we needed something. Food was very good and I will definitely be back to try breakfast. Mia was excellent and hope I get her again!"}
{"text":"Las Vegas Tropicana location - If I could give this place 10 stars I would. Staff is amazing. Food is unbelievable! I now dream of the biscuits here. Not for the feint of heart, these biscuits are huuuge, buttery and delicious. We saved half a biscuit and some bacon for a snack later after hiking. The breakfast was great and we got a blackberry to go that was pretty amazing. I wish they would deliver to Florida."}
{"text":"GEEZ Can't your cooks make a poached egg with all their experience!!! I used to be able to order the eggs benedict and I had to ask the waitress to make sure the eggs are not overcooked. I usually got it ok when I asked but now once again I had overcooked eggs and had them make more only to not see any yolk in the new ones. 

Not sure if I should give you anymore chances???? It was last Sunday."}
{"text":"Steaks are always over cooked and service is bad. They never bring you any more to drink. The waitresses don't listen when you give your order. You ask for baked potato and they give you mashed. The desserts they ask for is cold even after they heat it up. We stayed at the motel and went there three times and had different waitresses and every time it was the same."}
{"text":"Alright, Black Bear! 

You finally got me to admit I'm a fan.

We recently went back with two friends from Tucson who'd been up for the day. I'm not sure what compelled us to go back- being that it's close to home, or you know.. our love of giant biscuits! 

Anyways, everything was good. The food was heavy as usual and hit the \"I need comfort food, and I need it now!\" spot. Our waitress might have been new, I'm not sure. 

We've never had her and I'm not sure she's ever been there when we were previously. She didn't smile much, but she did keep the glasses full. There was one time when someone mentioned she hadn't brought their biscuit and she told them, \"Oh! It must still just be in the microwave.\" 

We found that a bit strange to say, but microwave or not, that biscuit was eaten and enjoyed. 

We've since started diets (I think this is the #243rd one?), so we're not sure when we'll go back. We will though!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast, friendly staff. Be prepared to wait for a little but if you go on the weekends. The atmosphere feels like an old country diner which I love."}
{"text":"My family has been here a few times , but today was my first time here . Our waitress Kim was unbelievably rude . Not only with me but with all my little brothers and sisters . One of them asked for a refill and she had the nerve to say no tip no refill ! To a minor . She didn't even have the guts to tell that to us . All in all worst service from a waiter anywhere . I asked for crayons and she responded with an attitude and said if there isn't any on your table then there isn't any . My little sister asked a different waitress and she was kind enough to look first before responding and instead brought her a highlighter to use for the time being there . Worst service ever an she stayed talking bad about us to another waiter as we were leaving all with dirty looks . 2 stars for the food quality and the unknown waitress who brought the highlighter . Extremely disappointed. All in all bad vibes."}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner excels at breakfast. 4 or 5 stars easy for that.

This review is about the Friday all you can eat fish. Ok, they can call it all you can eat fish-sticks. Sure they are big, but they taste just as frozen as the fries and the coleslaw was that distinctive costco taste out of a bucket -- huh?

This is not the Black Bear Diner that I know, and I was at the original and many along the Northern California routes they are found.

I would not do this Friday Fish thing ever again, though I will return for breakfast, and expect to be vindicated by a massive plate full of the best freshly prepared good ingredient breakfast I could imagine getting there. Let's hope for the best!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome and plentiful. I don't usually take food to go or just leave food. In this case I did both. Prices were competitive with other places. The owner gave us a free dessert because of the wait which we never complained about, really didn't think it was that long. Nice place!"}
{"text":"Where do I start ! It was my first time coming here , my boyfriend and daughter came in on a Sunday morning & there was about a 20-30 min wait , I've always heard good things about this restaurant so we decided to stay , thank goodness we did , writing this review just makes me hungry all over again ! I do need to stop buy and try dinner . For breakfast I got biscuits and gravy with bacon and it came with hash browns & I also got orange juice which was freshly squeezed (yum)"}
{"text":"I have had several good dinners here in the past.  I was really hungry and thought I would treat myself to a ribeye steak. I should have stuck with the chicken fried steak.  The ribeye was maybe 1/4 inch thick and was cooked on a flat grill.  I ordered medium and got well done (hard to cook a thin steak to medium I guess.) Service was quick initially, got my order in, received my salad very fast, and dinner arrived while I was still finishing my salad.  
After that I didn't see the server for a tea refill for about 20 minutes, I was hungry so decided to just eat the overcooked streak. All of the other food items were good just a big disappointment with the steak.  I'll probably be back again for breakfast or the chicken fried steak, but won't be paying the extra dough $17.99  for a steak like that again, wouldn't even pay $5.  Desserts  have always been good here also."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food and the service is great as well. Great down home restaurant. I would renamed it. Would go back to try lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I have been to Black Bear Dinner in Medford Oregon when I went there for business and I liked it very much. Today my husband and I went for dinner at the Gilbert location and the food was good but the service was horrible. I was very disappointed.  The hostess sat us in a booth pretty quickly and was very polite.  She told us that our waiter was Jimmy and that he would be there to help us in the next few minutes.  Twenty minutes rolled by and the hostess came by to find out if Jimmy had gotten our drink order.  I had seen 2 other waiters in the area where we were since we sat down but no Jimmy. The hostess got us our drinks or I should say mine since my husband ordered a beer and she told us she was underage and couldn't serve. Jimmy finally showed up about 10 minutes later and we told him my husband ordered a beer.  He took our dinner order and brought my salad out but no beer for my husband. We reminded him and he left again and we didn't see him for about 10 more minutes and finally brought my husband his beer.  I asked that on my ribs to have the barbecue sauce on the side and not to put any more sauce on the ribs, I don't always like some types of barbecue sauce and my ribs came with the sauce on the side, but also all over the ribs.  My baked potato came in tin foil and that is okay, but there was so much foil from cutting it in my potato that I had scooped half of my potato out.  Did you ever bite down on tin foil? Not fun!!  We only saw Jimmy two other times.   Once he did refill my drink without me asking for more But we had to ask other wait staff to help us with things that Jimmy didn't get for us.  So here is the kicker when we finally got our bill the second beer that my husband asked for 20 minutes before we got our bill never came and the beer was on the bill.  My husband mentioned that he never got his beer and Jimmy stated \" I'm so confused tonight\"  Would we go back? Maybe as long as we don't get Jimmy!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We have always loved this restaurant, but it is so hit or miss. This last time was the last time. Service was terrible, my husbands chicken fried steak breakfast was burnt yet somehow managed to have stone cold gravy on it. The multi server approach to servers isn't working because no one could get a drink and or get the correct drink. 
My niece was visiting from out of town and we were embarrassed to have chosen this place."}
{"text":"WOW best breakfast ever! WARNING go there hungry the servings are over the top large, fresh and delicious. Ask for Bob as your server he's great!"}
{"text":"I stopped at the Black Bear Diner after flying in from Los Angeles to get a bite to eat. The food was salty, bland and watery."}
{"text":"The food was actually not too bad but the customer service of the actual server was pretty appalling when asked why the five top, 4 top and 2 top got fed before us. Literally stop the server and ask what happened? He slowly walked away and said he had to check on our food. Then we asked for the manager. It went well and she was kind and great customer service. Thanks for making our stay a little better and sending us home with brownies. Also she gave me a couple five dollar gift certificates to come again. Overall the food was a seven out of 10. Hopefully we get a different server."}
{"text":"The staff here is always so genuinely friendly and attentive. That is rare in this industry these days. Food is delicious and servings are generous."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place that finally opened in Laveen (it was about time).  Since it just opened, there service is a lil slow but overall with the weight. It's a lot better then IHOP too."}
{"text":"Great breakfasts with fresh ingredients and huge portions.  The California Benedict is exceptionally good, with avocados, spinach and hollandaise sauce.  Their sausage is homemade and absolutely delicious.  The hash-browns appear to be homemade too.  An excellent experience that we will repeat as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"Glad to finally be able to try this restaurant, it's new to the area and the long wait times are to be expected for freshly made meal. Especially for a Saturday. If you're in a rush, head over to Mickey D's.  
It took us only 25 minutes to be seated and we were told 35-40 mins. I'm sure the times will decrease with age, so I can't fault the restaurant for it. It seems they are running things smoothly. 
I enjoyed my pancake combo with hash browns and chicken sausage. You can tell it is made to order and the fresh squeezed orange juice was wonderful. Our server Brandon was delightful and he was very attentive as we waited for our food to arrive. Laveen is lucky to have a great option for a nice sit down meal!"}
{"text":"I have seen Black Bear Diners here and there but had never tried them before.
My loss.
Great food and friendly staff with excellent customer service. I liked that I could get lunch food for breakfast. The open face roast beef and potatoes was wonderful.
The pancakes were huge and fluffy.
It was so good our party had breakfast there two of the three days we were in Las Vegas.
The desserts displayed near the front counter looked wonderful but we were too stuffed to try them. The Bear Claw looks to be the size of a dinner plate."}
{"text":"Took me cousins from California to Black bear diner be enjoyed and told me it was a good choice to have breakfast Omelette for  breakfast and he had a biscuit that was huge he ate the whole thing he said it was the best please could you ever head because it was made from buttermilk I go there often for breakfast"}
{"text":"After a very long day that did NOT include lunch but did include a paltry breakfast, a flat tire and about 15 other things going wrong, stopping by this delicious diner was balm to a very exhausting day. The server was charming and consistently checked in on us. She refilled drinks regularly and accommodated requests to put in an order for my friends daughter as soon as we sat down, then coming back for our orders. 

Then there's the food... seriously it was worth every maple dripped calorie. The waffle was probably the best I've ever had even without the syrup! The eggs and bacon were cooked to perfection. My friend and her daughter also loved their meals. We need one of these in south Gilbert!! I might gain 10 lbs but it would ALMOST be worth it."}
{"text":"Best Place to have Breakfast in Vegas....they always serve you a meal fit for a bear... all the food is grate and the service is also awesome. definitely recommend"}
{"text":"The place is kitschy comfortable and our lovely server Cindie made it even more pleasant. We ordered and our food was ready fast. I had the chicken pot pie so I was surprised. It more than satisfies my comfort food craving. My mom had the chicken apple sausage omelet which she devoured. Overall, a yummy meal with a grandma's house charm."}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner is the best! And Mindy has given me the best service ever. I have travelled the world and no one has given service as good as Mindy!"}
{"text":"Staff seems great, but I've never been impressed with the food. Others swear by their burgers. Ugh. Guess I just need to keep trying new dishes until I find something I like"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by the place we're staying at and it was a good choice. 
Nice local diner, good food and great staff. 
This is the first time in Las Vegas and so far we are having a great experience."}
{"text":"This diner is one of the best! Our waitress was great! She took care of 4 adults and 4 babies (3 & under) with ease!
I ordered the Eggs Benedict and it was so good! You never know how the holandaise sauce is going to taste, but this restaurant nailed it!

Also, aside from the food, the restaurant is adorable with all the bear props and photo ops! Love it and will be returning!!!"}
{"text":"The big Bear breakfast and a side of hashbrowns!  Delicious and lots of food and pretty good prices.  The reason I didn't give a 5 is that the biscuits are dry and they don't give enough gravy.  The gravy was bland but I'm a southern girl and I expect lots of flavor from my biscuits and gravy.  The other reason is that the waitress was no where to be found, although friendly, we didn't get any drink refills of water or coffee until the meal was over and we grabbed her.  So I suggest someone to come around and just do drink refills for guests.  And add sausage to that gravy, give it some flavor!!!"}
{"text":"We are big Black Bear fans having eaten the original (Shasta, CA) several times. Good American show in big helpings. Almost any bear will get what and how much he she wants here. Today we had Broccoli Cheese soup (my wife said it was outstanding) and a Taco Salad. What made the salad unusual and to my liking is that it had no sour cream, or beans making this a very low cal but high taste dish."}
{"text":"Best diner that I've been to in Las Vegas.  Everything is reasonably priced and portions are huge.  Staff here are welcoming and friendly.  This will be my new breakfast spot whenever I visit Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I love BBD! As a cali native I've been to several, as we were leaving Las Vegas we wanted a good breakfast before heading back home. This BBD sucks ! The Service was lacking, but that necessarily wasn't the deal breaker, the food itself was. I always get the prime rib scramble, it had no flavor. The toast was super burnt, the steak was all fat and chewy, will not return to this location."}
{"text":"A group of us go to dinner together a couple of times a month.  So many times, it ends badly. (I'm sure it's hard to wait on 25 people all at once.). Well, Kimber at the Black Bear Diner is a Rock Star!  Her jokes may have made me groan, but she got all our orders right and the kitchen kept them rolling out.  Usually the worst part is getting the checks, and she did that part well, too. 
I had the hamburger steak with mashed potatoes and vegetables, and I saw other people's chicken fried steak, pot roast, and fish n chips.  Everything was delicious and the service was the very best we have had!  Thanks, Kimber."}
{"text":"The service here is always outstanding.  Very friendly and gracious servers every time we go.  I had a hot turkey sandwich and it was piping hot when it was served.  Delicious!  My husband had a patty melt which he said was excellent.  We always enjoy our dining experience at Black Bear Diner!"}
{"text":"OH YES !!!!! This restauarant comes out as our local favorite, we go every chance we can, both locations are fantastic with the Tropicana location close to our home and just a touch better, music was great , haha. Highly recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Trying our this new location for the first time with my wife. God Las Vegas has so much to offer. We are lovin life."}
{"text":"Well it's been two months and after the remodel we decided to stop in first day open . Once again not a disappointment, place looks great, clean updated. Waiting on our food now."}
{"text":"This review is not on the food. My friend and I walked into this establishment for breakfast and were greeted promptly by the host who informed us that the wait time was 20 minutes. No biggie. While waiting, there were several patrons who were walking out due to long wait times for service. Trash was being taken out the front entrance where general seating was located for those waiting on tables (great way to make someone lose their appetite). The floor looked like they had not been vacuumed or cleaned for days. We decided to opt out of trying out this new local diner for our neighborhood diner, Biscuits."}
{"text":"I love this place and wish it was close to me. We go when we are leaving town on the way to California and have never been disappointed. Service is always friendly and skilled. The food is good old fashioned  comfort food. Highly recommend this place. Breakfasts are great and have all the biscuit and gravy options as well as traditional breakfast fare."}
{"text":"My first time here. My family and I came off recommendation from my aunt who ate at the Signal Hill, CA location a few days ago. What a treat! Absolutely delicious food. Wonderful pancakes, wonderful service. Pleasant atmosphere. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Seems clean, and my husband and daughter loved their dishes, but mine was seriously lacking. I order the huevos rancheros eggs Benedict, it sounded great, and had the potential to be amazing, just poor execution. First the waiter got my order, and the two tables around me orders wrong. I asked for the regular sauce, and it came out smothered in the salsa sauce. The pulled pork was like eating newspaper and had a weird \"funk\" to it, the English muffin was soggy and had an odd consistency. The customer service was ok, but the servers need learn to listen. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I have ever had....period. The wait staff was on point and the decor was very charming and old school. I always get excited when the first thing i smell is frying bacon and fresh coffee. The wait was a little long, but when it's due to a packed restaurant full of smiling people it will always be worth the wait. Check this place out when your in the area, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This forrest theme diner donates proceeds of certain items on the menu to the National Parks... That is the number one reason I wanted to try the new spot out-- the diner meets all appetite needs while open serving: breakfast, lunch, and , dinner all day long. The staff is nice but the servers need more training on anticipating the needs of there guest, and checking in to make sure everything is going well at the table. The breakfast we ordered was very good and the portions are big enough for two. Something I found to be convenient was that there is also a little less section on menu which allows you to order smaller portions."}
{"text":"Had the best experience I've had in a while. Food was amazing staff was great friendly and on point, so attentive. Overall I give it 100% satisfaction. Will definitely be coming again ASAP!"}
{"text":"I had French toast and chix apple sausage. It wasn't good. The meat was tough and the French toast was bland and you can tell it's very commercial and they don't use quality ingredients. I didn't finish my meal. If you're used to quality food you won't like this place. I prefer local restaurants."}
{"text":"Why can't you get crisp bacon when you ask for it?  Four limp slices.  Toast was warm buttered bread.  Potatoes were good."}
{"text":"I would avoid this place if you want good, edible food. The quality and taste of the food here seems very cheap. I don't know if we just ordered the wrong stuff or what. But I think if you are a diner you should have good burgers, sandwiches, and breakfast. This place had none of that whatsoever. I would rather go to village inn or Denny's then this place and I think that says a lot."}
{"text":"I visited Black Bear Diner and was quickly seated. I was given ample time to review the menu. My server was very kind and explained menu items without hesitation. Their Eggs Benedict portion was huge. I really enjoyed my meal and will be back again for a homestyle meal and environment."}
{"text":"I was attending the Viva Las Vegas Rockabilly weekend and had an opportunity to have breakfast with friends and family also in town.  They chose the Black Bear as an alternative to a hotel/casino diner and I was glad for that.  It was Saturday morning and the place looked busy!  My timing was just right though, I got there first and was seated in a booth immediately.

I was greeted promptly by our server William who was bursting with energy it seemed!  He brought my coffee while I waited for my friends.  When the rest of my party arrived we were taken care of quickly and courteously by William, they also remarked on how friendly and chipper he was, which is what you hope to see at an American diner.

Food was great! And very reasonable, service was relatively quick considering how slammed the place was, and again our server William was excellent, he should get a raise!  Or a free day off or something!  Highly recommend and will repeat next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The morning after driving into Vegas at 4 am, we were a wreck, and I hadn't even started drinking yet. By 1 pm, I was looking for brunch/breakfast spot to revive myself by way of eggs, coffee, and cheese. Not in the mood to take a risk, we drove off-strip to Black Bear. 

Without a car, I would not attempt the trek here if you're not a local. It's not in the fanciest strip mall or in the best location, but the food is reliable and the service is friendly. I think of Black Bear as what I'm always expecting Denny's will be but isn't: Big servings, fresh food, fast service. 

Omelets, Chicken Fried Steak, and other plates range around $10 - and if you order a biscuit as your bread for any of those, you'll have invested in at least two meals; they're huge! 

Not the kind of place where I'd return to work my way through the menu, but in a moment of crisis, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. What great friendly service from everyone. Even the manger came by to see if everything was okay. Great selection if food and very good tasting. Will again soon."}
{"text":"Went looking for a chicken fried steak .... found alot of recommendations for it here and it was  good (average) but not extraordinary.  The food took at least 25 minutes to come out and was luke warm when it finally did. They definitly needed more servers it was a Sunday night with a few tables but no reason to have 2 tables walk out in the time we were there and 1 person to return their food. Pretty disappointed overall after all of the recommendations."}
{"text":"The Black Bear Diner is housed in the old Kukendutch on Jones and Tropicana and is a good, family friendly place.  Decorated like a mountain lodge, it serves up delicious, hearty fare at a reasonable price.  

The burgers are great, the blackberry cobbler is absolutely to die for, and kids go nuts for their happy fries.  (Those are fries in the shape of a happy face - who wouldn't go nuts for them?)  For a neighborhood restaurant, it doesn't get much better than this.

The waitresses can be a little inattentive and the service a bit slow at time which is the only thing that detracts from this awesome little hole in the wall."}
{"text":"They need to improve their pick up system. This is the second time I've gone in, fully paid for food in hopes to grab it and be on my way. The system is so jacked up that if you don't push your way up to the front the employees will assist everyone but you. A line would help or maybe someone who doesn't consistently leave the cashier unattended. Step up your customer service black bear diner!

P.S. Thanks for the cold food."}
{"text":"Our first visit to this little gem.  Huge menu, lots of choices to satisfy anyone. If you're not a breakfast person that's ok. They serve the entire menu all day long.
Our server recommended the sweet cream pancakes and the chicken fried steak. Done!  And boy was she right.  They were EXACTLY as described.  

The chicken fried steak was crispy yet fork tender.  Seasoned perfectly and covered with a perfect amount of white gravy.

The pancakes were AMAZING! Sweet, tender, and perfect plain.  I've never eaten an entire plate of pancakes without butter or syrup, until this morning. 

Can't wait to come back. Too bad we are only here once a year but my waistline might thank me for it."}
{"text":"Just amazing meal. Fried chicken - great, salads - large, sandwiches - so fresh and tasty. Service is the tops. Place is so packed, but service was spot on. Home cooking at it's best!!!! Great diner with great atmosphere. Wish they had more Black Bear Diners in Las Vegas. Even have great desserts."}
{"text":"Solid choice for breakfast.  I've been here a few times now and always been pleased with my food.  Service could be better but it's sufficient for a diner type spot.  Hubby likes the Sweet Cream Pancakes and Chicken Fried Steak.  I like the Portuguese Linguica Sausage, which I don't see much in Vegas and the Bear Claw French Toast.  Portions are large so come hungry.  Desserts are good too.  They have little mini pies and cobblers for about $6.  We took home a Blackbeary Cobbler and it was awesome.

Sign up for their E-Club and get a free breakfast for your birthday."}
{"text":"This location is miles ahead of other locations I've been to. We were in the mood for diner food and it's exactly what we got. It was hot, crispy and plentiful.  The service was absolutely awesome!"}
{"text":"Bread had mold on it and they kept bringing me sweet tea when I ordered unsweetened tea. After the 4th time, I asked for water. I rarely send food back but ugh!

We decided to try again. This time they forgot to put in our order while the waitress chatted with all the other coworkers. When she realized she forgot to put in the order she didn't bother to tell us.   After 40 minutes of trying to get her attention she finally came to the table and told us what happened. I asked for the check to pay for the drinks as I was on a time crunch and she got really snotty and said \"Well, I'm not going to have you pay for food you didn't get.\"  My reply was that I would like to pay for our drinks and leave and she said, again rudely, that it would be no charge. 

Again, I rarely send food back, I generally am very understanding and forgiving of human error, but both visits made me think that customer service training is needed at this establishment along with common courtesy. 

Not going to try again. If I could give 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"My Mothers Day Experience here was very disappointing. Our server was very uptight, unfriendly and not very customer oriented. I feel bad because my sisters and I talked it up to the rest of our large group, after our wonderful experience (because of our server) in Bullhead City, and it was a flop. Server was less than mediocre and food was still cold internally. 
My sisters and I have determined that this visit has pretty much determined Black Bear Diners existence for future dining options.
However I will make the exception when in Bullhead City."}
{"text":"Pancakes, waffles are good because of the cake mix in the batter. Chicken and waffles not that good. Will stick with the basics."}
{"text":"good stuff!!!

place was packed and the service was very good!

really good pancackes!"}
{"text":"This is great restaurant! I really enjoy it, and they know how to keep a customer happy. My favorite is the chicken avocado club sandwich!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome 
Delicious food 
Great service 
Amazing atmosphere 
Good music 
Great place for family and children"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for late breakfast on our way out of Vegas back to California this morning. We were blessed to have gotten 2 seats at the counter rather quickly and boy, am I glad we did! We were so impressed at the front line staff's attention to detail as meals came out of the kitchen. They were a finely tuned machine. From the runners to the servers, and the manager who was in the trenches with his staff - they were efficient, calm yet assertive, and they all seemed to really enjoy working together. This was my first time in Vegas - but not my first time at a Black Bear (normally only occasionally eat here as I am eating healthy) and this will be our regular stop on the way in and out of Vegas. Well done! Also happy to see more fit friendly choices. Everything was delicious! One warning: watching all those pancakes and biscuits coming out is not easy when you're trying to eat lighter - everything looks great! Did have a bite of my husband's spicy sausage patty and it was super yummy!"}
{"text":"First time at Black Bear Diner and Marlene was wonderful helping us through the menu. The chicken strips were a tad bit over done which led to dry chicken but everything else (chicken enchiladas, fish n chips, kids cheeseburger) were all yummy. As a welcome gift, Marlene gave us a dessert of our choice and ice cream sundaes to the children too. Thanks for the pleasant experience!!"}
{"text":"Huge portions! This is our favorite breakfast restaurant when we come out to Vegas. The service on average is great and one or two of their servers really are out-of-this-world awesome. One of our servers recommended the huevos rancheros with over medium eggs this last time and I couldn't agree more! Fresh squeezed orange juice and coffee, I'm in heaven! Every meal I have had here has been awesome but their breakfasts make me wish flights to the west coast were cheaper."}
{"text":"All black bear  restaurants are #1 for breakfast. Never pass up a great meal!!!"}
{"text":"Checked out this restaurant this morning for breakfast with the family after seeing such great reviews. We were seated quickly but waited longer than usual to place our order. My husband always asks for his hash browns to be well done, they were not. My water and toast tasted strange and my sons pancakes were mushy as was my fruit. I will not be returning or recommend the Black Bear Diner."}
{"text":"Just had the navy bean soup, horrible!!!  I've been here before, the food is usually always great."}
{"text":"Really digging this new place booboo. Not only is it great to see that they turned that vacant building into something, the place has pretty damn good food as well. I have visited this spot twice and both times left with a full stomach and a whimsical grin, contemplating the next time i will visit again. My first time there I was quite the hungry beast so I opted for the ribs, got a full rack a salad, 2 sides, biscuits and a drink for $15. 2nd visit Grabbed one of their amazing burgers which was a beast, had to flatten it in order to chow down. The staff up front is very helpful and greets you promptly while entering the door. The waitresses I had for both visits were top notch, always making sure I was supplied with ample amounts of food and beverage. They use quality ingredients, the salads are made fresh daily, the fruit is always ripe and Delicious. They have their own bbq and hot sauce which is pretty good.Give this spot a try if you are in the area and want some good eats for a good price."}
{"text":"Food mostly excellent wait staff excellent cashier excellent gave 4 instead of 5 stars because the normal amazing pancakes wasn't so amazing"}
{"text":"Hello my name is Larry and I am an eggs Benedict snob....hi Larry... No disrespect to the 12 step crowd. 

One of the worst Benedicts I have ever had. 

I ordered the California something arouther Benedict with avocado, bacon and tomato. EVERY single component of this meal was the same or very close to the same texture. Soggy English muffin, soft avocado, soft bacon, grilled(???) and therefore mushy tomato with an over poached egg. Hollandaise was nothing to yelp home about. They do have a list of \"mantras\" or something on their menu and #4 encourages ordering the food specifically to your taste so if I do go back in (not going to happen) I would ask the English muffin to be toasted and crispy, the bacon to be crispy and the tomato to NOT be grilled. This would offset the avocado, egg and hollandaise sauce and likely make a fantastic breakfast, well aside from the giant loogie under the poached egg I would undoubtedly get for being so picky. 

Seriously! Does every breakfast place in AZ peak out at average? I have yet to be impressed, even by the ones with relatively good reviews. If I win the lottery I am starting a quality breakfast joint in the valley. 

My server Paula was nice, the seats were classic beat down unconfortable seats."}
{"text":"Food was great but even better was the staff. They all were attentive and worked together very well with a great attitude. I recommend this place and will be back when in the area."}
{"text":"Breakfast before a great round of golf. Tonya aka gravy girl, was on top of her game, nice, friendly, and knowledgeable of everything on the menu. Tonya is one of the best waitresses I have seen and I'm very glad we sat and got to experience this service that she brings to the industry. Big bear diner keep up with the good service and great food."}
{"text":"It was my first time here. Service was awesome food was great. I had NEW! Bear claw French Toast.
My friend had chicken fingers they were nice too!"}
{"text":"My first review was a 5 star but after a second and third visit I am changing my review to 3 stars. One reason is the fish and chips is frozen fish patties and not very good ones at that and the second reason is because the staff do not know the difference between blueberries and raspberries. My husband and I went there tonight for dinner and decided to get the cobbler. We asked the person at the counter if it was blueberry and she asked someone else who said yes and it was really good. Brought it home and not blueberry and not that great. Could use some more fruit and ditch the tough crust and make it either a pie or a real cobbler."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Black Bear.  Overall the food was good.  I had the breakfast burrito and my wife had the hobo omelet.  The burrito was very tasty and even though I added hot sauce, it was fine plain.  It had chorizo sausage, jalapeños, refried beans, etc.  Yummy!  I just wish the burrito was a bit bigger.

My wife's omelet was also very good and the side potatoes were delicious.  The huge biscuit looked good but ended up being dry.  Even with jelly she couldn't eat more than a few bites.

This is their newer location and it is very nice.  It has a good homey and family friendly feel to it.  Their menu has lots of items so there should be something for everyone.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how to rate the diner. So my friend raves about this place so figured take my youngin and check it out for breakfast. Arrived abt 10, seated at 10:15, waiting for abt 10 min for a waitress to take out drink order and we ordered a bear claw right away, thankfully. When Shae brought the claw she took our order. We did not get our food for almost 45 minutes! They were obviously struggling. I ordered a biscuit and gravy, one egg and bacon and was really disappointed In the gravy.  Don't expect sausage. My youngest ordered French toast, eggs and bacon. Nothing special. The eggs were cooked to order and the bacon was almost crispy. So it's just okay. Pricing was fair. When we went to pay the manager told us that she is really short staffed. Folks not showing up to work which could mean just about anything. It's a chain restaurant and won't last for long if they don't figure it out. We may return to check out dinner cause they have meatloaf and my other daughter loves meatloaf lol. Otherwise wish them luck!"}
{"text":"Visited a few days ago around 11:00. Ordered scrambled eggs with spinach, etc.  food was lukewarm...biscuit was dry..friend ordered either the Ruben or corned beef...bread was thisclose to being more than burnt..since the chips he got with sandwich were nice and fresh we decided our other food sat around waiting for chips...2 stars because the coffee is good...when server asked how things were we told her and she offered to remake but we had already waited long enough we told her not to bother...I had visited couple months earlier and not impressed then..."}
{"text":"We want there on Christmas  the dinner was bit limited but so yummy. Everything is home made. My husband ordered the chicken fried steak. I had a bite and wanted to take the whole thing!!
Orders are huge. The staff is very nice."}
{"text":"Sunday early am, after dropping family at the airport looking for a breakfast place that is open so early (6:30).  I have been waiting to try Bear diner, we were greeted warmly by our server Beatriz, this time of day pick your own table.  
Server pointed out the big griz breakfast special (?). Tons of food, wish she had pointed out the lighter portions available. Biscuits are huge and fluffy.
All in all it was a great visit, will come back for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This was more of a local diner. I had pancakes, eggs and toast. He had biscuits and gravy with an egg on top. Both of our plates were pretty much  empty. The pancakes are super sweet. I really needed something salty after eating them but they were tasty nonetheless!"}
{"text":"One and done! Went there for the first time for breakfast today. Walking in the front door gave me the impression of a good country diner. Clean. Friendly staff. Hence the one star.

It stopped there. Ordering was fairly easy on the cute newspaper style menus. The very friendly waitress took our order, no problem,  but out of tomato juice. Ordered the Big Bear breakfast with biscuits and gravy, two eggs over light and bacon. Wife ordered egg whites, hash browns, and rye toast. Large OJ to split. No tomato juice remember. 

Breakfast is served! First words from my wife, \" my food is cold.\" Asked for the waitress. By the time she took my wife's food back I was into the middle of one of the huge biscuits, and it was cold. Manager took mine back and brought another. Asked for OJ. Forgot it. Had to make fresh batch. Much hotter. I was able to eat about 1/2 of it. Biscuits so heavy you could anchor a boat with them.

Manager offered to buy our breakfast . Good. 
Gave a tip for kindness. Done. Gone.C-ya."}
{"text":"I stopped here on the way out of Vegas only with a little bit of money left. My order came out quickly and was delicious. The price was very reasonable and I had enough left over to take a pie home with me. I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"We came in for breakfast and were treated to some very good food. My wife had her usual which is basted medium eggs, bacon and hashbrowns. She said it ranked right up there with our favorite place at home. I had Joe's Hobo Omelet with hashbrowns. It had ham, bacon, sausage, 2 types of cheese, spinach and onions in it. It was really good. My daughter had the French toast with a side of bacon. Also very good. One of there signature items is a gigantic buttermilk biscuit with you breakfast instead of toast. It was one of the best I had ever had. 

The service here is very good. The place including the bathrooms are clean and the decor was really cool. A solid choice for breakfast or lunch. Also be aware that the menu is much larger than what is shown on the website. I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about this place. Food was sooooo good and very filling. I've declared their biscuits and gravy thee best in Vegas! The decor is very cute and I asked the sweet waitress if I could buy a menu because it had my mom's birth year on it and she went to get me a better one and said I could have it! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service made it. Thanks from a Vegas bachelor who realized he had no plans at 7PM."}
{"text":"15 minute wait to get in isnt bad at all for a Sunday morning..big portions which is good for the guys. .awesome cheap prices for the amount of food that is served.  I chose the denver omelette with a side of fruit and wheat toast. MmmmMmmm..perfect mix of onions.bell peppers. And cheese. .delicious.  You gotta come try it. .it looks a lil wierd outside but oh well.  The food is goood! !"}
{"text":"This is one if my spots ... when I lived across the street!! I have since moved and I do miss this place breakfast was always good and I love fresh squeezed OJ!!!"}
{"text":"I usually enjoy this restaurant, but as of lately, the service seems to have really gone downhill.  On my wife and I's last outing, we placed our orders and the waitress kept forgetting our drinks. They didn't show until after the appetizer and salads had been delivered.  Needless to say, refills seemed to be out of the question.  The waitress also brought the wrong meal out for my wife.  While they did eventually bring the right one, she was left waiting while everyone else was eating.  After this happened, we didn't see our waitress at our table the rest of the night.  Every time she came near, she would avoid all eye contact with us.  I tend to tip at least 20% whereever I dine out, but this is one of the few instances where I definitely left nothing for our server.  The food is great, but good, even decent service has be to there, otherwise its not worth going out."}
{"text":"Service was amazing! I believe her name was Cynthia. It was our first time there and she told us all about them menu and recommended a few things. Breakfast, Lunch, and dinner all day! The prices were pretty average considering most dinners now a days are over $10, my turkey dinner was $11.99 came with mashed potatoes and mixed veggies. Portions are huge! I barely ate half. So I'll be having leftovers! They were out of ribs, which was a bummer, but I guess it wasn't a huge inconvenience because we will definitely be back. Not to mention the dessert counter looked so good. Little blackberry cobble was $4.99 or $5.99 with ice cream. I will save room for that next time!"}
{"text":"We visited Black Bear diner with my mom yesterday and it was one of the best experiences we've had! Our server Cindy was incredible!! Sweet personality, helped us numerous times even though we were indesicive. Amazing psotive vibe from her... The menu was incredible, food delicious and incredible quality, restaurant very clean, and organized. I spoke to the supervisor to let him know of our great experience and he was so down to earth, shook our hands was extremely grateful as were we, and gave us a free dessert for the positive comments we left. The restaurant overall is our new go to place and I feel thankful for the amazing people that work there.  you all are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Okay, I allowed another person to leave a response to my review. I did this in the interest of fairness. However, I was not alone when I witness this and nobody I was with saw this as a joke. I cannot verify the validity of this other person or their experience, not even to the extent that I can say that they were there when I was. But I do believe that everybody deserves a second chance, and I do believe everybody should be fair, so I allowed them to post their response in good faith , as a human"}
{"text":"Delicious home cooked meals right here with a generous amount of food! This is my second time here and it is amazing. 

Service is great, food is great and the restaurant is clean! Menus are on what looks like a newspaper and there are bears all over the place (hence the name black bear diner) definitely will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Impressive! I was actually pleasantly surprised with the food quality and size portions we were served. My husband wanted breakfast at 3pm and found with Black Bear Diner while visiting Las Vegas. We wanted something off the strip. My husband ordered the bacon breakfast and I had the chicken club. Besides the food being amazing the service was terrific! Marlene was awesome and made us feel welcome especially for being first timers! We definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for the reviews and word of mouth. As usual for a new restaurant the wait wasn't that bad (25min) at 9am arrival. My husband got the hobo omelet with hash browns and biscuit and I had the corned beef with hash browns and English muffin. Portions were huge, food was good. The only down fall of this first time experience was:
1. Waitress (Trina) some what came only once to check on us and what we didn't appreciate was getting the bill just 3 minutes from getting our food. I understand it's busy but at least give us some time to enjoy the meal.
2. On the other hand another waitress (Tori) was a LIFESAVER, she came around with refills for coffee and asked if we're doing ok. She went above and beyond to even get the manager since the corned beef that I ordered was overwhelmed with whole pepper corn. I can say the corn beef could've tasted better without the significant amount of it. 
3. Thank you to the manager that comp the corn beef and tried to accommodate me with another dish.  GOOD customer service for that.  But I suggest Trina need more training on waitress skills or ask Tori for some pointers.
I will give this restaurant another try since it's still new."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Las Vegas. The food is great and the service is always good but today we we're sitting in Amber station and I just have to say she is a true asset to your company. She was very friendly outgoing and greeted with us smile. She introduced herself welcomed us asked if we've eaten there before and told us about the daily specials checked on us throughout our meal always with a smile on her face."}
{"text":"My Mom and I stopped in for a nice dinner after a movie.  She raved about their pot roast dinner, very juicy and loved the buttermilk roll.  I had the avocado, grilled chicken breast sandwich less the bacon and with a side green salad.  I loved the spice and herbs on the chicken breast.  We enjoyed our server, Mindy, who was very personable and attentive - thank you!  I passed on the deserts when you pay but will get a a brownie that looked great next time!  Great food here always."}
{"text":"I have been to Black Bear Diner for many years in Las Vegas as well as other locations. Perfect brunch spot after a long night on the strip. Bigfoot chicken fried steak and eggs is the best hangover cure and only $12.99 so it's a bargain.

This is mostly a local place, so expect a lot of locals, but it's one of the best places to know off the strip. Highly recommend Black Bear for anyone in Vegas. Just travel west on Tropicana Ave past Jones Ave and it's directly on the right in the shopping center."}
{"text":"Very good place to go for breakfast..all the times I have been (about 7) I have had good customer service and the food is above average.  The only 'issue' that I might mention is the prices are a little high for breakfast food..but it's mostly worth it."}
{"text":"I have been here three times and three strikes your out. I actually came here just for the sausage cause its the best however the afternoon service is horrid. Hash browns or any kind of potato is never cooked all the way. The bacon is fatty and soft instead of firm and crunchy again not cooked long enough which I could really deal with actually, its fine. The main reason I wont go back is the cooking staff doesn't know how to work together. Each three times I have been here I have seen plates up for pickup for 20+ minutes because the cooks don't know how to prioritize what they make first to last so the food is always waiting while the thing that takes the longest is still being made. Instead of making what takes the longest first and then the others so that everything can be put on plate at one time and not get cold they have it backwards and everything gets cold. My daughters food came out 15 minutes after ours so while she waited she ate our side of sausage so we didn't end up getting a side. We asked for sunny up for her and got scrambled. We spoke with the manager and he said yes we have problems with them with the potatoes in the past but then is condescending and says that he doesn't have a problem with his staff and have never gotten a complaint. Well I just did and others must have too if he said initially that he had problems with people returning the potatoes. He said well yea with an attitude , it takes about 25 min to get your food. Again he's not understanding its not the wait time. Its the time over half the food is sitting up there getting cold while the other piece of food is still being made. A good cook knows how to get things out in a prioritized manner. I wont be going back. I also would like to mention that the server was great , although she got the sunny side up/ scrambled egg mixed up she was better than the manager at communicating and understanding the needs that were not being met by most of the people who get served. She understood, why couldn't he? She was more of a professional."}
{"text":"I would give this place 6 stars if I could. We first tried the Black Bear Diner chain this summer when vacationing in Boise, ID. We noticed there was a Black Bear here in Phoenix and decided to give it a try. We were impressed all around. The atmosphere is great with good decor for families. The food is fantastic. I had the Grizz which had large portions and my family dabbled in pancakes and French toast. Zero complaints around the table. Their breakfast meats.. sausage, bacon and ham were all incredible. Sometimes the meats are a make or break side for breakfast places, but Black Bear has perfected them. This breakfast experience was probably the best service I have ever experienced at a restaurant. Alexander The Great was my server and he was incredible with a huge smile and beyond perfect service. Thank you so much Black Bear. You have earned a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"I ate so much even my fat rolls hurt . Great biscuits ! Awesome food here and huge portions. There's a good reason why this place is always busy. Even packed Sunday night. Tarah or Thara  , our waitress was awesome. Everyone there runs their butts off. Great service fantastic food :. Chicken fried steak, B&G, pancakes, BLT sandwich or even believe it or not a great taco salad . Been here before and I'll be going back . Spotlessly clean restaurant too"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend from high school before seeing the movie Mike & Dave Need Wedding Dates at Galaxy Theatre around the corner this past summer. I had a burger and fries and a milkshake while my friend had the clam chowder. Despite being full from the food, that didn't stop us from ordering more food at the theater!
I'd definitely come back to this diner on any occasion."}
{"text":"Nothing says down home cooking like decorating your restaurant to match the namesake's theme. I loved walking in and seeing bears EVERYWHERE! My first thought was how much I wanted to bring my 2 year old niece here.

We were seated right away, even though it looked really busy, and the food came out in great timing. I loved how friendly the staff were. They seemed to be an eclectic bunch who were really positive and friendly--something that can be difficult to do during the busy times of the day. And our server even sold us on getting the blackbeary cobbler because she was willing to take the time and talk to us. It was delicious, btw.

Overall, if I am hankering for some good diner grub, this is definitely towards the top of the list of places to go!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here. Their breakfast is amazing. My only complaint is that everytime we have come they are short staffed and things take longer than they should. We continue to go because their breakfast has never disappointed us."}
{"text":"Soooo yummy!! Great service, good prices. Very attentive to their customers. My first time here n I was impressed n will be back! Thank u!!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit. The service was quick.  I was disappointed with the pancake menu as they did not have a huge selection of flavors. We had eggs, pancakes and the open faced turkey sandwich. The pancakes were temperature hot. The bacon and eggs could have been hotter. The turkey portion was satisfying and good."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Black Bear Cafe several times in past. Normally the food is delicious, and the service is very good. This most recent time, the service was poor. We sat at a circle top this time, which was great and what we asked for; however, the server never came by to check on us. We sat there with an empty coffee and soda cup and in need of syrup for 20 minutes. We finally had to ask another server. Very disappointed. We hope the next time will be better."}
{"text":"The food - fabulous. Huge portions with low prices. Awesome pancakes. 
The decor - freakin adorable. Who doesn't love a cabin feel with black bears?
The service - Marlene was the best part of my dinner tonight. Sweetest woman. Ask for her while you are there so she can tell you about her trick for reheating leftover food! - She's a keeper!"}
{"text":"Can't really go wrong with this place. Food is good, was surprised to find out they have close to 70 locations. It shows in some of the food items. They are mass produced and honestly lack in the \"homemade\" taste you would expect anything labeled a \"diner\".

Daughter had the Chicken Parm, $13 - she was trying to convince herself that it was really really good, but from the looks of it it fit on the plate to nicely. Would rather see the chicken hanging half off the plate and spaghetti sauce dripping from the plate, you know rustic diner food, this dish fit on the the plate perfectly, the chicken was perfectly shaped and the spaghetti sauce kind of watery. the cheese on top of the parm looked like a picture right off a banquet tv dinner box. Meh.....

My little guy had the 6oz ny steak off the kids menu. For $7 was a deal, he said the steak was good, didn't touch the veggies. Ate the mash potatoes.

This is where the word \"diner\" should be removed from the Black Bear. They don't make their own mashed taters and the brown gravy tasted just like was power and water stirred till thick, total disgrace. With the mashed potatoes they did try to fool you by having a chunk of potato every 3rd bite. These babies tasted like 6th grade lunchroom taters. What a shame.

Cost $50 for the four of us, not bad, would only go back for breakfast though, you almost have to do that homemade. Well see."}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast, and although I didn't have any other meals there, I have a feeling all their food is great.  I ordered a breakfast meal of scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, and sweet cream pancakes. Everything was cooked perfectly.  The pancakes were big and fluffy with a hint of sweet cream flavor.  My only regret is we didn't get another chance to eat here while visiting.  They do have locations in other states, but not Florida."}
{"text":"A new favorite breakfast spot of ours. It's been here forever and we've never been. But their pancakes are super yummy. The rest of the breakfast food is nothing special but the pancakes are delicious. Kids breakfast portion for the scrambler is pretty good too. And if your child brings a bear with them on tuesday, they eat free."}
{"text":"I write this review purely on their breakfast options. I have never tried lunch or dinner options. They have hands down the best omelets in Las Vegas. I have tried other breakfast options which are good but the omelets keep me coming back. They are that good. The cook is nearly always excellent and delivers the best tasting omelets and hash browns.  I switch between wheat and sourdough toast. I have opted for the fresh fruit before but they tend to put flavor full fruit on top of rind flavored fruit chunks. Flower (hostess?) and Marlene to me are the power duo. I have always had good , prompt and friendly service here but those two are the shining stars in my opinion. There are bear decorations all over the place and a jukebox kicking out older tunes . A very home cooked meal and small cafe feel kind of place. I was shocked to find out it was a chain since everything seemed to perfect to be a chain. The pies and shakes are the only other items I have tried (to go) and they are quiet flavorful. They are about the size of a Marie Calendars pot pie but filled with sweet tooth goodness. I only wish they would have a Peach Cobbler that wasn't flavored with splenda as I despise fake sugars.  The other cobblers (Apple, Blackberry ) were very good. They also have Banana, Chocolate and Coconut creme pies if that is more your style. The Cinnamon rolls are massive and look very tempting  but I am always so  haven't tried one yet. Totally worth a trip across town for."}
{"text":"Hands down the best diner in the USA. 

Portions are huge. Senior citizens should plan on sharing these huge breakfast platters. My order was the basic two eggs , sausage patty, red potato home fries. Here is where the meal gets better. The counter has a foot riser the likes I've never experienced before. It helped relax my back so the meal could be enjoyed. Great flavor, love the cumin in the sausage (Italian style) eggs were perfect over medium. Served in less than ten minutes! Black bear has a great order control system so I expect other diners to be challenged keeping up with this customer service challenge!!!

Highly recommended for breakfast!

No, I could not finish my plate. Awesome awesome awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Pros:
Server Brittney was awesome, I will come back and request her!
Chicken fried steak is soooo good, I don't think ill ever order anything else.
Bathrooms are clean.
Wait time isn't long at all.

Cons:
Location. I wish there was a location closer by me in Henderson. 
Mixed veggies should be taken off the menu, they have a bitter taste to them."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place, it's a small town diner feel that is welcoming. We come here often on weekends during the rush, usually take a seat at counter. The servers are all super nice and take very good care of us. They have very generous servings and it's all very good."}
{"text":"This place is super cute, everything about it. From the \"newspaper menu\" to the paw prints on the napkins and place, to the cozy setting, is absolutely perfect. Went here for breakfast on a busy Sunday, but didn't wait as long as we gaged from the business of the restaurant for our food. Our server didnt check on us after we got our food, but it wasn't that big of a deal. We were content, just could've used more than one napkin because of the syrup. We got fresh squeezed OJ, the way orange juice should be for a breakfast place, cinnamon roll French toast, and chicken and waffles. That  cinnamon roll French toast- DELISH! Melt in your mouth and definitely a game changer. As for the chicken and waffles, the breading on the chicken was outstanding. The waffles weren't too soft but not too crunchy, so a perfect combo with the chicken. All in all, this was a great experience and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Service was slow.  We ordered our drinks and then the server came back to take our meal oder before bringing our drinks.  I ordered the pot pie and took one bite and the center was ice cold.  Had a club swndwhich after that cause you can't really screw that up.  Not missing anything here folks."}
{"text":"We went to their exclusive pre-opening event and it was wonderful! This is the newest location in Arizona, right off of Elliot and Priest. The decor is reminiscent of a lodge in the woods. When you sit down, they hand you little newspapers. The newspapers are actually the menus which is a cute little touch. We went around noon, so we were trying to decide between breakfast and lunch. I finally settled on the California Bacon Eggs Benedict. My husband ordered the Cheeseburger salad and oh my goodness, it was huge. One thing I should warn you, the servings are huge! So either bring a huge appetite or share that meal. We both had leftovers from that meal. I actually thoroughly enjoyed my Eggs Benedict. There was hollandaise sauce over poached eggs on top of an English muffin, on top of avocado and tomato. I also got a side of hash browns with it. Overall, the experience was great and I think this will be a new breakfast spot in the future. Plus the prices are reasonable!"}
{"text":"This place another one my brother recommended that he had eaten for years. His fav tri tip dip he had for one yr straight, a testimonial in itself! This is a great, inexpensive old school diner restaurant. The salads are awesome, my sister (I've had it too) enjoyed the grilled southwest steak salad, gigantic with a great chipotle ranch dressing. I had the reuben sandwich which was very good quality pastrami (made homemade and their corn beef as well) and tons of great skin on fries. The blackberry cobbler not too sweet, the crust yummy. Try it for a change from the chains..!"}
{"text":"Staff at Goodyear, AZ location very friendly and the food is always plentiful and hot. If you're lucky you might get your eye-candy fix with Sexi Lexi as your waitress..."}
{"text":"I have honestly never been too such a great diner! 
The fact that this place just reminded me of a diner back in big bear just made me so happy. The food was amazing the waiter 'Monika' made it so much more pleasant. I could come here everyday. The food was served in big portions and for great prices! And when I got the check I couldn't understand how I was only paying $30 for two people, and I had dessert! This place is just too great!"}
{"text":"Went there on Jan 9 and had an excellent hamburger with fries. Returned with a friend on Jan 11 for breakfast. Staff was friendly, servers were attentive, but food left something to be desired. Friend ordered her one piece of bacon \"snap apart crisp\". It came limp and barely cooked. Server graciously apologized and returned later with four pieces of bacon. Unfortunately, those four pieces were undercooked as well. I had asked that my scramble be well-done with the eggs dry. It was wet. I choked down about half of it.  The pancakes were good.  The food might be good if the cooks would listen to the servers. Unfortunately, it will be awhile before I want to go back."}
{"text":"I come here every year when I come visit my parents. Love this place. The food is great, the staff is friendly, and the prices are fair. The restaurant is so uniquely decorated; old newspapers as menus, bear claw napkins, and tons of trinkets at the register. I would have given 5 stars, but sometimes their kitchen wait times quite ridiculous. I would understand if they were packed, but the last few times we visited, 50 minutes to an hour wait for our food. We still come because we enjoy the environment, but just be aware or the wait time."}
{"text":"Great restaurant...Mindy was our server this evening. She is a friendly person. She did a great job letting us know about the specials, the soup of the day,  and a little bit about the history of the restaurant.  I had the Turkey Club sandwich, which had more than just turkey and bacon on it. it included ham as well. It was the best tasting sandwich I have ever had,  as was the cup of chicken noodle soup and the muffin!  At the end of our meal, Mindy was also helpful in directing us to the nearest Wal-Mart,  and she was very kind to listen to the stories of a couple of people in the group.   I would definitely return to this location and request Mindy as my server."}
{"text":"This is a great place to sit around and catch up with friends and they have a great variety of breakfast, lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, thought I try it out, since it was recommended  by a friend. It's your typical diner, I had the burger and wife had the chicken and waffles. Food was good but be warn there is a bit of a long wait for service. I checked the reviews before and some yelpers have mentioned the bad wait for service. Guess it's a hit and miss."}
{"text":"First timer, love this place. The food was great, the service was great, the atmosphere was great. It was perfect!"}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner is a quaint and cozy eating spot. W stopped in for Dinner this evening and it was great! I got the open faced turkey sandwich and it was fabulous! They use real turkey so it's not fake processed crap. The pancakes are to die for!! Probably the best I've ever had! They use sweet cream and buttermilk with makes them not heavy at all. They are super yummy! My husband got the Grizzly platter and it was ginormous.... With eggs, hash browns, sausage, bacon, toast, ham, and pancakes. A ton of food! Definitely give this place a try if you are in the area! The service was spot on as well..which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"Yummy! The wait was definitely worth it. The service was great, all the servers and hosts were attentive. Our food was delicious and they make fresh orange juice! I definitely will be back. Oh yeah! The portions are bearnormous!"}
{"text":"BlackBear is a good place to eat breakfast items. Rest of the menu. Nothing special regular food rest of time but breakfast is good. Not cheap, average to higher price.No alcohol served. Open through out holidays like Christmas y New Years it will be open y packed because it is only place open on actual holidays for those wanting to eat out! Will
be packed! Tip well or you will disappoint hard working people,who gave up their family holiday to make $ waiting on you! Merry Christmas y Happy New Years!"}
{"text":"This is our 2nd time dining at this diner each experience has been very pleasant our server Tahra was exceptional, great personality and very knowledgeable of their products. 
Summer the food expediter was pleasant at check out.
I recommended this diner very highly..."}
{"text":"Well.....thought we'd roll the dice and try this place after my family and friends had a horrible experience here.  Why?  I have no idea.  Here go's!  First off.....Oh My God....The LOUD MUSIC!!!!!!  I felt like I was in a bar!!!!!  It was obnoxious!!!!!  Why they play such loud music on a Saturday afternoon is beyond me!  Manager must be a complete fool or just deaf!  Well.....we both ordered the Hand Carved Turkey Dinner.  Not sure where this so called turkey came from.....but I can tell you it was NOT HAND CARVED!  They give you two pieces of turkey on each plate....that were exactly the same size shape and thickness.....then they cook them on a griddle like you would a hamburger!!!!  I have never in my life seen turkey fried on a griddle and have it called hand carved!!!!  It actually had burn marks from the damn griddle!  What the hell is that?  They DO NOT cook \"REAL\" turkey at this Black Bear Diner!  Clearly they buy some pre-packed stamped out turkey product and call it hand carved.  It had absolutely no flavor whatsoever!  If I closed my eyes and ate it....I wouldn't be able to tell you what it was!  No joke!  The gravy was some canned salty gravy.  They definitely don't make that either!  The mashed potatos were ehh.  One plate had a huge mound on it....while the other plate had half as much.  No consistancy at all.  One was drowned in gravy....while the other had very little.  They veggies were nothing to write home about....just very bland and not much flavor. And our server....I believe he name was Brittany...she was no help either.  She acted like she was too busy to even take our order.  We tried to ask her questions about things on the menu before we ordered and all we got was one word answers as she looked around the dining room like she had somewhere else to be.  The place wasn't that busy at all....around 3pm in the afternoon....kind of an off time to have dinner.  Over all the food was NOT WORTH $32!!!!!  It didn't even come with soup or salad!  And that turkey product was horrid.  And the preparation was even worse!  So....we will never be back again.  Should have listened to everyone else that had a horrible experience here.  Shame on me.  And shame on Black Bear Diner for misrepresenting items on their menu!  This place doesn't hold a candle to the Black Bear Diner in Sparks and Reno NV.  If corporate owners ate here....they'd shut em down!  Because this location in Green Valley does not represent the REAL BLACK BEAR DINER'S!  This place reminds me of a knock-off diner!  If I go to a Mercedes dealership....don't try and sell me a Ford and say it's just like a Mercedes!  This diner is more like a fast food restaurant.  Save your money people.....go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"This is the new location, i give it a 3.5 stars, price is a couple more than the other locations, maybe because its located on Las Vegas Blvd, in a outlet shopping center. Food is pretty much the same as the other locations, but i felt they were lacking the service. It wasn't as busy that evening we went for dinner. It took awhile before the waiter came by to take our orders, and we would have to ask for to refill water every now and then. We had order the special on the menu that evening, the fish fry and its unlimited but we had to ask for it, when at other locations they would ask if we would like any more. Over all it was an okay visit, but i would have expected a little more after visiting the other locations many times. Hopefully the next time i return it will get a better!"}
{"text":"I think I once wrote a review for this place and removed it.  At any rate, the Black Bear Diner (BBD) on Las Vegas's west side needs to be reviewed.  I once put up photos for it.

I recall discovering it around 2005 and I'm not even sure there were other BBD stores in the valley at that time.  However, it appears that there are now a foursome or thereabouts.  Regardless, this is my \"go to\" Black Bear Diner when in Sin City.

This is solid eating, folks.  I'm more of a lunch and dinner person, but I have been here for breakfast.  Breakfast may be good, but the lunch and dinner fare is great.  I like the selection of entrees, the portion size, and the taste of their food.  It's far from fine dining, but it certainly fills the stomach and is a good value.

Also, if you think The Strip is the real Vegas, you're kidding yourself.  I'm joking.  However,  If you want to rub elbows with the real Vegas, come here, especially on weekend mornings for breakfast when there's a wait.  You'll see newer cookie cutter home dwellers, mobile park residents, locals, foreigners, New Yorkers, Californians, tourists, retirees, casino employees, and employees of anything and anywhere nearby.  It almost makes the crowds on The Strip look like the fake Vegas.  Well, that's not true.  However, the reality is that this is the amalgamation of what makes Las Vegas tick, breaking bread right alongside you.

In concert with that, the service is informal, friendly, and even animated.  The same could be said of their patrons.

Of about a handful of visits over the years, two really stand out.  On a breakfast visit, the duo behind us was very interesting, but I was the one positioned to see them.  There was a sinewy muscular guy who looked like a gangster wearing a polka dot sundress with white tennis shoes and nylons and his hair in a ponytail sitting with this big guy with a beer gut in tattered jeans and work boots.  Now, while it does not matter, the hows and whys this incongrous duo are lunching together might still have you scratching your head.  And you just tell yourself that you're not in, say, Cape Girardeau, Missouri.  But it wasn't just that table.  Everyone in there was interesting in that \"everything and the kitchen sink\" Las Vegas way ... and the place was packed.

On a more recent dinner visit, a friend and I were discussing the whereabouts of a previous long term employee we were very fond of, in addition to talking about friends going back to about age 24.  A friendly enough patron approached us as he finished his dinner and started talking to us about the employee, who he also liked.  While that was good to know, that also meant that he had probably listened to half an hour worth of armchair psychology.  After chatting with us, he left.  We then paid the bill and also left.  Once we got into the car, we busted up laughing because we were wondering how much of our conversation he had eavesdropped on.  And you just tell yourself that you're not in, say, Seattle or Minneapolis.

In addition to their good food, amicable service, and the trademark quirky theme and decor, this is the sort of stuff that makes this BBD even more memorable.  The people are \"real\" in that irreverent, free wheeling \"doesn't matter where you're from\" Las Vegas sort of way, making this more of a \"real\" Las Vegas experience.

Black Bear Diner really covers the bases ... from Mt. Shasta, where the chain was born on a hillside where black bears eyed the strawberries, to the I-5 corridor between Portland and Seattle to the Central Valley of California to this one, at Trop and Decatur in Las Vegas.  And, regardless of which BBD I've eaten at, one can count on their consistency and on delivering."}
{"text":"I love this place! I just wish it was not so far from the house.  I am in Centennial Hills and this is a long way to go out of my way for a great meal and besides I might fall in to a food coma on the way home.  

The place is decorated with thousands of stuffed bears and other bear essentials of home decor.  The place has a very homey fell and the staff are very friendly and welcoming every time we come.  

All of the dishes have a made by Grandma Kitchens taste.  Every dish I have tried has been delicious.  The Pot Roast is so tender and amazing with the taters, veggies, and yummy gravy.  Breakfast dishes are also very delicious. I absolutely love Omelettes and they have some tasty combos. Pancakes are also solid with thick and crispy bacon.  Oh man I think I am waking up from my food coma and ready to go for another round at Black Bear Diner.  This is a must try place in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Good place to eat everything was perfect. I would recommend this to my friend's.
Steak very juicy"}
{"text":"Very welcoming, cute atmosphere, bears everywhere. First visit great service! Lots to choose from, good quality food, reasonable prices...Fun pies, well known for their desserts. Delicious pancakes, breakfast served all day. Diner style, reasonable prices and lots to choose from. Love the location."}
{"text":"Monday morning breakfast with family visiting from out-of-town. Service was friendly and food was good. I have only had breakfast there. The waffles are very good as are the biscuits.  The eggs and hash browns are standard. My husband loved the chicken and apple sausage."}
{"text":"It is a tupical diner experience (in a good way). The staff was very courteous and friendly but not over bearing. Food was good and the portions were huge so if you are watching the waist line then it is enough for two meals. They have a healthy menu section as well. The prices are good considering the amount of food you get. The food was as good as you can expect at a diner (again in a good way) and had a more home.cooked flair to it. Definitely a step above Denny's or IHOP but nothing that will blow your mind. On weekends the wait time can be 20-30 minutes but I would definitely recommend this place for a family brunch/breakfast/lunch."}
{"text":"We don't come here often as there is usually a long wait on weekends. Tried on a Friday and still a wait.  We wee seated at a table shoved into a corner because the rooms was set up on the diagonal. And I mean shoved. I couldn't get to the corner until they moved the table. Coffee was old, bitter and burnt. Ordered breakfast and my potatoes were cold. Toast wasn't buttered, and husband's was burnt. Cold potatoes. No salt and pepper on table and an empty ketchup bottle. Lock on the ladies room stall is installed so the bolt is nowhere near the hole and you need to try and hold the door shut for a little privacy. Total disappointment, except eggs were cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast I must say, me and my girlfriend went on a Saturday morning could get a little busy of course waiting just 15 mins to get seated not bad. I got the country fried steak it was amazing huge portion sizes for sure you'll be coming out with boxes full of leftovers. Definitely recommend this place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Service was horrible!!!!!!!! Our waitress Christy took our order and never came back until we went to complain then every ran for assistance. I said soft bacon and it was burnt!!! I will never go here again will stick to the normal blueberry hill for breakfast"}
{"text":"well what has normally been a good spot had some tough times this morning my eggs bene the eggs were as hard as rock after telling the very nice and mostly effeciante server i asked if she could get me 2 more poached eggs......she did unfortunately it took 7/8 minutes and by that time it was a little late .....UNFORTUNATELY these eggs were a little over done as well ...not like the first ones they were very apologetic and only charged me 1/2 price for my breakfast............should have been free in my opinion ..BUT i will say i have had probley 8 breakfasts there in the last year and all were good ....i usually go in monday mornings"}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast joint. 
They have the BEST pancakes in the valley.


We've only been in for breakfast since their dinner menu doesn't offer any vegetarian options besides getting a grilled cheese or asking for no meat on the salads. Adding a veggie burger would be inexpensive for the restaurant, can be tossed in the back of the freezer and be charged the same price as a beef burger. 

This simple addition would allow us to come in for dinner all the time!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome.  The service was great and everyone was incredibly polite.  The ambiance is on point for their theme.  The food was great.  I ordered the cinnamon roll French toast and have zero complaints.  It was so delicious.  Everyone else at the table liked what they ordered also.  I most certainly will go back."}
{"text":"The ambiance says it. A cabin country feeling that is both clean and welcoming. Servers are always very friendly on Saturday mornings (when I visit the diner). The food portions our outrageous in size, especially the homemade biscuits.  The kids will love this place and couples will feel like they took a mini-trip.

Can accommodate low carb
Had small portion options
Has vegetarian options
Not sure about gluten free options"}
{"text":"Took my mom and her friend there as I really like this place. There is tons to choose from and the service is top notch. Our server was amazing and took our picture together. Mom wants to go back and try more on the menu. I'll probably bring the whole family next time."}
{"text":"Stop by after church on the way home. Truthfully never noticed this place. It doesn't look inviting from the outside (don't judge a book by it's cover). The wait was really long, yes it was lunch time. I wanted breakfast and if you follow me you know I love my french toast. Yup they we're yummy! Our waitress Alexia was amazing, sweet, helpful, and patient. Why patient? I ordered, cancelled, and ordered again. Why? Had a emergency call had to leave, emergency was resolved within 10 min. Thanks Alexis for understanding. Food good, service good, decor could use a little update. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Well I must say, I never new mushrooms came in chicken pot pie!  Oh no they didn't.  Had to send back the meal and get something else. Salad was awesome and so was the tuna melt i had to reorder.  Manager was very nice as we spoke with him about the meal. Unfortunately the supervisor we spoke to was not very knowledgeable about the way to cook salmon, as my son in law got, if the salmon was not thick.  Seriously!  It was like a brick, crispy on outside and dry in the middle.  

As for their service, our waitress was just ok.  Turned nice when I pointed out there was no mention of mushrooms in the pot pie on the menu.  She immediately responded, yes, just spoke to my manager about that.  Well, I was right!

Well must say I will not return if I return to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I had never been here before. Love the decor and the menu! It life like a newspaper and even had fun facts from the 1950's. The portions are good size. The staff was friendly but not uncomfortably friendly. The food was good also I had the chicken fried steak and couldn't finish it. The only thing I wish was the prices were a little cheaper."}
{"text":"I love this place great service and awesome pot roast....hard to find a good one...large portions for the money"}
{"text":"Really enjoy coming here! The food is not too bad! Portions are huge! There was a slight wait this time around but they were quick in getting us seated and we ordered right away and the time the food was ready for us, came in a decent time! That's always a plus when you're hungry!"}
{"text":"First time here and I had the huevos rancheros and my hubby had the chicken and waffles. I probably should have stuck to something more traditional for a place named Black Bear Diner. It was tasty, but the potatoes it was served with were cold. The salsa was hot, meaning steaming. Eggs were supposed to be over medium, but only one was, sort of. My hubby loved the chicken and waffles! Service is a bit slow, and a second cup of coffee did not come until the end of the meal. What makes me willing to come back is the attitude of our server, David. I was very impressed by how upbeat and positive he was. Because  of him I will be back and try again. I will say that the place was nice and open and airy."}
{"text":"Being sat down and receiving drinks is quick but ordering took so long, second time I visit this location and both time have been disappointing. Food took so long to come out and when it did my sandwich was burned I did not want to have the hassle of waiting again so I just ate everything that wasn't crispy burnt. Won't be returning to this location"}
{"text":"In my opinion, when in Vegas, there are two places to get an awesome breakfast. In strong first position is Baby Stacks= however, if you are in the area and there is a Black Bear Diner close by- by all means stop. I always select an omelet from the healthy side, you will not be disappointed. Made with egg whites, crisp fresh filling of bell pepper, onion, tomato. spinach, what ever you desire. Fresh warm toast, pancakes, awesome crispy hot potatoes, ( I always have the home fries), delicious coffee, and they even include a lil fruit bowl. Yummy, fresh and friendly, my kind of place! Have never had anything but breakfast here so I cannot comment on other menu items, but have heard the pot roast is mouthwatering. Note: There will most often be a wait because this is one hot spot to eat- I try to keep in mind that the wait isn't the fault of the management- it is the folks who are enjoying those great dishes= soon my table will come, and I will side into my seat, place my order and slowly devour every succulent morsel.... yes you will wait, but it is worth it... so very worth it."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp of course. The BF and I wanted to find a new breakfast spot. The gentlemen at the door was just warm and welcoming! The lady that dropped off our water an coffee,  plopped them down on what  we were reading with no greeting and left in a rush. Loved all the decor of the stuff bears and everything bear.

The corn beef hash was awesome. Nothing from the can, homemade! You can taste the REAL corn beef. My BF loved it. The chicken fried steak was just huge! The sweet cream pancakes were nice and fluffy. So much food for a reasonable price. We will be back."}
{"text":"We love Black Bear Diner.  The food is good, fresh, and large portions.  The wait staff is always helpful and friendly.  
Now to why only 3 stars: I had tried to make reservations several weeks ago for 20 people this morning (Wednesday).  I was told that they don't take reservations (they did when this same group when another time) and just have someone come in earlier than when we wanted to be seated to put our name on the list.  I got there this morning a half hour before the group would arrive.  The same nasty hostess that seems to be always there was even nastier than usual.  female/20s/bleached blonde curly hair/5'6\"   I have been there when she has been draped across the hostess counter.  Another time she was draped across the counter on her phone.  She is the only one who never has a nametag.  Anyway, she gave me such a hard time.  We never got seated for an hour!  There was a steady flow of people, but we should not have had that wait.  Instead of seating people at the EMPTY booths and getting the tables ready for us, she was seating people at tables!
Everyone enjoyed the meals.  Our server, Summer, was excellent, especially being the only waitress for us and the rest of the back room.  
Clearly, some people need a full fledged attitude adjustment.
BTW:  Four people from our group left before we were seated because of the attitude of the hostess.  They were very disgusted."}
{"text":"You can not go wrong here. It's a local favorite and always packed but for good reason. Great food, just about anything you want it, anyway you want it. It's all served with a smile and as fast as humanly possible. I always have the biscuits and gravy along with what I am getting because the biscuits are so big and soft, like pillows from heaven! Fresh squeezed OJ too! Get some!"}
{"text":"Yeah, definitely a fan! We decided to try Black Bear Diner about 6-7 weeks ago and we've been going back at least once a week. Not only is the service great, but the menu is expansive and the portions are Claim Jumper huge! We absolutely love the friend chicken meal and their bacon is excellent. They also offer burgers, sandwiches and salads so there is something for everyone. The best however is the bowl of pie. YUM We tried chocolate and banana cream the other day and it was dangerously addicting. When you go, check out the orange juice machine in the kitchen and order some. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We went to Black Bear for the first time a week ago. I have had it before for dessert but not dinner.

The portions were very large but the customer service was lacking. They were very slow to take our order and we had to get the manager to help us often.

I gave the three stars for the managers hard work to make things right and the family friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food here is fairly standard diner fare, with a pared down menu. I don't mind that as I'm always overwhelmed at places with large menus. 

The food is good, though probably not great. However, the service is typically impeccable. This morning I went in for my free birthday breakfast (sign up on the mailing list!). There was a mix up on my order so they boxed up the mistake and made me a new plate with the other as a to-go. After we ate more than we should have, our sweet server offered me birthday ice cream. While my brain said \"it's 9:30 in the morning\" my heart and mouth said \"Huckleberry, please!\"

We always have a great time. And will surely be back."}
{"text":"Friday night fish fry is the BOMB! Their pies and omelettes are tasty too! Staff is always friendly. It's just kinda dirty for a restaurant though especially since they recently \"remodeled\" and I don't see anything too different."}
{"text":"Being new to the western states, I was unfamiliar with this restaurant and had not read any Yelp reviews before I ate breakfast here yesterday. What a pleasant surprise! Breakfast was awesome. The menu items are unique and the taste superb. The waffle I had was very light and tasty. I always order bacon extra crispy, and that's the way it came. 

My wife and I will definitely take out of towners here when they visit. We need more high quality restaurants like this south of I-10 in Goodyear."}
{"text":"This is your average run of the mill diner.  Chicken fried steak was not fresh rather frozen, pre battered and fried.  The corn on the cob was awful and the staff was less than desirable.  The manager on duty, a tall older gentleman was more interested in flirting with the women staff.  Saw him reach his bare hands in chocolate chips or something to scoop out for a shake after clearing tables and hands in his hair."}
{"text":"Awww.......disappointed.
Me and kids........3 meals, 3 let downs.
 Figured it was going to be awesome. Place was packed.

I ordered the tuna melt and asking if it was a good sized sandwich.  The waitress assured me that it was a GOOD SIZE, then she recommended the chips over the fries.
I got fries and I had to peel apart the bread to make sure there was tuna inside.

I ended up with a TUNA WISH sandwich.........I WISH THERE WAS MORE THAN A SPOONFUL OF TUNA IN MY SANDWICH.

Wont be back."}
{"text":"Great food nice environment,  little pricey but the portions are large. Amazing breakfast."}
{"text":"Just ate here today. Food was really good. Service was ok. Sat close to the kitchen so I had a front row seat to the chaotic activities of the waitresses. 

They were very loud and obnoxious and sometimes rude to each other but never did the customers see that they were boarder line out of control. 

I will eat there again I just want to sit far away from the kitchen."}
{"text":"I would recommend breakfast but be ready to eat - I would almost say it is a better brunch-time breakfast because I literally skipped lunch.  I had the corned beef hash which I thought was a little greasy but otherwise very tasty.  The hashbrowns were very good and they got the eggs right :) bonus points for a waitress who was willing to accommodate my kids."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!!! Great service!  Thanks April!! Food arrived fast (thank you to the kitchen).  Servings were large so I could not eat it all... Homemade biscuits that are so fluffy and delicious... If you want fresh squeezed orange juice... They make it here! If you want to get off the strip for an affordable great breakfast with the locals... EAT HERE !!"}
{"text":"I think I ordered the wrong thing considering there are lots of great reviews for Black Bear Diner.  I met a business contact here for breakfast  and the place was big and services was wonderful.  I ordered the following:

Corned Beef and Hash ($10): it came with a side of \"fresh watermelon\", two over easy eggs and a biscuit.  The Corned Beef was not from a can but it overcooked where the meat was crunchy and hard.  The fresh watermelon was not fresh, it looked like it was sitting in a serving container.  The biscuit was OK and the over easy eggs were good. 

Polish Sausage Link ($4.50): The polish sausage had no flavor and it was super greasy.

There are other better breakfast places in Las Vegas so I will go there first before I go back to Black Bear Diner."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my boyfriend.. and he had his name on a list for a seat only to get skipped. Thank you to the hostess, Brenda for screwing up my first experience at this restaurant. My boyfriend and I were told it would take about 10 mins. She had us down for Michael party of 2. We waited for 20 & she had already seated a group of people who came after we did.. Same name but party of 4. We look down on the list and it showed that my boyfriend's name was crossed out.. As if we were already seated. But no. We were not. 

Yes, I understand it was busy. But when more than one group who have been waiting longer than others are not getting seated when they are supposed to be, you guys have a problem. We & another family who got skipped ended up walking out because of the inconvenience. Terrible. I hope when we decide to come try this place again someone who knows what they're doing is the host."}
{"text":"Checked out this place last weekend so I needed to get my review in. My best friend and her fiance brought us here... we didn't have a choice! Lol. But I was pleasantly suprised- though I really had no preconceived notions either way. The interior looked like it could use an update and there was a 35 minute wait on a Saturday around 10am ish. The staff was very friendly and our waitress in the suspenders (I think they all have to wear them- cutting edge fashion) and hipster glasses (a girl's gotta accessorize!) was very friendly, helpful, and she kept our drinks filled. The food portions were hefty- which is good if you are starving or you could save half for later. My husband and I shared The Grizz and it was huge- eggs how you like them, two sausages, two bacons, a slab of ham, skillet potatoes or hash browns, and two fluffy pancakes. Even sharing we had to take some home. The food was pretty good but kinda greasy spoon to me. The pancakes were the fluffiest I have ever had and tasted like angel food cake to me. My best friend got the 'smaller portion' biscuits and gravy and it was pretty big still so she could share it around- and she liked it. I can't remember what her fiance got.., sorry. After you finish your meal you bring your check up to the front to pay where I almost had to impulse buy a cuddly stuffed black bear. But I made it out without buying a wooden magnet, beer, or pie. Overall, a solid performance and seemingly decent value and pretty good- just not something I would go out of my way to get back to. But- if I got brought back here again- I wouldn't complain and I would get that stuffed grizzly on the way out. ;)"}
{"text":"Ate the cinnamon roll French toast which was delicious but if you want breakfast, breakfast then I'd suggest something else...had a fruit cup along with it which only had strawberries, grapefruit, and pineapples.  I love OJ and this was super delicious, tasted very fresh!"}
{"text":"So half way through a pretty good breakfast, one of six of us found a hair on our food. The waitress said she would remove it from the bill. As the check arrived, we noticed the manager took off 10%. I asked to speak to him and basically got into an argument over him removing a nine dollar breakfast item. We were all pretty mortified to be treated so poorly. They definitely lost 6 customers. Fail"}
{"text":"Oh this place, wow. I suppose it will do the job in a pinch but quite honestly it seemed to be like a 50 year old Denny's. The furniture and surroundings seem to be very dated. The décor is supposed to be the inside of a cabin in the woods. I just got an odd vibe from this place. The food was just okay, I had scrambled eggs with cheese, onion, spinach. It was good although I ate about half of it. Everything was just plain and nothing special. I would go here if I had to but I would not go out of my way to eat here, sorry."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Can't wait to visit again. I hope they open a location in San Tan Valley!"}
{"text":"Chose this restaurant since it was walking distance to our hotel. 
Walked right in, it was busy but we were seated fast. 
We had chicken Cesar salad, kids burger, kids mac, chicken fried steak, and tri tip. 
The corn bread they gave us, so good! The Tri was good, but wasn't as rare as I like but the mashed potatoes and gravy, so good! The chicken fried steak was amazing!! 
The service is good and our waitress was very friendly. If I was ever in the area again I'd go back."}
{"text":"After a very long day and getting to our home away from home it was very late for us,11:30pm our time and still needed to eat dinner. We stopped at the diner. We were greeted as soon as we went in, seated and had beverages almost as soon as we sat down. Our waiter was awesome! I'm sorry I can't recall his name, but he yells out corner whenever he enters or exits the kitchen! He welcomed us and gave a couple of suggestions--- I had the roast beef special which was so flavorful and tender and my husband a burger and fried. Our waiter suggested a milkshake, which of corse my husband got. Cookies and cream --//a beverage and dessert all together. What a great experience!!!! Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Just found out about this place. Wow, where have I been. I split one of those huge bacon cheeseburgers with my grandson. FANTASTIC! I was More than full of a great tasting burger on Only half an order. Went back the next day for a linguicia breakfast plate. I was in heaven. Haven't had decent linguicia since leaving the east coast unless someone sent it to me."}
{"text":"Omelette was great! Avocados we're not the freshest but I ate them anyways. Watched a waitress pick up a lemon with her hand and put it in someone's water. Gross!!!"}
{"text":"We recently moved from Avondale to Glendale. We have always loved our Goodyear location so of course we assumed we would love this location. 

It is nicer and has newer decor from the Goodyear location.

We were a table of 6 and they tried to put us in a booth. We saw a table for 6 and requested to sit there. Seemed to annoy two of the waitress's and one even made a comment about it. 

The food was exactly as we expected and was on point as far as flavor. However, the service is terrible. The servers are rude. For someone who makes their money from tips none of them appeared to be happy about working or going above and beyond to be accommodating. Says on the receipt that our server was Brian but it was a young female. 

We spent over $150.00 in your restaurant last night and am not sure if we would be returning. Which saddens me since we frequent went to our Goodyear location weekly."}
{"text":"Every single time is always pleasant and the food is amazing. My server Mindy is amazing! She's always pleasant, nice. She's awesome! Love love coming here."}
{"text":"Stopped here while on a shopping trip at the outlets. I was craving simple food and a big salad after a week of expensive rich hotel food. Service was great, lots of staff working and attending to my table of one. Only complaint is when I asked, I was told the salad had \"no onions\" but then the tuna salad actually had onions chopped and mixed in. I'm highly allergic so I had to pick them all out. Still tasted great."}
{"text":"My first visit. Had the bacon pancakes. Could only eat half as there was so much. Very good country style pancakes. Next time I'll try the country fried steak.
Barbara, the waitress was very friendly and quick.
No complaints."}
{"text":"We were running a little low in funds and has a few folks to feed. My niece recommend this place. We tried a variety of meals, sandwich,soups, burgers and everyone loved their meals. Great prices 4 adult 2 kids for $50 bucks. Will visit again."}
{"text":"Been here for breakfast twice now. Both times food was good, decent portions. Service was good as well. Decor is very beary. You'd never guess this place used to be a Chili's. But they serve Pepsi products, hence the 3 stars."}
{"text":"I'm a regular there and it is always amazing !  Had a really amazing experience the other day dining in w my best friend who was visiting Vegas.  The manager Don was a pleasure and the food was spot on.  My friend is a very picky eater and she loved everything.  The portions are huge the staff is friendly! 6 stars!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best BBD and service ever out of all the branches!!  April was our service with help from Angela and they were friendly, efficient and went above and beyond to make sure our experience was amazing!! I can appreciate amazing customer service anywhere as its rarely seen nowadays.  My Husband loved his fresh corn beef & hash and I loved my california eggs benedict minus the bacon added mushrooms yummy!!!!  We also had their fresh squeezed orange juice so sweet and yummy, sweet cream pancake and fruit all bomb!! Diner food all fresh all perfect!!!! Thank you BBD and April we shall be back next time we visit Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant. All employees are friendly. Every time I've gone for breakfast I am Satisfied. Yummy food"}
{"text":"Can you say one of the worst meals ever. Had so called Meatloaf.took 3 bites. Was sick to my stomach 20 minutes after eating at this HOLE. Spent 2 days of your trip dealing with the Bear Poison. STAY AWAY"}
{"text":"Based on Yelp reviews, we tried this diner for breakfast.  At first taste, it seems this is indeed as good as it gets for diner food.  I had the California Bacon Benedict.  Every layer of the dish was snapping with flavor and freshness.  It came with sides of hash browns and fresh fruit, and they were both excellent too.  The only part of the meal that wasn't top notch was the coffee, which tasted the way you'd expect diner coffee to taste.  

The ambiance reminded me a bit of a mountain lodge that is a favorite of ours.  Representations of black bears are all around, from the wood carvings out front to the wallpaper.  The service was also top notch - quick and friendly.  In short, it was a most satisfying meal.  We will be going back for lunch soon."}
{"text":"Great foods!!! What ever what you order all delicious. Big portion. But a bit  disappointed today. Coming for pineapple pancake,  but they don't  sell anymore.
I hope they bring it back."}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant in town. I live across the street and I always drive passed it but never stopped in. I had guest in from out of town and they wanted to check this place out. Best decision I've made!! We were immediately seated and the awesome customer service began. Marlene was the best waitress I've had in a very long time. She was attentive, humble, fun and made sure our drinks stayed filled. ALL The food we had was finger licking good and huge portions. I am definitely going back here especially on the days Marlene works."}
{"text":"The first thing you notice about this place is that they are actually true to theme of the name of their restaurant. Everywhere you look, there is something that has to do with black bears. You don't see that at every place you go to eat at.

Since im trying to stay away from red meat, I ordered the Spicy Turkey on Sourdough Bread. It came with onion rings. If you refer to my pic, the sandwich itself is pretty big. I gotta say it was very tasty with a little kick to it. It Definitely filled me up.

Service was above average meaning she came around and checked up on me every now and then. I only had to ask for refills once so she was on point for the most part.

I would say this place is a decent place to go to if plan A falls through. For some reason I thought they were 24 hours but they have had the same hours since they opened long ago.

So this place to me is ok in my book. Decent food, service, and ambiance. Nothing really stands out and nothing really deserves a complaint."}
{"text":"Great place to eat your breakfast and lunch. My favorite is hot beef sandwich or hot turkey sandwich. Place is beautiful and lots bears on the roof hanging. their plates are huge and two people even cant finish. I tried the stake and not really happy with the medium rear, the waitress quickly make me a another stake right on the perfection. I  was surprise the service how quick they are. Coffee is the second best for the 7-Eleven coffee. i highly recommend for anybody to go to this place."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice. Once when the restaurant first opened, and today. I remembered it being good, so we decided to give it a more current taste test.
My grandmother ordered the biscuits and gravy with a side of sausage. The sausage links were big and the side came with 3 of them. She said that the gravy had no meaty flavour which in turn made the whole meal bland. John S. ordered the special for the day, eggs, one piece of each meat and country fried potatoes. He seemed pleased. 

Even though my two dining companions opted for brunch, I went straight for the lunch menu and got a much desired Reuben sandwich. I absolutely loved the sandwich! The rye bread was toasty, the swiss cheese was melty, the beef was corney and the sauerkraut and pickles were perfect additions. The sandwich came with a wide choice of sides, so I picked potato salad. 

When I took a bite of the potato salad it tasted funny. Not like a bad funny, just a different funny and I didn't like it. I had John try it and he liked it but said it did have a different taste. I poked around and found out to my horror it had BLACK OLIVES in it! EWWWW!

I really don't like black olives and I was horrified to find them sneakily placed in my potato salad. I have NEVER experienced black olives in potato salad of any kind. 

Black olive haters be warned!

Otherwise, I would and will eat here again. There is a lot on the menu to pick from. Service was good!"}
{"text":"Just had breakfast at Black Bear and it was terrific.  Fresh ingredients, I was able to get a terrific gluten free, egg free, dairy free salad (Mediterranean salad) and husband had the volcano! Service was friendly, prompt, and attentive. Atmosphere was clean, open, and spacious. We will definitely be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"This morning we went to Black Bear Diner. I ordered the wrong thing so I will have to go back and order something else. I ordered sweet cream pancakes, bacon, and eggs. My bacon and eggs were good but I did not care for their pancakes. The pancakes were very sweet; too sweet for me. The pancakes were too fluffy. They fell apart when I put my spoon through it. They actually melted in your mouth. On the other hand my husband ordered the Fiesta scramble with red potatoes and his food was pretty good. I give his breakfast a 3 1/2 star. Our meal came up to 33 dollars and some change. I will need to revisit this place, order something else, and review it again. Remember, this is just my opinion on my breakfast; I am sure that there are other things on the menu that taste great."}
{"text":"Food has decreased in quality and the service is just not as good as before. It took our server at least 15 minutes for drinks and still couldn't take our order. I won't be going back b"}
{"text":"Finally stopped for breakfast here after driving by for years. Nice family, diner atmosphere. The staff is very friendly and does a great job getting everyone a table as quickly as possible. I had am omelette with hash browns and it was delish! The best part was the biscuit that came with my breakfast, it was as big as my hand. I can't wait to go back for another. The dessert case is conveniently by the cashier and it all looks amazing. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Since this is a new location I already knew the wait would be long. Anything new that opens in this area is flooded for the first month. I came around 5pm for dinner and was immediately seated. I had the club and fries and it was very good. I have also had breakfast here and the wait was longer than I would like, however it was expected and the food was still amazing. Complain about wait times all you want, but the customers are the ones taking their time and playing on the phone while sitting at the tables even when they are done. It is the joy of eating out. I just expect to wait and am happy I don't have to cook. I definitely will be back many times."}
{"text":"If I'm hungry for breakfast and there's a BBD close by it's a no brainer. The fresh squeezed OJ is delicious and the omelette are too. I've made the mistake of ordering the Lumberjack which is great to split with someone but way over the top for one. They should come out with a lumber Jill version. It's 6am on a Sunday morning I'm laying in bed at Rio and as soon as I get processed I'm driving to Jones and Trop to chow down at the bear. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Terrible service and food is not consistent with other locations! I took my Mom, who happened to be visiting from out of town... decided to try the new location in Laveen, which is a few blocks away from my home. Instead of going to the one that i normally visit in Goodyear... HUGE MISTAKE! Waited forever to be seated, when they were not full... i saw open tables for small parties, ready and waiting. Once we were FINALLY seated, we waited at least 30 minutes for a server to acknowledge that our orders haf not yet been taken. And that was AFTER my Mom politely got the attention of a hostess and asked if we would be visited by our waitress soon. lol i sat there, tight lipped... ready to blow at that point. So glad that she beat me to the punch!!! 

Finally got our food... disgusting and cold!!!! WTH!! The recipes didn't even seem consistent! I will say that the waitresses was overly nice... she knew by the look on my face that I was not a happy camper. She apologized multiple times... that was the only reason I stayed and actually left her a tip.

Long story coming to a screaching halt... I will NEVER again visit the Laveen Black Bear Diner again in my life. I'll drive all the way to Goodyear, where the service and food are awesome!"}
{"text":"Soooooooo yummy!!! I love this place. I do not eat pancakes because of the carbs but I cannot resist them from this restaurant. Your pancakes are absolutely delicious! Service is always wonderful and the portions are huge. My only disappointment was we brought a berry cobbler home. The crust looked flaky but was terrible!! They definitely need to do a better job with their pies and cobblers. Other than that I
Wish there was a black bear diner in San Diego!!"}
{"text":"If this review wss based on the food it would a lot higher. The service was awful.  Our servers name was  Juvenile.  It took FOREVER to have  our drink order taken. Then to have our food order taken. My family and I were ready get up and walk out when our food finally came out.  It was decent food but not worth the hour we were there. The place wasn't even busy. The table next to us had a different server, came in after us and had their food first. The manager never came out frim behind the counter and had no clue what was going on in the rest of the place."}
{"text":"I have seen these places around town and never stopped in until a friend of the wife recommended the food so highly, we made a special trip.

Wow, what a place.  I love the \"bear in the woods\" decor.  Not over done, yet funny and playful throughout

The staff was all helpful and friendly, never overbearing or intrusive, yet fast and efficient.

Fast from order to delivery of food!  The food was excellent, I had the Bear's Choice with Biscuits and Gravy. Very good, very filling, more there then you can finish. 
 
After tasting my wife's pancakes, I should have gone with our server's recommendation and had the pancakes!  Those things have a sweet honey taste to them.  

All of it was delicious and more then we could eat.  Even checking out was fast and friendly.  

We will be back for lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"Looking for great breakfast? Here's a new go to spot. 

Sadly a chain but a good one at that...

Good service, portions and food.

We both ordered breakfast and had more leftovers than we the food we ate! And yes the food was good. The food came just ordered and there was little if anything lacking in service. Prompt and friendly...

The chicken fried steak was hot and had plenty of gravy. The corned beef hash was a huge hit! Delicious, filling and less filler than any other corned beef hash I've ever tried! The hash-browns were great! Since I normally like home-fries or the diced potatoes I was really surprised at how good they tasted. Definitely get them instead of the red potatoes.

The pancakes were WAY too heavy & had little taste. I nearly dislocated a shoulder lifting the plate. I wouldn't recommend them unless you are looking to be a human anchor.

All in all it's a great go to place for breakfast & I can't wait to try the regular menu."}
{"text":"Great service but food was sub-par and bathrooms were very dirty especially for first thing in the morning. We got tomatoes with our dish and they were not fresh, very close to being spoiled. :(
It's too bad because our server was very good."}
{"text":"BBD...Bell Biv Devoe or Black Bear Diner?? Either way, you'll want to smack it up, flip it, rub it down!!   We came in with appetites and left with food babies.  

I felt bad for our poor waitress because I literally sent her away 3 times before I was ready to order.   Impressive, extensive menu that has every savory, buttery delicious breakfast treat and combo you could ever hope for.

My girlfriend commented that the crowd was a bizarre mix of local seniors and mature families...and young yelpers.  She was right.  But what everyone had in common were forkfuls of pancake goodness and huge contented smiles.  Oh mama.....are they pancakes or cupcakes??  wow.

 I always give bonus points to Vegas establishments that don't feel like Vegas.  This place, as others have said, has a comfortable Northwestern atmosphere, that the owners have succeeded in keeping authentic (if a bit kitschy) with several hundred bears everywhere your eye wanders. Papa Bear swung by our table to check on us, which was a nice touch.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot.  I get the corn beef hash and it always come out nice.  The service is good for a cafe and the coffee is tasty."}
{"text":"Ate at black bear diner several times.  It's nice to have a place out here instead of driving to Kingdom Come to go to Denny's or IHOP.  It's refreshing not to have to drive so far.  Both times I came the waits were 15 minutes long or maybe longer which is acceptable because it's a brand new store. I'm pretty sure once the hoopla dies down you'll get regulars who come in and will get seated rather fast. The portions are huge enough for eat there and take the other half home or splitting between two people.  The staff is very courteous and kind and are very helpful"}
{"text":"This here place is one that I first tried after I moved from Arizona and now we stop everytime we travel to to catch our beloved Padres or Kevin Harvick in the NASCAR circuit. I like it because it feels like a small town diner. 

Be ready to strap your feed bag on because the portions are quite large. I swore I was going to order a small breakfast because I had been eating like a hawg all weekend but the Black Bear Diner didn't oblige. 

I had the all meat omelet with home style potatoes and a big ole biscuit. Uuggggghh.

The wife had the corned beef with the same sides. Uugggghh again. 

Then, feeling some extra space in my belly, I decided to go over the top and order a piece of pie because it was National Pi Day. (3.14....Pi, get it?)

I usually only eat here once a year but the BBD has never let me down. I don't know how it is during the rest of the year but expect long lines during Spring Training and NASCAR races. 

No matter, worth the wait."}
{"text":"Cindie was our server and she was amazing! The restaurant was relatively busy and had what appeared to be a small staff working at the time but that didn't impact us at all.. Cindie was very sweet, energetic, and helpful. Service was quick. Food was delicious."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place, given that it received raving reviews.

I ordered the chicken fried steak with hash browns/eggs.  The CFS was crispy on the edges (well... it's fried).  The hash browns/eggs were lukewarm for some reason.  

It's not terrible food... but I think that one can do better in LV."}
{"text":"Dirty place settings and no knives. Ordered chilaquilas and asked for extra green sauce on the side. Yeah never got it. They have flavored creamer but you have to ask for it, they don't offer it when they take your drink order. Hubby ordered sausage patty and potatoes with biscuit and eggs over medium. Stick with hash browns as potatoes are not cooked. Thought we would take home some bread pudding but they had no sauce made, wanted to give us Carmel sauce. It was 11:30 am and they still hadn't made any sauce. Probably won't be back to this location. One on Flamingo is better all around."}
{"text":"After running a 5 K it's always a good idea to fill up on some heavy carbs, fat, and protein. It's the best excuse I have to pig out and feel only a fraction of the guilt. Black Bear was a great experience for us hungry runners. We brought out appetites and they satisfied us with no room to spare. The platters of food came out quick and heaping. The Original bear claw pastry is great to share, just make sure to eat it before it cools, which will be no problem at all. The coffee is actually drinkable without adding heaps of sugar and cream, not what you'd expect from a franchise, traditional diner. The mugs were so cute I wanted to take one home which I'm sure I could have since they sold an assortment of Black Bear memorabilia also. For five people the bill was just over $50 which is a value! I had the homemade Italian spice sausage patties that were made crisp and savory, while the rest of the group had granola pancakes, the \"Volcano\" of pancakes and eggs, and fruit platter. Everyone was satisfied, full, and ready to hibernate the day away."}
{"text":"One of my favorite country style comfort food restaurants hands down! They have an assortment of foods anything from your normal eggs,sausage,pancake breakfast platter, to one of their best sellers their homemade meatloaf. If you are in the mood for food to lift your spirits but not worried about calorie counting this is the restaurant for you! Great portions, good quality, and very very affordable! What more could you want?!
       I got The Bizz; 3 eggs, 2 sweet cream pancakes, 2 sausage, 2 pieces of bacon and hash-browns. It was exactly how I imagined and the pancakes were some of the best I ever had. I have never been big on pancakes but I fell in love with these they were fluffy and being made with sweet cream gave them this hint of sweetness. The only thing that could have been better were the hash-browns. They weren't your normally shredded  potatoes they were more like flat noodles that had been cut up and fried. The outside of the hash-browns were very crispy and the inside really soggy....were not really seasoned so they left much to the imagination. I think I will choose the country potatoes instead next time.
       My boyfriend got the country fried steak. Never been a fan of country fried anything because it is normally very very salty. This on the other hand was pretty good. My boyfriend being a country boy raised on this stuff said it was very very good. 
       Last but not least no matter how full you are you must take home or try one of their home baked goods. I have always gotten their cobblers and they have never failed me. Crust and fruit filling are always the perfect combination and the crust especially flaky and buttery. This time around I tried the strawberry cream pie with cookie crust yum yum. I think I would like their banana cream or even coconut cream pie better. But def must try! I will continue to come here time and time again. The only thing missing that would make this restaurant that much better would be grits! Please get some grits in!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, service, & the get the food out fresh, immediately when it's made.  So your food is served immediately & tastes great! Fantastic cooks & management. Upbeat, & the employees are happy & respect each other."}
{"text":"I really hate to give this place only 3 stars because the servers are always so nice....however it is a restaurant and the quality of the food is so important. I have had breakfast and dinner meals here. The breakfast is easily a 4 star experience. The pancakes are perfectly prepared, light and fluffy. The biscuits and gravy are over the top. 

The dinner on the other hand is profound 1 star. The fried chicken was over prepared, under seasoned, and honestly tasted horrible. If I'm doing dinner I usually try the vegetable and mashed starch ( potatoes) option. For some reason I went with the fries and they were not good at all. The green beans with bacon saved this dish from being sent back. Even though the waitress asked me how everything was I just couldn't bring myself to tell her. She was so nice and I knew that the words I had in my mind to express my dislike for the meal would not have been pleasant at all. I left a larger then usual tip because I could only imagine how bad she must feel delivering such a poor product to people all day long. 

AGAIN BREAKFAST AMAZEBALLS....DINNER TERRIBLE!"}
{"text":"The service was quick and friendly. The food was great, with large servings and quality ingredients. Half of our party ordered lunch and half ordered breakfast and everyone was really happy with their food. I would definitely come back here again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Nice place with awesome food and service. My cheeseburger was wonderful and my wife's tri tip sandwich was awesome. The price is right also"}
{"text":"I have driven by this restaurant many times and thought it looked cute with the bear theme, so I saw they were having a Friday nite fish fry, that sounded good. So I asked two other people to come with me, none of us had been here before. The waitress was quick to wait on us with drinks, no complaint there. She took our order for the fish fry. We couldn't believe what we got, burned fish. How they could even send that out is beyond me. It came with French fries that must have been cooked and sitting for a while, not good and the cole slaw was warm. The tartar sauce was yellow. We told the waitress we didn't want this burned fish, all three of us had burned fish. She brought back 2 pieces of fish for each of us. It was lighter in color but had no taste, I couldn't tell what the coating was. I called the manager over and pointed at the burned fish we received, he said sorry, I told him the Cole slaw is warm, he said it must have been sitting under a heat lamp. Why? We gave up trying to eat anything, got the bill, the manager took one of the fish fry's off. We left feeling hungry and sorry for the money we wasted."}
{"text":"Love this place so glad the remodel is completed, the place looks amazing!!! Marlene waited on us and Don the manager they are so amazing they make you feel like family then there's the delicious food and huge portions can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"We had stopped going to Black Bear restaurant because the fish fry was over done very dark coating on fish I would say old oil decided to try them again today 11/03/2017 n guess what same thing over deep fried fish with one golden colored fish this was a carry out two pieces were so over deep fried they was fish inside of the coating check out my photos"}
{"text":"Well as always this place so impressed me with the amazing service and food. The portion on each plate is not to be taken lightly. Make sure you wear your stretch pants . Wow I tried so hard to knock out the grizz breakfast but it snuck up on me and BAM it was a tko for the grizz. next time mr. bear next time. Abel was fast to top off my drink and checked on me just enough.  walk in and wobble out."}
{"text":"A couple notches above typical diner fare. Five us went in for dinner two had breakfast. All entrees were hotAnd fresh. Hostess seated us immediately and brought our beverages. Mindy was our server. She did an excellent hi and very friendly. Well back for sure."}
{"text":"I showed up with the wife after a night of country music festival fun. Needless to say I was hungry. When we first drove by the line was king and the place looked packed. Instead of ditching the spot and heading down to IHop I went inside to check on the wait. 30 minutes for a party of 2. That sounds problematic.... however this is where my 5 star factor kicks in early. The bar at the front entrance is OPEN SEATING. I jumped across the floor and slid into a couple of seats next to the fresh juice machine.

While I'm speaking of fresh juice... they squeeze real oranges and make REAL orange juice. It smells freaking awesome and it's cool to watch the machine spinning and doing its thing. The coffee was fresh, and they will toss you some flavored creamer if you ask nicely. 

I was super hungry and ordered the Big Bear chicken fried steak, hash browns, fresh fruit, and 2 massive biscuits. These things were no joke. The service was quick, efficient, and pleasant. Food was awesome, and definitely more then needed. It's a solid spot, especially after a night of strip adventures and such."}
{"text":"Always the best for a good home-style breakfast with fresh squeezed OJ.  As fast as the staff is moving to keep customer streaming through...service is always exceptional."}
{"text":"Fantastic. I got The Grizz. Those are the best pancakes ever tasted in my life. Bacon was great, and the eggs, ham and everything else were excellent as well.

The service was excellent and on point, and I enjoyed everything about my visit. I will certainly be going back again.

Ps. The Banana cream pie is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Even if I could leave zero stars I would still give one star because the poor server was doing her best and it's not her fault the food was abysmal. 

This was the worst meal I've had in years. I've dined at other locations and they were good to great. So either this location purposely served us the worst imaginable food or the kitchen was having a really off day. 

They messed up a 4 item omelette. Burnt the toast, didn't completely cook the country fried steak, skillet potatoes were cold and under cooked, the burger was rubbery and flavorless, the chicken sausage was inedible and I have had freezer burnt frozen waffles that had more flavor and personality than the abomination they served us and I the chicken parmesan was not recognizable as such. 

The water was wet so they managed not to ruin 100% of what was ordered."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite diners ever. I've been to this place numerous times and each visit I've loved the food. For this visit I got Trail pancakes and adjectives can not describe how excellent the food was. I would totally recommend the pancakes. A little tip: If you're going to order the pancakes, the pancakes are huge. It's a very adorable little diner too :) If I could, I would eat here every day but, that may not turn out well. I would totally recommend this place! 5/5!"}
{"text":"We ate at one of this chain's restaurants in California last year, and while the portions were huge, and the food was okay, it wasn't anything special, in my opinion. I felt the same way after trying this one too.

My wife loved her barbecued chicken salad with chipotle dressing, and I had the shrimp and tri-tip steak combo. There was nothing to complain about, but it just didn't set off any fireworks in my taste buds. If Terry wanted to go back, I'd say okay, but I don't think I'd make the suggestion."}
{"text":"One of my good ole comfort food spots :-) I try to eat healthy but sometimes you just want a big chicken fried steak and eggs for breakfast and this place has a great one!"}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner is SOOOOOO good. If you like BIG portions for a good price this is the place. The breakfast is off the chart! I always order The Grizz....Pancakes are amazing, made with like a sweet cream or something. The club sandwich is delicious also. You CANNOT go wrong by eating here. The servers are also very nice. You can tell there are some regular patrons and there is a friendly family atmosphere. I'm sure kids will love all the little teddy bears decorating the place inside. Seems like hundreds lol! Great food, great place"}
{"text":"The food is always great. I got the sweet cream waffle and it was delish. This is more of a soft waffle with not a lot of crunch but big flavor. The thick cut bacon is a delight too. Get a side of bacon just because. You need to try it for yourself and I bet you'll be hooked. The carpet is really filthy but other than that a clean environment. Wait staff was a bit slow today but manager must of had a talk with our waitress because second half of breakfast was much better."}
{"text":"Been going here regularly for over a year now. Joined their rewards club. The rewards sign in doesn't work most of the time. I earned 10 dollars off last time and could not use it because their machine did not work. Wanted to use it this time, but it was not working yet again. The lady up front said they are not going to fix it and will be taking it out. I asked about my 10 dollars and she told me to contact the maker of the machine because they have nothing to do with it.????  It is in the diner and they promote it??? I asked the manager and he said they was nothing he could do. They do not care at all about customer service. I won't be going back. Their vegetable have been extremely overcooked and the last time I got biscuits and gravy, the biscuits were hard and the gravy was all pepper. Food quality has gone down and so has the service."}
{"text":"This was my second time dining with this company. The first time I ate at another location but wasn't impressed.  I went back because some friends from work where going there for lunch.  I'm happy to say that I really liked my chicken club and my friends all enjoyed their meals.  Vast improvement from my first experience.  The staff were awesome. Our waitress rocked.  She was happy smiling and was on top of it.  Our glasses were never in need of water nor were my friends cups ever void of coffee.  Big portions and great French fries.  I love the super fast service!  It's so important when you're on your lunch break.  We split the bill which they had no problem doing and we're heading back to work with a belly full of goodness.  I will come back to this location again.  Thank you for a great experience."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, and large portions. I grabbed the turkey pesto sandwich with onion rings and it could've easily been two meals. The desert menu looked good, but didn't have a chance to try it. The place seems to keep a twenty minute wait time, so try and call ahead or plan accordingly."}
{"text":"We could eat here every day of the week. The food is great and the service is too. I've never had a bad experience. The pancakes are the best and I highly recommend the Hobo Omelet. We usually come for breakfast, but have been here for dinner too."}
{"text":"Leaving vegas today and wanted to leave on a high note so why not come back here right . The service at this place is marvelous top notch. Now today the cooks were off their game I ordered the 2 egg breakfast no meat. I don't like heavy food when I travel. I ordered two poached eggs and one pancake and fruit. The pancake was ok nothing special the fruit actually tasted good now my poached eggs are another subject not only were they overcooked but when I got them they were sitting in water in an ramekin now imagine if you weren't paying attention and dumped that on your plate of fluffy pancake yup messed up pancake lucky for me I pay attention to my food . I don't know if I'm going to come back to B.B.D. but I think I will stick to lunch idk."}
{"text":"Heeeeeey there Boo boo, do you want to go go go to Black Bear Diner?   No Yogi, I raided the camp site, and ate that Chinese family's cat.    Well, Boo boo just stay in the den, and I\"m going going going, and let mother nature carry you on her own.    Yogi, I think Mother Nature is kind of cranky today, but carry on and tell about your adventure to Black Bear Diner when you get back to the den.

Pawing my way into this place on my own, because the reason above and I also had to take my mom to a prearranged medical procedure up the street.    Actually traveling to this place for breakfast is like crossing the Yellowstone park for me, because it's not short trip from Henderson.     

There a nice cabin feel to the dining room when you walk in, and at the hostess station has  a  nice display of mini pies in a small refrigerated display case,   Those pie would be been cleaned out of the case if Boo Boo was here.   The interior is surround by hundreds of teddy bears, and a few collectible toys from a few generations before hand. 

Well, I sat down and looked at a menu, and that darn menu could doubled as the Yellowstone Gate newspaper, because it had a rather large selection of breakfast, lunch and dinner items.    It took a few minutes to decide what to eat, and the waitress who had five other tables was running slight attitude like Ranger Smith on a bad day.    Perhaps, I just wanted to keep her waiting a little longer, but I really couldn't decide what to eat, after all it was my first time eating here.    Well, I gave up, and asked my waitress for her advice, The Bigfoot chicken fried steak or the Grizz?    At that point, she mellowed out, and said their specialty is Chicken fried steak, and Bigfoot is the signature dishes.    Chalk one up for the chit, and put the order in doll face.

Under three minutes later, my pancakes and main dishes is served!   Wow, that was way too fast, and holy smokey bear this order was huge!   At first, I was a little confused...three minutes to make this order?   Well, I hammered the pancakes, and it was pretty good.  Not the best I ever had, but it was about 7.5 out of 10, and this was the best thing about this meal.   As for my chicken fried steak, it was pre-made, and didn't have that nice crunch when you bit into it.    The gravy was okay, but didn't have that slight sausage flavor, and I hate saying this but I had better at a few mom and pop places around town.   The egg were done right on the spot, and the hash brown was very good. 

That morning, I was a rogue bear running amok, and setting a bad example for the other animals, but this review is one of them.    It wasn't a bad visit but it wasn't a great one either, the size portion Black Bear gives are enough for a family buffaloes or one huge Hawaiian bear like bruddah IZ (which I'm not), but what threw off this visit was the waitress (who might have gotten too many tables) and questionable speed of my meal.   I rather wait for a fresh batch of chicken fried steak, than to get it in three minutes.    Did Boo Boo miss out...nope, but they can decide for themselves on Yes or No when they visit Black Bear, and so should you."}
{"text":"BEST place for breakfast! They have the best pancakes I have ever tasted. Great prices, huge portions. Friendly staff. Johnathan is our favorite server!"}
{"text":"We were on vacation here and had a group of six.  Everyone loved the huge breakfast.  Omelets with hash browns or red potatoes.  Good service and not too long of a wait.  Nice roomy booths and tables for big parties.  Love the bear den theme.  I heard it can be a longer wait on the weekends."}
{"text":"Good not great as hype suggests. Fresh oj was a nice touch. Decor a bit too grandma's menagerie like."}
{"text":"Pretty good, coffee was decent, food was grubable and staff was nice. Highly recommend the blackberry bear claw. Only draw back was a bit of a wait from food order till service... About 40 mins"}

Every employee greeted us with a kind word and friendly smile. 
I wish one of these would open up in St. Louis, Mo. I'd go all the time!
Since we were first timers, we were offered a home made pie..........YES PLEASE!!!!
A Big Thank You to Marlene and her Crew!!!

{"text":"very disappointed with the service took 20 mins to get our drink order in and had to ask who our server was. we wanted soup and half a sandwich at 12:30 they said we are still doing breakfest so we then orederd the turkey sandwiched it was dried out had to return it"}
{"text":"Service was great for a Sunday morning. Had steak and eggs and side of biscuits and gravy. Hash browns no taste to starchy, steak was dry for a medium rare and tuff biscuit taste floury the gravy had no taste. Guess menu is for people with no taste. May give it another shot but not Sunday too busy"}
{"text":"Came here twice. First off... The pancakes! Oh my lord. Best pancakes in my life! Made with sweet cream and buttermilk! So good! Bacon was market cut (stupid thick). Eggs are on point! The hash browns... perfectly cooked. Only problem... No sweet tea. Only Arnold Palmers... Tragic. But everything was amazing. People were super friendly. Cindy Rae was our waitress and was so nice!"}
{"text":"After having heard so much about this place for the last year or two I finally got to experience the Black Bear Diner today!

Items Ordered:

- Black Bear Burger w/pepper jack cheese ($14.59)
- Steak and Eggs ($13.99)
- Diet Pepsi ($2.59)

(+) I enjoyed the cheesy and fun decor! I got  kick out of all the bears strewn about the place, the jukebox, the cheesy little signs (ex: Bear feet allowed!) and all that! lol
(+) Maybe I got lucky, but our booth was clean and we received excellent and attentive service! From reading other reviews on here I was wondering how it would go and I have to say I was very pleased with the service received here!
(+) Generous portion sizes! Much larger portions than I was expecting! 
(+) Taking into consideration that this is a chain diner, I thought the food tasted good! The burger was big,fat,and juicy. The steak was nice and thick and tasted pretty good. You can't compare it to some of the steakhouses I've been to lately, but for a diner it is a very good steak!

They have a lot of different items on their menu that I eventually want to try(like their omelettes and other breakfast foods!) so we will be back! Plus someone had ordered a taco salad at the next table and that thing was freaking HUGE! Hell, it was bigger than my dog! Add that to the list too! I wanna try that!

4 stars

Yay! I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Sat us quickly, were accommodating of us having a 3 year old bouncing off the walls & the food was tasty. Can't ask for more from a busy breakfast place on a Saturday morning!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great food, huge portion sizes, some of the friendliest workers I've met, and they kept the coffee coming. Glad to have them in the neighborhood. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"We went to Black Bear Diner for dinner with some friends. It was the first time any of had been there. We all agreed we will be going back!

My wife ordered the chicken fried steak and it was VERY good. Another person and I ordered a combo of ribs and tri tip. The ribs were good (not great) but the tri tip was great. The other person at our table ordered prime rib. It was the special that night. It was ordered well done but came out medium. My friend sent it back and it was cooked some more.

We took deserts home because we were all full after dinner. My wife had bread pudding and I had a cinnamon roll. Both were very good and large enoug to share with our kids.

The service was friendly and fast. Except for the prime rib not being cooked to order the first time this would have rated 5 stars.

Next time we are in Phoenix we want to try breakfast at Black Bear Diner!"}
{"text":"Everyone seemed to be so excited that this was coming to the neighborhood. I finally tried it after a long while haha! But to be honestly, it was extremely lack luster. The food is very bland. The proportions are not proportionate. I got an omelette with hashbrowns on the side. The hashbrowns took up at least half of my plate, which is fine IF the omelette was bigger than the size of my closed fist. It was also extremely watery as well. Very unappetizing :( with so many great breakfast places near by, this place needs to step its game up."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but something changed.  The last 2-3 times I've been there the food just wasn't good.  Today everything seemed dry and it came out super fast...almost too fast which makes me wonder if most of it was already pre-cooked which would explain the dryness.  The coffee had a strong burnt taste and I was not able to drink it.  With recent new additions to Glendale's breakfast scene It would take something new and fresh for me to consider returning."}
{"text":"I went on Yelp one morning to find out where my boyfriend Don and I should have breakfast at. We wanted to go somewhere we've never been before and a place that was a local hot spot. I came across this place and (based on the reviews) it was a must.

We met up in the plaza around 9am. The place is pretty incognito on the outside. Because we live in Vegas, it just looked like another sports bar and grill to us. Don actually used to live down the street from the diner and I guess he never thought it was an awesome restaurant, judging on its low-key appearance. 

We were greeted and seated right away. Based on the personal conversations and waitresses knowing the customers' names, it seemed like there were a lot of regulars. That's how you know this pace is a local gem!

I ordered some coffee and Don ordered some oj. After perusing through the Black Bear Times Newspaper Menu, Don decided on the Country Fried Steak and Eggs and I opted for the 7-Grain Almond Granola Pancakes with a side of sausage links. Normally I'd get pancakes with chocolate chips or sweet toppings, but I decided on the 7-grain because the menu said that they were FAMOUS for them. 

Our plates came and they were pretty big. Good thing neither of us got the hungry bear breakfasts! Don's plate came with a giant biscuit that was perfectly crisp on the outside and warm and fluffy on the inside. It was soo delightful!  I didn't try any of his country fried steak or potatoes, but he finished the entire plate, which is a good sign!

My pancakes were delicious! I've never had anything like them. Normally when I order pancakes, I can't finish them, but this time I finished all three and the sausage links. They were perfect with the syrup and they weren't too dry or too mushy at all. The almonds gave them a very nice sweet taste and the grain/granola combo actually tasted awesome (sorry, I can't really explain!). It didn't taste as \"healthy\" as it sounds though, which was definitely a plus in my book! It probably was pretty healthy though, because I literally had to drive like a madman all the way home and run into my house just to use the bathroom. 

All in all, I love this place! It's a great place for breakfast and it is definitely a local gem. I really suggest you try the 7-Grain Almond Granola Pancakes if you're a fan of pancakes, because you will love them. The orange juice is fresh squeezed, which is hard to come across these days. Their coffee is also delicious and it comes with free refills of course!"}
{"text":"Clean, safe, family oriented place.  Too much food for one person.  The food was okay.  The prices was fair."}
{"text":"gotta check out this great breakfast lunch and dinner restaurant it's wonderful! The food is delicious and cooked to perfection! They have a great staff and are plenty friendly. Pull into Black Bear Diner for some good comfort food and freshly squeezed Orange Juice you won't be disappointed. Make sure you ask for Candice as she is always very kind."}
{"text":"All American classic comfort food diner style! It's enough food to feed a bear. I've always enjoyed the steak and eggs but didn't have the large appetite for it this time so half soup and salad for me. The chicken noodle soup was splendid and I had the turkey sandwich which was just enough and pretty average. Adam got the California Bacon Eggs Benedict which he also loved. 

There are so many options on this menu and everything is served all day. Personally, I have never had anything bad from any of their locations and I already have planned that next time I'm going to try the fried chicken. 

I give it 5 stars because the service is always above average and I've always enjoyed the food immensely. Plus the portions are very generous. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place!  Very cute beary decor. Great service and prices good. Made my vacation a little cheery."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and hostess was so thoughtful, as we were waiting for another couple to join us and it was early. As more folks came in, she recognized and asked if we wanted to be seated. Server was equally friendly and patient. I love that they have some lighter options as I know the normal portions are large. Other couple had never been to a Black Bear Diner and they really enjoyed it as well. Not sure about the negative reviews, ours was very positive. I loved my tuna salad. The others had burger baskets and really enjoyed them as well."}
{"text":"We mossed on in just before closing. We weren't all that sure that we'd be received well or that we'd good service. We were wrong.  The server was a sweetheart. She made sure that we got everything that we needed and brought out some things to us that were mistakes that she was in the process of \"fixing\". The few folks dining here when we arrived definitely noticed my daughter. She waved at all of them and they waved back.  She walked to a few folks to give high fives, hugs, and kisses.  The patrons are all so nice. Some of them chatted with me and my husband.  Our food came and it was on!  We jumped into our food and I doubt we came up for air til it was all gone. Everything was delicious. We were super duper extra hangry, but we've been here a few times to know that their food has been consistently tasty and fresh. The value is great for our little family of 3. I wanted to get a bear claw but we didn't have any way to store it and we were just too full.  The restrooms are well maintained here, yay!  The cashier is friendly and is on topi of it.   Everyone seems to do their part and pick up for others where they can. I guess you could say that this is like any other diner but for us, it's our first choice. Be sure to take a photo with the bears outside. With each location that we have been to, we take a photo with the bears and my daughter. Fun. I know this also sounds nutty but joining their email club, you can get some pretty good coupons in there."}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner is off the strip, but worth taking a cab from your hotel if you are visitng Vegas. It has a homey feel away from the craziness of Vegas.

It has all your staple breakfast foods, great coffee and great service.  I had the french toast, fruit and scambled eggs and it was OK.  

It was good enough that I would go back.  I would rather take a 10$ cab then pay for a $50 all you can eat buffet.

I mean no one wants to eat $50 dollars worth of food then go to a pool party..."}
{"text":"We love black bear diner. We were driving 30 min every week a for breakfast date, but now this location has open (conveniently 3 min from home!) we had to try it. Black Bear Diner you never disappoint, food was great as always, service on point and bacon was amazing Thank you for a great meal, fast service and all round wonderful experience. We will be back next week"}
{"text":"Food was really good as was the service large portions I had the veggie omelet it was nice and fluffy. The hash browns were cooked perfectly. Really liked the 3 choices of hot sauce on the table they were all good. Will be back soon"}
{"text":"This is a decent place to eat.  I had a BLT that was ok but not \"impressive\".  (Bacon is thicker.)  Salads looked great.  Chicken fingers looked like everywhere.  Breakfast options were huge.  Prices were more like diner style home--nice relief after the high prices on the Strip."}
{"text":"Outstanding little diner!  The staff was warm and attentive.  The food was delicious -- fresh and homemade.  We wished we had known about this place earlier in the week, as we would have eaten here a few times."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great sized servings.  I love a big meal and I always leave the Black Bear Diner feeling satisfied. Food is always top quality.  Staff is very friendly and professional. Never had any problems alway happy with my visits there."}
{"text":"Fresh squeezed orange juice... Check. Not many places offer this and it is a definate plus. Got the chicken fried steak with country potatoes. Very good and filling for the price. A frequent stop for me for breakfast on the weekends"}
{"text":"First time here last nite,it was great sevice she check on us, they greet us as walk in. Food was good we order fish and chip, fried chickenand,chicken fried steak and real good for the price."}
{"text":"Great variety of food! Portions were huge so you definitely will not go hungry. I got the corn beef hash with their potatoes. Delicious! Also the fresh squeezed orange juice was so good! Love the atmosphere in here. I am glad they built this one closer to me so I can enjoy it more often."}
{"text":"The food was horrible tonight. It was cold, country fried steak was over cooked and not edible, I found pasta in my mashed potatoes. Pasta! How is that even possible? The \"seasonal vegetable\" (frozen corn on the cob) was still half frozen. 
I took about 3 bites before my husband and I agreed that it wasn't worth it to get sick and left. $40 for nasty food. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and portions we're great. The service is where this place lacked. Our server Yolanda was mediocre at best. My drink cup was continuously empty and we were rarely checked on. When we were slowing down she asked if we were going to be on separate checks, we weren't even done and wanted dessert. But since she just asked about our checks we didn't get dessert. The thing that put us over the edge was when we were sitting talking and Yolanda comes over and says, \" Are you guys done done or.....\" So RUDE!!! Probably never coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service. And great food and prices. New to the area and have been looking for a regular spot for our family to eat when wanting to get out of the house...we found it here!"}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this place...now that I have I'm good, no special reason to come back.  I had a Waffel and to be honest it tasted like a pancake.  My wife had a BLT and I guess that was good.  Overall experience doesn't warrant a return visit...sorry black bear."}
{"text":"We passed by a Black Bear Diner in Laughlin, however did't have time to stop.  We decided to head to this Las Vegas location for breakfast this morning.  The atmosphere is fun, there are carved bears, teddy bears, painted bears, bears everywhere! I loved the decor.  The restaurant was an uncomfortable level of cool, unfortunately.  Our server was friendly, however came to check up on us rarely.  The portions were ample and the prices were very reasonable.  My husband's waffle had a cute bear paw!  Their coffee was better than a lot of breakfast diners and they offered french vanilla creamer, so that made me very happy.  The food comes quikly, but you will wait a while to order, as the serves have a very Hawaiian mentality.  Meaning, \"no worries\".  Anyone who has visited the Islands gets this reference.  I would definitely check out this spot if you are in town and want to head off strip.  It was a good meal overall.  I would likely return."}
{"text":"My mother and I decided to grab some breakfast, but wanted to try something else other than our routine Omelet House and Blueberry Hill stop so we decided to give this place a try. I had their corned beef hash, French toast (which is delicious by the way), and sausage links. For the hash. I'm used to just cracking open a can of that store bought, salty stuff for breakfast and theirs was far different from that. They use their own corned beef which is great and you can taste. My most favorite however is the French toast here so far. I could eat plates and plates of it. There's nothing fancy to it, but for some damn reason it just makes me want more of it combines with syrup (Duh). They have desserts that you can have with your breakfast as well. I didn't have any of the desserts, but they do seem good. Rumor is however that the banana split pie is most popular there. So if any of you guys have it, \"Please do review on it!\" Other than thee above its a chill place to have breakfast if you want a good, simple, and delicious home cooked breakfast. The service was great as well and our waiter was very helpful to us so I really don't have room to complain about this place. \"Give it a try!\""}
{"text":"Meh. It's like a substandard Denny's. Staff isn't great but the foods not good either.  The decor is a joke and the coffee is weak."}
{"text":"Date dined 2/21/2015 I have tried this place for breakfast in St. George, Utah and was so excited when they were going to open one in Henderson, NV. My husband and I tried it for the first time on a Saturday morning for breakfast. It wasn't busy, which I was happy because we got seated right away. 

I ordered the special, spinach and mushroom eggs benedict and my husband ordered the corned beef hash and eggs.  I was surprised how long the food took, when it wasn't busy at all. There had to of been maybe 7 tables with customers. What was the most disappointing, was the food was cold when it came to my table. I was so hungry because it took so long, I didn't bother to return it.

I will go back and give them another chance. I hope to not have to complain about the food being cold."}
{"text":"I felt compelled to write a review. Hoping management sees it. I notice this location is emptier than other Black Bear Diners. 

So... food is good as expected. Food is always on point at Black Bear. 

Our waiter, Brandon, was very good, attentive, etc. 

However... we had two instances where we interacted with a woman named Andrea (it was on her name tag)... and they were very negative. 

Her attitude was so negative I'm not sure we want to go back. She was behind the counter when we first walked in and sort of scowled at us instead of being welcoming. 

Later, there was a slight error on my mom's order (they put gravy on her turkey sandwich when she had asked her not to)... no big deal, but Andrea was the one who brought it out... when the error was brought up no, \"sorry\"... just a nasty look and an \"oh, we'll fix that.\"

(Brandon brought the new turkey and apologized profusely). 

So... we'll probably keep coming... but with so many good places to eat here in Vegas it's a tough sell until they get rid of nasty wet blankets like this Andrea lady."}
{"text":"I swear whoever is cooking in the kitchen must be the fastest cook in the West, since it was barely over five minutes from when I placed my breakfast order to my waitress that I got my food. And it was hot. Not warm. Hot. And it was delicious! Bacon, eggs, hash browns and a biscuit for me, eggs, a waffle, and bacon for my mom. She raved about the waffle, and it did look really good. The little bear claw imprint on the top of it was adorable. And this place's bacon is so good. Actually, everything I've ever gotten from this location has been delicious. It hurts my heart when I don't finish my plate but I leave too little to take home. This place gives you such big portions it's so hard to finish a plate. Not finishing a good meal feels like an insult to me. Top it off with the nice, friendly service and its a great place to stop by for when I'm in the mood for a sit-down dinner. That and the prices are quite easy on the wallet."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast options and quality. Prices are what breakfast prices should be. The staff is extra friendly and very attentive. I will become a regular."}
{"text":"I mean it's a chain diner. So nothing is really over the top good, it's either A-OK or Meh. My experience here was just OK. 

During the main brunching times this place is packed and I mean lines out the door. It's largely a family and grandparents dining place so don't expect people to eat quickly or things to be super flavorful. I chose to sit at the counter, which was empty and gave me a first hand look at chaotic food runner station.

I ordered a specialty Black Bear Benedict, a benedict with shredded pork and prepared in the Huevos Rancheros style. This was ok and the portion was huge, so big in fact that I didn't finish it, which is really saying something, but massive portions don't necessarily mean massive flavor. This was lacking in the spice and salt area, hence a diner fit for grandma and the kids. 

The service here was attentive and surprisingly quick during their busy brunch service. The one thing I did notice was small pile of trash that had been left by the previous eater at the counter. My server walked by it at least four times before a busser who was dropping off glasses noticed it and cleaned it up. Not a major thing, but what if that had been old food and not paper straw covers and napkin bits? 

If you enjoy bland food and crying babies in the distance than this is the place for you. Sorry Black Bear Diner I just don't get it, but maybe when I'm 65 I'll call this place home."}
{"text":"Just finished a late lunch and our experience was fantastic. Had the sourdough parmesan burger which was cooked exactly how i ordered it. Our waitress Marlene was extremely attentive and kind, brightened my day up having such pleasant person with a big smile take care of us.  My new favorite local eatery, will def be back!"}
{"text":"Step away from the Denny's! This place offers an awesome breakfast, not too far from the strip.

Pancakes were fluffy and creamy good, and the standard eggs and sausage were delivered fast and hot. My husband ordered an eggs and sausage breakfast with FIVE big links of sausage--breakfast meat heaven.

Very kitschy decor with bear stuff all over the place, and the crowd here seemed full of locals more than tourists."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and it was pretty solid! The inside feels like a log cabin with a bunch of cute bear decor. It was kind of slow when we went around 3 but picked up by the time we left. Service was good, I felt bad for our server since it looked like he got triple sat and since it seemed like he was the only server at the moment in the restaurant with over 10 tables so he was running around everywhere definitely weeded. But he was still really nice and was able to keep our waters filled and checked up on us often :)
As for food, I understood that they had big portions but oh my goodness everything was MASSIVE! I had the Chicken Fried Steak and it came with eggs, hashbrowns, and a biscuit. I think they kept with the bear theme and made the biscuit the size of a bear cub paw! This thing was enormous lol The fried steak was decent flavor, I didn't really care or their style of hashbrowns since it didn't really stay together and wasn't really seasoned well but the eggs and biscuit were solid, biscuit being way too dense for my taste. My boyfriend had The Grizz, their signature breakfast and that normally comes with hamsteak, 2 sausage links, 2 pieces of bacon, eggs, hashbrowns, and a side of Sweet Cream Pancakes but he subbed the ham steak for some sourdough toast. The bacon and sausage was really good and the sweet cream pancakes were tasty since they had a nice sweetness to it but they were pretty heavy. They were really moist and had a cakelike consistency.  My boyfriend also got fresh squeezed orange juice and that was really good as well but kind of pricey in my opinion at $4.99 since my entire meal was $9.99. I also liked that they had 4 different styled hot sauces on the table named Mama Burn, Papa Burn, Baby Burn and Crazy Cuz haha so cute! I like Mama Burn the best since it was a Chipotle hot sauce. Total was about $29 before tip so pretty good pricing for the enormous amount that you get. I would definitely share an entree next time or get one of their lighter options. Overall, pretty solid, left me in a happy food coma, glad that I have Black Bear Diner as another option around this area :)"}
{"text":"I have driven past black bear diner at least 1000 times before I finally decided to stop inside and give it a go.  I can't believe I just discovered this gem, as it is only .3 miles from my house.  

I am a huge water and breakfast food fanatic and Black Bear did not disappoint!! I ordered the corn beef hash, eggs, and cinnamon roll French toast and it was easily the most delicious breakfast meal I've had in years.  

The corn beef hash was authentic and \"home made\" (not out of a can) and cinnamon roll French toast was incredible.  The service was great, portions were huge, and the food was relatively inexpensive.  I will definitely be hitting this up at least once a week."}
{"text":"One word - YUM. The portions are pretty ginormous and the prices are way fair. My husband and I got out of here for cheaper than a visit to IHOP and were way more satisfied. I had \"The Grizz\" which was (I think) 2 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 sausage, a ham steak portion, hash browns or home fries and 2 pancakes. My scrambled eggs were perfectly cooked. The bacon was thick and cooked well. I'm not a fan of breakfast sausage so I got a double helping of bacon instead so I can't comment on the sausage. The ham was the one thing on my plate that was Ew. It was grilled, but it just tasted like charcoal grill marks. And the texture was funky. It was just not appetizing at all. And the pancakes. Ohhhhhh.... the pancakes. They required no syrup at all. The recipe must have a lot of sugar in it because they were super sweet. It was almost like eating a piece of cake, rather than a pancake. I saved my pancakes for last and ended up not being able to eat them so I took them home and enjoyed them cold, later on. My husband had the Bigfoot Chicken Fried Steak and it was just sorta \"meh\". Nothing special and actually tasted too greasy. I could taste more oil than meat which wasn't good. I wouldn't recommend it personally. 

Yes, it's a chain. No, the service wasn't the greatest. No, it was nothing fancy or gourmet. It was just regular old breakfast food done really well! I would just really suggest the pancakes! Nummers."}
{"text":"This is my favorite diner on earth. I took a Vegas pal there who had never been and he was shocked he didn't know about it. Everything is fresh. You know how when your order blueberry pancakes in some diners the berries are basically jam or preserves? These are FRESH. You can set aside the menu, not even look at it, and just order what you want and they probably have it. Cooked clean and garnished nicely. What's not to like? I wish we had one in NYC. I've also been to another Black Bear in Silicon Valley and loved that one too."}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner- Sahara! So glad I found you after many referrals from friends and coworkers! 

For my Mother's Day Brunch with the Fam, you didn't disappoint! 

The food was scrumptious!! Big portions for hungry appetites and wallet friendly for a family friendly find! 

At a glance! This was a restaurant for Highway Diner Heaven, where your server is a jolly drama misfit with a messy hair do... For-real Tho! Every girl had a messy bun or pony on their head I almost thought it was a prerequisite for hire!  


But on to the good stuff! The ORANGE JUICE!! If there was anything on the menu that I thought was a lil pricey it was the OJ- until my first sip!! Ha! Fresh Pressed Juice with my breakfast- Yes Please! Smells so good when they make a fresh batch too! 

Food: I had the Cinnamon Roll French Toast and Chicken Apple Sausage with scrambled eggs!! No complaints over here! It was delicious. 

Notable mention- the cream cheese drizzle has almond extract in it so fair warning for those looking to avoid. But! Topping it with syrup tastes divine too!! 


The Hubby's meal: The ScramBowl! Very tasty especially if you like to dowse everything breakfast related in Yummy Sawmill gravy! Beware of the large sliced Jalapenos tossed inside, so if you are not a fan of heat ask to opt out. 


Service: Fast and Friendly! We ordered the little a Mini Volcano first (2 pancakes, Eggs, 1 Sausage, 1 bacon) Yes, that's was a kids meal! It came out quickly, just time for the hungry one. 

Fun Find: Their menus are newspaper... how Nostalgic is that! Nothing says country breakfast at the kitchen table than everyone looking the newspaper to decide what to eat! :)


Overall, great food, nice service and happy with our visit! We'll be back!


Last call: You will need a BOX!"}
{"text":"The portions here are pretty big and the service is great! We've heard so many people rave about this place and now we understand why! It was Delish! If your in the Goodyear area this place is a breakfast grand slam! Make sure to stop by! (I also got a free meal for my birthday for signing up with them, which we thought was nice.)"}
{"text":"I was completely blown away by the portion sizes at Black Bear Cafe! My fiancée and I each ordered something different to share (see pics), and we could have easily shared just one of the meals and had our appetites fully sated. Wait staff was friendly and attentive. Overall had a great experience, even on return visits!"}
{"text":"Visiting LV and was doing some shopping at the outlets. Getting late so I decided to just eat around here. This Black Bear Is newer than others I've been to... food was just as good. Pot roast excellent and potatoes and gravy were yummy. This was the small size. Excellent service."}
{"text":"Everyone wanted something different so this diner fit the bill!  Food was yummy, veggies fresh, dressings homemade and everyone left full and happy and close to closing when things normally decline. Not here. Anthony was our server and he was friendly and took good care of us."}
{"text":"This was our first time to the restaurant, as we are visiting for the weekend. My wife had the California omelette and I had the seven grain pancakes. The food was delicious with very good sized portions. Our waitress, Cathy, was wonderful. She was attentive, friendly, and told us about a Black Bear Diner that has recently opened in our hometown of Tucson, AZ. We had an excellent experience and definitely will be back. Strongly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner does not disappoint. I've had breakfast here twice and plan to have dinner here later this week. The portions are massive and the food is super tasty. Great-tasting coffee too. Staff is always friendly and efficient. So happy to see a restaurant at this location by the Green Valley Library that will succeed."}
{"text":"Found this very nice family diner and stopped by to have lunch.  The staff were very friendly.  The food was very delicious.  Portions are very ample.  Facilities are clean and spacious."}
{"text":"The bear claw & coffee were yummy but the service was awful.  The fastest way to ruin your Business is to a slow, lousy wait staff.  The hostess was busy seating customers and bussing tables.  The waitress was no where for about 15 min.    Your only as good as your management and obviously they don't care."}
{"text":"On our way home last night with our foster girls! Of course they wanted McDonald's or Taco Bell! Need to get that fast food thought out of them. So we stopped here. Wife and I have been here a few times. We have always enjoyed the food here. But last night! Don't know if they had a off night? Or our taste buds have moved on? Should have listen to the six year old and gone to Taco Bell! When we first got there, I wanted to order breakfast. But i have been on some kind of Ribs kick for the last three months?? So i ordered a full rack of ribs, with fries, mixed vegi's, and broc and cheese soup! The best part of this meal was the soup, it was a little salty but it was very good. It also came with a piece of corn bread. The ribs were very dry, I had to rip them off the bone, and very tough. And a day later, I am still feeling the effect! The vegi's and fries were good. I was able to get a taste of wife's waffle, again i was not that impressed! Very soggy, even before the syrup was poured is was not crispy, to soft, i just didn't like the texture on it. The girls had chicken fingers, and pancakes. Seem they both liked their meals very much. Now all four of us shared their Mt.Shasta Lava Cake, this cake sounded great according the their menu it said.
 \"Our homemade chocolate cake has a gooey chocolate lava center, served hot and topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and chocolate drizzle. Perfect for chocolate lovers!\"

We were very disappointed It was just a dried up piece of chocolate cake, with chocolate sauce on the bottom and top, with ice cream on top. Not very good, not what we were expecting. Not sure if we will come back here? There are just to many options to eat at."}
{"text":"Quick Look: Not exactly a classic \"diner\" that someone from the Northeast (like myself) would be accustomed to. Someone said a \"country kitchen\" in another review and that is spot-on. Let's just say it's a country-diner w/ decent enough food. 

In Depth Review: Walked in on a Saturday at 8pm and was greeted by a friendly hostess and a pie display case that sounded like the motor was on it's last leg and needed some WD-40. I asked to be sat away from that noise. They sat us in a back corner table near the kitchen, the floor underneath was covered in food debris from previous diners. Not the best first impression. I am not going to lie, I was nervous at this point. 

Waitress seemed friendly and took our drink orders. We each ordered the Arnold Palmer (iced tea / lemon-aid / strawberries) and they were delicious. The lady ordered the corned beef and hash breakfast and I ordered the grilled chicken and avocado club sandwich with a side of fries. Took about 15 minutes for our food to make it to the table. Side note: during this time I used the bathroom. The man's bathroom was quite the site. The toilets were disgusting. The vent system was making an awful screeching noise in the ceiling above and the light was flickering. Was the perfect creepy setting for an 80's horror flick. I was really nervous at this point and got out of there fast! 

The food arrived and the portions were HUGE! They certainly feed you here. My wife loved the corned beef and hash and scarfed down a good amount. She's tiny and I was impressed. My chicken club sandwich looked great but was not up to par in the taste department. The chicken was overcooked and dry. The bacon was hard as a rock. I am certain the bacon was not cooked fresh and was cooked earlier in the day and just slapped on the sandwich to expedite the kitchen process. On a positive note, the french fries were AMAZING! 

So it was a mixed bag with our first experience here. The bill was cheap and I can understand why so many senior citizens were eating here. Saves them and anyone on a fixed income money. The food was decent enough, just not over the top impressive. 

In Summary: I have been missing the Greek Diners that I grew up going to in New York. The massive Lemon Meringue pies that are about a foot tall in the display cases up front. The club sandwiches, steak fries, milkshakes, fresh coffee and all day long breakfast at the counter w/ your neighbors. Was hoping that the Black Bear Diner would satisfy my diner itch, but sadly it did not."}
{"text":"OMG.......I used to dine at this location when it was Chili's......What a far cry from the Black Bear Diner where I was greeted like a VIP when I walked in and was so lucky to have Tonya as my server......It just doesn't get any better than this.  Biscuits bigger than my fist oozing with fresh butter and Black Bear's special clover honey recipe!!!!!  To make this a total memorable experience, Stuart Leitner, the General Manager stopped by to check on me to make sure I was enjoying everything and I felt it imperative to tell him about Tonya's pristine service.  He sat down and we chatted and low and behold, it turns out we both worked for the same restaurant, same location but different dates.  Small world!!!!  Arnold S has said many times in the Terminator movies \"I'll be back!!!!\" for of this fantastic food.  Thanks Stuart and Tonya"}
{"text":"Loved coming here both times so far.

I got the biscuits and gravy last time, and the portions were very generous.

Food was warm when I got it, and the quality was amazing.

The menu has lots of options and it's not just the same bland options that every restaurant has.

Servers were nice and refilled drinks quickly."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Not a big drink selection but then again its a diner. But huevos rancheros was bomb"}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite places to eat growing up during our road trips. Love the bears everywhere and the food is great! We didn't wait long for our food. The servers were all really nice. We have a fussy (hungry) baby and they brought us some cut fruits for her. :)"}
{"text":"I eat here every time I'm on that side of town, the manager remembered me from a month prior which is crazy awesome, they definitely have wonderful food, friendly staff, and a great atmosphere. I've had four or five different items each time I've been there and I have never been disappointed yet, their chicken fried steak is huge and their biscuit is enormous. If you're in town you must try the Black Bear Diner."}
{"text":"This place just opened recently and you can tell they're still working the kinks out. I went here for breakfast. It was just me so maybe I was just overlooked. Seating and ordering were relatively fast and even the food wasn't a very long wait, but that's pretty much where the service stopped. I ate my eggs, bacon, and sausage. I was about to dig in to my mini volcano of pancakes when I realized I had neither butter nor syrup. I patiently drank my coffee thinking certainly the server would come around to ask how things were. Not dice. For fear my pancakes would get cold I got the attention of another employee walking by and requested the condiments. They were set on my table with a, \"Here,\" and no smile which was slightly off-putting. I don't need you to be my BFF, but a smile would have been a good step toward recovering from forgetting my stuff in the first place. The server brought my bill and that was it. The food was pretty good. Loved the pancakes, but I'm not clamoring to go back or anything. Hopefully this is just symptomatic of being new, but, like a first date, it's usually downhill from there. We'll see though. I say give it a shot and see what happens."}
{"text":"I will never return to this location EVER!! we tried this place in lake havasu a while back and found a few here in Vegas. Liked there food and staff was very friendly in havasu. However this location was a nightmare. The hostesses were running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Yelling at other employees from across the restaurant to tell busers to do other tables ( something that should probably be done in the back where a lobby full of customers can't hear). When we finally got seated it took FOREVER for our waiter to come and introduce himself, one of the hostess came to get a drink order from us before he came, when our drinks finally arrived my wife asked for creamer for her coffee and the waiter stood there and completely ignored her and just asked if we were ready to order. I said to him \"is that a no? Then he walked away and came back with creamer. I can not believe the service that this location provided, it was as if all the employees or just the ones we encountered didn't want to deal with being busy. Like I said I will not return and would never recommend this place."}
{"text":"First and foremost... Love their damn pancakes...

So yea, service isn't ALL THAT great but you get big portions. \"Best bang for your buck\" as they say.

Now they remodeled the place. Took out the over half of the bar/diner type seating and new seats. Still looks good in my opinion.

I say everyone should at least experience this place not once... But twice... Then you can make your decision on the place. I'm still going back :)"}
{"text":"We have been here many times and find the staff to be consistently friendly, the food to be consistently delicious and plentiful with good value for the price. 

I would recommend this place to anyone who is hungry and serious about eating.The bear motif is fun.

It's a great family restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great family place for breakfast lunch or dinner. Family type meals. Great for breakfast. Read the breakfast choices there are a lot more options then initially appear.
Great place for family couples or singles.
Downhome country atmosphere.
This one wasn't quite as busy as other ones."}
{"text":"It was pretty good diner food. I enjoyed it and looked at it for what it was. It is just like a lot of comfort food chains. It was good and The service was good. Good place to stop off to eat at. Exceptional Pancakes."}
{"text":"THE BEST BREAKFAST in Vegas. Skip other Buffets and low quality chain Breakfast chains. SERIOUSLY! I travel for work. It's the best here. TRY THE HASH. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Huge portions and consistently good food.  Be prepared for a wait during holidays and weekends.  They are a Pepsi product restaurant, so that adds another plus for me.  Always order the larger breakfast and take some home!  If possible, as for Ricki to be your server and you will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Service and food at this location are excellent. My last visit was on Easter Sunday. For it being a holiday and the restaurant being plenty busy, my sister and I waited less than 25 minutes to be seated. This went the same for the time we placed our order and received our food. If you want a better alternative to Denny's or IHOP, come to Black Bear Diner."}
{"text":"The restaurant is open and well laid out. The staff are friendly and quick. The menu is packed with the comfort foods."}
{"text":"Decent food and prices with big portions. 

Sign up for their eclub and get a free coffee and bear claw! 

I came here with 3 other friends and even though the server was busy, he was still nice and refilled our coffees and waters before they got too low. I had such a hard time choosing an item, but eventually with with the corned beef hash. The hash was extra crispy, just the way I like it and there was a good amount of corned beef in there as well. It came with a biscuit which I didn't care much for. It was kind of too hard for me, I prefer my biscuits on the light and flaky side. I brought half of it home and it was still good the day after!"}
{"text":"Since my last review I have been back to this location at least once a week... but no more. The quality of the food has really deteriorated. My hash brown came out luke warm at best and today I received a slice of ham that was about one third the size I have had in the past. Oh, did I forget to mention that my sour dough bread  was finally delivered 5 minutes into my meal. I had to continually ask for a refill as my server was too busy clowning around at the cash register. Then to add insult to injury when I paid at the cash register the young lady proceeded to yawn in my face...ridiculous!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, if I was just reviewing the food it would be 5 stars.  But I'm not just reviewing the food, the SERVICE HERE IS TERRIBLE.  An hour wait for a table, an additional hour wait AT the table to get our food and OUT of FOOD by the time we order dessert!!!  

We did expect a wait for a table because there were 14 of us!  But we called ahead of time to let them know we were coming!  & When we got there were told 20 minutes!  They kept giving tables away !    The kitchen NEEDS HELP!  It shouldn't take an HOUR to make CLUB SANDWICHES & BURGERS (which is what MOST of us ordered)  We had to beg for refills!  Not one visit from management to make sure everything was ok."}
{"text":"BUGS!!  We went 6/29 - food all over the floor, people next to us had ANTS all over their table (they didn't notice until they were leaving).  Manager blamed the customer, didn't bother to have the floor cleaned or even offer a free dessert.  
 Used to to to this location often, but not if everything is the customers fault & full of bugs!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for the first time on a Wednesday night about 7pm and there was no waiting time. We approached the front counter and there was a girl with one elbow propped up on the counter behind her and she said hi and I said there were 2 of us. She asked if we wanted a booth or table, and I replied we would like a booth. She proceeded to take 2 folded newpapers (which, upon our own investigation, we found to be the menus on the inside) and walk towards the first booth. She didn't mention we should follow her, but I figured we should when she went to the closest booth. She somewhat tossed the menus on the table and asked what we wanted to drink and said our waitress would be there shortly. Needless to say, our first impression of the restaurant was awkward, and we almost felt like we were intruding on them. Meeting our waitress wasn't much more pleasant. I honestly don't remember her name, but I would request, if we were to visit again, to not sit in her section. Here's the thing, I'm under the impression that if you want to make good money as a service person, you should be very pleasant. Our waitress was just nice enough to warrant a tip, but she was not very friendly or cheery. My husband and I are neither one hard to please in the least and we both were unhappy with the service. Every time I said thank you for whatever she was giving us, there was absolutely NO reply. Nothing. Some sort of acknowledgement would be nice that I spoke to you.

Now, on to the food. The sweet tea was great, and this is a hard thing to get an approval for from 2 southerners from Texas. My husband ordered the CFS with fries and green beans. The CFS was pretty good and the gravy was good. The fries were also good. The green beans were WAY overpowered by the onions in them. That's all you could taste, pretty much. I ordered the Mikey's chicken pot pie. It was pretty tasty, however, I wish it had been mentioned in the description of the contents that there were mushrooms in it. I don't care for mushrooms, so I dug through the pie to remove them, then enjoyed the rest of it. The crust and creaminess were great. We both started with salads, and those were good, too. My husband ordered the lava cake for dessert, and I had a few bites. It was also pretty good. 

At the end of the dinner, we went to the front counter, and again, was very briefly asked, by the same girl as before, how we liked it, and we replied that it was good. She took my credit card for payment and, instead of handing it back to me at the lower part of the counter, she placed it on the top counter (almost at eye level), handed me a pen and 2 slips from my transaction, and turned and walked away. Really?!?  There was no \"Thank you\" \"Get lost\" or even a word after. Again, my husband and I just felt like an inconvenience to them. This whole experience was just awkward and we felt unwelcome for sure. I wish we had been on the other side of the restaurant where the only cheery and happy and laughing waitress was. I saw no one else that worked there smile. Not even once. Our waitress barely broke a grin, for goodness sake!

Overall, I liked the food way more than the service, and that isn't saying much. There is supposed to be a new location opening in Henderson this fall. We will probably go eat breakfast at that location, but I don't think we will return to this location probably ever.

If I could have given this place a 1 1/2 stars, I would have. It's too bad since I really have been wanting to take my husband there for the sole purpose of him getting his beloved CFS (it's really hard to find a great southern style one to compare to back home in Texas). He was happy to get a pretty good one, but the experience was tainted by the unwelcome attitudes and faces we encountered. What a disappointment.  :/"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast place! After a night of drinking, this place has awesome experienced service, and fantastic food. Get the ho-made hash!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had breakfast at Black Bear diner this morning. She had the Volcano and I had the Grizz. Neither one of us could eat all of it but we wanted to taste everything they offered on those two dishes. Breakfast was awesome!
Everything was perfectly done especially the eggs which we both like over medium. The sweet cream pancakes are absolutely enormous and no way can you eat two of these at least we couldn't.  I chose the red diced cottage fries over the hashbrowns and was glad I did because they were superb! 
This was our first visit there but we definitely will go back.  The service was outstanding and even though it was Sunday morning and every table was filled we were seated right away at a booth near the window-the only seating left.
The place is bright, very clean  and cheerful looking and has a great ambience.  We decided this would be our new breakfast place because there are so many more things on the menu that we're going to try.  Definitely a five star review."}
{"text":"Eating solo at the counter in this rustic diner. Had coffee (OK, nothing special) and a blueberry waffle with soft butter, whipped cream and maple syrup. REAL blueberries and real whipped cream! Not some high fructose syrup concoction. The waffle was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside and hot enough that butter melted on contact! Yea!

Service was prompt and friendly. The coffee cup was kept topped up and the creamer was real half and half. There is a mix of counter seating, tables and chairs, and booths. The dining area is divided into several distinct area with one area enclosed and cleverly named the \"Bear Cave.\"

Parking is close to the door. Prices are average for the diner genre. The waffle, berries and whipped cream, and unlimited coffee came to $11 with tax and before tip. If in the area, I would love to stop at lunch or dinner and try items from those menus."}
{"text":"Sweet cream pancakes and spicy sausage patties. So good! Flower provided wonderfully charming service. There was a bit of a wait but be patient; it's so worth it!"}
{"text":"Great place for our weekly meeting. Janna takes great care of us. They have good breakfast and lots of choices.They come as close to a diner as you can get in Arizona."}
{"text":"What a great find.  Had lunch with a customer of mine today and he suggested this diner up the road that his wife tried. So - the four of us head over to the Black Bear Diner in Gilbert, AZ.  

We walk in and the first comment made was that this joint looked like a Denny's with bears.  Hey - it is cutesy with baby bears painted on the walls, bear menu holders and bear paraphernalia all over.

Let's get off the bear subject and focus on why I liked this place.  The food.  I love a really good taco salad.  95% of the ones I get while eating out are lousy. The one at this diner had a fresh warm crisp yet flakey shell.  And it was not greasy.  It was filled with rice, refried beans, perfect avocado, sour cream, tomatoes and jalapenos.  It was perfection.  Even the crust stayed crisp without getting grossly soggy.  The taco beef on top was wonderful with the grated cheddar.

My business associates each enjoyed their food.  The waitress was super nice and this joint was very well priced.

I will definitely be coming back.  Soon I hope!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Wonderful! We will be returning to this diner everytime we go to Vegas. First place we went to when we got there, last place right before we left since it is so close to the car rental place and airport. The food is wonderful and you get good sized portions. Definitley recommend the 12oz rib-eye. The staff is nice and friendly and we had Barbara as our waitress. She was such a delight. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We have come here for years for breakfast and things have definitely gone down hill. Over cooked food, skimpy portions, and server didn't do much to try to fix it. Plus it was not worth the 25 min wait. Save your money and time and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've only ever been here for breakfast, but the servers are always nice and the food is awesome. It's comfort food, for sure, and they give you huge portions! If you haven't tried this place out, it's definitely a sound alternative to your normal breakfast place!
I'm sure their lunch/dinner items are just as tasty!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and had good food and service both times. The pancakes are delicious. Probably the best I have ever had. Fresh squeezed oj. Coffee and breakfast meats are alright. Decent sized portions. You will leave full."}
{"text":"First time ever coming here and I can definitely say I will be coming back. My husband and I were greeted warmly. We sat at the bar and our waitress Trina was extremely helpful and friendly. She made sure we were content and had great attention to detail. Thank you Trina"}
{"text":"Came to eat lunch with my boyfriend and I got bacon and cheddar stuffed burger with French fries and he got big foot country fried steak and eggs with the side of 2 cream cakes . Food turned out amazing it was delicious! Our waitress was very nice and helpful. My burger was on point very tasteful. The portions are very big and will fill you up. The only thing I wish was different was if the prices were a bit cheaper. other then that this place is amazing !!!!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast/brunch. Good for family. We had a large group that they easily accommodated. It was loud and the background music was even louder than I expected. We will go back and try lunch and dinner items."}
{"text":"Had a turkey club today for lunch. Was a big portion and so filling. Tarissa and Lynn were very helpful and I enjoyed my stay! Will definitely be back for more great tasting food:)"}
{"text":"Ordered take out for this place for the first time just to try their food and the food was meh.
We ordered: chicken tortilla soup, pot roast with fries, chicken pot pie (came with salad with ranch dressing, and peach cobbler. 
When I went inside to go pick up the food my first impression was like whoa...it's so country in here..Decor is kind tacky. They have displays of their pies at the front and it looked like it's been sitting in there for days. I kinda almost wanted to tell  someone there to take our peach cobbler order out but by that time one of the servers came out with our food.
Chicken pot pie was OK but nothing amazing. It's kinda like the ones you could get from the frozen section at Target or something. Pot roast was my least favorite...it had a weird flavor and taste to it and the veggies were hard! Also, the fries were really soggy. Salad was just salad, it was just chopped up lettuce, cucumbers and carrots....with ranch dressing...WHOO~! The peach cobbler was definitely a couple days old and not fresh. You can tell by just looking at it. Overall, the best thing I would say was the chicken tortilla soup but they forgot to give me tortilla chips ugh! I dunno about breakfast but dinner here is definetly not somewhere I would wanna go."}
{"text":"Wow Really good morning at Black Bear for Breakfast good service good Value Amazing Biscuits !!"}
{"text":"I love Black Bear Diner! In whatever state they make their food the same...DAMN GOOD! 

Everytime I come to Vegas I find myself stopping here for breakfast. Everyone knows everyone in this place. Unfortunately, I'm just a visitor from out-of-town so nobody ever knows who I am. BUT THE FOOD IS STILL SUPER DELISH!!!"}
{"text":"I have to say, my experience was bear-riffic!!!

Black Bear Diner, was pretty much easy to find.  On the corner of Tropicana and Jones, you can see it right off the road.  The location, is a good location to find this diner.  From the looks of it, it has that wilderness look and a set of wooden bears outside, which I thought it was cute, but of course that wasn't the only cute thing about it.  Walking inside, we were greeted promptly and was seated right away.  The really cute part of it, is all these stuff bears all around you.  Kind of brings back the childhood days, when I had a stuff bear.  It really put a smile on my face to think that.  

We went there, early lunch, which I had my doubts on service.  Cause usually when its the beginning of lunch, I usually assume slow service.  But it was a bit surprising that it wasn't as busy as I thought it would be and the service was prompt.  From the point we were seated to a waitress asking what we would like to drink, was just a matter of seconds.  I was very impress that they were ready and willing to take our orders.  Unfortunately I wasn't ready and needed a minute, but after I was done and put down my menu, there was our waitress, who is ready to take our order.  Well, she was talking to another customer, but really surprise that she came to our table right away, after the fact that I just put down the menu.  

I was debating on the Taco Salad or New York Steak.  They both sound good and tasty, but decided to go with the New York steak and eggs.  I'm sure the Taco Salad, would of been great, but I'm glad that I went with the steak.  It was well done to my satisfaction and presented very well.  I basically ate the whole thing, and a slice of toast.  Hoping I would of went with dessert, but I was full and satisfied with the steak.  I'm sure dessert would of been great.  

Over all, I was very satisfied with my visit, and recommend this to anyone who is very hungry, like  a bear.  Even though, you may not be hungry like a bear, you got to check this place out.  Sure enough, you will not be disappointed.  Especially if you love plush bears on the ceiling, that got to put a smile on your face at least."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The people who work there are just wonderful Friendly, efficient, funny and fast.   Boyfriend had a burger and fries,and ice cream sundae, and I had a Tuna salad.  Everything was nice and fresh,   fairly priced, and served with a smile.  What else could you ask for ?
Great neighborhood Diner."}
{"text":"This place always exceeds my expectations. The food was on time and delicious our server was great I never wanted for water or refills of coffee. I eat here often for dinner and I was like the quality and the healthiness of the food this time we had breakfast and the corned beef hash was delightful something different than I was used to but totally surprised and enjoyed every bit of it."}
{"text":"Great little diner! Been many many times in several states and locations. 

This location, Tropicana and Jones, recently remodeled the interior and fixed up some things on the menu. The chicken pot pie is new and improved and very good, before it was weird so happy for this change. Chicken fried steak is on point, real good green beans, and turkey dinner. 

Why not a 5 star? Could be more consistent. Service is usually pretty good but the employees should work together more and be quicker to refill and check-in, remove plates. Keep improving the menu and service and I'll likely update to 5.

I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped here for the first time with my daughter who has eaten here a few times before and said food was good. Went in and was seated right away and drinks were on the table quickly. My daughter was getting breakfast for dinner and I was going to get a steak. When the waitress came over and told us the special was a fish fry, all you can eat, I decided to get that instead. My daughters meal was great but my fish was like just breading. It was the thinnest fish I have ever seen \"or not seen\". They need to either get thicker fish or put two or three off them together so you can taste the fish. Will not order this again. If I do I will ask to see a piece first before ordering. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Love the food here...it's inexpensive, tastes good and they give you enough to feed a small army.  The chicken fried steak is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Go Black Bear Diner, 
Time is extremely important when it comes to food! They are always extremely busy, but the waiting time is amazing specially when you have a party of six or more. The waiters are attentive and the food is so so yummy they do have big portions just FYI. So go hungry. Drinks, fresh squeezed orange juice super good,coffee is okay no Starbucks but it's good, lemonade is also good. Bathrooms are clean! They have a good parking area."}
{"text":"What a great place for a homestyle meal.  I will definitely be adding the Black Bear Diner to my list of places to eat when visiting Las Vegas.  

I arrived between normal mealtimes and was seated as soon as I arrived, even though the restauraunt was reasonably busy.  The server was awesome.  She was friendly, knew the menu cold, and when I asked her what she liked, wasn't shy in telling me but without being pushy or trying to be persuasive.  I really respected that about her.  (I ordered the \"Gobbler\" sandwich, one of her favorites, on sourdough bread, btw, and it fully lived-up to her recommendation.)  Oh, and the fries were so good that I ate all of them, even though I shouldn't have eaten so many (there was a mountain of hot, delicious fries on my plate, so what's a girl to do?).

The food was reasonably priced (lunch was $14 and change -plus tip- for a sandwich, lots of fries, and a bottomeless soda.  Service was some of the best I've ever had in family-style restaurant.  And there was plenty of parking.

Overall, the Black Bear Diner was a good experience and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Amazing!! The service is great and the food is even better! The serving sizes are large. Everything came out quickly and was fresh. I got the 'Chorizo Chile Verde Hash.' It's similar to huevos ranchero but it's even better. It comes with a cheese quesadilla that is perfect for dipping in your egg yolk (if you like it that way). If you don't like yolk, they'll scramble the eggs for you or cook them how you like. Also comes with some fresh avocado on the side. Lastly, their sweet tea is delicious too. Definitely a restuarant you should check out!!"}
{"text":"Nice decor and the staff is attentive and friendly. The coffee is good and strong which is a huge plus. My friend had a burger which was huge and he enjoyed it. I had the \"famous\" pancakes made with sweet cream. While 2 pancake was enough to fill my plate I could only eat a small portion. They had a great taste it's just they were too big and thick. Even with a lot of butter and syrup I did not really enjoy them as they were dry and heavy. The verdict is still out on Black Bear and I may return, but not a place I would go for pancakes. We will see...."}
{"text":"Breakfast items are ok. However, I have ordered steaks twice and both times were very disappointment. I will suggest you never to order steaks here. Let my mistakes be the only ones."}
{"text":"I really loved this diner! My first time was on a Tuesday afternoon around 1:00 it wasn't too packed but there were a lot of families eating here. I absolutely love how you feel like your in a log cabin. The bear  decor is everywhere and they have hot sauces that range from very spicy to not as spicy by Papa Mama and Baby Bear spice! So cute! The music they were playing was awesome it's a mix of oldies and Goldie's! The menu was on a newspaper and looked so real. I ordered the chicken and waffle meal and my boy ordered the grizzly . Both meals were a 10! The food was really so great here. The pancakes and waffles don't even need syrup because they are so sweet and fluffy. Chicken was light and very crispy, similar to katsu. The service was great and next time I am going to try the coconut cream pie! Can't wait to come back to the Black Bear DIner!"}
{"text":"If i only based the rating on their Fried Chicken, it would be a 0 but I can't.  I usually come here for dessert for their pies but one day asked the waitress about the fried chicken which was sold out for the day.  She got me hook-line-sinker and I was back the next week or two to order my fried chicken.

I wish i could take back that dreaded hour back of my life.   The fried chicken was awful - the breading on the skin fell off and it wasn't seasoned.   So much hype and a total bait and switch job.  

I've been here about 6-7 times in the last couple years for breakfast (which they are more known for) and their pies so I'll give it 3 stars.   Just don't order the fried chicken.  BLAHHHHHHHHHH"}
{"text":"This is some of the best home cooked food I've had in a long time.   I had the tri-tip dip and potato salad and it was fantastic.  Everything looks good coming out of the kitchen.  Curious and fast service. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I was in Ogden Utah, and stopped at a Blackbear dinner. I was surprised that they have on their menu the healthier steel cut oatmeal. Many restaurants don't carry steel cut oatmeal. It's was great.

So, I anticipated ordering this dish at this Blackbear dinner close to my home. I've been at this location twice in the morning on separate occasions and both times been told that the cook hasn't started cooking the steel cut oatmeal yet. Really?
Out of curiosity I spoke to the manager and was told that the cook could start the oatmeal and it would be ready in 20min. So I asked how could you cook steel cut oatmeal in 20min? Then I was told that the cook had started the oatmeal an hour ago and it would be ready in 20min.
However prior to taking to the manager, I was told by a waitress that I could have their 2 day old oatmeal. Needless to say I declined their oatmeal and won't be back to this location. Why have steel cut oat meal on their menu and not have it? Went to Rachael kitchen instead as they always have steel cut oatmeal available."}
{"text":"Service is outstanding!
Food and coffee are okey dokey.
The pancakes are good, sweet and not chewy. They remind me of a flat overcooked cake. I prefer my flap jacks or hotcakes or pancakes to not quickly soak up any syrup I pour over them... and these do. They are a little in the dry side and I end up using more syrup than I should. The eggs are eggs and the red country potatoes are yummy. 

My recent visit left me with burnt red potatoes and I was an angry bear! Until Geoff came along and turned my frown upside down. My waitress must have seen all of the burnt potatoes that I placed around the rim of my bowl; she failed to stop and failed to ask how our meal was going. She was too quick for me to flag her down to alert her to my yucky breakfast. Suddenly Geoff appeared and looked at my food in disbelief. He told me that he would get me a new breakfast. I told him I didn't like to send food back. He looked in my eyes and said it would be okay, he would get me a replacement. He didn't want me to leave hungry. I honestly believed that he cared. I don't think he wanted me to leave hungry. He didn't know I had taken a picture of my burnt potatoes. He had no indication of an intent to SM rant. He just wanted to make me happy and he was so very sincere.

My yummy replacement breakfast was swiftly placed in front of me. 

Thank you Geoff. You are awesome. 

Black Bear Diner, you have a gem in your restaurant and his name is Geoff."}
{"text":"A very good experience every time we go. Breakfast is outstanding, and lunch and dinner aren't bad either. Staff is always very friendly and knowledgeable, tables and areas always clean, and the environment is very welcoming and fun."}
{"text":"I like to think of myself as a connoisseur of pancakes. I've probably tried about every pancake you can think of! And I have to admit, Black Bear's pancakes were pretty freakin' fabulous! Super fluffy with an amazing taste. These are definitely in my top 3. 

While the place kind of reminds you of an IHOP or Dennys, don't be fooled. Go in and try them!"}
{"text":"Came in here about a week after it opened. We were sat quickly around 530 PM on a weekday. Being in our twenties, we noticed that everyone around us was as old as our grandparents. The manager came over to us to get our drink order while our server was taking care of another table. Our server came and we placed our order, meatloaf and fried chicken. My salad came out, and the tomatoes had black spots on them, I just brushed it off. Less than 10 mint yes after we ordered our entrees were out. I ordered fries and my fiancé ordered a baked potato. We both got baked potatoes. I brushed it off, I like baked potatoes. My fried chicken though... It was FROZEN in the middle!!! Not cold, frozen. It was hot on the outside, but totally frozen and pink on the inside. I can't brush that off. The meatloaf was a Swanson dinner quality. We didn't eat any of our food, and asked for the check. When we went up to pay, the manage who got out drinks looked at us weird and said, 'you must of eaten fast!' We were in the restaurant for maybe 25 minutes. He did ask if everything was okay with our food, and I just said it was fine. I was over my experience and just wanted to pay and leave. I should of told him about our experience. I'm sorry for not saying anything."}
{"text":"Took family out for dinner at Black Bear Restaurant.  The best homemade food in the valley. Also it was Tuesday and found out kids eat free that day. With trying to feed a family of five it was great to have three of my kids bill knocked off. Just had to pay for me and my wife....Awesome."}
{"text":"The wait staff was great.  The food was average. Losing our order and waiting for almost an hour for our food wasn't so good. Most concerning was the cleaning that is necessary.  Everything needs to be cleaned.  The dust/grime build up on the air vents appear thick enough to have been there since their opening date.  Not so great having it blow on us and our food."}
{"text":"Out of all the food I love to cook pancakes are not my forte, but anytime I am craving them this is the place for some yummy, big, fluffy pancakes and sweet waffles! 
Try the breakfast Portugues Lenguisa, oh, yeah."}
{"text":"I don't know why it took us so long to try Black  Diner here in Vegas . We been to one in California and had such a good time , can't believe it took us so long to try out this location. 
When we walked in the place was a bit empty. Our servers name was Dawn. She wasn't talkative at all but was nice enough to suggest a few things off the lunch menu since I was feeling a little indecisive. That and I sometimes like to see what server suggest seeing that they know the menu better than I would. She suggested the chicken club , so I ordered that without Swiss . And my wife ordered the turkey club. They both came with fries since I wasn't sure what kind of mayo they used I requested mayo on the side. 
Later reading the menu I noticed the chicken club didn't mention what type of bread it comes on so I flagged a different waitress to see what kind it came on. She replied whichever kind of I wanted , I frowned replying that I wasn't asked so my wife and I told her we both would like them on white. 
When our food arrived everything looked so good, I almost forgot to take photos lol but Don't worry I snapped a few. 
The food was great our server wasn't to attentive we had to flag her down a few times to ask for extra napkins refills etc. her service wasn't so great to say the least. 
The chicken club was great but I loved the turkey club better! If you asked my wife she loved the chicken club more, so we swapped . And if your wondering what type of mayo they use, it's Best Food. Black bear diner gets an A plus for that . 
Oh and by the way I ordered a bear claw to go because I read a review that mentioned they were so good (I had to ask about it because it wasn't on the menu) I wasn't impressed , my mom says it tasted fine & I thought it was dry , I don't know ! 
Four stars for food 
Three stars for service"}
{"text":"Great breakfast options with generous portions very reasonably priced! I just wish they would open one on the north side of town! I'd be a regular!!!"}
{"text":"Comfort Food

I've had the opportunity to dine at several different Black Bear Diners and my opinion has remained consistent. The food is average, nothing really stands out.  What the food lacks in excellence it makes up for in quantity. The serving sizes at black Bear are large, enough for two, or enough to have a meal the next day

I usually go for a breakfast and have found that the entrees arent any better than your typical Village Inn or IHOP.  However, If you have a large appetite, you won't be disappointed by Black Bear.

If you're in the area stop by, the service is good and the staff are friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"I went to my very first-ever Black Bear Diner in Grand Junction, Colorado back in 2008 with my dad. Ever since then, I wished for one to open in my area here in Tempe and one did this year. I've been to this location twice & have also ordered online & picked up food from this one. Great service, very friendly staff, & amazing food each time, plus a wide variety to choose from whether it be breakfast, lunch, or dinner. 

I also recommend my friends to try this place. I always give places I like lots of good word of mouth."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas April 20th weekend and wanted Cracker Barrel since we haven't had it since leaving PA but of course so did every other person. So I looked in yelp and found this spot down the road. Believe me when I say it was spot on! The wait time was minutes not hours. The atmosphere was like being up in a mountain restaurant which was cool. As for the food, holy moly was it rockin. Not to mention the amount they served as well. It was like eating off of a grizzly bears paw is the best way to describe the amount. You won't leave hungry and your tastebuds will be satisfied. I'll be back with the next trip out there."}
{"text":"OooOo! The portions! Wow! I never leave this place hungry. The pancake is larger than my head and there's two (or three) in a stack! I love their pancakes. So fluffy and it taste sooooo good. Mm the buttermilk! 

My husband always get the country fries steak and it's soo much food! The biscuits, the fried steak, eggs, hash, alllll of it are big. I swear that one order is a total of three plates."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place to go eat. Good serving size, great food and great service. I have to say there is nothing this place does bad. I wish more restaurants would work the way this place does. I highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Being that I am a BBD lover already, I was thrilled to be cruising home from LV abs what did I see? A Black Bear mascot waving me over to their latest restaurant in Las Vegas! As usual,  they did not disappoint! 
Just happened to be their inaugural day and in true BBD style everything was amazing! If you have never been...you have got to go! Fabulous foofd, attentive and friendly staff that treat you like longtime friends...and an overall warm atmosphere! Oh, and you have got to try their sausage...to DIE for! Oh my goodness!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, fantastic atmosphere!  I was stoked to see that there was one near or hotel! Totally familiar with the quality of the did from the Mesa, AZ location! This location did not disappoint!  We were seated, on a very busy Saturday morning, within 5 minutes! Food served within 10 minutes of our order being taken! Management was very hospitable and personable! Perfect atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Service is horrible. We got in pretty quickly and sat at our table for about 15mins until we finally decided to ask who are server was and still took another 10 mins for our drinks. Probably will not return to this location even though it's 2 seconds from my house, I'd rather drive the 20 minutes to the other location for the service even though they have a longer wait time. Great customer service equals business."}
{"text":"As I promised in my first review, I went back on a Friday evening for the All You Can Eat Fish Fry.  The fish (cod) was deep fried in a crispy and very tasty batter, served in 3 large pieces, with good cole slaw and crispy french fries, accompanied by a home made tartar sauce.  I think I paid 8.99 and ordered another round of fish, brought me 2 large pieces with additional tartar sauce and some extra slaw and after that I quit, so full of delicious fish!  I plan to do it again soon."}
{"text":"I had to return on a Friday to take advantage of their special, \"all the fried fish you can eat\"!!  I was not disappointed.  Deep fried crispy and very flavorful  crusted cod fish, quite moist and fresh tasting.  Friendly staff, clean environment including the bathroom.  The fish came with coleslaw, great tasting french fries, and splendid tasting hush puppies.  The refill consisted of two large pieces of fish and two hush puppies, and the offer to keep bringing this plate until you say you have had enough.  For $10.99 this was the bomb.  I know where I will be eating many Friday nights."}
{"text":"I alway love their service and food.  We came with a large group and they service was on point and great.  Our order came our correct and the quality was great."}
{"text":"Just got home from dinner at Black Bear Diner Henderson. The food was excellent as it always is at Black Bear and very plentiful!! So happy you guys opened shop here in Green Valley! My family and I missed you .My late dad was a regular fixture at the Black Bear in Salinas,CA and took us there as often as possible. So its both awesome and bittersweet we now have our own so very close to home. The staff is friendly and professional kudos to a great opening day! We will be back and often! Great diner to stop in and have a yummy homey dinner or coffee and a deliciously HUGE bearclaw."}
{"text":"I have had similar experiences as past reviews. After a long wait my party was seated and while we were still being seated the waiter asked us 'what would you like?\" My first thought was I would like to sit down and look at a menu but we ordered 3 waters and one ice tea. It took about 15 minutes to get the water and tea, and we were never given a refill. I ordered the chicken fried steak because some of the reviews were glowing. It was horrible, my tea was horrible. Three of us had potatoes one had hash browns. All four were raw and cold. The pancakes were the only thing on the table worth eating. My advice if you are going to go just order the pancakes."}
{"text":"The best chicken fried steak in town.  I did try there burger n sirloin steak and wasn't pleased with lunch menu. But if you want a dam good breakfast this is the place to go. Don't forget the fresh squeezed O.j.. .."}
{"text":"I waited less than 10 minutes...I ordered 2-egg, 2-bacon & 2-pancake breakfast...I also ordered iced tea & side of green beans w/caramelized onions & bacon crumbles (less than 1/2 cup, pricey at $3.99).  The 2-egg combo was delish so was the green beans.  I originally asked about the side salad which consists of dreaded iceberg lettuce (NO NUTRITIONAL VALUE, cheap quality) priced at $3.99.  I certainly would not order iceberg lettuce because they put it in all their salads mixed with little of other lettuces, TOO DAMN EXPENSIVE for poor-quality lettuce!  Would you spend almost $10 for any kind of salad?  I liked that they had \"a lot less entrees\"...maybe $2-$4 less than the average entree."}
{"text":"I think Black Bear Diner deserves more than the average of a 3 star rating. Based on our first time here for a late breakfast, I give it a solid 4 stars and will plan to come back. 

We arrived at about 10:30 on a holiday. There was plenty of parking and seating. We were greeted warmly and  got a table right away. The host told us the name of our server and she was two steps behind us ready with menus. 

Our server was very helpful in describing their special recipe pancakes and thick bacon. Both sounded yummy. The menu was chock full of options and were informed that we could order anything on the menu. I guess I could have had a burger for breakfast.

Because I'd just eaten a piece of fruit, I wasn't ravenous. I opted for the mini volcano which was an egg on top of a medium and large pancake, 1 piece of bacon and 1 sausage. It was just the right amount of food. I finished all but a couple of bites.  Everything was delicious down to the pancake syrup. The pancakes were especially delicious and our wait for food was relatively short.

We were checked on a couple of times which was perfect timing. My only small criticism was that when my coffee arrived it was warm not hot. This was quickly rectified with a refill which brought it to the right temperature. 

For me, this is a find. Reasonably priced good food is always a good thing."}
{"text":"Good food. Large portions. Good value. Breakfasts are gigantic. Reliable. Good quick service. Try the meatloaf and the chicken fried steaks"}
{"text":"Excellent food at reasonable prices.  Well worth a visit.  Portions are huge and service is quick and friendly. Sandwiches are extra large .  The meatloaf is made the way your mother would make it.  The chicken fried steak is as good as it gets, and you will have trouble finishing the meal."}
{"text":"On Saturday, October 21, 2016 for the first time I had the opportunity to patronize the restaurant Black Bear Diner in Tempe, Az. Upon arrival we were seated almost immediately. The hostess was very friendly, led us to our table. Cassandra was our server, and she was VERY hospitable. Then it was time to order food, so we did. When the food arrived, all I could say was \"MY WORD\". Because the portions were humongous, and of course I couldn't and didn't finished mine. All in all EXCELLENT food and a great variety as well. I also liked how we were checked on quite frequently from time to time by Cassandra and by the manager. I will be back and most definitely recommend you to others. Keep up the good work!!!!!    Kevin"}
{"text":"yummy cheap diner food can't go wrong if you want something cheap to eat and it's real cozy and cute . the meals are pretty big there pies are okay too. def worth a try"}
{"text":"While in town on vacation we ate her a couple of times and really enjoyed this restaurant. Our meals, even on Christmas evening, were served quickly, as requested and piping hot.

One thing I would point out to the management of this location: When a cashier / host is busy helping other customers and people are waiting to be seated, they should at least make eye contact with the waiting people and acknowledge them. A simple \"I'll be right with you\" would go a long way toward making people waiting feel like they aren't being ignored.

Our servers were on the ball and the cooks prepared our food just as we asked. Next time we're in Tempe, we'll be back for another visit."}
{"text":"Corned Beef hash---Yum!!
Belgian Waffles----Yum, Yum.
Chicken Fried Steak with side of mixed berries, Redskin potatoes and Biscuit.--Maximum Yums!    

The OJ is fresh squeezed and the waitresses are flawless.  This is one franchise joint that has its act together.  I now have another breakfast place to rotate between Blueberry Hill and the Omelette House."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Courtyard across the corner and was told to visit Black Bear for breakfast. I have to say I am glad I did. This has to be the friendliest place in Vegas. I think everyone their asked me if I needed anything as I was waiting for our food (Togo order). The tall gentleman who took my order asked my name and used it everyone I talked to him. It is in Henderson, but I would drive out there during our next visit. Thanks Black Bear, JAY"}
{"text":"The service was excellent, but my side salad had a dead gnat on the plate under the lettuce. It made me not want to eat the sandwich I ordered. Luckily, the sandwich did not contain bugs and was delicious."}
{"text":"I had the corned need hash. Very good! One comment though is do not get the breakfast potatoes... Get the hash browns.
My wife had the Cinnamon Roll French Toast. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"Everything was hot fresh and delicious. Service was friendly and prompt. Came for dinner. Had the fried chicken. I thought all the sides were delicious. It came with green beans which I'm not a big fan of but even they were delicious."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about BBD!  The food is always fresh and delicious!  They use high quality ingredients and the coffee is always fresh.  On top of that I have always relieved excellent service!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast I have ever had was here at the cozy Black Bear DIner.  Big fan of all the special sauces that are at every table. Generous portions that will  stuff your belly and make you  get a to go box. Ham steak is the bomb as well as omelets. Service was on target as well even on a busy Saturday. Staff is friendly and Don the manager was right on target when he said it would be less than 10 minutes for a table seating. Every time we come to Vegas we are sure to make a stop here. Fresh squeezed OJ is also great. If you want a good ole country breakfast with  all the fixins then this is the place for you! Thanks Don for a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time at the Black Bear Diner.  WOW!  

First the place is adorable and spotless.  Bear pictures and decorations everywhere.

The menu is on a \"newspaper\" so again adorable.  

BE HUNGRY is all I can warn you.  The portions are HUGE.  I've had both breakfast and lunch and had take out both times. 

This restaurant makes their own biscuits, country gravy and roasts their own turkey every day. The biscuit is about 4 in by 3 in and about 3 inches deep.  Big, flaky and very yummy.

My thanks to Brandon, our waiter today for taking such good care of us.  I have a picky 83 year old mother in a wheelchair who though small, eats like a truck driver.  She was move than surprised and satisfied .  

I asked what specials the restaurant has: Black Bear Diner has an all you can eat Friday Fish Fry.  I had the Fish and Chips today for lunch.  Amazing lightly battered fish, 3 good size pieces, your choice of french fries or mashed potatoes and cole slaw ( pretty sure it was made there).

Very Family friendly.  Unknown if they take reservations.  One of these days I am returning for the individual pies which looked wonderful."}
{"text":"I really can't say I enjoyed our late afternoon breakfasts.  Reminds me of no place other than Bugaboo Creek steak house back home in RI. Back wood kinda feel.  Very kiddish, playland feel to me. Food smelled great, server was friendly. 

The coffee here in my opinion sucks. It was jet fuel, like someone burnt the pot and tried adding water bitter as heck.  That's a big no no with me.

Food came out I was disappointed I got less portions then any one else at the table. Lol oh well, I struggled through my breakfast washing it down with coffee. 

If you like this place great there's a sign up for their club. I'm not signing up."}
{"text":"My hubby & I went back and had a great time.  Service was great, food was so good and everything was so appetizing.   Go there hungry because you get a lot of food for your momey."}
{"text":"I had the chicken avocado club which was really good and 2 cups of tomato soup. I'm glad we got there when we did because it was quite slow when we first arrived but as soon as we got our food...The dinner rush was flowing in. This is my second time eating at Black bear diner. My first time was in tracy, Cali. They have a wide variety of different food which is good when you have a family that all have different taste buds."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Black Bear Diner for a late breakfast. They definitely give you a lot of food and I could hardly finish my meal. I had the French Toast, eggs, and sausage. The sausage was delicious! I would recommend this place to a friend and when I come back to Vegas I will drop by a location."}
{"text":"Its a diner, if you set your expectations towards a diner or Cracker barrel, you'll  be happy.
My companions had waffle w/ bacon, Eggs Benedict, and a 'southern Scramble\" i had a patty melt.
When ordering my patty melt, I requested Rare as they could... so of course it was well done to the point of tree bark!
However, the brides Soutthern scramble was insane, so much... everything!  Biscuits, sausage, eggs... 
frankly, I would try the omelette version next if I were here.
Eggs Bennidict... a winner according to the frieind.
And the waffle? Looked like a great waffle, but nothing earth shattering
\
Asv for mtn meal
Sadly, When asked how I wanted it cooked, I asked as medium rare as possible, and bieng e, i asked for well done, hot fries.
well my patty was as well done as zanything I've ever had, zero juice, zero flavor, jusym  VEY well done patty  meat.

And the cheese on the melt? it was sourly lacking... so little cheese, it was worthless. and onions? What onions? I admit, I was very sad by my personal meal.
Final insult, the fries that I asked for well done, might have been tasty, 30 minutes before we arrived! They were as cold and flaccid a fry as I've had in forever... made me  wish for any drive through.

Final verdict, I'll go back... the portions are HUGEMONGOUS! and some things seem awesome... so I'll try breakfast,  which seems to be the the winning meal here.
Sadly, I've had a better patty melt at Whataburgur.. and I muist restate the sad part of that statement.
(The brides scramble seemed a bit much, will post images) so I think next time I'll try a omlette instead)


My advise to my6 friends?
Go there! be Hungry
But as with most places, nothing is perfect."}
{"text":"Just left here...what a disappointment. Food took over an hour to get our table...when it showed up we got one meal at a time and our last meal (a burrito) took another 10 mins. The waitress did try to make it up with a free pie and I almost appreciated it but then she and other waitresses started fighting around us. Father's day lunch with cursing waitresses was not something we enjoy. Save your time and go to Dennys."}
{"text":"Great home cooking food. Simple people, simple comfort food that is really tasty! Staff was friendly and service was great. Everyone in the party said their food was great. Waitress was very attentive and refilling the coffee often (which we love!) will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I love the coffee here. It doesn't beat sambalatte at all, but when I want breakfast with decent coffee, this is my go to spot.

Big portioned meals.

I don't think any of the entree items here are particularly amazing but it's all average or above average. Everything from the chicken fried steak, to the omelettes, and the benedicts."}
{"text":"Food is great but service this time stunk staff doe not help each other and they can't get order right. The server stand around and talk to customers while slapping other servers I like this place but the service could be a lot better"}
{"text":"Love Black Bear diner! Big portions of rib sticking food. 

This particular location has some service issues with their older servers. Forgetful of many things like coffee, coffee creamers, extra water, sides etc, on more than a few visits day/night. 
Some have  a bit of that Midwest \"Flo\" diner waitress (for way too long) attitude. 

Food-wise, the hash browns have been undercooked on more than one occasion and the gravy tends to be a bit cold. 

Music is a little loud for the space as well. 

I'll still be a regular however!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They're breakfasts are great! They make the best buttermilk biscuits I've ever had. I had their california omlet, it was fantastic and huge. Prices are resonable too. I've always had great food here, burgers, sandwiches, taco salads..........only thing I didn't like was their chili. It's extremely spicy. I love the decor in there too, makes you feel like you're on vacation in the mountains."}
{"text":"I love this location and the other one on 66th and Bell. This one tends to have friendly service and more attentive wait staff. Food is always great, portions always big, can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"We ate at Black Bear Diner in Las Vegas on May 29, 2018.  Our waitress was outstanding.  The food was pretty damn good!!  The pancake which can be added to any breakfast entree was excellent!!  
It gets crowded so be prepared to wait for a table.  
All and all - I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I have been to one in california,  Colorado Springs,  now here in Vegas. I ordered the NY steak and eggs and let me tell you they cook my steak perfect. Unfortunately today there was a mix up but nothing that was major. Flower was a great server. She was very attentive. I don't remember the other gals name that served us last time but she was awesome as well.  The gentleman that sat us today was very friendly and and funny.  So far I have not had bad service there and hope to never have it either. Joined their club and got a free bear claw that thing is huge and oh so yummy."}
{"text":"We went to Black Bear Diner and put in our name and waited 35min. and other people got seated before us. I asked and was told they sit the bigger tables first. So they seated the parties of four people vs a party of three."}
{"text":"OK. I LOVE Black Bear Diner. They have unique newspaper menus that shares a piece of history in the community, which is such a great touch. Very homey environment and some of the friendliest employees. Now let's talk food. You guys, they have HUGE inexpensive portions of delicious food. Plus, they have some of the best bacon in my opinion. Their pancakes are so good, you don't need any syrup to eat them. They are already so flavorful! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nothin like this in the East Valley. Parking lot packed, never heard of this place. It's good, really good. Healthy, not so much. Differences from most bfast places include, they make their own sausage and hash browns. Both were great. Scrambled eggs were normal good. Service great, and the coffee was good. The guy next to me had eight cups, and he's still in there."}
{"text":"I  had not idea this small chain of 68 restaurants even existed until last week when we stopped in for breakfast with the family en route to San Diego.  I can't rave enough.  Great rustic country atmosphere with a wonderfully delightful and varied menu all at a reasonable price with large portions.  Probably one of the better breakfasts I've had in a long time.  Everyone in our fam loved it and we can't wait to return again soon.  Excellent and attentive service.  Delicious food.  Comfy atmosphere,  Generous portions and reasonable prices.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, nothing to go \"crazy\" over but it's a very decent breakfast out and the atmosphere is cute with the bear theme going. Next time I will be having the individual coconut cream pie and fresh OJ that I have been eye balling on my last two visits ;)"}
{"text":"MY most favorite breakfast place EVER!
Ham eggs and hash browns with the biscuit is so freaking good!! 
'I wish I lived near a Black Bear Diner I would be a regular."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely the worst, went there this morning my wife had a Denver omelette and I had Joe's omelette. Biscuits and gravy and potatoes were cold. Plus it was really expensive! Late in afternoon now - and my wife has diarrhea and upset stomach."}
{"text":"We really like Black Bear Diner, Im with another guy's review i read...\"You won't regret it, unless you over indulge with their HUGE portions\". This is so true. 

I love that they have flavored non-dairy creamer for my coffee. I generally get breakfast or lunch, yet to try dinner, only because there is less for me to choose from dinner part of the menu. I have to chose wisely since i am Gluten Intolerant.  The 4 stars is for not having gluten free bread.

There is always a huge line of people coming and going in the waiting area. If you are lucky, you can sit next to the big stuffed bear while waiting for your table, Ha!
Our servers are always great and we have no complaints. We will come back and you should give this a try, many locations, even out of state and we have tried those too."}
{"text":"Excellent experiece. Look forward to eating breakfast hear every year. Cindy is the BOMB and always takes great care of us!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast- good choices and reasonable prices.  Basic old time comfort food.  Huge portions."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite restaurant for sure . The food is amazing, portions are large, prices are affordable, and service is really good. Brittany took really good care of us. She is energetic, friendly, and super attentive. The atmosphere is  very cozy and other patrons were very friendly too."}
{"text":"First time here. The menu items are great and the staff friendly. It's a small diner feel very humble and friendly. They say they have big portions here. Bring your appetite"}
{"text":"As a big fan of Cracker Barrel I had high hopes for this place.  I just love county style breakfast.  I was not disappointed.  The service was down home style with the very friendly inviting staff.  Our waitress although busy did a fantastic job taking care of us.  The newspaper style menu was different since we didn't realize that what it was till we asked for a menu.  
   The food was everything I had hoped for.  I got the Grizz which was prefect.  I got my eggs scrambled and then added the chipotle hot sauce which was very good.  The ham was sweet which a slight smoky taste and was quickly devoured.   The bacon was crisp and the sausage was very good also.  The pancakes were perfect.  They were sweet and fluffy.  The hash browns were very good and done home style.  I couldn't eat everything and had to load up a to go box since it was so good.  I would come here again and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I was invited to the soft opening and also this was my first time going to  Black Bear Diner. I ordered the chicken and waffles and my friend ordered the ribs with veggies. The food was amazing! The portions were a pretty good sized. Everything tasted so good. You also have to try the corn muffin it was so good and fresh.  The service was on point. I can't wait to come back again.  

Try the chicken and waffles!"}
{"text":"HUGE portions, yummy food and great service too. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had to come back to the diner to try their Summer Shrimp Specials. Of the three choices--Shrimp Benedict, Shrimp Chef Salad, and Shrimp BLT Sandwich--I chose the sandwich. It was amazing. The buttery, lightly toasted sourdough bread was stuffed with a savory shrimp salad and, of course, bacon, lettuce, and tomato. There was so much shrimp, it fell from the sandwich with every bite, still leaving plenty inside the bread. It was one of the most flavorful sandwiches I've ever had. On the side, was a cup of fresh cole slaw that was not too sweet and not too tart, but just right. I highly recommend this sandwich, but the Shrimp Specials will only be offered during the summer. So I may rush back to try the other shrimp plates!"}
{"text":"Great service,  food was very tasty.  Sourdough parm burger was great! Desserts out of this world.   Will be back.  Thanks Lynne!"}
{"text":"Very slow service. They got my order wrong and took my food away for 10 minutes while the rest of my table ate. They returned my plate sans the incorrect item yet never brought out the corrected item or deducted from our bill. Egg Works is way better food and service."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!!  Had the Huevos Rancheros for breakfast.  Huge portions and low prices.  Great service and very clean.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love this place, good portion sizes and decent prices. I highly recommend the sweet cream pancakes.. I really like them. For some reason I always want to go camping after I visit this place. I have only been here for breakfast so I'm not sure about anything else. The costumer service has always been delightful. This has a Denny's, Blueberry Hill kinda feel but different food and cleaner... a lot cleaner"}
{"text":"I LOVE some black bear diner. I have never had a bad experience there and I love their food.

I love the environment and the theme, bears bears and more bears. Also, the kind of woodsy feel ties it all together perfectly. Their menu is rather interesting, it's a print of an old newspaper. On the inside is the actual menu. I have my personal favorites including the grizz breakfast and bobs big bear burger deluxe. I also really enjoy their side salad served with mm bacon ranch. I have had a number of other things from their menu that were sensational. The price isn't bad for anything either, especially for the amount of food they give you. By far my favorite menu item is their pancakes. I usually don't care for pancakes and almost never eat them when they are on the side from another breakfast place. Butttt black bears pancakes are unbelievable! They are soft, but thick. They are sweet but still really good with syrup. Mmmmm my mouth is watering thinking about them.

If you're looking for a place to take the kids, or really anyone, I would strongly suggest black bear."}
{"text":"I came early to have coffee and wait for my car to be repaired. Amberle was my waitress. She was awesome. Thank you for allowing me to sit at the booth for several hours! Thank you for your kindness!
I have been in this place before for networking events. 
I got to hear music from when my grandparents were alive...Don't laugh I knew the words. 
The coffee was better then starbucks and i got refills.

I like this place it even has a Black Bear on the post."}
{"text":"I really like this place & it's servers. Breakfast & lunch are the meals i've had there & think this will be the place for us. Pick up a pie too."}
{"text":"We go here all of the time. Seriously the best breakfast food I have ever had. Makes The Place look like Denny's. Fish Fry on Fridays is actually really good too. I've never had a bad meal here but WOW the breakfast is amazing. 

PS: While I LOVE Black Bear- Their coffee SUCKS, its really bad.... Stop and grab a cup to bring with you."}
{"text":"It was a cute set place. Their dishes were huge and hard to finish for people who don't eat as much. The food was delicious though and good to take home."}
{"text":"Delicious, comfort food. 

Had a burger and fries basket...basic but good. 

The decor reminds me of the Farmer Boys chain. Friendly staff even though we arrived 30 minutes till closing. Would like to go back and try other items on the menu. I've long heard great things about their breakfast."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this joint.  Pretty simple theme, excellent menu, ample portions and most important, consistent quality.  

I usually come for breakfast and I come hangry!  The friendly staff takes the edge off and then they lay down a platter of food that makes you wonder if your eyes may be too big for your belly (not me, I'm a fat kid at heart).  

I do wish they served alcohol but I guess no one is perfect.  Highly recommend that you grab a dessert to go.  Made fresh in house, they are simply amazing.  We got the chocolate cream pie last time... wow.  Couldn't decide if I wanted to eat it or make sweet love to it."}
{"text":"All you Vegas travelers, save your $ on what really counts an amazing hotel room with a stunning view. 
I know Vegas has become fu fu when it comes to dinning experiences and I can share with you plenty of $$$$ restaurants, but paying $6.50 for a slice of pizza just because your on the strip is ridiculous! 
So do yourself a favor find a place off the strip. And this was one of them that was not only reasonable price, but service was outstanding!!! Sunday brunch can be busy, we were told 15 minutes, but it was more like 10. Immediately we were asked our drinks and than our waitress Flower stopped by to take our order. Classic eggs Benedict with hash browns were $9.95/ on the strip, I'm sure it was going to be $15-20. The lunch menu looked just as good and really considered coming back, that's how good it was. If you come to Vegas to dine at high end, celebrity chefs.. This ain't your place, but if you want a great diner, home cook meal, you'll be pleased!"}
{"text":"I frequent the bell and dysart locations and  this was the first time it was \"eh\". The Bigfoot chicken fried steak and eggs are always large and more than enough. The gravy this time seemed watery and the toast was half burnt and half bread. The other meal of a bacon and cheese stuffed burger looked awesome but we had to return because it was requested with no onion. The replacement was nothing more than a regular burger with bacon and cheese. The bear claws which are usually nice and hot was cold and was missing its butter, and some bites felt like I was chewing dough. It was busy on a Friday night and the place seemed understaffed. After wards when most of the dinner rush was over our waitress barely made any rounds to check up on us and did not get one single refill for our soda and tea. They were nice to remove my date's burger from the bill. Because of our frequent dine ins and our bear rewards card the bill came to 40 cents. If you go to this place and want good service you will have to wait that weekend morning for about 45 minutes when the star employees are working."}
{"text":"Good food at a great value.  I've been here a couple of times with family and they've done a good job with service, portions, and taste.  You're probably going to make the mistake of ordering too much food so be careful; if one of you orders the The Grizz (2 sweet cream pancakes, 3 eggs*, 2 slices of hickory smoked bacon, 2 sausage links & a hickory smoked ham steak) I'd suggest you share part of that meal with someone who orders something smaller.  I've only been here for breakfast and haven't seen any of their other dishes; if you decide to give it a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a number of times...figured it was time to give them some love on yelp.

I'd have to say I'm a fan to this chain.  I've not been to any other location but the one in GV is nice.  It can get busy during the normal busy times (early breakfast, noon, Sunday brunch time) but they've always handled the crowds well and are pretty on it with wait times.  Time from ordering to food in front of me was 15-20 min which I think is not bad considering the place looked to be full to capacity.  Every time I've been, the server was attentive and kept our beverages topped off while we waited.   

Their food has always been more than satisfactory.  It's diner food....so when you take it for what it is you will not be disappointed. Pancakes, eggs, chicken fried steak, hash, burgers....I've had them all they've always been prepared well.  All portions are very large so there is value when considering cost which I feel isn't bad.

The good: Large portions, relatively cheap, clean facilities, suprisingly the huevos rancheros

The great: fresh squeezed orange juice, cinnamon roll french toast (phenomenal), 

The bad: Steak and eggs were my least fav of meals there...steak a bit over done.  It's steak from a diner....It's not a steakhouse so I don't expect Prime meats seared to perfection.  Tasted fine...overall big picture I won't count that against them too much."}
{"text":"Our family eats at Black Bear at least once a week and have been for quite some time. We come when we are hungry. Verrrry hungry! The portions are ginormous and the food is high quality. When we travel the west coast, we always look for BBDs because we really love this place! 

We really enjoy the entire menu - but mostly stop in for breakfast or dinner. Be sure to come on Fridays for the all-you-can-eat fish fry. Endless supply of fish and hush puppies but only one serving of fries and Cole slaw. Or if you want a salad, you can't go wrong with the taco salad with ranch bacon dressing. That dressing by the way, is made at the restaurant and there are big chunks of bacon in it!

If you're in the mood for breakfast, I highly recommend the chicken fried steak, or try some of their perfectly grilled waffles. 

The atmosphere is laid back, with walls and pillars adorned with pictures and statues of black bears. They even have a room with a closing door if you needed a space for a meeting or large party. You can purchase shirts and other trinkets to take home with you or better yet, take a delicious dessert with you. The pies and bear claws are amazing! 

The staff are always great and service is attentive! The prices are super reasonable for the amount of food you get. Before you leave, be sure to enter your phone number on their customer loyalty program to score $10 off every $100 you spend."}
{"text":"I have this recurring dream where I'm lying in bed, and my friend Tyrone calls. And he's all \"I can dig more clams than you!\" And I'm like \"No wai!\" And then I spend the rest of the dream looking for a place to park. I don't know where that dream came from. I don't even know anyone named Tyrone.

But if I did this is where I would take him. Because Black Bear Diner is as surreal as road trip dining gets. 

The ironic pictures featuring little bears trying to do what humans do (\"haha! Silly bear! Manual transmissions are for humans! One day you will become somebody's rug! Ha ha!). The suspenders. Reading your menu from an old Goodyear Gazette. The faint presence of Wilford Brimley in the air. Wilford Brimley is everywhere, and can take many forms.*

But alas, Tyrone is not real, and so therefore did not make a suitable dining companion. But Misty S is very much real (and very much my squeeze), so I brought her here instead.

Our initial disappointment at the absence of African-American leather daddies aside, we quite enjoyed ourselves.

She ordered the pot roast, and me the chicken fried steak. Both came with a side of mashed potatoes (you get your choice of two from a list of six or so) that came topped with gravy that matched the entree. This was done without prompting. I was so excited to see my meat and potatoes so perfectly accessorized that I nearly shat glitter.

BBD's claim to fame is giving you a lot of food. It says so like twenty times on their menu. And in reality it is a lot. So much that you can hear the strained whines and cries of other patrons trying to finish their garlic bread. Or was it Texas Toast? I don't think it counts as Texas Toast if it's only grilled on one side. 

Why do I keep capitalizing Texas Toast? 

And why is everyone staring at me? Is it because I'm not dry heaving my way through my entree?

Oh shit, is there glitter on my seat?

*My review of Trader Joe's. Oh snap, self-reference!"}
{"text":"We tried to experience their breakfast the day after moving to Las Vegas which was this past Sunday- and the world was already there in line. A 40 minute wait was not possible...

We came back for dinner yesterday and enjoyed some good old school customer service. The hostess and Marlene were great!

My husband could not resist ordering a meal of ribs with shrimp, kielbasa, salad and mixed zucchini. I had a nice tuna melt and cole slaw. We shared an apple crumble a la mode.

While having dessert we overheard Marlene greet an 80-ish year old gentleman. By the time he made it to the table she had water waiting for him and was greeting him as he seems to be a regular.  Everyone was helpful and friendly. 

Food was ok- the treasure here for us was customer service."}
{"text":"The Customer Service was Great The Portions of food Above Average!!! Unique Pancakes... My husband had the Pineapple Upside Down Pancakes n Loved Them!!! I had the All meat Omelet... We will Definitely be Back!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, I must be invisible today. I walk in,  wait to be seated behind two folks. Two people came behind me with a chilld. They seat  the two folks in front of me, then they seat two folks that came in after me with the child ... and leave me standing there.  Never again."}
{"text":"Before I start, we live in California and frequent the location in Torrance about twice a month so we know a great deal about their menu and service, etc. (Amazing!!) 
The consistency is exactly the same! The food is absolutely great-huge portions still and the food is hot! 
Despite the fact that there was a huge group of people waiting, the wait was probably less than 10 minutes! 
Also, I must say that Don (the manager) is absolutely amazing!!!! I saw him interacting with the guests waiting and people eating. He seemed to be helping his team a lot. In addition to him making a difference for his team, he made personal connections with the guests. For example, he told my son that he had a surprise coming then brought him a balloon and sticker (my son was stoked!) he went on to trick my son into thinking that he thought my son was Spiderman. He returned a couple more times to talk to spiderman and my son was absolutely happy! You always win over the parents when you're good with their kids! Next time we're in Vegas, we're stopping by again! Thanks Don!"}
{"text":"There is no other reason I go to Black Bear Diner than the chicken fried steak.  Each time we are near this diner, but thankfully not too often, this is the one and only thing that pops off the page.  It is so good.  The larger serving is enough for two, easily.  Pounded, hand breaded with a cracker crust, then fried to a wonderful crispy crunch.  And a great cream gravy. The fixins are great too.  Biscuits are light and short.  Service is always good, the atmosphere is pleasant.

It is nice to know that there are a string of BBDs up the Central Valley of California.  We frequent that route and always need a meal stop.  This is always a great breakfast while on  \"vacation\" for us."}
{"text":"Absolutely best breakfast place in the area! Loooove the pancakes. I highly recommend them to anyone. It's not cheap but you will leave satisfied! Just know that breakfast time is the busiest and there is typically a 15-30 minute wait. Proof that it is delicious! Very friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"A friend told me about that place and I was not disappointed. Service is awesome, which makes all of the difference! Their food is delicious and the different hot sauces compliment it. Portions are huge, so if you're looking to save some money, sharing is a great option."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent serviceThis place is right out of Idaho, Oregon, upper Maine ,Oklahoma ,Salt Lake City. Good hot food, very busy, very polite waitresses, good prices. Only lilly-white customers from the adjoining trailer & mobile-home parks on Trop.   just saying. The place to be if you dont want to be around any people of color at all...."}
{"text":"I am seriously straight up addicted to their orange juice.  It's freshed squeezed and seriously SO good.  I usually squeeze my own oj at home but it's a process, so if I'm no too patient it's perfect to stop by:) and the staff is always very nice.  One girl especially, I believe her name was Ellie.  There's one other young guy who was AWESOME as we'll but I totally don't remember his name:/"}
{"text":"Get your name on the list, but don't let the lines scare you away. They seat pretty fast (15-20 minutes), and they tend to over estimate the wait time. Just try to avoid popular post-church service times, or you will wait!

The is consistently good and so is the coffee. The service can be inconsistent at times, but is generally really good too. It's a clean restaurant and a fun place to go. They're great with children and their kids' plates tend to be a lot - but better than too little!

It's worth the trip from almost anywhere (except maybe the far northeast or east near Nellis). 

In terms of seating, just be aware that if you get sat in the side room (off to the right when looking in the restaurant), the last booth on the left (walking toward the kitchen) is not bad, but the A/C blows right on you.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best all day Breakfest in Las Vegas. Every trip out here includes multiple stops here!"}
{"text":"I really liked my breakfast. The bacon, delicious! Pancakes, awesome. The place has a nice homey feel to it. The menus are like little newspapers, very cute. My waitress was nice. The coffee, good. Music not too loud in the background. The place was busy, but I didn't have to wait for a table. I highly recommend the restaurant."}
{"text":"This little restaurant on the corner reminds me a lot of the breakfast joints littered throughout the area around Pigeon Forge Tennessee. Decent Diner grub with very friendly and prompt service. I am a sucker for a plethora of dipping sauces, and on the table they had several different pepper sauces. My favorite was the baby burn sauce. The flavor balance of it was perfect on the hash browns and over over-easy eggs on my country fried steak platter. The country fried steak was a little on the small side but had a good flavor to it. On the downside I got the biscuit originally which is a thick biscuit that is more reminiscent to a cake then something you will find in a diner in Mississippi or Louisiana that is referred to as a biscuit. Luckily the waitress or move the biscuit and gave me a couple slices of toast which hit the spot. The service here really is impressive because I left my credit card here by accident and they had it for me at lunch when I came back and I noticed there was no erroneous charges added to it :-)"}
{"text":"Just moved into the neighborhood and they have the GREATEST pancakes in Vegas! (And I grew up here) this place had a really cool homey feeling and the staff is always nice! They serve breakfast all day and u can mix and match dinner and breakfast sides/ entrees. I love it here!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a regular for us on the weekends. The help is almost always friendly and timeliness of the delivery of the food is prompt. In particular we enjoy one of our favorite waitress Mindy. She always greets us with a smile and hug and takes the time to make us feel comfortable. But generally all the wait help does. The food is good and plated well! Breakfast is our favorite. I would definitely recommend the place to others."}
{"text":"Average american fan fare.  The food is usually good, but can be inconsistent.  Health code violations in the past were really bad.  Fortunately it does look better now and the place seems to be turning around with new staff and management.  In dire need of some modern services for business customers.  WiFi would be nice, is it too much to ask for a restaurant to spend $150 on a router to set up a secure private network and a guest network for guests?  I don't think so!

So, food good, business meetings, not so much."}
{"text":"Second time eating here.  The first time was outstanding, the service and the food, but this time...not so much.  Both were seriously lacking.  

They apparently didn't know who was covering what area and if I hadn't eaten all day I would've walked out.  We must have waited almost 15 minutes to order food after sitting down.  I brought the family based off my last experience but they didn't seem pleased at all.  

Wife had the country potatoes that had far more bell peppers and onions than actual potatoes.  My kid's grilled chicken breast had a pink center.   My food was okay, but I didn't enjoy it all that much due to being pissed off.  

Either way, I initially went there because I work nearby and some coworkers raved about the place.  I may give it another shot, I may not.

Edited: Thank goodness I have 4 bathrooms!  My wife, my two kids, as well as myself, felt horrible a short time after returning home.  Kid missed Tae Kwon Do practice later due to a stomach ache!  Dropping my rating down from 3 to 2 stars only because of my first experience.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"While vacaying in Vegas went to visit a friend in Henderson who frequents this location, especially for breakfast. As soon as you walk in, they make you feel like a welcome, frequent patron. Menu is inside a cute Black Bear Newspaper. So many options for lunch and breakfast, took us awhile to decide. Until I saw The Gobbler sandwich. It's basically a Thanksgiving sandwich with avocado and tomato. The kicker is the marble rye bread (as recommended by our server). We got sweet potato fries as a side and she recommended ranch dressing as a dip. The entire meal was the bomb!

I brought the menu home and looked for a location near me. Bummer, 50 miles away."}
{"text":"Don't go here very often but I enjoy it and really liked our server Alex. He was great and made some grate suggestions for next time."}
{"text":"I came in on father's day and while I expect them to be busy, I also expect them to give me a realistic wait time on check in. Today I came in and was told it was a 35 minute wait, we ended up waiting 75 minutes before getting a table. No explanation, no acknowledgement. We are now seated and have been waitring 15 minutes for our food. Not a great experience.

Still waiting for my food 100 minutes later..."}
{"text":"The food is good all American fare. I got a tasty chunk of chicken with salad and fries. That chicken was perfectly fried. The meatloaf was good too. Really tasty gravy. The waffle was tasty too. I love that there is decoration of bears literally everywhere, it's fun and cute. The menu is an old school newspaper and has lots of options. They even have a national park burger that donates to the national parks, if you're fan of Americana this is a place to check out. Only 4/5 because slowish service, had to go grab my own ketchup off a table."}
{"text":"This morning was my first time to Black Bear Diner. I had the 2 egg combo, with chicken fried steak, country potatoes and biscuit. The was so much food, that I couldn't eat it all. The chicken fried steak was tender with a crisp crust, the egg were scrambled to perfection, the country potatoes had the right ratio of potato to pepper & onion, and the biscuit was big and flaky. I will return."}
{"text":"After a wild weekend in Vegas of staying in one of the fancy hotels on the strip, my girlfriend and I wanted to grab a GOOD and reasonably PRICED meal before we got on the road to home. So of course we drove off the strip to achieve these two goals in a meal in Las Vegas.  A woman working at the gas station directed us to this place which made it clear that this was a \"locals\" spot.  

The Rundown
-About 7min drive from the strip
-Clean and quaint 
-Kind of a long wait on weekends (15-20 min)
-Food is pretty good, standard diner food.  (Turkey Burger was AMAZING)
-The staff was VERY friendly and attentive 
-Our waitress even told us the truth about certain items on the menu that she would suggest we NOT order lol good on her 
-Coffee was amazing
- BILL was super CHEAP 

Will def make this a tradition for a hang over meal after a crazy weekend in Vegas"}
{"text":"Love this place, always food for the money and the sweet cream pancakes are amazing, staff is great and manager is always nice to my daughter"}
{"text":"I like coming here for breakfast. The bacon is nice and crisp and very flavorful. You have a choice of hash browns or country red potatoes. The red potatoes are really good with onions and peppers and they don't taste like they come from a bag. The portions are very big so go hungry. The service is very good here especially Trina. Trina is always very nice and efficient. Expect to wait for a table during weekends. Four stars instead of five because the lemon cream pie had little flavor and hardly any pie crust."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went here for the first some and walked out with out even sitting down after being completely ignored by the hostess. She answered the phone as we walked in and proceeded to take a Togo order for the next 5 minutes. Mind you, I work in the hospitality industry- I can understand a busy night. So we waited. Well when she got off the phone- she picked it up again and started a whole new order. With out even saying hello or acknowledging us at all! I felt it was beyond poor customer service."}
{"text":"Fantastic bacon cheddar burger! Very polite and responsive staff. I'll definitely be back again and again!"}
{"text":"PORTION ALERT!

A while back, I came here with some friends while waiting for our turn at Fast Lap.  Woah, what a bad idea.  The food and restaurant was excellent!  The portions are a little crazy!

The funny part is that I ordered the \"A little less dinner\" portion and it was way too much still.  I got the Tri-Tip dinner with mashed potatoes, gravy, green beens, salad and a corn bread muffin!

Best \"diner\"  I've ever had.  Completely makes IHOP and Denny's look like McDonalds.  

Only issues is the speed which the food came out and then the amount of time it took to pay the bill.  Other than that, it's a great place.  A little busy around the usual meal times - but worth it if you go a little early."}
{"text":"Simply amazing food! Huge portions and great prices. The staff is really friendly and the place is clean, well lit and in a good location. This is a great place for brunch with friends or loved ones. 
One word of advice is to bring a hearty appetite. 
I had the cheeseburger salad and it was huge.

What a great value."}
{"text":"I had the pot roast,  he had the Southern Fried Steak,  and my daughter had a Reuben.   HUGE portions,  excellent,  EXCELLENT service from Charlie.   We'll be Back!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place! We only had breakfast but you can order anything on menu. They have fresh orange juice & food portions are big. Loved the theme, atmosphere & friendly staff. 
My only regret was not trying their bread pudding, too full after my meal."}
{"text":"Spendy for breakfast but still good food.  Music pretty loud for the breakfast crowd. Too loud in fact.  Probably won't go back because of it"}
{"text":"This place would get 5 stars for me if it didn't sell T Shirts.  They're trying a little too hard to brand what, at it's core, is really good diner breakfast food with great portions, and to me, that speaks for itself. 

I came in and sat at the counter.  The staff was really friendly and I didn't wait at all to be seated.  I ordered something that apparently consisted of most of the menu.  Eggs, hash browns, bacon, ham, sausage, pancakes and a slice of watermelon (and I feel like I'm still forgetting something).  It was all really good and the portion was enormous.  I'll definitely be back when I'm craving a huge and satisfying breakfast and have time for a nap in the afternoon!"}
{"text":"I've been here once with a friend for lunch didn't know exactly what to get so I went with a burger. It was lacking a lot of salt and flavor."}
{"text":"By far the best food I've ever had. The staff are very friendly and the atmosphere feels warm and welcoming. I had the steak breakfast... Very delicious and inexpensive"}
{"text":"I haven't been back to this Black Bear in over a year due to bad food. Was there tonight,and it is worse than ever. Had the Tri-Tip Dip Sandwich,and the meat was the worst. Other two meals of family that were with me were bad as well. This is my last time there. No more chances."}
{"text":"Having been to the black bear dinners in California, this place had not let me down. The only thing is it took a little long for the bill and for drinks, but other than that the staff was great and the food was amazing! Love their breakfast and you can never go wrong with breakfast for dinner! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and Abel is the best waiter in Vegas!  Unlike every other breakfast place, he offered coffee AS SOON AS WE SAT FOWN!!  Excellent!"}
{"text":"Oh boy this is the way breakfast is supposed to be. Breakfast burrito is awesome and so is the corned beef hash. Biscuits are serious."}
{"text":"Breakfast was great but dinner sucks a true disappointment I gave it a couple try's but it's a step above IHOP at best"}
{"text":"Horrific hostessing. Gave the same 20 min time estimate to every party who walked in. We left after standing around for 45 min and finding out we still had several tables ahead of us. Avoid this place at any time in the morning when it could possibly be busy."}
{"text":"Zero stars! I got food poisoning from this shitty place. Had the chicken and waffles. Sadly my daughter had a piece of the chicken and she is pretty sick as well. Horrible place. My husband had the truth tip meal it was dry as heck."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been eating here for about 3 years, their amount of food is huge! But very good, I've never had bad service whatsoever at this location. Their syrup is amazing! It's right up there with Cracker Barrel's syrup. The manager is really sweet and helpful when it comes to making sure you're happy with your meals and service. Try them out, I promise you'll have some tasty leftovers! I also want to mention if you go for breakfast, ask for Jonathan. He is an awesome server!"}
{"text":"Amazing. I got the grizz which includes two delicious sweet cream pancakes, hash browns, eggs, bacon, sausage, and a ham steak. Everything was freshly made to order and delicious. The hash browns were the best. They were sliced to perfection. Unfortunately, I'm from NJ, but if I come back, I will definitely be there. My mom got the chicken and waffles and my step dad got the bacon BLAST. It came up to around 50 with drinks and tips. Definitely make a visit here."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this place. Usually when I go out for breakfast I compare the place with this place. They serve great American food classics. 

My go to is usually the Big Foot Chicken Fried Steak. It comes with a lot of food and you won't leave hungry. It comes with 2 biscuits which you can add sausage gravy to or I like to sometimes get 2 pancakes instead. We'll get to those later.  The chicken fried steak is a good size with country gravy on top. It also comes with eggs and potatoes. I usually get the hash browns extra crispy. These aren't The frozen hash browns. They are fresh potatoes sliced and fried into deliciousness. 

Back to the pancakes. It's like having dessert after breakfast. They are sweet cream pancakes and are hearty. I'm not a fan of fluffy air pancakes. I like mine dense and hearty. These hit the spot. 

They do have other good food as well. Their burgers are good and the fries are really good too. Their thousand island dressing tastes homemade. 

Service can be hit or miss. Most of the time they are all friendly though. But I still give it a 5 stars."}
{"text":"After trying the diner on Tropicana I was hopeful this location would be as good or better. Those hopes were dashed after were seated and waited 10 minutes for the server to walk by and say he would be right with us. Once he came back we took the opportunity to order both drinks and food since now we were 15 minutes into it experience. We waited and waited for our food for over 35 minutes never once seeing our server. Finally our food arrived, pancakes cold & unappealing just like the rest of the food. We had to go up to the front counter to pay our bill as we had been there over an hour now, others who were seated after us has been on their way somewhere else for awhile now. Pass on this place!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place with fun decor and comfort food this is it! So many adorable bears for decor inside that it makes you feel like you have stepped back in time. Service was excellent and food yummy. I went for breakfast but will definitely come back for lunch or dinner when I'm craving comfort food.  We had pancakes, french toast, scrambled eggs, sausage and ham. All were great. Ham was the best! The OJ is fresh squeezed:)"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly services.  Amazing portion size. Planning a return every vacation."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Vegas I always get a great breakfast at Black Bear. Great service with friendly staff and the chicken fried steak is fresh and delicious. Always huge portions that I can never finish and after a night on the strip, the prices are more than reasonable. Never a bad meal."}
{"text":"This is our place of choice whenever we are in town. The severs are always pleasant & helpful. As you arrive, you are acknowledged and seated promptly. Servers are helpful when you are undecided on menu selection. I definitely recommend for all. Food is delicious & reasonably priced."}
{"text":"A new favorite.  Positive experience from the moment we entered on a busy morning.   Name was taken and only a short wait. Comfortable booths - no squeezing in.  Prompt appearance of our waitress.  The food was excellent. Big portions and lots of flavors.  I ordered the chicken fried steak breakfast and my son had a patty melt with crispy fries.  He asked for a side of blue cheese dressing and it was homemade.  The best I've tasted in a long time.  This diner will be one I come to often!"}
{"text":"Grand opening weekend!  The place was packed!  The wait for a table was forty minutes.  After we were seated and ordered, it took another 40 minutes for our food to arrive.  When it did arrive, the portions were ENORMOUS and the prices were reasonable.  That made the wait worth it.  While we were eating, they brought around the cutest little dessert samples. The theme is adorable and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant. Wonderful service and great food. Really enjoy going there. And the decor is so overly cute."}
{"text":"Clean spotless dining area friendly smiling staff and great food what more can you ask for. My daughter is a picky eater and our waitress designed a meal just perfect for her I was grateful and she was like oh its no problem. Just a total sweetheart.  This was our 3rd time eating there and it won't be our last. They have the best pancakes ever."}
{"text":"I had biscuits and gravy.  They were a very bland representation of biscuits and gravy.  I was sad, because I've been trying to eat more healthily, and that was my morning to splurge on some super salty, greasy, southern cooking.  Sad.

The sausage was good, but the eggs were also bland.

However, their hot cocoa was PERFECT!"}
{"text":"Stopped in the Black Bear Diner today around 11 it was crowded and busy as usual. Plenty of seats at the counter set down they were quick to take my order. Took a little while to get my drinks but I understand it's busy on a Sunday morning. I asked the waitress what she recommended between the turkey club or the burger? She said her all-time favorite was the turkey club that was my first choice so I went with that. Once again wait a little while for the food but not excessively long. They serve my turkey club and I went to eat it and I noticed the sandwich only had meet in the middle nothing on the sides mind you it was wheat bread toast that was your average size white bread so not very big slices. So you would expect there would be plenty of meat on such a small piece of bread literally there was one slice of turkey one slice of ham one slice of lettuce of one slice of tomato one slice of bacon not what you would expect from a turkey club. I think this place is more of a breakfast place since they do a great job on breakfast a very poor job on sandwiches. Not sure I will ever go back there if I do it will definitely not be for lunch or dinner. Sorry I didn't take a picture next time I will."}
{"text":"When my wife and I lived in Laughlin, Nv. they had a Black Bear Diner in Bullhead City, Az. They serve huge portions,  it was all good. Go home and take a nap after you eat here!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  
I have eaten breakfast at 'The Bear' several times and have never been disappointed.  Being from Michigan, I really like the outdoorsy decorations.  Every time I dine there I am reminded of restaurants in upper Michigan.

The food is delicious, people are friendly, and I love that the menu is presented in newspaper format.  

Beware that this place gets very busy on weekends so prepare for a wait if you dine at peak hours.  Let me tell you, it is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb. For the healthy or non healthy eaters. Quality! Good service too!"}
{"text":"I. 
Was so. 
Hungry. 

Eryka took care of us, even after a stuttered over ordering an \"Arnold Palmer.\" The service was great throughout our visit. Perfect 10!

They've got a bacon cheeseburger in a bowl. Perfect for this L.A. girl to feel like she's still eating a tad bit healthy. 

And I mean, the pies. THE PIES. When we sat down, we were hungry to the nth degree, so I of course ordered too many things (yeaux leaux) and we eyed those desserts the whole time we ate! We got full halfway through our meal, but I was determined to order a pie before I left. The waitress laughed at how excited we were - I even sang and danced as it got wrapped to go! My friend and I shared a coconut cream pie and I literally have no ragrets. Not even a single letter. 

I enjoy places that have an open diner bar/kitchen window and more than generous portions. Black Bear Diner also has there hot sauces and other cute souvenirs for sale in the front. 


I will definitely be returning the next time I am in Henderson. 

I still need a photo with the adorable bear family out front."}
{"text":"I love this diner.  They give you a ton of food for a good price.  They have a good family atmosphere.  I go here on a monthly basis and have never received a bad meal."}
{"text":"I love the exterior and interior decors. The breakfast are very good. I really enjoy dinning. Great services and good food."}
{"text":"Great place for good food and big portions! We've only had breakfast here, but it's definitely worth the $8-10 per entree. The food is very fresh, and the biscuits are huge!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. I sat at my table for 15 minutes after the host seated me and not one person came to take my order. At least 4 different servers walked by me and nobody said anything. The restaurant had maybe 6 tables, it was 8:30 pm on Monday 24 April. 

After the remodel I would think the staff would be on their A game to win back the customers that went somewhere else to eat during the weeks that they were closed. 

I will not be back, they lost a loyal customer. Sad"}
{"text":"Been here twice, first time was great, second time was meh. First time I had the blt and it was great. Waitress was great. Service was great. Second time I ordered a new york strip medium rare and received it medium well. It was chewy, dry and I thanked big guns upstairs for the hot sauces which made it easier to eat. The potatoes and toast were good though. When I go back, I'll stick to the sandwiches or a salad, they look huge!"}
{"text":"Everything is mediocre....service, food, coffee. My sister and I ordered chicken fried steak and California eggs Benny. Both of us had to season our plate 3x's.  I wish we read the reviews before coming here...sounds like the customer service is what brings people here not the food."}
{"text":"We just enjoyed brunch here, and this is our second time at this location (not to mention we've eaten at the location on Bell Rd a number of times). This is always a solid choice if you're craving breakfast food. I had the Shasta Scramble (a vegetarian dish) with a pancake and the boyfriend had their Chorizo Breakfast Burrito (without chorizo, since he's vegetarian) and ordered a biscuit. They have large portions, so you're absolutely getting value for your dollar, and everything is always cooked well. We enjoy their own brand of hot sauces that they have at every table, and we always walk away with happily full stomachs. The servers and staff are always friendly and eager to assist you. You can't go wrong with Black Bear!"}
{"text":"Great food and service, Fried Chicken is back and better than ever. Awsome and great times hear with family and friend's. Thank you Black Bear staff great work always good times."}
{"text":"I love this place its so good and big portions! the bear claw is soooo good. great place to go for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Like others have said - still working things out. We went for late breakfast. Arrived slightly before 1pm and had a short wait. Once seated, order taken timely enough...then we waited - over 40 min later (and numerous excuses) no breakfast. What made us walk out was when they were more concerned with giving someone they birthday ice cream with all hands on deck rather than find out why we had no food. Our server was very nice however. We were really hoping for a great place to go close to home..."}
{"text":"I was here this morning for breakfast . Absolutely loved it I was actually trying to find another breakfast place near by but couldn't find it so black bear it was and the food was awesome . Had the valcano it was delicious . Great food great staff ."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Food potions are large and service was excellent.  A bit of of a wait but not bad.   Would definitely come back the next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Lovely family friendly diner with decent size portions. Breakfast is a must. Burgers and tri tip sandwiches are delish as well"}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place, I had to check it out today. It's a Sunday, brunch rush and the place is packed. We are greeted immediately and seated in the only open table. We are offered drinks immediately and it only takes about one minute for them to arrive. 
It not a place you would expect to find in Las Vegas, very niche'.  It had a warm, welcoming feel. 
All of the staff was extremely friendly and my server, Marlaina was very attentive, knowledgable about the menu and her recommendations were delicious. 
Our food arrived quickly, about ten minutes after ordering. We ordered the Tri-tip sandwich and pulled pork sandwich. Both extremely tender, the pulled pork has a wonderful spicy kick to it, but not too overwhelming. 
Marlaina checked on us appropriately, and had a great personality. 
The only thing that was going to keep me from giving a 5 star review was the carpets were very dirty, but they were cleaned during my visit and considering how great everything was and how busy they were, I'm going to stick with a five star. 
I will definitely be back and I recommend you try it out too!"}
{"text":"Outstanding, a real gem!

We were in Goodyear AZ for 5 days. We found The Black Bear through a Yelp Breakfast search and didn't see a point in trying any place else. Great food and great service. We had Breakfast there every day.From the homemade corn beef hash and sausages to the biscuits all are OUTSTANDING!"}
{"text":"Awesome place food is great! Friendly atmosphere anyone that complains can great at McDonald's love you guys keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Had it not been for Yelp and Philip T's recent visit, I don't know that I ever would have discovered the Black Bear Diner. I am quite certain this was my best breakfast experience in recent memory and possibly the best Chicken Fried Steak I've had in Vegas. They have knifes big enough to take down a tree, but there is no need. Tender and flaky, a fork was all I needed to tackle this breakfast feast. I went with country potatoes cooked up fresh with peppers and onions. It comes standard with a  biscuit or toast. I opted to substitute a pancake, which Candy obliged without hesitation. The pancake was so good we passed it around the table and ordered two more. They come with plenty of piping hot syrup, which is a good thing because JR drenched his pants with the first one. No need to wax this week. The over-easy eggs were cooked to perfection and the coffee was better than average. Our server, Candy, was as friendly as they come and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. Great food, friendly staff and, with buddies like JR, great entertainment."}
{"text":"Great food...the bread pudding is to die for. The service is excellent and the restaurant is clean and decorated with lots of black bears...too cute! The turkey club is delish, and the minestrone soup is very tasty. On a different visit I had the corned beef hash for breakfast. It was from scratch not a can and the potatoes it came with were very tasty! I ordered a biscuit and it was fresh and humongous!! New fave place!!"}
{"text":"Yummy food large portions. The staff is very friendly, food takes awhile but it's worth the wait"}
{"text":"My 3rd BBD that I have been to... I would like to say that it is as good as the one in Torrance Ca which was my first and the one that all others now are compared to but alas now on two occasions the service has been lacking and that is a real turnoff for myself and the family... Portions are still good, but I do miss the Cinnamon Rolls ( no longer offered)...."}
{"text":"Awesome food and a cute atmosphere combine to make one of the best American breakfast eateries in SW Vegas!
If you like Ranch dressing (on fries or whatever) I think theirs is one of the best. It's thick and creamy and has a robust buttermilk ranch flavor.
If you're lucky enough to get seated in Angela's section then you'll really be well taken care of. Got the order exactly right, topped off fluids when they were nearing critically low levels and had a smile on her face and bounce in her step every time she visited our booth.  
An all around great experience! 5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best breakfast place in town. They do a super lunch and dinner as well, but I usually can't get off the breakfast selections. The \"California Omelette\" (Avocados, Mushrooms, and Jack Cheese) is superb, as is \"The Volcano\" which is made up of three fluffy / yummy pancakes, sausage, bacon, and eggs. 

As other reviewers have noted, portions are ginormous. Go planning to share a selection or take at least another meal home with you. There can be a wait on the weekend, but once you get seated, service is prompt and attentive. (Albeit the Fuzzie Bear that walks around can get a little creepy around the fourth table pass).

BBD is supposed to be known for their desserts and they do look good, but the blackberry pie that I took home was more than a little tart and the crust was on the tough side. I wouldn't let this stop you from sampling as it could have been an isolated experience based on their reputation.

There are actually a few locations in the Phoenix area, so visit their website to see which one is closest to you.  http://blackbeardiner.com/location/

This definately isn't your parent's Denny's!"}

{"text":"I was told to come here by my 70 year old parents.  That should have been my first red flag.  I know this place gets good reviews but I still am not sure how.  It is a pretty ratty diner with homeless people sleeping outside and subpar food that is lower quality than what you would find at Denny's. We found the place to be dirty, the clientele to be a little to redneck for our taste and the food to be greasy and not in a yummy cure my hangover good greasy way. Go to IHOP on Bell and the 101 instead."}
{"text":"Im from NY and we have some of the best diners around and as i drove by this place 100 times i always said this has got to be horrible. I came for breakfast and had the bacon cakes and they were delicious. Didn't understand the lettuce garnish though but whatever \"lol\". I'll be back here!"}
{"text":"Ok wanted to like the place cause it's cute but this is the 3rd time I've came here and every time there has been a problem. I got the Grizz and the pancakes were great but everything else was ice cold, my sausage was undercooked and the hash browns i asked for well done 3 trips in a row didnt make em well done either time. I am done trying this place. If you want a real good breakfast goto Sunrise Cafe."}
{"text":"There was a 20 minute wait at 2 o'clock on a Sunday, so I thought that was a good sign of a great restaurant. Not so much. The whole place was filthy. My shoes stuck to the carpet at the register. Avoid the restrooms at all costs. The food was overpriced for the quality. I ordered my burger well done. It was pink. Will not be going back. Oh, two stars instead of one because the Parmesan kettle chips were delicious."}
{"text":"We found this place by accident and it was great! We are coffee snobs and find it difficult to get a great cup when we travel, but we actually enjoyed theirs very much. Their breakfasts are huge and yummy. My husband had the corned beef hash and he loved it because it wasn't the usual greasy hash you get at a diner. I had the pancakes and they were super yummy. Definitely coming back next time we are in Vegas. The staff was happy and friendly too!!"}
{"text":"So excited this location is now open in the Southwest! I'm a HUGE fan of BBD and this location did not disappoint! My Mom and I drove by on a whim to see if they were open and they were! Abel was our waiter and he was so attentive, friendly and just a pleasure! The food was on point as always and we can't wait to come back! I will most definitely be utilizing the online ordering app asap!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love it. I tried the bacon Blast with onion rings and as always, they delivered. My family got the western burger, chicken fingers, and pancakes and they loved it. The servers are amazing. I love this place."}
{"text":"We ate here twice in one week. The food is hot and delicious and even though the restaurant is always packed your food comes out in a timely manner. My husbands meal was so big it was 3 meals in one. The price is very good for what you get. We don't have this restaurant back home so I'm glad we tried it. We will definitely have it again before we go back home. Must try spot!"}
{"text":"Always sad to report when we are not impressed with a location, but that was our experience.

First timers and the service was lacking.  The waitress seemed a little put off at times and not very attentive.  They didn't have enough utensils clean so we had to wait.  Then they just piled them on the table.  Didn't even separate.  Dishes were still wet.  My son's glass was coated in dry dish soap. 

Boys had French toast and both looked amazing and tasted great.  Coffee was horrid, my girl friend described it as \"drinking from a dirty buttcrack\".  My GF had the Juevos Rancheros,  she was excited then disappointed as the tostada shell was rock hard.  She asked for no tomatoes and it had them anyways.  I had the chorizo scramble.  It was good minus the burnt hash browns.  You can see them on my plate, had to remove the top layer.

Overall it was slightly above average.  French toast is great, for sure.  Service is lacking.  She never offered to refill anyone's drinks, except mine.  Literally nobody got a refill with the exception of my drink.  Cost was $53 for all 4 of us which is a tad higher than expected, but not outrageous.

Unfortunately my family will not be returning.  Still on the look out for a nice brunch place in Goodyear/Litchfield."}
{"text":"My family and I We've been here a handful of times, the food is good, huge portions for the price. It does get busy very quickly with wait times averaging for 4 people 15-20 min. The wait staff takes a bit longer to get going. I've noticed all the times we've gone they seat you and then let you sit for quite sometime before coming back to take your order/drinks. I'm not sure if their theory is to give you enough time to order all at once or what but keep this in mind, as they run at a slower pace.  I'd return again, but we just always come with the mindset of knowing there's a wait."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Love the layout and bear theme! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Foods always good! Waitresses are nice, and it's clean! Never had a prob with this spot! Really good atmosphere area, great for groups, classical music always playing in the background. Definitely one of my never fail me spots when you can't figure out where to eat."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a Black Bear Diner, and I must say it was an overall great experience! The service was very nice and the food very delicious. I had a bacon and cheddar cheeseburger, and it was a behemoth of a burger. I was afraid I wouldn't finish it, but once I tasted it, I was done before I knew it. It was that damn good. The diner itself feels very homey with a country feel. It's easy to forget you're in the middle of Vegas. I'll definitely be back if given the opportunity."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast, mom had the SCRAMbowl and I had the Acapulco scramble. Moms dish was ALOT of food. Only thing was potatoes were not consistently cooked. Some were under done some were cooked ok. The biscuit was phenomenal! Bacon was undercooked for our taste, but can see how others would be ok with it. Only complaint for the scramble was the strawberries weren't that fresh, but ok."}
{"text":"I am giving this location three stars due to them redeeming themselves with my chicken fried steak. When my chicken fried steak came out the gravy looked like someone puked instead of it being white country gravy because of that they were originally two stars!  I asked for the Manager and I explained to him and he said this should have not left the kitchen like this, it does not take that long to make new gravy!  What does that tell me???  Well I gave them the extra star when they redeemed themselves with a fresh new order and he comped it!  C'mon black bear I have been to numerous other black bears and they have all been damn good!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast hands down. The environment, the food, the service overall. Only complaint is they made it obvious when frustrated at my family member for not wanting onions in what she ordered. Pretty common request and other than that it was awesome!! We were on vacation and wish we could've gone there every morning during our stay."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch a few weeks ago.  It was ok, not great, not terrible, and not particularly worth visiting. 

The food didn't seem to be cooked quite right in texture or flavor.  I was kinda disappointed because a friend of mine loves this place so I was expecting great things.  

Even the pie was disappointing!  Pie should never be disappointing!"}
{"text":"I actually give this place 1/2. The complaints I have are minor and this is only our first visit. We will definitely be back! The pancakes are incredible!! I loved the ham steak as well it was not too salty! The biscuits and gravy are good and so are the hashbrowns. The bacon was pretty salty and the eggs were eggs. There are a few things on the menu that I can't wait to try but for today we split the Grizzle and a side of B & G and we are absolutely stuffed! It's a great place to eat, the staff is friendly  , and the food is pretty delicious!!"}
{"text":"Very clean and friendly. The food is great and quick. We've gone to the Redding location before and we were hoping it would be the same. It was actually better"}
{"text":"Great tasting food large portions and a rustic view of bears everywhere. 
Upon entering you are greeted with a bearish 
smile the waite will be worth the waite. 
 The menu is printed in a news format called The Black bear gazette.
  After eating their is a giftshop with a plethera of bears."}
{"text":"This location will be closing by the end of April. If you go now you can get a 15% off and a free entree for your next visit to the 67th Ave and Bell Rd one.. I am a little bummed!"}
{"text":"This is one of my most favorite places to eat breakfast. Service is amazing, food is delicious and prices are very reasonable! I recommend Black Bear Diner to everyone! Ask to be seated in Mindy's section. She has the best personality. She is so funny, always on top of her service and can answer any questions you have. I totally recommend coming to Black Bear Diner!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch today after our doctor appointment . We love going here cause this place is sooo nice and cozy. Food is always good. This place is always busy and i can see why. All the dish i've tried are just amazing . My first experience here was just perfect!!! I would of giving them 5 stars if the service today wasn't so bad. The girl who served us was very nice and all so i really dont want to put her name down. But she was very good at taking orders and getting things to us. She keep on forgetting to bring us stuff until i have to remind her. And when i asked for the check , it took her sooo long to come back with it. In fact i have to walk up to her and get it because we were running late . And also told her to cancel out the other order since it never came and we were running late so we have no more time to wait. I also had order to go and when she handed the bag to me, i can see my spaghetti sauce is spilling out of the box onto the plastic bag. Total mess with the service today . But i just love the food here. I'll still be coming back because i really enjoy the food . Just hope that the service will be better the next time im there."}
{"text":"Food was pretty decent. But service was slow. So slow we ordered on Thursday and food arrived Sunday. Ok maybe not that slow but pretty slow. Plus the server got an order wrong. Management made no attempt to comp anything. So we won't be going back"}
{"text":"Everything you could ever want in a diner complete with a nice country-feel and a surplus of bears, beats, and Battlestar Galactica! (just kidding about those last two)

The interior is chock full of bear decorations as the name suggests. It reminded me of the diners I used to frequent in Upstate New York with my great-grandparents as a child. Upon entering on a busy Friday night, the three of us were quickly seated. I opted for 'The Grizz', their breakfast special which includes two pancakes, bacon, a small ham steak, two sausages, three eggs prepared to your liking, and choice of potatoes. Along with this Ron Swanson approved meal, I got a cup of their delicious house coffee to wash it all down. Everything was completely satisfactory as far as my meal went. Our waitress was on her game and all of the food items came out cooked to perfection, which is really all you can ask for in a basic meal such as this. The prices were reasonable enough and we all left with a stuffed bellies and smiles on our faces."}
{"text":"Tonight I got the chicken Caesar salad sandwich with no chicken with a side of Parmesan chips. They were good. My friend got a burger with onion rings. Everyone was super nice, despite us coming late. There was hardly any wait. After being here for both types of meals I can say they offer good breakfast & dinner options, even for vegetarians. We got the chocolate cream pie & I loved the crust. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Well this has been the worst I have had here at BB GValley, food was lousy!. Waited 35 mins for food and the food sucked, cold and they got the orders wrong. It seem to me that they did not have there shit together, I mean I love the place, but not this location. West side BB and Laughlin/Bullhead city is the bomb. This location need to step up their game if they really want to make BB proud. $80/4 persons down the freakin drain!! Buffet would of been a better choice cause food would have been hotter and quicker and saved some $$"}
{"text":"By far our most favorite place for breakfast, we always go to the Black bear in Havasu too! Came into Glendale location for a Saturday breakfast to sit down for a change-since we usually take to go. Again.. DELICIOUS food, I had the California Benedict- YUMM, hubby had meat lovers omelette and he's taking half home.  I had to write the 4 star review since the services literally was HORRIBLE! We waited and waited and waited for every single thing! No drink refills, would stop at other tables with our food/drinks and go to her manager to ask before dropping off.  I would request a new server if I had again. C'mon black bear we've always known you for amazon food and service- ** disappointed **"}
{"text":"Had lunch with my mom today, one of the best customer service experiences I have ever had . Our waiter Robert aka Joe was very nice explaining the favorites and brought the food out in a timely manner.  I highly recommend this to all my friends."}
{"text":"Try this place if you're ever craving a big, delicious breakfast. The place is huge so
I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated. The customer service is great and always serves you with a smile."}
{"text":"Yuck!! Food had no flavor, salmon was raw, potatoes where raw!! Gave me the runs the next day. Go to biscuits cafe!!! I hate to leave a bad review, the staff was awesome but the food is horrible"}
{"text":"I must say, right now I am really sad! I typically love Black Bear Diner, but wow, this specific location has taken a nose dive in the last year or so! I usually come in the morning for breakfast and the staff during that shift are great! We always get quick service and the food has always been good. 

Now however, let's fast forward to the night shift. My hunny ordered the fish and chips, which the fish was cold in the center and the fries were merely warm-not hot. I got the chicken parmesan, which the sauce tasted as though it had sat in a warmer all day. I have not ever had a meal for 2 people that costed more than $35.00 only to have both of us be disappointed. Usually one can be bummed because we might not like what we picked, but to both be grossed out because the food was horrible - that's sad. And just trying to pay and leave was a battle. We stood at the register for almost 5 minutes waiting for a high school girl come up and provide some not great customer service. She had offered to get the manager, but if I didn't walk out at the moment I did, I might be in jail for showing her how disappointed I was. I refuse to be sneered at by some teenager with a dirty dish rag hanging out of her apron!
Needless to say, we won't be visiting this location, at night, ever again!"}
{"text":"The service was a little off. I didn't find our host particularly friendly.  The food was okay. I ordered a bacon burger that was on par with something I'd get at Carls Jr., only for twice the price. I do like the cabin theme and Midwest diner vibe, but everything else was sub-par this visit."}
{"text":"Good food. Great biscuits and fresh OJ.
If you want a traditional breakfast, Black Bear is the place!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat breakfast in Arizona! When we go out for spring training each year, its a must we stop when we arrive in AZ , and as we leave AZ! Gets pretty packed but they get people in quick. Love their omelettes and all dishes are huge portions and good service. They even sell their own hot sauce which is good too! Recommend Papa Burn sauce"}
{"text":"I've been to one of their locations in Colorado Springs I believe it was several years ago so I was very happy to see that they put in that abandon chilis

I've been two this place last sat from Breakfast and tonight for Dinner.

For breakfast I had their chicken fried steak and eggs and their massive biscuits and hash browns, not the most incredible breakfast ever but so many good things to like about it so a solid four stars, I still wish they had a Cracker Barrel out here this isn't too far behind it
Dinner tonight was a little different closer to 3 1/2 stars I have to try tip and ribs combo dinner with the try tip was very tasty maybe I'm just a person who expecting a bigger portion tonight and seemed a little under sized but very good flavor, and the ribs were nothing to write home about, but the tropical tea and green beans are very tasty and the mash potatoes a leith country gravy not bad and a massive portion

So 3 1/2 stars tonight, 4 stars last time, this is definitely a place I can see myself going to once every month or so it's not right down the street from me but it's worth a little 5 mile drive"}
{"text":"Ok, this review is only for one meal-honesty upfront.
I've eaten at the Paradise Ca one, but only breakfast- which was pretty good. 

With that in mind, I ran over to have a bite before a concert. I almost went to an old standby-Cafe Boa- because it never lets me down.
But
I figured I didn't want to pay 16.00 for dinner that night, and hence made a poor choice to go to the Tempe Black Bear Diner.

Was early, no wait (or maybe others have already decided ugh-not!) waitress was sweet.

Brought me water that I took one sip of and gagged-tasted like dirt or mud. Sounds weird. It was crystal clear. Huh? I asked for bottled- didn't have, so I asked for another try. Ugh! Same dirt flavour. I mentioned it and she said that she didn't like their water either.  I asked if any drink they sold wasn't made with their water and she said lemon aid.  She apologised  and said she wouldn't charge me for the drink-since I didn't really want it. Since I was soooo thirsty I got that. Was good- but I NEVER drink sweet with dinner. Oh well

I ordered the meatloaf- don't know why. Guess I figured you can't screw that up.

You can.

It was so damned bland- was like eating unseasoned burger meat. Bland bland bland. 

I just had to choke it down as much as I could.
But the seasonal veggies were very good. That's what I ate all of. The mashed potatoes were bland too.

At the end, my bill was almost 16.00!  She had charged me the 2.75 for lemonaid. She was no where to be seen for 5 min- so I just paid and left.

There are SO many better-and cheaper places than this in Tempe.  Yeah, the bear stuff is cute.
Go look at it- and eat somewhere else!!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday morning. Superrrr busy! We waited about 40 mins!  Though it was pretty good! Better than a dennys or IHOP for sure. The food tasted fresh and not too greasy. The service was pretty good but I wished the waiter would check back on us a little more."}
{"text":"My mom and I decided to go here for brunch after walking around the nearby outlet mall. This place is very easy to find. Decor was minimal but very cute and Bear themed. 
We were seated almost immediately and our server Brett took our drink orders. We decided to split \"The Grizz\" and when our order came to our table, we were both relieved that we decided to split. The order came on two platters. One platter had 2 strips of bacon, 2 sausages, a ham steak, 3 eggs and potatoes on it. The other platter had two sweet cream pancakes bigger than my face. It was pretty impressive. Now, there's not much to say about bacon, eggs and ham. Those are pretty hard to mess up. The sausage was absolutely delicious and juicy! And the potatoes were season perfectly and served with bell pepper and onions. The star of the meal was definitely the pancakes! I will never attempt to make pancakes at home ever again! They were nice and fluffy and perfectly cooked. The dusting of powdered sugar with butter and syrup made it even more delicious! 
Our server, Brett was very attentive and made sure our drinks never ran out. 
We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Marlene from the night shift supervisor.
Amazing doesn't begin to start to explain our first experience at Black Bear.
She was welcoming and friendly. 
She accommodated all of our ours and the food was delicious. 
Huge portions. Hearty food. 
If I could give it more stars I would."}
{"text":"I like this place.  Rustic feel, love the bear theme and all the carvings and pictures on the wall.  They also have a traditional juke box that pays the oldies but goldies music.  Serving staff always seems to be on top of things and man can you get huge portions if you want."}
{"text":"I always enjoy my meals at Black Bear Diner and today was no different. I ordered the volcano dish which was loaded with their sweet pancakes, sausage, bacon, and eggs. A large meal for a great price.  Will be back, again, and again, and again."}
{"text":"When u order anything and don't want it greasy make sure you tell them light on the grease or oil otherwise it will come served greasy.  Service is slow.  Food is ok.  I was here 3 time and all 3 times something happened.  2 time here the counter girl double charged my credit card.  3 rd time waitress help other tables that came after us before helping us.  This makes service slow.  The veggies were bad and served brown, greasy.  Manager was awesome and corporate was great in responding to problems."}
{"text":"Huge portions the food is very fresh and tasty and blows away other pancake houses. This location was very busy and staff although friendly they were a bit short and service was frenzy. The decor is bears and woods could have been a bit more friendly and customer friendly."}
{"text":"Came in tonight around 7:30 with three kids and two adults and we were promptly seated. The waitress was initially prompt and took our order. The ordering process went smoothly with one exception in which the waitress stopped mid-order to verify the price on a side order of biscuits. It seemed strange but she recovered quickly. The first salad came out very quickly and I thought \"Wow - great decision for a Hungry group with kids.\"  The food came out shortly thereafter and I was very satisfied with the fish fry. Normally I would rate the food a solid 3 stars and perhaps bump up the rating to 4 stars with great service, but unfortunately after our food came out, our waitress literally disappeared. We had to practically beg to get our drinks refilled and we went for long periods of time before she checked on us. The restaurant was not overly busy. I requested that the waitress bring a box out for the food which is normally a sign of \"hey - we are ready to leave\" but it was at least 15 minutes before we saw her again to request the check after bringing us the box. It was really frustrating and because of the experience, I'm not sure I want to go back. The food is good overall, but I can get equally good food and much better service somewhere else."}
{"text":"Another cozy breakfast place.

I am a sucker for black coffee and eggs diner type places, so please understand that I actually sort of like that crappy diner taste...

That being said, I've had 2 great experiences here so far.

The service has been a real pleasure.  The servers are friendly and fast and will go out of their way to help with special requests or order mix ups.

The prices aren't bad, and the food is pretty good.  Basic breakfast fare.

I like that there's a jukebox that will play random songs from just about every era (even some 30's and 40's throwbacks).

When I walked in at 6:30am one morning, they were playing old-timey bluegrass.  And the interior design is like the inside of a log cabin.

I love that kind of kitschy-ness so it works for me!"}
{"text":"The portions are very generous. The prices are extremely reasonable. And the food is down-home good! 

We had a huge chicken fried steak and just as big meatloaf. Both among the best we've ever had. The sides of mashed and gravy was delicious and fries were crispy good!

They were out or soup so salad accompanied the meal. It was okay but we'd be keen on trying the apparently popular soup instead. 

Desserts looked awesome but we just didn't have any room. Service was also fantastic. Attentive, informative and even humorous!

We'll look forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"The Black Bear Diner is perfect for a family going out to eat. Our party consisted of two grandparents, two parents, one aunt and an 18 month old. We were promptly seated by the host. All of the staff members were friendly with prompt service and good food. On the list for another visit!"}
{"text":"Monica was an amazing server really knowledgeable and was very nice food was good but her service was the highlight of the trip"}
{"text":"The pancakes are crazy!! Me and my boo love coming here for brunch and splitting The Grizz. So much meat, so much fluffy pancake goodness, so much beat decor. Favorite breakfast spot by far. We've gotten to the point where when I ask my girl where she wanna go to eat, she doesn't even have to say where, I just see that sparkle in her eye that lets me know that she's got the craving for some of that Black Bear goodness. It never lets us down. Shout out to the wait staff for always getting us our food FAST and with great service. You gotta check out these CAKES"}
{"text":"Terrible service, food would've been good if there wasn't a hair in my food. Then, when I got my second plate I asked for over HARD eggs and got raw eggs. The manager then asked why I didn't want to eat my food."}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner is my go to breakfast restaurant. However this time I did dinner. It was 30 minutes before closing and the staff welcomed us as if they were opening for the day.  Though they ran out of what I was hoping for (chicken pot pie), we order the pot roast. The meat was tender, the vegetables cut to bite size.  The cornbread they served was warm and melted in your mouth.
Part of our party ordered breakfast. The portions of food were well received. Everything served was fresh.
We will definitely come back again for dinner."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite places for breakfast. The food always comes in gigantic portions, so make sure you're hungry when you go. 

The restaurant is decorated like a Mountain Lodge, and reminds me of something that would be in Northern California. I think that's where the first Black Bear was started. 

The menu looks like an old newspaper from the 50s, and there's so many things to choose from. The Portuguese Linguisa (sausage) excellent and they have the best coffee. There's nothing like good, hearty, home style cooking."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a negative star I would. First, the customer service was horrible. Candy was our server and she seemed like she didn't like us there. Very short with us and a bit rude. We ordered our food and waited. I was hoping the food would make up for the lack of service. As we are waiting for the food, candy (server) was walking around helping all the other customers with a smile and very nice. I'm thinking, that is weird. Maybe when she gives our food to us, she will be nice now. The food comes and Candy says excuse me! and throws my plate down and does the same with my BF. Wow! WTF did we do? Whatever, by this time, I'm like let's just eat our food and leave ASAP. She made me feel so uncomfortable. She went to other tables and she was chatting and laughing and recommending items to customers. I have never felt so uncomfortable and confused in my life. 
Onto the food review:  I take a bite of my Tri tip sandwich (blazin bear sandwich) and it is cold. The bread and the tri tip was very cold. It came straight out of the refrigerator and onto my plate. The most disgusting thing I have eaten. I couldn't even finish my food. The Tri tip was hard and dry cause it was so cold. Not sure how they can serve food colder than room temperature, when what you ordered was suppose to be a hot sandwich?? I ended up eating my fries, since that was the only edible thing. My BF ordered the grizz. The bacon was cold and soggy like it was cooked hours ago. My BF complained that the pancakes tasted funny, so me loving pancakes, I told him if I can have some of his pancakes since my food wasn't edible. I took a bite of the pancake and realized it was raw. The pancake was gooey in the middle and uncooked batter. That was my last straw. I wanted to leave whenever candy came back. She gave us the bill and I payed up front and left as fast as I can."}
{"text":"Absolutely love love love eating breakfast here!!! Huge servings so it's good enough to share. My boyfriend I always come for breakfast when visiting Vegas. I love the fact that they also have these diners up north too. I would totally recommend this place to anyone who loves down home
Country food."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for breakfast. The service is always friendly and attentive. Food comes out amazingly quick. I highly recommend their Bacon Benedict, and a stack of some of the best pancakes you'll ever have."}
{"text":"The food here is great majority of the time I go here, occasionally, well more now than before when I first went there, the fries are always old and chewy. Everything else there is top notch"}
{"text":"For some reason, I never seem to eat fried chicken when I go to a restaurant as I usually prefer to make it myself. However, for some reason I seemed to want fried chicken today, so I ordered it. I must say, that this was the best fried chicken I had eaten in a very long time. It was crispy and had such a wonderful crunch and taste. I wanted to look and see if my Louisiana grandmother was back in the kitchen cooking this up, but I knew better as grandma left us many years ago. It came with \"real\" homemade mashed potatoes and white gravy, green beans seasoned with bacon and onions, salad and a corn muffin. Needless to say I ate all of it and felt as though I needed to be rolled out of there. So, I highly recommend their fried chicken and I will be back soon to sample their other items, all of it just like homemade!"}
{"text":"I was referred here a while back. This was my first visit to the Black Bear Diner. It was awesome! The price is great and the fill your large plate with food. I had the \"volcano\". We were stuffed! The food was awesome, I was pleasantly surprised. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Always good for breakfast!!!

We have this place back at home in Washington and its just as good!"}
{"text":"Service was a bit rushed but good overall. The cubano was delicious and huge. Their french fries are a must have, salty and crispy the way they should be. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were recommended to come here by coworkers. Best decision for breakfast! We loved it! Tons of options and amazing food! It was very good! They also have huge portions! Very reasonable prices! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went for breakfast on a Saturday morning and it was busy but that's to be expected. It was our dirt time here so we were excited to try something new. We were seated in about 20 min for the two of us which was great because of how packed it was in there. One of the best things they offer is the fresh squeezed orange juice and fresh fluffy biscuits. Just starting off with those we knew our breakfast would be bomb. My fiancée got the California Bacon Benedict (bacon on the side for me ) and I got the breakfast with French toast, two eggs and bacon. They were both absolutely amazing and our waitress had great customer service and was always smiling even when she was super busy. Will definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"I remember when this place used to be Chili's a few years ago.  When we pulled up I had the feeling like I had been here before and when I when into my thoughts from the past I realized that I had been to this place when it was Chili's.  Now it's BLACK BEAR DINER.  It's totally remodeled on the inside and has a log cabin look and feel to it.  

One of the more disappointing aspects of the visit is that don't have appetizers.  I didn't know this and I was planning on totaling pigging out tonight. The kind of pig out where you take no prisoners or names.  So I ordered the onion rings which were amazing.  Golden crisp batter surrounded the onion and be prepared to wipe your hands after each rings...just a little greasy.  

Next up....breakfast for dinner.  I normally default to breakfast if the other meals look suspect or I'm not feeling dinner.  The potatoes were the bomb.  The bacon was burned....badly.  The over easy eggs were just ok.  They weren't seasoned with anything so make sure if you order the eggs ask for seasoning.  The ham was great.  I finished my meal off with the pancakes.  They were awesome.  The substituted as desert.  



Service was great!    With that being said if your looking for old school music and an old school feel give this place a try.  May the force be with you."}
{"text":"I signed up online to become a Black Bear Diner club member. The next day I received a beautiful email instructing me to print it for a free bear claw and cup of coffee. My husband and I jumped in the car to visit the Black Bear Diner.

This restaurant is like the Black Bear version of Cracker Barrel.  The ambiance is filled with stuffed bears all along the top of the walls and a big bear totem-like structure in the middle of the restaurant. There is a gift shelf stocked with tshirts, loganberry syrup, etc. if you want to buy a souvenir.  

The food is good and it is definitely a family restaurant. It's clean and the employees are very attentive.  Angela was our waitress and took her job duties very seriously.  I had my bear claw which could feed 2 people! The coffee was good but I like my coffee very strong which it wasn't. Hubby had chicken fried steak and eggs and was very happy with his breakfast.

I perused the rest of the menu and if you are vegetarian you won't have a problem with breakfast items. If you are vegan well there is only a seasonal fruit plate or salad. I really wish that this restaurant offered a vegetarian /vegan burger or even a vegetable platter.

The pies and cobblers in the front case looked exquisite. 

There was a mango tea advertised which made an excellent mocktail. Black bear diner doesn't serve alcohol. 

All in all we will visit again."}
{"text":"This place belongs to a small local chain, but it doesn't look like that. As we entered, the manager and some waiters greeted us very friendly and we were sitted immediately. The place is a typical American diner, except for the fact that it's full of bears!! Stuffed animals, paintings, staff's shirts, even the sauce bottles and the napkins have bears signs on them, not to speak of my waffle... So the ambience becomes really funny and enjoyable!
Quality/prices ratio is also great. We had more than decent (still not extraordinary) food at a good value and we exited the place full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Breakfast was awesome and reasonable.  Very friendly restaurant and great service, you can't ask for anything more than!  Great work team."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing place. Best breakfast place I've been too in quite a while. I reckoned the Bigfoot chicken fried steak if you are quite the eater!"}
{"text":"I wasn't super  impressed.  My friend have me rave reviews so we checked it out.  There was a 20 minute wait,  which could be excused if the food was outstanding but it was only alright for my money.  Service was subpar and it took 45 minutes to get my food.  If you're in the area why not, but definitely wouldn't travel to eat here again."}
{"text":"My favorite is the
Egg white Veggie Omelet 
Golden brown hash browns
One Pancake
Fresh orange juice

Their biscuit is ginormous. My gf puts butter and honey on it. It's usually busy for breakfast so expect a wait, especially on the wknds. I'd give them five stars but the mgr and other staff don't pay attn to my order and always put powdered sugar on my pancake."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of chain Family Restaurants but on occasion when my family gets together we will come here.
The service is pretty good for the most part. The atmosphere is exactly what you would expect as is the menu.
Food is quite good and plenty of it. Prices are reasonable for portion size.
Most recently I had a gigantic burger with fries and the rest of my family had the fish and chips. Burger was excellent and everyone really enjoyed their fish and chips. Overall, great value and reliably good food."}
{"text":"A neighborhood gem, Black Bear Diner takes you out of Vegas and into what the Mt. Charleston Lodge probably SHOULD look like. Stuffed bears everywhere. A very old town vibe. The food was pretty good--I had the apple chicken sausage with red potatoes and eggs. Not bad for my first time and I will probably visit a second time to try out their famous chicken fried steak.

Food 3.5/5

{"text":"My husband and I really enjoy this place. We usually come here once every week or two. 

The staff is always friendly and the portions are big!! We typically order breakfast. Off the breakfast menu I have yet to be disappointed. 

Yesterday I tried their version of a French dip and unfortunately that was disappointing. It just didn't seem to have a lot of flavor and was the worst meal here by far.  The redeeming factor was my side of onion rings 

I would definitely recommend this place but based on my sandwich experience, stick with breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Yummy Yummy for your tummy!  A classic iconic menu of comfort foods from chicken pot pie, meatloaf & potatoes to the homemade baked pies!  

Be sure to bring your appetite as portions are large!!! Food taste falls at a 6.5 on a 1-10 scale.   

Decor is more like. Log-cabin with cute little black bears and the menu is designed as an old newspaper.    A nice creative touch.

A definite must on a rainy / cold / or stressful day as the comfort foods will warm your soul and make you feel better.

P.S.  The chicken soup is my favorite!!!"}
{"text":"This is a hard review....so lets just keep it simple.

Food--tasty, not overly warm.
Hot cocoa-- yummy to taste--a complete mess on the table!  Drippy mugs, sticky handles.
Service--fast and efficient and without an ounce of personality. 

I would go back -- I will just more aware of what to expect."}
{"text":"This little diner is amazing, starts with a newspaper style menu, then some reading material on the history of the chain of diners. Then we experienced some fresh coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice. The service was excellent from a lady by the name Marlene. The food was authentic and awesome. Would recommend to anyone that loves that small town diner feeling in a big city. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I love love love this restaurant. It has the feel of the Midwest without the big chain commotion. The atmosphere reminds me of going to breakfast with grandparents on a weekend visit away from mom and dad. Cozy, calm with the best wait staff around! The food is fantastic and the pricing is great especially considering the amount of food you're given. If you're new to the area or just want some good old fashioned cooking, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"I wait 30 mins to be seated 30 for them to take my order and 1 hour to bring me pancakes that were raw. When we brought it to their attention they said it would be discounted but no real apology was made. Never coming here again. Could have made better food at home, lesson learned."}
{"text":"As a relatively new resident of Gilbert, I am always looking for new places to try. Black bear diner caught my interest and finally came here on a Sunday during brunch hours. Not the best time of day to go (long wait) but we finally got in and seated. The décor is adorable. I love diners and this place has all the typical diner stuff and more! We started with a cherry bearclaw and wow was it tasty! Breakfast came with HUGE portions. Service was attentive and good.  As we went to the front to pay, the chocolate cream pie looked too good to pass up so I took one home for a dinner dessert. Pie was good served cold, not room temp.

I will definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"We love this place! They just opened right next to my house and it has been good both times. Surprisingly the under 500 calorie meals are so good and don't taste under 500 calories! Me and my Roomate had them and agreed :)"}
{"text":"The eggs benedict was delicious and the portions were very generous (we could have split a plate and still each left full).  Our server was extremely cheerful and you could see she genuinely enjoyed her job.  Totally worth the uber/lyft trip fare from the Strip."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in Henderson, Nevada. The service is fantastic, very attentive and friendly. Everyone makes you feel at home. I had a business breakfast meeting with several colleagues who ordered everything from the pancake stake, veggie omelette, scrambled eggs and sausage, all rounded off with hot chocolate with the biggest mound of whipped cream. The food portions were huge and everything tasted delicious. We also had s few sides of fresh fruit and the hash brown potatoes. I would definitely go back there again when I am in town!"}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast, great service and most importantly great coffee. I would highly recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place but lately it's gone down hill with the service. The portions are really big and the prices are reasonable but that's now pretty much it. I don't see the old wait staff..they all look new. I guess great service wasn't taught to this new group."}
{"text":"Stopped by on Thursday morning about 8:30AM for breakfast, was seated and drink order was taken, the waitress seemed in too much of a hurry and left halfway thru ordering drinks. She returned with only part of the drink order, dropped it off and went to the counter, sat down and was eating her breakfast, ten minutes later she returned to take our order, I told her of my dissappointment in the service and was told that she had been there since 5:00AM, my comment, in almost 40 years of working at the same place I always had breakfast on my own time before I got to work. Although the food was pretty good, cold when we got it because she was visiting with another waitress and guest while our food sat on the counter. I don't think I will ever return, a half mile down the street is TJ's, they always deliver good hot breakfasts from waitresses without attitudes."}
{"text":"Went this morning for breakfast ordered southern scrambler hash browns were completely burnt ruined my breakfast can't believe they would give that to a customer. Had to tell the waitress she returned with a better order. How can you serve burnt food to customers."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing.  Large portions well cooked.  The desserts are to die for!  Try the banana split pie!!!  The staff is friendly and upbeat.  They also do a great rib eye at a good price!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my Birthday breakfast this morning.  Johnathan provided excellent service, coffee and water kept full.  Meal served just as ordered."}
{"text":"When you have the choice between Denny's or Black Bear Diner, go with Black Bear Diner. The service is quicker and the food tastes so much better. Not to mention, the portions are big!

This place has a super homey vibe. I loved that they were playing oldies tunes from the 50s/60s. The entire staff was extremely friendly, too. We were greeted cheerfully when we came in, while we were there, and as we left. 

You can order breakfast any time, which is awesome. I love breakfast food. I ordered the cinnamon roll French toast, which was absolutely delicious. 

I'll definitely be coming back in the future!"}
{"text":"If you love Huge (really Huge) portions but don't really care about what it tastes like, if you don't mind standing and waiting for 1/2 hour for your table (and another 1/2 hour at table for your food), if you don't mind food strewn on the floor and an overall slightly dirty feel, if you have a large party with a bunch of crying babies, and if you don't mind if the waitress never checks on you and leaves dirty plates in front of you for 20 minutes -- then this is your place!!!!   I prefer good tasting food!"}
{"text":"To date, this is my favorite breakfast joint in the valley.  It's a little pricey, but you are getting great quality breakfast...  Best Best Best pancakes I've had anywhere.. or.. well, yea, anywhere..(I was thinking of Al Johnson for a moment in Door County, Wi, but those are actually sweedish pancakes)  Pass on the lunch, the burger I had was not amazing.  Nothing like the pancakes."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch this past weekend. The place has a real country/rustic feel to it with its fake wood columns and beams, wooden bear sculptures, and nature paintings. It's a cozy and comfy environment. The menus are kinda cool because they're designed like a newspaper with the food and drinks listed on the inside.

Come hungry because portions are big. I got the bacon bleu burger, a huge burger loaded with bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and bleu cheese with a massive pile of fries taking up every available square inch of the rest of the plate. It was really tasty and more than I could eat. My kid got some apple cinnamon french toast, which was cut in thin strips. He enjoyed it but it was a little too soggy for me when I tried it (I always stuff myself silly when we go out to eat because I eat my food and usually his food that he doesn't finish). He also liked all the stuffed teddy bears lined along the walls.

Service was friendly, but after we got our food we didn't see our waitress again until we flagged her down to get the check. It would have been nice to get a  refill on drinks.

I thought this might be locally owned, but it's a franchise. One of 42 locations throughout the west coast, Arizona, and Colorado. It's a pretty good place to go for lunch and their breakfast items looked appetizing. It's definitely worth another few visits. 

3.5 stars rounded up to 4."}
{"text":"What a great place for breakfast! BBD has a very warm, friendly, family feel to it. Cindi was our server and she is fantastic! She took the time to answer all our questions and never let my coffee cup go empty. The coffee by the way was delicious! The menu was on newspaper and there are stories also on it telling the (you are allowed to keep it) story of BBD and other stuff. Most of the food on the menu is made from scratch and it says you can customize your order any way that you like and if they can do it, they will.

I ordered from their \"little less\" menu which has smaller portions. It was still enough to fill me! For $6.99 I had 1 egg, 2 pieces of bacon, hash browns and sourdough toast. The egg was cooked just the way I ordered it, the bacon had great flavor, the hash browns were too tasty and the sourdough toast was great! Something simple as breakfast is easy to mess up, but they do it right here. I also ordered a \"Bear Claw\" priced at $4.49 however I was too stuffed from breakfast to tackle that big boy! Cindi packed it to-go for me and said to just pop it in the microwave for 25-30 seconds before I'm ready to eat it. She also said the bear claws are made at each location daily! That bear claw made for one mighty fine dessert :)

Lunch and dinner is also served here at BBD. I have no doubt it is probably tasty, but I'm sure this will me more of a breakfast spot for me since I enjoyed that so much."}
{"text":"Mouth watering.... I love this place. I want to eat here everyday!! Get the bacon... seriously. I always order French toast and bacon. I have got a few friends hooked on this place too. It's our go to!!"}
{"text":"Great people and great food.  It's true they do get overwhelmed at times but the waitresses are hard workers.  Don't listen to some of the fools leaving 1-star reviews because the food isn't 'progressive' enough for their superior tastebuds... reminds me of Gerald from South Park reading some of this crap.  Also, it's worth mentioning their bacon and OJ are amazing."}
{"text":"My BF and I went to Black Bear for the first time yesterday based on reviews I had read. The prices seemed just a bit high but every single bit of the the food was delicious. We tried the breakfast menu, but definitely want to go back for lunch or dinner.

I was in the mood to try a bit of everything, so I actually got 2 orders from the \"small\" section. A small cinnamon roll French toast, and a small combo plate with 1 egg, 1 sausage link, 1 biscut, and hash browns. It was so good that I ate everything except half the biscuit. And that was because I was simply out of room by them.

The only slightly problemic thing was that my BF ordered a large orange juice and what he got was more like a small or regular. And he had to ask the waiter for it twice. Yes, the juice was fresh-squeezed, but for $3+ we expected more."}
{"text":"Been there 5 times - twice for breakfast and 3 times for an early dinner.  Breakfast is packed but we have never waited and the food is great!  We have had the same server at night and she is amazing! I give a shout out to Toniann!  She makes our decision so easy on what to order and what options we have when ordering our dinner.  Went there last night and she was working, again. I am so impressed with her personality and the way she treats us.   Felt that I needed to take the time to compliment her and as they say \"give her the time of my day\" and recommend the restaurant and her."}
{"text":"It's great to have another great breakfast spot in the neighborhood! Keep up the good work guys.."}
{"text":"Here we are take 2 of coming to the new one with my soulmate. First experience bacon they served at dinner was from lunch. I was been offered Big Bear bucks that never came in the mail. So when my mom came to visit we came again then I told the manager that my big bear bus never came so she gave me  20 dollars in big bucks 2 that expire in 16 2 that expire in 2017. 

So coming in today very hungry took 5 minutes to even get a drink. And that was from somebody that wasn't even our server took our order without a pen and didn't even get it right. order wasnt taken for 10 minutes and  get my coffee , 30 minutes to find out that my food isn't even being cooked and now that it did it is rushed bread and sammich different temps and some nice grissle from the grill and no one is even come over to say we're really sorry about that your food's coming up right now. 40 mins now after writing this. Finally get my food. Thankfully I'm not allergic to tomato's that are hiding on my plate they left.  Fries are half old half 3rd degree burn in my mouth."}
{"text":"The wife and I wanted to try this place for the first time. So we planned on eating there. We walked in  and the host greeted us nicely and showed us our seats, but once we where sat down we ended up waiting 15-20 just for anyone to ask us for our drink order. I was about to leave until the waitress came up ( which she was super nice but boring) so she takes our order . We order our food I got the brazen chicken strip sandwich which was \"good\" my wife ordered the ceaser salad that was horrible over loaded with Realy runny dressing she couldn't even it , it mostly tasted of mayo. So that how my exsperence went :("}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy!
Everything we ordered was SCRUMPTIOUS!!! The Grizz is for the famished! SOOOO MUCH FOOD! I got the egg whites and veggies! Great too! Our waitress was very friendly and to food came quickly too. Loved the 1940's theme too. Menus were little newspapers! How cleaver. We're from Maryland. This was a great restaurant YELP! Thanks for the recommendation."}
{"text":"Came with a friend its a beary cute place to bear-down and grab some comfort food.  1st time here and I had to try the Blazin Bear with seasoned fries ...  OH so yummy.. I'm traveling from Burbank for this bite again.. Wanna try the breakfast too.. Will add to this experience with a Bears appetite.."}
{"text":"Everything was great, from the service to the food. I have had breakfast at Black Bear many times but this was my first time having dinner and it did not disappoint. Had the chicken fried steak and brought half of it home. The cornbread came out hot and was outstanding."}
{"text":"We have had breakfast and lunch while visiting Las Vegas here. The food was absolutely fabulous, the price was reasonable and I have never seen a restaurant so clean."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I need not say more!
Fresh OJ
Friendly staff 
A little bit of a wait to get a table but here on the south side we needed a good breakfast spot so this is a rare gem for us so the wait is understandable. 
My kids loved the kid menus. They have great games to keep them occupied."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recently remodeled and it looks great! The food is soooo delicious. Great, friendly service. Can't say enough about Black Bear and how good the food is. On this visit, I got the oatmeal and it was delish! The only drawback to this location is the crowded, small parking lot and the wait. Ugh! But, I guess that's because they're so wonderful."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and food. We ordered the volcano regular pancakes and it was amazing. The portion is huge though, so do make sure you have someone else to share this with."}
{"text":"After going all around phoenix trying to find the perfect breakfast spot and being disappointed, we decided to give this place a go and we're were every but disappointed!  The food was delicious and just like everyone else says.. the portions are HUGE! I had the cinnamon roll french toast and it was literally a cinnamon roll made into french toast! Like where in the heck has this place been all out lives! We found our go to spot for breakfast now."}
{"text":"My family and I are regulars at the location on Tropicana. The service is always wonderful and so is the food. 

Today, we decided to come to this location and we won't be back. The service was AWFUL. Our server was as quiet as a mouse, slow as all can be, and I tried ordering 2 different things and was told \"oh...we're out of that\". We asked for ranch dressing 3 times and it took her 15 minutes to bring it. Maybe I'm just used to the incredible service at the other location, but if this would have been my first visit, I would never be back at any Black Bear Diner again."}
{"text":"Please do not get me started on how obsessed I am with their biscuits. This place is PHENOMENAL. I came here with my mom after she went to the location in Big Bear. I have since fallen in love with the rustic ambiance and delicious food that Black Bear serves up. And their wait staff is amazing as well. It's such a great place to take the family!! Try the corn beef hash!! It's delicious!!"}
{"text":"First time here and love the food! It's our new spot for breakfast. Pancakes are awesome and portions are plentiful. We'll be back"}
{"text":"This is our F & L* at the Black Bear diner. Visited at 12:30 on a Saturday, fairly busy, waited a few minutes to be seated. Limited menu with breakfast, lunch and dinner available all day. I ordered the turkey plate and was disappointed. It came without dressing (stuffing) or cranberry sauce... come on, what's turkey without stuffing and cranberries? Two bites and I was looking for our server. Asked her to bring the plate back to the kitchen and have it microwaved since the items were cool. Offered to replace it but if it was not hot the first time I figured it wouldn't be hot the second time. Didn't really matter since the meal was not worth eating. I guess I'm not a fan of \"slab o' turkey\"; meat was sliced as thick as a pork chop. Lesson learned.
* First and Last"}
{"text":"I was pretty bummed when the Phoenix location closed.  You can always get a hearty breakfast here.  I like the spicy in-house sausage - biscuits and gravy on the side and you are talking my language."}
{"text":"On a recent trip I was able to go to two of these places 3 times.  This stop was pretty much like all the others. Chris the morning manager the day I went, was really on top of service, he got us seated right away, continually walked the floor and made sure people were taken care of and just overall assisting wherever needed.  Our waitress on the other hand could have been more involved.  She took our order and was barely around and was a little gruff when I asked about the selection of hot sauce and that whatever was on the table was all they had (which my other visits demonstrated there were still only proprietary sauces but there were a couple of choices).  Chris ended up getting a refill on my coffee and made sure we had the rest of what we needed, the only other time the waitress stopped by was to deliver the check.

For this location, I tried the California Benedict.  It was pretty good, the hollandaise worked well with the bacon and rest of the ingredients.  In future visits that will be a selection I try again.  Otherwise it was a quick in/quick out visit, but had Chris not closed the gap I would have ringed another star."}
{"text":"Poorly managed. Usually love black bear but this location needs help. Half of the tables were left sitting unattended full of dirty dishes with a line of people waiting to be seated. No manager to be seen. Never did see those tables cleared off after a 45 minute wait. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I had a hreat exporience with HECTOR NO MATTER WHAT HE TAKES THE TOME TO SAY HELLO
 And remembers us as guestbhere at this establishment
I would not want another waiter but hector
Thank you as always hector"}
{"text":"LOVE love LOVE this place for breakfast! The homemade sausage and chicken fried steak make this pregnant girl HAPPY! And do yourself a favor and ask for Bernard, he's an awesome, attentive server!"}
{"text":"Well, well, well......that was simply AMAZING!  
The husband and I showed up around 11ish on a Saturday morning, waited about 15-20 minutes and were sat and greeted rather promptly.  After review the menu I decided on the:
~Fresh fruit bowl (I shouldn't have ordered this because I know that NOTHING is truly in season yet......disappointment)
~A traditional bear claw (tasted like Greek baklava so the husband was in heaven!)  I'm glad that we tried it, I'm certain that it'll be something that he orders from now on! 
~PANCAKES........(sigh) they were so FANTASTIC!  I can't even begin to explain, wheat pancakes with a hint of almond extract, walnuts, and granola.  I topped them with butter, bananas and a touch of maple syrup.  SO AMAZING! 
~He got the Ruben and fries..........I didn't get a bite of the sandwich but the fries sure hit the spot!

~The place was PACKED so the service suffered just slightly.  Even still, we'll be back again in the very near future I'm sure!
:)"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast!  The place was really busy, so we placed a to go order and it was ready in 15min.  The pancakes were some of the best we have ever had."}
{"text":"The apple sausage and spinach egg white omelet was so good. And real fresh squeezed orange juice.  I'm in!! Definitely will return here"}
{"text":"Loved it here! Came here to try their chicken and waffles and was not disappointed! Server was friendly, service was fairly quick and the serving size was perfect for one person! 

I'm honestly surprised I've never heard of this place before considering how many locations there are. The environment is welcoming and the decor makes me  want to go camping lol"}
{"text":"This place is perfect if you're looking for a huge grossly satisfying breakfast! The burgers and sammiches are pretty great too but the breakfast takes it. 

Great country fried steak! 

Sometimes it's too much food, and I like that. The price is right too. 

It can get busy of course during the Saturday and Sunday rush but that's to be expected. 

I do wish the menus, tables and general surfaces were cleaner though. It does feel dirty and sticky in there often."}
{"text":"When you come to this place consider a few things: 

1. Don't eat all day.
2. Share one meal.
3. Be prepared to take home left overs.

Me and my friends came to place for brunch but we left with boxes with leftovers for dinner. The people were friendly and the service was quick. But I didn't anticipate the amount of food we received. We were only a party of 3 people and we had food enough for 8. I don't think I even put a dent on my own meal.

The food was delicious. The biscuits and gravy was the business. 

The place we went to was in Arizona but I heard there's a couple in the bay area. If you see one, I suggest stopping by with the troops and try it out."}
{"text":"If you like good old home cooking then look no further. I love this place. Huge servings so you get your moneys worth. Great chicken fried steak, pancakes, eggs, bear claws, meatloaf. I was going in for surgery and you never know what could happen, so this was my \"final meal\" chicken fried and sweet tea with mash potatoes  and an apple pie. So bad, yet so good. Definitely a splurge meal."}
{"text":"Previously I had gone here for lunch and just thought it was average.  The most recent time I went for breakfast and was much more satisfied.  

I ordered the thick-cut bacon & two eggs, which comes with hash browns (or country potatoes or fruit) and a biscuit.  The eggs were perfectly done. The hash browns had a bit of a buttery taste to them, which I'm not a fan of but it's nothing that would prevent me from getting them again.  The bacon had clearly been cooked and sitting for a while, but it was thick, crispy, and quite good nonetheless.  The biscuit is a bit of an oddball.  It's massive (about the size of 2-3 McDonalds biscuits) and looks more like a roll than a biscuit.  In fact, even the taste of it is somewhere between a roll and a biscuit, with a consistency similar to cornbread.  It was also room temperature, which is a big no-no.  I'll opt for the toast next time. 

The serving sizes were more than enough.  2 eggs felt like 3.  The potatoes were double the amount you would get at any other restaurant, the bacon slices were not only thicker than I've had at most places but very long, and the biscuit, as mentioned above, was huge.  For $7 it's quite a good deal.  They have even larger meals, some which come with three eggs and two biscuits for around $10.  Breakfast is served all day, by the way.

My server was attentive and service was actually too fast.  What I mean is instead of waiting 2 minutes for my food, I'd rather wait 5 if it meant I'd get fresh bacon and a warm biscuit.  Still, the amount of food you get for what you pay can't really be beat.  I think the owner or manager even made rounds saying hello to all the customers.  A nice touch.  On the strength of how good the breakfast and service was I'm likely to go back in the near future and sample some of their lunch/dinner fare again."}
{"text":"I was referred here by a friend who just loved it! I was immediately in love with the size of the place. Not too big and looked very diner-ish. Everyone was friendly and smiling. Our server was attentive and polite. She helped us choose our order but didn't tell us when me and my husband both ordered biscuits and gravy that one order would end child hunger. No joke. One order was mammoth much less us having two! The biscuits were not like a traditional biscuit. It was more like a large dinner roll. They were definitely not house made. 
The eggs and bacon were okay and as many have said the pancakes were the best part. Sweet due to the cream they add but heavy. Not like an ihop or Cracker Barrel cake for sure. I would say it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our first visit to Black Bear Diner. We headed there for Sat morning breakfast and was pleasantly surprised by the whole experience. First we were seated with no wait, even though the place was pretty busy. Our server was excellent, making us feel welcome and getting much needed coffee going while we looked over the comprehensive menu. 

Choosing the right breakfast was hard, but our waiter did a great job making suggestions and I went for the home made sausage patties breakfast. And I'm glad I did, the sausage patties are ridiculous!! Served with two eggs, potatoes and toast, this was a great breakfast to get the weekend started. My wife had pancakes and they were as good as you will get anywhere.

Pleasantly surprised, we'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I had the best Eggs Benedict I've ever had here. That have a great menu full of items I've never had but cannot wait to try. I've taken family and friends who have visited here and they all can't wait to go there again when they come back."}
{"text":"The food is good but they totally screwed up my order so bad twice they decided not to charge me. Waitress liked selling more than listening or executing even though I asked her twice for well done toast I got soggy cold bread. Asked her for ham and got bacon. Ended up eating cold eggs with no toast because it never came out. Expediter kept on asking for it. The expediter was excellent."}
{"text":"**Nice family spot**

Folks here are nice and friendly .. never ending sodas and lots of homemade foods, classic specials like burger and fries, HUGE egg omelets Stuffed with all you favorites, baby back ribs, meat loaf etc.  Good music on the juke box.  A++ for freshness, but  they lost a star on the banna cream pie crust (was not as flaky *hard and dry) -1 star for that one.... and kids eat free one day a week!!!!"}
{"text":"Great for breakfast.  The biscuits and gravy could not be finished.  The service was friendly and helpful.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been in Vegas since '05 and have never given this place a thought, although I had driven by it often. My girlfriends and I came here after a morning workout at the suggestion of our trainer.  The place is cutely decorated with stuffed bears all through out and a couple bear statutes before you even walk inside.  What I like about Black Bear is unlike Eggworks or Cracked Egg it wasn't as crowded and seating felt more comfortable and not as tight.  The menu had your basic breakfast items.  If you are trying to eat healthy they offer Fit and Focused Scrambles for under 500 calories,   And I don't know how healthy the 7-grain granola nut cakes are but they had an interesting nutty flavor to them and I like them better then regular pancakes.  They also offer sugar free syrup.  The waitress suggested the two stack for three of us and it was plenty to split.  Portions are very generous.  Service was good!  Never had to ask for coffee or water refills and the waitress."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite breakfast spot. It's delicious. The menu is huge (they serve lunch and dinner all day as well) and the service is great. We are always seated right away, and the wait staff are all very friendly and helpful (a little too friendly at times!). 
One of my favorites is the classic 2-egg dish with their homemade spicy sausage patties. The sausage is pretty spicy and super flavorful. Like, I crave it. So, so good. Their hash browns and home-potatoes are good, and we've never had an incorrect order (we've been there about 5 times or so). 
I also LOVE their California Benedict. The bacon is perfection and the hollandaise sauce is perfect for my taste. Simple, flavorful.
Did I mention their whole-grain pancake?!?! My favorite. The hubs prefers their sweet cream pancake. You can't go wrong either way. 
Now we need to get back for lunch or dinner so I can report back...:)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal at Black Bear Diner - I just had a chicken club sandwich and fries, but I thought their prices and their portion sizes were excellent and the food was very tasty. There's nothing super special about this diner, and there doesn't need to be. It just has good food at good prices in good (and probably too large) amounts. The service was pretty prompt and on top of anything we needed. 

My companion had a half sandwich and a chicken noodle soup combo. She didn't really like the soup as it had a bit of a sour flavor to it. I figure they add some kind of lemon or some veggies that add sourness but I wasn't sure why it was sour. However, her half sandwich was a good quantity and that combo was only seven dollars.

I didn't have enough room to try their dessert but I think I'll be back here when I'm in the mood for some diner food.

One thing that was a minus to me was the tables at the booths are tilted, as they are attached to the wall and sagging. It's not a huge problem but it is a tad awkward and it feels a bit run down because of that, and I didn't feel comfortable leaning on the table."}
{"text":"This is your typical dinner type of place. The portions are huge and the food is pretty good. This isn't a hipster place or fancy restaurant. This is a Denny's type dinner. Pancakes are awesome and you can't go wrong with any of the breakfast items. It's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Great service and food is awesome! Don sets the standard for local restaurants.
 We love the service and ambience. Thanks"}
{"text":"They went above and beyond!

I've been coming here with my wife for years, and she loved coming here with her family before that. The food is good, generous portions and reasonable prices, very good service and a nice atmosphere. It's a great place to go for breakfast or brunch. They even cook and shred their own corned beef for the hash!

But the other day, they went above and beyond. It was Christmas day, and my wife is pregnant with our second (it's a girl!). I was cooking a big dinner for everyone, and she really wanted creamed spinach. I had everything to make it except the spinach, and all the stores I tried were closed.

Finally I had a light bulb moment, crossed my fingers, and pulled into the Black Bear Diner parking lot. I went to the man up front, explained my situation, and asked if they would be able to sell me a bag of spinach. He helped a couple of other people who were waiting, then went back to the kitchen to see if they had enough to spare

A minute later out he walked, with about a 3-pound bag of spinach in his hand, and said \"call it $5?\" I gave him a twenty, headed back home, and now I've got more than enough brownie points to last me through the new year!

I'm so grateful to them all for helping me out, what a great thing to do. Last time I went to McDonald's a block away they refused to put a few french fries on my cheeseburger because \"we can't do that.\"

Anyway, I'm looking forward to my next visit there to sit down for a full meal, I'll make sure to ask for the manager and let them know the story. Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing service! Food was phenomenal. The manager Don made sure we were well taken care of. Our waitress Claudia was so sweet. We truly enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"Really good food + really good service = a great breakfast experience. :)  Found this place here on Yelp and was very pleased. There were 4 of us (and a baby.) and every one was very happy with their food. Large portions and tasted great!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've eaten at this diner, it had been a few years since my last visit and now I remember why I haven't been back TILL NOW... The husband was adamant about stopping here so we did! Now he regrets it! \" told you so\" 
Anyway... The young man that sat us down was friendly and brought our teas.. Our server (sorry missed her name) was just as friendly and took our orders.. I ordered the French dip (plain) and ff.. My other 1/2 orders the turkey burger tex mex  style.. My French dip was really dry, it's a good thing I had the a jus for dipping other wise I would've choked on it, maybe the loaded one wouldn't have been so dry.. The FF would have been awesome had they not over salted them with season salt .. I finished the FD since i had something to wet it down with!!
The husband ... Who normally cleans his plate, wasn't able to finish his turkey burger, the patty was super dry and very bland, the bun fell apart on the first bite, so he tried taking it apart to finish it but just couldn't get past the dull taste of turkey, his fries were just as bad as mine... Our server asked if there was something wrong with his meal since he barely ate 1/2 of it.. He mentioned it was too bland and dry, she actually agreed with him and offered something else, he declined but she insisted he take a free dessert  of his choice home to make up for his yucky dinner.. We thought that was really nice of her but it's just not enough to get us to return..
Nope ! Just not going there... Sorry Black Baar but this was a one way trip .."}
{"text":"There is one reason why I go here and one one reason only -- breakfast.  I love that I can get breakfast anytime of the day here.

I always get greedy and order a #4 and end up taking the rest home.

I have been known to deviate from my normal breakfast loving self and order their sandwiches and salads...all are out of this world in terms of proportion.  So much food for such a reasonable price!

Now I no longer have to drive all the way to Phoenix...this one is just down the street!"}
{"text":"In the never ending struggle to find a great breakfast place in the N. Valley we decided to check out this place. 

When you walk in your greeted by friendly staff and surrounded by\"bear motif\".   It's has a great diner feeling that is warm and welcoming.  It reminded me of a few places I had been when I lived in the NW.  

When you sit down the bear/diner motif continues.  There are some neat things they do with the table setting that makes the experience fun.  The menu appears to be a fold open newspaper from the 60's, the table setting has a bear print on the napkin and all of the sauces are made custom for this place.   All along there is a good mix of 60's-80's music playing in the background.  

Even though the menu was cool looking, it was a little overwhelming (seemed like there were 80 visible choices on the menu).  I ordered \"The Volcano\" with the almond multi-grain pancakes and a coffee.  The bacon and the pancakes were great, but the eggs were over cooked (ordered over-easy).  The coffee was regular diner coffee - nothing special.  The menu item was about $10.    

This place actually reminded me of \"The Place.\"  However, the cool ambiance and more tolerable noise level gave the Black Bear Diner a step up in my book.  

I'll probably be back to try something different."}
{"text":"I love Black Bear Diner.  Best big breakfast ever.  I am a huge breakfast fan and am incredibly fussy about quality, size and flavor.

This place always has it.  I love their thick cut bacon and yumalicious hash browns.

I've also eaten their salads, sandwiches and almost everything else on their menu.  I would recommend almost all of it.

Black Bear Diner used to be a small chain with only 5 restaurants stretching through California, Nevada, Washington and Oregon.  Now there are 15+ and it's made its way here to Arizona.  Some people don't like chains, but this chain is consistently good.  I've eaten at the locations in WA, OR, CA and NV -- always the same taste, quality and quantity each time.

It's casual and family friendly.  Parking is usually a lot, but on the rare occasion, street parking is mostly recommended.  I find it's usually connected to a hotel/motel.  Don't let that deter from the yumminess within.  :)

It's quite a drive from here in Mesa, but worth it."}
{"text":"Definitely a go to breakfast place for me, its close to where I live and I like their pancakes. They have the buttermilk taste and the added sweet cream makes them even better, I don't even need the syrup, good to go right from the start. I have had many of their other options and always on point. Very friendly staff and they provide excellent service. It can get busy on the weekends as most LV breakfast places do but it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Sunday Breakfast in Vegas = long lines. After a few hot spots proved this theory true we drove across town. Just a 15 min wait we were taken to our seat by an older gentleman who was busy greeting people and talking to patrons who were leaving, a very friendly person. My food was very good. A wide variety of lunch and breakfast items with large or small portion options. Service was a bit slow but it was busy."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast out of curiousity and yelper's reviews.
I ordered The Grizz, and wifey ordered the Gobbler. We also ordered a short stack of the sweet cream pancakes which alot of people rave about.
The grizz was okay, But the gobbler wasn't all that. Niether were the pancakes. Can you say IMITATION VANILLA EXTRACT OVERKILL????

Sorry, but the best pancakes in town still belong to DuPars and a close second to Blueberry Hill IMO. Du Pars is still my go to spot...ALOHA!!!!"}
{"text":"We did not enjoy our experience, at least our food experience, at this diner.  We ordered what was suggested to us, as it was our first time there.  The tomato soup was delicious.  We should have stopped there. Instead, we also ordered entrees, which though well portioned (i.e., huge sizes), made us feel ill and indigested.  NO, we did not eat it all.  We took half to go, but felt so queasy after the meal, that we threw the rest out.  It could be that they need to change the oil in the kitchen, or we just got a bad batch of this sampler plate.  But either way, it soured (literally) our taste for this restaurant.

On a plus side, we found the hostess quite friendly, and the server staff attentive."}
{"text":"Average food and average pricing.   I would rate it just below the egg and I.  Probably better pricing.  Nothing special but the neighborhood needed something in that old Chilis space so I'm happy something is there."}
{"text":"I had the meat loaf with mashed taters and gravy. It came with vegetables, soup or salad, and a delicious corn bread muffin. My wife had the chicken fried steak with country gravy, also delicious.  We shared the blackberry cobbler with vanilla ice cream for dessert, Devine! The service is very welcoming, our server Renee was great! We will definitely be back, looking forward to trying the fried chicken."}
{"text":"The food was good but the reason for the 5 stars was the excellent service. Our waitress Monique is by far one of the best waitresses we've ever had. She welcomed herself  introduced herself and shared her suggestions on the menu. She was very attentive and came by often with refills and anticipated our needs. This place should feel very happy and lucky to have Monique represent them. She is an asset and should receive recognition. Thank you for starting our first meal on vacation such a memorable and enjoyable experience. 

Date of visit: 6/9/17 at 11am."}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast experience at Black Bear Diner. The corned beef hash was probably the best I've ever had. The manager greeted guests at the door and made everyone feel at home."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everyone is so nice and they really know about good teamwork. It's like you're transported out of Vegas to a small town with the nicest people ever. No joke. 

The waitress was attentive and always came by with a smile. Even the hostess came by to make sure we were enjoying our meal. You just don't get customer service like this anywhere else. Absolutely amazing. 

And the food?! Yummy! Probably some of the best chicken pot pie I've ever had. Nice puffy pastry crust, fresh veggies, and hearty. Simply perfect. Also had to try my husband's chicken fried steak and it was great. Perfectly fried, tender, and smothered in delicious gravy. 

Yep. Our bellies are full and there's a smile on our faces. Love this place. They know about great customer service and good food."}
{"text":"Me and my wife ate here this morning and had the Grizz. We were highly disappointed because of a reheated red country potatoes. The potatoes were lukewarm and mushy overcooked. The waiter apologized and replaced it with hashbrown potatoes that seemed reheated and lukewarm as well. I think the cook tried to do shortcuts and recycled those products. We've been here a few times before and never had problems with their food until now. I called the manager in the afternoon and mentioned our disappointment- and of course he apologized."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our meal for brunch with my Son!  Friendly waitress and was seated very fast! Awesome food and service."}
{"text":"Lack of service is a serious issue at this location. I have been to the Tropicana one many times and have never received the kind of service I did today at this location. 

A male server asked what I would like to drink promptly when I sat down. That's when the good service ended. The drink didn't come until the same server walked around again and saw I didn't have my water. 

I asked for Tabasco sauce to a female server and she never brought it to my table. After some time,  I had to flag down another female server. 

My friend asked for a cup of coffee during her meal to a female server. She came by and set the coffee down not asking if she wanted creamer since only sugar is on the table. So another female server had to be flagged down to request cream. 

No server ever came around asking if everything was okay or if we needed anything or offering refills of our beverages until my water glass was completely empty at the end of my meal.  Then the male server brought me another water. 

During our entire breakfast we interacted with 3 different servers. None of them  offered additional service unless we requested something and all of them looked miserable and clearly offered no smiles to customers. 

It's unfortunate because the food was good. However, we won't be back to this location because just having good food is only half of the dining experience!"}
{"text":"Every time I walk inside Black Bear Diner on Trop and Jones I feel like I'm in a small town. 

If your looking for fancy and chic Sunday brunch, this is NOT the spot. This is family, relaxed, down home, and comfort all the way! Hence, I tend to come more during the winter months. 

FOOD: 
Traditional American breakfast diner, I must say that this particular BB makes exceptional biscuits and gravy, so this is one of my must when I do stop by...
Other nice dishes are: corned beef hash, steak and eggs, as well as the traditional pancakes, bacon and sausage. I love their Acapulco omelet, I try to eat healthy for the most part and it's both healthy and delicious (egg whites, veggies, and avocado). I'm a big fan of their pancakes and waffles the batter reminds me of waffle house down South! 
Every single dish isn't a home run, but most everything I've tried is solid. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE: 
Staff is always friendly and welcoming, and of course attentive. I've never had an issue with a meal, and I love that they let you customize your meal more or less and LISTEN. I'm most impressed that even under busy and hectic days like Sundays they don't make you feel rushed. 

The only true con here is the wait time on certain days in my opinion."}
{"text":"Not much to say!  It was comparable to Dennys, maybe a little better, but more expensive! The pot roast looked pretty good as it passed our table.  If I return I might try it."}
{"text":"4 stars SERVER FLOWER DESERVES 5 STARS.  wonderful fast friendly efficient service... great job. .  Wasn't pleased with my sandwich and quickly replaced it.  Food 3.5 stars potpie, ruben, tri tip san.  Ok, beef dry, rest good, fries hot n crispy.    Been here many many times."}
{"text":"Cold, stale biscuit, almost raw sausage and food nothing like menu pictures on line. No reason to return! Back to Blueberry Hill for us!"}
{"text":"Hostess didn't seat us right away but kept taking payments when there are tables available. Food was bland. Waitress was very sweet and that's about the only good thing about this place."}
{"text":"I went in to the LV location back in March and I have not been back... A place I once frequented, now is on my \"no go\" list.  The place was half full and it took 20 minutes for our server to come take our order, food came out in an timely manner, but wasn't  cooked right, I asked for rare, got done-done steak. Our server kept showing her tattoos to the group next to us which I could swear, they didn't ask to see. Also, she was inappropriate with her stories of her private life. I don't mind small talk, but there is a limit.  I was also giving my toddler little bits of veggies and he had pulled the paper place mat off the table and I placed some food on the table which he smashed up on the table. So, I took a napkin and wiped up the mess, as I folded it back onto itself, the dirt that came up with the food... I was appalled. I should have talked to management, but I gathered my family and we left. i hope that they have cleaned the place by now, but I'll stick to going to the California locations they seem to be clean."}
{"text":"Thank You for Ruining Breakfast-

Had to stop after my first bite to review this place and write my experience. Let me just note that I KNOW there are people who would say to \"suck it up\"; I'm sure the owners or management roll their eyes when people complain about \"little things\" but $40 for ONE Breakfast and some chicken strips is not a small thing for a middle class person. It's a LUXURY and having it ruined is absolutely unfair and very poor business practice. 

I ordered a veggie omelette withOUT peppers not because I'm a picky eater, far from it, but because bell peppers are ONE produce I do not like in my eggs! My omelette was STUFFED with bell peppers. I'm pretty sure when the check out girl opened the container to confirm no bell peppers, she saw them because she twitched but still said \"... and no peppers\" Thanks, for being deceitful and wasting my $10. I certainly did not have a fork to cut into with and see all the peppers. I'm not going to eat this. I hate the lingering smell of peppers in my eggs and they give me heartburn. GODDAMNIT!! 

I ordered a side of home fries or country potatoes or whatever. Almost completely raw. Nothing else to be said here.  

I ordered chicken strips with fries for $9. The chicken strips were extremely small, surprising even. But that's not the worst part: they were OLD. Clearly fried a while earlier and sat under a heat lamp. The batter is rock hard and completely falls off the chicken, exposing dry, yellow meat. The bits are so hard, it's almost impossible to eat. Thank you for giving me old food for my money. 

Pancakes -- decent but clearly made with packaged or pre bought liquid batter because I can taste all the fake ingredients in it. 

BACON. Yeees, I order a side of bacon. First, the check out girl opens the container to show me and then bacon rolls out on the register counter. She gasps but clearly wished I didn't see that. I asked her to put it back in and request crispy bacon plus an extra order. This one was merely seared and it still looked... alive . I waited, literally for 18 minutes for a new batch. I asked TWICE wtf is going on and can I get this precooked bacon. Finally another girl hands me a container. I look. SAME FUCKING CONTAINER WITH SAME BACON and no additional order like I paid for. I send it back and tell her I'm standing there literally WAITING for that to be fixed and remind her of the extra order. About 6 minutes later she brings it. 

I will absolutely not ever order here again. Every single experience I wanted to have today was ruined and is INEDIBLE for me. 

You're welcome to contact me and let me know how you would like to issue me my refund. 

Never. Again."}
{"text":"It's nice to have new restaurants in this part of Chandler.  The decor is great and they serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner all day.  Service or kitchen made the time from ordering to serving slow.  It was a Friday lunch, but it was not a capacity crowd.  My daughter loved her kids chicken strips, but my 1/3 lb bacon cheddar burger was average.  Chargrilling would up to an excellent burger.  My coconut cream pie was a lot of whipped cream, vanilla pudding, and a crust.  The coconut was on top. Disappointed! I gave it 3 stars because it's acceptable, but I think my first visit is my last one."}
{"text":"Typical diner food. The taste is pretty good, the prices are not too bad, but the portion sizes are Gigantic. The staff is friendly and very attentive but come for breakfast and be prepared to wait up to 30min for a seat even longer on Sundays. 
Favorite thing to get here is the grizz. Its a humongous lumberjack sized meal that blows away other breakfast platters. Also great is the Volcano breakfast plate.
For lunch the turkey bacon avocado sandwich is delicious. Definitely a place to stop by if your nearby and hungry."}
{"text":"Left Dennys bad service at 7th Street and Camelback. Took the drive to Black Bear. Not on our route, but you can't beat the service !"}
{"text":"Food is always consistently yummy. The wait staff is very friendly.  It would be nice if they redid their seating.  The booth seats are not comfy."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a truck stop on a road trip up North. Friendly service, ginormous portions.  Probably the biggest biscuit I've ever seen in my life.  I had the chicken sausage scramble which was good and filling..since I chose something on the \"light\" menu I wish they hadn't buttered my toast in advance. I had a taste of the chicken fried steak and it was good but there is no way on God's green earth that I'd ever be able to finish that meal."}
{"text":"I eat here every time I come to Las Vegas. The food is great, the portions are large and the staff very friendly. It is good for breakfast lunch and dinner"}
{"text":"I tried it twice.  The first time the service was terrible and the air conditioning was so cold you could not eat comfortably.  Asked to have the air conditioner lowered it was not the service was slow and awful.   But the food was ok and plentiful. The second time was during the winter and guess what there was no heat and it was cold again.  The service was still slow and terrible.  Now the food was bad and old.  I will not wait  for the third strike.  Too bad sHARIS CLOSED."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here two days in a row. It's really good. The pancakes are like no other. I usually douse my pancakes in syrup cause they're always dry but not here! The pancakes were amazing. 
The service is great too. The second you sit down they are ready for a drink order. Less than 5 mins later, you have your drink and they're ready for your order. Less than 15 mins later you're eating like a queen or king. Go check this place out if you are in the Las Vegas area!"}
{"text":"They serve real Corned Beef Hash! Service Is great... quick... homemade pies... nice atmosphere ..."}
{"text":"Very slow service. Extremely loud. Plates were stacked on top of each other while waiting to be taken out to the customers. Will probably not be back."}
{"text":"First time eating here- I was impressed the restaurant had a big menu, not overwhelming though.  Breakfast anytime of the day!  I am loving that there are options for eating \"less\" if you are not super hungry.  Portions are huge!  I ordered the meatloaf/mashed potatoes, it came with corn on the cob and a choice of soup or salad.  I chose the salad with bacon ranch dressing- very large portion!  All servers were on point, so friendly and informative.  My husband was stuffed full after ordering the pot roast.  My kids ordered off the kids menu which was a perfect portion and came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream with sprinkles.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for breakfast this morning.  Place was not very busy around 7AM.  I got the special posted for the day consisting of 3 eggs, 1 each bacon ham sausage, hash browns (or home fries), toast (or biscuit).  Total with decaf and tax came to $9.83.

Good points:
I like the decor, especially the color scheme.
There was plenty of food for the price.
Josh gave me excellent service, most of the time.
There was not a long wait for the food and it was all hot.

Stuff that could use some work:
While Josh directly gave all his customers great service I do not think the whole dining room needed to know about the steak that was served way over done or what mess the closing shift left him, He should be a bit more discreet talking to the rest of the staff rather than shouting.
I was drinking decaf and there was no marker under the cup so the other waiter almost added regular coffee to my cup.

Overall it was an OK place to go."}
{"text":"Went for the first time this evening.  Restaurant was fairly empty, seated quickly and we noticed a very clean and cute, decorated place.  Joslyn was our server and she was pleasant and very efficient.  We ordered the pot roast dinner with salad and blue cheese dressing, the smaller portion of the meatloaf, both had mashed potatoes sans gravy and I had the \"Italian\" green beans and partner had the corn on the cob.  

Salad came and it was a great salad...fresh mixed greens with grated carrots and the dressing was wonderful.  Great experience thus far.  Then came dinner...the meat loaf was horrible; over cooked, dry, and just a very weird texture.  The pot roast was ok...no sauce (ok I did say no gravy for the potatoes).  The meat was tender but really had no flavor; I used some steak sauce to give it flavor.  The mashed potatoes were great!  They had red skins and were kept chunky and we really liked them.  The green beans were horrible!  They were not \"Italian\" style...they were your typical Del Monte canned green beans and they were swimming in a small little bowl with a ton of over cooked, placid looking bacon.  The corn muffins that came with the salad were tasty; sweet and corn tasting.  

Joslyn noticed that partner didn't eat meatloaf and asked about that...she ended up taking the entire meal off the bill.  She didn't have to do that and I made sure her tip was what she would have gotten had we paid for the full meal.  She did a great job and we told her we would come back and try breakfast...she raved about the pancakes so we'll be back to give them a try.  Dinner?  Never again, thank you.     

Two stars for the salad, dressing, muffins, mashed potatoes, and server experience!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a convenient location near the mall on South Las Vegas Blvd. All the employees are very nice. They offer the full menu all day long. I went for dinner and ordered the pot roast. It was delicious, so I came back a few days later to get a cheeseburger for lunch. I was expecting an amazing burger, but what came was a few notches below your typical one paddy In-N-Out burger. It was small and typical: nothing special. I did not think the fries were all that great either. A few days later I came for breakfast. I ordered bacon and eggs. It was excellent. In just three visits, I've seen the good and the bad. This place is known for big, American sized portions of food. It's mostly comfort food. If you're into that type of thing, you might like what they do there. However, if you're not a fan of big plate loads of food, you should try somewhere else. I give a thumbs up for breakfast and a so-so rating for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Ordered the bbq western burger and that was good! Great food good portions. The service was quick and friendly.  Will come here again."}
{"text":"I am a new Phoenician and so I decided to try this place on a friends recommendation. I must say that unlike many other reviewers I am still on the fence after 3 visits. I want to like this place... Kinda like how lots of people are into sports.. I can take this place or leave it. 

Positives:

1. Portions are big. Real big. If you order some of their \"large\" breakfasts you are in for an epic size. 

2. Service is normally good even when it's busy. The servers incidentally look like they are undercover roller derby girls. Cute!

So anyways I ordered some huge hamburger the first time. I pictured some yummy burger served up the way that only little chain places do. Dry bun, no cheese, not flavorful. Swing and a miss. :( the next time I went I ordered more traditional breakfast fare and that was.. Ok. I had an ice cream sundae with their custom flavors.. Boo! Big hunk of ice in the ice cream, huckleberry, their custom chocolate and yea. Strike two! I felt bad when the derby girl asked me how I liked the sundae she made for me. She told me it was so pretty that she almost kept it. Had to bite my tongue there lol. 

On the other hand there was a pretty solid breakfast the last time. Their crown jewel are their sweet cream pancakes. They charge too much, but these ain't no Krusteaz... Light, sweet, delicious, yum!

So in closing... This place has not won my heart but I won't say no either."}
{"text":"Thomas W gives excellent service and truly makes Sunday's great thank you for that !  My family and I have visited a few Black Bear Dinners from up north in Shasta to Portland Oregon and Hillsboro Or and it's always family friendly and we love it"}
{"text":"Great breakfast experience there. The food is amazing just as the service. The chicken apple sausage was just amazing as well as there pancakes. Wish I would have had the biscuits and gravy because everyone seemed to rave about them but just hit my food limit so definitely a next time experience. If visiting Arizona like I am I suggest this place for sure!"}
{"text":"I had the huevos rancheros benedict. The first thing I expect when I stab a poached egg is a runny yolk. Both of mine were near hard-boiled. The hash browns were extremely bland and also undercooked. I've had better biscuits at KFC. They just missed the mark everywhere."}
{"text":"My husband got a breakfast burrito it was okay, wouldn't order it again. I on the other hand got the Chicken Fried Steak and everything was delicious, the steak, eggs, hash brown and you must get biscuit. Oh and don't forget to join their e club to get a free coffee and huge bear claw. It's not too far from the strip :)."}
{"text":"I love love this place. Great food at a great price. The trip away from the strip was worth it. One of my favorite breakfast stops in vegas."}
{"text":"Ok first I wouldn't consider this place a diner, it probably seats 180+, it's a restaurant. Just wanted a simple diner breakfast, eggs,HB,sausage biscuits and gravy. I received my order in about 2 minutes probably because it was already made. It was lukewarm and mostly bland. There just wasn't anything that would make me want to return."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! BIG PORTIONS for reasonable prices! I'm a breakfast person but even their sandwiches are great. I would highly RECOMMEND this place over IHOP or Dennys."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been eating at this location for over a year. Every time we come in, we get great service. They have WONDERFUL oatmeal, but they don't serve it later than like 2pm I think or when it's gone it's gone for the day. So if they have it, give it a try. The chicken fried steak is also DELICIOUS. They have great steaks and I really love their chorizo scrambler.

To be honest, I have never been disappointed with anything we've ever ordered from Black Bear. They have good portion sizes, but watch out for their sundaes: they are HUGE and AMAZING {so save room if you are planning to have a sweet finish to your meal}.

I highly recommend Black Bear to anyone who loves some good 'ol comfort food."}
{"text":"Only have been here to get their pies to go for a pot luck.  The pies were mouth watering...  SO GOOD!  Need to come back to try the food."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in for lunch at this location on a recent Saturday. There was no wait and it was busy but not crowded. However, we were seated at the dreaded \"no one's table\" which is that table that none of the wait staff believe is their responsibility. Finally flagged down a waitress who agreed to take care of us. Only, she didn't. She placed our order, then ignored us, spending quite a bit of time chatting with a customer seated at another table, never once glancing up so I could get her attention. I finally flagged down another waitress as she zipped by, who very kindly said she would check for us and the food did then  finally appear. And, in my opinion, it was just OK but nothing special. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great place to bring kids to eat, ice cream comes with meal. Good comfort food. Close to home family loves it."}
{"text":"Use to love this place. Had not been in years, ordered their southern bowl for take out and received the hardest biscuit, very little gravy and tasted like yesterdays food. I called in immediately and would not be writing this if manager would of helped. All I wanted was my $10 refunded but she would not since I used a debit card but Hey I could get Bear Bucks. I hate to try and be forced to retry a place if they gave me bad food first time. This should be a choice not a must to get any kind of relief from bad overcooked food"}
{"text":"We ate here for dinner late. Had the meatloaf & chicken pot pie. Pot pie was great. You will need to wait longer for it as they do a great pastry on top & made to order. Meatloaf was tender and tasted more like salisbury steak with gravy."}
{"text":"The food was alright... The service was ok.  I would go back if I was in the area, but it's not so good that I'd go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"My parents went there for lunch today. Mom sent me a pic of her taco salad and it was quite impressive. Their service was top notch."}
{"text":"So i went here for the 1st time a few weeks ago.

Wow I have been missing out big time...

This place is fantastic! It was hard to choose what I wanted to eat because there were so many tempting items. I got the Bigfoot Chicken fried steak and it comes with soup or salad and a corn bread muffin I chose a salad with ranch which I must say was very tasty ranch and the muffin was so sweet and soft. You also get a choice of sides I  ordered the red skinned mashed potatoes and baked beans let me tell you I have never had baked beans that good they were sweet and spicy and had sausage and bacon in them mmm mmm good. Now on to the main dish the chicken fried steak it was tasty fried goodness covered in homemade gravy the meat was very good quality this is definitely the best chicken fried steak I have ever had.

Not only was the food absolutely delicious but the service was excellent and the price was right.

I cant wait to return to this restaurant there are so many other delicious looking items I wanna try."}
{"text":"Ive been here only once and it was great. We had good service and the food was great. It is packed on Sunday mornings so expect a long wait."}
{"text":"Let me start off with I understand that it is Father's Day. Walked in to Black Bear Diner and asked the wait for 2 was. I was told 15-20 minutes. After waiting for a half hour and watching several parties that came in after us be seated I asked when we would be seated. I was told there were 5 parties ahead of me and it would be 25 minutes. So 15-20 minutes was now going to turn in to 55 minutes. While others were seated ahead of us. I would to add that when my name was added to the wait list there were approximately 7 names total ahead if us. Interesting there were still 5 ahead of us when at least 6 parties had been seated!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and i have to say this place is busy (Las Vegas Blvd. Location). My mom and me decided on lunch items. A ruben on rye and a chicken avocado bacon club. Not too bad the ruben was a bit salty/sour but serving portion is large here. My chicken avocado club was tasty and also very big in portion. I would definitely recommend this place to try. I can't wait to come back and try their breakfast items. Everyone around us that ordered breakfast food looked amazing. And they have a very large selection from breakfast to dinner dishes. Oh and the desserts looked amazing as well but unfortunately we left no room on this trip to try... For sure next time."}
{"text":"I noticed not so wonderful ratings here, decided to try it anyway. My wife and I each had an awesome breakfast in a very pleasant atmosphere, and the service and courtesy couldn't have been better. No offense to negative reviewers, but I didn't find a single flaw!"}
{"text":"Came across this diner when meeting a friend for breakfast. Absolutely surprised on how good the service was. Seems good service is on the decline in Vegas but this place was top notch. My coffee cup was never empty and our server (unfortunately I don't remember her name) was so sweet and attentive. Everyone at the restaurant was very pleasant. The food portions are huge. I got the basic egg breakfast and everything was delicious. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, great breakfast, this seems to be a chain restaurant and i'm assuming every location is amazing. the sweet cakes were delicious, the service was great, the chicken sausage was very very good, service was fast, they were very kind and a great experience. If you enjoy delicious plays on traditional american breakfast, you will love this restaurant and location!"}
{"text":"Took my family to eat here for the first time. The staff was friendly and efficient.  The food was awesome!  They give you huge portions so you might want to consider sharing with a friend.  Their desserts are wonderful!  Everything was fresh and made to order. We really liked the \"diner\" vibe. Their seating (even at the counter) is wheelchair accessible.  The prices are lower than I expected.  We will definitely come back often!"}
{"text":"I love this diner...I tried their Ruben sandwich, garlic fries, freshly squeezed orange juice and bread pudding...I prefer to go there when it is not crowded, the service and quality of food is better...!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had the pleasure of dining at the Black Bear Diner this evening. My husband has the NY steak cooked medium exactly as he ordered it. I had the small portion meatloaf with fruit and it was moist and perfectly seasoned. 
Amanda was our lovely server. She greeted us with a warm smile and was able to answer all my questions about the menu items. She brought every course of our meal in a timely manner, had a fantastic personality, and made us feel right at home. 
We will be returning, and I hope Amanda is there as we will be requesting her for our server."}
{"text":"First time visiting and had always wanted to try it. Will not go back, at least not for breakfast. Let's start off by saying the service was good, but the food wasn't so much. I had the Griz breakfast. Ordered it with the hash browns and got the country potatoes instead. Our waitress immediately had it corrected. However, both potatoes lacked flavor or seasoning.
The ham chunk was pretty salty, but then the bacon was ridiculously salty and the sausage was mushy texture, fatty and too much sage for my taste. The eggs ordered over medium were ok and more towards over easy, but that's ok. Oh, and then the pancakes. Well, I thought they were ok, but a bit sweet, but my wife thought they tasted too much like cake batter, and they kinda did, like sweet cream or cake batter ice cream. I'm sure that's the way they supposed to be, since they were sweet cream pancakes, but maybe a bit too rich. 
I'm a coffee snob and sold coffee commercially for many years, and I would just say their coffee was mediocre. For a place like this, they should have distinguishable coffee with a unique flavor note.
In the end, I wasn't able to choke down the sausage, bacon or too much of the ham and hash browns. Overall, just not that great as I was hoping for better."}
{"text":"Very cute decor.  It felt like something that should be located in the Redwood National Forest.  And can I say I appreciate a chain that doesn't feel like a chain.  Good job.

We ordered breakfast food but the lunch foods looked delectable.  Eggs and Pancakes were eggs and pancakes.  Nothing to complain about nothing to write home about.  I was mostly impressed though with the meat.  The sausage links had a great flavor and texture and the bacon was thick and smoky.  LOVED the bacon."}
{"text":"We were staying on the Las Vegas Strip, a place I hate for its overpriced, mediocre food. I asked a local where to find a good diner for breakfast off the Strip and he suggested this place. We took a city bus over and loved it at first sight. The food and service did not disappoint either. I had the chorizo scramble and relished every bite. My son said the pancakes were the best he ever had, and he's had a lot. The fresh-squeezed orange juice was tangy and sweet.  It feel so good to be out of the circus of the Strip and have some good, homey food. I wish we had a Black Bear Diner where we live!"}
{"text":"For starters, a huge thank you to servers Melissa and Ryan on dinner shift for their exceptional customer service.  Although the food is tops, the service is what makes the experience top-notch. Melissa and Ryan made a great impression from the first visit.  Thank you also to Corey the manager for making us feel welcome.

This is hands down my favorite location.  It's a little more spacious, has diner bar seating, and the employees just seem happier.  The food quality and plating seems better here too. I love the variety on Black Bear's menu and the ability to get breakfast food any time or the \"little less bear\" or what I call the \"small bear\" portions as the regular portions are hearty. 

If you're looking for casual, budget friendly dining with a super welcoming atmosphere and great service, then this is your place."}
{"text":"The Black Bear Diner chain just lost four customers and all of our military and veteran friends.  It really pains me to give any Black Bear Diner such a low rating, but they can thank the male manager on duty during the morning shift on 2/24/18 for taking what would have been a solid three stars to one star and for losing ALL of my future business.  I love the Tropicana location.  The Sahara location is one of my favorites.   I've never had an issue until this visit. Black Bear was always on the top of my recommendation list for my out of town guests.

Short version - Manager wanted to argue over 10% military/veteran discount and told me he will make sure that he tells all of the Las Vegas Valley stores to stop providing such discount.  His reasons for not wanting to provide it were ridiculous and some are provided below.  

This location is always very busy, especially on the weekends.  There were four of us (two military veterans and spouses) and the wait was not terrible.  We were seated within 15 minutes and had a great server named Yessenia take care of our table.  She did a fantastic job and took care of all our needs efficiently.

The food was ok.  A little flavorless compared to the other locations, but not unsatisfactory.

The problem started when the check came.  I had just visited the Sahara location on 2/18 with my husband who always inquires about a military/veteran discount.  We try to patronize the places that do so and encourage our veteran and military friends to do the same. Often times we kick the difference back to our server on top of what the full price tip would be when we get good service.  The Sahara location gladly offered it to us and stated it is 10%.  Our dining companions also made note that they have received a discount at locations in Utah, Oregon, and California.

When our table asked, we were told no by the person who brought the check, who was not our server.  When our friend asked for them to double check, we then proceeded to wait another 10 minutes and no one came back.  I took the check up to the cashier and asked again and was told she didn't know.  I asked to speak to the manager.

The manager said that Black Bear does not offer a discount to anyone.  I told him I was at the Sahara store less than a week ago and there was a veteran discount.I explained that we got good service and it would allow me to tip extra to Yessenia.  Our friends also expressed that they have received the same discount at all other locations.  This started out benign but then he claimed the following:

- No one in the chain does it. Ever.
- But then claimed he gives \"them\" (other stores?) leeway to do so based on location.  Or if they feel they should give it to the veteran.
- He says if they are close to a base they can do it.  Then tells me that he allows it in St. George, UT and Layton, UT.    Last time I checked, Nellis AFB is here and a hell of a lot closer than St. George.
- He said he would make sure he lets \"all of his stores here\" know to stop offering it.

I told him that I'd be glad to let all of our military and veteran friends know to stop visiting.   He begrudgingly gave me the 10% off which I did indeed tip back to our great server.  I hope she sees this and considers finding a better work environment because her manager's attitude could definitely cut into her money.  I hope Black Bear Diner will also see this and check into what is happening in their stores.  I also hope the young soldier who was less than 10 feet away from the cashier stand heard this and decided to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"So happy to have found the new location on Alma School. I am from Northern CA, so this is a little bit of food for my soul. Love their breakfast menu, but love everything really!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Another breakfast spot! Breakfast places are hard to find you know. It has the Denny's concept, but with a more mountain and forest kick to their personality. Less of the Denny's corporate ingenuity, and more of a homemade personal appeal. Leaning towards the Original Pancake House feel.

They're famous for the cinammon rolls and they are the size of a human's head. So please believe you can lose your fork digging in that thing. Another thing that's homemade is their buttermilk biscuits and their fresh orange juice. 

I tried the tri tip scramble which was meaty and delish! I'm a meat lover, and so I had to have meat as part of my five food group. The portions are huge and the scramble definitely had flavor thanks to the tri tip and the onions. 

It is a mom and pop diner so if you're looking for a spot to check out some babes after a night out of town, this may not be the spot for you unless you're looking to snag a 65 year old retired cougar. RAWR. Senior Citizen Central! Also, eyes will wonder and whispers will lurk if you're looking like you had a horrible night out of town since it is also a family environment."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast after reading about it on Yelp. Our experience was very good. I got the corned beef hash and it was excellent, with real corned beef. Hashed browns were made with real potatoes. The wife got chorizo scrambled eggs and loved it. The biscuits were really good also, nice and light and not too dense or heavy. The portions are huge so this place is a great deal. This place is the real thing, using local food of high quality. We definitely would return."}
{"text":"I had a not so good experience with Black Bear, however, the Management and their staff did everything in their power to make things right and they did.  

I want to thank them for a wonder experience on yesterday. My business partners and I had a wonderful dinner, service was excellent and the food was amazing. We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to eating here, brought my family to eat with my Christmas bonus and am extremely disappointed..... Food was SO bland, service was terrible and I will not be back. The review from an hour ago on the same day had even worse service."}
{"text":"I am a meat and potatoes kind've girl. I decided to try the previously recommended (yelpers) Fried chicken steak and mash with gravy,.
I didn't like their gravy at all. It was a white gravy but really bland, the thought makes my stomach weak. Since their was gravy on my mash and my fried chicken steak, the meal was not good at all. 

My friends love their breakfast foods (ie. pancakes).

Hmm, well their coffee was cool. 

Needless to say I didn't finish my meal and was disappointed."}
{"text":"We came here for Father's Day with a group of 13 people expecting there to be a wait. They told us it would be 30 minutes. We waited the 30 minutes plus another 20 before saying something. They just kept saying it'd be another 20 minutes meanwhile they were sitting everyone else who walked in. We even told them we would sit separately to be able to go back because we had two small children and and 86 year old woman with us. We were all starving and extremely hot. Turns out their AC was broken. That's right.. in 115 degree weather in Las Vegas they had no AC and we had been waiting for over an hour. We got up to leave and go somewhere else and of course that's when they decide to seat us. Looking back we should've just left. 

I ordered a scramble and was expecting hash browns, the toppings (avocado and mushroom) and then the eggs on top but they brought out hash browns on a side plate and then 1 egg and some unmelted cheese, Avocado and mushroom on a plate randomly. Definitely not a scramble, but I definitely got charged for one. 


The whole experience was miserable and We were all sweaty and irritated by the time we were done."}
{"text":"Service was great and the abundance of food made it worth while. Even tho I couldn't finish my food it was tasteful. Although I expected a lil more spinach in my dish it had enough for a couple of delicious bites."}
{"text":"Food was great! Went there with my mother, portions are great size. The service was quick and efficient. I had a ribeye breakfast which tasted spectacular I will definitely be coming here again. Average you pay about $20 per person with drink. my server was incredibly helpful (tahra) something like that but she suggested a few of her favorites and the restaurants top sellers. :) great service!"}
{"text":"First time trying this chain and we'll be back as prices are reasonable for portions (easily share) and good off-strip homey food.

Atmosphere - Definite country feel with cute bear decorations all over.  Love the counter chairs!

Pretty good service - Even though our waitress, Ashley, didn't show up after our food was delivered, we flagged down another waitress and a busboy to get more coffee and water, and they were quick!

Huge portions, but the food is good (hit/miss?).  Hash Browns (ordered crispy) were awesome!  Corned Beef Hash LOOKED really good (thick chunks of shredded beef) but it had absolutely NO taste!  So disappointed.  Denver Omelette was pretty tasty, but came out \"done\" vs. \"soft\" (as ordered).  Coffee was good vs. watered-down stuff at other places.  Saw a Taco Salad go by - must've been the size of a soccer ball!!!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised it was better than expected for my first time at a Black Bear Diner. Coffee was strong and smooth. Orange juice was freshly squeezed and you can definitely taste it - so good! 
Everything tasted like it was made fresh to order so no complaints here! :)"}
{"text":"I didn't even bother to sit down and eat. I came in with two simple questions. It being my first time there and all. I got interrupted twice by an older gentleman with an attitude who basically told me they were too busy to answer questions and I should come back between 2-4 if I didn't want to eat. 
I was planning on eating but didn't . 
Ended up walking out the door. 
I was there for a total of ten minutes. 
No one was sat and employees were rude. 
Don't eat here."}
{"text":"This diner is one of my favorite places to eat for breakfast! The service is great! The food is even better! I highly recommend this place for a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"I came here with my family today hoping that we would receive better service than the last time we came in on 1/30/2016 but unfortunately that was not the case.

We were seated at our table and the server came by 5 minutes later only to tell us that she would be right back to take our drink order. She then proceeded to take the order of the table behind us who had been seated after we were.

We waited another 5 minutes and she passed by 4 times without even acknowledging us. At that point after we waited so patiently, we left and decided to go to the Village Inn a minute away and we were eating in less than 10 minutes and we received amazing service there.

I will never come back to this place."}
{"text":"Good diner food. Fast friendly service. Decor is a little tacky but the food is worth staring out the windows for."}
{"text":"Always a great time and awesome food at Black Bear! Huge portions for good prices."}
{"text":"horrid service, cold, bland tasteless food.  the sausage gravy was so disgusting!"}
{"text":"Good traditional American staples just like Mom used to make it, and at very reasonable prices. Unfortunately, the good food is often ruined by the poor service at the West Tropicana location. Simple orders botched, or else patrons completely ignored. I have walked out more than once because of the bad service."}
{"text":"Food was great. We went for breakfast and the men had the volcano which was simply delicious. Took awhile for the food  to come out but that was to be expected considering it was Fathers Day. Waiter and staff were happy and polite. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Brought the family for lunch after kids football game. Had a delicious meal & best of all our waiter Andres. He explained the menu portions, specials, always checked on us with a smile.. amazing customer service! You dont see that anymore!"}
{"text":"My husband and I totally enjoyed this diner. Portions are huge and the prices are more than fair. Friendly service and flexible when you want to make adjustments to the food you're ordering from the menu. We will be coming back for sure. We lived our server Marci!!"}
{"text":"Great staff, great food, great atmosphere. The sweet cream anything is to-die for. Breakfasts are out of this world, as are lunches. They just added their variation of a Cuban sandwich and I can't wait to try it. If you're daring enough, order the biscuits and gravy. If you don't like throwing food away, make sure to make it a \"half\" order."}
{"text":"Good food, great people, awesome service, but kinda disappointed there was no black bears in the vicinity."}
{"text":"Wife and I went first time I've ever been to a black bear diner. The food was very good it reminded me of grandma's cooking. We both got the chicken fried steak and the portion was huge! The price was more than fair for what we got. Not sure what the bad reviews are talking about i thought it was great! This is my new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch, it was super quiet. Loved the quaint menu, which is inside a newspaper. Waitstaff was fairly prompt and nice. The peach tea didn't have much flavor according to my friend. 

Ordered basics such as chicken parmigiana and country fried steak. The steak was really good and the sides are perfect. The chicken parm was good, but the spaghetti is over cooked and the sauce was super bland like from a can.  The vegetables were tasty and good for being a diner. 

Corn muffins were delicious and the servings are huge. Didn't have room for dessert! 

There's also a little area where you can buy bear souvenirs and tshirts. You pay at the cashier when you are done with your meal."}
{"text":"I rarely give one stars and something must go terribly wrong to warrant it. This was exactly the case with my past visit.  

Here we go... 
 
During the check in process a fellow customer was agitated that we stood in front of him while waiting for our table. It was crowded and we apologized for offending him and clarified that it was an accident. The rowdy customer then went BONKERS. He was clearly belligerent (drunk? on drugs? Who knows... The only thing that was clear was that this dude was out of his mind). He proceeded to make outlandish threats to my husband and I. 

We immediately stepped away from this guy and we requested management to intervene. The manager advised us to calm down and  offered to sit us away from each other. Ummm...No thanks.  We were out of there lickity-split. 

A batty customer ... Extremely poor management ... This whole thing was nutty! The lack of proper management for this random situation is inexcusable. I was very confused, scared and floored by the entire situation. I wanted no further part in the entire situation and we left promptly and went to Jamms and had a wonderful (drama free) breakfast.

One should feel safe in a restaurant and I will never step foot in that hole again. No way.. No how.. I understand they can't help their clientele. However, they clearly botched this all the way around. It was horrible, scary, and I want no part in anything like that ever again!"}
{"text":"Everything we tasted was amazingly delicious.  hubby ordered chicken fried steak with extra gravy on the side to put on these amazing freshly made-from-scratch biscuits.  These arent typical biscuits that you get at most places.  They're squared as if cut from a pan and extra fluffly & buttery.   Their sausage gravy was the most savory gravy we've tasted and i am not a fan of white gravy but theirs was too good to resist. Just amazing. i ordered the bacon pancakes and was not disapointed. All bacon pancakes i have had before always fell short of expectations.  These were fluffly, sweet with plenty of bacon in them (Finally!!!).  also their fresh squeezed orange juice was perfect. Would love to know where they buy their oranges!  The place was tastefully decorated for the holidays while keeping their cabin theme. So so cute and cozy!  Their servers were fast and friendly.  Only downside is the waiting area on sunday. There isnt really one for a place that is clearly very popular.  Lots of us were standing and squeezing together before the receptionist in a tiny area that has a big jukebox, cabinet with cute black bears merhandise and newpaper stands and something else that was bulky (i cant remember).  I feared my husband would lose patience with the tight squeeze and leave.  There's a fridge display with lots of delicious looking  home made pies next to the receptionist. I would love to have browsed but then i'd be in the way of people walking thru to leave & to get to their tables.  i have to wonder how they can sell any if their merchandise when there is people standing in front of it blocking most of the view. 

But again, amazing food!  That is why there were so many people waiting in an uncomfortable space! It was worth the wait, which thankfully was not long at all for 2 people (10-15 mins?) We cant wait to go back, but i think we'll try a time that isn't busy."}
{"text":"The food was really good, and the service was superb! The place was really crowded. Some of the best chicken fried steak that I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"Have tried twice to have breakfast here and both times the wait was prohibitive.  Gave up both times and will not try again.  What can one do to eggs to make people want to wait on long lines to eat?

Don't know if this place deserves four or five stars, but not having eaten there, I can only give a one star rating because when you're hungry you should be able to eat."}
{"text":"Love this place! Portions are perfect, coffee tastes awesome, and the staff is incredibly friendly. Oh, and the PIES! Get a pie for desert at least once!"}
{"text":"The pancakes were delicious! The rest of the meal was pretty good so we will be going back"}
{"text":"Nice breakfast! Pancakes are like no other... Not too much by way of lunch or dinner to brag about, but the breakfast is great! It's a local favorite and keeps the kids busy with all the bears in the place!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place out. Waited close to 10 minutes to be seated. Menus are in newspaper format, restaurant itself looked a bit outdated. There was quite a bit of variety which I liked. I ordered the grizz which came with 2 pancakes (which were to die for), 3 eggs, 2 slices of thick cut bacon, 2 sausage links, a small wedge of ham, & either hashbrowns or country potatoes, cost was $11.49. Food was very tasty. They do not carry chalula hot sauce which was a bummer but oh well. I wanted to try a bear claw but was so stuffed I didn't even try, maybe next time."}
{"text":"Love this diner.  Great food. Goid service. Convenient location. Love to stop here for breakfast. The food and service are always consistant."}
{"text":"So... as they say all that glitters is not gold. I tried this diner again for breakfast as indicated in my earlier review, and, unfortunately, it did not live up to the previous visit. My expectations were definitely not met.

To start, we had to wait a L-O-N-G time for a table. Then, when seated, they have gave us a table for six when we only needed room for four. I assume that's what took so long. Before we ordered, I observed two individuals who had arrived after us paying their check and we had yet to order, that's how long of a wait I mean.

Then, I specifically asked the waitress, are the waffles crispy? She says yes. So, I ordered a crispy waffle. Now, when the waffles arrives, do you think it was crispy? You already know it wasn't. The PROBLEM is on principle, she knows there is NO way to make a crispy waffle at this restaurant. Why you ask? Because they have a personalized waffle maker which has a bear paw imprint into the center of the waffle. This however prevents the waffle from ever becoming crispy because there are insufficient ridges with which to generate crispiness during the cooking process thereby rendering the product a waffle shaped pancake with is generally flat in the middle. Thus, the waitress mislead me, I don't like that and had another item selected already in the event that she would have been truthful and said no our restaurant serves waffle shaped pancakes. That makes me mad. I really wanted a Crispy Waffle. Do not order the waffles if you think they're going to be crispy because you will be disappointed as I was.

Now, my daughter ordered the pineapple upside-down pancakes. They were also misrepresented. The description on the menu indicated that there would be brown sugar marinated pineapple chunks inside of fluffy waffles with a maraschino cherry. There was no brown sugar marination, the pancakes  were fluffy, but the taste of pineapple did not penetrate the normal pancake batter, there was no sugar, and so they should have just been called pineapple topped pancakes.

My other daughter ordered the crispy chicken sandwich. Now, the crispy chicken sandwich is actually very delicious. Hence the reason I'm not giving them two stars.

So you ask, would you come here again? Yes. However, I would only eat lunch, their sandwiches and burgers are good, breakfast not so much and the dinner's seemed really heavy which is not my kind of food."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on New Year's Day, the wait was a little long but that was expected on a holiday. We got sat in about 25 minutes. Our server was wonderful! Andres had our food out quickly and it was delicious. He couldn't have done anything better. The atmosphere is very cute!"}
{"text":"First time here because I heard a lot of good things about this restaurant and decided to give it a try. The food was just okay, I asked if they have turkey bacon or sausage but they didn't have any other substituon for people like me who cant have bacon or pork sausage for a religion reason. Then come the worst service from Barbara who from the beginning wasn't very attentive. Literally she was just there to take the order and drop the check. Hello, where is the service? She never came by to take away my empty plates, or refill my drink. Then when I asked for my water to be refill she brought a new one WITHOUT A STRAW but yet with her biggest attitude. At the end here she comes to drop the check after nowhere to be found. She had the gut to rush me and my husband by trying to take the plates away that still had food on it. And when we asked another server for a togo box for our food since our server nowhere to be found again, this server wasnt happy that we asked her maybe because she thought it wasnt her table. All in all these servers need to improve their customer service skill and maybe common sense. People come here to have a good meal and good service experience not to look at angry n mad faces from your servers. If you dont like your job stay home please these people dont deserve to experience your unhappiness."}
{"text":"Huge portions,Had the breakfast special. It was delicious. Couldn't give the 5th star because the food was a little cold. Server was awesome very nice and took time to care for newbies..."}
{"text":"Here is a very good restaurant and to find someplace where I can take the my boys and they will eat good.  They were able to find something they all liked, the service was very good, the food quality was good and the prices were OK.

If you are looking for a place without the crowds of the Las Vegas Strip, then you need to come here for a good meal.  You are in a good part of town, the packing lot is lit up and the wait to be sat down is good."}
{"text":"We LOVE Black Bear Diner!!! The food is great. We especially love the Chicken Pot Pie and the Chicken & Waffles. And the pies are sooo good. It is a good value and the service is always good.

I'm only taking a star because on 3 out of 6 visits, we were given dirty silverware. It's pretty unappetizing to pick up your unused fork and see somebody else's dinner still stuck to it."}
{"text":"I dine here for breakfast/brunch only and only on weekends. There's always a wait for a table but it doesn't last for too long.

You can go healthy (fruit bowl and some oatmeal) but there's not a lot of fun in that, is there? You can do healthy at home. Be a man, ladies, and order one of the ginormous breakfast platters. I'll split it with you.

Ample portions like Sofia Vergara in a tube top, y'all. Your plate is about as big around as a steering wheel and there's no vacancy on it. 

They make a damn good chicken-fried steak and there's enough of it to share. If you order the \"Big Foot\" version, there's enough to feed two adults with leftovers. It comes with a few eggs cooked to order, hash browns and biscuits. The biscuits are made in house and they are quite remarkable. The omelets are also huge and delicious. The hot sauce on your table goes well with eggs. 

Ask to be seated in Molly's section if it's possible. If she doesn't love her job, she's awesome at faking it."}
{"text":"The good Yelp average got me on this one. I was skeptical as soon as I walked in. I was reminded of Village Inn. Food came - eggs and chicken/apple sausage. Grease dripping from sausage and eggs. Not my cup of tea. Coffee? Let's just say QT's coffee is better. Not going back. Sorry, I cannot buy into this place being that great."}
{"text":"Does everyone hate working here? I've come several times at various times and every time EVERYTIME the servers male and female always seem to hate their job.  Does management not see this? Like a smile doesn't take much even a fake one can go along way.  Our service only improved after she caught me looking at yelp.  It sucks cause I love the food but god it's not worth being dragged down by the servers lackluster attitudes. I"}
{"text":"So I've been here twice now. The first time I ordered the chicken fried steak with fresh squeezed orange juice. The orange juice is so fresh that you can actually watch their fancy machine squeeze oranges if you sit near the counter. The second time here, I got the tri-tip French dip. The Au Jus that came with the sandwich was insane-dark, salty, and robust. The bread was fresh-crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. It's worth it to get the sandwich upgraded to \"deluxe\" because it's only some $0.50 more (deluxe= grilled onions, mushrooms and cheese). My fiancé got \"The Grizz\" breakfast combo both times. They make their sausage in house and the pancakes are probably the best I've ever had.  Both of my experiences have been great. They serve large portions of comfort food-who could possibly complain?"}
{"text":"The best place to eat! Great food, great service, all for a great price. I would recommend. I got the California eggs Benedict. Portions are massive too!"}
{"text":"Went last night to have breakfast. 
Have not been here for sometime since they stopped serving South of the Border Omelette. 
They serve Chorizo Scramble, but it's no where near as tasty & still leaves you craving chorizo.
Since they no longer serve South of the Border Omelette, I ordered a California Omelette & had them add Chorizo along with the Avocado & Jack Cheese. 
Of course it added $2 to the cost but was ok with me.
Food & Service was 5 stars but down rated  to 4+ stars due to cost about $11?

If you read the \"place mat\" BB credo states that if you prefer your meal different than shown in menu, to ask waiter & they would do their best to accommodate you.
This our waiter & cook did when I asked.
Waiter was very friendly and continuously checked on us.
We have always had great service here.

Omelette came out great & was really fantastic tasting!

Had Hash Browns which was great and very similar to years back. Sometime back, I believe they substituted russet for a while which was crumbly & not as tasty as \"new or red\" potato as used now.

The Menu appears to have really shrunk and not as interesting but I generally come for the breakfast & know what I want to order.

Sorry I took picture of my omelette after eating half. Couldn't wait to dig in after  smelling the aroma of and seeing the Chorizo Omelette.

It would be nice if they brought back the South of the Border Omelette & dump the Scramble. 
I know at least 6 or 8 others that used to come just for that omelette, same as me."}
{"text":"First weekend this location was open and they did great. My boyfriend and I walked in, were greeted right away. We were asked if we wanted to sit at the counter instead of waiting for a table and we said absolutely. The wait would have been about 40mins. When we sat down, we were greeted immediately. We had a great server, that was very attentive. Our food was ready fairly quickly. Both delicious and a huge portion. I ordered a fiesta scrambler and he ordered volcano breakfast with harvest grain pancakes. He wasn't even able to finish all his and he can always finish his meals. The price was decent and for being a new location, everything for us ran smoothly. We would recommend this place and we will be back."}
{"text":"Come here with an appetite! We had the Bigfoot chicken fried steak and the small volcano during breakfast time.The service was excellent and the food was very good--portions are enough for a small army! The whole place is decorated with bears, and this seems to be a locals' spot. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Super shocked this place doesn't already have a 5 star rating! It is SO PERFECT AND QUAINT - speedy service, greeted upon entry with smiles, great food, vegetarian options!, staff all seems to work together really well, calm environment with pleasant music, I even noticed how the manager and staff remember previous customers.  The decor is too cute WE WILL BE REGULARS Thanks so much for making our day"}
{"text":"I love this place! First off, the bear decor everywhere is so charming. Their food is everything I look for in a good meal: hearty, delicious, comforting. The chicken-fried steak meal is perfection! And anytime you walk into a restaurant that has their pies on display, you know they have some good pie!! Just know that the portions of food are very large so you'll probably be safe to split your pie with someone. Additionally, the staff is very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Ive got to say that the untrained host was the nicest person there yesterday. I go in to place a to go order and the server that i had was extremely rude and disrespectful. To top it off... The food i got was disgusting. I ordered biscuits and gravy and guess what was pretty much missing. The gravy. There was enough for maybe a 1/2 a biscuit if that and it had no flavor. Oh and my bacon was missing. For the amount of money i payed you would think they would have gotten it right. Such a shame too. Ive never had any issues with this location."}
{"text":"We had brunch at the Henderson location. This past Saturday & didn't have wait too long for a booth. Very cute black bears every where!  Country cooking large portions & good food! Prices are good & fast friendly service! I had a cheese omelette & a huge country biscuit (that I could barely eat). My son had a French dip & a load of French fries & his fiancé had a cheeseburger deluxe. We all enjoyed this place!"}
{"text":"Haven't had my food yet. Almost 20 mins. Heard my waitress complaining about the store, managers, money, tip share etc. manager behind me is having a one on one with a team member who is in trouble. This is so awkward. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food a plus more than you need.  Very accommodating about tweaking menu for you."}
{"text":"We came here on Thursday, January 18th around 9 a.m., before we had to drive back to California.
I absolutely loved our waitress, Kaylee! She was stellar.
The restaurant was nice and clean, the food was excellent. Those pancakes are the bomb. The food came out fast, and Kaylee even made perfectly sure my mom got extra crispy hash browns. Our order was accurate. Thanks for giving us such a great breakfast. And again, I can't stress how great Kaylee is (:"}
{"text":"Management of this location, is off the charts (positive). As someone else remarked, not really a \"Las Vegas experience\", but solid breakfast dishes, no bargains.  Wish they would fix up (dress up) the outside front entrance.  Staff here clearly trained and \"under the thumb\" of management.  I'll return but there are so many other great breakfast options in Vegas...

Pik attached, plain omelette, big portion.  With tax, $12+tip."}
{"text":"This is one of the best managed Black Bear Diner restaurants I've been in, over the years, and that includes California and Oregon. The manager was visible and totally involved, the employees were well trained and clearly knew their tasks, but still managed to be friendly. Had the chicken fried steak (pik attached), and it was good. 

Management and training really did stand out, hard to imagine how anyone would be disappointed by a visit here."}
{"text":"If I could rate this place 0 Stars I would! My family has loved other locations for the Black Bear Diner franchises. But this location is seriously messed up! Several times I have been there and my glasses or utensils look completely disgusting. A few times I have gotten sick right away after eating. And today myself, my husband and my daughter all got sick at the same exact time while we were eating! I have pulled up on my other screen the Complaint Form to the Southern Nevada Health District. Yes I am complaining about this location at this point. In the past I have talked to management with no recourse. Something has to give. And I believe that it is something that they are doing with the food or NOT doing properly that is causing this because all three of us ate different things!"}
{"text":"Breakfast crew is awesome. Food during breakfast is very yummy. Been twice for dinner and both times I was disappointed. First time I got ribs which were good although it took more than 45 min to get our food. 2nd time I got the California burger which didn't come out until after the rest of my family's food came out. Menu offers gluten free bun but it is nonexistent. Not many GF options for dinner. Son asked for lemonade and they were out. Expect to be here a while for dinner especially if it's busy. This is new to Laveen and hopefully it is only growing pains. I will NOT be back for dinner. Breakfast is a go!"}
{"text":"I've never had the chicken and waffle meal..ever. Anywhere. Just moved to Vegas and wanted to try something new. IT WAS AMAZING!!!!!! This just became my new favorite place! I'll be back weekly!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the decor,  as first time patrons.  Thought  the pajamas for sale were cute,  but couldn't find a price on the 3t ones.

Had the chicken  club, not a fan of triple decker style sandwiches and the chicken was a little too seasoned with rosemary for my taste . I also prefer my Cole slaw cold, it was kinda room temp. My daughter's steak was cooked well done instead of medium and my husband's sandwich had cheese when he asked for without. The tri tip sandwich is a bit spicy,  beware!  Overall good food and service was nice. I looked at other tables dishes,  and already have a mental list of things to try.
Would return to try some more dishes, but please be more attentive when putting in food orders."}
{"text":"I come here for a quick country breakfast fix. Guaranteed to leave this place with a happy, full stomach. The servers are on their best game. I order, get my coffee, and served within 15 minutes or less on some days. Prices are right and even better, the servings are large here. Good for sharing. They offer smaller portions too, but be prepared either way. 

Their sweet cream pancakes are the biggest rave! I can't argue with that. They taste like birthday cake, minus the icing. Fluffy, moist, and the right amount of sweet. The country fried steak is a must try! Hailing from the mid-west, a good fried steak is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. They DO that here. They use the same technique with their hash browns. Add some Heinz 57 to them, you're in for treat.  

Although located in a busy area and at times can be packed full of people, it's worth making the stop. The lumberjack-like atmosphere and teddy bears gives this place its name. They do country right here folks."}
{"text":"Our first experience was great. Customer service was wonderful. Their friendly hosts and waiters have an up beat which always pulls me back to returning to a diner. I will definitely return. Nice atmosphere and food was delicious. The cost was a bit pricey but was worth it."}
{"text":"I loved the folk service and the decor, felt really homey! Our waitress was really sweet, with the cutest southern accent. Food was pretty good, we had dinner but I will be back to try their breakfast! We had the apple crumb cake which was A M A Z I N G! Will def be back!"}
{"text":"Have been to different locations for lunch and dinner. Came to this location for breakfast. We ordered the sausage patty breakfast with a pancake and hash browns and also the pineapple upside down cake pancakes. The hash browns are freshly shredded, need I say more? The pineapple pancakes were amazing- sweet and the pineapple was still juicy. Only one cheery on these big bad boys?? :( The sausage was fresh, not the pre frozen little tiny ones you'd find at the other places. All in all we will back as the server told us they have French toast made out of their bear claws :0"}
{"text":"My family and I went to this restaurant and the food was high-quality and delicious the portions were big but the food was Heaven they actually served real hand squeezed orange juice we ordered the Grizz the food was so much I could feed at least us and two more people In the end all in all this was the best restaurant I ever went I give it 5 stars"}
{"text":"Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's not. Everything tastes the same to be honest, so if you don't mind that this is the place for you. They have a great breakfast menu and the staff is attentive and nice. In all honesty the prices are a little on the high end for quality of food."}
{"text":"The food was overly fantastically delicious. The portion size was great. I had the bacon and egg plate with potatoes. Other people at my table had omelet, French toast, pancake and waffle. I had a nibble taste of their food and it was also good. The service was great. I would make this a regular when visiting las Vegas."}
{"text":"Whoa, a woman lost a $70000 engagement ring in the toilet at this place!

\"A Phoenix plumber became a hero after retrieving a $70,000 ring that had been flushed down the toilet of a Phoenix restaurant.

\"We just did what we do,\" said Mike Roberts, general manager of Mr. Rooter, a plumbing company. Roberts said he spent about eight hours fishing down the toilet with a fiber optic cable on Jan. 14.

The woman, Allison Berry, from California had gone to the restroom after eating at Phoenix's Black Bear Diner, 2410 West Bell Road when the accident happened. Her 7-carat diamond ring slipped off her finger and into the toilet as she was pulling up her pants, she reportedly told a waitress.\"

{"text":"Hadn't done the weekly food shopping run and it was already dinner time on a Saturday (9/11/2017) night.  All I wanted to do was find an inexpensive diner with some good food for myself, my wife and our two kids.  From the moment we walked into the door, every staff member gave us a smile and made us feel welcome while attending to their normal duties.  It immediately came across as a warm and happy environment.  I love when I can walk into a place and feel like the employees actual like where they work.  Service was superb as we were immediately seated, drinks never ran empty and the waitstaff constantly checked in with us without brooding or coming off as imposing.  My wife and I were both torn between dishes, so our server, Anthony, let us know his favorites.  The food did not disappoint as I had one of the best home cooked chicken pot pies I have had in a long time.  My wife was beyond stuffed with her Chimichuree steak dish.  My son plowed through his ribs and my daughter was thrilled to have dinner pancakes.  We were fortunate to meet Marlene, the night time supervisor, as she made us laugh and smile.  As a recent Las Vegas local, I can definitely say I would recommend Black Bear Diner to anyone looking for a great meal at a reasonable price.  Further, my family and I will become returning customers.  Thank you for a great meal and a good time."}
{"text":"BEARy Deliciousness!!!!! This diner is the perfect breakfast spot. You forget the craziness of Vegas the second you pull up. The hostesses are all very friendly and the waiters are polite and well knowledges about the menu. This family atmosphere is unparalleled throughout Vegas. 

Now onto the food...even better! I ordered some of the fresh squeezed orange juice and wow was it fresh. Not something I'd expect to find in Vegas but I saw them personally squeeze it and I was amazed. It was quite the compliment to the food. 
I ordered the Joe's Hobo Omelette. Stuffed with a bunch of meat along with onion and spinach. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the omelette was so tasty. I ordered the red potatoes as a side, which weren't as crispy as I liked but still very good. I would definitely recommend trying this omelette. 

Finally, the best part, the pancakes. The other two people I ate with ordered the pancakes and couldn't shut up about them so I had to try. One sweet delicious bite led to about 15 more. They were hands down the best pancakes I've ever had. So thick and they melted in your mouth along with the syrup that tasted like it came straight from a log cabin. The pancakes are a must try!! I'm serious!!

If you're looking for a breakfast to start your day off right stop looking and drive here immediately. You will not regret it I can promise you that. Enjoy :))"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with the service this Christmas Day morning. We arrived to be greeted which was good and when we told the host how many people she said \"it'll be a couple minutes\". Great we thought we will be seated here shortly. We browsed through the little gift shop they have and of course more people continued to come inside. We noticed a family of four that had just walked in immediately was seated. I figured they had written their name down but only until it happened a second time did I say wow what's going on here. I mentioned to the hostess we've been skipped twice now can you write my name down and she apologized and proceeded to write my name down. We then waited again only to have it happen a third time until I told a different hostess we were here first. He wasn't aware of the previous mistakes that were committed which I can understand. It wasn't a complete disaster all I wish is that they would communicate a lot better and have better organization. We left because our experience was already  a disaster and I know all we would've talked about at the table would've been this fiasco. Please communicate better for present and future customers. Merry Christmas!"}
{"text":"I have been to other locations and happy to have one close to the house. First experience was pleasant. Had the meatloaf dinner. I really enjoyed it and the vegetables were cooked perfectly. I have also been here for breakfast and I always enjoy it."}
{"text":"Always good food at Tropicana location.  And same at this location. You can count on Black Bear to deliver great food no matter were you eat. This location is clean.  Staff is professional and egar to please. Will be back"}
{"text":"We were in town for the Super Bowl and found this place on Yelp for breakfast.  The menu had a good variety of items with decent pricing. The service was outstanding. Very efficient with multiple refills on my coffee. I never had to ask. The coffee was good and hot. I loved the mugs. We opted for the omelette, both of which were delicious with fresh ingredients. The potatoes were also \"real\" (not box) with onions and peppers mixed in. We were so pleased with our breakfast we came back the next day. I wish we had a Black Bear Diner in NY."}
{"text":"great food, very clean,outstanding staff, we pass bye other places to go here"}
{"text":"Mike our server.....best server I've had in Vegas in some time. First time visitor and they will now have a new regular. Tried the Denver omelette. Won't be ordering anyone else's again. Great service. Great music"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast after being
In Vegas for business. Was getting really tired of overpaying for crappy hotel breakfasts. This place is about 10 minutes off the strip--but worth it if can make it. Great tasting food, hearty portions, and excellent service. I had the meat lovers omelet with a side of fruit. It was excellent and the home made biscuit was soft and fluffy. Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"Let's face it you know what you want when you aim for a diner. This ain't no elegant affair. And it's on target. This is a hometown style, family-friendly diner with all the comfort food you'll need at a fair price. 

Service quality has been iffy lately, which usually speaks to a management issue. But I have never had a bad meal here. Slow service, dispassionate service, but the food has always been tasty. The atmosphere is a bit on the dark and dingy side.

Check out the menu online. There's plenty to choose from. And whatever you get, you're likey to be taking some home in a carry out box. The portions are huge.

For breakfast, I'm a fan of the Pancakes and the Biscuit & Country Gravy with 2 Slices of Thick-Cut Smoked Bacon. Toward lunch time love the Open Faced Hot Turkey sandwich. For dinner, it's the chicken fried chicken... they call it: Hand-Breaded Crispy Chicken Breast. Exceptionally tasty.

I'm looking forward to a future Friday so I can try the Fish Fry. I'll update when I make that happen."}
{"text":"If I could sum up Black Bear Diner in one word, I'd use Dependable.  You always know what you are going to get.  I've been to a couple of black bear diners and have always enjoyed the experience.

This one was in Las Vegas.  We did not have a reservation for a party of 10 people but they got us in pretty quickly.  Our server was always on top of our meals and refills.  I had The Bear's Choice: two eggs (fried), pancake and bacon. Others got the scrambles, toasts, omelettes and sides.

Coffee was diner coffee. I love the motif and have to stop myself each time from buying the cute stuffed bears."}
{"text":"Food was great. Restaurant was clean. Nobody in the front to greet us when we entered. Took a little bit to be greeted and seated. Our waitress was horrible!!!! She took our drink order then brought them over with a promise to return with straws and she never did! We had to ask another waiter for straws. She got one of our burgers all the way wrong. She was very slow in her speech and her return to our table. Even when we asked for hot sauce and napkins she took forever to come back. She still didn't bring back any napkins during our whole stay. We asked for a dessert menu and she gladly brought one back then took forever to come back and take our dessert order. She had no name tag so I have no idea what her name is! Just a horrible waitress all together! As she approached every other table she kept apologizing for the long wait. The restaurant wasn't even that busy for the amount of time we waited each time for her to come back! We will be back to eat here and hopefully she's not working here anymore!"}
{"text":"'Cause sometimes you just want comfort food. We had the tortilla soup which was good and then the chicken fried steak and pecan crusted trout. The only downside was our waitress, who started out well, seemed to forget about us. No drink refills and then finally we had to have the hostess track her down for our check."}
{"text":"1st time eating here and the experience was great! Service was excellent! Food choices were tough to figure out, I could have ate 10 different items. The atmosphere is warm feeling, cabin feel. Definitely will return! I can't wait to try the breakfast!"}
{"text":"The best orange juice and bacon pancakes I've ever had. They have a very distinct pancake batter which offers an explosion of sweet flavor in every bite. We sat at the counter for a true 1950's dining experience. The menu comes in the form of a newspaper which is quite neat-o if you like to pretend you're reading a newspaper while eating breakfast. The portions are YUGE! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I'd like to start off by saying that if you are looking for a place that makes you feel like you aren't in Vegas anymore, this is the spot. Not only does it feel like you are in a log cabin in the mountains upon walking in, the service also screams family owned even though it's a large chain. Every time we've come (usually once a week) we've had Phenomenal customer service, the food is to die for for the low price point and comes in such large portions no matter how hungry you are you'll leave with a to go box and a full stomach. Shout out to Flower and Don for making today extra special for my Boyfriends birthday. We will definitely continue to be long time regulars."}
{"text":"I ate at this restaurant for the first time. It was a busy time in the morning and was run very efficiently. I only waited about 15 minutes on cute wooden benches decorated with bear paws. The entire restaurant was very quaint with menus that looked like old newspapers.  I loved reading the news from the 1950's while we waited for our food.  It was breakfast time but we were able to choose from breakfast, lunch or dinner !  I loved this about this restaurant.  I tried the pecan crusted trout which was delicious and the red skinned mashed potatoes were fabulous too.  The wait staff was very friendly and attentive. I will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews I was excited to try this place.  There was a 20 minute wait, which I kind of expected from reading other reviews.  It had a homey atmosphere and we passed the time looking at all the bear themed décor.  The furniture looked like it was made from logs and there were a few well placed bears through out the restaurant.
 When we were seated, we were brought our drinks quickly by a cheerful waitress.  That is where the good experience ended.
 I ordered chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and veggies.  The food was under seasoned and over cooked.  My husband ordered a ham and cheese omelet with their homemade sausage on the side.  The cheese wasn't melted on the inside, and we had asked our waitress if the sausage was spicy and she said no.  It was inedible it was so spicy.  She then said it depends on who is making the batch on how spicy it is.  A little consistency would go a long way.   It tasted like your typical diner fare, but not a good diner, more on the lines of a tired chef just trying to get the orders out with no enthusiasm left.  Even though there were signs everywhere for pie, the food was too disappointing to want to try dessert.
The bill came to $32 which I thought was on the expensive side for what we received."}
{"text":"Very cozy. Cute decor of black bears. The food was a little of a wait, but everything came out hot and perfect. It was very delicious. Also had a banana cream pie and a coconut cream pie. I recommend this to anyone coming into town."}
{"text":"I work in the restaurant business and the most important thing to me is customer service and first impression... let me tell you this place has it. As far as the food it's your typical breakfast food nothing out of the ordinary and definitely not bad either!!! The staff was super nice and made sure that we were helped! However I believe our servers name was Zoe she was awesome! Friendly face and made sure we had what we needed! If not for the food we'd come back for the friendly staff!!!"}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas and wanted to get some great breakfast off of the strip. Black Bear delivered! All of the staff was very friendly and attentive! By the time I left, several people were calling me by my first name. I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak with Eggs, hash browns and biscuits. Mammoth biscuits that were incredible!! Chicken fried steak was the bet I've had in ages, if not ever. Biscuits were delicious, hash browns could have been a little more crispy for my liking. Coffee was also good. I will come back here on ever Vegas trip adventure!!"}
{"text":"The place was very busy on 23 AUG, so temper my critique with that in mind.
Our waitress Tara, was very friendly, but she was very busy, we got our drinks, then it took a while to get our order.
When she brought out the soup and salads, se explained the were out of cornbread muffins.
We finally got our meals, and my rib eye was tasteless and had that crud you get when you take a piece of meat out of the freezer and fry it.
This is one of the reasons I don't like chain restaurants.  But I was a guest."}
{"text":"Why have I taken so long to eat at Black Bear? Idk, but whoever passes this place up over and over again for no reason needs a big ol' claw to the face. (Ok, not really.)

Came in on a Wednesday morning around 9:30 with no wait. Got seated, and all of a sudden the place was packed. I see why they have so many servers running around in those cute bear print suspenders. Everyone I encountered on this visit was nice and attentive.

Food is A-1 at a good price, especially in an age where places are charging a limb & a half for simple breakfast items. I ordered the Taco Salad with Chicken (yes, that early in the am). It was HUGE. Way more than enough for lunch and dinner, so I packed half away before I even got started. Fresh ingredients all around and great house-made bacon ranch dressing. Not bad at all for $10.95.

My companion got a huge pancake platter w/ all the fixins. I had a bite of her pancakes even without syrup and they were perfection. I will definitely be back here to try a lot more stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Went a few days ago on a Tuesday night. Service was great and very friendly staff. Food was really good, had the special that night. I'd probably go back again if I could."}
{"text":"My friends and I used to visit Black Bear at least monthly. Our last visit was completely disappointing. I'm still wondering why they changed the menu a while back when what they had was perfect the way it was.

I ordered the Meatloaf dinner and was disappointed to see the portions were cut down, green bean casserole has been removed from the menu and the texas toast is gone to be replaced with a dry cornbread muffin. After a few bites of my dinner, I was semi grateful that the portions were smaller. One of my friends, who always orders Chicken Fried Steak, was disappointed by the smaller portions and off taste of his meal as well.

If Black Bear Diner wants my business, they need to re-think their \"reinvented\" menu and restore the food quality to what it once was."}
{"text":"I've only been here for breakfast. I love this place, the food is amazing. Big portions for a great price. 

I always have a good experience here; the waiters are nice. Sometimes it gets super busy and you have to wait a bit to get seated, but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. Not that the food is bad just not my taste. I know many ppl that like it but I would rather have traditional breakfast food"}
{"text":"Had eaten here many times since opening. Last visit swore to never come again. Bad service. The server started out great but then disappeared. When we finally got him back asked if I could get something else since the sandwich I ordered was too spicy. We will keep it. It take it home and pay for it so because everyone else is half done with diner. Bring me a grilled cheese sandwich. That will only take a few minutes to cook. He said ok brought the box and then went for drinks for us and never came back for 30 minutes. I asked is that grill cheese coming and the drinks you went for 30 minutes ago he came back said be up any minute. Well all had finished so I said forget it just give me the bill. He left for another 10 minutes. A casual diner turned into a major hassle and I didn't eat. Spoke to manager and she didn't offer anything to help or other but sees us all the time. So avoid the place people. Used to be good but has already turned bad."}
{"text":"Great food , I sat at the bar but as I waited for my food I saw the staff very accommodating to everybody , Lanette provided great service and Ron  leads a great time , first time here and I ll definitely be back ."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to AZ and this place is really close by us so we thought we'd try it out. I'm so glad we did. We've been in Tempe for about 2 1/2 months and have been to Black Bear Diner at least 10-12 times already! It's our go to for breakfast out. The portions are HUGE, the price is reasonable, the service is great and the food is delicious. Very country cabin feel... 

They definitely took the black bear theme and ran with it! Almost to the point of being tacky in my opinion, but I'm there for the food so what do I care?

We haven't had anything we haven't liked on the breakfast menu. My husband LOVES their waffles and I'm a fan of their pancakes. They even have pineapple upside-down pancakes which are scrumptious! Their biscuits are huge and the gravy is good. They also have a spicy sausage patty that they make and it is super flavorful! If you're an OJ person like me, their fresh squeezed orange juice is so good! Oh and definitely go red potatoes over hash browns! Their hash browns are just kind of plain but the potatoes are cooked with onions and peppers and really tasty!

We've only been ordered lunch there once. We both got burgers and they were also pretty good.

Really no complaints! If you want a big breakfast (anytime of day) for a little price, this is the spot!"}
{"text":"Went with the family for breakfast wait was a little long but that was ok as we weren't in a hurry or starving. It was so worth the wait. I had the godfather omelet. It was huge. The biscuit was about a pound and a half. Overall the 8 of us were very happy with the food. Big portions and great tasting. The service could have been better as I needed a refill of my coffee for about 10 minutes. We will come back when we're back in town."}
{"text":"We quit going to the Haymaker for here. Everything is fresh and portions are cooked properly and large. I had fried chicken last time and it was very good 1\2 chicken. Staff friendly and above all very clean. Good job everyone"}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast place.  My 97 year old mother is also delighted with it.  The food, service and music are all great.  We are never disappointed and even though it is 40 miles from home, we go there regularly."}
{"text":"When I got here I was amazed at how many different things there were on the menu. I took forever to choose but I finally came up with getting a western burger within bacon. My wife got pork ribs with onion rings and my mother had the beef stew with vegetables. The burger and beef stew were amazing but we can't say the same for the ribs. This is NOT a legitimate place to get your rib fix. The meat was super tough and seasoned badly, and the bbq sauce was overly sweet. The next time I come I want to try their breakfast and house baked pies!"}
{"text":"Date dined 2/1/15.  We walked into the old Chili's location to find it turned into Dennys meets lodge.  They were quick to greet us, but there was quite a large throng of people waiting, so I was not surprised at the 1/2 hour wait time.  However, there were only two people sitting at the counter.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that we could sit there without the wait!  We love to sit at the counter anyway.  You get a real sense of the place by seeing the kitchen, wait staff, and expeditor working.

The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful.  We ordered coffee (fantastic) and OJ because I loved their fresh squeeze machine (also fantastic) while we perused the menu.  I wanted to try a bit of everything, so I went with the Bears Choice for $8.99 and picked scrambled, 7 grain pancakes, and bacon.  The eggs & bacon were standard, but the 7 grain granola pancakes were divine!  No butter or syrup necessary.

The BF must have been nuts because he ordered the Bigfoot Chicken Fried Steak & eggs meal for $11.99.  It sounds ginormous because it is!!   The steak is smothered in gravy and it comes with three eggs, hashbrowns, and two biscuits as big as my head!  He liked it very much, didn't even make a dent.  Upside is it gave me an opportunity to try more stuff (hee hee) and let me tell you the biscuit is amazing.  

We had a really good experience.  I loved watching their expeditor work because he really ran it like a well oiled machine and caught stuff like an under cooked pork chop from going to a customer.  We will be back."}
{"text":"The food is great and the value is even better. Very clean and friendly place to eat. This is the best spot in the area for large families or groups. 5 star for sure."}
{"text":"Pretty good beak fast place, every meal has been perfect, good coffee, great prices. Beats the heck out of the competition, wish they had one of these in Poway CA hint hint hint!"}
{"text":"Clean rest rooms, friendly wait people, good plentiful food. Enjoyed the food. Everything was done as it should. Not exciting, but acceptable."}
{"text":"Exelent service! Karen is super sweet and good server she always ask if we were ok? And that satisfice me so much 
The food was really good!!! And the orange juice is AMAZING... this place make me feel in the mountains is super cozy SUPER RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"It was good, but not great. Staff was very friendly. Pretty large portions. Prices were reasonable"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it will be the last time there was supposed to be 20 minutes away, but Andrew lied the service was okay, we got in at 730 we didn't get our food still 8 I would not recommend this to anyone..."}
{"text":"This is my first time here I will come back the food was worth it employees were friendly if you get James he will take care of you"}
{"text":"I love Black Bear. Its a nice family restaurant. The food is always amazing and the staff is so friendly. Weekends are always super busy so be prepared to wait awhile for a table."}
{"text":"Service was good but the food was anything but good. We ordered desserts and drinks. My dessert was the bread pudding. It was disgusting! And the sauce on it was too thick. I took 2 bites and wasted the rest. I ended up ordering a plate of fries since I figured if I couldn't have sweet I'd have salty. My husband and daughter shared their cobbler. They said it was ok. 

The restaurant itself didn't appear clean. Have you the feeling that you should probably bring some wet wipes to sanitize. I guess if they're going for that dirty cabin feel they nailed it. (And the place is relatively new.)."}
{"text":"This place is super good! There is a lot of food for the price you pay. I ordered the small volcano and it came with 2 pancakes, an egg (any way you like it), sausage link, and one bacon. I also ordered a side of roasted potatoes and they were delicious. They were fried with onions and peppers as well. He pancake is super good. It's also a cute place to go for brunch or even dinner and it's all served all day! Definitely will be my to go place for brunch from here on out!"}
{"text":"I'm glad this place has come to our little neighborhood. The IHOP's, Denny's, and other franchise diner-like places have long since failed to provide an enjoyable dining experience. The food here was good. The service was fast and friendly. The portions were hearty...And they have coconut cream pie made in house! Not a bad deal for a quick, Enjoyable family meal when we don't have time or are not in the mood for a local café."}
{"text":"I don't even like pancakes and theirs were so good. The waffle was mmmmm.  The biscuits and gravy are pretty good. The eggs Benedict were really good.  No I did not eat all in one sitting I have been there multiple times and will be going back in the future."}
{"text":"So great, the portion sizes are fantastic for the price. I ordered the Country Fried Chicken, it was awesome. The coolest thing was the bar top seating and the juicer machine. Actual fresh squeezed juice made right in front of out and its so so so good. The wait staff is so polite and attentive to your needs. Management comes around to talk to you which is nice because I hate when come around and just ask if you're ok and then just leave, it's like dude just leave me alone if you're not going to engage me. But they and great here and they have a little gift shop and Mama Bear walking around the restaurant for kids. All-n-all pretty damn good."}
{"text":"I know some will be upset with a 3-star review, but I assure that it isn't a matter of dislike. 3-stars is a solid rating for any diner, and The Black Bear Diner is honestly exceptional in regard to what it is.

The food probably most typical of midwestern cuisine, the type of stuff I grew up on for the most part, with a bit of a southern touch thrown in. Portions are midwest-sized, so if you can't eat for two like me, consider splitting a dinner portion unless you want the leftovers. Much of the menu is served covered in gravy, and a delicious one at that. Don't expect any exciting flavors, but you can be sure that whatever you order will be delicious. It's simple to a fault, but the food is good.

Wait staff is friendly and never had bad service, but a bit too much like the food here. They're a bit folksy and bland, but nice and appropriate to the establishment."}
{"text":"new location is awesome! very clean. food is amazing and the service is wonderful. I ate in different black bear locations and I was very happy. fantastic breakfast place"}
{"text":"Cool little breakfast place. Stopped there as left town for Hoover Dam. Great bacon and biscuits and gravy. The portion sizes are large so plan accordingly"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the very first time and I must say it impressed me. I ordered the Portuguese linguica sausage and it was cooked to my liking. Not overly cooked where it's dry but moist and a bit of char on the outside to give that hint of burnt taste. The house potatoes were seasoned deliciously and the wheat toast I had was buttered and tasty. The coffee could've been stronger but not gonna whine about that as I had two cups of coffee already before stepping foot into this restaurant. If you're looking for a breakfast joint while you're in Sin City, give this place a try."}
{"text":"This place has the best home cooking food that you could want. As soon as you walk in the door it smells just like home. We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door an seated. Drinks brought right away. Usually even for lunch I would have ordered pancakes because there pancakes are to die for. The sweet cream goodness is why these are some of my favorite pancakes. But today I had a club which was very good. The bacon crispy an piled high with turkey ham an bacon. My husband has the Rueben an it was equally as good. The good here is always good every time we go. There's no guessing how it's going to be as they are always consistent. Great food an great service. An this one on Durango is so close to the house an just opened last year. They also have the best pies an cobblers so don't forget to try one."}
{"text":"Always great food an great service..the onion rings here aer the best. Perfectly cooked an ohhhh so crunchy on the outside an perfect on the inside..its always a great meal here.."}
{"text":"This place has been a favorite of mine for many years and it's a real treat to see them still busy after all these years.  We went here on a Saturday morning and it was packed full of people with a 25-30 minute wait.  It's one of those places that really should be in a cabin town like Mt. Charleston, but being in the heart of Las Vegas will do too.

Everything they make is HOMEMADE, not that artificial shit you see common in many of my other reviews.  I love homemade food because it's made with passion and ingredients that really give a true flavor.  Black Bear Dinner didn't miss the memo on that.  Although there wait times are extremely long and perhaps service could be better, the food killed it.

I had orange juice and I expected to be served Tropicana or Minute Maid equivalent orange juice and to my surprise it was actually fresh squeezed with REAL orange juice.  You just don't find that anywhere anymore!  My breakfast was French Toast with country smoked bacon.  Perfectly powdered with sugar and the bacon was nice a crisp and you could taste the smoke still from the grill...YUM!  My eggs were good too, the real deal.  I'm a big advocate of restaurants making food from scratch and Black Bear Dinner won't disappoint.  My only real squirm was the service from the servers, but the food outweighed the negligence."}
{"text":"John was our waiter, he was efficient and attentive. We were eating with our twins and he was great about getting us what we needed to meet our needs. The food was exactly what I remembered it being and we needed to go boxes. 

The wait was about 15 minutes at 11:30am on New Year's Eve. The bathrooms were clean. The tea is sweet! We'd eat at this location again"}
{"text":"Visited this diner tonight. It was our first time having dinner there, as we usually visit for breakfast. 
We were seated immediately when we arrived; there was no wait. Our waiter Chris was very friendly and was able to answer any questions we had about the menu. 
I had the Chicken Fried Steak dinner from the \"Little Less\" part of the menu. I can appreciate the huge, generous portions that are normally included, but as a very petite woman, it's nice to have the option of a smaller serving. The serving size I received was still generous, but not overwhelming. It was delicious. Chicken fried steak is one of my favorite foods, and Black Bear certainly didn't let me down. Even the ranch dressing on my salad was unique and above average; I wouldn't be surprised to learn they make it there.

The food, service, and price were all excellent. However, the music was quite loud. It wasn't so loud we had to raise our voices to have a conversation, but it was pretty distracting.

Overall, it was a good experience and I would visit again."}
{"text":"Hefty hefty portions at the most reasonable prices! Everything was absolutely delicious--Black Bear Diner is one of the reasons why breakfast is my favorite meal.

We ordered the massive country fried steak, pancakes, and Godfather's omelette (all less than $12 a plate)--my mouth is watering as I write this review. My family of four had a hard time finishing even 3/4 of all our dishes.

We had to forgo the bear claw, although I regret that now. Sign up for their e-mail list to get a free coffee and bear claw! But you need to sign up a few days before because it takes at least 24 hours for the e-mail to come through.

I'd skip the breakfast buffets and make the detour here. It's in the middle of nowhere but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Huge portions! Down home breakfast that is guaranteed to fill you up. It's not super fancy or updated, but the food was priced accurately and I enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"Great people who work here! Good food. Fresh OJ is amazing too! Portions are big! Service is amazing."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate dinner here tonight, it was our second visit to BBD.  Our first visit was so much better which is why we came back.  I ordered the chicken parm dinner.  It was burn't on the bottom and edges and the penne pasta was overlooked and mushy.  My husband had the Asian salad and he couldn't eat it, no flavor at all. He asked for a different dressing and it didn't improve salad at all.  Our waiter could see he didn't like it and all he said was do you need a box ... really.  We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This family owned restaurant is covered from head to toe in Bears...and it's kinda cute. A very kid-friendly restaurant, but their extensive menu and huge portions will satisfy us big kids as well :) 
We came here for breakfast (mmm...my fav meal of the day!) and when I saw that the prime rib with eggs was the special of the day, I knew that I didn't even have to look at the menu. Though I'm not a huge fan of prime rib, if a joint is making it their special...and for breakfast? I'm all for it....I didn't regret my decision one bit. The prime rib was tender, the au jus that came with it was the best I've ever had. I also tried the California scramble (a nice healthy scramble with loads of veggies and of course avocado), granola pancakes ( nice and fluffy), eggs benedict (not bad, but I prefer canadian bacon versus the thinly sliced deli ham), and the french toast (wasn't a huge fan of this one...for french toast the center of the bread was too dry for me). Overall a good experience, but I took away a star for their service because as other yelpers mentioned, it was unbelievably slow."}
{"text":"Once was enough. Everyone was raving so we tried it. He had breakfast and said \"meh\" and mentioned that he couldn't tell what kind of grease the eggs had been cooked in. But no big deal. However, I had something called that if I recall was a sirloin salad-the name escape me. It was advertised as a garden salad tossed with sliced grilled sirloin. The waitress tried to warn me against the dressing it comes with, offering me a choice of another--I should have taken her up on, I think they got the dressing they used in a hunting shop-think something that might attract a bear or something. The meat was a far from sirloin as it could have been. I couldn't cut it, I couldn't chew it, I have no idea what it was. Never again."}
{"text":"This was our best meal in Vegas thus far!!!. Great little diner with, clearly, a Bear problem.  We had to wait about 10 mins for a table which is a good sign. Gave me time to look at the yelp pics and read some reviews. Chicken fried steak was mentioned in no less than 10 reviews and for just cause it's delicious!! So for a tip I would recommend getting a side of salsa for your eggs. They make it fresh and it is full of flavor!!! They also offer a biscuit, toast or English muffin for this meal.  This is critical for you to have the best meal ever!!!! GET THE BISCUIT!!! 
This is not my 1st rodeo with biscuits but this monster is worth talking about. 1st of all it comes out towering over the rest of the plate like a cumulonibus cloud. I know what your thinking \"something that big has to be dry or crumbly hard\" well like me your wrong!! SURPRISE!!! This is biscuit meets Angel food cake.  It is a moist and super fluffy, softball sized creation.  Their European style whipped butter is one of many appropriate toppings for this beast. I had it 4 ways butter, gravy, strawberry jelly, and egg shrapnel all were glorious!!! Enjoy:-)"}
{"text":"Our waitress was great ... Our food was delish was prepared just prefect ... I would definitely come back !"}
{"text":"I like Black Bear Diner for two reasons:

1. The portions are huge. Anytime I leave a restaurant with a takeout bag that's a good sign. 

2. The quality of the food is great. I had the sweet cream pancakes w/ a side of thick cut bacon. The pancakes were amazing. You almost don't need syrup. 

The floor manager was friendly as well. He came by and talked w/ us for a few minutes while we waited for our food. Real family restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is okay...the gravy is good.  The chef or the waitress didnt get our order correctly.  The portions are big and the biscuit is not all that good.  It's dry."}
{"text":"Food is good for a good price. Right near the South Outlet mall so good spot to fuel up for all that walking. I had the pesto chicken sandwich and I was please. I will be back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to this diner, the food selection is enormous and it all tastes good so far! They give huge portions! I've tried their California bacon Benedict and it's great, also their country fried steak tastes bomb. Even the sides are yummy especially the fries and hash browns.
My bf got the blast blt sandwich and he finished the whole thing. We are going again soon and I eventually want to get the spaghetti and meatballs. Comfort food!"}
{"text":"I brought my cousin who's from Jamaica here for a more traditional style of American breakfast. The food and woodsy ambiance were on point. I had the ham steak which was one of the best I've had. And most important to me on this visit, my cousin found it memorable!"}
{"text":"If u want a full, happy belly and wallet this is the place! Great service and yummy food! Will return For sure!!! ^^"}
{"text":"I was sold on the photos and when my family and I finally went today I can say the photos says it all. The food was delicious! and service was great! We will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"If you're used to food that is not up to par, this is the place for you.  The wait staff is alright, but should try to pick up the pace a bit.  Only having about eight tables and three waiters/waitresses at the time, I shouldn't have to wait 10 minutes for a drink refill.  As for the food, I had the fried fish and shrimp and it was okay.  A little over cooked and just plain boring.  Very typical diner food and unique bear / lodge type theme.  The kids menu is cute, but my son even have this place a thumbs down on taste.  I will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Excellent service by Monique for dinner this evening with my husband as we enjoyed the hot turkey plate and a pecan crusted trout.  We come here very often at this new location and are always greeted with great attitudes and wonderful customer service from the employees especially from the shift supervisor, Brenda. 
Way to go to the staff at this new location!"}
{"text":"Went here with my sister n law for breakfast. Huge portions, cheap price.  Food was good, atmosphere fair. B+"}
{"text":"This place was pretty festive since we came during the Christmas season, all the pictures that they usually have up were covered with wrapping paper that was super cool! They sat a part of six with little wait on a Saturday night so that was super nice  

now.... let's talk about the food. I'm a big chicken and waffles guy so that was what I got. Chicken done very well served HELLA HOT, burn your tongue hot and that's how I like it. The waffle was very cake like and the syrup that they used is heated so that was nice (10/10). Also tried some tomato basil soup that was pretty good nice hearty seasoning (8/10). The deserts are a great deal you get a mini pie for like 5 dollars with ice cream... spot will definitely get you feed. 

Overall, full as fuck."}
{"text":"Love eating here due to the large portions and delicious meals!
The Tri-Tip Dip has alot of flavor and tender. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Waitstaff ok, was crowded the day I visited. Food ok as well. Found the famous enough apple pie, not to be special. They serve large portions but I found the food to be just ok"}
{"text":"Great service and great food for any time of the day. Their plates are huge and you cant even finish half of them. My favorites are their hot beef sandwich and the steak and egg breakfast. I recommend to any one to try this place and dont forget to try  the pancake they have too ..."}
{"text":"I go to Black Bear every time I'm in California or Nevada. It's my favorite diner. Great food and the portions are gigantic! All with a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Terrible service we came with a large group and they told us we had to wait 20 min we waited for almost an hour when my dad asked the manager about it she was very rude and was confronting my dad implying that it's our fault we had a big group when we had come a couple of days earlier and there was no problem the hostess had an RBF the whole time and she was very rude we waited and waited while like 50 people came in and they all got seated before us"}
{"text":"So I thought I left a review for this place. Sorry I'm so late. Came here with Mom for lunch one day because I wanted to see what it was all about. Remember seeing one in Bullhead City on our numerous trips to Laughlin.

When you walk in, you feel like you're in a mountain lodge. Cool vibe. The menu is loaded with lots of options, so many that when the waitress came around I hadn't made up my mind on what I wanted.

I ordered the Turkey Club Sandwich. Man, it was HUGE!!! Along with a side of fries, I only finished half but it just meant I could take the other half home for dinner. Great flavor! Our server was amazing. Very attentive and super friendly.

At the end of the experience, Mom and I both said it reminded us of a souped up Denny's. Same type of food, but with \"bear\" sized portions! I will definitely be back to try other things on the menu. Have to have the breakfast experience! 

Oh and by the way, they have a jukebox! How cool is that?"}
{"text":"Good selection.  Friendly service.  Clean.  Affordable. Service animal friendly. Great experience of hometown cooking.  I had the chorizo scramble, my husband had the steak and eggs and a side of bacon. Both were delicious."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and generous portions of great food. Friday all u can eat fish rocks!"}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast or brunch. 

Very busy with locals so you know that it is good and not just a place where tourists stop. They have a great selection of items and the staff was really friendly. 

Will definitely look for them again while on my travels."}
{"text":"I always eat corn beef hash and eggs or the Ruben sandwich.  Other great looking stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Los devil eggs son de lo mejor, te dan muchísima comida así q el previo lo vale!!! La malteada súper cremosa, todo me gusto"}
{"text":"The food is decent but it gets spendy quickly!  Their OJ is the best...fresh squeezed, most breakfast items are very good, service is good.  The Tri Tip Dip is a must try!"}
{"text":"This place gets crazy busy on the weekends but well worth the wait. Very, very large portions and very satisfying. If you are on a diet, you should not eat breakfast here. The only problem is my husband who is a teacher always runs into his kids here which deters us from going more often. Not the fault of the restaurant, of course."}
{"text":"I mistakenly call this place Big Bear Diner all the time mainly due to the fact that all of the entrees are BIG lol Ive had breakfast, sandwiches, burgers, etc. Their food is really really good. Those Sweet potato fries are , UGH, the kind you keep eating even after you're full. Even their side biscuits are almost a full kids meal. After eating Dennys all week while in vegas, having a good meal like this made me kinda feel so much better.
I feel like everytime ive been to any BBD there is always a wait, sometimes it feels like forever- but its not always horrible."}
{"text":"I have been here once for breakfast two years ago and tonight decided to stop in for dinner before our show.  We each had the stuffed chicken breast from the smaller portions section of their menu.  It was a chicken breast stuffed with broccoli.  The broccoli and the chicken had a cheese sauce that was quite tasty.  I had a small salad (choice of soup or salad), the chicken, mashed potatoes, and grilled yellow and green squash rounds.

Dinner was quite good.  The service was outstanding!  Our server was very polite, friendly, and competent.  Even being from the smaller portions offerings, it was a lot to eat.

I like the ambiance of the place with all things bear - even the bear paw print on the napkins.  I wonder if anyone has ever counted the number of bears - stuffed or otherwise - that decorate almost every free space of the restaurant.

I'll be back!

Yelpers - mention Yelp and you get soda, coffee, or tea complimentary.  One per table."}
{"text":"The food is good and fresh. The portions are huge. Next time I'll split a meal. I ordered the corned beef hash two egg combo. The poached eggs were perfect the corned beef hash was good with actual corned beef. The potatoes were a little under cooked for my taste. I had the hash potatoes and took them home, just too much food. Their biscuits are fresh but huge! I hate to waste food but just couldn't eat the whole biscuit. I'll come again but as I said I'll be splitting the meal."}
{"text":"Sunday 25 june noon...walked in and was acknowledged immediately and friendly by Alex..Told her I wanted to sit at the bar to which she directed me...Waitresses(2) said hi immediately(beatrice) and took my order after instructing me of a no pancakes vs toast trade off...Food was quick and quality....Total  overload on the potatoes though....Great experience...Word of note.... at one point the cooks were so far ahead of the waitresses the dishes were totally piled up on the shelves...Totally awesome they could be that fast...I vlsit about every 2 weeks or so and will be back soon.  thanks"}
{"text":"My first time here and what a wonderful experience thanks to Sandor..food was delicious as was the service. Sandor was a pleasure. I loved the vibe of staff and quality of food. Sandor was most attentive..never had to ask for anything. I have been in restaurant business for 35 years and was so impressed with his service that I asked to speak to manager..she also was great. Sandor you made us have a wonderful dining experience..thank you so much."}
{"text":"This place serves a pretty good breakfast, even for being a chain. However, the service was a little reminiscent of what a normally experience at a Denny's or Cocoa's, but with better food. 

I ordered the Shasta Scramble which came with avocados, spinach, tomato, onion, bell pepper, and Jack Cheese all served with a housemade biscuit. I can't remember the price, but I know it was under $10.

The three egg scramble was well scrambled and seasoned. I liked that they did not hold back on the avocado and vegetables, especially the spinach. The sprinkling of Jack Cheese was light, but just right, and the onions and peppers still had a slight crunchy appeal.

The potatoes were simple but effective. They were cooked well with a little browning on the outside and tender inside. They could of benefited from a little extra seasoning. The biscuit was okay. It was baked to mild density and was moist. However, it's flavor was a little bland, with its spotty areas of salt. I was glad they served the biscuit with soft whipped butter. 

Service was okay. I felt our server was forcing a smile or perhaps she was just not a morning person. Anyways, she was friendly enough, but it just did not feel genuine. On the good side, we got served, ate good food, and had no issues, so that's all good.

3.8 stars is what my gut tells me.."}
{"text":"There was nothing about this experience that would make me try this restaurant again. We were sat down and didn't see a waitress for 10-15 minutes, and then after ordering immediately we weren't served food for 25 minutes. When the food finally came the country potatoes, that I ordered extra crispy, were not even cooked! The centers were cold and they tasted raw! 

The waitress said she would let a manager know, but no one seemed the slightest bit miconcerned that after we were not happy about your service or meal. 

I was sad to see this place fall short. I was looking forward to having another spot to enjoy."}
{"text":"The portions are huge and the selection of menu items is very large. There were so many things I would've liked to try. I went with the homemade corned beef hash which was mostly meat and very tasty. My friend got the Parmesan burger which was like a patty melt but was on Parmesan crusted bread. She ordered the homemade Parmesan kettle chips as her side and those were great too. Wish I had room for dessert, maybe next time."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim and an empty stomach.  The place was almost filled to capacity, yet I was greeted and seated immediately.  Quickness with my water and coffee.  I ordered a homemade bearclaw filled with apples, it was delicious and piping hot! ($4.99)  For the main course I tried the California Bacon Benedict with hashbrowns. ($9.99)  It also came with a bowl of fresh fruit.   Bene also had avocado, tomato, and spinach; the hollandaise was slightly tangy, IMO, perfect.  Healthy portions.  They even have their own brand of hot sauce with three different heat levels (Baby, Mama, and Papa Bear with habanero).  

It was, hands down, the best restaurant breakfast I've had in years.

Pricewise, you will pay similar prices at IHOP or Pancake House, and their food doesn't even compare.

The atmosphere is casual and \"log cabin-y\", with stuffed, painted, and carved bears all over.

The service was prompt, attentive, and very friendly. 

This place is aces for breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"I got the bacon cheeseburger basket with onion rings. It was good, and would be good for anyone that ha a stomach roughly the same size as their eyeballs. Good stuff. Yay!

The service was good too. Yay!"}
{"text":"They have Amazing breakfast! And the portions are huge.
But what a disappointment when we went to dinner last night. My husband had the meatloaf the portion of loaf was soo small no joke like two small pieces slam and extremely dry. The veggies where Pruny and over salted.

My dish the Cubano sandwich was also awful soo dry and salty.

I really love this place and their breakfast but there dinner last night was bad all around I wish I would have told the waitress , however I hate complaining as it is not their fault. 

Sadly they have lost my business and won't be going back."}
{"text":"Always great food & service, we drive past lots of breakfast restaurants to go to the black bear in Glendale, just had a village Inn open a few miles away, went one time, that was all I could stand, Black Bear has excellent pancakes, love their sausage."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. We went for breakfast. Service was slow. I needed to flag sometime down to refill my coffee and for utensils. The bathroom was filthy. To many choices for breakfast around here to go back for mediocrity."}
{"text":"Great service, good home style food, and decent prices. 
Collectively we ordered the children's tri tip, pot roast, and meatloaf. The tri tip was seasoned very well and not dried out despite being cooked medium well (they currently only have it available at medium well and well done). The pot roast was tender and had a good ratio of meat to vegetables with a nice brown gravy. The meatloaf was the same case, well bonded together with good flavor and mix of vegetables."}
{"text":"A great value, with good service and great food.

No huge casino to walk through. Just park and right in the door to start the only hard part of the meal, deciding what to order. Do I get Breakfast, Dinner, tri-tip, should I have onion rings or save room for their huge \"pies-for-one\"

Enjoy your decision and your meal."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been to the diner,and most likely my last,went there with my girlfriend I wanted an English muffin which came back not even toasted !!!I didn't say anything because I don't want to make a big deal out of it and I was going to order a breakfast but if they can't even tost a muffin then forget it, my five-year-old can toast a muffin, Forget this place and there was even a line when I walked out I have no idea why!!"}
{"text":"Great service. Very happy with the breakfast I had other than the pancakes were just not doing it for me. Omelette was very good and I really liked Ed their version of hash browns. Would have been a 5 for this place but the music is so loud I couldn't have a conversation with myself let alone someone else."}
{"text":"We showed up on a Sunday and it was packed with people waiting outside and inside. We decided to call in the order - the girl that answered said they have an online ordering system. I let her know that we were from Las Vegas, NV (out of state) visiting and she took our order over the phone. With as busy as they were, she took our order. We got the Scramble platter, Cinnamon French toast, Portuguese sausage, and Chicken fried steak, fresh fruit, and Orange juice. It all came out to about $50 and the food was so good. They gave us all the condiments needed and silverware. I appreciate the care and compassion received as a visitor especially when it was so busy. Great experience and we will now be eating at the Black Bear Diner in Las Vegas, NV because of the great experience we had in Arizona."}
{"text":"This place is Top Notch in service, food, atmosphere and staff.
Haven't been to a more together and \"on it\" restaurant period.
The food was at my table in less than 7 min, the entire staff was highly attentive and helpful all around the board, and the food fresh, hot, and delicious. 

P.S. I had the Prime rib scramble breakfast! 

Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"This is a better breakfast place than dinner but overall good food and very big portions but fairly priced."}
{"text":"I go to Black Bear 3 to 5 times a week,  mostly for breakfast. The food is great, I usually have the Big Bacon Breakfast or Oatmeal and fruit. What makes this place special is the staff.  Hands down one of the best restaurant staffs in Vegas.  They all just seem to get it. The GM's name is Ray and he runs a great ship. I'm a very loyal customer and would tell everyone in vegas this is the place for breakfast. Come after 730 am, so you don't take my seat."}
{"text":"Food is always good. The portion sizes are huge. They do have some items that are smaller portions if you prefer. The service is great when the snowbirds aren't in town."}
{"text":"I haven't been to one of these since we moved from California to sunny Texas.
It never failed to impress, serve good food and provide great service.
I was so glad to be able to have lunch at one of these again. Friendly staff, great food, great family restaurant."}
{"text":"Today I seen a customer with 2 prosthetic legs wait 20 minutes for a table, they told him 5 mins. Almost all of the employees were in the waiting room area. A lot of the tables were dirty and empty. When they asked for the manager and told him the whole story, He said \" I'm sorry its shift change. And I need to get the employees getting off, out, and the ones starting, on.\"
This whole store needs to be taught about customer courtesy and respecting handicap and elders. At least give him a free meal. Rather than the BS story about shift change."}
{"text":"Great food but terrible service. I was completely ignored for 20 minutes waiting to place my food order. Then when I deliberately asked to place my order the waitress had to run around to find someone else to take my order, however, she ended up taking it herself. I would not recommend this location due to disorganization and lack of service."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast with the gf and the kids one Sunday.  I heard about this place from Yelp and wanted to check it out.  I like diner eating sometimes because it's a break from so many buffet type places here.  We should have got here earlier on a Sunday, because it was super busy!  Good sign that the food is good here.  We had to wait maybe 10 minutes for a booth but no biggie.  The decor was cool, apparently they're into Black Bears...ha ha...they were all over the place!

When we got sat at our booth, we were right next to this huge machine with oranges.  I had to ask, and our waiter said they squeeze fresh juice from oranges every day.  What a trip.  Too bad it was like more than $3 per glass, a bit pricey but I guess you pay for freshness.  Their menus were cool too, printed on old newspaper articles.  

Their menu was big, and we had tons of choices from the breakfast and lunch menus to choose from.  I love my breakfast, so I ended up choosing their 'Volcano' breakfast...it's their most popular.  I got three HUGE pancakes (As big as the plate...I opted for the 7-grain Almond ones for a buck more), 2 scrambled eggs, 2 sausage links, and 2 thick pieces of bacon.  This plate was made for a king!  Wasn't bad for only 8 bucks and change either.  It was seriously one of the best breakfast dishes....ever.  Pancakes were moist and buttery, the links were snap fresh, the eggs were great, and the bacon was oh so yummylicious (nice thick strips).  This beats IHOP and Denny's any day.

Their burgers are humongous as well.  One of the kids had a Bob's Big Bear Burger, the Califoria Burger to be exact.  It's a 3/4 pound (big) burger and had avocado and jack cheese, as well as your standard fixin's of lettuce, tomato, grilled onion, and pickle.  It was too big to put in your mouth!  We had to cut it in fourths just to dig in.  They give you a huge portion of fries too, crisp and delicious.  With some ketchup and ranch, these are pretty killer.  

I will be going to this place again when I get the craving for some great diner food.  People were nice and courteous, but also quick.  Good quality and value for the dollar.  I can't believe this place is a franchise!  Sure don't seem like it with the down home charm and the unique decor."}
{"text":"Delicious, affordable, and great service. Their pancakes, oatmeal, and orange juice and absolutely incredible! This is our favorite Saturday morning spot!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and food is inconsistent. The air conditioning is so cold that your food is cold almost immediatedly. They need to lower their prices. They charged $2 extra for a piece of cheese on a hamburger. Staff is kind of iffy. It was good when they opened but has gone downhill."}
{"text":"This is our fave \"neighborhood\" go-to.  We just moved to this side of town in September and a friend recommended them for breakfast.  Since then we have become regulars.  WARNING!  THIS IS A DINER... A DINER DECORATED WITH BEARS...STUFFED BEARS EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK!  So if you are looking for a place that is super modern or Zen-Hipster whatever, then the BBD is not for you!!!

Some of my faves:
Southern Scramble- their homemade scrumptious sausage (spiced with fennel? sage? I'm not huge on sausage but this stuff is to die for) on top of their huge biscuit with scrambled eggs and country gravy on top.  You can pick hash browns or country potatoes (pick the country potatoes!!!)
Shasta Scramble-eggs scrambled with avocado, spinach, onions, tomatoes, bell peppers & jack cheese 
My husband thought the homemade corned beef hash & eggs were great! (The Bagel Cafe is his ruling stick and BBD's was a close 2nd in his opinion). 

THE BEST HAMBURGER!!!!
I have to say I have turned into a creature of habit (not of the stuffed bear variety) with their Burger Basket combo! I would choose their cheeseburger ANY day over In-n-Out, Create & 5 Guys!  EASY!  It comes with a huge portion of tasty fries which come out perfect every time I have been there. EVERY time and they taste even better when dipped into their Ranch dressing. For all you Ranch Dressing aficionados, BBD's Ranch is the real thing!!!!  I'm not sure what is going on in Vegas with Ranch dressing but most of the restaurants in town have bland, bottle-brand tasting weak-ass Ranch.  (My fave use to be Cheesecake Factory's Ranch which I use to buy to go and all Ranch is compared to theirs!)  For an extra charge (2.99?) you can order one of their hand-dipped shakes that comes with the extra in the old-fashioned tin cup-we tried the black berry...Once again, delicious!

My hubby has liked the T-bone, Tri-tip and the Prime Rib- he liked them all.  (He is not comparing them to any of the better steakhouses or anything but states they taste like the homemade Sunday dinner you use to get at your Grandma's).  

We also love their coffee and the service is always good!  Always! Expect a wait on weekend mornings."}
{"text":"I was very excited about this place and it turned out to be such a big disappointment!  The second my son, his mother and I walked in, we were greeted by the manager, whose kind words were \"Hey, two and the kid?\" So that was definitely not a good first impression. I'm a soup guy and couldn't even finish their chicken noodle soup. On top of that, my son got sick half way through his meal. At least our server was a sweetheart, that was the only good thing about my experience at black bear diner, which sucks because I grew up going to a lot of diners back east and I was so stoked about having a diner around the corner from me. Oh well..,"}
{"text":"This place is all about the paw 
From the wood carved statues of black bears at the entrance down to their sugar packets, the bears and paws are everywhere. The woodsy outdoor environment is accompanied by country music in the background while you eat. 
Very friendly staff that took great care of us.
We were greeted, seated and had drinks in less than 3 minutes on a busy Saturday morning. 
You can choose between counter service, table or a booth for seating. 
Fresh brewed coffee and iced tea. They had different flavors of creamer for the coffee, we had the French vanilla. 
I ordered the cinnamon roll French toast...YUM! I wish I had room for another order. I had agreed to share before the food came and I wish I hadn't because it was so good. It doesn't really need the syrup, but it tastes good on top. Bacon was cooked perfectly. 
My guy got the big bear (10oz) chicken fried steak, red potatoes and biscuits for his over easy eggs. Chicken fried steak was great. We doctored the gravy a bit to add more flavor. Eggs were cooked correctly and the red potatoes with veggies were great. 
Our server Angela was very attentive and took great care of us, we never had a need for anything. 
We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"My first time to BB Diner, for dinner for 2 with my 27yo son. No reservation. This was a walk-in. I thought It was good service! We were greated & seated, no waiting around. Our server brought out water and menus right away. Looking around at the decor loved the bear and reminded me of being in a log cabin.  Everything from matchup to hot sauce says s Blackbear Diner! Server was attentive snapped a few pictures of us after we ordered and it came out the way we ordered it. So it was very nice. They made sure we had a good experience. Soup was hot and very creamy. His salad was cold and had greens and tomatoes, son said dressing tasted homemade. The main coarse' were chicken fried steak for my son  and I ordered the lighter main dish of stew served with mash potatoes green beans sides were delicious. I would highly recommend what I ordered."}
{"text":"My wife and I love Black Bear diner! The manager Don is very nice, funny and makes sure everything is going well. The servers are friendly and attentive and the food is amazing! We went for thanksgiving dinner 2017 and you can not beat the value for why you pay and it was all so delicious  we just moved to the Las Vegas area and this is our go to restaurant! I'm so glad to see that good service and good food and making you feel at home still exists!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim not knowing what to expect and only skimmed a few reviews that said there were big portions. So I thought, cool. Game on. 

We came here for dinner and the food was sub-par at best. I ordered the chicken parm meal with a soup and mashed potatoes with gravy. The soup was a clam chowder soup that came out warm, not hot and tasted like it came from a Campbells soup can. So ok, that was bad and I moved on. The corn muffin was probably the best thing on my plate which is why this place is getting 2 stars. The chicken parm tasted like bad ketchup mixed with Prego. It was SUPER red. So cheap and gross. Definitely not homemade. The mashed potatoes and gravy were the worst. Like, how can you mess that up? I'm pretty sure everything here is formulated from some mixture that just needs water added to it. *ahem* the potatoes. The meal came with a side of penne pasta with that ketchup-prego mix smothered on top. I hated it so much that I only took a bite. 

My kids ordered burgers and never ate them. Huge shock since they have great appetites.  My other kid got stuck with with a chewy chicken fried steak and those darn potatoes that he couldn't eat. My husband didn't finish his pot pie and munched on his 5 onion rings the remainder of the evening. 

These were not huge portions by any means. Maybe folks need to venture out more to see what real \"huge\" portions look like. 

Food was terrible and all the workers looked like they were sad they worked there. We were disappointed and will never be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic place to have breakfast.  The food is good comfort food and the portions are generous. The only reason I didn't give this location 5 stars is that the waitress was seldom around to refill our drinks.  The Black Bear in Las Vegas gets 5 stars for everything they provide: great service, tasty food, and the huge portions. If you want the pleasure of Americana meals  then come to the Black Bear."}
{"text":"Food took forever. Poached eggs were not great, huge portions but overall the food was not great. Basic diner with underwhelming dishes."}
{"text":"Giving this place 4 stars...really like the quality of food and the price. I ordered the chicken strip sandwich and while I wouldn't order it again, it was good. I was really impressed with my boyfriends chicken fried steak. Good prices. Only didnt get 5 stars due to the service. We had no forks, didnt get offered refills and our server seemed stressed and forgot to bring something I ordered. Was still a pleasant experience, though. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Love this place, always fresh, great environment! Amazing big portions when I'm feeling extra hungry"}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place! It's very cute inside, service was really good and food tasted great. I had the turkey club sandwhich w/a side of fries. My boyfriend had their black bear burger w/a side of fries. Both of us were completely satisfied. Cannot wait to go again and try more of what's on their menu."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service! My boyfriend and I went for dinner, I kept saying that I wanted to try it,  and we finally decided to go. So glad we did. The food was so good, and the service was the best we've had in a long time!! So much food, and the prices are great for the amount of food you get. We eat out quite a bit and to find a place right around the corner from us that serves comfort home cooked food this may be my new favorite place. I'd go there just for the service! Ask for a girl named Flower,  she was the sweetest! Since I don't have a cracker barrel near by this would be the cracker barrel of Vegas. Be back soon for sure!"}
{"text":"Loved it! I got the chicken fried steak with fries and my fiance got the fish and chips. The soup was amazing! Everything we had was wonderful. Large portions and very tasty. Our server Anthony is an excellent fun server! Love the music and atmosphere. We ordered pies to go! Looking forward to having those later. We recommend and will be returning!"}
{"text":"Lunch is nothing to brag about, but breakfast is gggreat! The Hobo omelette with a side of cottage cheese."}
{"text":"I will preface this by saying I am very critical of breakfast restaurants. Staff is very friendly and on point at all times. The look of the place is fun too stuffed bears fill a small shelf that trims the interior. Carved bears and cute chachki gifts for purchase. I am a firm believer that if you have a signature dish it should knock me over, or at least be something I will talk about. Black Bears trophy meal is Chicken Fried Steak (also one of my guilty pleasures). Firstly get the freakin orange slice, parsley and plastic portion cups off my plate (All these things just say Denny's,IHOP). Eggs were cooked right, Hash Browns were good, Chicken fried steak was just OK. It is panko crusted gravy was not very flavorfull and I got a lump of flour or whatever they thickened it with. For me to not finish a Chicken Fried steak is a big deal. The other diner had a Choriso,Green Chili, and Cheese Omlette. My first bite was a sinuey grissel and cheese that was spicey. Not the best Choriso I have had. The Coffee here is so weak that I didn't even finish one cup. I ordered milk when it came the plastic cup smelled like dish cleaner and was still wet? This place is driven by an older crowd and that explains the weak coffee and bland food. Not the mediocre choriso though. This is also a chain so the recipes are not changing, and from the 20 min. wait to get in why would they. This is more from the lack of enough Rock Star breakfast spots, than a salute to the quality of Black Bear itself. As of yet Hash House A Go Go and some select casino spots are still holding the top spot by a large margin.  I am gonna give them 3 stars this is driven by the ambiance and service."}
{"text":"I came here twice for brekky in just one weekend alone because the first time blew me away.  Had the homemade corn beef hash and a side of an 8oz thick-cut ham.  Portions are huge!!  I didn't know how i finished most of it, but i managed.  Also best stripped hash browns i've ever had.

My second  time I had the breakfast plate with everything: 3 eggs, 2 sausage, 2 bacon, 2 pancakes, stripped hash, and a 4oz cut ham.  That was a challenge. I went home shortly afterward and threw up because it was too much food :X

Come here if you want to feel like family surrounded by great comfort food."}
{"text":"This place is so cute kid friendly . The food is really great plus if you download there app and become part of there club you get a free black bear paw and a coffee for free.  Great service. Staff was really friendly to thank you ."}
{"text":"Great service and wonderful food. The waffle was so dreamy. I got a scramble with pickled jalepeno and tortilla strips. So good."}
{"text":"Visited Black Bear Diner on 1-7-14.  It was kid's eat free night so it was very busy.  8 of us so we sat in two booths back to back. That worked well.  
Good food - Lots of it - Priced reasonably - Good Service except for the refilled drink that didn't come back for quite some time.  
Yes I'd go again
Yes I recommend it to others.
It is a favorite of my nephews who live in the area... glad they picked the place for our meal!"}
{"text":"This is another must stop when I come to Vegas each summer. The Bigfoot is the only thing I get. Awesome chicken fried steak and scrambled eggs that are delicious and more than filling. Solid service even when it's busy which it usually is. Thanks for the good eats !"}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with black bear. Great family atmosphere and have you seen there biscuits!"}
{"text":"good portions, tasty food, great service. The menu isn't fancy... simple fare done simply well. Sandwiches, soups, pies, and breakfast. I like coming here when we go to Vegas when I'm in the mood for something homey and not over the top."}
{"text":"I was so excited to go to eat here. Several friends have been raving about it. I will say the food was plentiful and delicious. My reason for a low rating is that the service (IMHO) was below standard. We waited more than five minutes after being seated to even be greeted for a drink order. I looked around and it wasn't busy. Having been a server before, I felt it was too long to be greeted and offered a drink once we were seated. I noticed one of the servers asked all the tables around me if they needed anything (once we had our food), but walked right by us. My glass was empty and a pile of plates from pre-meal were sitting waiting to be taken. It would appear that the servers are only focused on their tables. My experience has been you ask all in the area if you ask one. It was as if blinders were on. I was disappointed in the service and will give Black Bear another try. It could have been the day or time or location. However, the food was hot, fresh and more than plentiful."}
{"text":"Heard so much about it in the positive.   Went this morning.  $4.50 for orange juice. Our breakfast with tip for two was $40.  Eggs dry, grilled toast, not toasted, potatoes not done.  Place was packed but being our first time, very sad.  Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Service kinda slow.   Anthony seems like a super nice guy just took a bit to take my order.  Get my food and he never checked up on me to see how it was tasting.    Again super nice just needs to hustle more."}
{"text":"This has got to be the best country breakfast ever. The service is good, they treat you like family. We had the country fried steak and eggs. The portions were huge, and there was a bigger portion on the menu. I myself had the rib-eye steak and eggs. The food came out fast and fresh. The biscuits were like pillows of goodness. The price was spot on too. For a big breakfast away from the crowds of strip try this place you will love it aas much as we did."}
{"text":"This is the breakfast you are looking for. Coffee was great. Food was great. French toast and pancakes sweet and fluffy. Maple syrup with no corn syrup. Huckleberry syrup to buy in lobby. Friendly faces. Good energy. You won't be sad walking out of here. Full and satisfied"}
{"text":"Amazing food for a great price! And their hot sauce was so good, I HAD to buy a bottle! I got the Mama Bear Chipolte Hot Sauce! Their Reuben sandwich was one of the best I've ever had...my hubs got the Grizzly breakfast & he loved it so much that he ALMOST ate it all! Our server was fantastic and it was an overall a great experience! Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. We had a fantastic server named Shannon. Told her it was our first time and she did a great job explaining the specials and her favourites. We could tell she loved where she worked and recommended what she truly loved so we let her just order for us. She suggested the omelet special with pancakes. They were both amazing. Pancakes are a must have. Overall great service and great food. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We were seated promptly. Kelsey immediately took our drink order and delivered our drinks equally fast. I had the Volcano and my son had an omelet. The food was excellent. Kelsey was attentive. They have some diet/healthy options on their menu, which I like to see. This is my first time at this location.  I have been to their Glendale location many, many times. Great food and service. The prices are reasonable, as well."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place after reading a Yelp review on a friend's FB. I went with my hubby on a weeknight and had to wait about 20 minutes to get a table. The server was nice, but I wouldn't call her attentive - drinks were empty for quite some time before she ever noticed and didn't check how the food came out until it was time to offer to bring our bill. 

The food itself was definitely home cookin' style. I ordered the chicken fried steak and it was pretty good - no complaints (but also not the best I've ever had... a bit too crunchy). 

Honestly, I probably wouldn't go back unless someone else really wanted to go. Wouldn't be a place I'd think of for a good meal."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Black Bear Diner. It's our must stop on the way out of Vegas. HUGE breakfasts!  Try the chicken fried steak and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a great diner. The staff has always been friendly with my friends and I. The food comes in huge portions and a great variety on the menu. I'm partial to getting something like chicken fried steak, but they have a little of everything. Sweet tea was also very tasty.

Love how the menu is a newspaper. Just adds to the ambiance and theme. Overall, love eating at this diner."}
{"text":"We went in at 5:00 pm to have dinner. There were 4 tables already served. Two more tables were seated after us and 15 mins later they had their drinks had been delivered and we were waiting to have someone come to our table .   We didn't get any service despite the fact twi waitresses told us someone would be right with us. Poorly managed"}
{"text":"Wow, went on New Years Day. What a way to start off the New Year, with a great tasting breakfast. Discovered the place on Yelp, we were visiting from Ca.
Plain and simple, you gotta go there, my group tasted each others plates and everything was good. The fried steak with gravy and house potatoes was awesome. On the side was biscuits and gravy. Ohhhh!
Anyhow we definitely enjoyed trying the Black Bear and will go back the next time in Vegas Baby! If the had one in the IE, I would be there daily. Until then Fight On!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Good service, great food, large portions and decent prices! If it's your birthday you also get a free mini pie!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!! I got to go here for breakfast and it was so good. The place is filled with bears, bears everywhere. From the chainsaw carved statues outside to the teddy bears lining the walls, there is even a little carved bear near the register you can have a \"Kodiak\" moment with. 

I had the meal tittled \"The Grizz\" and for 9.99 it was a sweet deal of two sausages, two strips of bacon, three eggs, a piece of ham, choice of potatoes and two pancakes. While the meat was good and the pancakes were really fluffy, the potatoes were a little bland. A couple shakes of the salt and a squirt of ketchup took care of that. The coffee was also very rich and I loved that the table came stocked with flavored creamers. 

I wish this place was a little closer to home because I'd be here every week. There are so few decent places for breakfast in this town and this place just rocks. The service was great, everyone was very friendly. I am a cinnamon roll junkie and as I was leaving I spied one in the front case bigger than my face. I'll be back to conquer one of those bad boy. I've got a new favorite breakfast place. I can only imagine the rest of the menu is just as awesome."}
{"text":"Staff was really great here. Family friendly and plentiful portions. I like an all day breakfast spot so that's what I got. They have four different hot sauces which is unique. They botched splitting the check but they offered to fix it so that's forgivable. Glad to visit a regional chain that we don't have in the Midwest."}
{"text":"They just opened this week.  As with their other locations the food and service are good.  The only difference is there are no  lines and no 30 minute waits for a table.  Once people know it's here - that will change.  The portions are big so come hungry or consider sharing."}
{"text":"I love this place and the big portions!  Great for breakfast!  Be advised there is sometimes a wait on weekends."}
{"text":"In all honesty, I would give this place 3.5 stars, but since I can't, I am rounding up.

The place was clean, and adequate.  Actually liked the bear theme, and it had sort of a log cabin feel to it all.  The service was friendly, though the wait for the food was a little longer than expected, considering it was nearly empty. I ordered the special: chopped steak with onion and mushrooms, with mashed potatoes and green beans.  My girlfriend ordered the turkey dinner, with the same sides.  Both tasted pretty good.  Portions were not overly huge, but more than a large chain.  Definitely better than a Denny's or similar restaurant.  The banana cream pie was good, too.

I will return.  Nothing bad to say about the place.  Just didn't totally blow me out of the water as amazing, either.  A solid place to go to."}
{"text":"Food is good, wait time after ordering is Ridiculously Slow! Restaurant is Half Empty. This is unacceptable. My boys got there Burgers and no French fries. Had they started eating they would have had the fries for desert. Still waiting on biscuits 10mins after my breakfast came. Would/Should be a Great addition to this area. Please Fix these issue. I revised my review up from 2stars. Manager went the extra mile to ease my aggravation."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I've been going to the one off Dysart Road for a couple of years, so I was happy when they opened one down the street from me!! Their eggs Benedict will change your life and their omelettes are awesome! Great service too!"}
{"text":"Awesome awesome spot, especially for breakfast!!! The portions are huge so make sure you wear sweatpants or loose fitting pants!! I always get the Eggs Benedict with country potatoes! Yummy!! The service is always friendly! If you're ever in there area, I highly suggest a visit!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Grizz Breakfast!!  Everything was delicious.  Best breakfast I've had in a while!!"}
{"text":"I have stopped in at this location a few different times after work on my way home. I have never been disappointed the food is great. Always hot and fresh. Service is always fantastic they truly go above and beyond to make sure you have that warm and welcoming experience and that have a wonderful visit. A must try place. Get the Chicken Fried Steak its delicious and take your self home some Banana Cream Pie you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is quantity over quality. I was expecting better from all the positive reviews.

The line cooks don't know scrambled eggs from an omelette. Burned/overcooked and no curds.... I got Mexican resort fold-over eggs instead of scrambled.

Boring chicken fried steak patty. Bacon was gamey.

Pancakes  were too sweet. Didn't need any syrup. Kids will love this part!

The service was decent even though it took a half hour plus to get mediocre line-cooked short order items. Probably the last time I visit a BBD.

The thick-cut hash browns were okay and are the extra star in this review.

Cut our losses short by letting the waitress know our displeasure in the meal and not sending the food back.

Bill came to $33 for 2 adult and 1 child's breakfast, not including $6 tip. A bit expensive when there are plenty of other more popular options."}
{"text":"Out of all the swanky and upscale spots my family and I have visited and\or frequented over the years, this Black Bear is one of my very favorite places to go. We live in the neighborhood and come here about once a month and it feels like home. 
The service is amazing and consistent, everyone is always so friendly if just a couple of us, or the whole fam. The food is awesome, the menu is everything you would expect from an old school diner, simple food cooked by someone cares. The burgers are always great, the sandwiches are as well. The breakfast is damn near perfect, I don't think my kids have ever even tried anything else due to this, and we usually eat here at dinner time! 
I usually try different things when I eat here and have recently found my hands down favorite, the Blazin Bear! Pulled pork with their special spicy sauce that I had a hard time believing wasn't candy, it was just so good! I grabbed the waiter after my second bite to tell him it was amazing. He was grinning from ear and was almost excited telling me it was his favorite thing on the menu. Even the cole slaw on it tasted great....and I detest cole slaw!
They also have great dessert, the pies are all pretty tasty. The coffee is pretty good, too. Kids eat free on Teddy Bear Tuesdays, our kids even brought in Teddy bears the first time we went on that day and they are still up on the shelf after the years. 
It's great to have an old school neighborhood dinner actually in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place in the valley. The portions are huge. The service is awesome. My kids love all of the bear decor. I took some out of state guests and they raved about the diner too."}
{"text":"Walking in to hear Hank Locklin sing Please Help Me I'm Falling. Enough said. Good grub."}
{"text":"We got an email invite to the reopening after the remodel.  I have to admit I was sad to see the stuffed bears go, but the remodel is amazing! The room is more spacious and opened. They kept the jukebox and the tasty desserts in the front cabinet appear to be the same!  We noticed that all of the old staff was there which was great.  We were greeted and sat immediately even though very busy.  Menu looked about the same.  I ordered the classic Benedict was delicious!"}
{"text":"They need a Black Bear Diner on the east coast.  The sweet cream pancakes were unbelievable and unlike any pancakes I've ever had.  I don't think the calories in the pancakes would allow for visiting more than on a special occasion, but it's so worth it."}
{"text":"We had about a 45 minute wait at Black Bear but very well worth it.
We enjoyed the dinner.  Always wanted to try chicken and waffles.
The food was great.  Service not great but not bad.  We chalked it up to being new.
Nice to have another choice for dinner!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here twice now and both times I'd label as a mediocre experience. Mediocre service and mediocre food. Disappointed by their Chicken & Waffle dinner entree. I'm sure I'll find myself in a Black Bear Diner again in the future. Just later than sooner. 

Peace and Love

{"text":"The boyfriend and I were looking to branch out from our usual breakfast haunts but the minute we pulled up to Black Bear Diner we should have kept driving to The Farmhouse in Gilbert. One look at this place and we should have known this was not gonna be great.

Black Bear Diner is pretty much a bear-themed Denny's. I ordered the \"small portion\" breakfast and boyfriend ordered pancakes. My small breakfast was 2 eggs, a huge portion of hashbrowns, a gigantic biscuit and bacon. There was nothing small about this breakfast. The menu said for seniors and smaller appetites. They've got some hungry seniors in Gilbert apparently.

The eggs were tasteless and the bacon was meh. The hashbrowns were good though, I'll give them that. Boyfriend's pancakes were also flavorless and really thick and heavy. Nothing light and fluffy about these flapjacks. They were kinda like a brick with syrup.

We left feeling like we had wasted our weekend breakfast. Maybe lunch or dinner is better but I don't think we'll be back to find out."}
{"text":"Due to the service and breakfast selection this place gets 4 stars. I ordered the 2item breakfast combo with Bacon and my brother the same but with Country fried steak. My bro said the country fried steak was seasoned well but slightly over cooked. My food was delicious, especially the hash-browns. Had a minor mishap with my food but the management fixed it right away. Thanks for breakfast."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday for dinner, wasn't crowded at all. Only took like 5 minutes to get seated. Our waitress was very nice and helpful since we have never been to a black bear diner before.

I got the French toast and a side of 1/2 biscuit n gravy. This biscuit was home made and big for being a half size. The gravy was to die for! The French toast was very good :)  he got the pot roast and it was the full size. It was a lot! I mean my husband is a good size man lol. Also we got the Parmesan chips and coffee. All was delicious! I will be going back :)"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my wife and a friend and were greatly pleased with everything about this place!  Let's start with plenty of seating, great service, large portions, and reasonable prices!  
I'll definitely make plans to bring family and friends here when we're in town!"}
{"text":"This is my families favorite place to grub. The portions are huge. The food is delicious. If your a ranch lover like me don't miss out on the bacon ranch dressing. Super yummy for dipping fries in. My husbands favorite is the chicken fried steak. Mine is the burgers. Try this place...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We are locals here (part of the year here, part elsewhere).  We eat out every single day. We recognize that the restaurant business is a difficult and tricky business to achieve success in. We eat in divey out of the way places and in high end restaurants (think Hank's in GVR).  It is with this in mind we write reviews.

We \"discovered\" the Black Bear Diner accidentally and we are very glad we did. To be clear, this is in the \"Diner\" class of restaurants and as such is terrific.  It started in Shasta California and now is a chain of 80 diners.   It is what it purports to be - a terrific diner and nothing more . . . comfortable seating, great service, good food at very reasonable prices.

The menu is extensive with an incredible array of choices.  The choices are typical of diners - great breakfast selections (pancakes, waffles, eggs, omelets,chicken fried steak, massive biscuits, salads, large burgers, sandwiches, etc.), substantial lunch and dinner choices.  Portions are big and filling.

On this visit, I had a 3 egg omelette and seasoned potatoes with a huge biscuit is big enough for two meals.  My wife had the Shasta Scramble which was equally large.  Tasty and plentiful!  I'm a big eater and I still took home 1/3 of my breakfast.

We have and will continue to go back . . . . and will bring a very healthy appetite with us."}
{"text":"I have been going to Black Bear Diner since I was a little kid going to breakfast with my parents. I recently took my best friend for the first time to eat here and she loved it ! Of course their breakfast is the best ! The delicious, crispy bacon down to the big and fluffy biscuits this place will always be a favorite breakfast spot whenever I want something yummy and affordable !"}
{"text":"Biscuits were Huge! And sooo good, and fresh. Loves the menus! Fun facts and a food menu all in one. Enjoyed my Vegetarian omelette!"}
{"text":"Fresh squeezed OJ mmmm. Great prices for plenty of food. Went for breakfast all went well and food great. Pancakes are 4 star, thick bacon great, huge biscuits!"}
{"text":"Not my old favorite. We used to love this chain. We are not happy with the menu changes,  and the quality and flavor are not there. So very disappointed."}
{"text":"Rediculous!!! Was told there would be a 25 min wait, which was hard with our special need twins, but instead we waited over 45 minutes, meanwhile 2 tops were walking in & being seated, spoke to the \"manager\" who was rude & wasn't willing to put 2 tops together! Needless to say their food might be good but who cares with that wait & attitude, you can get breakfast anywhere!"}
{"text":"This chain is always nice to stop and eat at once and a while. The food portions are huge and I like the options as well as the orange juice maker they have behind the bar. The prices do feel high especially for breakfast foods.. The atmosphere reminds me of walking into a bed and breakfast or cabin in the woods. Overall, enjoyed my time there."}
{"text":"Was a little upset with our server she didn't seem to have it together. We waited a while for service and she was not attentive at all. I think her name was Cherie. Since it is mother's day I still gave 5 stars because it was busy. All the other servers were doing great and weren't as frazzeled aa she was. The manager was so friendly and came and talked with us. Over all the food was delicious. I had the chicken avocado sandwich. It was great. Big portions as always."}
{"text":"Love BBD! The food is great and the servers are always polite & courteous! Our Masonic lodge (Acacia Masonic Lodge No. 42 F&AM) is right down the street and after meetings we'd get a group of about 7-10 guys and have dinner. BBD and server's were always welcoming, will and able to accommodate. Try the 5 dollar milkshakes! They're the best!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this diner on Yelp as my family and I drove in from California to visit Las Vegas. We arrived just around 9AM on 12/26/17 only to find that it was slightly starting to get busy. We got a seat at the bar and was helped right away. 

This place was definitely a traditional diner with mom and pop style food ... meaning portions were HUGE. The menu was creatively printed on newspaper, paper and folded like newspaper. Very cute!

I got the breakfast special which was steak and eggs that day. It also comes with potatoes and toast. I ordered my son the chocolate chip pancakes with a side of hash browns. My husband ordered one of the breakfast plates with a side of pancakes. His breakfast plate came with eggs, bacon, sausage and a biscuit. 

Now let me tell you... these pancakes were the size of my head. They were huge! Delicious too! Everything tasted wonderfully! The steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly, eggs were delicious and the potatoes were more like a hash and it was probably my favorite to eat. My husband raved about his sausages - said they were the best sausage patties he had ever tasted! 

Overall, we had a great experience. After we placed our order, service seemed to slow and it took longer than expected to get our food but that did not stop us from enjoying our time at Black Bear. If we are ever on the west coast, we will surely find a location to stop in! 

***Update: Just found out that Black Bear is coming to Katy, TEXAS! As native Houstonians, we will surely take the drive up to dine!"}
{"text":"Not going back to this location! We did have good service and the place was very new and clean! But our food was cold, we waitress ask how we were we said our food is cold and my eggs were over cooked. She took it back and brought it back well eggs still over cooked and potatoes was warm but not crispy like hash browns should be. Nope won't be back!"}
{"text":"The waitress was very attentive and friendly. The carpet was filthy with trash. They seated us at a dirty table so we moved ourselves to a clean booth. Don't order their burgers unless you want a lettuce, tomato and onion sandwich. The burgers were wafer thin, undercooked and tasteless. The fries were the best part of the meal. We've tried this location for breakfast and dinner. Both meals were fails. Overpriced mediocre to lousy food."}
{"text":"Met 5 client's here for breakfast on a Tuesday early am. The restaurant is located on a corner and has their own private parking. I heart the decor inside which had a mountain cabin feel to it  - cozy and quaint. We were seated in a quiet corner which was perfect for a business meeting.

After receiving our coffee and OJ our friendly waitress took all 6 orders.
I went with the chicken fried steak wirh potatoes, eggs, biscuits and gravy. The portions of food here are ginormous and even the biscuits were massive. I only ate half of my entrée and half of 1 of 2  biscuits & gravy.  My clients breakfast plates were huge and satisfying.

I would definitely return here and recommend breakfast."}
{"text":"What a sweet place to stop in. There is definitely a bear theme decor. Though it's a chain, you get this mom and pop feeling. The staff was so sweet and friendly. We got coffee and breakfast.  They knew we were in a time crunch so they helped bag things up. They have french vanilla coffee and the chicken sausage is unique and delicious. Black Bear Diner is a place you need to check out in Phx. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner is a nice local chain to have a change from the Denny's and IHOPS of the world! It has a family setting feel and is near themed, as AZ is known for its Black Bear habitants. The service is fun, up beat and accurate. Our waitress was very patient with the kids and tending to their needs. I had egg whites and toast with fruit, very filling, my bf has a chicken fried steak which he enjoyed. The menu is like a newspaper and it filled with a simple menu of appetizers, breakfast, lunch and dinner. The kids meal is also concise. The orange juice is fresh squeezed and delicious! The restaurant was clean and environment is comfortable with a cabin feel to it. If you are in the Phx area, grab some breakfast or brunch at Black Bear Diner. I thought the price, experience and food was a nice place for out of towners!"}
{"text":"I've been to many different Black Bear Diners. This one is just like the others, the food is good the service is good and the atmosphere is good.
We had breakfast, everything came out in a timely manner, the food was hot, including the potatoes and there was plenty of food to be had. My eggs were not cooked as long as I like but, that was minor.
We had the Country Fried steak breakfast. We also tried a bear claw, that was very good. Plus the service was great.
Not sure what some of the reviewers expect, this is a diner not a 5 star restaurant. As for the guy, who gave it one star because he couldn't take his free meal to go, that is a normal policy at most restaurants."}
{"text":"Awesome service! The owner was VERY nice and accommodating to us. Constant checking in with to make sure we were good. All the servers were very polite and accommodating as well! The food was very good as well! Will definitely come back! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service as always.  My breakfast was 10 out of 10 good.  I got the Portuguese sausage breakfast with sunny side eggs and sourdough toast.  Of course, I had to add a wheat pancake on the side because they are tasty!  My waitress was great and made sure my coffee cup was never empty. The restaurant has very cute Bear décor and dining area and restrooms were very clean. 5 Stars."}
{"text":"OMG! Love the sweet cream pancakes! Can get pretty packed and wouldn't recommend all the dishes but the pancakes are a must have!"}
{"text":"Not a good experience. We wait over 15 min for one of their empty booths on a Tuesday morning with no one else waiting. We are finally seated and wait over 7 min for a server to come over. No one came so we got up to leave. As we did, the manager had nothing to say about any of this. Rude hostess, rude manager and no server. Great way to start a birthday."}
{"text":"Food was good. Priced just right. Lots of food. However if you go with a group of 10 to 20, there are no reservations even though we knew there were no reservations we called day before for a heads up. That didn't work. We waited more than an hour to sit down. First waitress was rude, was pissed off it seems she had to put several tables together.. The one that took food and drink orders made up for it though she was super. Served quickly after seated.  Big portions. Real meat not processed. Sausage looked  and tasted hand made as well as real ham and homemade corned beef hash I was looking even tasting other peoples food. Good place no reservations."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast.  Pancakes are wonderful. Great service. When we are in Vegas there are a few places we don't miss and this is where we come when get off the plane!!"}
{"text":"Always looking for a good diner. I love it here. I will definitely take the ride to again and save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"I was in town with  several coworkers from all parts of the country. They all heard of Black Bear, but never had the opportunity to dine at one. We had breakfast and when the huge delicious plates arrived, my guests were all highly impressed and satisfied. What really made this experience special was our server, Jenny. Talk about great service!! Jenny was engaging, sweet, fast, and fun. She truly made our visit memorable. Lastly the GM Ron spent time with us and really made us feel welcome. I highly recommend visiting this new Black Bear Diner!"}
{"text":"I have been to one other Black Bear Diner a couple of times but was rather unimpressed. Tonight, however, I am happy with my meal. I got breakfast for dinner which, if you ask my family, they'll tell you I am not a breakfast person. It is rare that I eat it. But every once in a while I get a craving for corned beef hash. So that is exactly what I ordered. I had not tried it from here before so I did not know what to expect. I was not expecting all the options for sides. Most of which contributed to potential carb overload. 

What kind of potatoes? Pancake? Waffle? Toast? Biscuit? What kind of eggs do you want? The answer, for me, was home style potatoes, a biscuit and sunny side eggs. 

My food came out fast tonight but tasted overall fresh. The hash was amazing. It was full of corned beef that was recognizable as such along with small diced potatoes. The potatoes in the hash made the side of home style potatoes rather redundant. For that reason I packed the home styles home for later. The eggs I mixed in to the hash. I like the yolk to run throughout the meat. As for the biscuit, OMG, it was a fluffy monster of a biscuit. It was a great biscuit and absolutely huge. If that is what they use for their biscuits and gravy then I will be back for that.

Yes, tonight I had a good breakfast for dinner sort of meal and even brought home some leftovers. For a total of $11 and change, not a bad deal. The Black Bear Diner in Green Valley has given me a new perspective of the chain and restored my faith in their ability to give me a good meal. I'll be coming back again."}
{"text":"Black bear dinner is so cute and the food is great!! Portions are huge , service is fantastic . What else could you want? We only tried food off the lunch menu , next time we need to hit up the breakfast menu and see how that fares"}
{"text":"The first time I saw a Black Bear Diner was in Yreka, CA. I did not get the chance to stop and was kind of upset. So I was excited to find one right here in Las Vegas. Last fall I tried it for the first time. It was busy and I figured that was a good sign. Service then was alright as was the food. Nothing spectacular. I don't really remember what I even ordered. The place did leave enough of an impression on me to sign up for their email club. I get periodic offers from them though I never take advantage of these offers. Black Bear is not in my area of town. Today, however, I was in the neighborhood and feeling like lunch time was upon me. So my roommate and I stopped in. We were taken to the seating area quickly though our table was not cleared yet. We waited while they cleaned. Our drink order was taken right away and by I think three people. All very friendly. It took several minutes to look through the menu and our server had to come back a couple of times. I almost ordered the corned beef hash and eggs. I went with the tri-tip dip with potato salad. My roommate ordered the pulled pork sandwich with cole slaw. Our food took a little while to come out. No matter though, it was busy after all. Both my roommate and I thought the same thing about our side. It was kind of bland. Neither of us finished our side. My sandwich seemed very familiar. I think it was I ordered during my first visit. It was not overly memorable this time either. The au jus seemed watered down. The beef was mostly tender. The Swiss cheese was great as were the mushrooms. The onions were supposed to be sauted but they were still mosly raw. I don't like raw onion so I picked most of them off. Nevertheless, it was filling. That is a bonus. As for the service after the food arived, it was lacking. I had my empty glass of tea on the edge of the table and was walked passed by our server several times. My refill came after my meal was finished and my plate was gone. I don't think I'll be back any time soon. It has been almost a year between visits and I imagine it will be at least another year before the next. I think I would like to try their breakfast sometime. Corned beef hash is still on my radar. Only time will tell."}
{"text":"Food is great and down to earth.  Portions are large and the daily specials.....what a deal!  We keep going back."}
{"text":"Food, disgusting and dry the service was worse our server was very rude and inpatient. She took forever just to come and greet us then when she finally did come over she was rushed us to order. The food came out dry and Bland. She not once came back to check on us even though she checked on everyone else around us. Her and one of the managers laughed and stared at our table making us feel very uncomfortable. We eventually end up flagging down one of the busser to get a to go container. Never thanked us for coming or invited us back. I don't do the whole race thing but yes I am African American and sad but true this restaurant tend and treated everybody else with kind respect based on their skin color... smh I have been to the one on flamingo and had never experienced this kind of service. Do better and stay humble every guest experience matters from the 1st sale ever to the last one of the day."}
{"text":"Impressive! 

The bacon is better than Cracker Barrel (that says alot). Great brewed iced tea, server was great and the manager was hustling and talking to customers.

A great spot for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Our first time hearing of Black Bear during our west coast trip. So glad we chose to do breakfast here! The portions are huge, the food is delicious, the prices are very fair, and all the employees were extremely warm and accommodating! 

The milkshake end led up being the size of two shakes, with all the extra they poured in an additional cup for us. The scramble entrees are huge and the pancakes are amazing - soft, moist, sweet cream pancakes!

Also, the menus are newspapers! Adorable. They refashioned some articles from a 1955 issue of the Las Vegas Sun, and sandwich the lengthy menu options with fun articles about bears and Vegas."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! The atmosphere was great. Only thing that did make my experience at black Bear Diner was our waiter. The bill was given to us before we could even eat . I asked for a refill and she just walked passed us multiple times I had to get up and ask for a refill to a different waiter. Sorry to say, other that than it was really good"}
{"text":"This place is so cute. We were looking for a place to eat and stumbled upon Black Bear Diner. The staff from manager on down greeted us so friendly and explained all the goodies at the restaurant. I had to try the bacon cakes pancakes made with sweet cream. Even the menu is so cute. It looks like a newspaper. A must visit when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Awesome traditional diner food. Breakfast is amazing dinner is great also. My 3 year old daughter begs to go to this place to see the huge bears. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here with my husband and he liked it more than I did.  I thought it was really just ok.  The food, the service, the restaurant itself - all meh.  Definitely not somewhere I'm going to feel a need to go back to any time soon.  There are a ton of much better places to eat here in Vegas, go there instead!"}
{"text":"Only giving this place 2 stars because the food was just ok and comparable to ihop but nothing spectacular. My wife and I visited here the first time today for breakfast and we'd decided to share the grizz before even getting there. Upon arrival it seemed pretty busy in the parking lot and when we walked in it didn't feel comfortable. As an African couple the first thing we noticed was the patrons were all Caucasian, not an issue but we wanted to give it the benefit of doubt since the reviews were favorable. We were immediately greeted and sat at a booth where a waitress took our drink order and told us our waitress would be there in a few. Since we already knew what we wanted there was no need to look at the menu. About 7 minutes later our waitress named Candy arrives after tending to a few other tables and asked for our order in a very dry and forced tone. I didn't get a friendly or good service vibe by the tone of her voice, more of a \"you were sat here and I have to wait on you\" vibe. As a former waiter I've worked with people like her and know how the game goes. We ordered the grizz and just sat and observed how Candy treated all of her surrounding tables, she was friendly and gave casual conversation. Until she brought out our food was the next time she came to us. No type of check in like \"your food is coming soon\" \"how's everything tasting\" NOTHING!! We asked for a second syrup and she said ok 5 mins later I had to flag her down for it and it was obviously she forgot or ignored it bc she didn't apologize for not bringing it the first time. All in all we didn't feel welcome at black bear by Candy and it felt like we weren't deserving of the service she gave her other tables. Maybe because no other guest there had our skin color is the only reason I can think of. Customer service is top priority in the restaurant industry and we did not receive that at black bear. We will never return or recommend."}
{"text":"Well, Let's see. My friend and I walked into an almost empty restaurant. Plenty of tables available. There was one party of four before us. We waited a while. My friend thought perhaps we were supposed to seat ourselves. Finally a waitress told us we would be seated after the party of four was seated. Okay. Then we asked for a booth. We were taken to the far corner of the room to a table that should have been designated a children's table. I could hardly get seated between the table and the booth. We asked for another table and even though there were empty booths available, it seemed like the waitress was having a hard time with seating us. Okay again.... Then we ordered. My friend ordered trout and it was delicious. I, on the other hand ordered turkey. We were told the veggie for the day was broccoli and I am not permitted to eat it so I asked for a replacement. The waiter said he would replace it with cole slaw. Fine. The meal came with the broccoli. I told the waitress who brought the meal about my discussion with the waiter. Next thing I know, the manager is at our table asking what the problem was. We explained. Then I looked at my plate. OMG! There were three slices of turkey on my plate. Each slice was about 2 to 2 1/2 inches thick, and it was very, very pink. The last piece was the end piece and it had white stuff on the end and it was hard. The cole slaw cup was filled so high that when I entered it with my fork, the cole slaw fell all around the table causing me embarrassment. After the dinner the manager did come to the table and offer to take my dinner off of the bill, but I refused. We've been to the other Black Bear Diner on Tropicana and the turkey dinner was prepared perfectly and it was delicious. I think perhaps these young folks in this diner need a bit more practice. They are all very nice, but there needs to be some sort of improvement, and sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"We usually love this place. However, today, we waited well over an hour for our food. And that it's not counting the twenty minute wait to place or order. We watched three different couples sit next to us at the counter, eat and leave before our food even came up. When it finally did, my order was up but my husband's wasn't even started. The waitress tried to blame the kitchen staff, stating they are new and training, but we've been eating here for a long time and the cook has been there since the beginning. On top of this, my food wasn't cooked right. I've never had such poor service here. We ended up leaving and going across the street to Ihop. Hopefully, they can manage their time better."}
{"text":"There's a nice, homely, country feel to this diner. We went around 10 am and it was not a wait to get a seat at all, which is great because there are a lot of brunch locations in Phoenix that get packed in the morning.

I absolutely love and cannot live without coffee, and I have to say, their drip coffee was perfect. It was not piping hot, or lukewarm, but just the right temperature to give you that warm morning coffee feeling. It was not bitter and it still had a good kick, so they definitely know how to brew a good cup. 

The menu has variety, and apparently you can order anything off of the lunch or dinner sections for breakfast if you want, which definitely opens up options. I don't know if folksy is the right word, but that's how I felt about the menu, which is printed on a newspaper and added some extra charm to the place.

I got the Mushroom and Spinach Eggs Benedict, Baked Red Potatoes and a side of Corned Beef Hash. And everything was delicious, and even though the corned beef looked fairly pink, the taste was on point. The Arnold Palmer was also in perfect proportions. 

Lastly, the staff and waitress we had were very friendly. I really look forward to going back again."}
{"text":"Love the food and service at Big Bear. The steaks are high quality for the price. Breakfast all day. Large portions and friendly service. I will go here as often as I can. Definitely a Valley go-to breakfast, lunch or dinner fix!"}
{"text":"Love. Love. Love this place. Great food. Good value. Portions great. Recommended to leave room for dessert..."}
{"text":"First time ever at this concept.
Food was delicious and the wait time was well managed during a busy Sunday lunch rush.
My choice was from the breakfast menu and was solid; the homemade biscuits are legit.
My son had the tenders from the kids menu and they were average while my daughter had French toast and they looked great.
Service was pleasant and April took great care of us; she checked on refills and was personable and efficient.
I might just make my Sunday brunch place."}
{"text":"I love Black Bear! We were stuffed on our cinnamon roll french toast, eggs, bacon, biscuits & gravy, and pancakes, on our platters, not plates. The service is always great, fast, efficient & the food is amazing. You just might want to share a platter. I always want to roll myself out of there after I'm done cleaning my plate."}
{"text":"Being local and living near. I have eaten here on several occasions.  Service is normally good but on occasion we have lingered I believe our server started avoiding coming around or making eye contact.  Coffee refills stopped and we got the impression we were getting the signal to leave.   Otherwise I would have given 4 stars.  Food is comfort type average to good."}
{"text":"If you would like a little something to take home how about SALMONELLA?  Was in last night about 8PM.  Friendly greeting, immediately seated, lots of help.  This is the first time myself and my husband had been here.  Hubby ordered chicken & waffles, I ordered biscuits and gravy.  It seems like our food was at the table in a flash.  My biscuit was stale and hard on the outside, and doughy and a little raw on the inside. Gravy was tasteless.  I sent it back.  Hubby's waffle had a weird texture. Very soft and mealey, but he ate it.  Chicken was a thinly pounded breast and heavily breaded.  He eats some of it, and then I looked over at him and I said, stop eating it.  It is pink and undercooked. So now hubby is annoyed at me because I sent my food back and now I want to point out the issue with the chicken.  He goes in the car and I am left to address the issue. Upon checking out, the manager discounted our biIl.  Personally if I was the manager the item would have been removed from our check. I don't want anything for free, but in this situation that was the appropriate thing to do.  While I know they are still working out the bumps in the road because they are new, serving improperly cooked chicken is absolutely unacceptable. I give them 1 * because of the health danger that was present in the food, even though service was very good. I went back and sat at the counter.  I was sitting about 10 minutes before I was acknowledged and I placed by order, 2 pancakes, 2 bacon, 2 eggs. About 5 minutes later a man sat down next to me and ordered the California benedict. About 6 minutes later the man next to me got his food. What's going on here?  Finally my server is back in the counter area with a plate of food that she tells cooks this is the wrong order. She brought it to the table and the diners told her it was wrong and then she puts it in front of me! I immediately told her I will not eat it.  She tried to say they didn't touch it.  That might be true but I don't know if they sneezed or coughed on it.  Really at that time I should have left, but I was hungry."}
{"text":"Great service and all the waitresses were kind! 
Food was good.
My only complaint was the hash had no potatoes in 
Corn beef hash!"}
{"text":"The next best thing to the diners I loved back home in NY.  Excellent food and service...gets very busy but worth any wait.  Best eggs Benedict in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The Menu is rediculous, everything from pancakes to fish tacos, portions are huge and is a good price, I suggest the chicken wrap...yum!"}
{"text":"Decent food, good service - and long lines!

Recommended!

This place has only been open a couple weeks, and I was eager to give it a try, despite the mixed reviews. Three of us ventured here just before noon on a Sunday, so it was no surprise that we had to wait. They told us it would be 40 minutes, but we had a table in a little over a half hour.

Food:
I ordered Joe's Hobo Omelette, and it was really good!. I prefer low-carb, so I substituted cottage cheese instead of the hash browns and biscuit. The omelette was huge, with lots of meat and cheese. Definitely not for the cholesterol-watchers! I also enjoyed the three types of hot sauce to spice up my Joe's Hobo. The Papa Burn has habanero, so it's spicy! But it's flavorful, too. The Mama Burn and Baby Burn were less spicy, and each had its own character. I suggest you try them all and decide what works best for you.

While the food was good, my friend ordered a side salad which included the \"butt\" (or core) of a head of lettuce. They should be more careful to omit these from their salads!

One thing to note: Yelp doesn't yet have a link to the menu, so try this:  https://blackbeardiner.com/menu/breakfast/

Cost:
My meal, with no drinks, was a reasonable $10.80 including tax. Considering the amount of food, I'd call this a good value.

Service: 
Like I said, they were really busy! It took about a half hour to be seated, and once we ordered it was another half hour before our food arrived. Our server was personable, and checked back on us often, so there's that.

Atmosphere:
As others have said, the decor is reminiscent of a hunting lodge. But I have to say, it's a bit kitschy, not at all authentic. Still, there's a lot to see while you wait...  :-) 

Overall:
The food was good, so I'd like to give this another try when it's less busy."}
{"text":"We stopped on our way to Quartzsite and had a pretty good meal.  A cross between a family diner and a truck stop diner.  No frills, no fuss but food was good.  The bear claws looked great.  It said to send a text and you could get a free bear claw.  Sent the text but never received the code....No bear claw for me.  :/"}
{"text":"We came to Black Bear Diner after viewing the dismal continental breakfast at our hotel and boy am I glad we did. Tarissa was an excellent waitress, friendly, smiley and quick and the food was amazing. The cinnamon roll French toast was some of the best breakfast I ever had! The side of potatoes I asked for was huge! If you're so hungry you could eat a bear, then black bear diner is the place for you. I loved the cute touches they put on the decor and various accessories of the restaurant. The menus were newspapers, and there was etchings of bears in the wood posts!"}
{"text":"The food was OK, won't give it a higher/better score. Service was good and very efficient. Prices seems to a bit pricy for what you get but I guess this is how it is these days."}
{"text":"The burgers, meat loaf, pancakes, and steaks are all awesome! The service was even better. We had Debbie tonight and she was fast, sweet and knowledgeable! Very fun night."}
{"text":"I live in Illinois and ate at the diner while on vacation last year.  I love it!  They had a steak and egg special that was enormous and delicious. The staff was very friendly and made the dining experience great.  
I visited Arizona in February of this year and after flying in wanted something to eat.  We decided we wanted to go back to the Black Bear Diner. Again we were not disappointed.  The food was as good as I remembered.  To my amazement the waitress remembered us from our last visit.  I am probably more critical than the average customer because I am a waitress. 
Keep doing what you are doing because it's working!

{"text":"Really nice place. The waffles, eggs and coffee were delicious. The portion size is perfect. Bacon was good but very crispy which I like but others might not. Seating and food wait wasn't long but I ended up having to flag down the waiter for the check when we wanted to leave. Bathroom is also in need of some upgrades, there was a leak coming from the sink. Apart from that it's a nice place to have breakfast."}
{"text":"This has been a favorite place of mine for food for while but after peering into the kitchen today I will not return. I watched a team of \"chefs\" with zero gloves on, arranging food on plates ready to be served......I even witnessed one scratch their butt and proceed to touch the food!!!!! This is how food borne illness and staph infections start! You would think a restaurant that takes the time to homemake their orange juice would take the time to ensure their employees practiced food safety 101."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Black Bear Diner! Every Time I go there I leave satisfied and stuffed! The portions are huge and the ambiance is very cozy. I loved it! I got two pancakes, with two sausage links, with scrambled eggs, and a side of hash browns. The pancakes are scrumptious!!! They are to die for! The sausage links were ice cold so I didn't touch them. The eggs were fluffy and the hash browns were awesome! I am a coffee lover so when I tried theirs I fell in love! It was so good I got 3 cups! Black Bear Diner always has fresh ingredients that taste home cooked along with HUGE portions! So be prepared when you go to eat ALOT. The service was good as well. Overall just a great experience!"}
{"text":"The staff was great even the manager was getting involved. Our waitress was Brandi super sweet really enjoyed our visit and the food was amazing. LOVED it."}
{"text":"Good place to eat, has a homey feel to it. Had their chicken and waffles. Enjoyed them. Quite a bit of variety-comfort foods,  traditional American cuisine, and a little bit of down home cooking.  Love that all items on their menu are served all day. They get really busy (evidently a popular place), so be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes or more for a table depending on time/day."}
{"text":"Each time I go to Vegas, I try to make a stop at this local diner - for great Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner... At reasonable prices - not necessarily good if you don' have a car, though..."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast - fresh squeezed oj! Yum!!  The food was perfection.  The staff were super nice and the service was great.  We went back the next day and they were super busy but still did a great job."}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner has continuity!  And its a life saver when you are traveling with a bunch of people on vacation.  There is always a wait for breakfast (that they serve all day)  But the wait goes pretty quick.  The restaurant has a cabin look with everything bear'ish.  

Wait staff is busy and on their toes.  Food came out in a timely manner and drinks we refilled without asking.  The one waitress whos section we were seated in was all business, not too friendly but got the job done.  

I got huevos rancheros and it was pretty good!  Dude got a clubhouse sandwich and he said the turkey was really good.  Our friend got the California benedict (just added avocado) and she loved it.   Happy full tummy's and great prices!"}
{"text":"Diner was a little busy for a Saturday lunch hour and had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated but was worth the wait I think. Menu had lots of options to choose from and breakfast is served all day. The price wasn't bad considering the portion size. Orders were correct and food tasted great. Biscuits and gravy were huge and did not disappoint. Will likely make this the go to breakfast joint when friends and family are in town."}
{"text":"Usually, I would hate this place.

Every ounce of my body hates the kitsch.  Bears, everywhere. The napkins, the walls, the poor high school kid in the bear suit, all of it. Even the plates.

But their food is amazing.  The breakfast is filling, flavorful, and the variety is astounding. 

From scrambles, to skillets, to steaks, potato pancakes, and pie, this place has everything one needs for a good breakfast.

What is an added bonus is that their food isn't greasy. Time and time again I have been to plenty of places with greasy food, and the Black Bear has constantly kept up great food.

Definitely worth going, over and over again.

However, I have never tried anything but the breakfast."}
{"text":"Sat for 15min. Nobody even made eye contact. Service is terrible. Several different servers walked right past."}
{"text":"Was here recently and not totally excited the first time. This time sat at the counter two waiters at the food window and they kept doing their thing not even acknowledging me. Anyway I want to be short and not get to deep with this but couple things that confuses me : breakfast is served with Italian sausage?, and not a breakfast sausage?
The gravy was bland and the biscuits so so. 
Service at the counter is minimal almost would be more efficient to low wall the server area and put in3-5 two person booth and assign to a waiter. 
Just my thoughts"}
{"text":"The jury is in, and the verdict is very simple.

Food quality is above a Denny's, Coco's,Blueberry Hill, IHOP,  and most eateries in this category. The portions are very generous, and the quality of the ingredients is very good. 

However, as the saying goes, \"You Get What You Pay For\", and in this case, they are bit pricey.

Other than \"sides\", or just having something like Coffee, you can't order almost anything on the Menu, less than $10. That includes a basic breakfast, or a meal quality sandwich. 

The servers are good, and aim to please. 

Bottom line; skip Blueberry Hill and find one of these Diners. You might spend a dollar or two more on your meal, but the portions, quality, and service, are worth the extra money. Only real drawback, is they close at 10 PM, so that excludes them from late night and early morning meals. 

Judging by the above referenced class, the Black Bear Diner is in a class by itself."}
{"text":"The sweet cream pancakes here are absolutely delicious. This is my go-to place for pancakes. So far, the best I've had in this city. I sit and daydream about these pancakes during my off-time.

Other food is traditional fare for a local diner: They taste as expected and food is generously portioned. They should have a little something that should satisfy any craving on their menu.

It's a bit weird eating a meal with surrounded by hundreds of stuffed bears lining the ceiling though. All of that creepiness  is usually  forgotten once that sweet cream pancake hits my tongue."}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner rocks..the food was VERY good and plentiful. Our waitress Christine was Awesome! She made sure we were well taken care of for my daughter's birthday. Great example of customer service.Thank you to all the staff there"}
{"text":"We are so happy the Black Bear Diner has landed in Laveen. Food has always been great and the service is always friendly. Breakfast all day, light sized meals for options and a wide range of food to please everyone. Thank you for coming to Laveen!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for an affordable breakfast joint with hefty portions and great taste then you've come to the right place. Their classic diner food is absolutely superb and without a doubt the best tasting breakfast you'll find in Henderson. Try the hungry grizz or the scrambowl if you're looking for a protein filled breakfast. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. I always recommend this place to friends and family that come into town and once they've experienced this place they always beg me to take them back."}
{"text":"I have no idea what they put in these pancakes but they are the best in town. Farmer boys pancakes are pretty good, but these are even a step up! And the best part, they sell breakfast all day! I have eaten here quite a few times and have never been disappointed. Wife loves their burgers and kids meals were decent as well."}
{"text":"If I could marry this place. I would. Great coffee. Exceptional service and AMAZING pancakes!! I would eat here every day if I had the money."}
{"text":"Why is everything here so good!? Seriously make my way down here every time I'm in Vegas for good reason. Tried the prime rib scramble with hashed browns and it was very delicious. The portions are huge & worth the price. The servers are so kind and personable. I strongly recommend trying black bear diner! Wish they had an LA location"}
{"text":"I've been to Black Bear Dinerseveral times and I love their breakfast, but don't really care for their lunch or dinner.  Their breakfast are nice & hearty plus great tasting.  This is one of my favorite breakfast stops.  Their homemade sausage patties are must have & the pancakes are nice and fluffy."}
{"text":"1st time here.  Sat at the bar 2 see all the food coming out - everything looked great.  I had 2 eggs over easy with homemade sausage patties (amazing!) + hash browns & my wife had 2 eggs scrambled, crisp bacon, country potatoes & a mile high biscuit.  The bacon, biscuit, hash browns & sausage patty was best we've had in East valley.  Great food, excellent service + great price.  Our new favorite breakfast place."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It's corny to the degree of charming and hometown.  And the food is always predictably good.  
There is something for everyone; from burgers to salads, biscuits and gravy, good pancakes... it's all good.
My only comment is their menu which is made out of old newspapers.  It is a little messy."}
{"text":"I came here on 12/28/16 around 930am. It was quite busy but me and my friend decided to wait anyway. As 30mins passed they called the person who came in right before me so I obviously knew i was next. Then they seated a part of 1 which I wasn't mad about. Then they seated 2 party of 2's and a party of 3, completely skipping us. The person who was seating people was the manager. I asked him kindly why did i get skipped and he said \"i called that name a long time ago and nobody showed up.\" Mind you, me and my friend were stand right in front of the check in area the ENTIRE TIME! So i told the manager that and he insisted he called us. So me and my friend looked at each other and was like ok screw it. The manager seats us and asked for our drinks, i asked for a orange juice and quick he says \"we have none.\"

I dint know if he did it in spite because i know they do sometimes but i was real disappointed with the service. I usually love black bear and that location, but i was upset about how the manager handled things, really unprofessional."}
{"text":"Nothing but excellent service and food.  Of course,  we avoided the weekend rush and glad we did. Breakfast portions are HUGE. The biscuits are delicious. Mikela was a great and happy server, kept our coffee cups full.  Great job."}
{"text":"A great family place with huge portions.  Fresh is best and that's what's served.  No canned food here.  Our server, Amanda was very pleasant and helpful with menu choices.  Our host was very accommodating when we wanted to change our seats.  Next time you're in Tempe, AZ and looking for some good old fashion comfort food, come to the Black Bear Diner."}
{"text":"So a while back I frequented this chain.  For what it is, it's aight.  Way too expensive.  Breakfast places always rape people's wallets.  The portions are cool but for the past few years I've primarily been vegan and there is absolutely nothing here.  For vegetarians there are few dishes but they don't compare to the signature dishes.  There really isn't anything special here besides the music they play.  I dont recommend coming here.  4 stars for 80% of the places on yelp are all for ambiance and hype.  The service was alright.  Can't complain, but servers here don't hustle during rush hour.  I'm not gonna visit any of the locations.  Any longer unless these things are resolved."}
{"text":"A must try. The place is clean, we had a great server who was very helpful & attentive. The food portions are amazing & everything has a homemade taste."}
{"text":"All the positive reviews about this place are true. The food was fresh and very good. I love the fact that they have homemade corned beef hash that's not out of a can. I was extremely impressed by the service - the servers were very attentive and friendly. I look forward to coming back to Black Bear Diner."}
{"text":"I have to admit I have only been here for breakfast.  The chicken fried steak and pancakes are a win!  The omelets are great.  We have been about 6 times and every time has been great."}
{"text":"Love the chicken fired steak at this place... Share a meal they are large. The manager was top notch here... His name is Rod..... Great experience...."}
{"text":"Great coffee and great food! Their California Eggs Benedict is my ultimate favorite and I love that I can go on any day and different times and the food is always good. Hello avocado! Hello bacon! Customer service is great and they are always busy so you know its good stuff!"}
{"text":"Great find for our recent move to Vegas. Me and hubby have been twice this week for breakfast! I had the bacon cakes which huge delicious pancakes filled with little chunks of bacon definitely get bacon in every bite! Hubby got the Grizz which has bacon, sausage, ham, eggs, hash Browns and pancakes it was too good didn't get to take a pic either time definitely will be one of our regular places for weekend breakfast"}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if I could. I been here once before my 2nd time (today). It wasn't that great the first time but thought well they just opened so maybe that's why. I got there and waited a little over 5mins with no host in the front. Dinner time. Anyway today I ordered a chicken noodle soup as that's the only one they had(I asked if they had any others). It is NOT home made, it's Campbell's thick and hearty chicken noodle soup. Everyone should know what canned crap taste like. Then for the entrée I ordered fried chicken thinking it was home made and fresh...oh and \"juicy\" as stated on their menu. It was luke warm and dried out to the max I couldn't even cut it with a knife! You probably could have thrown it at someone and hurt them pretty bad.It tasted like it was bought from a grocery store and warmed up. It was awful! The mashed potatoes were cold with warm brown gravy (im sure wasn't home made either). Good grief! Does this place know anything about home made food?? Obviously not. I would've got a better meal across the street at my favorite chicken place. Take your money and time else where."}
{"text":"We visited this place for the first time on a Wed night at 6:00 pm. For being a new establishment, it was disappointing to see carpet that was already stained and torn (not sure why those chose carpet which I think is just gross but...). When we walked in, it smelled like mold and pee and we were not even greeted by staff, someone walking by said we could find a seat. We sat down in a booth. We were not impressed by the menu at all and within 5 minutes decided to go next store to Wendy's and spend a fraction of what we would have spent. Maybe the food is amazing but couldn't get past the run down look and bad smells. Bad first impression Black Bear."}
{"text":"Great service!!!! Outstanding service! Tons of food and love the mountain feeling decor. The food was way more than we thought. Could not see any free space on my plate.This was our second time to a Black Bear. Easy location next to the outlets. Had breakfast with the largest biscuit I have ever seen. Fresh OJ and beef hash. We will be back!"}
{"text":"It was amazing diner with my family. The portions are huge and the price is worth the amount if food. Our waitress Rebecca was amazing and attentive. She was helpful and very polite. It was one of the best experiences I had black bear. I recommend Rebecca."}
{"text":"This Black Bear Diner has exceptional food (portions are large), the quality of food can not be compared to any other restaurant in town. The wait staff are friendly and chat with you. Whether you are a gourmet or a gourmand of food or eat like a sparrow or have a lumberjack appetite, you will not be disappointed. It is the best restaurant in Glendale. Kudos BBD, keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This place was awesome ! 

It smelt like a real diner when we walked in and they certainly delivered on that smell ! 
The burger I ordered was juicy and the fries with it were just what I was craving ! 
The service was amazing. The waitress was totally in her game that afternoon! 
Loved the lodge atmosphere and our daughter loved the wooden bears throughout the front ! 
Oh and the cool juke box up front she went nuts for ! Great for kids and families and very well priced ! 
Love it when we find awesome places like this !


Keep it up guys we will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"We love this. Diner we have been to two different locations. And both have met or exceeded our expectations . 
It's nice to find places like this '
Family friendly clean and the food is well prepared and too order ! 

My daughter loves all the bears around the facility and she loves the juke box as well !

We will continue to be patrons of black bear diner ."}
{"text":"Went here with the seniors for the first time on a Sunday afternoon. Reminds me of a Perkins except where Perkins doesn't suck. Very disappointed. The waiter walks us to our table immediately and before we even sit down, or the rest of our party arrives, asks us what we want to drink. Can we get within five feet of the booth first? Jeez. Food is adequate, basic, and not worth the cost they are charging. Both burgers were cold and the waiter didn't take it off after we said something. Had to get a manager. Won't be back here again"}
{"text":"I was so very disappointed at our recent meal here. First of all, there is a huge staff that is absolutely horrible at their respective jobs. Nobody seemed to know what the heck was going on. Multiple times we had to search for our waitress. The register seemed to have three employees up there when no one was paying, yet when someone needed to pay their bill, staff was AWOL. I had to find the manager to get a refill on my coffee after asking other staff members three times and ask for some apple slices that were not brown. Yes, my granddaughter's apple slices were brown. My fried chicken was burnt and my daughter's huevo ranchero was covered in chopped tomatoes, not the salsa that she ordered. Our entire visit was just over two long hours. Never again!"}
{"text":"Good food and fun atmosphere. Eaten here many times and I always enjoyed my food. But they put bacon in many dishes. Some people cannot eat bacon due to various reasons. That would be nice to know ahead of time."}
{"text":"The food here is by no means top-notch in comparison to some of the heavier hitters in Phoenix. However, since most breakfast establishments close in the early afternoon, there aren't many choices if you develop a craving for some eggs, bacon, and pancakes during the evening hours. This is where Black Bear comes in handy.

For convenience alone, this place is a far better option than going to Denny's, IHOP, or Village Inn. The portions are generous and the food is always acceptable. The first time we ate here, we ordered some pancakes that ended up being surprisingly good. We've concluded that the creation was a \"fluke,\" as the pancakes have yet to be duplicated on our repeated visited. Not that they're ever bad, they just weren't as high quality.

Although usually full at the end of the meal, we did try one of their coconut cream pies once, which ended up being not as bad as I had feared.  

Servers are always friendly. One guy was very insistent that we try his special French toast buttery dipping concoction, which he described with much enthusiasm. Funny, that you often get the nicest servers in the most unlikely places.

Food is decent, prices are cheap, and the portions are fair. Although I maintain that, for this area, you can get a better breakfast at U.S. Egg a few miles east of here, it's still a respectable option for after-hours breakfast enthusiasts."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed ourselves. Our waitress was friendly. We try to come here at least twice a month. The sweet cream pancakes are my favorite. The chorizo is also very good. Portions are big. Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Since I'm not a big fan of pancakes I have to tell you this place makes some marvelous pancakes.  Made with real cream -you can taste the difference.  Deliciousness.
And they're big too.
This is a darn good breakfast place so if you come during regular breakfast hours on the weekend I'm pretty sure you're going to encounter a crowd as well as a wait.
Servers are usually pleasant, skilled, and efficient.  Food coming out of kitchen seems to be consistent.
Parking lot is iffy, but c'mon,  that seems to be the only bad.
You want some tasty, comfort food?  Give this place a try."}
{"text":"I have seen potato's cooked so poorly.

Hash browns (sliced potato, black, and ice cold)
French Fry's (black, limp, ice cold)
Country Style (black, lack of season, ice cold)

I like my potato's HOT and cook in clean oil not ten week oil (maybe they are microwaved)?

sooty"}
{"text":"Went at lunch time and was seated quickly.  Our waiter arrived and brought us drinks quickly.  For food we went with the taco salad and bacon/cheese burger salad.  Portions were very large and the was good.  For dessert we went with the bread pudding which was incredible.  Good service, good food and a unique atmosphere."}
{"text":"Always passed by going or coming from our spiritual day....packed every time.  Finally had a chance to go ..and wasnt disappointed. . Good food and the steak was cooked perfect... thank you to the skilled cooks and chef... also to April our waitress. ..GOOD EATS!!"}
{"text":"Arrived here around brunch, so we ate breakfast. The time our food came was after a while. If you like all biscuits with no gravy then you came to the right spot! It's a nice place, the atmosphere is very 80's. However, I must mention it is super cold from the minute you walk in. The servings were big portions for the price. Not a bad place, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat breakfast here. It is possible that we will return in the future, but for now. It's your average diner, simple country food with a simple price."}
{"text":"Omg  stay clear of this place the service is so poor we waited 30 minuets for our food when people came in after me and my family but received there food before us and get this the manager Jennifer served this people Jennifer was just sad and no helpful at all the only nice person in the whole place was bob thanks bob . After getting home my daughter checked her account and the cashier Maria added a tip on the bill with out our permission I will be calling corporate office and I will never visit this place ever again stay away....."}
{"text":"Had to have some work done on my car and the dealership recommended Black Bear. I'd never heard of it, so hubby and I reluctantly walked over to give it a chance. So happy we did! Great atmosphere, great people, our server was spot on (even though there wasn't an empty chair anywhere) and the food... I've used a lot of words to describe food at restaurants, but i'm almost speachless on this one. Just like sitting at my Mom's table, it was that good! Homemade, fresh, local ingredients. Both of us had great meals and did not leave hungry!"}
{"text":"Gooooood but NOT as good as Glendale Black Bear Diner. Best multigrain pancakes EVER! I've never met or seen an unpleasant customer so it's always a pleasure to sit next even the naughtiest of small Children because they are busy stuffing their little face full of delicious food HECK it  buys you enough time to enjoy your own meal! Leaving full & satisfied! This Army girl appreciates the military discount  HOO-RAH!"}
{"text":"Nice little place down the street from our house. The service is always great specially when we get Tara. The food is really good and the portions are very filling."}
{"text":"Outstanding breakfast. Definitely  good meal service is quick. Allow plenty of time because there's always a wait for seating on the weekends"}
{"text":"What a great place off the strip. We were heading out to the Grand Canyon and wanted to hit up something quick with a nice breakfast. Found this gem few miles away from strip and right off the highway. 

We were greeted and seated very quickly. The staff were very chippy and nice to not only us but literally everyone walking in. The menu is created and shaped like a newspaper - Genius!

The portions are huge here, you could share dishes or be selfish and have your own!

We ordered Fit & Focus Chicken and Apple Sausage Scramble - came out fresh and hot! Very healthy option to pick and it tasted very good.

We also ordered the Ham & Cheese Omelette - It came out hot and fresh and cheesy! 

Didn't care for the hash browns. It was not crunchy and too soft for my liking.

The best part of all of this is that damn BACON!!! Get it on the side, it compliments with your meal or by its dang self. Very thick, smokey, and just amazingly delicious."}
{"text":"This morning a work colleague and I dined at the Tropicana location. The colleague is an Asian woman who has been in America for thirty-eight years and has been working in customer service for the entire time, conversing in English. She told the waitress named Jenny that she wanted a veggie omelet Jenny said \"a what?\". My colleague then said a vegetarian omelet. Again, Jenny did not understand and looked at me as to say I don't understand. I told her that she wanted a veggie omelet. At which time Jenny the waitress said \"I cannot understand her\". It appeared to me that Jenny was not making any effort to understand as my colleague does have a very, I say very, slight accent. It appeared to me that Jenny has a somewhat racist slant. Later my colleague asked for extra napkin. When Jenny delivered the napkin she sort of tossed the napkins down in somewhat of a irreverent way Unfortunately, I will not be dining at Black Bear diner again."}
{"text":"So the wife and I decided on a whim to head to BBD for breakfast a couple sunday's ago. What we discovered was the same great food, with better service. I don't know if they have the friendly staff come in during the weekend mornings, but our waitress was the most friendly and attentive we have had at BBD. So even though they are not always on top of their game here, there are shining moments."}
{"text":"Great ambiance , so cozy and very clean restaurant! The food is really good and the prices are very affordable! Service is great too !"}
{"text":"Staff is super cheerfully and attentive,  I draw k my coffee and the waiter is on point with filling it up the second I get low.  I had the steak and eggs and shit was amazing.  No wait at all,  food came out very fast.  Place looks pretty cool,  menus an old newspaper from 1957 so that's pretty tight and there's bears and shit everywhere.  Place is bomb, check it out if you  want  a quick good meal."}
{"text":"AMAZING BISCUITS. Stopped here on our way out of Vegas for our last meal. Perfect choice! Everything seems to be made in house, down to the sourdough bread. We walked right in and were seated immediately. We ordered the Bear Breakfast (french toast, 2 eggs, and bacon) and the Godfather omelet. Both were some of the best breakfasts either of us have had. French toast was perfectly cooked (not eggy) with a hint of cinnamon and the omelet was stuffed full of veggies and sausage and a marinara sauce on top.  The portions were huge. We'll definitely make this our pre-15 Fwy meal every time we're in Vegas from here on out."}
{"text":"I really want to rate this restaurant higher because I love it.  The Bear theme is cute, the log furniture is cute........

BUT.....

It never fails that I always seem to encounter a server who doesn't want to give me service.  I will admit that I can be a picky customer, but asking for my salad to be made out of romaine instead of iceberg lettuce isn't a big deal is it?  Asking for a waffle breakfast that comes with eggs and hash browns shouldn't be that hard to get because this is a diner isn't it.  I'm listening to servers tell me why I can't order what I want and I'm just looking at them asking myself if they are kidding.  Who doesn't at least TRY to accommodate their customer?  

Anyway I like the strip hash browns so much that I keep coming back just for them."}
{"text":"its very hard for me to give anyone a 5 star but I considered on this place.  Settled a 4+ in my books.  We have been here 3 times now and the service has been most excellent all three times.  Fast and friendly.  The portions are very large and the food is excellent and surprisingly quick.  I have had the Shasta Scramble (I couldn't finish it and I am a big eater), the Sourdough Melt and the Turkey Club.  I have also tried the fries and the Parmesan chips.  I enjoyed all 3 meals. 

This place is a keeper!!!!  I hope your visit is as enjoyable as mine have been.  I also believe they serve breakfast lunch and dinner all day.  Prices are along the lines of everyone else in this area."}
{"text":"We love this place for breakfast. Not so much for lunch or dinner (unless we order breakfast items). The food is good and the portions are big.  

Not so good... the pies, which is very disappointing. I mean, you walk in and the pies are right there in front of you and you say to yourself, \"Ooh, I'ma get some To Go on the way out\" (because you'll be too full with your meal). So you get 3 and can't wait to get home and eat them and it's a flop. I'm looking at you, Peach Cobbler, Banana Cream Pie, and Lava Cake!  (The ice cream that came with the Lava  Cake was good, though.

Tip: Weekends are super-busy and the wait-time can be long; so get there early, or eat a little beforehand so you're not hangry and yelling at the staff (they're very nice)."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, place just opened, kitchen staff is still learning. Lady at checkout was awesome. Hostess should have set an elderly couple with disabilities in a larger booth, instead she sat them at this tiny booth, when many large booths were available. Good food portions, large and delicious!"}
{"text":"Mom and pop restaurant! Has been around town for a very long time! Great portions and great food! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I came in a few weeks ago. The wait time wasn't bad. We waited maybe 10 minutes. The server was strange and after awhile seemed scared or embarrassed so this is what happens. We sit down and look over the menus. SO MANY OPTIONS. 10-12 minutes later we have a server stop by for drinks and right when we barely said \"we are ready to order\" he walked away. I had to motion him over to come take our order. I ordered French toast and SCRAMBLED eggs.  My boyfriend ordered some sort of Benedict. Anyway, we got our food and it was a fired egg over easy. I let the server know I asked for scrambled (easy mistake) he made a statement \"are you sure you want to change it?\" And yes I did. I know it's weird but the only way I can eat eggs is scrambled. Anyway this is when it got worse. We never got a check back on food. My boyfriend and I were done eating and waiting for the check and when the check came the server realized that the eggs never came and brought them after we cashed out and my man was leaving a cash tip on the table and the server didn't apologize. I'll give it one more shot but that server we had was completely clueless and the service was less than satisfactory :( but the food was delicious so I give it that."}
{"text":"My bf and i went there for breakfast. The food there was really good i order the hobo omelet and everything was cooked perfectly.  Our waitress was so nice and friendly I think her name was Angela. She had multiply tables and still attentive to all of  them next time i go back i sure home i get her again."}
{"text":"Like to go there for breakfast as they do have some of best home made corned beef hash in the areas. Went there this morning at 7:40 and sat at the counter as always. Two servers on duty and both could not been more helpful. Had the hash with two eggs. 

The manager was there then came in what seemed to be the district manager. Did I mention there 3 customers at that time. 

The two managers talked about the placement of new bags they got in. They each must have walked by me 3 times and never said a word. 

I guess they were that busy. Really poor customer service. 

My waitress Danielle was very nice."}
{"text":"Disappointed in Black Bear today usually the food is really good but today the bacon was overcooked the toast was soggy and the potatoes were hard"}
{"text":"The food quantity here is very good and you get your money's worth. I ordered the Southern Scramble and was not impressed. This basically consisted of Black Bear biscuits covered with sausage, restaurant egg product and packaged gravy mix. I remember thinking I have the same package gravy mix in my pantry right now, hmm? If they would of added some customization to the gravy mix it would of tasted....special. The best part of my meal was the fresh squeezed orange juice. I think I could actually taste the orange zest from the rind in the juice. Maybe not but it tasted fresh. I also had coffee which was super strong. A little too strong for my liking. I had to put 3 creams and 5 packets of sugar and it was still too strong and it was only an 8 ounce cup.

I had been to the Black Bear in Reno earlier this year and had exceptional customer service and a better breakfast. I had ordered a chili cheese omelet and was hoping to order the same thing with this visit. I suppose some menu items are regional or mangers choice. I will probably not be coming back to Black Bear as its far from my house."}
{"text":"we usually try to find some different places while we are on vacation. We where not sure what to expect. i had a feeling we shouldnt come here because all the good reviews where for breakfast but who can screw up a breakfast menu? I ordered the ribs with tri-tip and mac n cheese as a side. the mac n cheese wasnt even close to being good. i give that a 1. I found out later that night that my cousin didnt like it either. On there menu it says the ribs are the most ordered thing. The first rib was a 4.5 but then all the meat disappered because there wasnt much. To of the ribs where broke also, not something you want to see while eating. The tri-tip was ok also the parts you could eat anyways. The garlic bread isnt garlic bread that i give a 1 also. My grandma ordered spaghetti and meat balls and she had to use my steak knife to cut one of her meatballs lol.

never coming back"}
{"text":"We just moved to Gilbert yesterday and decided to give this place a try, (on a recommendation from a co-worker). This place is wonderful!  Great tasting food, very generous portions, and rockstar service. The first cool thing I noticed was the menu. I won't spoil it for anyone, but it's very fun, interesting, and meant for the customers to take home. I've never seen anything like it.

Our waitress was Janna and she is the sweetest thing ever. A couple of our side items were a little cold, so she immediately ran to the kitchen and came back with big portions of the sides that were piping hot. Janna gave superstar service and treated us like family. ???

The food here is made in-house,from scratch. The sweet cream pancakes are fluffy, sweet and delicious. The red potatoes are nicely seasoned and the homemade biscuit was huge, (it filled the bowl it was served in), flaky and so delicious that I ate it with nothing but butter on it. I had Bruce's Meat Lover's Omelette and added mushrooms. It was great and so big that I could only eat half of it. 

Our entire dining experience was amazing! We will definitely make this our regular hot spot. I highly recommend this place. I can't wait to come back and try the lunch and dinner menus."}
{"text":"It's a diner and beyond the aesthetic of the place, which is cool, the food is exactly what you expect it to be. Also you may want to share your plate, everything comes in HUGE portions."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. The severer was slow and the waitress was snarky. Food was just ok. Average maybe, and over priced."}
{"text":"their food looks and smells great whenever we go here. last few times i always get their cali benedict instead of english muffin i sub it with their famous biscuit...YUMMMMMY!!! their portions are huge as usual, never room for dessert...oh well, as long as we are satistied :)"}
{"text":"My  family and I and our friends just had dinner here. I must say, very very disappointing! I don't even know where to start. First off our server was to be desired, she wasn't very attentive and was a little on the rude/short side. First issue with our food is that as I was eating my corn muffin I went to pick up a piece and noticed a dark hair literally baked into the muffin itself. Second issue is that they brought out the entire tables food except for my oldest son's dinner. When my son said something the server claimed it was 'still on the grill'. It took 15 minutes before they brought his food out. That too me is a sign that they forgot his order altogether. Third issue was that the food was very subpar. My wife's green beans looked gross and tasted like they looked. My country fried steak seasoning was so salty that I couldn't even eat it. And the mini corn dogs for my other sons were over cooked and hard to eat. I asked to speak to the manager at the register and she acted annoyed that I was bothering her with our issues and at one point appeared to roll her eyes. For being a new location we had higher hopes but was let down. We will not be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Reuben it was not too good. Bread was hard and cold.  Another person at our table ordered the same it was better. I had them redo mine. I liked the pineapple pancakes from previous visit. It is a fun place. I just do feel like some days they are not serving to order. If you don't like it they are quick to correct. I just do not like to have to do that."}
{"text":"We tried this place on a Saturday morning. Thankfully I was able to call ahead and put my name down. Which is awesome because not many places do this anymore. This place was packed! The decor is adorable. Portions are huge and food is served quickly considering the full house. Our waiter was fun, attentive and kind. Aside from the massive portions, the food was standard breakfast fare. Well done, tasted great."}
{"text":"We have been to the West Bell location many times. This time we decided to try the Tempe location since we were going to go to Arizona Mills afterwards. We were seated pretty quick and the waitress was very nice. Our food seemed to come out pretty quick so I didnt question it. Well hours later my husband started violently throwing up and having really bad dirahea. Myself my stomach was not feeling good at all and not to be crued but pooped alot and felt like I was going to throw up. Now we both feel drained of all energy, hubby is very pale, and havent had anything else to eat cause we dont feel good. So I woild ask them to recook your food if you eat here or make sure its nice and hot and cooked all the way. FOOD POISONING IS NOT FUN. Wont be back probably at all to this location ever again."}
{"text":"Great food on a budget.  You definitely get your money's worth because the portion sizes are large.  The service was good for a busy time of the day."}
{"text":"Visited again after sooo many years, visited AZ after having been gone for about 8 years and we all decided to eat there again in remembrance of our childhood because we would go almost every weekend. Our experience was amazing, they were so sweet and had amazing service and food. The orange juice is fresh squeezed biscuits are huge its was just an overall great experience. Anytime we come back to AZ we will definitely go here again"}
{"text":"We came tonight at around 5 with a party of 6 (4 adults and 2 kids). There was maybe 5 cars in the parking lot and it was seemingly dead inside. We were told we could be seated immediately at 2 separate booths or could wait 20-30 minutes for a table or booth that could seat us all. Apparently someone had reserved a large table, there was already a large party, they refused to open up a \"meeting\" room, and they had seated others at every other table to they couldn't push any together. This is totally unbelievable to me....the place was practically dead. We had a hungry 2 year old with us and my grandma in her 70s that recently had spinal surgery. Needless to say, we couldn't wait in hopes someone else left soon. The worst part? The rude, uncaring, and unapologetic hostess. 

The waitress was not particularly nice, nor was she particularly rude. We were there for 1 hour and 45 minutes total, all due to slow service. We were ready every time for drinks and food orders, so it wasn't due to us. 


The food was good, but it definitely didn't make up for the rest. Trying to juggle the hungry, bored kids between two booths and making sure my grandma was comfortable for nearly two hours did not make for an enjoyable evening. When we paid, the same rude hostess checked us out. I have never felt more unwelcome and uncomfortable in a place like this before. Apathetic doesn't begin to describe this girl.

This place has potential to be warm and welcoming with a country, all American atmosphere (which is obviously what they are going for) but they fall short with the crappy service. I'm definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"First off ... We have been going to BBDs for many years.  Last evening was one of the all time best experiences we have ever had at the many BBDs we have been too in NV as well as CA.  What made this particular experience fantastic was the extraordinary service we received from Mindy, our server.  She was efficient, quick and extremely friendly.  We found out through our conversations with her that a few of us had common interests,  such as, hunting, horses, rodeo, etc., which made the dining experience even better.  We come to LV one or two times a year and we will surely visit this location again.

Thank you again, Mindy!!

Oh, and the food was great as usual."}
{"text":"I finally checked this place out!

It was a few months ago, so I can't remember what I had but it was delicious!  It is right across from IHOP,  and we would always see it so we finally decided to try it out after reading all those great reviews. 

Expect to wait. They are usually ALWAYS busy. We had more than one server, so that was a bit confusing.

I recommend it

EDITED: returned here months later on a week day and it was not consistent unfortunately.  I kept saying I want my eggs well done and it took them 3 times to supposedly get it right,  which they still did not! Potatoes were burned and rock hard-- not soft. Not good at all. Wasted $25!"}
{"text":"Excellent Chicken fried steak, white gravy with mashed potatoes and grilled veggies and salad! The tuna fish was delicious and huge, and tasty clam chowder! The big bear claw is my favorite as is the TO GO vanilla shake! Very efficient, friendly staff! Excellent service! Thanks, Toni!"}
{"text":"Big portions, good food, acceptable prices, and somewhat friendly service. I only came for the breakfast (at lunchtime) and didn't feel bad ordering the hungry bear or whatever it was called. My brother ordered the chicken fried steak and found he preferred country fried steak more. Everything is good though, from the sausages to the eggs to the hash browns, to the ham. At around $8-$9 a person, we left with tax and tip for two people at $25.

The waitress was kind of short with us and in a hurry, and we didn't even come on a weekend or during breakfast. We were totally the only Asian people in the vicinity."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible! I eat out 2-3 times a day and Black Bear diner is the best breakfast joint I've been to out in Henderson!!"}
{"text":"Great food, large portions. The server Dawn was very friendly and kept our glasses full. It was very busy on fathers day but we only waited 15 minutes"}
{"text":"We have been a few times now for breakfast...both during the week and in Sunday.
The weekends are busy, prepare to wait most times, and service seemed a tad slower than weekdays. But, nothing so bad it was too noteworthy.

 The portions are nice size. The food was real good on our visits, that we we have came back."}
{"text":"Looking at the other reviews I think we must have gone here on an off day or at the wrong time. I was disappointed in the food given that I liked the cute decor and the creative menus (which are designed like newspapers). The fries were good, but I definitely didn't think the portions were as huge as others are describing. I had the stuffed chicken pieces and the server did not give me a choice of sides as it says on the menu. And the hollandaise sauce was yucky - but I think I've been spoiled by TC Eggington's."}
{"text":"To sum up - awesome diner located off the strip and it doesn't cost an arm and a leg to eat here.

To elaborate - great place to eat. It's at Tropicana and Jones in the Smith's shopping center. It's pretty low key so you might miss it, but look for the carved bears standing outside the door. Speaking of bears:. this place is ALL ABOUT BEARS. They have stuffed bears on the walls, carved bears, bear murals on the walls...they love them some bears. It's pretty cute, actually. I love the poker bears on the back wall - they're awesome.

Service is pretty good - I've had good and bad service here, so it really just depends on the server. Food comes quickly though, so that's a big plus. They're not open 24 hours, unfortunately. I think their hours run from 6AM to 9:45PM though so you have a pretty good time window to get in here and get stuffed.

As for the food - HELL TO THE YEAH. It's classic American diner fare - chicken fried steak, meatloaf, sandwiches...you name it. My first time here I had the large chicken fried steak. It covered the platter. They don't have dinner plates - they have platters. HUGE. They load them up with food, too. Come hungry. I don't like meatloaf at all - I can eat theirs. It's that good. If you order coffee they'll actually bring you flavored creamer to go with it. For the record, their blackberry cobbler is fantastic.

All in all, this is a great place to eat. The prices are low, the service is pretty good, and the food is fantastic. Eat here."}
{"text":"OK, so this place has a cult-esq following. I just don't get it. I mean it's good. It's typical diner fare. It's not terrible, but certainly not worthy of the exalted status this chain has. So here is the good and the fun. They have a loyalty program where you receive a passport that you get stamped at every location that you go to. You also get a free breakfast on your birthday. So there you go. There is better and there is worse. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"The only thing from keeping this from being 4 ,or dare I say 5 star, is the service. My sense of this place is they know that they have a great product, and that they do, so they let the service suffer. The mistake they have made is they may not be aware that they are in Las Vegas, not California. I was asked by the server if I knew what I wanted, before she had given me a menu. I saw a server complain that a customer was upset because they had tp wait over 45 minuses for their food. OK now that the unpleasantness is out of the way. The corned beef hash was fantastic. So if you don't care about being treated like a valued customer then by all means stop in. If not; there are plenty other diners in the sea. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"This place comes short of the typical black bear diner that I know. First of all they seem to always be understaffed. They are supper slow when it comes to taking an order and bringing it out. The place is smaller that the normal restaurant. They blast the AC making your food cold by the time it reaches ur table. Their gravy sucks. Not as creamy or flavorful. Overall the service is pittyful. Cooks need to learn to execute their recipes better."}
{"text":"My favorite place for ribs that was my spot while I was pregnant I'd get their ribs all the time. I do like their sandwhich as well. btw! They have the best molten lava cake I've ever tried and their vanilla ice cream is so good."}
{"text":"1st time ever visiting this restraunt and I don't plan to come back anytime soon. We were seated promptly but never even had a chance to eat our food. We witnessed 2 couples get seated after us and get their orders taken before ours by the the same waiter that came to wait on us. Both couples received their meals while we sat and waited for another 15 minutes before leaving. Wish I could give you 0 stars!"}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars I would. I was told when I called no waiting. What a joke put my name down on their list when I called. I arrived they then took 2 large parties before us. Aaron the manager didn't even try to make it right. Just the usual dumb answer \"sorry\". No your not sorry. Worse service ever. Don't tell me on the phone no waiting take how many in my party then tell a couple minutes and we end up waiting 20 minutes in the lobby before we left."}
{"text":"We read the reviews and this place seemed to have all their ducks in a row as other yelpers have posted their service and food were great.   While others have said the opposite,  which peaked my curiosity to try this place myself.

So we decided to arrive early around 530 pm to avoid the rush.   When we got there the restaurant had plenty of seats and no wait which made us very happy. 5 stars

The cup of chicken noodle I ordered was awful and tasted like it came from a can.  1 star

The chicken and waffle was misleading since it was chicken tender and waffle,  but that didn't matter because the waffle was delicious. Although the tender was dry and hard versus juicy and crispy like it should be. 3 stars

Chicken Biscuit and gravy presentation was a fail,  but it tasted good so that was a win.   We decided a more suitable name would be upside down chicken pot pie. 3 stars

The kids portion were enormous, that's about it.  Nothing great. 3 stars

It's a restaurant chain with ok food but it wasn't anything amazing about it when you compare it to the other big names like Dennys or IHOP. I can see us visiting this place maybe once a year...maybe.

My wife looked down when we were seated and noticed the floors were filthy.  Good thing these are zero demerits and since their last inspection in April they still struggle in this area."}
{"text":"Well.... they say on the menu the Chicken fried steak is the #1 seller and I agree it's good.  We went there today hoping the rest of the menu is on par with the CFS.  Well.... we can see why everyone gets the CFS.  The bacon was like beef jerky.  Too chewy.  Not crispy.  The biscuit minus gravy was a bit dry.  Even butter wasn't enough to moisten it.  Gravy is the only solution.  The homemade corned beef has was meh.  It was just shredded corned beef brisket with some potatoes.  They need to grill the hash so it's has more crisp.  The hash browns are also a bit soggy.  A small amount of crisp, but not enough to want to finish the hash browns.  The sweet cream pancakes were very sweet.  Tasted like angel food cake batter was used to make the pancakes.   I didn't realize this place was a chain.  I thought it was a local mom and pop shop.  Now I realize the CFS was something special that got me to come back, but the bacon being like jerky is something that would make me not come back.   A disappointing 2 stars for the sequel to this story."}
{"text":"The food is excellent here and my girlfriend and I had the best service from a waiter. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. We'll be back and keep up the great service"}
{"text":"We wanted a new tradition of not cooking on Thanksgiving and no family stress and a laid back meal and we found it at Black Bear.  I had fried chicken and my husband had turkey!  Yummy!!  Welcome to Tempe!!"}
{"text":"We were recently in Vegas and found Black Bear Diner on Yelp. We first went for breakfast. They have great waffles, pancakes, eggs (served many different ways) and biscuits at least two inches tall!  I was impressed by the employees and their happy attitudes. Most impressive was the manager that was at the window making sure the food was getting out in a timely manner, then he was at the hostess stand making sure guests were being seated as promptly as possible, and then he worked the dining area to make sure guests were enjoying their meals. Needless to say, we went back for brunch the next day before catching our flight. Black Bear Diner will always be on our places to eat from now on."}
{"text":"First time going here tonight with the family. We decided to go since none of the \"usual\" choices was working out. Thankfully it was really close to where we live. 

The service, at least to me, is quite good. There was some waiting to do but not horrible. For drinks: mom, lil' bro, and I ordered the OJ. Mom's bf ordered coke lol. I'm an OJ-type of girl. I even ask my grandma to buy bag-fulls of oranges just to freshly squeeze them for me in the morning. I have to say, their OJ was yummy--didn't have too much pulp but you can tell they're not store-bought. 

I ordered the Bear Paw Chicken-Fried Steak alongside red-skinned mashed potatoes, corn bread muffin and lots of heavenly gravy. I also ordered a side of their famous Sweet Cream pancakes (short stack).  Mom ordered the T-Bone steak with baked potato and their muffin as well. Bro ordered their Gardenstyle Veggie burger with Jack cheese and fries on the side. Mom's bf ordered the BIGFOOT Chicken-Fried Steak and eggs. He got it with hash browns, but instead of the biscuits he opted for the pancakes. 

My chicken noodle soup and mom's salad came first. Soup was okay; not salty and the serving size was just right (since the main dishes were HUGE). We waited a little bit for our orders but I wasn't complaining at all, since I'd usually be getting antsy after 10-15 minutes of waiting. I got my pancakes first, slobbered butter all over and pretty much drenched them in syrup (yum!) Short stack comes with two pancakes the size of regular dinner plates at my house, my mom was surprised at how their \"short stack\" was too big of an order. The top pancake was a little burnt, so that's a bit of a downside, but the bottom one was the most perfect pancake I've ever eaten in Las Vegas. I've been searching for a good breakfast place and I think I've found it in Black Bear! As I was still waiting for my main order, I took a bite off of my brother's veggie burger. The texture of the patty told my taste buds it ain't real meat, but the taste definitely passed the test. Their fries were also pretty good, I actually ate a lot of it (sorry bro!) My mom also gave me a piece of her steak; now, I'm not much of a steak person when I'm not craving it, but that piece of meat was juicy and flavorful. My chicken-fried steak finally came, and the first bite was enough for me to rave about this place. I've had \"country-fried\" or \"chicken-fried\" steak from other places, namely casinos, and they all were too salty or too dry/hard or just plain yucky! I didn't even used a knife to cut it, and when I put it in my mouth it just melted. It was crunchy and creamy and all sorts of heavenly goodness in one bite! The side of mashed potatoes were also quite awesome, I like how they used red potatoes--best kind for mashed. The veggies tasted good too; a little greasy at times but hey, that's what diner food is all about. 

We couldn't go for dessert, everyone was just too full and in food heaven by the time we were done. Gave our server $10 tip since she was attentive the whole time. Definitely going back next time I'm craving breakfast food :D"}
{"text":"Stopped off here for breakfast before heading to our golf tournament.
At 6:30 am, the place wasn't too busy. But a little slow to get seated.
Once seated, our server, Jeannie, greeted us with a smile and joyfully wished us a good morning, for being so early in the morning. She definitely put a smile on our faces. 
We all ordered a variation of the Classic 2 Egg Breakfast. I ordered three link sausage, eggs sunny side up, hash browns and sour dough toast.
Everything's was cooked perfectly. The hash browns were wider than I'm used to. This was a hearty breakfast. Had to leave half of one toast and half of the hash browns.
Great place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Opens early in the morning, 6 AM. We stopped off here for breakfast before golfing at Coldwater Golf Club. At 6:30 AM, there were plenty of tables and the breakfast was large and filling.
We just had the basic breakfast, eggs, sausage, toast and something different than hash browns, shredded hash browns. I think it's better than home potatoes."}
{"text":"We just happened to stop here for breakfast after seeing a billboard advertisement and we were not disappointed. The food was great, huge portions, and the service was excellent. Our server, Salvador, was awesome!"}
{"text":"As a breakfast snob I am EXTREMELY picky with breakfast. That being said, Black Bear doesn't make the cut for me. When I choose to go out and spend money on breakfast rather than stay home and cook, it needs to be nothing short of AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS.  

I typically frequent Cracker Barrel, Good Egg, or US Egg for breakfast (my fave being the Barrel) and they don't ever disappoint. But I thought it may be time to try a new place!

I'm a traditional gal and I am pretty satisfied with pancakes, bacon,  and eggs. The way I see it,  if you can do the basics right then the rest of your creations shouldn't disappoint. 

1)  Sweet cream pancakes: they're good. That's it. Just gpod. I wouldn't run up the street raving about them. I find Cracker Barrels extremely better. Again, I'm a snob.

2) Bacon is my favorite part of breakfast and if you don't make it crispy then I'm not happy. So the bacon is good if you like the chewy kind. I dont. It's got to be crisp! (I think I even want to hear the crispy crackly sound when I take a bite) Yup, still a snob.

Lastly, 

3) I am not crazy about country potatoes but when they come with the meal I expect them to be CRISPY. They're potatoes weren't.  And weren't special at that.

So if you're looking for a place to eat some breakfast,  with large portion sizes, at a well price. Then you may enjoy it! (But for my other snobbers out there keep on lookin...)"}
{"text":"Good food and portion sizes.  The bear claws are yummy!"}
{"text":"Upon arrival, you are given a newspaper with Glendale news from a many years ago. Mine was a 1967 front page newspaper, inside which guests will find the menu. I really enjoyed this feel, made you feel almost like you are at your own kitchen table. Older interior but kept clean, very nice homey feel-very welcoming atmosphere. Servers are all smiles and very kind, mostly women, at least in the morning when I visited. Play oldies music in background, easy listening. 

Average plate price looked to be in the 7.50 to 10.00 range. Has full breakfast, lunch and dinner menu. Meal came out within 5 minutes. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros Benedict for 10.49 (yes more expensive than most but sounded so good). Potatoes not as crisp as I normally like but tasted fresh which is most important. The fruit was fresh, crisp, and cool. The eggs Benedict were good, just slightly, again, not as crispy as I would prefer on the English muffin. The meal I selected had green chillies, pulled pork, and of course a poached egg. I never had this before and would probably order a bacon or sausage Benedict instead next time, simply because that is what I am used to for breakfast taste. Overall, however, a tasty meal with a drink that stayed filled.

I would certainly come here again; the lunch menu looks very appealing to me with fresh sandwiches and salads. The menu has a \"little less\" section for seniors or people that don't swallow as much food as the average joe. Those prices are in the 6.00-7.50 range. They also have a conference room for guests with large parties. I saw some family or company meeting at 8:30am on a Thursday! I was surprised, but they seemed to be enjoying themselves.

Again, overall a very good experience. I am very glad it was clean and welcoming."}

{"text":"Having had eaten in Redding CA at the original... I was excited that there was a BBD near me. 
I got breakfast the other day to \"take to my cave\" but ended up throwing it all out. 
Hash browns..... eh.... just frozen potatoes and not even tasty. 
Biscuit... two of them.... like lead.... I should have left when I walked in.... a table not yet cleared of dirty dishes had almost my exact order left uneaten by previous customer. 
Gravy.... package and water.... can't you add milk? For creaminess? Or something?
Eggs.... scrambled.... and they're so yellow.... becaaaauuuuse? Is it a frozen egg product with added color?
If I want to eat packaged food with minimum attention to flavor or quality... this is my place. 
I expect Robotics will be the next innovation at BBD because human thought is not taking place in the kitchen. Absolutely inedible..... and if you screw up eggs? Am I supposed to have faith in anything else?
Oh the staff was very friendly. Had I eaten in..... I would loved to have discussed my meal... not wanting anything free.... just want to find a GOOD place to eat."}
{"text":"I've driven by this spot many times and thought about coming in for breakfast. I ended up eating lunch here a couple of months ago before a movie and it was a bad experience all around. 

The inside of the restaurant has a grubby feel. Our waitress didn't take too long to come by and take our orders, but it went downhill after that. We ordered two sandwiches and waited for a long time. We even asked a couple of times how much longer it would. The waitress said the food was almost ready. My friend noticed that our orders were sitting on the warmer. We finally tracked down our waitress and she brought over the plates that we had spotted sitting on the warmers. The wait was too long for two sandwiches.

Our food was not good at all. My friend put it well when he asked how someone could mess up a Reuben? They had indeed messed up a Reuben. It was rubbery and not good. My BLT would have been good if it had been brought out in a timely manner. The bacon was crispy, but the hot mayonnaise concerned me so I didn't eat much of the sandwich. Our salads to start were fine, but took about 30 minutes to arrive. 

Maybe we just had a server that was having an off day, but the slow service led to bad food. I usually will give restaurants a second try, but I'm not sure I will this time."}
{"text":"Being from a restaurant - owning family, I would say that I am one of the harder critics to please when dining out. This place has won my respect and business for now on. Not only was the wait staff very prompt and friendly during an extremely busy breakfast rush, the food was quick to the table as well, exceeding my expectations of the kitchen. The atmosphere was awesome, making this chain diner feel like your hometown family owned place. The food was delicious as well, with big portions, especially for the price. I ordered the corned beef hash and was expecting run of the mill out of a can stuff. I couldn't be more wrong. The plate came out and was very obviously home made with no lack of meat. If you like diners and want to feel at home, try this place out!"}
{"text":"Right when I walked in the energy in that diner was OUTSTANDING. I was greeted by everybody! Including the cooks. Look I'm 23 and I could care less about writing reviews BUT I couldn't let this go, I had to write a review. I felt happy after I left.
Also, Denise who is the one who personally helped me and she was amazing, greeted me with a smile and remembered my name. Pretty impressed. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Our waitress was Tonya and she was exceptional! Good service is hard to come by these days."}

{"text":"I came here for my free birthday breakfast so what's to complain about? It was actually my first time at a Black Bear Diner and I loved the experience. The surrounding are fun and the staff was super friendly. I'm  sitting at the counter as I write this as I await my free breakfast but the food in the window in front of me looks amazing. Super large portions. People smiling I think I'm going to like this place. Food is coming out I am not disappointed at all the sweet cream waffle is amazing. And such a huge portion for a freebie. The only thing keeping it from a 5-star review was the wait.  The place was relatively empty but  I waited probably about twice as long as I would at a Denny's . The bottom line is I'll be back and next time I will bring my wallet."}
{"text":"First time here and found by accident, just saw a sign and went. Man, what a find...the food we had was great, so I can probably say it would all be the same.  Prices are good and the portions are incredible. If you want a great breakfast, here is the place. Haven't tried lunch or dinner but considering breakfast it will all be just as good."}
{"text":"I love sharing a rack of ribs whenever I go over there, the ribs are fall off of the bone ribs and so good, not overcooked like some restaurants. The side dishes are also in good sized portions so I only need one side rather than two and even then I'm taking food home."}
{"text":"Horrible... We went there a few months ago and the server was OK. The kitchen staff on the other hand was disgusting. I am sure no one wants to hear this but we ordered and our coffee cups were dirty, our utensils were dirty, and the food was late with hair in it. On top of that we did not order a side of green beans and they came soaked in a bowl of butter. I am sure any vegan would of got sick from that. 15 caliores for beans and they were soaked in 400 and freezing cold. Don't eat here. They gave my boyfriend his meal for free for the hair and made us pay for the rest, just a icky experience."}
{"text":"We went to Black Bear Diner for the first time last night. My husband ordered the pot roast and it came with the usual vegetables plus  salad and 2 more sides. He got the green beans and onion rings. It was awesome! I ordered the chicken fried steak, salad, green beans and baked potato. Everything was good except my chicken fried steak was mostly gristle-gross! And it tasted like a frozen patty - not freshly made. And for dessert we ordered the blackberry cobbler. The crust was very hard and it had an odd taste. Overall - most was all right but if we do comeback- it will be for the breakfast."}
{"text":"We were newbies here and Marlene gave us a few recommendations.  Our dinner was amazing and so was the service! We will definitely be back.  Hopefully on a day when Marlene is working because she was terrific!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriends favorite breakfast spot. Good price for filling size plates. The eggs Benedict are super good. My boyfriend usually switches it up. But everything he's ordered has been pretty awesome. They are consistent with the quality of food and every server we have had has been generous and nice. We enjoy coming here and I would definitely recommend it."}

Give it a try....breakfast was the bomb ...u"}
{"text":"Bit of a dive ... odd odor when you walk in ... and the decor feels like something from mid-70's kitsch.  But the food was good, especially after a late night on the strip.  If you're looking for a hang over brunch, Black Bear is worth a trip off of the strip.

We had the chicken fried steak (normal sized), which was covered in a reasonable white gravy.  Not the best I have ever had, but wasn't too bad either. Not overly greasy, and still had good crunch on the crust.

Also had the burger with nacho cheese and tortilla strips.  I know, disgusting.  But we were hung over and it actually tasted pretty good.  Burger was hand pressed and not overly dry, and the cheese and tortillas provided a great creamy/crunchy texture contrast."}
{"text":"This is the first and last time at this location.  Food took wayyyyy too long and when the food came out it was cold. I stuck my finger in the gravy and kept it there cause that shit was COLD as hell! Won't be back that's for sure!"}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the portion size...they're huge. They have a wide menu variety. I have to admit I like the taste of their breakfast menu items better than their lunch and dinner menu items."}

{"text":"We have been here several times. This is the first time after the remodel. The food was cold and taste like it was warmed up in a microwave with freezer burn. As always great customer service. But the one thing my kids always enjoyed was getting a balloon and it looks like they took that away also. We won't be back."}
{"text":"My mother and I visited, yesterday.  We had a difficult time deciding what we wanted because there were so many options.  We ended up splitting salmon with spinach, a side of mixed vegetables and green beans with soup and a roll.  We also split bread pudding.  The waitress and cashier were very pleasant.  Our drinks were always full, the waitress had suggestions on dessert, and checked on us often.  The restaurant was quiet, clean, and decorated in a rustic style.  Would love to go back for breakfast."}
{"text":"Normally I'd give this joint 5 stars bcuz almost EVERYTHING IS *AWSM*
However- just went w/my moms & ewww what a disappointment :(
She had the fried chicken & me a basic burger - burger was ehh ok at best but the chicken was bad news bears!!! The corn bread muffin was delivered warm but turned to a rock shortly after, leading me to believe they nuked it ... The batter on the chicken was nasty & the chicken itself was ALLLL FAT! Even the mixed veggies were gross!
At $14 bucks this dish is NO BUENO!
If you find yourself @ BBD - try the Cali Benedict or the sweet cream waffle & finish w/a personal pie of your liking or the diners specialty - a  big bear bear claw ;) enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food was very delicious and the portions were huge! Love the fresh squeeze OJ which is a bit pricey but worth it!! Service was good."}
{"text":"Ambience: 5/5. Looking for a local, unique place to eat in Vegas? This is the coolest! First of all, there is bear-ly anything in this restaurant that isn't bear themed (so many puns everywhere) making it really fun for kids. It's out on Tropicana ave so you see the mountains as you drive up. You may have to wait a few minutes (11:30 am Sunday we waited 10 minutes) but it is worth it. 
Food: 5/5. We tried the regular and the pineapple upside down pancakes(highly recommend), both were amazing and fluffy- the biscuit with gravy is so huge its the size of a dinner plate. Everything tasted top notch. There are really cool and creative menu options and we were sad that we didn't have time to come back for dinner. (we had plate envy of the nearby tables too). They have these mini pies, like the size of a cereal bowl, which are heavenly and can feed a group of 4.
Price: 5/5. SO CHEAP compared to what you get on the strip or around Freemont. Portions are monstrous, our milkshake was more like three. You can eat breakfast for 9-15$ a person, but one combo easily feeds 2."}
{"text":"I have driven by this restaurant just about every day on my way to work and always wanted to stop in and see what they had to offer.  Took a day off with my love for a day of Christmas shopping and decided to stop in for a late, late, breakfast.  Let me just say this place is perfect if you are really hungry their portions are huge!  I had the Classic 2- Egg Combo with Portuguese Linguica Sausage and he had the thick cut bacon.  You can have toast with this meal but, they recommend, and so do I, the biscuit which is the size of a small loaf of bread, not really but it is huge!  The food was delicious and perfectly cooked and the service was amazing!  I will definitely be back and it will definitely become one of the go to places for dinner when working late."}
{"text":"Got the corn bread and eggs Benedict. And great service very friendly"}
{"text":"The wife and I went here on a recent weekend after having it on our radar for quite awhile.  I expected it to be crowded when we got there around 8am on Sunday, but there was hardly anyone there, although as we were wrapping it up, business had picked up a little bit.  

Service was fine, nothing bad, nothing great.  We both started off with coffee, which was average.  The wife ordered a mini-stack of pancakes, which was huge, she had about half of them leftover for the next morning.  I ordered an omelet (avocado/mushroom/cheese minus the mushroom).  First of all, not only was this omelet pretty big, it seemed like they substituted the subtracted mushrooms with additional avocado, which was very nice.  There was a ton of avocado on top, plus in every bite of egg as well.  The hash browns that came along with it were very good as well, nice and crispy.  

I saved the second half of the hashed browns and the biscuit for breakfast the next morning.  Both were as good the next day as they were the first day after putting them in the toaster oven.

Overall, I enjoyed Black Bear very much and hope to go  back soon."}
{"text":"Me and my friends were visiting from LA and decided to go in to Black Bear Diner for breakfast before we headed out. The food was amazing, I ordered the chicken fried steak, because our server recommended it and it was soooo good! It was my first time trying it. Our server's name was Flower, and she was the sweetest little thing! I felt very comfortable and welcomed sitting at her table. She was fast, got our order right although we were all extremely picky, and gave the best service. Very impressed... I'm definitely going to be recommending this place to my friends and I'll be back next time I'm in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Second go-round at Black Bear Diner involved my husband and his cousin along with her boyfriend. The couple beckoned upon us to dine with them since they were in town for a friend's 40th birthday. My husband's desire to eat off the Strip made our decision become Black Bear Diner this morning for a late breakfast around 11 AM.

The restaurant still retains its homey vibe with all the bears looking down upon your from the rafters. The newspaper menus are a nice touch, especially with their extensive menu items.

I was tempted to order a more lunch-like item, but everyone else seemed to be going for breakfast. I didn't feel like too many eggs or pancakes so I decided upon their combo-type plate which allow you to choose from a few different options to make a specific breakfast meal for yourself for $8.99

My order included biscuits and gravy, link sausages, and eggs over easy. Black Bear provides a heaping mound of food - don't worry, you will not leave this place hungry. My biscuits and gravy were all right. The biscuits were delicious and flaky, not too dense, but not too airy either. However, the gravy was lacking. It certainly was lacking bits of sausage, which I would expect more of and it was lacking a salty-taste. Unfortunately they were a miss for me. My eggs were extremely runny. I realize I ordered them over easy, but even the white were a bit under cooked for my preference. The sausage links were tasty. 

The only other thing I can comment on is apparently their homemade sausage patties contain fennel seeds, which understandably, some people do not enjoy, myself included. My husband's cousin ended up picking out quite of few of them from her patties so she could enjoy the meat without so many seeds. So - if you don't like fennel - beware!

I'm going to stick with my 4-star rating, especially since service was good, the coffee was good, and because the bit of pancakes I ate off my husband's plate were very good as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I gave Black Bear Diner a try and we were not disappointed. From the moment we walked in, we were taken care of. The wait was very minimal even though the place was packed with customers! After being called for a table, our waitress took our beverage order and came back immediately. The wait for the our food took 20 minutes ish. The biscuits are very huge and all the food portions are generous. 
Aside from the good service and delicious food, the parking was the only issue. It's a small parking area and can get pretty stuffed. 
We would go back again. :)"}

Now get out and enjoy!!!!"}

{"text":"Absolutely fabulous it pays to eat off the strip at local favorites. Food, price, service and overall experience was superb, breakfast or lunch"}
{"text":"First of all, the food was great.  Good portions, good tasting, and the waitress was good also.  My complaint comes when I was trying to pay for my ticket.  For my brother and I, $30.  I got charged $88.  I thought it would take a couple minutes to fix, which is fine, but 15 minutes starts to put things behind schedule if you have a full day planned.  I didn't want to cause a scene because I didn't want to make any of the elderly couples or the staff uncomfortable.  It would've been cool if he would've taken a few bucks off the bill, but I was just given 5 Bear Bucks.
For one thing, Black Bear Diner is a luxury for me, a place where I go if I have extra cash or I wanna show someone an awesome breakfast restaurant.  So, I go there once-in-a-while and Bear Bucks are pretty much useless and is gonna get lost almost immediately. 
So, after 15 minutes of having several customers giving me that \"what did he do?\" look, inconveniently making me late to my next appointment (15 freeway minutes is a lot), I leave 5 Bear Bucks richer.
But the problem was resolved. I guess next time I should just say something and maybe they'll have a faster way of dealing with this situation. But I think them offering a discount on the meal would've made me glad to wait.  \"Sorry Sir, there was a problem.  I'd like to offer a discount on your meal while I fix the problem.  Thank you.\"  Problem solved and I still leave satisfied. Late, but satisfied."}
{"text":"The place looked pretty awesome inside.  We were seated right away, however, had to wait 15 min for our waitress to come and take our drink order.  There is so much good comfort food it is hard to choose. I had the country fried steak, veggies, and a baked potato.  I should have just gottent the mashed potatoes.  Everything was amazing, although if you don't like onions I am not sure that you will like the veggies, they had a very strong onion taste to them.  I can not wait to come back for breakfast."}

{"text":"We've heard such great things about Black Bear that we decided to check it out today for Sunday Breakfast which we usually do at home. When we pulled up it was so busy and we had a bit of a time finding parking. That's always a great sign. Once inside I was pleasantly surprised at the decor. Made me feel kind of like I was in a cabin in the woods. The wait was about 20 minutes to be seated. I loved how the menus look like newspapers and have some cool info about how the restaurant came about. Our waitress took our order quickly and we waited. My husband is not a patient guy so the fact that the people seated right before us were literally almost done eating before we got our food, but it was about a ten minute wait before we started eating after we sat down. I ordered the chorizo scramble with a side of bacon. I didn't realize it came with either hash browns or country potatoes and toast until the waitress told me. When my order came out I was in shock at the huge portions, and it looked and smelled fabulous! The first bite to the last was so delicious. My husband ordered The Grizz. It came with pancakes, two eggs, ham, sausage and he got country potatoes. He said the pancakes were a bit sweet for him, but he said it was really good and we both left so full."}
{"text":"The wait might be long, but the food is great! Nomnomnom!
This place is a locals classic. They build their restaurants to be reminiscent of  \"when life was a little more simple, and service and quality were the cornerstones of business.\" Its a great motto and they execute it very well. I have been driving past this place since I was 15 years old and it was ALWAYS busy. I felt, it was time to finally take the plunge and get in on the buzz. Boy am I sure glad we did!

The server was very polite even though she was extremely busy. She brought us coffee right away and took our order as soon as we decided. The one thing that I LOVE in my coffee is Splenda, which they(like so many other restaurants) didn't have. Not a huge deal, but i just hate sweet-and-low, and equal.. Yuckkk! Coffee was good though. Woke us right up! My son accidentally spilled his chocolate milk all over the table and our server was over at our table, super fast, with plenty of napkins to help. 

I ordered the \"Volcano\" which came with \"Sweet Cream Pancakes\"(Which were excellent), Sausage links(fantastic! Tasted like homemade sausage), and crispy, delicious Bacon. Good portion size, but with the food being soo good, no portion size is going to help. This is a perfect place to have breakfast and fall back into the \"simple life\". We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Service is good, food is good. I initially tried the Black Bear Diner in St. George UT. That location seems to have things running much smoother. While at the Diner on Friday we overheard some employees mention how understaffed they were. That was true, but they did try to be as helpful as possible. I'll definitely give 5 stars when we go next time and they don't seem to be as understaffed."}
{"text":"Sure is better than Dennys and Ihop and the service was great.  I don't think I'm ever going to Dennys or IHop ever again."}
{"text":"The simple bacon and eggs with hash browns with sourdough toast was wonderful!  Perfect portions on mine, other plates were full and looked Yummy! Great Sunday morning treat ."}
{"text":"We've been coming to these place but our last visit made me say, \"I don't want to go back here anymore\".   I used to love their pancake for its buttermilk flavor, but now I can't hardly taste it!  The last time we were there I ordered corned beef and the beef was so though, I can't hardly chew it.  The orange juice was horrible coz it was water down.  My husband didn't want me to complain but I told him, that's the last time we're going to have breakfast here."}
{"text":"Never had a problem with this place the food is great! I had just told my husband this should be our spot for future dates! Anyways I  was not happy with the Lava cake I order! I understand it suppose to be hot but not that hot!  I burned my tongue!! From my understanding they have use a microwave to warm things up!  Even putting the ice cream on the cake it just made it hard and not good to eat tasted burnt! My husband had gone to pay for our desserts he had explained to the staff about it but seemed they didn't care and gave us a 5.00 bear bucks!  I was sad I wanted to enjoy a dessert with my husband but I guess I will not order this anymore!  I understand that it was close to closing time and a lot of staff was in a rush to get things out and done!  It was only 9pm but still we should've gotten that cake taken off our bill.. When you order the Lava cake make sure you check the middle of it before eating it!"}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner is exactly what you would expect from a diner. They have all the typical diner food, and the ambience is the stereotypical diner setting. If you like Blueberry Hill, this is the place for you. Good food, the price is right, and they have everything. If you're looking for simple, of if you simply don't know what you want to eat, go here, they have everything."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite and to take my mother in law out to Black Bear. She loved it!! The service was great and the food was awesome. Ryan the manager came by and visited with us. Of course we had to stop by the gift shop for a few things. And picked up dessert. Bavarian cream cherry pie and a bear claw.  Yumm....if you have never been to a Black Bear you should definitely stop by and check this one out. They did it proud"}
{"text":"Stopped in visiting from CA...good comfort food and adequate serving sizes.  They just brought prime rib back to menu but is only served medium so opted for Little Less chicken fried steak."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and huge I love this place have no complaints the customer service was awesome I would recommend this place to a friend"}
{"text":"Went here Saturday around 10am. Ample seating and great location. The staff was prompt and courteous and our meal was delivered very quickly. Portions were unbearlievable haha. Really though it was quite a lot of food and very enjoyable. Will definitely be returning as this is now our go to breakfast joint."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Our server checked on us multiple times so we never had to wave her down. The food came out quick and hot. The price range is the same as ihop but the door and service is much better! (: I love this place !"}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner
1809 E. Baseline Road
Gilbert, AZ
480-926-2046

In my continuing quest for good food at reasonable prices, I was convinced by two companions to try Black Bear Diner. They are a chain of about 50 restaurants in the western states.

We arrived at dinner hour and were promptly greeted and seated. The atmosphere is a bit eclectic and kind of reminds one of a hunting lodge in the mountains. Our waitress came promptly to the table and asked about drinks. 

The menu is written on a kind of newsprint, and makes interesting reading. Apparently, each one is tailored to the state it is printed in, and is replete with interesting facts about the state.

Companion 1 ordered the Cobb Salad ($8.99). The portion size was enormous, and two could have easily made a meal of it. Nice smoky bacon, a large portion of blue cheese, and tons of assorted salad on a plate that was more than 12 inches across. Companion 1 was unable to finish half of it and ended up with a doggie box to take for the next day's lunch.

Companion 2 ordered the Bacon Burger ($10.49). I'm not sure, but I'd bet that the patty was a half pound of meat. By the time it was all stacked up with all the fixings, I couldn't figure out how anyone could get their mouth around it - but companion 2 managed it along with the cheese on it and a portion of onion rings instead of fries.

For myself, I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak. It came on another huge plate (a necessity for the size of the portion) along with mashed potatoes smothered in gravy and fresh cooked assorted veggies. There was little doubt that the veggies were cooked to order as they were still a little crisp and done to perfection. All this came with a delicious corn muffin to add to the calorie count.

None of us could avoid desert. Other than Washington State and Oregon, I've never been served anything with huckleberries - perhaps it's because the bears like to eat them as much as the humans do, so they are expensive and hard to come by. Nonetheless, they had huckleberry ice cream - the only correct word for it was yum! Companion 1 had it over a deep dish cherry pie, and companion 2 had it as a shake. Neither of my companions could finish their deserts. I had mine as a simple ball of ice cream in a dish, and just managed to finish it.

Service was outstanding, and everything was nice and clean. 

I give them 4 stars for quality, portion size, and cleanliness."}
{"text":"I really like it here. I do not like the wait though. It is worth it to wait. If you ask for water while waiting they will give you a nice icy glass of water which helps because it is warm out.  You get nice filling portions. They do charge for Orange Juice refills. I ordered the Shrimp Po Boy. This is new on the menu. Bread is so soft but way to soft for this sandwich. Bread will get a bit soggy because of the sauce they put on it. Shrimp is not exactly Louisiana style. It has ok taste to it but not spicy enough the breading on the shrimp was a bit too undercooked. Everything falls out when you try to bite into it. I do not recommend this sandwich to anyone that has had a good one before from somewhere else. If you don't care how a Po Boy is made and you like a big sandwich to get full off then I guess go ahead and get it. I will just stick to the other things on the menu like the Pot Roast sandwich or chicken fried steak plate. I have eaten here before and was very satisfied with what I got. I just wanted to try something out of the ordinary and new from here. I give Black Bear 5 stars because of everyone else  plates and my previous experiences eating here. Oh and I love the red skin mash potatoes here the are the bomb thought I would throw that in. If you sign up to be on the mailing list you will receive a free meal on your birthday."}
{"text":"Generous portions for the price paid for. Feels like a classic place to eat. Service was quick. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"I have came to this diner a few times. This is my daughters favorite place to come as she calls it the bear place. When I came with my mom a few times while back I said I wouldn't come back but I gave it another try and I'm glad I did! The food is super yummy I get the chicken and waffles share it with my daughter. Well tonight my daughter had pancakes and sausage she cleared her plate! As I did my chicken and waffles. I'm glad to have a place like this to come to with her where the service from the moment we walk in by the cashier to the waitress Tahra who said yay my favorite because she remembers us. I have for nothing that I don't like here. As long as the service keeps up and food is yummy we will stay regulars ."}
{"text":"This was a fun place to eat good food. There was a wait, but no more th and 20 minutes. Food was great, service was great, and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Our eggs were lukewarm, the biscuits dry, and it just didn't blow us away.  It's a chain, from the menu description of other locations, and I wont be visiting the location near my home.  You do get big portions, but the food just isn't great.  It doesn't taste fresh, and it wasn't cooked with particular care.  The stuffed animals inside seem like huge dust collectors.  The booth had no padding, so unless you balanced very carefully, your behind was on wood struts under the seat and nothing else.  I feel bad saying this, but it didn't seem much different than Denny's, just bigger portions.  The service was nice, if not present often, and it has a homey ambiance.  It just wasn't great."}
{"text":"I am enjoying a great cup of coffee and a well done breakfast of eggs and sausage. The spicy sausage is  spicy but not too spicy. No big surprises here, which is perfect for breakfast at a diner."}
{"text":"When my hunger hits at a lumberjack level I like coming here and taking it out on one of the burgers. I know you can get a burger at a fast food place but it isn't quite the same. Black Bear diner offers you well put together burger with quality ingredients that isn't going to fall apart on me when I try eating it. I love how everything is just right ..meaning some places put so much mayo or sauce the meat starts slipping out when you bite into it. I hate when that happens. That's why I can't go to Checkers anymore.... it's a turn off. I also like that they have home made chips as one of their choices instead of just fries. 

If you love pies this is the place to be ! Their mini pies with a side of al la mode. It's a comfort food in it's purest form. The warm filling and the cool ice cream....now I'm hungry ?! It's a place where you can get some down home cooking especially if you don't want to do it yourself!"}
{"text":"Had lunch on 3/14 after picking my sister up from airport. She and my mother's first time eating here and although the food in the restaurant was very good we ordered a tuna melt for my father to go but when we got home it was a patty melt and it was over cooked dry not edible. Big disappointment since my dad is 88 and was really looking forward to the tuna melt."}
{"text":"I love the food and the atmosphere..it's always great service and people are always friendly. The prices are very reasonable and great portion sizes. With that said I will say the waiter/manager Mike is the worst waiter/manager. I've had him 3 times and every time my orders wrong. He pays no attention to his customers and walks around like he's the best one there. I actually ask the hostess not to sit me in his section anymore..the other thing is the way he talks to his fellow employees. He's rude and disrespectful disrespectful to them in eat shot of customers. He is the worst thing about the black bear diner...so if you avoid mike, you will love it."}
{"text":"uggghh, after a wild night of partying, and a morniing of 'where am i\" and \"who are these people?\"
we took a cab to this place,
first off.. this is a bit off the strip, but when i walked in i swear i thought i was in frontier land at disneyland and customer service is great.
sure this place is small, but their menu is a newspaper !!!

this is a great place for breakfast!!! you'll love it! and its reasonably priced!!!
Raymond (the little old guy manager) treats you like your his best friend

the onlyh thing i reccomend is that you don't cab it... take the bus..
its right on tropicana (west)"}
{"text":"Decided to have dinner here since I have not been here for about 2 years now and felt I was missing something. Inside this place would remind you of a log style cabin with homey fixtures and memorabilia that is black bear related. Me and my cousin came in and I had the chicken fried steak and he had the meatloaf. Not the best chicken fried steak I've had but it was good and the some of the side veggies were burned (zucchini, squash, & broccoli). Having a small bite of the meatloaf it was tasty, tender and well seasoned. Service was quick at first but after the food was dropped the waitress was no where to be found for refills."}
{"text":"Try the reuben and don't miss the parmesan kettle chips! A good family style atmosphere, generous portions, average prices."}
{"text":"9/04
I like!  Not all diners can take me back to my first months living in CA.  Stepping into this Black Bear Diner, I felt like I had stepped into my uncle's Buckhorn motel and restaurant (sold a long time ago), thanks to the comforting aromas of coffee and breakfast cooking on the griddle, and the hustle-bustle of a busy diner!
Our server was friendly, prompt, and efficient.  No complaints there.  Still no complaints when we received our orders of the daily special of NY steak and eggs (which came with hash browns and choice of bread: muffin, toast, pancake http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/black-bear-diner-goodyear?select=q7dK8yU76GIyLxt6KVjrHQ#q7dK8yU76GIyLxt6KVjrHQ , or biscuit) and a plate of biscuits and gravy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/black-bear-diner-goodyear?select=EpBzkp0dH2QNe4m-F7F4dQ#EpBzkp0dH2QNe4m-F7F4dQ  Loved that she asked us how we wanted the steak cooked- medium rare to medium, please. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/black-bear-diner-goodyear?select=30v8SVaQU2f7AcTsPIRd2w#30v8SVaQU2f7AcTsPIRd2w  Oh, and she was thoughtful enough to split our entree when all we had asked was to have an extra plate. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/black-bear-diner-goodyear?select=RCVOGduEtBFY2S63er9qlA#RCVOGduEtBFY2S63er9qlA  She even remembered that I didn't want to have any of the eggs... cool.
Everything was delicious!  The color/temperature of the steak was perfect!  I did ask for the hash browns be cooked extra crispy, and it wasn't, but no big deal, since we had the lovely biscuits and gravy to contend with, too.  (I suggest you get your fill of the B&G when fresh, 'cause they're not good eats hours later, most notably the gravy... ugh.)
Glad to find another breakfast eatery to take my Mom to!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast I have had since I have been coming to Vegas. We arrived two hours ago and were looking for food but wanted breakfast. I'm so glad we chose Black Bear Diner it will become a tradition for years to come. The cinnamon French toast will melt in your mouth. Rich in flavor and the portion size is generous. The staff is energetic, professional and very knowledgeable about the menu. We will be back"}
{"text":"great restaurant... decent prices.... good service... and lots of food for your dollar. love this place . atmosphere is great always playing oldies."}
{"text":"So glad we got a Black Bear Diner on the West side on town.  I visited it for brunch on Sunday and we were not disappointed.  FAST service and the place is so clean.  Big portions kept me full all day.   I did have a little wait but nothing bad for a weekend morning.  I will be returning."}
{"text":"Great diner! Friendly staff, spacious and the interior is awesome! We were seated fast in a booth. Menu that is extended yet not overwhelming. Plenty of healthy choices too, which I loved and I went for the healthiest plate on the menu: the Acapulco scramble. I replaced the toast with a hash brown. Scramble that was not over seasoned, most places have too much salt well here definitely not! That's great! Side of fruit. Good amount of hash brown. Great dish!
My partner had the bears choice: eggs, sausage, French toast. He always takes this, it's his favorite. Their sauces and ketchup are non GMO and home made!
We had a hard time resisting the pies and the front desk, maybe next time we should try one!:)
Good value for good service and diner food. Will come back!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place to have breakfast. The food is really good and the service is usually outstanding. The only issue as it gets very busy and you're going to have to wait if you don't get there early, but then again that's the sign of a good place"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here and I was very impressed.  Was seated right away and given beverages immediately.  After asking the waitress for her recommendations we ordered.  She was willing to customize our orders without complaint.  The food was served quickly and correctly.  It was also delicious!

We were given excellent service and checked on for refills, etc.  I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"A little bit out of the way, but the check-in staff at the Cosmopolitan recommended it as a great diner. It's a chain restaurant, but has a down-home feel.

The place was hopping on Sunday morning with hungover twenty-somethings, families with young kids and elderly lovebirds just getting out from the Methodist church. It was loud, a little too loud for my hungover head.

Servers were oddly hipster for this type of a restaurant but hey, they were interesting to look at (more interesting than the 1000 different types of stuffed bears crammed into every visible space). 

I ordered the chicken fried steak, my friend ordered the veggie omelet. Both plates were MASSIVE and neither one of us was able to finish. The chicken fried steak was so crunchy and toothsome and seasoned perfectly, I'm dying just thinking about the little piece I left on my plate. The seasoned red potatoes were nice, too. I also noticed that their bread is thick-sliced and looked delicious, but alas, I was too full to touch them.

Prices are ok, $6-$10 for a plate of breakfast, but keep in mind how much you're getting! I wish the noise level was significantly lower, but in a big open room it's hard to control the volume of a crowd. If you're in Vegas, check out Black Bear Diner on Tropicana. It's far, but your stomach will thank you for hours."}
{"text":"A great find thanks to locals. This diner gives you more for your buck. We were tired of casino food, so I asked around. Located only 3.2 miles from the strip, I was very pleased to find this place. When you first walk in, the hospitality is amazing. We were greeted and seated almost immediately. Go early, the line gets long. Cindi was our waitress. Southern hospitality at its best. Coffee was strong but with great flavor. Fresh squeezed OJ!!!
Now for the food.....
I ordered the sausage scramble. 1 giant biscuit topped with 2 large, homemade pieces of sausage, scrambled eggs and covered in gravy. This came with a side of hash browns that was huge! The plate was filled to the max, all portions are twice as big as they should be. Come hungry, or plan to take left overs. I had trouble finishing the meal, but I made it through.

We went the next day because of the service and food. I ordered the corn beef and hash. Home made corn beef and hash, so good. Nothing canned at this diner. Again with the OJ and coffee. You won't have to eat lunch after a breakfast here.

Pricing was great, like going to Denny's, but with twice the food!!! You get what you pay for and then some!!!"}
{"text":"Best Black Bear ever!!! Awesome staff! Love coming here! You'll never leave hungry that's for sure!"}
{"text":"We decided to cheat on our diet and reward our bodies with some fatness. My girlfriend had great things to say the last time she was here. Location is great so I said sure why not? When we entered the restaurant, I was immediately taken back by the layout. Cabin log walls, animal statues, and a jukebox playing classic soul music. If you love The Lodge restaurant on Mt. Charleston, you will feel right at home here. 

Our waitress was friendly, upbeat, and on point with her service.  I ordered the BBQ Western Bacon Burger well done, and I was in burger heaven. Our waitress brought ranch before I could ask for it! It was a great touch to their perfectly seasoned fries. My girlfriend ordered the Ribeye Steak Medium Rare. Sooo good!! 

My only gripe is the Jim Carrey looking guy who helped ring us up. Before I finished paying, he was asking the waitress if the previous group had left a tip. Instead of asking her in the back, he thought it was best to openly shout across the restaurant. Not the best idea, but everything else was so good I'm willing to overlook it. No lie, I will definitely be back to try more off their menu!"}
{"text":"Good food with very large portions.  I had the taco salad which was great and my wife had the pot roast which was also very yummy."}
{"text":"When I visit an area I feel it my privilege to sample the local fare.  I pride myself on trying to support local business before resorting to chains but I feel it my civic duty to let the good folks that support this local establishment know that Blackbear Diner may perhaps be doing you a disservice.  I have a rating system that I only share in detail to those closest to my heart.  By such system this place is barely better than McDonald's. In terms of taste, this place easily has the edge over McDonald's.  It also has the advantage in terms of customer service, but no surprise there. 

BTW Support Local Business, you'll still find individuals who care about how you feel about their business.  

Ok, back to my review.  I ordered the Cinnamon Roll French Toast & side of Bacon.  I could just imagine those cinnamon rolls piping hot & crunchy slathered in butter, dripping with warm dark maple syrup.  What I got was room temperature,  soggy, fried cinnamon bread.  Imagine my disappointment when my little dream came crashing down into a sad, soggy reality.  I'm sure for most people the fact that these folks here are the crème de la crème of hospitality & service should make up for bad food.  I am here to enjoy my meal.  The staff did their job.  I certainly enjoyed the warm family type atmosphere!  Where this place fell flat for me, is the food.  So half of my experience was missing.  No matter who you are or where you are in life you know that if half of anything is missing it's incomplete.   What was an incomplete in school boys & girls? An F.  This place, as charming as it is, needs to do better.  My advice, fire the cook."}
{"text":"Great food and service! So glad to live down the street from this place and their prices are the best! The restaurant is always impeccable and food is ready fast! The employees are friendly which is great and it's very cute! Love the Bears"}
{"text":"It's diner food. If you don't know what that means, stop by and you will quickly find out. I would guess that their breakfast is better than lunch/dinner, but I'm not sure I will be back to find out. Service was good. Lots of messy tables when we first got there, but they were cleaned up rather quickly after we sat down. The boy cleaning the tables used the same rag to wipe down the booth seat and then went straight to the tabletop with it. Grossed me out a little. A big no no in the restaurant industry."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with the family. Staff and our waitress were extremely friendly and helpful.  Probably the best service I've had in a restaurant. However, the food was nothing spectacular. My husband enjoyed his burger, it was just ok, my reuben sandwich was missing sauerkraut (there was less than a tsp scattered on it), and corned beef was just ok. My daughters pizza was frozen, not fresh, and she wouldn't eat. After taking a bite, and spitting it out, I realized why, it was old, & cheese was sour! Waitress took it back and off the bill. My son had a grilled cheese sandwich, no complaints. But then, we had the dessert, bread pudding, and some sort of chocolate cake with ice cream. Both were by far the worst things I've ever eaten in my life. They tasted like they were made in a microwave or something. Taste and texture were way off. Despite the great service and ok food, I'm hesitant to go back there just because of the dessert alone. They shouldn't even be allowed to sell that crap. FYI, we didn't try the pies because they're made with lard which we don't eat."}
{"text":"Bear-lickious!!!! We were seated right away by the manager and offered us something to drink immediately. Waiter, Donna, came quickly also made good semi-suggestions and walked away - wasn't very helpful.  

I had the Volcano which I absolutely loved the cream cakes - very large. Was expecting something unique but was just a regular breakfast of eggs, bacon, sausage and pancakes. Their bacon is think and crispy-must have! 

My hubby had the California dream which of course I had to taste it was an all 5 Star choice! From the avocado slices with the eggs to the spinach mixed in the yolk sauce and red potatoes. And although the potatoes were incorrect the first time ( they brought hash-browns) those tasted awesome too and the waiter was quick to bring the red potatoes."}
{"text":"Portion sizes are huge and staff is fantastic!
I REALLY enjoyed my breakfast here.  The potatoes could have been cooked a bit longer, but the biscuit and gravy made my day! I also can't remember when I've had a ham-steak that good! You guys really know your stuff."}
{"text":"I came here a couple of months ago. Arrived to the location and the wait was about 30 minutes, and yes, my first time here. After waiting we were seated and given the menu. I don't recall the exact name of the food that I ordered but it was delicious. The staff was friendly and the customers were actually very patient, no upset clients due to waiting. My husband is very picky when it comes to breakfast food, but he really enjoyed the food he ordered."}
{"text":"I have avoided all of the Black Bear Diners I've seen over the years for some reason, but I finally got to try it out at this location. I'm sad I didn't do so sooner... much better than Village Inn, Denny's, Waffle House, and IHOP! (Among all of the other restaurants just like them... minus Cracker Barrel, which is still my favourite!)

We decided to walk down here while waiting for oil changes at Brake Masters, and they weren't busy at all because of the strange time we decided to eat out of boredom (3:30pm-ish, I think.) It was the best option we had within walking distance in the area, even though I had always avoided/dreaded going there for some reason. However, I remembered possibly seeing something on Yelp about them being good, and like I said... best option in the area :P So, we went in, ordered our food, had great service and great food! Huge portions, and we weren't really that hungry to begin with... we probably could've just shared something if we had known how huge the meals were! :)

Overall, good price, good service, and good food. I would recommend this place, especially given its competition in the area... although the nearby IHOP actually wasn't that bad. I was forced to eat at that IHOP one day, but was pleasantly surprised :)"}
{"text":"The restaurant was nice, we have visited one in Tucson ,AZ once before and enjoyed the food. 
This visit to Vegas, we decided to try this one. Our order was taken, in a reasonable amount of time, not a lot of customers during our visit. The waitress was fairly attentive I ordered the fish and chips and the wife ordered the meatloaf dinner. The fish was very hot, but the mashed potatoes, gravy and French fries were at room temperature and the Wife had a room temperature meal also. I sent mine back for a hot meal. Moments later the Manager was at our table trying to make everything right.  She fixed the issue and went over and beyond, though we were not upset about the situation. This place has a good review and things happen, how they are handled is what makes the place returnable. 
We will be back."}
{"text":"Let me say we loved this location. Always friendly and good service great food. This last visit March 29th around 530pm was less than expected. 

Salads were skimpy not the usually hearty serving. I have ordered the salmon dinner before and couldn't wait to dig in.  My salmon was over cooked and dry, lacked an seasoning as stated on the menu. The steamed spinach underneath was cold, while my husbands steamed spinach was hot and delish. The mixed vegetables that were served with the dinner had seen better days, shriveled and not freshly made per usual. Best part of my dinner was the baked potato. 

The waitress was made aware of my dis-satifaction Hunter was defensive and never returned to the table. We never saw her again during our time in the restaurant. 

The manager was attentive when we asked them to turn up the AC the place was freezing in our section. When dining do not look up at the aC registers, omg someone get them a ladder and a bucket of soap and water or a can of paint please ! Interior is beginning to look run down and not cleanliness is less than to be desired. 

Did they get a new cook, or manager? I will think twice before I return."}
{"text":"I had such an amazing experience here! Our server Abel was great. He was fast and making sure everyone was taken care of. I'm only going to be here for a few more days and might have to come back. Their portions are big. The sausage patties were flavorful. We ordered chicken and waffles but got too full to eat them. Services was excellent and food was delicious! The decorations were cute. The menu is on newspaper, loved it. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Sweet Cream Pancakes - Killer ! Best American breakfast in the area. Great service. Lively. We love Black Bear. Big Portions, hot and steaming and fast!"}
{"text":"Definitely going to be coming back here again. A country bear atmosphere, nice and clean. Everyone that works there was very friendly and made you feel at home. The menu is inside the newspaper they hand you... took me a second to figure that out :) 

Pancakes and Eggs Benedict were delicious! The desert looked very appetizing, however the breakfast was so large, I had no room left. Nonetheless I look forward to trying it when I return again. 

They have several credo's they try to follow. If you need changes they're willing to accommodate if possible. I did need changes to the potatoes, they didn't get it exactly right, however I'm sure if I am more clear of my needs in the future, they'll do everything they can to make it right. 

Also a small add, however very welcomed, is that they have flavored creamer for the coffee. Always a pleasant surprise!

{"text":"My husband and I share the Grizz. Oh, so good. We ordered take out this morning. We enjoy this place but expect a wait as it is very popular. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Black Bear on Tropicana is the BEST! It is our Friday night \"go-to\"  place to eat, mainly because of the great food and server Marlene! They know us by name there and also that we only sit where Marlene is serving! Thanks for making this a great place to go in Las Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Ive eaten breakfast for years at Black Bear. For me its hands down the best breakfast joint in west valley. I believe they do also have lunch and dinner, never have made it over there for that."}
{"text":"My in-laws had just landed and we needed some lunch. They were staying at the Marriot just across the street and the woman at the front desk recommended we come here. Lucky for me, this place has been on my to-do list!

Mr. And Mrs. H shared a burger with a side of French fries and onion rings, hubby ordered the Rueben and I ordered the pineapple Upside-down pancakes with a side of fruit and bacon. 

I got to try some of the burger and onion rings. While the onion rings were just fine, the burger with avocado was a solid choice. 

While my pancakes were pleasing to the eye (they were pretty huge!) I have to say that they were just fine. The pineapple was baked inside, which made it loose most of the juice that you would keep in a pineapple Upside-down cake. Basically, I wish I'd had a ton more pineapple. 

I think my husband's Rueben was the real winner of the day! It was piled high with plenty of meat and all the flavors were spot on. Even the roasted rye bread that looked pretty ordinary had fantastic texture - toasted on the outside and soggy on the inside. 

Both couples decided to share a Chocolate Cream Pie. These things are huge! They're served in a very deep bowl. There's an Oreo crust, the chocolate Cream which was a nice balance between pudding and mousse, a thick layer of whipped cream and is sprinkled with chocolate chips. While the whipped cream tasted heavy and oily to me, I loved the other components. The Oreo crust and chocolate chips added some great texture. And frankly, I could've gone for five more layers of the Oreo crumble!!

I certainly hope to visit here again soon. When we do, I would totally revisit that Rueben. Then maybe try the Chocolate Lava cake for dessert!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat, awesome bacon, great service, clean and great food. Bryna was an excellent waitress, made us laugh, very responsive and when we return I will ask for her section."}
{"text":"Loved it! The place is super busy but we got right in. We had a really great, personable server who knew his stuff. My omelet was great! My sister is coming to visit for the 4th of July holiday and we'll be taking her there!"}
{"text":"I've been so excited to try this place out and was especially happy when this location opened right by my place. I love the decor and small town feel, but man is their service terrible.

Our waiter started by not greeting us until being seated for about 5-10 mins. We immediately ordered coffees and waters. He returns only with two cups of coffee, no creamers provided and no waters. Throughout our meal we constantly had to help ourselves to creamers on adjacent tables since it was impossible to flag down our own server. We also needed to ask him for an extra set of silverware, the side of ranch he forgot with the meal and twice for a take out box. I mean it was a holiday weekend and I understood it was busy, but come on man. 

If it weren't for the amazing food we honestly probably would have left. I had the tradition eggs Benedict. It was cooked perfectly and the hash browns that also came with were super fresh and definitely homemade. My boyfriend had the tri tip dip, it was seasoned just right and not dry at all.

Please please please get your service together because I'd love to come back again for the amazing food."}
{"text":"Well I tried this restaurant on Sat morning , I am use to eating at some great places with excellent food and wonderful service.. 
The breakfast was ok, ham wasn't tasty and tasted kind of cheap.. but the service was exceptional!!. A girl named Shantel I remembered from the M Casino Hash House works there!..I saw her and remembered how wonderful and kind she was.. we once again had EXCELLENT SERVICE from her and always a sweet smile.. hostess were kind and all the employees seemed nice.. sometimes where the food is not up to par the servers and kindness makes up for it!! Good Job on the hiring BLACK BEAR.. all restaurants could use a SHANTEL.. she represents professionalism and kindness from within naturally!!! 
Me and my family will return for the service alone.. and maybe a better piece of Ham:)"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or lunch. I like that they offer fresh food as I ordered the hash and eggs that were excellent. No canned hash as they state on the menu and it was correct! Good portions and great service. They are also in IDINE so as of this review so got my discount."}
{"text":"My first time here and I must say I was impressed. The waiter didn't waste time getting my wife and I order. We went on a Friday which is the day of all you can eat fish. That day they happen to not have all the fish for the fry so the manager Mike mad every effort to get the customers what they want so he had the cooks cook cod instead and he had it come out fast. The atmosphere was cool. The bathroom was not cool hence my 4 star instead of 5. Had that bathroom been clean i would have given this place a 5 star. The burgers are big. The manager Mike is really organized and great at getting his team on point. Kudos. i will be going again and bring the family to enjoy the experience this place."}
{"text":"I love Black Bear Diner because they have the best fried chicken. Came tonight and found they changed the menu and no longer offer it. I am devastated. Almost want to leave."}
{"text":"Awesome little place. Our service was prompt, friendly, and helpful! Our food portions were huge and delicious! I would have eaten here again given the chance. Worth a try for anyone willing to check it out."}
{"text":"Had a great experience today! Food was delicious and hearty. Staff was super friendly and the Supervisor, Marlene, was a joy."}
{"text":"I once ate hear years ago with some friends and really enjoyed it.  Then recently my friends told me that this place has gone down hill some..

Well...

I beg to differ.  I love this place.  I love breakfast.. so when you put the two together, you get a nice marriage of good food and plenty of it.  There is so much stuff to try here and I dont know where to begin on what, but just open the cool newspaper menu and go to town. Im sure this place is not for everyone, but it always seems crowded on a Sunday morning.

The staff has always been friendly and they have a Jack Black look-a-like working there too... pretty cool stuff.. lol."}
{"text":"First time having a horrible experience here. Will be back to write my review. 5 plates. 5 errors. Not to include errors made by staff. Never coming back."}
{"text":"The breakfast is delicious no matter what you try. I had The Scrambowl... lots of food for the price! The servers are also super friendly. Definitely glad Laveen finally added a breakfast place because that's what it was missing."}
{"text":"If you love waffles like I do, especially for dinner, this is THE place. Is it fancy? No. Is it super original? Not at all. But is it the best cheap breakfast foods around? I think so. When I'm craving breakfast for dinner, I come here. Service is usually decent and food comes out fairly fast. Their Belgian waffle is sweet and fluffy, everything a waffle should be. I usually get it with the bacon because, let's be honest, sweet and salty is awesome."}
{"text":"Texas-sized portions of home cooked food. American fare, good quality. Smoothest experience I've ever had bringing a service dog. Just like a corner diner I would go to back home in Texas. Nice hot sauce options, also a plus for a Texan."}
{"text":"I'm posting this with everyone understanding that I always give people second chances. In this case I gave them 3 chances.The first time I went they had barely open and were still probably organizing and trying to get a rhythm and that's why I didn't post anything the first time. The service was so slow it was ridiculous there was only maybe 10 tables that they were serving and they had probably double the amount of servers I had ever seen them have since I've been there. The food came out cold and they replaced the hashbrowns which were the coldest. The second time I went there they ran out of creamer for the coffee so I literally had to walk to Circle K to get French vanilla creamer for me and my family.The food that time came out burnt. We then began to eat it as we knew it was going to be a while if they were going to replace it I have to manager come over and she gave us a free pie and gave us a discount on the food.  The third time we went for dinner and the burger was not medium which I always like my burger to be a little pink in the middle this burger was completely well done. I then called the manager over again and told her that the food was overcooked and she gave us another free pie and said sorry. 

If you like your food over cooked and free pies this is the place for you. Unfortunately I cannot go back no more as I gave him multiple chances to make things right and to make my experience unforgettable however after the third try I can no longer go back! 

Now mind you from the beginning I could to give them a nasty review but I didn't because again I am fair and like to try things out more than once to see if they've gotten their act together and unfortunately this place did it. I'm not telling you not to try it as I've heard great things about other locations I'm just saying this particular time these were my experiences."}
{"text":"This diner is 1 of over 67 Black Bears on the west coast. I've been here more than I can count,  Again, for my egg white omelette. They are great at it. Their hash browns are delish when ordered well done. I've never had anything else.  This is a totally low key place & the many servers try hard to please each guest. This place is rarely slow. There are people of all ages who come in here for breakfasts & lunches & I'm pretty certain most return. It's a cute place for kids. The place is aligned from above with hundreds of stuffed bears. They also sell pies & cakes , bear claws :)as well in case u need to bring home some sweets. . The manager is an older sweet greek man who will come by your table to make sure all is well with your meal. He is a doll. Love him.. It is quite an extensive diner menu with an ambiance more like that of northern Cal., Colorado our vt..:) I think it's all their bears(: takes u out of vegas for a bit, which I dont mind at all."}
{"text":"Can I go negative stars? This was the worst experience I have had in a long time at a restaurant. Started off well enough. We were sat in in a good time frame. Then we watched them sit everyone else and then we ordered after 10 min. And then we watched every one around us get seated order and get their food. We waited just I e an hour and no food. The table next to is had to tell them to get a manager because they were in shock that we did not get our food and no one was responding to is flagging them down. We finally talked to a manager who said they were doing their best and that was it! She could not explain why everyone but is got their food. I will never go back to this place and recommend that no one go there. Worst place I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"Im a fan they have the best pancakes according to my hubby my kids beg to go ....at least i dont have to cook i can pick um up! 
ps..i love it too!"}
{"text":"My waitress what a sweetheart, honestly just felt like hugging her!!! Place is well kept, portions are good, very home made feel... I enjoy the atmosphere very comfy. I will always come back."}
{"text":"Never been to this location, it is very different inside from the one we normally go to but this one is closest to home. This location is very much like a diner. We ordered the fish fry it  comes with fries coleslaw and hush puppies. The waitress was nice and attentive, the young man who seated us was very polite as well. The fish was crispy, I didn't like the coleslaw it has an over powering taste of vinegar, my fries were soggy. Women's restroom has a very strong sewer smell. Although I do like Black Bear I will not return to this location, there's a big difference in the food and over all experience here."}
{"text":"Order the pancakes.  Even if you wanna get one of their other delicious entrees, order the pancakes.  For later.  They're that good."}
{"text":"Okay, we've been to this place twice now and both visits were very successful. They have really good quality food and the plates that they serve our enormous! I can't imagine what their food cost must be. Anyhow both times we went for breakfast. The first time I had eggs Benedict and the soft-boiled eggs were cooked perfect and the hollandaise sauce was creamy buttery and wonderful. Last week I had the corned beef hash and it was fresh and wonderful; it must be made in house. The coffee is very good as well. The ding on the star level comes from the unpredictable service as it can be slow at times; especially when you want to check to pay and leave. Overall this place is a home-run and we'll put it on the rotation even though there are quite a few breakfast places hearing Gilbert AZ."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in Vegas. It's in kind of a ghetto shopping center. The portions are so huge that I can't even finish half of my serving. They have lighter portions, which I still can't finish. I love their biscuits and gravy. Everything I've tried on their breakfast menu is awesome. Even better I believe they serve breakfast all day."}
{"text":"I love the black bear diner. The last time we went, the food was ok as was the service.  So, it was a but of a letdown. The deserts are always on point though. It could be cleaner and  the pattymelt could be better. But all in all its an ok place to eat."}
{"text":"I always see people recommending the breakfast here, it is good but do yourself a favor and try the tri tip dinner with mixed veggies and baked beans. The tri tip is always juicy and seasoned very well. The baked beans are a little sweet and spicy, perfect with the tri tip and the mixed veggies are comprised of zucchini, squash, broccoli, red onion and carrots - lightly seasoned and steamed. I also highly recommend the \"Bob's big bear bacon burger\"  but keep in mind the burger has thousand island on it, I recommend ordering it without, unless that's your thing. The fries are always made fresh and super crispy, if you try to eat less starchy food or can't handle the behemoth burger AND fries (the burger is massive) then go with a dinner salad (the blue cheese dressing is the best I've had outside of higher end steak houses) both dishes are fantastic and never disappoint."}
{"text":"Great food...everything was fresh! Servers are nice welcoming and are nice to each other and support each other. The hostesses need some serious training for all the seats to be open and they tell you 25 minutes. We sat at bar!!"}
{"text":"This is a 11 yr. old's review! I've been going here since i was 3 and I remember everything! (I remember when i wanted to color on the walls lol) Anyways. The food is great and the decor is good. That's pretty much it so.. bye!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location several times and I really like the smaller portion Tuna Melt plate. Plenty of food and the servers have all been very friendly and attentive. The desserts look huge and amazing but I've never had the room for them after the main entree."}
{"text":"I don't know how they maintain a small town hospitality for a relatively big chain, but they do! Great staff, massive portions, and half the wait time of an average brunch place. They treated our party of 15 like we were dinner guests, and no issue splitting checks. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Don't come here planning on having their all-you-can-eat fish fry on Fridays, uless you get here early. They don't know how to plan, and run out by 6:15pm. Rediculous! Must cater to the retired community, because cleary, the working community doesn't stand a chance. Somebody PLEASE get this manager some supply management training!"}
{"text":"Service was below descent. Sweet cream waffle was good. Hardly anyone in there but server seemed to not have time to attend our table. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here on Monday and the place still hasn't been updated. Insides show signs of ware and tear and carpeting needs to be replaced. Shorthanded and wait staff was running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Menu prices have risen and the quality of the food, as well as the quantity was not up to par."}
{"text":"Food was good, nothing over the top. 

Biscuit was a delight with the different style of hash browns. Bacon scramble special was my choice and it tasted good. 

Downgraded from a 4 star to a 3 only because the coffee was horrible! Maybe bottom of the pot, but still when I come to a breakfast restaurant I want a nice cup of coffee."}
{"text":"This is the go-to restaurant when none of my friends can decide where to eat because nothing here can ever go wrong. The food is delicious and hearty! I am always left feeling very full and satisfied. There is a great lot to choose from and sometimes it's very difficult to choose. Lol. The atmosphere is cozy (and has stuffed bears!) which is all you could really ask for in a diner setting. The service is very consistent! I always feel so welcome here, and every server I've ever had has always been both friendly and helpful. Towards brunch, it gets quite busy, so come early! It's worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is literally within walking distance from my apartment, yet I have passed by it daily. This morning I was hungry for breakfast and had a lot of things to do so I thought I would try something close. I have noticed the parking lot is usually full, so I thought it must be good. I had no idea what type of food they had or what to expect.

It was Sunday morning just around 9:30 and I was fortunate to be able to walk in and instantly have a table. The server was very friendly and she checked back often always refilling my coffee. The menu is a little newspaper and it's a bit overwhelming with many options, but I finally settled on the volcano. It is described as three pancakes, 2 sausage links, 2 bacon strips, and an egg. The pancakes are three different sizes and stacked to create a volcano with the egg on top. It was under $9 and I was surprised at the size of it! I attempted but could not finish it. The big pancake was left uneaten. They do have a smaller option for around $6 and that might be the better way to go unless you have just returned from a month long trip through the jungle or plan to share with someone. 

The server continued to check on me and even offered up a to go cup of coffee. I don't know how I have overlooked this place but based on the experience today, I would put it right at the top of best spots in town for breakfast. I will say come early because by the time I was leaving the lobby was full, people were milling around the parking lot, and the wait to be seated was 15 minutes."}
{"text":"First time,never going back again. If you go there know that all the pancakes are sweet batter pancakes even if the menu doesn't specify it. Our server was Samara,got that from the receipt she left on the table five minutes after we got our food. She was beyond unhelpful. Since we got there we felt as if she was bothered with our presence. When we told her it was our first time there she left us alone for a while instead of explaining about the difference in their pancakes or offering suggestions,she only told us about the today special. I understand if you are swamped and you don't have much time to dedicate to your table but it was a Wednesday morning she had maybe 4 tables max and we were the only new one she got. We saw her just hanging out in the back multiple times. Whenever I tried to ask something it felt as if she didn't really know the food or maybe she was just bothered I asked. So i stopped asking and got food I didn't like. So i just ate 2 strips of bacon and one egg for $8.50 . My husband got steak and eggs with country potatoes. The potatoes had no flavor and were undercooked. just never happening again especially with the \"Cracked egg\" not too far from there that has amazing breakfast!"}
{"text":"Received the best service ever by waitress Byrna!
She was prompt, friendly, courteous and knowledgeable!   She is a keeper.  Food was excellent and the price was right!   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty average, came for breakfast on a busy morning.  The service was good, we were able to get a table pretty fast and get food quickly.  I think because it was thanksgiving and many other places were closed it was extra busy."}
{"text":"Meh... It's a nice change from IHOP when I'm craving breakfast for dinner. The portions were large, but nothing really stood out like i had hoped.  I'll be back to try their huckleberry options though for sure."}
{"text":"11 am Monday morning and it was lined up out the door! They have a lot going on at this little diner but it is a well oiled machine and they do it all well.  Great service.  Great food.  Sign up for their newsletter and get a free coffee and bear claw. Kids would love all of the bear decor."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service for dinner. I had pot roast, kids had spaghetti and hamburger. Pot roast tasted canned, like Dinty Moore. Baked potato as overcooked. Green beans were terrible, tasted like Del Monte.  Soup was no better than Progresso and corn muffin wasn't bad. That dish was a C- or a D+

BUT kids reported very good hamburger. Spaghetti was reportedly better than average but not great. Meatballs tasted very good to me. Milkshake was very good. 

Prices were average. Heard the man behind me complimenting the salad, said it was wonderful. 

All the employees were very friendly and helpful. I'd be proud of them if I were the owner. 

Maybe I just had a bad batch of pot roast. I'll give them another try. 3 stars for now but may upgrade on return."}
{"text":"Server was super sweet but you could tell she was overwhelmed with her tables and new to the restaurant business.
My kids loved the French toast, eggs, and pancake breakfast! They ate the whole thing (extremely rare since they are both so picky)! The decor reminds you of an old diner which I absolutely love! The newspapers are nice to have to keep busy while waiting for your food. My only complaint would be to have servers who are veterans to the business on the weekends instead of the gals who are new to serving and haven't figured out their rhythm yet. Or, have a veteran train them on how to better delegate their time. We had to walk up front and ask for new silverware since my youngest dropped his and our server only came back to drop the check.... No prebussing, and nobody to ask how our food came out. Little frustrating but, not a huge deal. Luckily, our orders were correct and nobody needed a refill. However, I'd like to think that if an employee is struggling to keep up, other servers or management would easily notice and help pull her outta the weeds. #TeamWork"}
{"text":"Great food, good service, reasonable prices, always hits the spot. This is by far my favorite breakfast spot my girlfriend and I always agree when we come here for lunch or breakfast."}
{"text":"Great food. You def get your money's worth. Huge. I mean huge portions. Side note if there is a line and you want to wait make sure you sign your name on the notepad by rthe cash register.  We didn't know that and one other party signed in before we realized so we just ate at the bar. No wait."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast on a Sunday morning. It  was very crowded but the wait wasn't too bad. The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Ourwaitress Brittney was excellent! The service was quick, friendly and efficient. The breakfasts were huge, very filling and properly prepared. Make sure you are hungry before you get breakfast at this place! I highly recommend The Black Bear Diner."}
{"text":"I came here from driving 3 hours to dine alone late at night on 2/10/18. Was in a very depressed mood. My waiter Gavin noticed it and talked to me for a bit and lifted my mood. Not only did he have great customer service he turned my entire night around. Need more employees like that   left a 10 dollar tip for him at the end of his shift."}
{"text":"Do not eat here.  The service is beyond slow.  Today it was very empty there were several servers talking among themselves.  I waited over 10 minutes before being approached.  The guy asked if I was ready.  I told him I had been waiting over 10 minutes and left $3.00 for the iced tea that the hostess got me.  Never again."}
{"text":"We have been here three times now! Donna was amazing to us last week and today Dre was absolutely amazing!!! We will certainly be back! The quality of food and the service is perfect!"}
{"text":"My family and I ate at the Black Bear diner on las Vegas blvd last night, and it was nothing short of perfection.  I'm a very picky eater and I thought everything I ate had the BEST flavor of any restaurant I'd ever been to! I had the 2 egg breakfast with the chicken fried steak and my mom and bro both had the 2 egg with hamsteak breakfast. Fabulous! Best breakfast for dinner we could possibly ask for. Folks that work here are very nice and they really care about their customers.  The atmosphere is very cozy and I usually hate eating out but this place is 5 stars! 10 stars if I could give it that high of a rating!"}
{"text":"This was most likely the most delicious breakfast I've ever had! The pancakes were perfectly cooked, meaning not too hot, nor cold. They had no cold or uncooked parts, and no burned pieces at all! The hash browns were also cooked amazingly. They had the most delightful texture as well as taste. As for the eggs, they were scrambled, and delicious as everything else. The service was pristine, as the workers are very nice and easy to talk to. Overall, this was an experience fit for royalty."}
{"text":"Went here and wanted to get some great breakfast because of the reviews.  I ordered take out and the breakfast was called \"The Grizz\" which included two pancakes, bacon, sausage, eggs and hash browns which where all pretty decent tasting.  My issue here was with customer service.  Amelia who took my order was very rude and had her back turned towards me after asking what I had ordered, after waiting for about 5 minutes another staff member asked if I had been helped, I appreciated her concern as she made sure the meal was coming out and I let her know I was ready to pay.  Just couldn't get past the lack of customer service of one employee, every one else was very personable."}
{"text":"Polite and kind staff, great food, clean ambience. No complaints.  Had chorizo omlette and french toast plate. Next time we will try lunch and dessert menu! Coffee was high in my opinion but really there are no \"real\" diners in west vally in my experience so far... so this place was a pleasant treat! Its a lil drive for us. But we will come back again for sure. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"A good break from the Vegas buffets. It's nice to be somewhere where there's no more slot machine noises."}
{"text":"Bacon cakes were delicious! The biscuits are huuuuge. The chicken fried steak was amazing. Good spot off the strip for anyone visiting. Came on a Saturday only waited 10 mins got a table, but it was busy. Good service, food came out quick and the waitress kept our drinks filled. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Best diner I've have eaten at, in two weeks staying right next door i have tried the country fried steak, cheeseburger with onion rings, chicken strip with fries and everything was delicious and couldn't be fresher.

I've eaten at Dennys and other diners where I leave feeling g like I wasted my money on crap food but not this place. Great jobs by the cooks, you guys are great at what you do. I can't wait to get out of work tomorrow so I can stop by and try something new."}
{"text":"Excellent service!! The food is always fresh, delicious and hot. The prices are always reasonable and the portions are huge. The variety of choices is quite extensive but there is definitely something for everyone. My personal favorites are the cobb salad, Bob's big burger (the bun is amazing), tri-tip dip, and anything with gravy. I love this place!!"}
{"text":"Just had breakfast with the family at Black Bear. Stuffed to the gills. Boy this neighborhood needed a great diner."}
{"text":"GOOD OL DOWN HOME COOKING.. YOU'LL ALWAYS GET A GOOD MEAL AT A REASONABLE PRICE!  Large variety of food to choose from.
located just off the I-10  Dysart Rd. OPEN LATE!  that's always convenient!
This place has a small additional room great for holding any kind of  meetings!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Black Bear at Green Valley & Sunset in Henderson.  Food we had was excellent.  Service could be a little bit better.  Told girl there was 2 of us while my Husband stepped into the Restroom and sat me but forgot to bring a 2nd menu and when I ordered the drinks for the both of us she only brought 1 set of water and ice tea.  Will try their Eggs Benedict next time.  Had their Club Sandwich w/Onion Rings."}
{"text":"This is a very laid back place nothing fancy. Food is good service was great. The pancakes were my favorite, they taste like the flavor Birthday cake."}
{"text":"It was my family's first time eating here and the experience was great. The food was delicious and our server Jordan was Amazing! He was very patient with us and our two small children and was always around to make sure everything was okay and in order."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, clean and creative.  Our server was extremely polite but wasn't very attentive.  My guests breakfast came out  warm and it took another 15 minutes to get mine which was the same exact breakfast."}
{"text":"A pretty great diner experience- I was craving breakfast food at 2pm and my boyfriend was hoping to get lunch so this diner met all of our needs. Tasty food, quick service, and a really diner-y vibe. Quickly became a spot in our restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"This little dinner has gone thru a renovation at this location it's more open and not so cluttered with stuffed animals but the overall layout is nice. The in law's, hubby and I come here quite often for some lunches when they come to visit. It's a good source of choices to grab food at. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner style. The food is good for anyone who's not sure what they might be feeling they want to eat. The portion sizes are very filling and large. 

I personally haven't tried too much of their breakfast options but alot of their lunches and dinners are great. I had the turkey sandwich with fries. Hubby had chicken fried steak, it came with an egg and a huge biscuit. The In-laws ordered burgers very large! Bigger than they expected. 

Always love the home feel, friendly staff and good food! See ya next time."}
{"text":"Born and raised in Long Island, New York  the diner is an institution that is a part of my heritage. Now living in Las Vegas, my heritage was on the other side of the continent. A couple of years ago when I was motoring on W. Tropicana Avenue I hit the jackpot when I laid eyes on Black Bear Diner. It was guaranteed I would try it. After two meals there I was impressed. However, it is a drive from Henderson to Spring Valley to enjoy a diner. But something happened. Santa Claus gave Henderson residents and myself an awesome Christmas present: a brand new Black Bear Diner. This would rejuvenate a former Chili's that had been a sight for sore eyes the last couple of years. 

  When I bestow 4 star ratings and the food is 3 to 3.5 stars, exceptional service or a unique environment could top it off to that level. In the case of Black Bear Diner it is the later. The bear theme is welcoming, entertaining, and unique. When customers walk toward the entrance, a family of bear statues are an omen of what awaits inside. In the vestibule there are couple of bear statues. Inside the diner, the bear motif is prevalent. However, this location is missing the menagerie of stuffed bears that make the Tropicana Avenue Diner a quasi-stuffed bear museum. On the table, the menu is displayed on newspapers. Nearby the menu is a history of Black Bear Diner that is rich in bear lore. In its own way, Black Bear Diner reminds me more of Cracker Barrel than a greasy spoon. 

  Being a diner, there are so many choices. I visited during dinner. I selected the meat loaf diner. It included corn bread with either a soup or salad. I went with the chicken noodle soup. It was fresh and delicious. It included mixed vegetables and a choice of potato. I went with the mashed potatoes with gravy. The abundant portion equaled quantity and quality. With a bottomless Coke, it came to a little over $16 before the tip which the waitress certainly deserved. 

  The waitress was friendly and professional. It was brought to my attention that a few Black Bear Diner employees from California were assisting with the grand opening. 

  It is worth mentioning that the kitchen is exposed, where the customers could see the cooks making the food. In a way, the cooks were part of the entertainment. 

  Black Bear Diner is down the street from me. I not only intend to return to Black Bear Diner a few times. I intend to try at least three different items from their menu then ultimately incorporate them into a review update that will be part of a list of  \"restaurant in focus\" or another name I come up with. But in the mean time, \"Happy New Year!\""}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner is an icon that has stood at the corner of Jones and Tropicana for years. Contrary to what the name might imply to some people, Black Bear Diner did not start out serving bear meat. It started as an inn in Mount Shasta, California that overlooked a strawberry patch that was inhabited by both people and black bears. Approximately ninety years later Black Bear Diner seems to be a healthy business. They have several locations including this very one at the northwest corner of Tropicana Avenue and Jones Boulevard.  

 Black Bear Diner operates by six (6) credos. I have put each credo to the test. This review lists each credo with Yelping feedback. Please bear with me, while I grow my yelp into a growl while I give feedback on each of the six credos.

Credo #1: We will make Black Bear Diner a place where you can feel comfortable and relaxed. We offer you great food and an experience reminiscent of a time when a small-town restaurant was the place to go for talk, friendship and atmosphere.

A Yelper's growl: On my visits that occurred during the afternoon of June 22 and the morning of June 23, 2013; the lodge theme made me relaxed. There is nothing like a hundred stuffed bears to make me feel at ease. Black Bear Diner reminds me more of a bear themed Cracker Barrel than a small-town restaurant. The menu which mimics a newspaper and the place mats were interesting reading material. Being in the information age where friends, especially yelp friends are within the touch of a handheld device, I could say that the excellent Verizon reception contributed to making this a place for friendship.

Credo #2: We are dedicated to serving freshly prepared home cooking. From scratch sausages and biscuits to our legendary Black Bear Cobbler, everyone at Black Bear Diner goes the extra mile to provide you with the best in good old fashioned family food, prepared fresh every day.

A Yelper's growl: Based on the Shasta cheeseburger with fries that I ate on June 22 and the Bear's Choice Breakfast special that I ate on June 23; I thought that the food was good yet not extraordinary. I would have appreciated more cheese on the Shasta cheeseburger, warmer fries, and a choice of syrups and toppings for the pancakes.

Credo #3 We deliver each meal just the way you order it.

A Yelper's growl: This ought to be mentioned when the server takes your order. When I ordered the Bear's Choice Breakfast, this would have been nice if it was brought to my attention. I would of enjoyed more beacon instead of pancakes.

Credo#4: We believe in value-hearty portions of good food. We buy huge platters and we fill them, so don't be afraid to take leftovers home!

A Yelper's growl: The portions are huge. However, I feel that instead of filling up a lot of the plate with fries that they ought to replace some of them with the choice of potato salad or cole slaw. For the record fries are not the kind of food that tastes good warmed up. 


Credo #5: We feature healthy options because we care about our customers.

A Yelper's growl: I do not go to a diner, especially named Black Bear to eat healthy. I say good for them for featuring healthy options. I would like to add that all the stuffed bears and bear memorabilia was good for my mental health. Stuffed bears have a way of reducing my stress level. 

Credo #6: If you have comments that bear repeating, please tell us. If you have extraordinary service, or have something to growl about, we want to hear from you. Please visit our website to let us know how we are doing.

A Yelper's growl: Growling on business websites is not my style. My style is to growl on Yelp. With that in mind my growl of Black Bear Diner is 3  1/2 stars.

{"text":"Excellent food & service!! Love their breakfasts, especially the Pineapple Upside-down pancakes. Their homemade desserts are delicious, you have to try one, but will probably have to take it to go because their meal portions are pretty good, so we never have room to eat dessert there. Highly recommend!! Delicious home style food, wide variety on the menu."}
{"text":"Always excellent food at Black Bear. 1st time at this location, but have been to the Goodyear and Glendale locations numerous times. Great service. Best place for delicious food, large portions."}
{"text":"Excellent food & service. Homemade food. Eaten here for breakfast and dinner, always delicious food, big portions. Love this restaurant, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing cinnamon roll French toast,  great burger.  Very friendly waitress and staff.  My first visit, but I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Wow! Great breakfast and a laid back atmosphere. 

When I walked in, the first impression I had was of a small town diner where you see the old men sitting around, telling each other stories over coffee: inviting and comfortable.

The menu is interesting. Setup in the style of a 1940's newspaper, the vast menu covers all areas of down-home cooking.

I had the Country Fried Steak and eggs with country potatoes. Steak was great and the cream gravy really pleased. Eggs were ok. The wife got the California Omelet and really enjoyed it. Fresh veggies and huge chunks of avocado. The kid ordered the child's chocolate-chip pancakes with powdered sugar. Pretty sure there was more chip then cake, which pleased to no end.

Priced low for the amount and quality of the food. Would come back anytime."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place and food is good. But I order has browns and it was really dry. Waitress took 15 min to bring it"}
{"text":"Ordered the pot roast. Had an okay taste but a good amount of fat. It waitress, Crystal didn't ask if we wanted dessert and then gave us the wrong bill. This is the lady time we visit this location."}
{"text":"Bleh!  Ordered the Grizz I think it was.  Asked for crispy bacon.  I got charcoal.  You know how bacon can be overcooked to the point that it just disintegrates in your mouth?  That's what I had.  The sausage was overcooked as well.  I did like the pancakes, the eggs, and the ham.  Based on that and the decent service is the only reason this isn't a 1 star review.  Overally Blackbear is 0 for two.  Considering the breakfast I just had a Jamms, I'd be hard pressed to want to come back here."}
{"text":"Corned Beef Hash was awesome! Real shredded corned beef and large chunks of red potatoes. So much better than the canned stuff you get most places. And the prices can't be beat."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for the weekend and I came here both days. The pinapple pancakes are so gooood! The next day they were screaming my name. The manager remembered us from the day before which was really nice. The service was good but the a/c was in need of repairs. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Went here many times for breakfast.But last Friday I had my granddaughter and husband with me after I picked up my check decided to have lunch there.  Took a pic at 1205 out side the diner place was empty we got seated right away at 1255 got our order REALLY . I was pissed.  I ordered a taco salad my hubby a burger my granddaughter French fries . It wasn't busy I asked after 40 minutes where is our food.  So I was going to say something to the woman at the register but she was training a cashier and didn't ask how our meal was . What a disappointment"}
{"text":"It was our first time coming here. My husband and I loved the place UNTIL they didn't honor the offer that was given on yelp. Free coffee and bear claw if you sign up to be a bear member.  If i knew it wasnt being honores i wouldnt have ordered the freebie. Cashier guy said you needed a coupon and will receive it via email within 48 hrs. We were very unaware. There was a miscommunication between management, server and us. As far as I know, I was going based on yelp offer. Server said it's ok and we'll be taken care of at the front. Usually when yelp has offers its smooth however this is my first encounter having a problem. 
Told cashier no problem I'll pay for it. All I'm saying is they shouldn't put up offers if they don't know how to honor it.
Food and service was excellent though. Big portions."}
{"text":"Was visiting a friend and wanted to try a new breakfast place especially because breakfast is my favorite meal of the day!! Let's just say I picked the right spot they had so many choices and everything we ordered was AMAZING!! I had the country fried steak with gravy and it was one of the best I've had in a long time!! And the waffles are a must have. I will definitely be coming here again anytime I am in town!!"}
{"text":"Our first time here and now my family and I are huge fans of these restaurants  so far we been to 3 locations and same great food and the service is outstanding and no complains."}
{"text":"We visit many Black Bear Diners when we are in California and Arizona and are never disappointed. The food is good quality and the service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Great home cooked food, fast friendly service, no wait for late breakfast on a Sunday morning. Portions are huge. This is going to be our next weekend breakfast spot. Nice job to our server John."}
{"text":"Not a good experience for me although I love the Mesa location. I didn't even want to go here  but I saw one along my route. I should have kept going bc my order was completely wrong,  the fries were so salty and my french toast was soggy. That's what I get for trying new places. But what I notice more was that servers really don't want to be bothered with you. Anyway, for a person that dines out a lot I am definitely not returning. Customer service means a lot to me."}
{"text":"It was time for lunch and we just passed Black Bear Diner.  However, since we hadn't tried it, we decided to turn around and give it a try.

We loved the menu.  There were lots of choices.  My husband settled for the potato soup and I ordered the lunch portion of chicken fried steak.
The potato soup wasn't the best.  It tasted more like a gravy.  Thus, the bowl wasn't finished.

The chicken fried steak was delicious and we both eat it along with the real mashed potatoes.  That was delicious.  We were surprised at the size of it considering I had ordered the small portion.  

We would definitely return but wouldn't order the soup."}
{"text":"We had never been to a Black Bear Diner. We wanted a not fancy dinner at a reasonable price. For what we wanted it was good. I had the Chicken Fried Steak. It was good but fried a little too long. Mashed potatoes and gravy were good and the green beans were canned beans with bacon and onion thrown in. Coming from the South this is typical for green beans. The minestrone soup was regular institutional soup that probably came in a frozen brick. I liked it. My wife had the meat loaf which was very good. Being \"seniors\" and not being terribly hungry we had the smaller portions and it was perfect for us. I should add that we had corn bread muffins and they were very good. Don't expect gourmet dining but expect good down home food. We will go there again."}
{"text":"The Black Bear diner has a kitschy atmosphere. When you walk in there are bears everywhere. You can even buy t-shirts keychains or stuffed bear along with other cutesy items. The food is really great, like down home cooking. My husband likes the Chicken Fried Steak breakfast. Their biscuits and gravy are phenomenal. They also have the best bacon, it is really thick cut and they cook it perfectly. No fatty chewy bacon here. The portions are super generous we always leave with a box, but they have a few items that are offered to be smaller portions of some of their popular items at a lower price. The prices are very reasonable. The service has been great every time we've come to the Black Bear Diner. The only thing that would make it better would be if they sold cherry pie. The sell many other pies but not cherry. Awesome place for the family."}
{"text":"We love black bear diner, the food is great and the service was awesome and the place is clean and the food portions are huge and love it! But gets busy busy but worth it , we big fans of black bear!"}
{"text":"Black bear diner is one of her favorite restaurant to eat and never fails it's the best and it doesn't matter which black bear we been to so many in Nevada and Arizona and Utah and sooooo good! And breakfast and lunch , dinner is all Big portions of food and make sure u come hungry so we'll be back again when we in Vegas !"}
{"text":"The day after thanksgiving day and finally got our fix at black bear diner and it was good and wish they had stuffing doe and the food was great! And I had the pumpkin pie and hubby had the bread pudding and they were good too we a fan of black bear diner and never fails us on breakfast and lunch, dinner so we don't mind coming back when we can or when we in town."}
{"text":"Delicious is the word!  And huge portions!!!! The food was delicious and hot! Try the biscuits and gravy!! They are warm soft and huge!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know what everyone is talking about because this place is not worth the trip. I gave it two stars more than it deserves because our servers were really friendly and really helpful. As far as the food goes, the only thing I enjoyed was the salad, which was fresh. We ordered the fried chicken with red skins potatoes (with brown gravy), green beans and bacon, and cream of potato and the chicken fried steak with red skin potatoes (with country gravy) and Caesar salad. The serving was huge and the fried chicken was juicy and crispy but way too salty. The brown gravy was salty as well. It seemed the only thing not salted on the plate was the green beans, which were canned. The chicken fried steak was incredibly bland. The breading and the gravy was so bland that even with some salt, it didn't help. Overall, the place was nice because their service was nice. Other than that, the food was not something I'd come back for."}
{"text":"What a great place to sit and eat where portion sizes are big, prices are reasonable and service was out of this world. I liked being off the strip away from the chaos for a while. Gave me a feeling of home!! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I was in town for Superbowl Sunday and was taken to Black Bear diner by my cousin who lives here in Vegas. The food was excellent and the service was even better. Our server, Anthony, was very informative and attentive. It's nice to be served by someone who obviously loves his job. The supervisor, Marlene, even came over to our table to welcome us. Our dining experience was so good that we stayed after we paid and eventually wanted a piece of delicious pie. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"So I don't frequent black bear diner at all. However, I was craving a chicken fried steak quite badly... so I decided to hit up my best friend so I can take care of this odd craving. I only say odd because I don't think I've ever craved chicken fried steak lol. 

Apparently, their country fried chicken thing wasn't actually chicken... it was beef! I honestly wanted to walk out right there & then lol. But we stayed & I ordered the fried chicken instead. But thennnn, I was reading reviews & people said they hated the fried chicken & it wasn't good. So I called our server over and decided to switch my order to the country fried chicken. The meal came with salad & cornbread. I loveeee cornbread & theirs was okay, not bad. The country fried steak thing was actually huge & I ordered the \"smaller\" one. The breading was too much tho & it's safe to say that I probably won't be craving it again. Lol 

If I could give this place 5 stars, it's because of Michael (I think that was his name)! He was so nice & on top of his game. However, the food just wasn't great."}
{"text":"Brought my wife's parents here visiting from out of town. Love the Chicken Fried Steak. We ate here during dinner time and the service was very fast! The service was excellent and attentive.

We got individual pies to go after our meal and it was excellent!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. I would really score this place 3.5, but I don't know.

This place looks country and has a very \"homey\" feel. It was cute- I felt like I was home.  My friends and I ordered breakfast, but they do have lunch and dinner. 

We had eggs, bacon, pancakes, potatoes, and coffee. The food came out faster than expected, and was hot. More importantly, it looked like everything was fresh and homemade ( the eggs looked like real eggs, and the hash browns looked like they cut their own potatoes). It was good, but it tastes like something I could make at home. The \"sweet cream\" pancakes were too cakey for our liking, but the flavor was there.  The hash browns had good flavor, but they needed a tad bit more cooking. The bacon tasted great. 

They do have a wide selection of pies ( i LOVE pies). I didn't try any, but it all looked so delicious. 

I would come back to try more things on the menu in order to have a better idea on how I really feel about this place."}
{"text":"Our experience at the Black Bear Diner in Chandler started out rocky but ended up pretty good.  We were seated immediately but then sat without anyone else acknowledging us until we stopped a server.  That server was Ryan, who ended up caring for our table and did a FABULOUS job!  He was attentive and accurate. The decor is nice and the restaurant is clean and comfortable.  The food was good - I wouldn't say great, but it was good.  I imagine we'll be back."}
{"text":"It is country charm meets city location! This is like moms kitchen with a server! I had a tri tip sand which and my wife had the chicken parmigiana and we both were stuffed to the gils! Then who can leave with out cobbler needless to say I won't eat for a week I am so stuffed! The service is great it's clean and affordable!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for breakfast this morning. Service was fine, and the host seemed warm and trying to do his best to accommodate the large crowd of people waiting for tables. The food was Ok...nothing horribly wrong with it, and large portions, but not spectacular. My husband and son ordered over medium eggs and they were runny. If the chef can cook eggs over medium properly that's a good sign, and it wasn't happening this morning. Biscuits were huge but heavy and had a bisquick flavor. The sweet cream pancakes were very, very sweet...this probably appeals to a lot of people but it isn't our thing. I was expecting it to be better. We didn't try any of the desserts. Maybe those are exceptional and that's why so many love black bear diner."}
{"text":"With news that this diner had opened it's doors this week, my friends and I met up for breakfast this morning. I arrived at 10a and was the first of five to arrive, so I checked in with the greeter and was taken to a booth within 10 min. As my party was arriving, we were asked for our drink order and they came out quickly. The menu is printed on a newspaper format  and it was pretty neat that the news articles were re-prints from previous decades of our small town. The menu had a wide selection of options for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The whole menu was available all day and I was told that we could mix our side items btwn breakfast, lunch and dinner. Our waiter, Jordan, was very attentive and kept our coffees filled. I heard that this place was known for their Chicken Fried Steak so that's what I ordered along with 2 eggs and the country potatoes. It came out in a generous portion and although I intended to eat only half, I ended up eating pretty much the whole plate. The biscuit that came with the plate was huge but I didn't care much for it. Maybe if it came with gravy? I tried a bite of my friend's Huevos Rancheros and it was bursting with flavor. All in all, we were impressed by the service & the food."}
{"text":"What incredible service here! Shanna and Nicole are so welcoming! I guess I just missed the dinner rush because a slew of people were leaving with to go boxes. I was seated right away and enjoyed the bear country diner atmosphere. Shanna was on point with the specials and was kind enough to let me know what was no longer available for the evening. I ordered the 5 ounce chicken fried steak dinner with mash potato, country gravy, and corn on the cob for the side. You have the option for a 10 ounce country fried steak, but I figured the 5 ounce with the sides should be plenty. Speaking of plenty, I also ordered The Big Bear burger with parmesan chips for to-go. All the food I tried was really good and not greasy or too salty as far as diner food goes. I also had the banana cream pie to go. Very good portion as well. Pie has nice chunks of bananas in it, but I think they used artificial banana flavoring to enhance the pie and it would probably do just fine without it. Probably would try a different pie next time though. Perhaps the coconut cream pie...overall, I would recommend this place. Really good service, good comfort food, and country cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great breakfast joint! Generous servings. You can't go wrong with either the waffles or pancakes. I've been to one of there Oregon locations numerous times and this Chandler location once. Honestly though, I've only had they're breakfast. My daughter loves the 'cabin' and black bear decor."}
{"text":"I hate to give a place a 1 star review, and maybe it was an anomaly the morning we tried to go to Black Bear Diner.  

We came in on a Saturday late morning wanting to try a new breakfast/brunch place.  The decor is very cozy and we were seated right away.  The gentleman seating us said in passing that they had just had a huge rush and that they WERE an hour behind.  But he assured us that the rush was over.

At the beginning our server was very friendly with good communication.  We decided on our meals quickly and this is where it all went south.  Yes it was a busy morning, but 45 minutes later were were all getting anxious for our food.  Two adults and 2 kids (10 and 8)  Our server had not been back to check on us, refill our coffee/drinks, or update us on our food.  By 1hr15 minutes (another 30 MINUTES after we had seen our waiter) my husband found our server by the kitchen and asked about our order.  We were the 3rd ticket in and it hadn't been started.  So disappointing. If were would have been told how far behind the kitchen was, we wouldn't have stayed. So we paid for our drinks and left.  

Next door the Costco hotdogs tasted AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Not what we expected. Tri tip was room temperature, DRY shoe leather.  How a cook could let that plate leave the kitchen is a mystery to me.  And the inexperienced server delivered the awful meal.  The pot roast was served only warm, not hot.  The total kitchen operation will become the nemesis of this new store in the chain.  The other meals were only mediocre.  We politely made the manager aware of the issues who responded professionally.  Not sure if I want to try this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Wow, that's a lot of food. Great value, everything was perfect. Jessy, our server, was very helpful and polite."}
{"text":"Was looking so forward to having a good breakfast before work, did not happen. When you ask for extra crispy bacon and you have to send it back 4 times and they still didn't get it right. Eggs were cooked fine. Never ever had this much issue at this site or the Mesa site what so ever ... cook needs to learn what extra crispy is and not serve cold toast. I will tell you our waitress was fantastic Aloma."}
{"text":"They were very busy. They even had a party of over 50 ahead of us. We only had to wait 20 min. nd our order was taken promptly. My husband ordered his favorite linguica dish. I had chicken and pesto pasta. The food tasted amazing and the portions were good sized. We went to the south Las Vegas outlet center location. The service was awesome!"}
{"text":"Exactly what you want from a country diner breakfast.  

My family and I went to Black Bear Diner off the strip for breakfast the second day of our vacation and it was great.  Southern country ambiance inside, the servers were friendly and the menu immense!
Our party of six ordered a wide variety of items from Cinnamon roll french toast (which was sinfully awesome), to breakfast burritos.  I ordered the country scramble which was biscuits, eggs, sausage, and gravy with potatoes on the side.  Everybody seemed very happy with their selections.

The only thing preventing this review from being 5 stars for me was that I was not a fan of the sausage that came with my breakfast.  It was a large, thick patty that just didn't have the flavor or sear I like in a sausage patty.

Other than that, good stuff!"}
{"text":"Perfect back-home comfort food at its best!

This place was a regular eatery for my parents and I back in 2007 but we stopped going for a while.  That while became a happy return for my fiancée and I recently where the food is still top notch!  Portions can often be big so it's best to ask the servers just how big the size of the plate of food is.  Biscuits and gravy are not just served on a small saucer, they're served on an elipse sized platter covered in gravy!  You WILL need to share some of these platters between two people!

Recently I had one of the most delicious sandwiches EVER!  The Gobbler, not to be confused by the Gobbler served at Farm Basket, is sliced roast turkey, avocado, mayo, tomato, and cranberry sauce on toast.  Oh my God! Was that a tasty sandwich!  I think it was almost as good as the Bobbie from Capriotti's!  It's really like having Thanksgiving on a sandwich!

Really attentive servers that always come around to bring you fresh beverages and they are quite knowledgeable with what comes with each platter so you don't get the whole \"I'll have to check the kitchen for you...\" or \"I'm not sure...I can ask for you...\"

I'm looking forward to going back more and more to Black Bear Diner as it's definitely the place to go for comfort food favorites!

The only thing I wish, is that they were open 24/7.  The diner reminds me a lot of a diner my family and I used to frequent back east in Wilmington, Delaware called The Golden Castle.  The restaurant really seems perfect for 24/7 business!"}
{"text":"I liked this place and was excited 
But the menu is very fattening 
It's a diner but doesn't have grits or good soups, but staff is nice and located in a good area. 
Visited about 4 times 
The menu just wasn't my thing 
But I'm being honest my family loved it. 

I'm just picky I guess"}
{"text":"We stopped for breakfast on our road trip and barely beat the rush!

The food was delicious and well priced for the portions you get. I personally ordered the GRIZZ Breakfast and was stuffed by the time I took my last bite of the pancakes it came with (along with eggs to order, bacon, sausage, ham, and choice of hash browns or country potatoes). The rest of the family was not disappointed with their selections either.

Our waitress, Ana, was very friendly and did well at keeping our coffees filled despite the business of the restaurant. Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"We always come and eat at the Black Bear Diner when we are in Las Vegas . Just wish they would build some of these out east. Never had a meal I didn't like or one that I felt I didn't get my monies worth. The desserts are wonderful and you must take them home with you."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Black Bear today. I have dine here many times in the past never had any problems. Today it took over 50 minutes to get are order. We were a party of two, the party of 6 that sat after us received there meal 20 minutes before us. We didn't get an explanation on to why it took so long. The manager gave us a free pie and an apology. I give this place 3 stars simple for the poor service this one time. I will return, food is great and fresh"}
{"text":"This black bear diner was good.  Had a bear claw and smoked sausage."}
{"text":"Just got a fried chicken dinner a takeout.  Three pieces.  The chicken was dry and tasted like it had been sitting around for some time.  Seemed it had been reheated or left on low heat for too long.  Great disappointment."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this NEW Black Bear Diner. I had visited numerous other locations in California and Oregon and all of my memories have been so good. Tonight changes that all unfortunately. 

The menu had plenty of items that were not in stock and we could not order. Then the food took so long to come out of the kitchen I was ready to pay for my iced tea \"which the waitress said they do not hand out straws for\" and eat somewhere else. There were 5 of us and the meals came from the kitchen two at a time with 5 minutes in between and my veggie burger came when everyone was half way done eating. Plus my veggie burger was not like the menu said... No chillies or pepper jack cheese.

So in a city like Las Vegas with so many choices this Black Bear will have to improve or close their doors."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Great food, pancakes are to die for! Love the atmosphere. Will be going back!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Do not go here!! Service was horrible. Food was okay. The line just to pay the bill was horrendous. We will not be back. Took us over 45 mins to get our food. When we would ask for a refill and the server would forget he would just say \"my bad\"."}
{"text":"The stars are for customer service!
All of the servers are super nice. Manager is absolutely about great customer service!
Well, we have a Love-Hate relationship in this place.
Location is convenient. Easy drive on the way home after work. Plenty of parking spot! 
We are only eating breakfast here, so I don't know how their other food items. (We ate dinner once in Reno! It was horrible!) Anyway, we had really bad and really good experiences in this location at breakfast time! It depends who is the cook, food can be very good or very mediocre!
I would never eat their Steak and eggs! Somehow they can not make it right. Eventually they are taking it off from the bill, trying to makeup for the mistake. My point is that I don't want free food! I would like to eat a good meal after working 12 hours in my job! We told them that, so we were getting somewhat better food lately. I found the Classic Eggs Benedict very tasty. I like it with country potatoes. Their hash browns are not cooked well enough!
My friend always orders different things with more or less luck!
I think their fresh orange juice is over priced, still order it since I don't drink soda!"}
{"text":"This place is on it as far as pancakes go. They are so flippen yummy its crazy!! The coffee is nice and strong & the servers are wicked fast. our food was on the table within minutes of her taking the order. A great place to take the kids since they are so fast. And the teddy bear decor is very cute as well."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is HIGHLY recommended if your arriving in Vegas in the early AM or leaving on a Sunday morning. We got greeted as soon as we stepped through the door & got seated right when we walked in. I've gotta tell ya - this group of people were the nicest i've ever been served by. Hands down!

The food was amazing! The serving sizes were HUGE! Our nice server did forewarn us lol but we enjoyed every single second we were in there. Seriously. I couldn't have asked for a better breakfast joint to stop by before leaving Vegas - our weekend was amazing!

I got the cinnamon roll french toast that came w a side of fresh fruit, softened butter, maple syrup, & I ordered a side of sausage - 10/10. No words. One of the best i've had!

Husband got the Denver omelette w home fries & a pancake - he devoured it (except the home fries - I devoured that for him ;)"}
{"text":"We were a party of 8 with 4 kids under 15 years of age looking for a decent family restaurant.  We found the menu selection plentiful and the prices quite reasonable.  Service was good-not exceptional.  One member of our party cannot eat onions or garlic.  He requested his steak without onions, but he meal not only came with onions, so did his salad.  The waiter took it back and likely just had all the onions removed instead of having it remade.   Portions were large and everything tasted good.  I heard the corn muffins were good--I didn't get a chance to try it.  I would recommend this restaurant for families for the decent quality and value."}
{"text":"As a french on holyday in Vegas, i had to try a good diner.

And the least i can say is : HOLY SHIT
Thas was SO good ! And so big ! We came here for breakfast, and i must say we couldn't eat anything more during the rest of the day.

i Had a Chicken fried steak with cream gravy and a lava chocolate cake... i could barely stand up after that.

And now i'm thousands of kilometers from this place, and that really sucks !!!

Black bear Diner, I will never forget you"}
{"text":"This place is ok. It's not great, really, I could name a handful of other great places to go before coming here. The service was decent, the food was mediocre at best and the prices were a bit high for what you got. $8 for one pancake? I thought it was a mistake or that it came with eggs, bacon and hash browns. Nope just the pancake. I wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"Chicken Fried Steak and eggs \"Oh Me Oh My\".  Enough said!

When in Vegas and you want to eat off the strip its worth the trip out of the same old Casino buffet for breakfast.

{"text":"Black bear diner was not at their best the last time we went. We arrived at 7:45 PM and after 6 minutes we were finally greated to put our name in. The hostess was not able to provide a wait time but looking through the window and seeing 11 open tables and no less than 5 servers on the floor we are like no problem. 20 minutes later we have not been seated and 3-5 tables were waiting at the counter to checked out (took over 15 minutes for all table to check out with one waiting over 5 minutes for someone to come to the register so they could pay). After the hostess checked out some of the customers and handling money and change she proceeded to go set the tables and handle the silverware without washing/cleaning her hands......needless to say we asked for different silverware! Then the lady went into clean the restrooms and brought the trashed out and placed them behind the counter and then went to seat the waiting table handing them menus without wearing gloves or washing her hands.

The food is great! Large portions and a great menu. I would prefer coke over Pepsi but personal preference. The food is always hot and very flavorful!"}
{"text":"Great service and excellent food. Our server was Jaimie (sp) and she was at our table quickly, took our drink order and gave us time to decide on our dinner. Never rushed. 
I had the chicken fried breast with red potatoes and vegetables (and gravy over the top, can't forget the gravy) and knew from the first bite that nothing would be going home in a box. It was delicious."}
{"text":"My family and I really liked this place. Nice decor. VERY friendly hostess and server. Excellent menu. Good food that was cooked properly, served promptly and tasted great. The only personal hang-up was that they up use a soybean oil blend for frying. Also, their men's room could have used some tidying up. Nut neither of those detract from the positives enough to bring it down to four stars. 
Great family atmosphere."}
{"text":"First timers and well worth it. They have breakfast, Lunch, Dinner day or night. We wanted breakfast but decided on dinner. Amazing Tri-Tip Platter and Ribeye Steak plates. Comes with soup or salad and I had to try their Tortilla Chicken Soup. Very yummy. 
Their Mash Potatoes OH MY WORLD. So creamy and yummy.  But I must say when you first walk in they tell you their plates are huge unless you get the little bites. True to their word and yes it's like going back to your grandmother home cooking. A must try if you haven't. Recommendations.... hard to say as it all looks good enough to eat"}
{"text":"Our waitress Brandy would be the biggest reason we would come back to this place! She was an awesome server and even more fun to joke around with. Thank you for being a great server Brandy!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here in a few years and thought it would be a good place to bring the kids for brunch. The hostess told us approximately 25 min wait and she crossed off our name by accident after I inquired 22 minutes and haven't heard her call and people behind us already sat down. So I'm kinda annoyed at this point and hope the rest of the experience would be good to make up for it. We get sat and did get drinks fairly quickly. We ordered 2 kids meals (burger, chicken fingers, fries) and 2 Eggs Benedict (Huevos Rancheros, California Bacon Avocado). The food took a long time (35 minutes). The waitress was not very attentive. She did not check on us or let us know food was almost done. After food came out she did not ask if we needed anything like tobasco or anything. The food was fairly good. The poached eggs were cooked correctly. It was nice it came with a little bowl of fresh fruit and choice of hash browns or homestyle. The waitress did not check if the food was okay. When we were done she asked if we wanted anything else. I saw on the menu earlier the kids meals came with a sundae. So I had to remind her about it. She was like oh yeah it does. I think if I didn't know she would have pretended not to know so she wouldn't have to bring it. The fresh squeezed OJ was cheap quality and tasted like it was diluted and sugar was added. They charge $5 per glass. Skip it. Sad to say but I will not be returning to this diner as the food and decor/atmosphere was not bad. But ultimately it comes down to service and ours was not up to par."}
{"text":"Ordered the best choice w/ biscuits and gravy... Food was beyond good...came because of the good reviews, did not leave dissappointed.... will come back... Portions are huge... we also ordered the club sandwich, which came with a large side of fries..."}
{"text":"Wow, I work really close by this place and had always blown it off to eat lunch at other places nearby. Needless to say I am mad at myself for never trying it. It was great, cheesy \"country\" décor, great service and great prices. Thanks to Christina for her service, she was very pleasant. Other employees were great as well. I needed something extra and they stopped to get it for me even though it was \"not there area\". They just did it.

The food was really good. I had the The Blazin' Bear sandwich. It was a tri-tip sandwich with BBQ sauce and lettuce tomato and mayo. Simple yet perfect for lunch. I will be getting up early tomorrow to stop there to have breakfast! 

It was also nice that they have a no smoking sign when you walk in and it's actually enforced."}
{"text":"This is the place to eat a hearty breakfast before plowing the back 40. There are two reasons for this.

First, the portions are sized so that if you happen to be a black bear who wants to tank up before hibernating for the winter, you can do it for about $10 and be confident that you'll still have a bit of belly fat when you awaken in March. A short stack of pancakes was equivalent to a full order just about anywhere else. So you'll want some serious manual labor to work off the calories.

Second, the locals love this place. At 10 a.m. on Saturday in the rain, the line was out the door. if you want to recreate the hectic feel of a New York City lunch counter amidst the Big Woods, that's fine, and the waitstaff were doing a heroic job of coping. If you hope for a more relaxed breakfast, the crack of dawn before hitching up the oxen to the plow may be your best bet.

To the restaurant's credit, the blueberry pancakes use actual fresh blueberries, not canned ones or blueberry pie filling. The pancakes otherwise didn't distinguish themselves one way or the other -- they're fine, very much on the sweet side. I'd do Black Bear again over the IHOP across the street because the overall experience is more entertaining, but next time, I'd try the biscuit. The muscular dudes next to me at the counter had biscuits, and they seemed to be larger than our heads."}
{"text":"Great food. Lots of it too. Lots of homemade items. Biscuits were homemade and the place fills up quick for breakfast so come early. Pancakes were awesome. Really didn't need any syrup they were so sweet."}
{"text":"I was in there the other day about a week ago immediately greeted with a big smile set down very friendly happy server looked at the menu ordered some delicious food wow what big servings couldn't believe the size it was delicious and I save the menu which was a newspaper cute menu I will definitely be back awesome awesome awesome I love the food there can hardly wait till I go back again the ribs where delicious!"}
{"text":"My family and I went on a mini vacation to Vegas and thought that we would try a less known place for breakfast instead of Dennys or IHOP. Found this nice place on Yelp and I have to say that we were not disappointed! The breakfast was awesome. My plate was really big and all for a great price. The restaurant is also really cute because they have teddy bears everywhere and everything bears. I recommend this place if you're one of those that doesn't like eating at the typical chains. It was worth it!"}
{"text":"Very busy establishment, but rightfully so, food is delicious, portions are great, very affordable, and everything is made at the moment."}
{"text":"What a cute little chain! Their placemats tell the story of the restaurant and the menus were 1962 newspaper stories! The service was fantastic - water always full, attentive, friendly...

They serve the full menu all day long (breakfast, lunch, or dinner!), so we got their breakfast special and a sandwich. The special was a handmade biscuit topped with chicken strips, scrambled egg, and gravy. Really tasty. The plate was giant (including the country potatoes). 

Our sandwich was called The Gobbler - white bread, roasted turkey, avocado, cranberries, tomato. I've had turkey and cranberry sandwiches before, but the avocado and tomato added another dimension. It was delicious! I also couldn't decide between fries or onion rings, so our server brought both! They have a great seasoning to their fries and a nice crispy coating to their onion rings.

They've got a handful of desserts that they'll pack up for you to take home. I definitely want to go back and try the blackberry cobbler :)"}
{"text":"It was packed but we were seated in less than 5 minutes! Don was AMAZING! He was so personable and really made us feel like it was our regular daily hangout spot! He entertained us with great and hilarious conversation! The food came so QUICK and you know how quickly you need that food on a Saturday mornin! The portions were huge, food delicious and prices were great! Our server was amazing too! She was so kind and welcoming. I'm sorry I forget your name, her name tag said Supervisor. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch and had their Patty Melt and homemade chips. Chips were awesome & loved the atmosphere and the waitress was great! Will be back for their breakfast, before heading back to Ohio. I wish we had a Black Bear Diner on the eastern coast!"}
{"text":"First of all, great customer service! Went to eat lunch with my family and the server was very friendly. It was nice that she was always checking on us if we needed anything. I got the California burger with homemade kettle chips and it was awesome. I believe kids get a free scoop of ice cream with a choice of topping if they order a certain item from the menu. Other than that the staff was very friendly with us. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"Whoa mama!  This place gets 5 stars for how fast you get the food and their big portions.  We went on a Sunday morning and had breakfast.  The wait was 30 minutes but once we were seated and placed our order we had our food in under 5 minutes.  The staff here really knows how to get orders out.  The food is great quality too.  They have a nice sized menu and their prices are decent.  Can't wait to try their dinners."}
{"text":"The food was very delicious. It came in a timely manner and was served exatbow we ordered it. The waitress was Yolanda and she was so friendly,fast and efficient. She was polite and very well mannered. I loved her southern accent as well. The restaurant was clean and inviting. They had a soft country feel to it."}
{"text":"So we were gonna go to Ih*p at first but someone from local recommended us to check this place out. And I am so glad we stopped by here for lunch because everything we had here was great! 

After looking at many pictures from Yelp, I decided to get taco salad and I gotta say, that taco salad was the best taco ish food I've ever had. I mean I had lots of taco bowl, salad, etc but damn, this salad was so amazing. It was huge too! Like it was full of fresh salad, chicken, bean, and some avocado on side. I got there with my empty stomach but I was in a food comma by the time we left there.  

Waiting wasn't too terrible and staff was nice too. Also, I think price here was pretty reasonable too compared to other fancy brunch places on the strip. I highly recommend Black bear if you are looking for a decent breakfast/brunch and dinner place!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch!!!  Clam chowder, big sandwiches, great service. We will be back when we visit again!"}
{"text":"Forget all of the tourist trap breakfast buffets at the casinos! Black Bear Diner is the absolute, hands down, A-One, number one, without a single doubt, 100% best spot for breakfast in town. We come here every day every time we're in Vegas. It's situated a short drive off the main tourist areas in what could be briefly described as 'back in the real world' meaning where the good, hard working people of Las Vegas actually live."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was lacking but I did notice that it was only my waitress.
When I asked the different waitresses for refills or things like the rest of my food, she quickly and courteous obliged.
I'll give it a second try, I'll just make sure to get a different waitress
Oh and the pie in the window was stale, when i returned it the manager checked the date to see how long they were where and it was almost 2 weeks...so stay away from the pie in the window.....lol

Stale pie and bad service and I still give it 2 stars....the food must be pretty decent right. Look at my other reviews, I'm picky"}
{"text":"First time here.

Decor was really charming. 

The reason I am writing this is because of the service. I have been a Food Server for 6 years on the Las Vegas Strip. My server here Beatriz was absolutely amazing! I mean she blew me away. Her knowledge of the menu, her friendliness, was incredible. I can arguably say she was the best server I have ever had. EVER. 

Food was delicious and really good but I've had better breakfast. That's the only reason I did t give it 5 stars.

I will be returning to personally request Beatriz."}
{"text":"This used to be another chain a few years ago, I hadn't noticed it had changed until I visited a Black Bear in Tulare Ca. a little while ago.  I happened to be cruising by and saw the sign, called the wife and went in for some take out.  I got the tri-tip, chicken fried steak, and pot roast dinners with green beans, mashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes, salad and soup.  Everything was good except the pot roast.  Some may like it, but I make much better at home, so I was biased.  The tri-tip was the real star!  Perfectly cooked (med rare), very well seasoned, tender, awesome!  The food does have a home made taste that is really great.  I'm looking forward to trying the breakfast! You get plenty for your money so it's a great value.  Both times I've been there the staff were friendly and helpful!  I will be back."}
{"text":"Although this place is always packed, it's completely worth it. The service usually isn't very good but the food makes up for it. This last time we were here my nephew was being fussy (two years old) and the waitress was so kind to him. She was able to calm him down and have small short conversations with him. He doesn't usually respond well to strangers but she was so friendly that he melted into her hands. I wish I remembered her name but she was amazing. Again the food is great and the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp,and from the reviews and pictures of fellow yelpers I gave it a shot being there was not one in my hometown.restaurant was clean,we were seated immediately which was nice for it being busy.our waitress I believe here name was Close to cindy,she was great we ordered our food and drinks and got them fairly quick the food was great aswell as the service we then tried there very good looking pies which were great,I would definitely return when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We had a great meal!  The service was good, the food was very good, the interior has been updated.  We ate there a few years ago and it seemed their claim to fame was enormous portions of food that really wasn't healthy, at least for me.  Huge portions coupled with my 1950's upbringing where I was admonished to \"clean my plate\" really made me feel miserable later in the evening.  Today, my side salad was fresh and crisp, my entree (hamburger steak) and mashed potatoes were normal sized proportions and I cleaned my plate guilt free.   We still didn't have room for desert but we took a blackberry pie home with us for later.  I feel better about going there for our next night out."}
{"text":"Had a great time checking out this spot in Las Vegas. We went for breakfast today and everything was very good. Nice size portions.  The servers were very attentive and friendly. The only reason for 4 /5 stars is no turkey substitutes for bacon or sausage. If you don't eat pork you will just have to do without. Also, they didn't really communicate that we pay at the front counter for our meal. The waiter brought our bill but never returned to take our payment. So we eventually figured this out."}
{"text":"Came to black bear 15 minutes wait get in. Our section about ten empty tables. Still waiting for food another 20min later"}
{"text":"Service is great. Food is Excellent. A New Fave for Breakfast. It's a very nice quiet and comfortable place to go for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner."}
{"text":"Our favorite breakfast place! Ask for Summer she is literally the best!! Foods great, environment is awesome. Portions are great and it's inexpensive. Super accessible right off the 10."}
{"text":"Excellent, friendly staff from front to back especially the hostess Nessa. Beautiful smile that melts your heart"}
{"text":"I heard the rumor of a giant Black Bear Burger and the huge portions, so during our trip to Las Vegas, we decided to see what the heck it was all about. To my surprise, this is what I ordered:

Black Bear Burger
8 inch daimeter  sesame bun
7 inch diameter beef patty & 0.8 in thick  (medium rare recommended)
Fries, approximately half a pound, similar to 2.5 servings of In N Out Fries
1 Glass of water

The burger was ginormous, thick, juicy and prepared just the way I envisioned. They do not lie with their portions and motto of serving \"Heary portions for reasonable prices\" (or something like that).  The ambiance was pretty much a \"cabin\" type environment, with stuffed, wooden and toy bears all over the place. It felt warm, and the staff provided excellent service. It was like going to a Denny's in the middle of the forest without the creepiness. For my portion, it was just about $10.

Hope this review helps...I hope your experience was as good as mine!"}
{"text":"Ordered Huevos Rancheros because they looked great on the menu, the tortilla was barely crispy, over cooked eggs, raw potatoes"}
{"text":"Great to have Black Bear Diner here!  New Jersey Diner sized portions, very good waitstaff and high quality food and the people who make it, they even have a counter at this location!  I just wish they were open 24 hours to fill a void in this end of town."}
{"text":"Black Bear is a REAL diner, even though a large chain there is a hometown feel...not like Cracker Barrel. Our waitress, Candy from New Jersey, the diner capital of the world, was fantastic!"}
{"text":"The food and the service are amazing. I had the eggs Benedict and had a few Special requests. They were fast and friendly and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Love this Restaurant. A little bit out of my way but well worth the drive. Seeing that the one closer to my home on Dysart and I -10 where the staff isn't as clean! as they are here in Laveen."}
{"text":"First of all I was not excited about going here for dinner. Never been there, never wanted to go and probably been passed it a million times back in the day. The fam saw a commercial (great advertising) recently and fricken loved the bear mascot. So much that my man thinks he could be the voice! \"Well Howdy! \"The place was packed! Short wait was no prob since we had a photo shoot with gigantic stuffed animal bear on the bench. Server Mikaela was super sweet. Had great recommendations when I asked her. Our table had chicken tenders w fries + bacon ranch!  Blazing Bear sandwich. ( Reminded us of french dip on steroids so asked for side of au jus. Yum!) I did Chicken Pot Pie w mashed pots+ turkey gravy. Pie tasted great some herbs and nice crust. Bits of turkey in the gravy were also a nice touch. We wanted to split a chocolate pie for dessert. They were out.Boo! Happy w Strawberry one. Also bought a Baby Burn Sauce. Tried all sauces before picking Baby sauce. Comfort food with bear theme everywhere! Great for kiddos. Only negative for me is the restaurant is in desperate need of new flooring."}
{"text":"This diner is amazing. The portion are huge and the prices are not bad. Everyone is so friendly and the cobbler is great. And it's kid friendly"}
{"text":"So Very good.  Discovered it by accident and AM a huge fan.  Clearly my posting of 11/11 was a typo.  Best new find in a long time."}
{"text":"Great service my coffee never went below 1/2 way before it was refilled. We had breakfast pancake were a little dry however with a extra cup of syrup very good. Enjoy our food"}
{"text":"Good value! Big portions. Comfortable. My inlaws recommended this place and it was worth the visit."}
{"text":"Chicken fried steak! Thats all Im going to say.. They give you huge portions for the price. The only thing I felt uncomfortable about is the tightness of the place. Its always packed and there is barely any room to walk. This can easily be solved by calling in the order and just picking it up. Bottom line, food is great but place is a bit tight."}
{"text":"Went back tonight JUST for dessert   and we got excellent food and service again,  this time from Taryn and Bobb !! This restaurant really knows how to hire the nicest people ! Of course we will be back time and again to this great diner, one of our favorite places !!"}
{"text":"No wait on a Saturday night.  This is always a last chance, last resort kind of place.  The food is only ever Meh at best.  Over the last couple of trips in there we have had ravioli, chicken fried steak, ribs, and a burger.  The burgers are consistently good there. Everything else is fairly lack luster.  Not bad.  Just frozen/canned.  It is close in our neighborhood and when we cant figure out anything else we go in.  I wouldn't recommend it to friends from our of town."}
{"text":"Our server was nice and attentive. The place was practically empty so we were seated promptly and enjoyed the quietness. Food tasted good. Although their huevos rancheros were not traditional. They came on corn tostadas instead of soft corn tortillas. Weird but ok. Kids get a free ice cream scoop after 11am so that had our kids excited.

Also their ranch has bacon bits so if you are vegetarian or don't  eat pork - you'll want to have different dressing or ask if they have an alternative"}
{"text":"This place has become a fairly regular spot for my little family.    Its one place we all seem to agree on.  While most of the food isn't spectacular or anything, everything is usually pretty good and there are some real gems in there and you get a good value for your money.  What stands out to us is the customer service is always excellent.  The servers are very friendly and professional, the place is usually very clean, and the service is fast for a diner.   They are great with our 3 year old, who loves the Chocolate Chip Pancakes!    I recommend the Chicken Fried Steak and almost always have a bowl of Chicken Noodle Soup.    The best part however, is the Cherry Creme Pie!    Save room or take one home."}
{"text":"I prefer the original location on Jones & Tropicana but this place is still good. Get ready to wait because it's usually really packed. I love the food here! Home style cooking and great portions."}
{"text":"Today we decided to go to our favorite diner. Nothing I hate more than going to a restaurant and not being greeted by the person running the front. Chrissy acted like we were a huge bother. No smile. Nothing. We found a new diner closer to home. Think we will try that one instead. I worked in the service industry before and service with a smile is huge. Acting like the public is annoying doesn't help with your hostess career, Chrissy. Learn to be grateful that people even come to your job to eat to keep your place open."}
{"text":"Was one of my favorite places for breakfast.  However, my last two visits have been very disappointing.  The first time my breakfast took  a long time to receive and when it got there bacon was almost uncooked, hash browns were burnt, and eggs were dried up.  When I complained they said they had a new cook.  Next time I went (about 10 days later) a worse outcome.  Took 30 minutes to get (on a Friday at about 10:45) and the bacon arrived raw, eggs dry and cut up into tiny pieces, hash browns cold and toast burnt.  I told the server it was unacceptable and she offered to take it back.  I told her forget it and I left.  I don't know what happened but I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I went to this establishment with a classmate who claimed it was great.  We met for lunch and were seated immediately.  After being seated, it went downhill from there.  There were no place settings on the table when we sat down and none were offered.  My friend had to ask for place settings, menus for the two of us and cold drinks.  After that the waitress disappeared.  My friend then waved down a man to ask that someone take our order.  After our order was finally brought to us, no one, absolutely no one came around to ask if we were alright.  I knew then I would never return to this place, nor would I bring friends or family here.   My burger was good, but did not compensate for the lack of service we received.  Lastly, my friend asked to speak to the Manager and the woman she asked stated she was the manager.  She told her of our experience and she casually apologized and offered us both a dessert due to the bad service we encountered.  I declined the dessert and my friend asked that I please accept it.  I did to please her and when I arrived home, I threw it in the trash bin.

Sorry BBD, there are far too many GREAT restaurants in Las Vegas that have awesome food and incredible service to accept  or settle for your horrible service!

You lost a local and all of her friends and family; some of who live here in the valley and those that visit frequently.

{"text":"Wow. So disappointed right now with this place. 

Since my original review, I've been going on a regular basis, pretty much weekly, and ordering the \"Bear's Choice\" with biscuits & gravy and the sausage links. It's become my staple, and up until tonight, I'd been pretty satisfied with it, and with this restaurant. 

What happened? Well, for starters, there are three components to the plate -eggs, biscuits & gravy and sausage. I got biscuits that were either stale or overcooked, so that the outside was hard as a rock, with only some usable inside. Biscuits and gravy should not require a knife to be eaten, and certainly not need to be sawed apart! Secondly, and more importantly, the sausage links appeared unevenly cooked/heated, and upon touching them (and even tasting a bite) I confirmed they were in fact cold inside. Not big deal, right? Send it back right?

So I tell our server, Shelby, that hard biscuits and cold sausage is 2 out of 3 and that's no good. She apologizes and takes it back, and so begins our inordinate wait for the remade food. Eventually, after what seemed like way too long (as in at least 10 minutes), it finally comes back out. Shelby brings it, no sign of a manager this whole time, which I was put off by, and I take a look at the new plate. The biscuits are fine, but the sausage links are clearly burned to a crisp. I mean charred black, flaking off burned casing into a pile of ash on the plate. It actually stinks like burned food, especially once I use a fork to probe it and even more of it flakes off and disintegrates. Disgusting, absolutely disgusting. What's worse, I have the sneaking suspicion that it was deliberate, because someone in the kitchen got butt-hurt that I sent food back and said it was cold. 

I flag the server down and show her. She apologizes profusely on taking a serious look at the sausage and realizing how horrifically it is burned. I'm sure she can smell it at this point too. When I tell her I suspect it was deliberate, and out of spite for sending it back as cold, she doesn't even disagree with me at all. She takes it back and says she'll remove it from the bill and notify a manager. The same manager we've seen neither hair nor hide of the entire time.

A short while later, she brings the bill. Says the manager is on the way. Waited a couple minutes, but figured \"heck with it\" and went up front to pay and leave. No manager up there either (surprise!) so we paid and were on our way. 

I called to talk with the manager as soon as I got home. She informs me that the server, Shelby, must be a liar, because the manager was not notified either time our food went back and she was never coming to our table (good thing I didn't wait!). Furthermore, when I press for the name of the person that spitefully and deliberately ruined my food, she confers with her kitchen staff and then returns to tell me, \"Nobody fessed up to it, but Joe is in charge back there,\" and furthermore, states that according to him it was cooked that way because I sent it back as cold. Yes, you read that right, she all but confirms my hypothesis that it was some deliberate, spiteful act by the kitchen staff. Unreal. 

So there you have it. A manager out of touch with what is happening in the restaurant, a server (Shelby) that lies to customers and hides issues from her manager, and a kitchen staff run by someone (Joe) that thinks it's perfectly okay to spitefully burn someone's food when they have the apparent gall to send it back for being cold to the touch. 

I'm planning to reach out to the head office first thing tomorrow morning to pass along my feedback, since I doubt very much that management at this restaurant is going to do anything about it. I'm also going to get in touch with the franchise owner for this location and speak to him personally regarding our experience. I have no tolerance for people that deliberately ruin my meal to teach me a lesson about sending their food back.

In a nutshell, stay away from this place or at the very least, make sure you never send anything back because the head chef (Joe) can't handle criticism without lashing out and burning your food deliberately, all while hiding in the kitchen. Shameful."}
{"text":"Great food. Rich menu, about 10$ for a good big meal that you can even share. I had the hungry grizz you can check the photo"}
{"text":"So I've been hearing how good this place is and decided to try it with my family. The decor is unique, a lot of junk for dust to collect on. A busser greeted us at the door and walked us to a booth. Only problem was that I asked for a table but I guess he didn't hear me. A few moments later our server got our orders and the food came out quick. I decided to order the stuffed cheddar burger. I ordered it well done, I got my burger rare. I ordered well because I know stuffed burgers take a lot longer to cook. I called the server over and told her my burger was still under, she tried to explain to me that's how there burgers come. I cook for a living, we server burgers as well at my work, don't give me that BS. Anyways she really didn't try to fix the situation. My girlfriend didn't want us to make a scene so I left the issue alone. Later while some of us were still eating the server comes up to our table and try to start taking our plates. Sorry we are slow eaters, sorry we were conversing instead of eating. On the bright side there pancakes were really really good. Enough for me to give this place a second try sometime down the road."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in a reasonable distance to my house. This even beats out Crackers & Co. and T.C. Eggington's in my book, which is saying a lot. The portions are massive and you easily get 2 or 3 times the amount of food for your buck as you do at those other 2 chains. This is comfort food at its (almost) finest.

They don't serve anything fancy, but it is all -- and I mean ALL -- delicious. I've been many times and have tried over a dozen of their breakfast entrees and half a dozen lunch/brunch items. To honestly say that I have never had a bad meal here says a lot, and explains why I keep going back. The food has a down home taste to it that I have yet to see replicated anywhere but my mom's kitchen table. No joke, this stuff tastes like grandma made it. The only downside is that some side dishes or sauces/gravies (not the focus, but still) taste pre-made or from frozen products. All of the entrees and massive biscuits are fresh, but still. :/ I know that this is a franchise in a West Coast chain, but if they changed some of their ancillary items to live up to the same standard as the rest of the food, they'd be a 5 star restaurant for sure.

The service is done in an old-school classic diner way, and all the wait staff at this location are very nice and attentive. Food comes out as quickly and as hot as you might get at IHOP or Waffle House, but up to a very different standard. And instead of sassy or rude service, you get treated like an old friend (especially once they start to recognize you, you're like a king).

Worth a trip from as far as Chandler, Apache Junction, Queen Creek, or south Gilbert for their breakfasts... but only their breakfasts. The other fare is decent, but doesn't hold a candle to their fantastic breakfast food. If you just want some great pancakes or want to splurge on a truly varied morning feast of anything you can think of, get to Black Bear."}
{"text":"I was visiting Phoenix for Thanksgiving and went to this restaurant twice for breakfast. The food was very good, especially the chicken sausage, fit scramble. The coffee was strong. It will definitely be the place I come next year when we return."}
{"text":"Miss the church crowd and come anyway but Sunday.  Breakfast, lunch and pies are terrific here.  The biscuits and gravy are to die for and the sausage is different yet fabulous."}
{"text":"Fresh fruit for breakfast and got an awesome 7 grain pancake. Only wish they had agave syrup. Everything else my family got tasted freshly prepared and not out of a box. Justin got waffles and David got an amazing Shasta (scramble) omelette with fresh spinach, peppers and fresh slices of avocado on top. If I ate eggs, I would have loved it."}
{"text":"It was pretty late for dinner (not by vegas standards). We were looking for something different than the Vegas Strip experience. 

The food was so fresh and amazing. We had a couple salads, a sandwich and a shrimp plate. Wow! 

The prices were so reasonable also. Chisty (our waitress) was very helpful also! I will happily go back give half a chance. You should also check it out!"}
{"text":"Yum! Really great food. Happy to see a location in green valley! Busy but no wait for a table. Food service a little slow but worth the wait! Great brunch for $35 for 2 ppl."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here while visiting the area for a football game.  Looked up good places to eat, and BBD was the one that seemed to top the list.  


Definitely a good place to eat...we arrived at around 10:15am and got lucky and just so happened to beat the bfast crowd.  We were greeted by the host, seated quickly, and our server made some recommendations. Apparently they are known for their chicken fried steak, but never have really been a fan of that particular item, so I opted for the corned beef hash and eggs. 

Wifey had the pancakes and eggs, and I got the authentic corned beef hash (not from the can, they say...and they are very serious about that).  It was actual corned beef, not really the \"hash from the can\" that I was expecting.  It was good, but I actually like the unhealthier stuff better.  The pancakes were nice and soft and very good, even though she opted for the grainier, healthier ones...but it wasn't bad at all.  A lot of the reviews said the portions were pretty huge, but I didn't find them to be that big.  I was able to finish almost all of mine, and had some of my wife's as well.  Of course, we had our daughter with us too, but she's only 2 and she doesn't eat much.  So all-in-all, very good value for the portions we got.  

The coffee was pretty good, had 2 cups black and didn't need anything added to it.  

Service was very good; quick and friendly.  When it got busy it was a little harder to get their attention, but they eventually got to us without too much of a wait."}
{"text":"Stopped by on the way to the airport. Wanted to get away from the strip and being broke ha ha oh well.
First this is a nice big new place. We were greeted at the door. And the workers could not be more friendly. 
I ordered the pot pie wife her usual burger 
I loved the filling of the pie, it does have mushrooms FYI.
She liked her burger. My only comment was the top crust was not flacky like the menu picture. But it was good.
Prices very reasonable. 
Sit back relax from the strip and enjoy"}
{"text":"I have been craving a triple decker BLT like Mom used to make.  I finally found it at Black Bear Diner.  The only difference is I had them hold the cheese.  Mom never put cheese on a BLT.  It was cut into triangles and held together with toothpicks just like Mom.  I didn't want any of the sides so I asked if I could pay extra and have a dish of fruit and was delighted when the waitress said - Oh you don't have to pay extra for that!  It was twice as much sandwich as I needed but I 'forced' myself to eat it.  Good food and happy memories of Mom."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with family.
Feels like a real diner!! Reminded me of diners back in NJ.
The menu is adorable, on a newspaper!
Good selections for kids, big portions.
I'd like to go back and see how breakfast is.
Simple decor, lots of families and seniors on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"I always LOVE coming here. It feels so homey and welcoming. Denise, and pretty much all of the servers are amazing and so nice. This business has grown so much and they've kept their hospitality. Ill definitely be coming here for a long time."}
{"text":"Heard the hype about this chain and decided to give it a shot. Ordered the corn beef hash eggs and sausage, great coffee and the homemade sausage patties are great. BUt the corn beef was horrible and the hash browns where under cooked the toast was dry. For the price I would not recommend Black Bear."}
{"text":"The biscuits and gravy were dry and bland. Scrabbled eggs were still runny. The Sunnyside eggs whites were undercooked"}
{"text":"My husband and I came to eat breakfast on Fathers Day, super busy but we were in and out in a reasonable amount of time. We were truly happy with the amount of food for the price, and the service from \"Trina\" was wonderful. She greeted us with the most genuine smile and provided great customer service! We will definitely be coming back with friends and family!"}
{"text":"I have been here 2 times now and this place is awesome. The portions are HUGE so you probably will have left overs. The price is average, $23 for two isn't bad for once in awhile breakfast. Service is fast & perfect. PANCAKES ARE SO YUMMY!! I don't usually like pancakes but they have some tasty pancakes. You definitely have to try it :) !!!"}
{"text":"The food was average. The corn tasted old and previously frozen. The meatloaf was average. My trout was average.  You do get large portions"}
{"text":"Breakfast for 1, or more like 2 or 3.  So much food but the spicy sausage patties are to die for. Staff friendly service fast and efficient"}
{"text":"It wasn't the best experience and we love Black Bear, or maybe just the one by Tropicana and Jones. We went on Monday at 2 PM, so it was a little bit over the lunch craze. The restaurant is almost empty save for a few people having a late lunch. We were seated at the booth across from the bar counter. Normally, a server would be with us even before my butt hit the chair, or the person who met us in the front would ask what beverages do we prefer, but this time it didn't happen and she told us that our server will be with shortly. After a few minutes, there was another lady server that came to us. Didn't introduce herself and promptly asked if we are ready to order. We noticed that she didn't have any pad or pen with her so I was thinking, hey she might be pretty amazing since my SO is very specific on things that he wanted on his burger. As we were telling her what we wanted, she kept on patting down herself obviously looking for something, checking her pockets and in a drone-like manner kept saying 'uhuh' when we told her our order. Now this is a red flag. 

It took them 5 minutes total to give my SO his coffee, which normally they would serve us in an instant and then forgot my hot water with lemon but instead gave me a cold water with ice. While all of this is happening, another server came, he introduced himself as Bernard and said that he is our server. Now I'm confused. Why did the first server asked us for our order and not write it down and messed up the drinks, the first part of the meal, while there is actually a person who is assigned to that area? Couldn't she have said that she's only going to get our beverages while we wait for our actual server? So we needed to repeat our order for Bernard once again. After my side salad came our food came 15 full minutes late or more that that. I'm not usually an adamant ass that times everything but I am observant. Probably there are hundreds of reasons why the food was late, maybe they were still slaughtering the cow that was to be processed for the reuben that I ordered or for my SO's burger. Or when the place is packed and really busy or feeding two huge groups of some varsity team, but this was MONDAY at 2 pm. IT WAS EMPTY.

 What really got me disappointed were two things: First, the two ladies that sat at the counter while the whole mess with the lady server and Bernard coming to us, so yeah we've been seated for quite sometime, RECEIVED their food FIRST before we did. And as I remember, theirs were sandwiches as well. The second one was really the cherry on top. When Bernard, I believe remembered that we haven't eaten yet, or saw the anger and disappointment in our faces, he reminded the cooks of our order, and the cook answered in a clear voice that we actually heard it said: \"It already went out.\" Now, both my SO and I looked at them and started to listen. Bernard, with the discomfort on him said to the cook, \"No, they haven't received it yet.\" and just to make sure he looked over our table again and proceeded to tell the cooks what we wanted. While they're having that discussion, we are getting more angry, hungry and disappointed. And as for Bernard, he went on serving the food for the other people that sat down LATER than us. He didn't even acknowledged the mistake or even went to our table to apologize and tell us that our food will be out shortly. THERE WAS NOTHING. 

When we finally received our food, I was just thinking to myself, hey let's just eat, pay and get out. As I said, my SO is very specific on what he wanted, and this man used to work for diners and restaurants so he would know if your food is a few hours old and just heated up. He told the two servers twice, that there shouldn't be any tomato, sauces, or mayo. Lo and behold, a tomato was dangling in the sandwich. If he has allergies towards the tomato, this would be a great LAWSUIT. So lucky, lucky us. We stumbled upon the absent minded crew of this particular branch. 

So after we ate, though my SO didn't eat half of his sandwich, I was waiting for someone to at least bring the check. So again, I looked over to the bar counter, where a man was talking to the cooks and saying hi to to employee who was about to clock in. I was trying to get his attention, while my SO was posting a review in YELP about them, and finally! made eye contact. But got ignored. He walked over the counter and then disappeared. Ok, now we decided to just leave and pay up front without the bill. When we told the girl by the register what happened, who else would come to the rescue but the manager who made eye contact but didn't even acknowledged that we might need something. I believe Corey was his name. My SO explained to Corey our disappointing experience and he promptly said, that he will take care of the bill. I will be more inclined to say Thank You for that if he didn't roll his eyes as if we're giving an excuse not to pay. All in all, NEVER AGAIN on this branch."}
{"text":"If you are really hungry for a big breakfast this is the place for you.  The food was excellent and the service was even better. Enat was our server and she was awesome. But it wasn't just her that impressed us, everyone was super friendly and personable. It was a great experience and we will come back next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Awesome chicken fried steak with country gravy.  The egg Benedict with  mushroom spinach and avocado was perfect"}
{"text":"I wish i could give this place 10 stars. I've been going to this place for over three 3 yrs now. Rey the Owner is awesome and this place has a great home town feeling. The food is also great and the servers are so welcoming and nice. Pricing is great - plates are full of food.
Love this place so much"}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love their pancakes they make them with vanilla and they are hands down the best place we've had pancakes here in the valley!"}
{"text":"Worst breakfast and service I had ever experienced, they served me cold pancakes, and raw potatoes! I asked for scrambled eggs with american cheese along with onions and peppers and the eggs came out with bacon and ham and pork sausage mixed in with the cheese on top. The server takes my food back and brings back the correct eggs and cooked potatoes however the pancakes did not arrive until 12 mins after the replacement order arrived. Instead of placing all my food on ONE PLATE she was on ass and brought them out on multiple plates which left us with no room on the table. The pictures where taken before the 12 min pancakes arrived as we requested our bill to leave. We won't be back at this location!!"}
{"text":"Good stuff! Had the Southern Scramble and it was awesome. Moving out of LV this week and never tried previously. Chain restaurant but feels/tastes like home cooked diner food."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this diner for years now. My week hasn't begun until I eat at Black Bear. Their giant portions and delicious food keeps me happy and full."}
{"text":"Food is good and large portions, great value. For weekends expect a 20 minute wait since they are very busy. Only gave 3 stars because of our wait experience. Unfortunately during our visit our wait was much longer because a large party of 13+ people who arrived a few minutes after us decided they didn't need to wait like everyone else because they were in a hurry and had to get to a championship little league baseball game. One member of the party cruised around the restaurant scoping out available soon tables and complained to the hostess/host. She was very intimidating and got her way. Many who arrived before us also had to wait longer because of the inconsiderate large group. If you have a large party and are in a hurry don't go to a busy restaurant and inconvenience others, plan ahead and get there earlier or go someplace not so busy."}
{"text":"I've been a frequent diner at Black Bear Diner when the Avondale location opened and thoroughly enjoyed my experiences there throughout the years. Was thrilled when they opened the Laveen location as. I live in Laveen. Unfortunately, every dining experience I've had at the Laveen location has been less than good.  A month or so ago a friend and I sat at the counter and were completely ignored for at least 10 minutes, even through we had asked if we were going to be acknowledged soon on two occasions.  Then, when our food arrived almost the whole order was wrong.  We asked to have it corrected, and the female server was not pleased and her facial expressions and body language showed her displeasure, so we shut up and ate what we were given. 

Now we have my experience from this morning.  Again, sitting at the counter, and the place being half full of customers, i waited and waited after being acknowledged by a female server who said she would be right with me.  About 5 minutes into waiting, two gentlemen sat next to me. Eventually the server came to take our orders, however, none of had received menus. I rattled off what I wanted and was very specific about how I wanted a particular item to be prepared.  The gentlemen next to me ordered, then the waiting game began again.. they received their order and I continued to wait.  All I ordered was bacon and eggs with hash browns cooked in the fryer.  I even joked with the server - asking if the cooks were waiting for the chickens to lay the eggs.  At one point she attempted to ask the cooks where my meal was and the completely ignored her...all the while I'm watching.  Anyway, my meal arrived and the hash browns were barely cooked, not fried and were luke warm.  

For a while after opening I just chocked up every bad experience as \"they were working through opening bugs\"..but now that they've been open for a while, I'll have to say it's just a bad!  I'll make the trip from Laveen to the Avondale location from now on"}
{"text":"sorry jamm's.. black bear diner has won my tummy. 

had a meeting this morning at work and usually a few of us follow up with breakfast at jamm's. i didnt feel like waiting for a table so i suggested black bear diner. my friend had eaten here several times with her dad and i only heard great things about it so i wanted to give it a try. one of my co workers had eaten here before and said it was good so we all agreed to grub here.

parking was easy! unlike jamm's. i'm lazy.. i always want VIP parking.lol.. it was nice to have more spaces available.

i had the portugese linguica sausage breakfast! (pics in the profile!) it was deeeeelicious. my co workers were staring at my food when it came and while i was eating. yeaaaaa i saw you!! lol. the portions are hearty and i was hungry so it was perfect. hash browns were thick and chunky and crispy and scrumptious! toast was thick and buttered just right i didnt need to ask for more. and the OJ!!! it was 3.69 for a glass... a little pricey? but im pretty sure it was fresh squeezed and worth EVERY penny. 

my friend got the cali omelette. dont know what was in it but i saw avocado and she ate it all so i know it must have been great.

services was excellent. we were checked on several times and drinks were refilled promptly. when my co worker asked for ranch the server remembered to bring it with her food. usually i have to ask again after i get the food but she was on the money. 

excellent choice for breakfast. i cant wait to try their lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"We came here tonight and the staff from the front to the back was incredible! When you go to eat you don't want just good food but a great experience too :) Alfredo was a great server and the staff worked as a team! I also apologize in advance if I butcher your name but Shaquilla was a great greeter! That position suited her personality! The food tastes better for some reason and I've been to other Black Bears around the valley but definitely check this location out! And it's close to home for me too :)"}
{"text":"Like going to grandmas house.

 This place is warm cozy and very inviting.  Upon entering you are greeted right away with a smile. Cozy booths or a sit at the long counter.  Samm our waitress greeted us with in second of being seated by our hostess. She went over all the food sprcial and took our drink order.upon bringing our beverage selection she asked kindly are you ready. And boy a good selection of food was present in the menu. 
Food arrived within ten minutes hot and delicious.   
 The sweat cream pancakes are definatly a signature plate here their big breakfast is garganchuan. 
Great sandwiches and dinner choices.  If yoy arrive on a week end morning get their early or come after 11 the place is packed."}
{"text":"The friendly and helpful staff makes up for the food. 

Had a Chicken Fried Steak meal. Got the soup as the side. It was clearly from a can and extremely salty, it came out slightly hot, more on the warm side, I should have sent it back.

The mashed potatoes were like glue, thick and blah. The gravy was very salty and so thick it looked like snot. It had sort of built a crust on top. The actual steak was pretty tasty and had a good coating. But again, extremely. salty. 

The mixed veggies were clearly frozen and WAY over steamed. They were just mushy with no flavor. 

I think I must have consumed an entire jar of salt in one meal. I needed a gallon of water to flush it all from my body

The other people at my table thought their food was OK.  Nothing to write home about. Their breakfast menu looked good and maybe we'll try it sometime. 

Note to owners. Instead of giving someone an 8\" diameter muffin or a 2lb potato, concentrate on quality and taste. I'd gladly pay the same or more for better food and smaller portions. GIANT portions doesn't mean great food."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, with my supervisor, and the server takes a bit, especially on the weekend, but the food is good.  My list visit I had a CFS the size of my face, that meal fed me for the entire day, and it was delicious.  Very  much comfort food."}
{"text":"Food was amazing as always, and Mindy was a rockstar!!! Best customer service ever!!! We can't wait to come back again :)"}
{"text":"Good place to eat dinner we need to go back to try their breakfast. But the dinner was AWSOME I put up a pic of what I ate.Service was very good we will be back soon."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat and I'm so glad they came to Laveen. We had the pleasure of having Jordan as our server again.He is very attentive. The food was excellent. My husband had the Spare Ribs and he said they were delicious. My open-face Turkey Sandwich was really great.Thank you Black Bear 

We had breakfast at Black Bear again. The Club Benedict was excellent. The thing we love most about this Black Bear is the service. Brandon was our server and he was awesome! He checked with us to make sure everything was good. He is always friendly and nice to everyone. Thank you Black Bear for coming to Laveen."}
{"text":"we were so hungry-got a great table and a very very nice waiter named Roman---we came out stuffed-I even bought a little bottle of honey......chicken fried steak was wonderful-huge pancakes-wonderful service-thanks roman"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. I've been coming here once a week on average for pretty much 3 years now. The staff are super sweet and are always happy and willing to serve. Also, they literally have the best BLT in town for the price, if you get the \"BLAST\" it is a sin to not also have a side of their ranch with bacon. Yes, sometimes whoever the chef is that day puts out food that's a little sloppy. Once I was a little freaked out because they gave me my breakfast with a side of dried out/rotten orange slices (but it was the \"garnish\" stuff on the side I never eat anyway). But the thing is, if you just point out what's wrong with your food, they are happy to fix it immediately. So if you want a bowl of chicken noodle soup, some chicken strips, or a BLT, this is your place. By no means should you come here with any higher expectations. There are stuffed bears lining the entire diner, honestly what sort of food are you expecting lol"}
{"text":"Me & my father come at least once a wk. The service has gotten way better than the first visit, the server Spring is very sweet & attentive! She is by far my favorite server there! The food is good & big portions!"}
{"text":"Great food a little pricier but great food! I had the Eggs Benedict with spinach, damn it was good.  Wife had something else I dont remember but she loved it too. I was craving chicken fried steak and eggs, I guess next time. We will be back."}
{"text":"Though I've eaten dinner here at this location two years ago and breakfast at the walnut creek location in September of 2009, tonight's food was exceptionally bad. The bacon wrapped chicken was not done on the inside and mostly reddish pink, the bacon was raw and the outside of the chicken reminded me of jerky in it's texture and it's inability to actually be cut with the butterknife provided.

Though the salad was good, the main dish was abysmal and I would sooner head to Claim Jumper or Mimi's on my way into town."}
{"text":"Great service and huge portions! Totally worth the wait and should be on your list of great places to take the family.
My husband had the California Eggs Benedict and it was really great! I had eggs and biscuits and it was simple but perfect."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, friendly staff.  My wife ordered the southern fried chicken, parmesan chips and garlic fries, and I ordered the smaller portion tri-tip dinner.  Problems from the start.  My wife's salad had rotten grape tomatoes on it and she was brought regular french fries.  When she pointed this out to the server he said they do not have garlic fries.  The chicken was a breast that had been pounded into a pallard, marinated in lemon and coated prior to frying.  The coating was falling off and was saturated in oil.  This is NOT southern fried chicken.
My dinner was NOT the smaller portion I ordered, it was the full platter.  My food was okay with the exception of the vegetables.

My suggestion to Gerald (our server) would be to write down the orders so you get it right.  Very nice young man, but saying they don't serve garlic fries when they are very clearly on the menu is ridiculous.

To the kitchen staff, if you offer southern fried chicken, it better be southern fried chicken and not what you brought to our table."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop in! I love the cozy woodsy feeling. The apple cobbler is really good and the western burger is great...just order a side of barbecue sauce because they didn't put too much on the actual burger. Service was friendly, place was clean. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Busy, but worth it - Chicken Fried Steak breakfast - excellent. Love them buscuits! Outstanding service by Trina and the staff is super fun and friendly. Go here!"}
{"text":"I live about 5 minutes from here and hands down this is my favorite breakfast place to eat at! The breakfast food + staff at this location is incredible and will always have me coming back for more."}
{"text":"Can't come to the area without stopping at this great establishment;
I'm not going to fluff it up to what it isn't- it's basic home style good comfort food.

Friendly staff, good quality food, big portions"}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere, good service, simple American fare, done well. Does get busy at times. Orange juice is really good, as though freshly squeezed."}
{"text":"Basically our second time here and quite impressed for everything we've tried tastes great. The french fries are fantastic. Good portion sizes and excellent customer service. Very reasonable prices too. As always forgot to take a picture"}
{"text":"Yes I really enjoyed their large portion of food and it taste so good prices are really great here I actually came back the next day and brought my step daughter"}
{"text":"Very friendly people!  Very busy which does suck at times but it is busy because the food is awesome!  I have only had the breakfast food--- Omelettes and Cinnamon Roll French Toast!  As good as it gets! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a typical old school diner. They have lots of comfort food and the prices are good. If you order steak dont expect the best cut. It was a little tuff and had those chewing cartilage pieces in it but the tastecwas good."}
{"text":"The breakfast was good, but didn't quite live up to my high expectations for Vegas foods. For the price, there's better food on the strip. That being said, Black Bear Diner has a nice hometown feel that I never expected from Vegas. This is a great place for locals or tourists trying to escape the hustle and bustle of the strip."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  The service is always great (some of the best wait staff I've ever come across) and the food is always on point.  I've ordered so many different things here and it is always fantastic. They have huge portions so come hungry!"}
{"text":"Heyyyyy it's good. Open faced turkey sandwich, is great. French dip is good too. The onion rings and fries are delish also. My grandma loves this place. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Great service , pancakes were fabulous ( i had bacon cakes). HUGE portions so bring your appetite. Others in the party had chicken and waffles ( was much better than the picture) and the chicken sausage ( which I ended  up eating quite a bit of).  Will absolutely return when back on the west coast."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped in for breakfast after a great weekend in Vegas.  The food was excellent..especially the hickory bacon(!)  But the big story..was that, as luck would have it, I dropped my keys in their parking lot and didn't find out about it until I got back to California(!)  So we call the diner and lo and behold, the Diner has my keys.  I gave them my information and 3 days after my dumba** loses them, the good people at Black Bear Diner mail my keys back to me, insisting I NOT reimburse them for the postal charges!  The manager there, Ray, was understanding, helpful and completely professional.  Not only was the food awesome, the \"service\" was outstanding.  ..Cant thank them enough."}
{"text":"This place has always been our go to breakfast spot. My son's love this place not only because of the food but because of the service we get when we're here. The kids are always greeted with a ballon given to them by the manager and not to mention their free breakfast on Teddy Tuesdays where kids eat free! The staff is great and the manager is really nice and always happy. The food has always been good but this review is mainly about how satisfied we've been with the level of service we get from this place."}
{"text":"Pros:
They make everything super fresh
They are attentive and super nice
Everything was fresh and tasty
The menus are cute with info from different times they have been open on the back

Cons
I signed up for the email newsletter and did not get my promised bear claw. boo

As we are visitors to Las Vegas it was a nice diner type experience. Not too expensive and very filling. Why not 5 stars? I really wanted that bear claw. Waitress said next time. Not cool."}
{"text":"A friend and I came in near closing time and were still welcomed and greeted with a smile.  We had the pleasure of having Ray, the manager, wait on us. He is so friendly, funny and personable. He stayed around and chatted with us and made our experience top notch. We will definitely be back on the nights that he works. 

Ps- thanks Ray, your suggestion for the creme pie was to die for!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had my doubts about this place as I was disappointed several years ago at a different black bear establishment..much to our surprise the food and service was perfect. Baby back bbq ribs...hamburger with side and chicken pot pie. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Went shopping at the discount mall south on Las Vegas Blvd. I was hesitant
to eat here as I previously was disappointed with another of this chain's 
restaurant on the far side of Vegas. 
Well this was a 5 star experience. Perfect good...excellent service..good prices . The wait time was just a few minutes as they were packed at noon on 
Black Saturday 25 Nov. 
I had the chicken pot pie...I expected to be disappointed...WOW a total great dish. My granddaughter had the BQQ ribs...excellent..excellent...excellent.
Her friend had a burger...very large ...looked great.
Be sure to register for their email special and get one of their bear claw pastries and coffee on your next visit for free. Love them. Also something extra on your birthday. 
I'll try the one Green valley Rd and Sunset as it's very near me. Hope it's as good as this place. I'll keep you posted."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place a 3.5 like the reviewer below me, but since that isn't an option, I too am rounding it off to 4. 

Yelp led me to Black Bear on Thanksgiving weekend. I just moved to Phoenix the day prior and I wanted some comfort food. This place hit it! So good! I've had their breakfast, salads and I had a burger for the first time today. The service is always good, the food always comes out hot and I've never had my order come out wrong. The lines can be a little long on the weekends, so be prepared to wait. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time yesterday and I had the best, biggest and fluffiest pancakes I have ever had! The prices are right and the portions huge!! I have no shame when I say I am planning on going back tomorrow with my mom."}
{"text":"Well I don't have much to say about this place...  It desperately need renovation! Its smelly and it looks like from 1970!  If you are looking for a nice dinner and nice atmosphere don't go there... It seems people who are eating there don't care about their surrounding.  All what they care about are HUGE loads of food on their plates.  Food is average,  service as well.  I will never go to Black Bear Diner again."}
{"text":"Went here with a large group and the staff was very accommodating and had no problem pushing tables together when more people came.     The food was good.  I had a \"small\" steak salad.  I put small in quotes because it was overflowing my plate.   I'm not sure how much bigger their large salad could be.     The wait staff could have been a bit more attentive but with a large group I'm more forgiving of that.    Everyone in the group seemed to be happy with their food.   

How can you not love a place that serves breakfast all day?"}
{"text":"Take a flying leap Denny's!  It's the Bear or nothing from now on.  I knew the portions were going to be huge so I ordered from the Senior/Small Plate section and  there was still a ton of food, easily 2000-3000 calories.  So a half order of chicken fried steak comes with smashed red potatoes, green beans with bacon (so f-ing good) big garlic bread and of course a dinner salad to start with.

Friendly service too.  This place surely doesn't suck."}
{"text":"This location is wonderful! The service was amazing and staff kept checking on us to see if we were helped upon arrival. Also the staff all had smiles on their faces. It nice to go into businesses and most or all employees are nice and greeted by smiles and great service. The food was scrumptiously delicious!"}
{"text":"Extremely busy @ 11:30 AM this morning. On a wait list- had about a 30 minute delay.
Got seated in a big booth : we were a party of 6. 
Our server was Janna - sweetest, most seasoned waitress ever! Loved her!
I had the Ruben sandwich you have a choice of a side. I went with the salad. It came separate from the meal ( like that) and was a good size! The sandwich was tasty & I couldn't finish.
My husband had the Grizz which is one of the most popular breakfast meals ordered. He enjoyed it.
Other meals ordered in our party was:  Cinnamon French Toast, 3 HUGE Pancakes, Bigfoot Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs, Bear's Choice & Joe's Hobo Omelette.
EVERYTHING was delicious! BIG portions for the price. Many of us had to take the rest of our meals home.
A must have : get a biscuit when you come dine. They're the most gigantic ones you'll ever see. Hight, light, flaky & fluffy, made fresh \"in house\" every morning! They're the BOMB!! 
FYI- they have green chili. It's an extra charge, but the prefect addition to any style eggs!
Ask to sit in Janna's section. She will go above & beyond. She'll treat you like family. I even got a warm hug on the way out! 
Great service , Great Food & extremely memorable experience!"}
{"text":"Nice place. I'm from NY so felt good to find a dinner , which isn't common out west. Extremely friendly and clean. Had grilled cheese and fries ... Felt like I was back in NY. Would return"}
{"text":"Great breakfast! What we would expect from a Black Bear Diner. The service was great & the pancakes were delicious! Everything we ate was great.  We will return."}
{"text":"We have been to several different Black Bear Restaurants and they are all terrific.  We travel a great deal and we are always looking for great local places to eat and this is  one of the best we have found."}
{"text":"Nichole was amazing! She was super accommodating to all my requests! Super yummy pancakes and the syrup was nice and warm! The eggs were cooked perfectly and he bacon was crispy. Just perfect! Thanks for a delicious breakfast!"}
{"text":"2nd time in a row we received this exact service we thought that the last time that they were off their game but now we know it wasn't.... ordered a pretty simple breakfast ; eggs soft scrambled bacon crisp the eggs came out so hard they were rubber and the bacon was so under cooked the fat was still a little white, like last time we sent it back the eggs came back a little better but again the bacon had been microwaved to the point of being unrecognizable!!! We're done...it's sad that as much as it cost to eat out that the cooks and servers don't take more pride in what they do...we have never had anything close to this happen to us at any of the California Black Bear diners that we have enjoyed over the years since they've been open...."}
{"text":"This is the best kept secret in Las Vegas.  The food is awesome!!!!!  My husband and I have been living in the valley for some 15+ years and eat out quite a bit, but we have never had such good American home made food in this town.  EVERYTHING is made fresh and from scratch!  Awesome...awesome...awesome!  We went for the first time early this morning for breakfast and back this evening for dinner.  The RJ really needs to get over to check this place out.  It will be voted BEST in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"It's diner food done right. Seating is roomy, wait staff is attentive. Portions are huge, prices are cheap compared to the amount of food you get. I've eaten at BBD's in 3 different states and it is consistently good diner fare. Their branding is exceptional and the bear decor every where makes it a cute place to visit. The breakfast food especially is on-point and served all day. The Chicken Fried Steak platter is freaking enormous amount of food even for a husky guy to finish. Since moving to Las Vegas we frequent the BBD on Green Valley Pkwy often and I make it a point to try something different each time just because all of their food is good.    It has become our favorite date-night/day place to eat out."}
{"text":"I like the food but the service was a little below par compared to other locations in the chain."}
{"text":"Breakfast here is always super good!! Food is in huge portions and just overall a nice environment along with a friendly staff"}
{"text":"It took me awhile to try this place.  Lines and lines... Decor is country and log cabins- cute
The menu is plentiful. Comfort food. I love the fact that you can pick from a smaller portioned part of the menu - the just right size for me :) 
We were greeted right away- no wait and everyone seemed friendly. The food was yummy. Did not get to try a piece of their well known pies or jam but will do so next time. Worth the wait"}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience at Black Bear Diner! Our server was John and he provided us with outstanding service, as well as the managers! The food was delicious, especially the pancakes. Probably my favorite pancakes now! The environment reminded me of Disneyland, lol. My boyfriend and I were hesitant in coming in because of the reviews on here, but I am more than glad that we gave it a shot! When you guys come in and eat here, ask for John. He'll treat you guys well!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast here and away from the chaos of the strip.  Great service and nice clean diner with good prices."}
{"text":"It took a few minutes to be seated on June 12,2018
They seemed to have been short a person at the front of the house. But once we were seated, the little bit of the wait we'd had was forgotten because the service was really good. The servers were attentive and so friendly. The food was good. My two companions had the open-faced turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy; both said it was very good. I had a BLT. The sour dough bread was toasted and the lettuce and tomato were fresh--one slice of tomato on the sandwich wasn't enough--it made the sandwich a little dry--so I was a little disappointed but the fries were very very good--nice and crunchy.  We would go back. But please, more tomato"}
{"text":"Excellent eatz!!! Due to high volume of folks in the morning breakfast was worth the wait (weekends). From breakfast menu the Grizz is a must! This place has the best hash brown around. Highly recommended this establishment."}
{"text":"This place was okay. We were seated quickly for a Saturday afternoon. I felt like the menu had too many items. Our server was okay. He was friendly but not once did he crack a smile. I got the chicken and waffle special. The waffle was good and the fruit that comes with it was more than enough, the chicken on the other had was super over done and had no flavor what so ever. My husband loved the chilaquiles and my mother enjoyed mikes chicken pot pie."}
{"text":"We have dined here a few times, and I'm surprised I haven't written a review yet! 

I really like this place. It has a comfy feel, like you aren't in Vegas anymore. My 3 year old loves the bears everywhere, and the jukebox. 

The food is yummy. Last night my mom and I spilt a cinnamon roll french toast for desert, and it was soooo good! Just the right amount of sweetness. 

I also ordered a side salad with ranch. Only downside is the the ranch has bacon in it. They don't have plain. Some people don't like bacon in their ranch. 

In the past, I have typically ordered dinner. The homemade biscuits are my favorite thing here. They are solid, soft, and buttery. I try to get one every time, even if I order breakfast. 

The servers are also always very nice. Last night, my active 3 year old wanted to sit at the bar in front of the kitchen. One of the employees ended up letting her help with restocking the coffee creamer. My daughter had a blast! 

I recommend!"}
{"text":"Equally as important to me as the quality and price of the meal is the professionalism and eagerness to satisfy of the management and staff. I am not impressed with huge portions but rather quality good tasting food. The food on both visits has been fine, prompt, and tasteful. I have issues with a server that doesn't listen intently and a management team that doesn't either instruct on customer service either initially or when a situation is brought to their attention. Listening is a required trait in the service industry, the old and well written quote is \"listen to understand rather than to respond\". No matter the industry when listening to take an order, directions, or instruction clear your mind focus on the person speaking and LISTEN."}
{"text":"Came in with a party of 6 and we waited over 15 minutes after being seated and had absolutely NO service. Table next to us was served 3 times.... won't be back. Shame on this restaurant!"}
{"text":"reasonable prices and friendly service. there was a lot to choose from on their menu. Their pies also look good but I unfortunately did not try one."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! This is the 3rd BBD I've been to and it's just as good as the others. It's simple, great service, awesome food and reasonable prices. That's the winning combination that keeps me coming back. 

You're treated like family here. Stop in and try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love diners.  I miss diners.  This one filled a void in my heart and stomach; I'm happy to have discovered it with a friend over my recent vacation.

Placed in a converted Chili's in Green Valley, this restaurant is at a great location with tons of parking and many other shopping places close by.  It's also next door to a public library.  The evening I went was very busy; the wait time wasn't fast but acceptable.  The decor favored black bears, for obvious reasons, with a very rustic/mountain feel.  It was easy to tell it was a small-scale chain due to their professional menus and their own brand of ketchup and hot sauces (all 3 were delicious: papa, mama, and baby bears! haha). 

The menu is typical diner fare, which is exactly what we were craving.  Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are served at all times.  I opted for the California Eggs Benedict and was in love!  The food did not arrive quickly, but was worth the wait.  My eggs came with fruit and potatoes, the latter of which was not on the plate.  As an apology, an full sized plate of the potatoes were brought to the table (I thought there was no way I could finish them, but I was wrong- too delicious to pass up).  The food was an excellent value; the iced tea was strong and tasty.

The restrooms were large and clean.  The staff was very friendly and helped each other.

I wish I had one of these close by!"}
{"text":"I have always had a great experience at Black Bear Diner.  We eat here at least once a month and look forward to the menu and service."}
{"text":"This review is long over due. 

On October 1st, I had one of the longest nights of my life. After attending the music festival Route 91; experiencing one of the biggest massacres in US history, held in lockdown overnight without eating or sleeping, my night hadn't ended. 

Around 10am, after walking to the airport to find an outlet where cars could pick me up from the strip, my friend wanted to make sure I ate, and we ended up at this Black Bear Location. 

I will never forget the kindness the manager and wait staff showed me this day. I could barely eat, tears streaming from my eyes, not being able to hold down a bite. The team was extremely gracious and sincere. They comped our meals, assisted me in cutting off my Route 91 bracelet and comforted me on one of the worst days of my life. 

I will be forever grateful for the kindness they showed. I'm so sorry this review took so long to compose. The owners should be proud. I'm happy to promote this establishment and what they do for the community. They truly showed what it was to be #vegasstrong. 

Thank you from the bottom of my heart."}
{"text":"I understand it's Sunday & Father's Day, but don't tell me 20 minute wait time if realistically it's closer to 1 hour.  After 40 minutes we ask how much longer??...\"oh, we have a party of 15 in front of you\".  Excuse me?? Time to bounce!"}
{"text":"Delicious. It's almost like you get that down home cooking. It reminds me a bit of a poor man's Cracker Barrel, but none the less the food is still amazing."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time earlier this week. I had a waffle with scrambled eggs and bacon. The bacon was super good and crispy. Portion sizes are perfect and the customer service was great. Service was quick even though they were pretty busy. The decor of the building really adds a nice touch to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I am always happy with the food here, both quality and portion size. The wait staff is accommodating and friendly. My girlfriend and I even order meals for pickup when we don't feel like going out in public.. Lol! Although we usually order breakfast (no matter the tone of day), their dinners are delicious too. I created a Yelp account may to review Black Bear Diner. Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Family had breakfast here Sunday around 12. It was very busy, but we were seated in around 15 minutes.   Coffee was hot and fresh. Our server was very pleasant, and attentive.  I got Bruce's meat lover omelette with hasbrowns, my husband got the thick bacon breakfast and our daughter got a mini volcano.  Everything was great, especially for the little one because it was after 11 she got a free scoop of icream lol Definitely great for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"We always look forward to having at least one or two of our breakfasts here when we come to Las Vegas. The breakfast portion sizes are large and we haven't had a bad meal here yet. I had the eggs and corned beef hash with potatoes. My husband had the eggs and pancakes. Our server was friendly and efficient. We have recommended this place to friends who have also enjoyed their experience here."}
{"text":"We came here early around 6am before we wanted to have breakfast before we took my Mom to the airport. We tried coming here before but the line was out the door and we didn't want to wait.

My Mom and I ordered the Sirloin steak and eggs breakfast, my kids shared some chocolate pancakes and my husband had the california club. I can honestly say the food was \"ok.\" 

Let me emphasize everything around me before I get to the food rating. When we first walked in, there were about 5 tables occupied (not a lot) BUT there was only 1 waitress so including us, that was a lot to 1 waitress. The atmosphere is cute, full of bears everywhere and we were able to sit anywhere we wanted. The waitress didn't need to write down our order, she memorized every detail to our order. WOW! I was impressed since there was a lot of small requests she had it down. I watched her zoom her way around catering to each table, she was really good at her job! Not only that, she was attentive and very fast to getting plates in the back. She's a friendly fireball! 

Let's get down to the food, my husband and kids loved their food. My Mom and I both had a room temp plate. Maybe it was just sitting in the back too long while my husband and kids food was being made. Our steak was bland so we had to use some A1 sauce, its actually not A1 but Black Bears version of it, it was too tart. Wasn't too pleased with my food.

I know they could have done better, I don't know if they were short staffed in the morning but the waitress really held it down for the restaurant. Even the manager gave a balloon to each of my boys. Sweet! I'm gonna give this place the benefit of the doubt, cuz I know there is still potential in my steak and eggs breakfast lol I'm taking away 1 star for that BUT, I do like everything else about this place. I didn't get the waitresses name, but that girl needs a raise!"}
{"text":"No stars I waited 20 minutes and walked out they helped people that got there after us thought this place was gonna be good but I thought wrong I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have never seen so many burly looking men in one place as I have at Black Bear Diner.  Is it the name or the huge portions that attracts them to this spot?  Anyhow, this is a pretty standard diner with very fast service and waitresses who wear support pantyhose and call everyone \"hon\".   They do have some healthier options but this is not a place to ask for brown sugar for your coffee or a gluten free menu."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with a friend and we got seated right away.. I ordered the scrambled bowl and it was pretty good.. our waitress was very attentive.. this location was a lot better then the other location we went too in chandler.."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and wanted to check it out. We ordered biscuits with sausage links and French toast with a side of corn bread.. I do have to say they do serve huge portions.. But their food was about average.. The only two things me and my BF liked were the corn bread and the sausage links.. The only thing I do have to say negative about their food was that the French toast my boyfriend ordered had really no flavor.. It was bland .. But their staff are friendly here and I felt that they do check up on you a little more frequently .."}
{"text":"Years ago, I reviewed the Black Bear Diner's original restaurant in Mount Shasta, California. I have a soft spot in my heart for this chain because it started essentially in my hometown's back yard, in a remote northern part of California that some call the State of Jefferson. You can see on their placemat, a black bear framed by the snow covered peaks of the extinct volcano, Mt. Shasta, in the background. I am pleased as punch that they have a franchise in Gilbert now that I am living in Arizona.

The food here is some solid, stick-to-your-ribs comfort food. The portions are huge. And it has that old-fashioned diner food vibe. This has been covered in many of the reviews posted by my fellow Yelpers. However, there are some unique nuances at this diner that you might have missed...

For one, they sell their own line of hot sauces. This includes Baby Burn (original cayenne), Mama Burn (green jalapeño), and Papa Burn (habañero). I am hooked on the Papa Burn, even though I'm not a huge habañero hot sauce fan. My tastes tend towards the cayenne and chipotle varieties, but this Papa Burn sauce is special. It has some serious heat from the habañero, but the best component is the infused black pepper flavor. Try it the next time you're here and you might just buy a bottle to go (like I did).

The other thing you may have missed is that the Black Bear Diner serves craft beer! Hop Rod Rye Specialty Ale and Big Bear Black Stout are the two offerings they carry from the Bear Republic Brewery. I have tried neither of these, but they sound delicious! I tend to frequent Black Bear Diner for breakfast, and really haven't made beer with breakfast a habit since college. I know the Yreka, California Black Bear Diner restaurant used to serve a special label craft beer brewed at the Etna Brewery, so I was pleased to see that the beery bear tradition continues at this Gilbert restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Shantel was a sweetheart. The music is was awesome! Food portion are large with a nice presentation. Prices are very fair. We will return!"}
{"text":"HUMONGOUS HOTCAKES! And my breakfast eggs were cooked just as I ordered them. And the homemade patty-sausage (choice of hot or mild) was incredible. Yep, I'm a new and big fan of Black Bear Diner for breakfast.  

Everything on the breakfast menu looked so good that it was hard to make a choice on my first visit here. But my choice was more than satisfying and scrumptious, so I will be back another day to try some of the other choices - - like French toast bear claws . . .how could you go wrong with that sweet treat?

I only had one small disappointment. The coffee was too bitter for me. I like mine strong, dark and smooth. Add cream and it should be a rich soft brown. But, I know how one likes their coffee, as how they like their men, is just a matter of taste, But, for me . . . rich and smooth, nothing bitter!

Bring it on Black Bear, I will return to this family oriented place for breakfast again."}
{"text":"My belly is crying because when ya girl wants biscuits and gravy, and when your biscuit isn't biscuit-y enough, ya girl is going to be upset! Biscuits should be dense, buttery, flakey, and all other words that remind you of biting into pieces of thick, multi layered dough heaven. When your biscuit texture resembles more like corn bread texture, don't get me wrong, cornbread is life, but it's going to throw off the taste of a traditional biscuit and gravy side plate. Texture/texture/texture!!! Very important! People often forget about texture consistency! It makes a difference! Anyhow, moving along! 

Service was very sweet! Huge portions! So Large of a menu it almost forces you to have ADHD. I definitely just picked out a category and like crossword puzzles, I waited for my eyes to blur and for a description to jump out at me. Worked pretty well if you ask me! I was happy with my order. Bummed about my darn biscuits and gravy, but portion size and item wise (rhyme intended) it was diner quality. I'd come back to check out their other options! Service and portions will keep me coming! Just don't expect belly excitement when it comes to their biscuits and Gravy. I'm still not over the disappointment."}
{"text":"Black Bear is pretty good and the best thing about it, the pricing. The food is good, the service is good, and you are not gouged out of your money for a decent meal. The staff is always friendly and my kids love eating their chocolate chip pancakes. I get the breakfast plate and my wife, who is not a breakfast fan (I know, I know...who isn't a breakfast fan? but well she is) orders something off of the lunch menu. We have not been disappointed yet. I would definitely recommend this place if you prefer to pay less than $40.00 for breakfast."}
{"text":"Me and my friends have been eyeing on coming to eat here and we finally did. Jonathan was an excellent server and made us feel welcome. I had the chicken fried steak breakfast and when it came, it was so DELICIOUS I didn't even realize that it had come with eggs! The steak was so good that the eggs were basically like extra credit. On top of that- I asked my friends \"who's 2 gargantuan biscuits are these?* They all said \"uhh yours bro.\" 

The supervisor at the time was Marlene and she politely asked if we enjoyed our dinner, to which we replied with \"yes, it was lovely.\" Safe to say we have a new favorite place to eat. 

-great service
-environment was inviting
-BIG PORTIONS"}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice in the last week. It is a great place for when you really don't know what you're hungry for. The menu has a wide varity, chicken Parm to pot roast. They also have breakfast all day. The sweet cream pancakes were so good. There is a hint of a spice, not vanilla but close, that I just loved. The thick cut bacon was great. So many places have junk bacon but here it's super tasty. My husband had the corn beef and hash, he really loved it, cleaned his plate. The pot roast tasted just like i hoped it would. Mashed potatoes were spot on. I saw several other tables that had great looking sandwiches, I'll try one next time."}
{"text":"Just ate here and it was delicious.  Erna was our waitress and she was in point with all her recommendations! The world needs more servers like her!

At my table, my family had the fried chicken, chicken fried steak, Cobb salad, and some burgers. They were huge portions and very good!"}
{"text":"Tried this place again, food was cold and not well seasoned. Waited 5 minutes for my moms food to get to the table after my partner and I had our food. Won't be coming back again"}
{"text":"Only my second time visiting a Black Bear Diner and I had a great experience. On my way out I gave the manager Juan a compliment on how great Zoe our server was...great music (from jukebox) and most importantly my food was Great Love this spot... as I drive Uber and Lyft full time (workcation) this is now a place a recommend to our out of town guest!"}
{"text":"Its Monday night and there are 3 families in here with 3 servers the MGR and 2 cooks yet our order was completely messed up and they brought my daughters food out separately first the hash browns, then eggs and 2-3 mins later the chicken fried steak.....I ordered a plain cheeseburger but it came with everything on it and the wait for a new meal was 5-7 mins which isn't bad but it is if your dinner party is nearly done eating their food the food was good but the service is terrible! When I spoke to the MGR 15 minutes after I asked for him he offered 15% off"}
{"text":"went here this morning with my friend from out of town and i'm pretty impressed. the food was really good and you can tell that the biscuits are made there. my service was also pretty good. but probably the main reason for the stars is the atmosphere. I really like how it feels like you're in a cabin and it's pretty cute! If you're in the area i'd definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"We had a failed attempt at going to brunch elsewhere so I popped on my app to figure out some of my bookmarks. It's funny, I used to live in walking distance, but I never tried to go then and a bit sad that perhaps I missed out. It was busy, but the wait was not long at all, about 5-10 minutes. We were amused and creeped out by the decor in the meantime. There are a bunch of teddybears lining a ledge around the main dining room. They somehow seem to just be looking at me, at all times. Hehehe. 

The BF and I shared: 

Chicken fried steak - I think this is one of the best ones we've had. Its really crispy and didn't sog up with the gravy. Gravy was flavorful and the combination of the too wasn't overly salty which I find many tend to be. 

Fajita chicken omelette - this was just OK. A bit too much peppers and everything was in big chunks that it would have been better diced up in it and with cheese present. I can't remember if it's supposed to come with cheese, but it should, I wouldn't order again. The egg itself is fluffy though so they can make a solid omelette here but these toppings I wouldn't do again. 

Your breakfast comes with a choice of potatoes or fruit. We tried both kinds. Normally I would pick country potatoes over hashbrowns, but their hashbrowns here are slightly bigger shreds are were good. The country potatoes has peppers and onions with it and those were decent too. My only critique is I'm going to order extra crispy on both next time as the country only had one side sizzled and the hashbrowns would be better with a more crispy top to contrast the soft potatoes below.

You get a bread as well. I got one of their biscuits which is pretty good of a biscuit that I normally don't eat a lot of my bread during breakfast, but I had to eat some with honey and butter. The BF really wanted a pancake, but a short stack is too much and their prices are odd in that it's only $1 less than a full stack so it makes it kinda not worth it. Apparently, you can sub your bread for one pancake and I don't think they charge for that either. We wanted a blueberry one and that was 99cents upgrade. This pancake was really good. I love that they put a lot of blueberries inside the batter since heating up the berries brought out their sweetness and the cake itself was nicely fluffy. 

Sidenote, I love their own bottled habanero hot sauce that is on every table. I sprinkled that onto my omelette. 

Service was friendly and attentive despite it being busy. She took her time giving us suggestions and answering our questions. We were checked on often and got our drinks filled efficiently. We were seated quickly and we were checked out fast as well. My first time, but it seems they know what they're doing. Despite it being a chain, it didn't feel like one and all items made from scratch is a huge plus. Most \"mom and pops\" don't make their own sausages or potatoes. 

We took home some treats too. Their bear claw was alright...the inside was plain sugar with strong cinnamon and not a smooth filling paste. It is better eaten warm and it's more puff pastry and not croissant like some people think it will be. It's one of those personal preference type things. Their blackberry cobbler had me confused as cobbler to me equals crumb top and crust on the bottom and this had crust all the way on the top. Once we opened it, there was only crust on top, none of the bottom just fruit filling hence the cobbler part I suppose since it's a partial crust only. It was decent with lots of blackberry in it, I just wish it was a actual mini pie because the crust was flaky. 

Even with a few minor hiccups/preferences, I was still pretty pleased so we will be back I'm sure. If you want big portioned all American, no frills breakfast, this probably should be on the shortlist of choices. If you are into chicken fried steak this will probably be the best you can get in the city."}
{"text":"Food was good. Portions were huge. And service was quick and friendly. The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because this was or third attempt at eating here. The lines get crazy long during peak times."}
{"text":"The corned beef has is made from REAL corned beef!! So delicious. Eggs over medium were cooked to perfection. Biscuits and gravy were spot on. I make my own sausage gravy so I am picky about my biscuits and grave. This one does not have sausage but is really creamy and has just the right amount of black pepper. 
Server was really nice. 
I wish it wasn't a million dollars in cab rides to get there and back from the strip but it was totally worth it!"}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience and I'm usually an understanding if not forgiving person. Where to start...the location is new and I have heard good reviews, but their recommendations where at different spots. 

Black Bear has this family, down home kind of feel to it with stone and log architecture and black bears peppered throughout. Staff was somewhat friendly and not rude. Our waiter was very inexperienced and I could tell the manager was helping in the kitchen, but ignoring the dining room. The restaurant sports \"comfort food\" and if fried food is comforting then this may be your spot. However with this type of statement when I order lemonade I expect a home recipe not minute maid!

I ordered the 6oz tri-tip with shrimp and mashed potatoes an gravy. My wife had the fried chicken with baked potato. Both came with seasonal vegetables  (I want you to remember this!) A cup of clam chowder was my starter and the Mrs had salad. When my wife asked about salad dressing the waiter says \"We don't have Italian or french.\" So my lady asks again which dressings they have - he repeats himself adding they have everything else. Um...unless you carry every type of dressing in existence don't give half assed answer like that. 

Oh by the way I never saw my soup. Turns out they ran out of it but I didn't get to know that gem of truth till after our food was served.

My tri-tip was undercooked and very chewy. My wife's chicken was so dry you could probably rub it together and get fire.

The seasonal vegetables, yeah - you would think that a statement like that would mean it is a batch of tender veggies to spread across multiple plates. Evidently with Black Bear they make different batches and cherry pick who gets what. I got green beans and my fed up angel got squash and zucchini melody. Neither are bad really but just hammers in the final nail of inconsistentcy.

We didn't even bother with desert because we were already so underwhelmed with our experience I began to feel bad for the tree that gave it's life to be our bill paper. 

Their a month in and I hope they get the guidance they need. Breakfast may be better, but I will never know. Black Bear is now off my radar!"}
{"text":"I tried the *NEW* (or at least it's marked that way) Bear Claw French Toast.

Holy cannoli, it was good!  I'm STILL full over 4 hours later and I didn't even finish the entire thing.  

My husband had a meat lovers omelette and devoured it.  He wasn't a huge fan of the hash browns (he orders them burnt and they never come out that way - I suppose the kitchen is just trying to cover their behinds lol) but that's not a deal breaker for this place.

Seriously, HUGE portions.  Fast service on a weekday morning is a big plus!"}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!  Everything was as perfect as could be, from the food to the service to every single employee we passed on the way to our table greeting us warmly!

Sarah was our primary server, and she was awesome!  However, the whole team pitched in at various times to ensure we had every detail covered. The food was ready very promptly, and four servers helped deliver it as we had a party of seven, so that everyone got piping hot food. 

Thanks to all for starting our day so well!  Whoever is running this place is really on top of things!!"}
{"text":"Great big portions of American Traditional food. Chicken Fried Steak was delicious. Tried some dessert as well, and it was damned good. Staff was attentive and nice. Wife and I will be going back."}
{"text":"If I could zero stars I would. We spent over 30 dollars for an ice cold burger, and biscuits and gravy. Not to mention we waited over an hour for our food. Waiter was nice enough, but we will NEVER return. Upon paying at the front, the young girl asked if everything was ok, we told her no, but got no response, so we asked if she even cared. Her response was, she wasn't in the kitchen at all, so it's not her fault. She definitely is too young, and immature to be the first, and last face customers see. Horrible experience. You all should be ashamed."}

The place was so cute with a cabin feel to it.  Warm and inviting!!!
Menus looks like the town's newspaper which was very cool!!!
We ordered the basic breakfast plate: 

EGGS BENEDICT - expected a bit more out of the sauce
                                tasted like butter was poured over my eggs & ham
                                I added lotz of hot sauce to kill the butter taste

PANCAKE - my son LOVES pancake.... and especially from IHOP
                   with that being said, that's not hard to beat cuz IHOP is very basic flavoring
                   well with the exception of it being so huge, the pancakes here was flavorless
                   syrup did not make it anymore tastier
                   due to it being so big, it was a bit dry

CHICKEN FRIED STEAK - so looking forward to having the gravy with biscuits
                                           steaks were crispy and just enough salt on the breaded part
                                           I just wished that the gravy was a bit more bold and not bland

THE GRIZZ - this is enormous for sure....
                      its something that could be share or for one big boy
                      this is a combination of everything above all together so I wont go into details

Its a nice, quaint, and friendly place that would definitely get a 4 Stars from me if there was a bit more flavors on they plates... but the real reason why I gave them only 3 Stars is becuz....

                  NNNOOO!!!  HASHBROWNS !!!

What the heck! How do they not have HASHBROWNS!
We should have walked out when we found out.  SO SAD.. :-("}
{"text":"WOW! We've eaten out many times since moving to Vegas 8 years ago, so it takes a lot to surprise us. Consider us surprised with Black Bear Diner! You can get huge plates of food all over but most of the time it's a huge plate of crap. 
My wife got the pancakes and I had to fight her for a bite. I work the graveyard shift so getting dinner for breakfast is always appreciated. I even got mashed potatoes at 8 on a Sunday morning. Mom got a biscuit bigger than her head (and tasted amazing) Dad's chicken fried steak was so good I don't think he said a word and even ignored his work phone when it went off. 
Yes, we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Food is good and service was great.  Not a good choice for handicap access though. We have eaten at the other two Black Bear Diners and wanted to try this new location since it is closest to home.  I did not see any handicap parking close to the entrance.  Similarly, there was no handicap access ramp near the entrance (I did not see one at all).  Since I use a walker, just getting from the parking lot to the hostess station was an effort.  The other locations have much better access if you have a disability."}
{"text":"Corn muffins are yummy 
The apple sausage and all the breakfast foods are really good 

A fun place for kid 
S"}
{"text":"People talk this one up, but to me it was pretty gnarly. I am definitely biased against chains, so take this for what it is, but if you're going to have locations in multiple states- please do breakfast right. Corned beef hash was not good. Not even like it could have been helped. It was not good. Won't go back unless under duress."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of black bear for years. My grandma is the one who introduced me to this diner adorned with black bears everywhere. The one we used to frequent is quite far from us but they've recently opened this location in the green valley area and one very tired night I was craving pot roast and I knew the exact place to come to. That is my go to order here. The portions are huge it's always delicious and I always have more than half of my order to take home. Boyfriend wanted pot roast too but I told him to order the turkey and we would share. It's a smaller portion and didn't come with soup or salad like the larger order so next time he said he will go with the pot roast. They have breakfast available all day and typical diner food. The service is always good and the food comforting. Great family place to come too especially if you love bears!"}
{"text":"This will be short and to the point.

Coffee was GREAT
Service was as expected for a breakfast place. She was around when needed, checked back, provided refills, was friendly. Certainly no complaints with the service.

Decor was fine and typical for the theme they were going for (lodge/bear type feel)

I ordered chicken fried steak which came with 2 eggs, and hasbrowns and my coffee which came to $10.00

Chicken fried steak was good but not great (Blueberry hill has the best country fried steak), the gravy was good, hasbrowns were good. 

Their biscuit was huge and only had a tiny bite and didn't care for it, 

I was disappointed though for $10 for breakfast especially here in vegas, all breakfasts should come with bacon or sausage and pancakes.  A side of any of this was at minimum $3  Their portions were huge but remember, bigger portions doesn't mean it's a better breakfst.  I've had smaller portions at dennys but for the same money I got more food because I got a main item, eggs, hashbrowns, bacon AND sausage AND pancakes AND coffee for UNDER $10


So on that little point, they can't compete with other places.

Overall food was alright, not great, certainly not bad by any means. I would go back, but wouldn't go out of my way to go there specifically though."}
{"text":"I like to support local business and decided to stray off the strip for breakfast my last day in Vegas and opted for here due to the reviews.  Wish I hadn't.

food- 3 stars.  I had the Small Volcano: one egg, one sausage link, onle slice bacon, and 3 pancakes (I tried the 7 grain almond granola ones that are supposed to be their specialty).  ok but nothing earth shattering.  syrup very watery.

service-1 star.  Sorry I was not a family, or a senior citizen, or a local regular, but that does not mean I should be treated like amoeba.  I was never asked how things were or if I wanted anything else.  But what really irked me was when she gave me the check I asked if I could pay her or if I had to take it to the cashier she told me cashier.  Fine, no problem if that is the way things work.  BUT then she walked straight to another table by me and took their check and said she would be right back with their change.  Wow.   I still gave her a tip but it would have been bigger if she hadn't pulled that."}
{"text":"I love this place! This down to earth country feel diner is really good! I normally go on fridays for their all you can eat Fish and Chips.. The service is great, the entire atmosphere had a laid back feel.. Their open face turkery sandwhich is  pretty good too.. just love the overall feeling on this place.."}
{"text":"Wanted to LOVE this place so bad as it is right around the corner from my new apartment. I'll start out by saying I will be back to give it another try in the future. A buddy of mine met up with me here for dinner a few nights ago and we were both in the mood for breakfast (+1 for ALL DAY BREAKFAST!)
I had to laugh as we didn't realize that the small newspaper that was put on the table actually was the menu! The waitress came to take our order and we asked for menus. She looked at us kind of funny and laughed. Honest mistake! lol
Anyway, my food was decent. I ordered the Volcano (pancakes, eggs, bacon and sausage) and my buddy ordered some dish with eggs, home potatoes, Portuguese sausage and a biscuit. His food came out warm at best and his potatoes seemed a bit overcooked and lacking flavor. My pancakes were good, eggs were eggs, the sausage was eh and the bacon was terribly overcooked and dry.
The decor is fun, cheesy and could possibly be a bit frightening if you are not a fan of bears or stuffed animals.
All in all, not a horrible experience and seeing as it serves breakfast all day and it's right around the corner I will probably be here more than a few times. Hopefully other menu items are better and I'll update my review from there."}
{"text":"After living here in Vegas for 10 years I decided to visit the diner tonight with some friends who were in town visiting from California who had been to the diner's California location. 

Boy have I been missing out, such an amazing experience. Food was fantastic, service (our server was Anthony) he was phenomenal and the evening shift supervisor (Marlene) was absolutely Divine such a beautiful spirit and great personality. 

Pancakes with just the right amount of chrispy-ness around the edges, Patty melt Burger on grilled sourdough was succulent and the blue cheese dressing I had for my salad an the side of Ranch and Thousand island dressing's not sure if they were housemaid or not but some of the best I've had. 

This spot is a must visit sorry it took so long for me to discover it however I will definitely be back quite frequently to catch up on the years I've been missing out. 

Should you ever visit (the Las Vegas Tropicana location) I would recommend requesting Anthony as your server. An as a side note he has such amazingly piercing eyes and he smelt fantastic."}
{"text":"It is really hit or miss with this place but I will always be back. I think it might be the different cooks that make it this way, but the staff is friendly and the portions are huuuuge. Its worth it"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast! Everything was home made including biscuits. Reasonable prices and great wait staff. Shandi was a great server and was kind enough to warn me about the huge portions so I ordered lite fair which I still couldn't finish."}
{"text":"Lots of mixed reviews have been written about this place, so we decided to judge for ourselves in Vegas last week. Three of us ate about 11 AM on a Monday. They advertise a BLAST- bacon club with avocado. All I can say is, \"My compliments to the photographer.\" The bacon was very skimpy and the sandwich was nothing special. My hubby's linguica and eggs was good, but again, just average in flavor and overpriced for the portion. I had a meatloaf sandwich, my personal benchmark for a decent diner. Thin sliced toasted sourdough, piles of thin sliced red onion strings, and gobs of sloppy BBQ sauce. Based on 3 different items and not one Delicious, we will not be back. Our dishes should have been $6.95 each, not $9.95."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in the food. We went on a Saturday afternoon and while busy, waited less than 5 minutes. Our service was great, great theme of the restaurant but the food- probably the worst of the worst.

I ordered the Hungry Bear Breakfast and my hub and ordered the Biscuits and gravy. We were told the portions were huge. True. The eggs were from a powder, the sausage gravy was more of a paste, probably the worst gravy we had tasted, no flavor whatsoever. 

It really turned us off because the food did not match the amazing service we had! I'm hoping to get the courage to go back and try a lunch or dinner item one day."}
{"text":"Love coming here for breakfast. The wait is usually between 10-20 minutes on the weekends but the food is worth it. The portions are huuuuge (trump voice).

I usually order the Grizzly breakfast which comes with ham, sausage, bacon (thick and to die for), hashbrowns, 3 eggs, and pancakes. WHEW! All for about $10. 

Out of our 6-ish experiences there, only 1 was sub par. The bacon wasn't cooked all the way, the waiters were inattentive, and the eggs came as 2 instead of 3."}
{"text":"Don't believe yelp if it comes up as a good place to go for gluten-free peeps. I searched for gluten-free breakfast and brunch and ended up wanting to apologize for selecting it from the list. If you're gf and like eggs, though, there are lots of choices."}
{"text":"Portuguese sausage plate was big. The sausage itself was almost a foot long! The hash was very good if you enjoy crispy hash. The biscuit is made in house and just falls apart when you pick up. 
Overall, great friendly service, decent price, and good food."}
{"text":"Visited while we were in Las Vegas staying on the strip. Decided to venture off the strip based on the Yelp reviews and check out this place. Best decision! Took a Lyft and it was a 15 mins. ride from the strip. Great food and great service. The food was delicious and good size portions for the price. Very happy with our choice. We ended up at a strip buffet the next morning for breakfast and we sooo regretted not coming back here instead. This will definitely be our new breakfast spot when we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is as cozy as it gets!  The atmosphere is warm, the service was wonderful, and the food tasted like it came out of mom's kitchen.  The wait staff was super friendly and genuine.  Loved that~!  Will be going back for a long time to come since they're right down the street.  If you want good food with a homegrown sort of feel, go to Black Bear Diner!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times since it's opening in Laveen and I've had a good experience each time. It's a good break from just all the fast food."}
{"text":"I really, REALLY wanted to like this place.  How can you hate on a place that is decorated with teddy bears?  Seriously now... I'm like an overgrown she-child, so this place should have been paradise for me.  Instead, I left with a bad taste in my mouth, both literally and figuratively.

It took us ten minutes to be seated.  The woman at the cash register up front wasn't the hostess (I guess), so she left to find someone to seat us.  We waited FOR-E-VER for someone to finally show us to a table.  Then, we sat for another ten minutes after deciding what we wanted to eat for someone to come take our order.  I ordered a cup of chicken noodle soup to start.  It was tepid at best and exactly the same consistency and overwhelmingly salty flavor as Campbell's Chunky soup.  For my meal, I ordered pot roast.  Over 50% of it was fat.  The sides were pretty nasty as well... a hard and cold baked potato and burned vegetables.  My fiancé's turkey dinner was so bad that he left it untouched like it was an alien life form.  

The service was the worst part.  From start to finish, the waitress was surly and rude.  It was like we were ruining her day by just being there.  I really, REALLY tried to be nice, but it seemed like she was more mean the nicer I got.  I couldn't WAIT to bolt out of there.

Seriously, people.  There are better diners in this city.  Maybe I had a random bad experience, but besides the decor, there was nothing I liked about this place."}
{"text":"We had breakfast twice while in town over the holidays. I had the corned beef hash both times and it was simply amazing! As the menu says this stuff isn't from a can! My hubby had the cinnamon roll French toast on the second visit and loved it. I have t had their lunches or dinner but of it's like their breakfast you will enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Love me some Blackbear! Always huge portions of delicious food and excellent service. Our families favorite place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Never even hear of this place till we drove by. Definitely like an IHOP/ Denny's/ Mimi's cafe. The portions are huge. Not the best food but a good place to just get out and go to. We had our kids with us and my son who is one, the staff couldn't get enough of him and they were all so friendly."}
{"text":"First time.  Long wait. But usually cause food is good. 
Had breakfast. Large portions. Food was great for the price. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"on a recent vegas trip, the crew wanted something different. hence, we ventured off the strip to look for some 'local' eateries. 'black bear diner' popped up on yelp. because it had bear in its name, i said hell yes!

anyhow, this place looks like it came out of some ski/snow resort up in tahoe. awesome and pretty at the same time. i think their theme is \"goldie locks and the three bears\". they had a lot of wooden bear statues - perfect for photo opportunities. did you know that black bears can practically run up trees? crazy.

the yelp reviews raved about the pancakes. unfortunately, i'm not a pancake fan. maybe i just haven't had any decent ones growing up. so we all stuck mostly to the typical breakfast food - omelets. i mean, if you mess up eggs, you're not really much of a diner. i got the california omelet and boy these yelpers sure weren't kidding about the portions. it was LOADED with avocado and mushrooms, inside AND on top. i've been trying to avoid those buffets in vegas because of the quantity - this was equally as bad. 

the actual omelet lacked flavor, so i had to play with the salt a bit. the amount of avocado, bacon, and mushrooms made up for it. the biscuit, though large and house made, was rather flavorless without the butter + honey. the only constant that you can't go wrong with are the potatoes. i chose the red potatoes over the hash brown because it had a little bit of green - bell peppers. 

4 stars - 3.5 for the food - extra .5 for the decor."}
{"text":"Let me just start with this: fries cold to the touch. Wandered into this new location hungover on a Sunday and I don't know which was more painful; the dining experience or the hangover I was experiencing. Waited for a table to be greeted by a very bland server after sitting for several minutes. Forgot to give us straws. Would avoid eye contact with us throughout our meal so she didn't have to check on us. Everything seemed inconvenient to her. First and last time at black bear diner. You made my hangover worse."}
{"text":"My son and I always like coming here for breakfast lunch or dinner (Sahara and Durango location) and love their little cream pies that are always so fresh...can't wait to go again"}
{"text":"Have been here now on two occasions. They have huge portions - too big for me but go down a storm with the rest of the family. Only comments for improvement are that the seats in the booths have not been wiped down and on both occasions there has been a wait to be seated and for a cashier to appear to pay the bill. Front of house needs work but food and service once seated is good."}
{"text":"I love there ribeye steaks in the morning. It's a true go get it. I'll be back. Great service"}
{"text":"Folksy atmosphere with log cabin style architectural elements, bear paintings, and fun carved bears like the one at the entrance with a bear hugging a honey pot having bottom of the pot drilled by a bear underneath with an actual old drill.  '50s/60s music add to the fun atmosphere as does getting one's menu on a newspaper highlighting local ads and events from the past: interesting and clever! Went with 3 others and we let each other have tastes so here's what we thought. Biscuits did not seem at all like the rolled and cut style we long for when we go out--you know, the kind where the shortening makes tender layering and the outside has a browned crusty top and bottom reminiscent of the dutch oven campfire style. These were paler, larger, shapeless, and dry enough to crumble when you tried to cut them.  Biscuit gravy started congealing way too quickly. I like my bacon well done, but when it borders on black, it's overdone because you can't taste the meatiness and just get the crunch--might as well be bacon flavored crackers.  Hard to find good sausage in skins anymore since it's easy to ruin them so most places yield to the patties, but theirs had a tender skin browned enough to seal in the juiciness and provide slight crispy resistance to a mostly sage flavor: excellent. My medium over eggs were prepared perfectly with no slime and no tough yolk, but the shredded hash browns weren't heated through and didn't have the requisite crisp--probably not enough oil since they were dry, and I probably should celebrate less grease, but I didn't order them cooked dry so some grease is expected for proper crunchy effect. My friend's English muffin wasn't high enough to have noticeable nooks and crannies and was so doughy it looked like someone just wishful whispered \"toast\" rather than actually putting it anywhere near a toaster. His chicken fried steak didn't have a seal-in-the juices flour coating but seemed to be more like dry bread crumbs and the meat was dry. His home fries were browned well but could've used more onion to actually add some flavor. The turkey, avocado, bacon on ciabatta tasted fresh, but the fries were probably not made on site or they went through heroic efforts to make it seem so--dry and bland. Our meals were enhanced with the 3 types of hot sauce, Papa, Mama, and Baby Bear versions in varying degrees of heat. It was fun to try them all or to combine them. The little cobblers and pies in the dessert display looked delicious. The banana cream had already sold out and there was only one coconut left, but we weren't craving any after our heavier than usual meals so  considered taking one home but it looked like they were baked in the dishes so am not sure you could get them to go, and since there was a big line behind us and in front of us and we running late, just didn't bother to ask. However, if you could, they should have a sign making it clear since the pie case is right by the cashier."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast had the Huevos Rancheros they were so Good! Staff was extremely nice and had a funny send of humor! Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 8 and it was fast, and great food. From the breakfasts to the ribs. The portions are HUGE, which is probably why it's on the more expensive side (for a diner). I love places with all day breakfast, and there's such a variety on the menu I can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"My last meal at the Black Bear Diner in Mesa, AZ was terrible 
. I went with my boyfriend for an early breakfast before preparing to move, and she kept on rushing us multiple times asking us if we needed a box when I only ate half my waffle and one of my chicken strips. I know it was busy, but that was the worst service I ever had. I was enjoying a meal with my boyfriend and it was anything but enjoyable. You guys usually have the best service ever, but it fell short that day."}
{"text":"It was busy because of the holiday, but again well worth the 10-15 min wait. Service was excellent like last vist. Food was delicious. Will Def be back again."}
{"text":"Big portions, great food and Shannon is an amazing server awesome place I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner is one of my fav places to take my family when we all get together and anytime I can get away just to have that Good Ole Home Cooked Delicious Meal. The food is excellent!! The portions are large!! And the people are amazing and treat you like family! We had accidentally stayed past closing time yet no one mentioned it to us nor another family.  There was no vacuuming, putting chairs up around you, which is why we ran a bit over~ We had just picked up friends & family from the airport and had lost track of time... We made sure we showed our appreciation in the tip we left but it was so refreshing to have a family get together where EVERYONE was amazed at every aspect of the dining experience!! BLESS YOU!!"}
{"text":"Service is always terrible, but if in the mood for average, but bland
 comfort food you are in luck."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant today in the morning! I got the BIGFOOT Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs. 
It was pretty good ! Excellence portions ! John my server he was good too ! But there's something that I'm disappointed I think 4.00 bucks for orange juice it's too expensive !"}
{"text":"I had breakfast here with family on Saturday and the food was good, portions were generous, it was served hot and in a timely manner. We were seated promptly in the rear of the restaurant at a large round table. The waitress who appeared to be serving our area looked in our direction and walked into the kitchen. She came out of the kitchen and proceeded to stand and talk with other wait staff. we were not acknowledge us or come in our direction. As we continued to wait Shandi who was serving another area came to us and asked if we had been served. We said \"No\" she apologized for the oversight and immediately brought us beverages and took our order. She said she would expedite our order since we had been waiting. She could not have been more apologetic and pleasant. She talked with my grandson and was delightful to all of us.  She was not only serving but also busing tables when patrons left. She is an asset to your business. She turned an almost bad experience into a favorable one. I will come back next time I'm in LV. You need more people like her."}
{"text":"SAINT PATRICK's DAY, 2011. 

we were all tired. we'd been on the road since early afternoon and it was already a couple hours passed our regular dinner time when we pulled in -- everybody was plenty hungry.

i know corned beef is a JEWISH deli thing (does anybody in IRELAND actually eat corned beef ???) but i ordered the REUBEN anyway. if you're used to those sad sandwiches with meat right out of a plastic bag, try one with juicy, freshly made corned beef. 

WOW !!! now that's a REUBEN !!!

the cole slaw side was creamy and delicious (and not too sweet).

everybody else seemed to enjoy their food. i'm really not sure. i was too tired and enjoying mine too much to notice."}
{"text":"We usually like this chain for a good hearty country breakfast, but our last visit was a real disappointment. 

The waitress was pretty indifferent. Got the order wrong. Had to be asked twice for a glass of water. 

The hash browns were under cooked. Almost raw potatoes. The chicken fried steak was dry. I asked for the gravy on the side. Didn't get it at all. The toast was cold and soggy. 

In all, not worth the $26 check for two breakfasts."}
{"text":"The best breakfast around! The cinnamon roll french toast was the bomb diggity as was our waitress! She was very attentive and always made sure I had hot coffee! Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and not once have I had a good experience! This time it will be the last. I don't ever ask for a discount when food is messed up. But today they over charged me on my kids drinks and the cashier said that because the waiter didn't serve it in a kids cup that I had to pay full price. For one I didn't ask for the bringer cup that is just how it came. She gave me attitude and apparently thought because she added a have a good night it would make it ok. Well it isn't. There food is always cold, takes forever and the staff always has attitude. I do not recommend it!"}
{"text":"OK diner

Standard diner with a huge breakfast menu that you can order from all the time.  Nothing special or different from similar chains, except maybe more dated decor.  HUGE portions will appeal to some and seems to cater to the older crowd.

Fine options, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and club sandwich and fries. Been to both the Las Vegas and Napa locations and food consistently good. Atmosphere feels like you are in the Northwoods, very homey and comfortable feeling place. Waitresses always friendly and give great service."}
{"text":"Ok, This is an official I would leave a 2 1/2 stars if I could review...
 We went here 4 times, in the end we decided they are basically mediocre or ok depending on what you get for the most part.
These are the entire family reports so far:
 Breakfast, pancakes are awesome , Pot roast is pretty good. Basic breakfast is just that basic don't expect much. The huge hamburger had very little taste, the tri tip dinner was AWFUL!!! Pies are to die for.... Dinner in general is a stretch.. best to keeping it to a signature lunch dish or breakfast...
 We stopped going here and will go back to Weiss down the street.... maybe someday we will go back for pancakes... The wait staff was nice..."}
{"text":"I love this place. I come here frequently for lunch with my coworkers. Everything I have ordered - turkey club, the open faced turkey sandwich, the breakfast, the desserts all sooo delicious. It is also a really cute restaurant!  Love all the bears! The service is also pretty fast and efficient too."}
{"text":"Bacon cakes were amazing as was the bacon. Great coffee. Nice find!  Great for breakfast. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"OMG!! What a hidden gem tucked away in Henderson, NV.  We have been driving past this diner every day for a year now. I said you know they must have good food because their parking lot is always full. Well that was a understatement!!! The food is mouth watering good. Everything we ordrred was freash and tasty. I read where someone compared it to Cracker Barrel. That's an insult they are above CB!!! Let me also mention the BIG healthy portions and resonable prices. Whatever you do, please do not leave without having their honey buttered  muffins.  Eric was our server he was the best!!!  #SLAPTHECOOK"}
{"text":"I dine at Black Bear diner frequently with my mother.   The service is always great.  The staff are wonderful and the food is delicious.  I specifically want to call out servers Gary, Mary and Loraine.  They are fabulous.  Manager Robin comes around to make sure everyone is satisfied."}
{"text":"Went to this place in Phoenix in the evening.the vegetables were frozen not cooked.Floors are dirty, they do not clean before seating.Service is bad,food is awful"}
{"text":"Yay! I found my new breakfast place. I took my boys here after cello lessons and it was as a real treat. The decor is cute and reminds us of our time in the Tennessee mountains. From start to finish the staff looks after you. They are happy to offer opinions, and answer questions. Th portions are huge- two plates was easily enough for all of us with theft overs. Now I live a good biscuit. And these were some of the best. They were like little towers of buttery happiness."}
{"text":"Took my family to a late lunch early dinner, and it was awesome. Warning the portions are huge, and delicious!! The pancakes are so yummy, and everything was fresh. From the hash browns to the corn beef and cabbage to the fresh squeezed orange juice! And the best part is you don't feel guilty taking left overs home because the PACKAGING IS ECO FRIENDLY!! We hate plastic and styrofoam, because of its horrible impact on the planet! Thank you Becky for the great service, and the manager was super friendly too! Definitely will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Far as breakfast diners go this is my favorite! I love this place!! I have been to them all over including the original in Shasta, CA. 
It beats the heck out of other breakfast diners!"}
{"text":"I went for breakfast and the service was fast and the server was very nice. 

It was very peaceful inside and wasn't very busy but everybody looked happy, even the employee's.

I am going to speculate that it was the manager or owner because he was wearing a white shirt, but this gentleman was walking around the restaurant asking the customers if everything was good and everytime someone would come in the door. He would yell out \"Welcome\" and thank everyone as they would leave.

He was truly getting it out there how happy he was about his customers. 

He was also at the cash registers when the servers were too tied up. It was great teamwork. 

I ordered the Cinnamon Roll French Toast. Wow! Lots of sugar on this..and usually I have a sweet tooth but way to early for this lol. It was really good though. I ordered some Sausage Links with the ordered but I didn't like the meat to much. I finished my whole plate though and I would love to go back to try something else :)

As you exit, on the door has the yelp logo, so wear it proud Black Bear Diner. Well deserved!"}
{"text":"New location near the outlets - food was excellent, staff friendly and efficient and the place is spotlessly clean! We sat at the counter and the server Enat was great.  It was quick but not rushed.. very happy to have this new location near my house.:) Will be back and definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I walked into this Black Bear Diner and ordered a to-go breakfast, after waited for 20 minutes asked the girl where is my order? she replied it's been ordered, after 30 minutes, I asked her again, she went talked to a manager this time, the manager came to me said, we are very busy you have to wait little while  longer..after 40 minutes, I asked money back and left without my food and very upset..no apology either. What a terrible experience I had there."}
{"text":"We love Black Bear, and this is the first time we've been to the Dysart location. It won't be the last time  Kelly is AWESOME!  Seriously, the girl is a rock star!"}
{"text":"I woke up one Saturday morning craving pancakes. My roommate who used to live in Arizona (and therefore no stranger to the Black Bear chain) remembered this place had just opened near the mall.

We got there around 11:30 a.m. and was quoted a 20 minute wait for two people. We waited on a bench outside for about 10 minutes before a couple large tables were seated and we could move to a bench inside. We were led to our table maybe five minutes after that.

Pros:
The portions were ENORMOUS - I almost made the mistake of ordering three pancakes. Two of those plate-sized babies were more than enough, before the side of eggs, toast, and potatoes I ordered separately.

The food was delicious and hit the breakfast/brunch spot on the nose. No surprises, no exotic touches, just good old-fashioned diner food done right. The pancakes were fluffy, potatoes were crispy, and the eggs a perfect sunny-side up. I honestly can't think of a single complaint.

Cons:
None. The food was fantastic, the service flawless, and the wait for brunch on a Saturday extremely manageable. I'll be back the next time (and every time) I have a craving for an unreasonably large stack of delicious, fluffy chocolate chip pancakes, or every other week!"}
{"text":"We are very happy that they finally got a Black Bear diner on the Strip.  This one is conveniently located in a LV blvd Outlet Mall. The food was great.  I got a 2 egg combo plate and my wife got the scramble.  We added the Black Bear habanero sauce to our eggs and that was a great addition.  Our server Abel was super attentive and stayed on top of our food/drinks even tho the restaurant was super busy.  Good times.."}
{"text":"GREAT place, the food was awesome, right size portions. Awesome customer service and prompt service. Music selection was great."}
{"text":"I brought my husband here for Father's Day today and it was also our first time. I gave it 3 stars because it was super busy (to be expected), the food was decent, and the service was okay. I would come back when it's not as busy to see if the experience is 5 star worthy"}
{"text":"I have came here with my sister for the first time we where curious since we drive past it all the time . It was absolutely so good the server was awesome and welcomed us to the establishment .explained to us the menu and gave us some great pointers I of course took her recommendation and ate a delicious sandwich . Took half of it to my husband and he loved it than I went ahead and took my mom there and she was surprised at how much food she was given she said it was so much so she took some of it home . The hot sauces are amazing .. Specially papa bear ."}
{"text":"Our first time there tonight. Needed a place open after 9. This is a franchise place with \"home\" style food. Burgers, steaks, sandwiches, etc.

We had the all-you-can-eat fish and chips and a breaded chicken cutlet. 

They use Pollock instead of cod for their all you can eat. The first 3 pieces were dry and curled up. The extra 2 were tender and flaky. They didn't look like the same cuts. I should have had the regular version with cod. The fries, slaw and hush puppies were ok. 

My wife's chicken was alright. She really liked the side salad. 

We passed on dessert. 

Total for 2 dinners, no drinks or dessert was about $28 plus tip. 

The server was great. Nice personality. Very attentive. 

If we get a jones for this type of food, we'll be back. Its worth the price but I was disappointed with most of the fish and thought when I mentioned how bad the first 3 pieces were, she would she not charged me for them."}
{"text":"They never disappoint! Good home cooking!  Great service every time I'm there. Chicken fried steak is my favorite... My husband always gets their omelets and hasn't found a combo he doesn't like..."}
{"text":"Food very overpriced. People seem to give good rating because ofcthe large portions. After being seated waited ten minutes for someone to take our order. After our order was taken we waited over 45 minutes for our food. Others around us that were receiving their food were complaining that urmt was either cold or flavorless.  Told our food would be out as soon as possible,  we just got up and left. Would never return to any of their locations"}
{"text":"We ventured out early saturday morning for a treat of breakfast which we have not done for a while other than Fausto's around corner from house. We decided to try Black Bear Diner in Henderson. It was not too busy yet as we arrived and were seated right away. I ordered my morning Diet Pepsi and Josie had coffee. Drinks brought out right away and order was taken promptly thereafter. My soda got low and a second was brought right away. (Yay Soda). Now here is why 3 stars. As I stated it was not particularly busy or full, so having to wait for food was perplexing. We were told after about 15 min that our food should be up in a few. about 5-8 minutes go by and we are still waiting. No food in the pass as we look at kitchen. One waitress then another start asking kitchen for food. One waitress said its been 40 minutes. Wow! upon hearing this the couple one table over stood up and left no order ever taken. We finally got our food after 35 minute wait. They said the printer was not printing the food orders. Down side to computerized order taking. 

I have only worked in a few kitchens but as a cook if I do not see orders printing but can see guests coming in I would wonder what was up. 

Food finally arrived. I had chicken fried steak that was neither great nor bad just average. Eggs and hashbrowns. Hashbrowns undercooked. I'm sure due to rushing them off grill because food was behind. Wife had Pancakes and bacon. Again nothing stood out bad or good. 

Not sure I will go back due to nothing standing out. May try dinner sometime. 

No offer for beverages taken off or a discount for inconvenience just a chuckle type joke from the manager taking tickets at register. 

If you are Hungry and want a big meal check it out. Make sure food ticket machine working though."}
{"text":"Finally visited Black bear diner, one of the very few sit down restaurants in Laveen. Our party of 4 visited around 10am on a weekday and had to wait a few minutes to be seated because there was no hostess. There were actually 3 groups waiting to be seated and with lots of empty tables it didn't make for a great first impression but fear not, the food is great! Our waitress was lovely, I don't recall her name but she was attentive, able to answer questions about the menu items and was available whenever we needed anything, very personable overall. The service was great and the food was also great! Big portions of everything especially the pancakes and omelettes. I will say, they did not cook my eggs scrambled soft (they were dry and overcooked to my liking)  but hey, everything else was delicious. Definitely will be back again. Our group really enjoyed it. P.S Not also that if you're watching your diet you can substitute tomatoes or fruit side instead of potatoes, always helpful."}
{"text":"From Cali & came to Vegas just to check this spot out & OMG omg they need one of theses in LA!!!"}
{"text":"Two stars because the food was and is alwasy good, but the service was lacking. Waiter did not bring items in a timely manner, we repeatedly had to ask different staff members to not serve hot beverages and food over my 10 month old daughter. After we concluded our meal we had to physically get up to ask for our check. First we tried the the hostess because we could not fine the server, and said she could not because the server did not close out the ticket.....but then she didn't go find him, I had to get up again to interrupt his conversation once he arrived to ask him for the check.  May visit other location near my office, but most likely will not make it back to this location."}
{"text":"This place has amazing breakfast food and great service.  Very easy going atmosphere.

I used to hit this place up every morning before work.  If the fresh squeezed OJ machine is working then definitely get a glass.  But alas I don't work too close to this  place anymore.  Luckily, a met a friend for lunch there and it reminded me of the breakfast."}
{"text":"The food, atmosphere and service were all 5 stars! I could easily come here for breakfast, lunch and dinner..... Yum!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go friendly staff good fresh food. Busy place but well staffed a and great teamwork to keep everything going smooth."}
{"text":"On each of our visits, we request April as our server. On top of the food being terrific, her service is #1.

Pot roast is tender and better than home made. 

My only suggestion would be to dump the Pepsi fountain for CocaCola."}
{"text":"An $8 Uber ride off the Vegas strip and you can find yourself amongst locals and Black Bear Diner, a local chain server diner food. We went here for breakfast and to start off my friend's birthday. I had a waffle and hot chocolate. Great choice on both. The waffle was soft and warn. The hot chocolate was made with milk and had a pile of whipped cream on top that I'm a fan of. Best of all, they brought out a little ice cream and sang to my friend for her birthday. It's the little things. Food is really a 4, but since the customer service was so cheerful, I'm bumping them up to a 5."}
{"text":"Wonderful home cooked food and very friendly service! Told them it was my friends birthday and they brought pie and sang! It was decorated so cute with all the bear decorations! Very fun and nice environment and will be back to eat!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love going to Black Bear for special occasions. 
The service is always courteous and professional, the food is always delicious and fresh. The portion sizes are larger than normal and the orange juice and bear claws are a special treat.

We highly recommend Black Bear to friends and family.....can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I've been the the black bear Diner in Gilbert so I was excited when this location opened in Tempe. A friend and I went after work for dinner. It wasn't busy so it was nice to have the place to ourselves. The staff was friendly and attentive. The menu has a huge selection of breakfast, lunch, and dinner items. I had the chicken fried steak breakfast. The biscuit that came with it was huge. The chicken fried steak was a really good portion and tasted wonderful. 

I will definitely be back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"After arriving at Vegas at 7am, we wanted to find a place to eat breakfast. The reviews indicated that we would not be disappointed and I wasn't.  The plates were big and the food was good.  I had the waffles, which were a little soggy, but was still delicious. The only complaint that I had was that the service was a little slow. Got my coffee but no half & half and took a long time getting back to the table, so I grabbed the ones from the table next to ours."}
{"text":"First of all, when we walked in we were greeted bY the front desk. We were told the wait would be 10-15 minutes. Looked around and no one was waiting ahead of us. The restaurant, from our view near the front door, seemed pretty empty. Initial thought was that the kitchen was having a tough time keeping up with the food demands. We were seated right around the 15 minute mark. By this time my kids are already complaining that they are starving. The restaurant is very clean and doesn't look chaotic whatsoever. Anyway, we sit down in a bench table near the back of the restaurant. Colette was our waitress. First thing she did when she saw us is let us know she'd be right back for our drink order. We had enough time between that moment and when she comes back, to figure out what we are all eating for lunch. Despite the wait, She was very friendly, engaging, and attentive. She let us know We have wonderful, polite children and I think of how many times that goes unnoticed and how nice it is to hear. It takes a good 20-25 min for our food to come out. Hearing my kids pleas for food makes me kind of upset that we didn't just stop for fast food like they had asked earlier on.  My husband I just crossed our fingers and hoped that the food would be worth it. The food was good. Definitely not the best I've ever had, but it was good. Definitely didn't warrant an hour wait from start to food on the table. It did taste fresh and like it had just finished cooking. Collette did apologize profusely for the wait, which I appreciated because that doesn't happen everywhere. So, if you are looking for a quick meal, I wouldn't recommend this place. If you are looking for the most amazing meal ever, I wouldn't recommend this place. If you are looking for a home style cafe with friendly waitstaff, give it a shot."}
{"text":"I frequent this place a couple times a month. The staff and management is always very kind. The food is delicious. I have ordered both breakfast and lunch  items. I order the California Omelette for breakfast and the Turkey Cranberry Sandwich if I am getting lunch. If you are a fan of onion rings I get a mix of onion rings and french fries with my meal. The ranch dressing they serve is also heavenly. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because I wish the offered an option for you to order smaller portions."}
{"text":"I love Black Bear Diner. There aren't any locations where I live so I always make I point to stop and dine at one when I see one. We were pleasantly greeted at the door, and seated right away. I was surprised that it wasn't busier for a Saturday morning. 

Drink orders were taken and brought by the worker that greeted us by the door. The waitress took the order. I ordered the fiesta scramble minus the olives. I was glad that they allowed customization. It took about 15 minutes from ordering to when the food arrived. That was pretty good. The orders were exact, and not one trace of olives. Yay! The waitress came by about 3 minutes after the food was dropped off to see how everything was. That was the last we saw of her. Hence the one star deduction. Every time we needed drink refills, hot sauce, napkins, etc. we flagged down the friendly greeter from earlier who was more than happy to oblige. He was top notch and made our experience at Black Bear awesome. I believe his name is Chris, tall guy. 

As for the fiesta scramble, it was very good. The eggs were fluffy, and the country potatoes were flavorful. I liked that they served the meal with warm tortillas. I highly recommend this dish."}
{"text":"Great Food, but very slow service. Been there twice. Will try it one more time, only because the food is so Good."}
{"text":"The service here is awful we waited over 35 mins and still was not seated. It was only for 2 people the  5 parties in front of us had more than 6 1 even was for 10 and I watched as 2 guys walked in and were seated in a booth with out even waiting. When told the waitress she said they went to the counter but I looking at them right in a booth. Some bullshit"}
{"text":"Eat here every time I am in Vegas. This time the place was a mess. The manager was running around like she was lost.  Customers were complaining she didn't take their order and she went and got someone from the back to help them and promptly parked a running vacuum by my table for over 5 minutes unattended.  Screen shot of the video attached. Worst ever experience at Black Bear and moved them from my go to to my avoid them list.  Restroom had no towels either."}
{"text":"It was my first time at this particular location. I've visited the Porterville, Ca location many of times. Black Bear is a great restaurant, with great staff and excellent food. I never have complaints with this restaurant. Love it and will keep coming back. Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"I've been told many times that I needed to try this place and finally did recently. We had a large group (9 of us) on sunday for breakfast and they were able to accomodate us quickly and without issue. I ordered the corned beef hash partly because they said it was homemade. It was absolutely homemade and delicious! They also made substitutions for me without hesitation. The kids in our party all ordered pancakes and french toast and loved them. I took a taste of the cinnamon roll french toast and just loved it! I was very surprised at the Black Bear Diner! I'll be going back for dinner sometime soon."}
{"text":"I would TOTALLY come back. This place reminds me of grandma's log cabin in Mammoth with the Bear theme, carved bear statues, and a variation of bear decor like stuffed bears, and other bear-y memorabilia. You're either into bears, or you're not, which, I am. ANYWAYS. We called ahead on Monday morning for a party of eight, which they accepted and gave us a wait time of 15 minutes. Super friendly, prompt, and polite service upon arrival. 

Food: Everyone HAS to try the California Bacon - Black Bear Benedict.  I got this with my \"extra crispy\" hash browns and side of fruit. The poached egg was sliiiightly too cooked for my preference, but the Hollandaise sauce tasted AMAZING! Like, I'd go there and re-order it  type of amazing. And, although I didn't order it, my friends got some kind of Breakfast scramble that came with biscuit and gravies and that looked equally as delish. Oh, and, the portions are pretty hefty. 

Come here if you're in the mood for comfort food breakfast stuffs and want to avoid the long insane wait times at Hash House. My coffee cup was never empty and the food arrived in all its perfection. 

YUM."}
{"text":"I can't rave enough about this restaurant. Everyone is upbeat & friendly. Our server Nichole was the Best. Food came fast & Never had to ask for anything, like she Knew what we needed when we needed it. The Huge portions are 2nd to none at a very low price. A Must!"}
{"text":"My Veggie Omelette with added ham and bacon was perfection!! Kenie our server was wonderful and so sweet!!"}
{"text":"Yummy comfort food. Huge portions, not a lot of healthy options though. The chicken fried steak is great as is the burger and sourdough melt. They have awesome dessert options. Pie, oh pie!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice.

the first night I came, I was by myself, and STARVING. 

I was seated right away, and then sat there for 15 minutes with NO ONE approaching me to even offer me water.
Now...the restaurant was busy, but you should never be THAT busy that someone can't come over and offer water. 
I left.

I went back one night with my best friend.  Neither of us felt like cooking, so we stopped in.  Again, we were seated right away, and waited for about 10 minutes before we were given water and had our orders taken.  We almost left again.  10 minutes is too long to wait, even in a busy restaurant. 

The chili was good.  That was really the only stellar part of my meal. 
I ordered a burger, and I honestly could have cooked a better one at home.  

For having mediocre food, and LOUSY service, I don't think that I will EVER go back again."}
{"text":"The staff needs training to work together effectively. The food took way to long and very poor quality. The napkins are cute."}
{"text":"Hate to do this but here lately the portions have gotten smaller and the food is just okay. I loved going to Black Bear and was excited to get one in Laveen. Now I don't like to go there very often. Not sure what happened hope it gets better soon. I really loved going to Black Bear in Goodyear and Gilbert.  Need to up your game in Laveen."}
{"text":"We originally went to this place because it was recommended by the folks at the hotel where we stayed and I can say that we were very much pleasantly surprised at how it it was.  So much so that we came back the next day for dinner before we left town.  The pot roast was delicious and we topped it off with their generous helping of Bread pudding for dessert.  The waitresses were very friendly and accommodating.  The meat loaf was the best I've ever had at any restaurant but not as good as the pot roast which I highly recommend.  I will certainly be back and check out their other locations throughout California."}
{"text":"Seriously good comfort food. Similar to Cracker Barrel but better on every level. Love the chicken fried steaks and the bread pudding is outstanding."}
{"text":"Here with Andrew Jason  , Luiz Marzullo and his friend.
Food is always great and excellent service."}
{"text":"I am so blessed! I want everyone in Vegas to please go to the Black Bear Diner and support this business! Not only because the food they serve is incredible, but because the staff they have is even more incredible! This morning I visited for the second time with my 9 year old son who has Cerebral Palsy. We went in to eat before getting him to school after a dentist appointment. There is an amazing human being that waitresses there. Her name is Beatrice. She saw Dom and just like I have seen in countless posts on Facebook, she did something that made me cry! She told me she had a daughter who was in a wheelchair just like my son and she passed away 5 years ago. She also told me my son, Dominic, reminded her of her angel. She told me she was taking care of our bill and the only thing she asked in return was if she could give Dom a hug. I couldn't stop crying. So thank you so much Beatrice and your angel girl! You are so amazing! Please go and show Beatrice some love! Black Bear Diner on Green Valley Pwy!  I will never forget your kindness today!! Never!!"}
{"text":"We come here quite frequently, especially now that we have a little one (great if you have kids).  We've had meals here at breakfast, lunch and dinner, and I haven't ever been disappointed in anything I've ordered.  

Now with a small family, we usually do come here for breakfast - portions are big, and prices are right.  I usually get the bacon and eggs, their sausage is good too (link or homemade patty sausage), and the kids menu has a good selection.  It does get a little busy for breakfast, so I would recommend coming early.  For lunch and dinner, I've never had to wait very long."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. Food was very good for diner food. My wife said she would definitely come back. They messed up my drink order but other than that it was a good meal. Also the food arrived very fast for being as busy as they were."}
{"text":"Wife and i were very disappointed. The waitress super friendly. Food came out very quickly. The Orange Juice is fresh squeezed and was great. That was the good...now for the reason for the 2 star rating...
The pancakes were really doughy, the sausage had a wierd mushy texture, the eggs were way over cooked. Id heard good things about this place but its barely a notch above Dennys (which in my opinion is not very good). We wont be back"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place and will make it my new favorite.  Super cute with the beat stuff all over but not over done.  Price is great for what you get and portions are definitely big enough.  I had the eggs Benedict and it was the best I've ever had.  Will be going again and again."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Took forever for food to arrive. Cant take orders. Never asks any questions. Raw food."}
{"text":"I like this chain.  Big portions and the service is usually good.  

Definitely a good bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Give me 4 slices of thick -sliced bacon, actually cook my eggs over medium like I ask and have butter coverage all over my toast, you get 4 stars! Really Simple...

Nah seriously, this is a good breakfast, solid contender. You can get Hash-browns or Home Fries. The Home Fries are always my first choice anywhere and here they get topped with this onion-pepper mixture after -cooking which I am not a big fan of though. So, I ask them to leave it off and then request the potatoes be cooked crisply- about half the time does it come out right, but that is OK, when it actually gets done it makes it a 5 star awesome breakfast!

Took my brother and his family to breakfast and they really liked it. My brother got a 'Joe Bear Scramble' which he liked and was plated so appealingly, the lady at the table next to us saw his and ordered this for herself. SIL got the HUGE Chicken Fried Steak and really liked it, she is finicky so this is good. 7YO Nephew got the Cinnamon Roll French Toast (4 pcs) which he liked. But, we had to order him a side of bacon because it does not come with any meat. Hard to justify $10 plus breakfast for a 7year old but oh well, I stole a bacon leaving him 3 pieces which he gobbled up! Suggestion, half the order and add bacon as another option, the pieces are large enough to make this a solid plate for women or kids.

The interior is on old Denny's and needs to be refreshed soon and parking can get tricky after 9:30am on a Sunday.

So, if you are in town for NASCAR or Spring Training at Goodyear Ballpark, this location is right off I-10 (Southwest side). Go here or to Mimi's (Northwest side)) for breakfast, but please, stay in Goodyear and keep businesses thriving so I have a job. Thanks :)

To get 5 stars I would say ramp up the home fries a bit, they are missing something but I can't quite put my finger on it, maybe use fresh onion without the bell-peppers (their \"mix\" seems to be pre-made frozen prepped kind) and cook with the potatoes to caramelize versus heaping them on after in a wet mess? Dunno, but probably.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Black Bear is my wife and I's favorite place for breakfast. I guarantee the sweet cream pancakes and waffles are the best in town. Also try the homemade breakfast sausage patties...really good!

Also, they serve fresh squeezed orange juice which is a plus. Service is always good."}
{"text":"We stopped here when we arrived in Las Vegas at the end of July for a late lunch.  We were looking for something \"local\" and wanted to avoid chains as best we could.  Black Bear has more than one location (as we found out later), but I wouldn't consider it a chain.  There were five of us in our party, 4 adults and one teenager.  We were greeted and seated at a round table near a window.  Bobb (yes, with two Bs), was our server and he immediately took our drink order.  While he was getting our drinks, another server asked if we were taken care of, which was nice.  Bobb brought our drinks, and asked where we were from and about our trip, giving us some tips along the way.  We ordered our food.  Some of us ordered breakfast and the rest lunch items. I ordered their Chicken and Waffles, which was very good.  Everything came out excellent and the portions are huge, so bring a big appetite.  Bobb popped by now and then chatting about our meal or just in general.  He kept trying to get us to order dessert, but we were all very satisfied and stuffed from our meal.  We chatted with Bobb one last time before we left (handing the tip to him personally) to go pay for our meal at the front counter.  We thanked him for a pleasant first experience on our first trip to Las Vegas.  If you are in Las Vegas area, I would highly recommend a meal at the Black Bear (and sitting in Bobb's section).  The restaurant and bathrooms are clean, and you get a reasonably priced, big portioned meal that is excellent.  Great service from everyone from the hostess and waitstaff, to the cashier at the counter.  What's better than that?"}
{"text":"Staff was great, food was so so, nothing great. Menus were sticky, floor was sticky. I try to only eat at places that offer me something I cannot make at home myself (and better). There is nothing special or stand out on the menu. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I got to this restaurant 25 to 30 minutes from my home, and realized I had left my house without my purse. I have Apple Pay on my phone but their computers had not been updated, so I had to go back home and come back again. Since I did not want the bad karma of not making this return trip, I did so. I am now back home with my chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes and gravy, green beans, salad and cornbread. Delicious!!! They actually waited for me to return to cook the steak so everything was still warm when I got home. I will definitely be a return customer!"}
{"text":"This is a great kid friendly and family friendly restaurant.  The wait (even when there's a crowd) is never crazy long.  At first, the prices might come across as high, but when you receive your large portion of food, you will soon come to realize that you are getting more than you are paying for.  When I typically come, I usually get either their pancakes or waffles.  Both of these are made with sweet cream instead of milk or water, which makes for a very fluffy breakfast dish.  My brother typically orders an omelet which he is never disappointed with.  However, during this visit, I decided to order their diner basket which was their cheeseburger, fries and a cookie n' creams milk shake.  The burger patty was cooked all the way through but still juicy, so no worries there.  The fries were cooked nicely and their milk shake was amazing.  I really love when a restaurant serves a shake and it's tin.  It makes you feel that your getting your moneys worth.  Overall, this is a good restaurant and I suggest you check it out."}
{"text":"Very nice people working here, Ben here lots of times and never had bad service, the only problem I have is I can never finish all the good food they serve me"}
{"text":"Love this place. We came here for breakfast and I ordered the chicken Apple sausage with potatoes and two hard boiled eggs. It was sooooo good well seasoned both potatoes and sausage. They give you more than enough too! Babe got the sweet cream pancakes and bacon. They were so fluffy melt in your mouth even before the syrup. Most definitely going to have to try this place again."}
{"text":"Very simple menu, very busy and basic American food. The breakfast menu is the best part, lunch and the atmosphere could be better."}
{"text":"I am not gonna lie...I usually never get emotional about food...but I seriously felt like crying because my food was so fricken good!!

First off from the outside you would never think anything of this place...if you were just driving by it looks like a plain diner...BUT the minute you walk inside it has a warm woodsy homey type of feel! The decor is bear and woods themed! It's so adorable! It was very busy which is always a good sign! We were greeted very warmly when we checked in. The wait was only about 15 minutes.

We were seated by the manager Don who started the experience so positively! We had some friendly chit chat and he really does a fantastic job and making you feel VERY welcome!!

We were served by Anthony who did a fantastic job with our whole dining experience!! Also just so genuinely friendly!!

Now most importantly...the food. Let me just say breakfast is my absolute favorite and this place will NOT disappoint!! Everything about what everyone ordered was so on point and flippin' DELICIOUS!!! I had the Bear's Choice, in which I chose 2 scrambled eggs, 1 sweet cream waffle extra cripsy, bacon, and a side order of hash browns. Lawwwwwwwd have mercy it was the BEST tasting batter I have EVER eaten EVERRRR!! My hats off to the chefs in the back who our entire meal beyond perfect!! 

I am so grateful I got a chance to eat here and I am so excited to eat there again!!!(Probably go back later today and tomorrow...lol) I told my friends if I could give a restaurant a hug they would totally get one from me!!

If you are in Las Vegas I HIGHLY recommend trying Black Bear Diner !!! If you love breakfast GO THERE!!!"}
{"text":"Busy Veteran's Day with a lot of people going out for breakfast. My girl and I were seated right away by a friendly hostess. Our waitress was quick, friendly and accommodating. My girl got chocolate chip pancakes and they were awesome (I took a few bites). Black Bear Diner owns the recipe to the best pancake batter out there today. I ordered the bread pudding a la mode and it was warm, fluffy and delicious!"}
{"text":"Great location, A Plus service, delicious food and a great ambience make Black Bear one of my favorite restaurants. They're menu is all day and has a long list of number one hits. For breakfast, you can't go wrong with their pancakes, cinnamon roll French Toast or their Volcano specialty. Pancakes are the best here without question! For lunch and dinner, their burgers, spaghetti and meatloaf are must get. My favorite dessert is Olga's Bread Pudding, although the gluten free lava cake is an extremely close second. Come! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Been a while since I reviewed this location. Been here a lot of times since my first review. Love this place! Staff is efficient and friendly, atmosphere is great and food is as good as it gets. Black Bear makes the best pancakes, cinnamon roll French Toast, onion rings, lava cake and bread pudding. Location is convenient, too."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast, lunch, dinner and desserts. The omelettes are great. My favorite items here are: The Volcano, Chocolate Chip Pancakes, Cinnamon Roll French Toast, Chicken Parmigiana, Onion Rings and chicken tenders. For dessert, Olga's bread pudding ala mode  is the way to go. When I'm in the mood for chocolate, I order the the melt in your mouth lava cake. Service is always excellent."}
{"text":"The food is inexpensive and really good, not to mention the size of their portions. The black bear theme all over the place is a plus."}
{"text":"Well I was all psyched up to come here from out of town and come to this place since it was one of the highest rated breakfast joints to go to in Vegas.  

Things got off to a rough start when we had to wait 30 minutes to be seated on a Monday morning, however I'll take in consideration it was a holiday weekend that was just finishing up. When we finally got seated, it took the waitress almost 20 minutes to take our order. Before that, she had apologized profusely to let us know that they were short-staffed and that there were six other people ahead of us before she would even be able to take our order. About another 40 minutes later, we finally got our breakfast and my order was messed up. I ordered the biscuits and gravy with sausage I instead got bacon,  I didn't bother letting the waitress know because it would have probably taken another 20 minutes to get some sausage. My husband had ordered white toast and it wasn't until we got our order that we were told they ran out of white toast.  seriously who runs out of white toast for friggin breakfast time? 

 overall id say the food was average. I couldn't really say it was fantastic because we waited so long to eat. There was a couple who sat near us and by the time they got their food their eggs were cold and they got up and just left the Good! Which is crazy to me  because we were all waiting so long to eat anyway."}
{"text":"I've only been to Black Bear once before because they are always so busy and I didn't think it was worth the wait. This time we did breakfast for dinner and waited 25 minutes to be seated. They sat us near some large families and it was pretty noisy. I got the Bear's Choice with pancakes (no butter, which they ignored but it was in a separate cup so no harm done), eggs (scrambled, well done), and bacon. The food was quite good but I still can't justify the wait for that kind of ambiance... I'd rather go to Waffle House next door and get breakfast for dinner where it's a whole lot quicker and quieter!"}
{"text":"Review is a lil late but I'm still getting it in  So a couple years ago this lil diner opened up here in LB up in Signal Hill. My friend has the opportunity to eat here for lunch with a few friends from her job and apparently enjoyed her lunch. Came over that night and told me I have to give this place a try. Well just this past weekend I was visiting in Vegas and one morning was looking for breakfast places. So I turned to Yelp  And what comes up in the search?? This place. So I decided  perfect time to try it. And I'm happy I did! Breakfast was delicious"}
{"text":"Good stuff.  Corned beef hash is real corned beef cooked with potatoes.  Pancakes are awesome.  Chicken fried steak is tasty with good gravy."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast found by accident. Great service, ultraclean, the breakfast choices were endless. Great food. Witnessed a manager inspect steak knives prior to adding to a plate. Everyone was extremely friendly."}

Recently opened in Henderson, with a 2014 visit to the Tropicana location still relatively fresh in my mind, it was entirely at the behest of a friend who quickly responded to a Facebook post looking for breakfast recommendations that the twenty minute drive to North Green Valley Parkway took place and although the decorative cabin décor is nowhere near as comprehensive as the Northwest location Black Bear Diner's recipe for success was otherwise faithfully replicated with competent down-home classics served by a team of smiling servers as ignorable top-40 filled the air overhead.  

Largely unimpressed by the 'traditional' Bear Claw during my prior visit suffice it to say a repeat was not high on my list of things to try, but with my buddy signing up for the Bear Lovers E-Club scoring a free coffee and one of the pastries the warm Huckleberry iteration proved a modest improvement on the cold almond paste, though the doughy lack of lamination and lack of filling in the 'toes' still left much to be desired, particularly for an item dubbed a signature.

Fairing far better than the 'appetizer' it was of two 'Griddle Vittles' that the rest of our breakfast was comprised and although the French Toast was decent but largely forgettable the 'secret recipe' of buttermilk and sweet cream constituting the base of two airy pancakes was worth every cent of the modest $6.49 tab, fake maple syrup aside.

A mere $10 each after tax and tip when taking into account the E-Club discount Black Bear Diner is perfectly fine but having now visited both local locations and trying the pies, pastries, French toast, and pancakes there's really no pressing reason to return, particularly in a city with no lack of local places turning out equal or better food at a similar cost."}

Unbeknownst to me a regional chain with over sixty locations throughout California and parts east an early morning stop at Black Bear Diner was prompted not only by a convenient location and inviting menu, but also by the promise of a 'dinner and a show' - in this case the traveling \"Chainsaws for Change\" crew cleaving blocks of wood into all sorts of shapes while I partook in a four part breakfast...plus a couple items to go.  Kitsch in décor with a pervasive log cabin theme speckled by bears both stuffed and carved it was to the tunes of the Four Tops that I entered Black Bear Diner and greeted first by a host behind the small pastry case and then by my server, Ray, the morning progressed in two courses with countless cups of coffee, the carving action outside visible through the windows while I dined.  Starting sweet and progressing sweeter it was to the flavor of custard-rich, ice cream crowned bread pudding that the meal began and rife with caramel, pecans, and raisins the steamy block proved surprisingly light while a duo of fresh baked breads with whipped butter and honey proved equally well done; the $0.99 cornbread toothsome and buttery while the $2.39 biscuit was so fluffy it literally flaked apart to the tooth.  Working slowly through the trio as wood chips flew it was only after the pudding was polished off that Ray put in my order for round-two and arriving piping hot the quartered cinnamon roll dressed in eggy batter and fried golden was superb, a light drizzle of cream cheese frosting mingling with the surprise of pure maple syrup into pure decadence - the sort of dish best taken with milk or coffee...and perhaps even better, shared.  At this point taking my leave and settling the bill it was with two additional items that I exited the cozy confines of the Black Bear and saving them until hours later suffice it to say that it was with some disappointment that I found the signature bear claw's pastry poorly laminated around pasty nut filling while the requested \"Cinnamon Apple Bavarian Cream Pie\" had been substituted by a standard, albeit delicious, traditional Apple Pie with a glossy butter crust instead - next time I guess I'll just have to enjoy all three courses at the table instead."}
{"text":"If you want something cheap and fast that is still good without looking like it was made on a conveyor belt than this is a great place. The hamburgers are HUGE and oh so good! Friendly staff with fast service."}
{"text":"Have been going here for years and today may have been our last. Worse yet, we took friends and things did not go well.

They had the French dip and I noticed them kind of pushing them around. When I asked, I got the old \"thanks for the suggestion\", worst we've had. Cold, bland and the capper, the man used the men's room and it was filthy. Someone had even moved their bowls in a urinal.  The menu is different as well. Has this place changed owners or something?"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place for breakfast. Sharing a bear claw while waiting for our order.  Always fabulously delicious food."}
{"text":"I'm a New Yorker through and through.  Of course I love diners, real 24 hour diners which have that older, shaggy feel:) and the menu has 'disco fries'.  Yes, I can order it that way, but seeing that on a menu makes it.
Black Bear Diner is a great diner for this side of the country:)  
Unfortunately, it's not Open 24 hours- COME ON!  At least consider the newest location on LV Blvd not far from Blue Diamond to eventually be open 24 hours.  Think about it, once that stadium opens... ;)
The staff at all he Black Bear locations never, ever disappoint.  They are bubbly, you can feel the warmth of their personalities and are they speedy!  I mainly frequent the Sahara/Durango location now. That outdoor waiting are with the bears does have appeal!  However, Mindy the waitress is superb. Last time I finished dining, we hugged.  Seriously, go and be seated in Mindy's area and you will know why she's who she is- wonderful!  All the staff are here, but she's my favorite. Yes, as it it everyone has favorites. 
Food is always great quality ingredients, prepared quickly and arrive in front of you piping hot. I usually order the tuna melt.  Being the NYer I am, I do alter it.  Try it: tuna melt, rye toast, no lettuce, but make sure that cheese is Swiss. I en a provolone would do.  No, step it up and make the change away from cheddar/yellow American cheese please;)
Always order a dessert, nope no favorite. WELL, I do.  Not telling, Simply try them all at once or over various visits!
Eat well!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast place in Vegas!   We were there four mornings this last trip to Vegas.  Great portions.  Steak and eggs like it should be.  The chicken fried steak is to die for.  The pancakes, the best!   Good portions.  Nice people there. The owner remembered us from last year.  That was nice.  No smoking establishment!!  Yay for us non-smokers!   This is the place to go for a good non-buffet breakfast.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Very odd for a breakfast place to surprise me! The prices are great. Large portions and very flavorful food! The sausage and pancake was great! Very kind service, paying takes a while though because the cashier also seats people. The apple sausage isn't good though"}
{"text":"Food and service was great. I wouldn't go anywhere else for breakfast if it's always like this!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience.  Bad food, rude hostess, inaccurate wait times, slow service and overall a waste of money. Take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"What can i say? better than ihop and dennys. just an amazing place to eat any time of day. Amazing environment and very clean."}
{"text":"Always great food and good service. Be ready for a wait but it is worth it. Extremely large portions so be sure to go hungry!"}
{"text":"We eat here often.  The food is American comfort food done very well. Love that they will adjust your meal the way you want it.  Portions are large even the smaller meals are large.  The staff are friendly and attentive.  Beware that weekend brunch usually has a wait as its so popular.  A great addition to the neighborhood. We love eating here."}
{"text":"We were going to an early movie and decided to stop here for lunch, it was getting crowded so we sat at the counter which I love since I'm a retired corp. exec chef and pastry chef I love to watch the staff at rush hour. First of all the place is very clean, and believe me I know. The staff clean and friendly and seem to be very experienced, they were very busy and the kitchen and wait staff really held it togethe really well as I watched them pick up there orders on the line, again believe me I know. Most of the plates I saw were breakfast and they looked great large portions beautiful big biscuits, I ordered the lunch special the prime rib philly cheese steak and debbie ordered the Mediterranean salad both were very good I liked the bread too, everything was hot and fresh. We went for lunch but I'm going back for their breakfast real soon. Believe me I know."}
{"text":"My family that came from Ecuador and I came here for the first time and we LOVED it! The food is delicious and the service is awesome. Friendly staff! They also play amazing music. We will definitely be coming back! Recommend this diner to anyone you will leave with a happy face and a full stomach!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big breakfast eater but when I'm in the mood, I'll drive the 110 city blocks to eat here.  They have great iced tea.  And their green Mama Burn sauce is better than Tabasco."}
{"text":"Best family restaurant in all of ARIZONA. Fabulous food, awesome service,  great atmosphere and super pricing and portions.  Love, love, love Black Bear, it's truly my favorite place to go, breakfast, lunch & dinner and especially homemade desserts!"}
{"text":"We love going to Black Bear. Food is good and prices are fair. 

Black Bear would get 5 stars, but I had to deduct one for the fact that every time we go, we are told it'll be a 20 minute wait for a table - don't think we've ever waited less than 45 minutes. 

Maybe they have done some research and 20 minutes seems to be the best answer to give customers when asked \"How long of a wait?\""}
{"text":"We love eating at the Black Bear Diner.  Our first time our server Tatum was awesome.  She took her time with us explaining how everything was made.  Our food was over the top amazing. We spoke with Chris the manager on duty and he was just a really great gentleman as well.  We have definitely found our go to eatery.  Thank you everyone at Black Bear Diner"}
{"text":"We needed a lunch spot after flying into Vegas and that spot looked nice. I usually don't leave a review unless I really like the place, and this spot didn't disappoint. Definitely seems family friendly and had a fun theme throughout. The food was awesome and I was stuffed when I left. Highly recommend the Machaca Breakfast tacos. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went twice in one week because the food was that good. Breakfast the first time and lunch the second. Sam was our server, she was awesome. The kitchen was out of a few items I had ordered, but she accommodated me well regardless. She was super friendly and checked on us often despite being busy. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Seems like every time I come to this location I always have bad luck in service. This one takes the cake by far. Not sure if our server was having a bad day but it didn't seem that way with her other tables just ours. Guess we don't wear the correct skin color.  I shouldn't have to ask other servers for things especially when you as my server just helped the 4 tables near us and u just walk by us. I work customer service and in a restaurant as a server and I would never treat anyone that way, ever. I'm not looking for a free meal or anything like that, just know that I will no longer bring my business here to this location."}
{"text":"Love this place, from the food to all of the staff including the management team here. Food is always delicious and staff is always happy and friendly. We are always taken care of like family here. We will always come back many more times."}
{"text":"I had heard amazing reviews about this place. I finally had the chance to go. Sadly I was hugely disappointed. Maybe I made the mistake of ordering lunch. The food was bland, my fries were burnt and tasted of dirty oil. $4 for a garden salad gets you iceberg lettuce and a few carrots. Not what I expected at all for a side salad of that price.  Our waitress had a great smile but was forgetful with it being very slow.  I don't think I will come back. It wasn't worth the price nor the time."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday morning at around 9:45am and the place was packed! We had a 15-minute wait before they were able to sit us the three of us down, but it gave us some time to check out the branded goods the diner sells (look for the mini-bottle of honey!). I didn't have too much of an appetite, so ordered off the Little Less menu that the restaurant states provides \"Smaller portions of our same great comfort food. Perfect for seniors or those with a lighter appetite.\" However, the ham & cheese omelette seemed like a full-on meal with the omelette, hash browns, and bowl of fruit! It was a great deal for $7.99 and I wonder if perhaps it's just a way to give senior citizens a discount. Good job, Black Bear Diner!

A couple folks had their birthdays and the birthday dessert looked great even for a morning meal. Only hiccup was that the waiter stated watermelon was included into the fruit bowl, but it only included grapes, cantaloupe, honeydew, and strawberries. Food is super affordable for what you are getting. This is a great joint in Henderson and is recommended!"}
{"text":"Just went to Black Bear Dinner and had Abel as our waiter for the second time and he was great! Definitely recommend him for employee of the month. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Great place for steak and eggs, stepson loves it."}
{"text":"Others have told us that this is THE place for breakfast in the west valley. After trying several times to get in - there is ALWAYS a line - we finally had a short wait and were seated (our first time). All in all, the food was good though not overly exceptional. The service and speed, however, were great. The food was a tad pricey but only a touch. A good experience but no way would it be worth any extended waiting period.

5-10 minutes? Go for it. More than that, pass."}
{"text":"You definitely want to stop here for breakfast!  We were on our way out of Vegas and wanted to eat breakfast away from the strip. Glad we found this restaurant.  Breakfast was delicious.  Portions are large. Friendly, quick service.  Cute bear decorations are sure to get you to snap a few pictures."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.big selection,large servings.the service. is excellent .no problems.go there 2. To 3 times a month.tropicana and jones."}
{"text":"Yesterday I had breakfast here with a friend, and really enjoyed the experience.  The restaurant itself has a very rustic feel - not very Las Vegas; think more along the lines of Colorado or even somewhere in the Midwest.  Very cool if you're looking for a place that isn't going to be full of tourists, or alcohol.  (Again, very non-Vegas.)  But that's part of its draw.

We went during off hours, so that's probably why it was mostly empty when we went.  We had a courteous server who checked on us often, making sure we had everything we needed and wanted.  And the food - ahhhh, the food.  I got the harvest pancakes with strawberries on top.  Wow.  So good!

The only thing keeping this place from a five-star rating - at least for me - is that there weren't many vegetarian options.  That being said, those pancakes are worth coming back for!  I'll be back here again."}
{"text":"Been here twice for breakfast. Mike was our server the first time and Monika was our server yesterday. Both were friendly, helpful and very good at their job. 
The portions and prices are phenomenal. 
The pancakes are delicious (seriously!) and we plan to try different kinds each time we stop in. Its not close to our house, but the food is so good, we dont mind the quick trip on 95 from the northeast side to eat there. The sausage and bacon is tasty and MUCH better than those other breakfast places you might have been to. 
See you next time!"}
{"text":"I have been to one in Bullhead City.  Food here is the same.  EXCELLENT.  If you are not a big eater than share a meal.  Servers were polite and friendly.  Great food and menu."}
{"text":"Yes. Yes. and YES this place is pretty darn awesome.

As a country\chicken fried steak connoisseur, I must mention that everything you may have heard is true - they DO have great chicken fried steak. Every bite is worth EVERY calorie. Eachtime I've come here in the past year (I'd say over 10 times), I tell myself that I will try something else on the menu. Um, I haven't - I CAN'T!!! I feel ordering something else will deprive me of the opportunity to enjoy one of my favorite breakfasts.
My husband especially loves that they have a \"Hungry Bear's Breakfast\" section - he hates it when he can't get a big breakfast! Even though the chicken fried steak (big foot version - of course) is his all time favorite, he loves The Grizz too.
All the food is hot and fresh --but most importantly - consistent!!! That's a biggie.

I love the owner\host guy that is there every time we walk in and seats us. He is the cutest old guy in the world. Every time we come in he gives us the warmest welcome and has this adorable smiling face. I keep telling my husband - I swear I just want to give that guy a hug.

The wait staff seems to have been working there forever.. They know everything on that menu front and back. The service is always top notch. 

We haven't been there for any other time except breakfast but we have been meaning to and probably will in the near future. I would recommend signing up for their loyalty program - you get great deals via email that are hard to pass up.

Definitely recommend this place!!! It's worth a drive to check it out!"}
{"text":"This location has been open a little over a week. They had no idea what they were doing from the hostess to the cooks in the kitchen. Everything was disorganized! Our server made the two hour wait a little less horrible by greeting us pleasantly. Overall it took nearly four hours at this restaurant and it was not worth the wait. Waiters were yelling at each other and the cooks were yelling back too. It was an awful experience. But, this place needs a lot of work. Id recommend to retrain the staff before you decide to have patrons inside your restaurant. This being their second location you'd assume this isn't their first rodeo, but apparently it is."}
{"text":"Went in yesterday for a late breakfast. They seem to still be working some of the kinks out as they had a bunch of empty tables and people sitting around the lobby waiting to be seated. Food was really good, which is normal for Black Bear as was the service though it seemed to take quite awhile for the food to come out. Cashing out was also a bit of a mess but apparently they were having technical difficulties there as well. Once the bugs are worked out, I'm sure this place will be fine."}
{"text":"I'm glad Black Bear Diner is in Green Valley now! We were definitely missing a decent diner-style place for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. This location is spacious and clean. The service is friendly. There's a great variety on the menu and anything I've ever tried from Black Bear Diner has been delicious. Certainly nothing fancy, but reliably hearty portions (with smaller ones available) and good food. And you gotta love the bear theme - too cute."}
{"text":"TWO STARS 
OK this is the second weekend they have been open, so I guess gotta give a few alibis.  Service is extremely slow, 40-mins FIFA burger. The couple next to me had to leave as their lunch time expired, without even getting to eat. I am sure service will improve. 

The location is fine, they should get a lot of business. 

Time will tell if they can turn their poor service around. 
 
12-17-16 Update
FOUR STARS
Second visit and service was as expected. Fast and friendly with good food. Attentive wait staff. 

They need to figure out how to separate customers wanting to be seated from those paying their bill. NO easily recognizable method for the customer walking in the door. They have to get in line with the customers paying if there is a large number of customers standing in line."}
{"text":"My first experience with this diner chain was in Colorado Springs.  Both locations are top notch and deliver the home cooked meals I crave from someone's else cooking. Nice find in Chandler."}
{"text":"I'll start off with that the pie actually pretty good.
I believe that sometimes first impressions can be deceiving. But I've been there twice, each time we waited 10 minutes for someone to come to our table.
The first time it was busy, so I could understand from my experience working in a restaurant. Second time wasn't so busy and we still waited.
But whatever, I can handle waiting at first.

One of us ordered a lemonade, and before he even drank half of it, it spilled on the table. The waited didn't ask if he wanted another, and after his glass had been empty almost the entire meal and he asked for another, she said that she'd have to charge for another.

In both our experiences working at restaurants, it was always a common courtesy to refill something that is spilled.

We tried to keep an open mind and try again but we've been disappointed each time.

I'm sad to say this but I don't think we'll be returning."}
{"text":"Food is great! Large portions and has all the classic breakfast options you could want. Every plate comes with cornbread or pancakes (toast Is another option i think). The best thing about this place is the employees, they're all super nice and good at their jobs. Really know how to take care of customers. Also they have fresh squeezed OJ!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely my go to for breakfast on weekends. From the breakfast slow roasted taco dish to the eggs benedict there is something for every taste. The pricing is fair for the large portions. The homemade orange juice and the Blackbear hot sauce selection to seal the deal. I love the down to atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Visiting from L A and wanted breakfast. So we talked to the locals and they recommended this spot.  LAWD HAVE MERCY !!! It was amazing. I'm talking about great service and plenty of delicious food. Our waitress Denise was just as sweet as can be and very down to earth. Ihop and Dennys need to step their game up.


Give Denise a raise!!!!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place .. Really good .. Gonna def come here more often ... SHOCKED a lil glass of orange juice is 4.99"}
{"text":"Black Bear is a great smaller chain that has successfully managed to keep their mom-n-pop feel. Great food, great people, you won't be disappointed but probably won't be FLOORED with excitement, either. No regrets, will eat here again."}
{"text":"Although I didn't care for what I ordered, I would give them another try.  They loose points for price also.  My son and I stopped for lunch ...$33, wow!

The atmosphere is like woodsy/folksy and misplaced in the Valley of the Sun.  The poor wait staff have to wear goofy looking suspenders.  The restaurant was comfortable, relaxing and staff were friendly and efficient.  

Bacon Cheeseburger Salad
Salad mix topped with a chopped burger patty, bacon, dill pickle, tomato, red onion, cheddar cheese.  $9.99

My salad was brought to the table in a giant bowl puffed up by tons of lettuce.  The ground beef was just in crumbles and was not seasoned.  The rest was ok, nothing speacial....just a lot of lettuce.

My son and I also shared an order of $6.00 onion rings.  They were o.k.  We could not finish them.  Too many.  Wish there was less and a lower price.

I might try them for breakfast sometime and share whatever we order.  Giant portions never appeal to me.  I find being served an enormous plate of food embarrassing and obnoxious especially when the food is just average."}
{"text":"Me and my husband frequent the Black Bear at least 4-5 times a month. Although all of the food looks good I come for the breakfast. I love good pancakes and the Black Bear has THE BEST pancakes I have ever had and the syrup is to die for also. The staff is always very friendly and my food never disappoints. There is usually a small 10-15 min wait but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I would have liked to say my experience was above that of other estabishments, however, the wait on a Saturday morning was unreal.  Our host did set the expectation for a 25 minutr wait time while the kitchen caught up. Huge flag.  This made me feel that they werr not appropriately staffed.  Then as the lobby began to fill with many familys the story was the same .  If i was waiting 25 minutes just for a seat there was no way that others would wait the same 25 minutes.  Then people who had already been seated began walking out because they wait once the got seated was lo g as well with 1 gentleman proclaiming in the lobby that 2 other familys were served before his family was served and they were there first.  I did not need much more after this.  While it is possible that this estanlishment is fine enough, this was not a great first experience so i went across the street to Crackers where I walked right in ordered my food and got o. With my life.  Maybe ill try another time when i have more than 25 minutes to wait in the lobby."}
{"text":"\"The best corned beef hash I've ever had!\"

Ok, admittedly I've had corned beef hash like only three times, but the Bear knows how to sling it!  Cholla!

My hash came with a moderate portion of scrambled eggs, fresh fruit (instead of papas) and french toast. 

The fresh fruit was a medley of sliced strawberries, pineapple and grapefruit.  Simply delightful! 

The toast looked to me like it was going to be a big disappointment, but it pleased the palate.

And just because I can't turn down fresh squeezed orange juice, I continued my personal crusade against scurvey.

I left quite full, and since that ample feast only cost $15, my wallet left quite full as well"}
{"text":"Did take out and the food was not good. Bun on the burger was soggy and wet. All fries were soggy and gross. Out of three meals only parts of each were okay to eat"}
{"text":"The name of this restaurant makes me hungry!!!  The meals here are fit for a black bear, hehehehe!  The server was nice and quick to take our order.  I had such a yummy breakfast and then had a banana cream pie to go.  Every part of that meal was just heaven.  I wish they had stores in OC.  

I am not sure if I prefer this place or Blueberry Hill?  Why is life so full of tough decisions?"}
{"text":"Came here early morning for breakfast and was greeted immediately by the hostess. My friend and I ordered food and it came out in a timely fashion. The food was delicious. Our hostess continuously checked on us and kept refilling our coffee - which I very much appreciate. I love the fact that the portions are enough to eat and take home. Did I mention delicious? lol Thank you so much. You are my favorite comfort go to  diner in town :)"}
{"text":"My usual Black Bear Diner I go too, I was so craving the chicken and waffles and sadly let down. Dense and darker side chicken, didn't taste right at all.... was sad!"}
{"text":"I love me some breakfast, but given the ability to choose between all the meals of the day is a winner. My friend and I decided to give this place a try after a few unsuccessful attempts. Finally getting out here and looking at the menu, lunch won out. 

I got the tri-tip dip with a green salad. The cuts of meat are thick and generous without being jaw dislocating. With three large slices of perfectly seasoned beef, grilled onions and mushrooms, it was perfect. The vegetables were not drowned in oil and the roll was not soaked through. The tri-tip was cooked to a medium/medium-well. I normally prefer medium rare, so next time I will request it and see if they offer that option. The green salad was standard. My friend got the hobo omelet and you have to be starving to finish it. It is a gigantic monster stuffed and topped with bacon, sausage, ham, spinach, onion, and cheese. The red potato chunks are tender, not too salty, but not crispy. It comes with a bread as well. He got the biscuit. They are big, not dense and light.  Both entrees cost around nine dollars. We were shocked by how generous the portions were for the price and that it tasted good too. I could not finish the meal without getting a blackberry sundae. Even though I was full, I cannot resist the cold stuff especially if it is topped with berries. They give a large scoop of vanilla ice cream topped with warm blackberries. Instead of doing a compote, when heated, the berries release their juices to create a sauce. As the ice cream melts and melds with the fresh fruit and whipped cream, it is heaven. 

This is a nice place to have a relaxing meal. The only thing that is rushed is the food. The kitchen and staff are quick to deliver without making you feel like you have to shove it down and get out."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town!

It has a very country atmosphere to it. Being that the name has to do its Black Bears----the place is decorated wi lots of bears that includes statues, dolls, and toys. 

Some of the most friendly staff that I have had serve me while sting too. The staff all assists you on things such as refills or taking dishes off the table. All smiles and personality!

If I have to recommend one thing to eat/drink, it has to be the Huckleberry ice cream! This is the only place in town that has Huckleberry ice cream and also does fantastic ice cream shakes. It takes just like the huckleberry products that I have come from Idaho. If you come here, you have to try something with Huckleberry in one form or another."}
{"text":"My first time ever to a a Black Bear Diner. I've wanted  to try the one on Tropicana forever, I'm a fan of diner food, it's pretty much what I grew up eating on the East Coast. 
The place was cute, decorated with bears everywhere. The staff was friendly and accommodating. We had a big group show up for lunch and stress that we only had an hour, so don't dilly dally. We were done and out of there on time. This bumped their rating up a star. 
I got the Small Club Sandwich with Chicken Tortilla Soup as my side.  The soup was pretty bad, tasted like can soup that they added additional cans of beans and corn to. The Club was very basic, nothing special. Something you can get anywhere.
My other table mates got the Bacon Cheeseburger Salad which looked huge, everyone seemed to like it. French fries were definitely the frozen kind. French Toast looked pretty basic. The Double Bacon Blast looked a little light on bacon. The Chicken Tender basket looked like chicken tenders from anywhere. Tuna Salad looked small and pretty ordinary.
After this initial visit I really doubt I'd return to Black Bear Diner, the food was too ordinary and I can get this type of food all over town."}
{"text":"First timers at this resto. There was a line but our wait time was about 10-15 minutes. All crew was very nice and professional. Didnt wait long at all for our food. Super large portions at a reasonable price. Chicken Fried steak was off the hook. Ordered the Scrambowl and I was overwhelmed with the amount of potatoes. Food was delish! Our waitress checked up on us frequently OD us with coffee which was awesome! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Walked into this location to a rude Hostess named Michelle, pretty upset the first 5 minutes because I couldn't believe the way she talked to my mom. The only reason we stayed is because of our awesome sever named Jonathan, who gave by far the best experience I've had in a restaurant in years. Food was also excellent, with the breakfast being to die for, and I will be back... But only because of the service Jonathan gave my family and I."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place, food is excellent , service is great. I could eat here daily !"}
{"text":"Very BEARY good.  The pancakes tasty and definitely enough food.  They even have a menu with half sizes.  A must try while visiting  Henderson.  The service was a little lacking, had to ask for more syrup and butter for my pancakes who gives one small butter and syrup for these big pancakes?"}
{"text":"I had the bacon eggs breakfast with sourdough toast.  Every time the food and the staff are awesome!"}
{"text":"Bring your appetite and don't make any plans for the rest of the day.  If you're in the mood for a lazy Sunday, then you have arrived.  The bf and I slept in and arrived around mid day for breakfast.  Many friends had told us to try the Big Bear Chicken Fried Steak, which is no joke.  I've never seen a chicken fried steak this big and gravy drenched outside the borders of Texas. Don't wear skinny jeans to this dance!  We also tried the Big Bear Steak & Eggs, which was a little disappointing because the steak was overcooked and blah."}
{"text":"Im glad they opened one here in Vegas. Been here quite a few times. Service is excellent; staff well trained. Food is very good. Only complaint would be there sometimes run out of items. Prices are cheap too. Meal desert and drink will run you $15 or so. Staff always helpful!"}
{"text":"Family Breakfast at Black Bear Diner today to celebrate the new year. Food came come warm and some cold. We asked our server Catherine for knives to cut our food and she told us they don't have knives. We asked for a manager Jennifer and  said there wasn't any and that she would check in kitchen.  :( 10 minutes later she came back with knives and our food was cold. We also asked our waitress for coffee but they had run out... 15 minutes later we finally had coffee."}
{"text":"Service is a bit slow but the food is good and the amount you get for the price makes up for the longer wait times. Also the wait to get a table has been long but when you are hungry it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Black Bear diner is our go-to Sunday brunch place. When you're looking for a breakfast place that serves really good pancakes/ waffles/ bacon / sausage and omelette this is the place to go. 

Price is worth it for the size of the food you'll get. Their waffles are incredible and they always serve my sunny side up perfectly. I love their hot chocolate and my husband always enjoy their all-meat omelettes. 

Service is fast, some days (esp on weekends) wait could be 20-25 mins but most days you won't need to line up. The place's decoration suites the restaurant's theme and they are able to keep it clean and tidy. 

Always a pleasant and satisfying experience dining here. We'll def be back!"}
{"text":"If it weren't for yelp, I might not have ever tried this place. It's not really close to my house or work, but I ventured here with my parents for a week day breakfast before shopping trip. The service was down-home spectacular, from the hostess, to the waitress and the cashier, all friendly and eager to please. The portions were huge although the food was mixed for me. My Dad ordered the Big foot which was a large chicken fried steak with eggs, potatoes and biscuits. It was wonderful, everything a chicken fried steak should be. I ordered the eggs Benedict and was disappointed by the overcooked egg yolk and the consistency of the hollandaise sauce. This is the only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars."}
{"text":"No, No, No,,,, Just NO... get back in your car and go to Denny's or Waffle House... sorry but this place lacks flavor big time, and the staff seemed like they didn't enjoy their job... I dont give very many 1 stars... but I def wont be back. 

For the Price, BLD, Fist Watch etc are all better, we were looking for a cheap Dennys like price with new options... guess we will stick with Hangar Cafe for a while longer, good luck"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Black Bear Diner, but I had thought of them as California only. So I was delighted to find they're in Nevada too when I was looking for a place to meet someone for dinner.

The woodsy bear kitsch is cheesy, yeah, and so is the newspaper menu. But the food is great, and across many locations I've always gotten solid service. 

Black Bear Diner is best for breakfast and comfort food - basically diner faire, but they're made up a little classier than a greasy spoon diner. This location also seems to have plenty of parking and seating, I went at a reasonably busy hour and there was no wait. 

If I had to pick a favorite, it'd probably actually be the turkey sandwich. Something about it is just perfect, and it comes with some of my favorite French fries too."}
{"text":"The breakfast was delicious, the staff attentive, and atmosphere very very cozy. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I like this place it's down the street from my residence, very convenient for me and my daughter when we are hungry my daughter likes the mini volcano as her dads enjoys The Big Volcano.. they have fast service, and the portions are well enough for leftovers if your not starving lol. My first check in I got a bear paw.. never had one before but when I brought it home and ate it omg it was so good with butter. Mmm."}
{"text":"We were seated for 25 minutes and just utterly ignored by our server. No idea about the food because we never got to order. 

Really unenjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Come here pretty often for breakfast & decided to finally try out their dinner. I had their meatloaf and it was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I come here often with my mom. I never get breakfast unless I cook it myself so I always get an omelet. Ana is the best waitress."}
{"text":"My wife, daughter, and I stopped here for lunch recently. It was busy and we had a 15 minute wait for a table. Service was very good. I has a turkey club sandwich with cold slaw. My wife had a salad. The food was very good and a lot of it for an inexpensive price. I would recommend Black Bear for good service, good food, with reasonable priced menu items."}
{"text":"Today my son and I came in for lunch. Our server Brandon was awesome
 He was really great with his attentiveness. He was extremely friendly and talked a bunch with my 13 yr old son. The food is consistently delicious."}
{"text":"We've been anticipating this opening for a while now. We love Black Bear and heard they where opening a new location just up the road from us. We looked on every corner and empty building, but not until they put the sign up did we know the spot.  It's a great corner, but a little worried about parking. It's a tight spot.

We walked in at dinner time, around 530pm and were met with a wall of smiling faces, all eagerly waiting on customers to show up. The place looked empty, about five tables seated. 

We were shown to a table right away, handed a menu and asked if we'd been to a Black Bear before, 'great, the hostes said, we'll take good care of you here'. Then walked away. 

Our  server shows up and repeats the same message. She's a little awkward and forgets what she is suppose to do, I quickly give her my drink order and my husband did the same. She ran off to get them, leaving us feeling like we where in a foeign land. 

Once she returns, we're ready to order, again a little awkward moment, she takes it and leaves. We figure it's beginners jitters.

My soup arrives, claim showder, it's hot, thick white, a few diced potatoes, and a few clams. It's creamy, has good flavor seasoned. They serve a hot corn bread roll, I quickly slather it with butter, it's melting quickly and I am eager for a bite, but it's a tad bland even with the butter. 

My dinner arrives, I got the big foot chicken fried steak. Wait, it looks different, a crust that is flat, fried to a reddish brown outter shell over a thin piece of beef.  Could this be a frozen patty? Small, not what I'm used to seeing from Black Bear. Did they change their vender? It's served with twice the mashed potaoes smothered in cream gravy and green beans. 

The mashed are made from scratched, they are thick, creamy and pretty good, but the green beans were a bit of a disappointment, despite bits of bacon, they lack seasoning, are bland and without flavor.

My husband orders the big foot breakfast with hash browns, scrambled eggs, a chicken fried steak and toast. It's a good plate, but he agrees, the steak is more a patty than a steak!

Good service, a bit green, but should get better with experience? My dinner a bit bland but decent, will come back for breakfast at least, we've always enjoyed a hearty Black Bear breakfast!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Good hearty food, great service, friendly and quick.  

I'm a breakfast freak, so give me a good size omlete, side of fruit( when I'm being healthy) and some sour dough toast and I'm happy. 

The servers are always smiling amd friendly, the service is always swift, food served hot of the grill, and refills come swift. 

We've been coming here for years and the food is always consistant. Reasonable prices, good location for us!"}
{"text":"Always excellent service. Always.  Great food, large portions, reasonable prices.  However, the poached eggs were overcooked but our server knew how to get me new eggs quick with cooked white and runny yolk.  Thick bacon was not thick, very stingy on the avocado.   Be sure to ask for crispy bacon if that is how you like it. As for potatoes opt for the country-style red potatoes, unless you like chewy dry blackened potatoes then go for the strip-cut hash browns (they are very very generous with the potatoes).  I saw a plate of biscuits and gravy that was huge.  My hubby had chicken fried steak and gravy which was quite yummy.  Definitely eat here and don't be shy about asking for new food if something is not to your liking."}
{"text":"Lots of food even though I had ordered the mini volcano.  Everyone enjoyed their breakfast.  Thanks to Spring, our waitress who had patience as we combed through the menu.  All six of us ordered different items.  There were no complaints.  It got quiet as we all enjoyed.
Go early, long line waiting as we left.  I think this is the usual for a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I never have anything to complain about. The food is great, the staff is great, and the dessert is to die for! 

I took my grandma here a few days ago, and she was absolutely in love with the decoration and how much it felt so country. 

If you haven't done in here, you definitely should!"}
{"text":"The old fashioned burger basket combo was a joke.  The patty was thinner than the tomato.  A piece of bacon would be thicker!  Never even tasted the meat.  Asked me how like it cooked, couldn't be specific on this burger since the second it hits the cooking surface it would be done.  Come on, is this the Wammy Burger from the movie \"Falling Down\"?"}
{"text":"Our hangout lots of great food , good service and good atmosphere. Lots of food at lower prices !"}
{"text":"Delicious! I came by myself and had breakfast on a Wednesday around 8am. The waitresses were very friendly and warm. I hadn't been to black bear diner in a few years so I forgot how big the portions are. I am gonna be coming back and bringing my daughter so she can have the French toast. I ended up ordering the Shasta Scramble and I was so happy with it especially after adding bacon"}
{"text":"Would not go back. Not nasty but not better than cracker barrel. I was hopeful because of the review's but disappointed. French toast had no flavor. NONE! the amount of food for the prices was alot in my opinion (two pieces of normal size french toast, eggs and 2 pieces of bacon for $10). Bacon was not crispy. I didnt even eat it and i love bacon."}
{"text":"Honestly if Yelp allowed the ability for .5 stars this would be a 3.5/5....reason being is price is solid, portions solid, food was okkkkk but better than iHOP and Denny's for sure.

We ordered the:

Country Fried Steak - Didn't take a bite but was told it was ok but the hash brown potatoes were fire.

Parmesan Sourdough Cheeseburger - Nothing good or bad. Highly recommend mixing the ketchup and papa bear hot sauce together though. 

It's probably the food snob in me but if you looking for a lot of food that's done decent and at a price point for everyone then this should be one of your top options."}
{"text":"While waiting for my order, I watched a server pry hardened stuff clogging a squeeze bottle then using the bottle for orders, I then watched oranges fall on the ground from the juicing machine and the server picked up the oranges and used them. 
The cooks were extremely slow today"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times through the years. It's like the definition of comfort food. If you are looking for fancy, keep looking. This is like going to the neighbors for dinner. Huge portions big enough to share, and we usually do! 
Breakfast is when we normally com here but any time of day is just fine. Oh and don't forget to try a dessert."}
{"text":"Found this place by via Yelp. This place is out of this world amazing. Especially the orange juice, which is one of the best I've ever had.  Immediately orders a second glass after a few sips of the first. Go here."}
{"text":"The food was OK, but the wait for it was WAY too long and frankly it seemed like a pretty expensive check for two of us.  And I could DEFINITELY do without seeing the line chief place her grimy shoes on the low coffee-cup shelf so she can step high enough to reach the pass-through from the kitchen.   Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with Black Bear Diner.  The pancakes were fluffy ,rich, creamy and sweet.  The coffee was very tasty. Sausages were juicy.  The decor was fun with bears playing poker."}
{"text":"\"I don't want to ruin my $900 waffle iron but if you want chocolate chips in your waffle... we'll try it just for you.\" - the condescending, passive aggressive manager after both me and my friend's meals came out wrong. 
but besides that, great comfort food!"}
{"text":"Good dinner food. Great breakfast in a nice casual environment. It is a chain of 75 or so locations without the chain feel. Don't worry, you won't leave hungry, but if possible same room for one of their pies large enough to share it have all by yourself."}
{"text":"Still great as ever! Another breakfast date with my 16yr old son and was not disappointed. Heath the waiter is still here singing and dancing around, making sure the patrons are well-taken care of! Jennifer was ours today and she was great!"}
{"text":"First time here, loved it! Hubby had the Bacon BLAST for lunch, while I opted for the Volcano. So GOOD! Pancakes were sweet, tasty, and stayed warm until they were gone! Bacon was really good & crisp, too. Then hubby ordered a peach cobbler a là mode. Wow!Service was excellent. We will be back! (BTW, new location opening in 2016 at the old Applebee's location at Alma School & Queen Creek in Chandler. Can't wait!)"}
{"text":"Nice cozy restaurant but the breakfast was not any better than Denny's. Waitress was a bit on the rude side. I wasn't really impressed."}
{"text":"There was a brief wait when we arrived. The hostess was pleasant, and our server was efficient. Split The Grizz breakfast with my husband, got coffee, fresh squeezed oj, and the kids both got generously portioned breakfasts and chocolate milks. We had more than adequate portions, and left satisfied.  It's all American, yet a far sight better than Denny's, Waffle House, or Ihop! Will return,  it's close to home!"}
{"text":"We eat at Black Bear diner every time we stop in Vegas. We have only ever eaten breakfast and it never disappoints! Great portions, great prices, great food, and great staff. Only opportunity is the booths and furniture need repairs."}
{"text":"We were impressed for our first time. Service was slow but you could tell server was very busy and trying get his hardest. The burrito he gladly modified. Good portions will defiantly go to the one at home now"}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended we go to Black Bear Diner for dinner on Christmas day.  I had only eaten there once some years ago for breakfast and it was good.  So I said okay.  Not a good choice.  Their menu is a bit limited.  They only offer white mashed potatoes (what's wrong with yams?) with their  dinners.  Their green beans have bacon in it!!!  I wasn't told this when I ordered ask for them.  I don't eat bacon!!So my dinner consisted of two very nice pieces of ham (tasty and not at all salty) and cornbread stuffing.  Oh, and a dinner salad.  The coffee was a real disappointment.  I've had better at AM/PM out of a machine!!  

I also noticed their holiday decorations were almost non-existent.  It just wasn't festive. Made note to self NEVER TO GO TO THIS PLACE AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews and wanted to try it, and I'm so glad I did!  First of all, everyone who works there was soooo nice and friendly, which is awesome.  

I got the \"small\" version of... I can't remember what it was called but I'm pretty sure the word 'volcano' was in it.  Anyway it was 3 DELISH pancakes with an egg on top, and a sausage for $6.  Like I said, it's the \"small\" version and I couldn't even finish it.  Soooo good!  Their pancakes are to die for!

My mom got a Caesar salad that had won ton strip thingys and cashews in it.  She thought she'd eat half and save the rest for later, but she couldn't stop eating it.  I tried it and it was soooo good.  The chicken is a fresh breast of chicken, not lame cubes of it from a can or anything, and the dressing is excellent.  Try it!"}
{"text":"My fiancé took me here for the first time this afternoon.  Since this place is unfamiliar to me, naturally, I was a little apprehensive about coming, but I have heard nothing but good things about this place, so I wanted to try it anyway.  The decor reminded me of something you would see from a cabin in the woods - it was great, and the bar stools were made out of pieces of wood.  The entire staff was friendly and our server, Shannon, was a complete riot.  Love her.  She gave several recommendations off of the menu, but had a hard time picking just one - my fiance agreed that there is nothing bad at this place.  He ordered the fried chicken, and I had the breakfast chicken fried steak with scrambled eggs, hashbrowns, and added a biscuit, with gravy, of course.  Let me just say that the portions are HUGE, so if you leave hungry, it's your own fault.  My fiance is not fond of buttermilk biscuits (why, I'm not sure), but he loves theirs.  When you go up to pay, they also have the desserts on the display at the counter (yeah, they're evil like that), and even though they looked amazing, I chose not to get any.  Perhaps next time.  We'll definitely be back, that's for sure."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Black Bear, they are CONSISTENT. I'm from Northern California and this Black Bear is no different than the originals! Great food, great service and friendly people."}
{"text":"My family loves this place and we always eat here when they are in town. Portions and plates are big! You will need a to-go box. The service is great and friendly! I have never had a bad experience. Since moving to Tempe from Mesa, I haven't been visiting this location lately but I have done so about a month ago. The breakfast is my favorite and is served all day. I have gone out at 7 pm in the evening to have breakfast with my mom here. The bear claws that they sell in their pastry shelves are delicious. Be sure to share with someone as they are pretty big. I believe they also sell pies to-go. I would recommend this spot for breakfast, lunch or dinner if you're in the area."}
{"text":"It sucks to say but the waitress were not welcoming. I kept feeling like someone was staring and I would look around they would be staring, but not a friendly stare like \"can I refill your drink\".. a rude stare. The food did come in huge portions that can definitely be shared between two people. I had a breakfast dish and waffles. The flavors were not anything special from other places that sell breakfast."}
{"text":"Today was our first time eating here. My father lives this place and raves about it. So we decided to try it out before we left town, being we are from California. The service we received was exceptional. There were a few issues with the food but that was due to the cook not paying attention to the order properly. Took 5 times to get my wife's food right. The manager came over and took care of the issue and had no problems from there on. The food is amazing and will definitely be coming back next time in town."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Big portions so come hungry. Food is excellent with nice choices of American, Mexican (south of the cave), and Portuguese cuisines. Interesting menu with historic articles. Lube and inspection for a car in 1942 was $1.95!"}
{"text":"The area needed a sit down family style restaurant, BUT the wait is unacceptable!  Sunday we put our name on the list before 12:30 pm and we left after eating and it was after 2:30 pm.  

Food portions are very generous, husband and I could have very easily shared. 

Food was good too, meats on the Griz breakfast were all very good and pancakes as well. 

Orange juice is fresh squeezed, pricy but good. 

Would definitely come back and hope for a quicker in and out. 2.5 hours was a long breakfast!"}
{"text":"3 stars for service only.  Bit into my eggs only to pieces of the plate in my food! They comped my meal and I appreciated their good service but I'm grossed out that made it into my mouth :("}
{"text":"Great diner for breakfast,  lunch or dinner.  Very affordable menu with great customer service.  Has an old school chill friendly diner vibe. Will definitely be back and I definitely recommend checking it out. 2 people we spent like $22 and left full."}
{"text":"The thing about Vegas is that there are a ton of excellent restaurants off the Strip and in the neighborhoods.  The thing is, you have to either go by word of mouth or just stumble across one.

I want to extend \"word of mouth\" for this place.  It has a very California feel to it, which is a nice diversion from the usual Vegas.  The whole style reminds me of California Adventure/Grand Californian Hotel at Disneyland.  It has that same rustic style, and looks decidedly non-Vegas.  And yes, there are plenty of bears and bear pictures and bear statues.... But it works really well here.  It's charming and funny.

I tried their eggs benedict, and they know what they are doing.  I was really pleased by how well done the eggs were, and while I am not so much of a hash brown fan due to the wimpy little potato slivers that usually comprise a hash brown, these are potato CHUNKS.  They're cut as a standard hash brown, but they are huge pieces, and are excellent.

The service here was top-notch.  From the waitress, to the manager who stopped by to see how our meal was.  You know the drill: Manager stops by with the obligatory \"How is everything\" speech, and may or may not care about the answer.  The manager here was very sincere and genuine.  He clearly wanted to make sure that we were having an enjoyable time, and I was pleasantly taken aback by that.

When we left, the manager was again there, friendly as could be, and chatted us up while we cashed out.  There was a handful of staff members by the register, and again, it was surprising how friendly everyone was.  For a first time visit, they made us feel like old friends.

Granted, I've been here one time, and with my limited food experience from their menu, I don't know the full extent of how everything tastes.  But they impressed me enough to want to make this a regular spot.

I really liked this place a lot, and if in need of a new and different food option, this is an top-notch choice, and worth the drive over there."}
{"text":"As always wonderful food. Had the corned beef Hash, my wife had the thick cut bacon breakfast. Huge biscuits. BUT will not be coming back to this location. Even though the food is amazing the customer service was so bad that it ruined my breakfast. Rude waitress. Didn't catch her name, young blonde girl. Then when we went to pay the guy, who I'm assuming was the manager, didn't look up at me once as I paid for my meal. What a shame. Even the people behind us were complaining about the service. Usually you get what you pay for but I over paid this time..."}
{"text":"How do I start?? So I came here the day before Christmas eve at the end of last year, we sat down yadda yadda, and our waitress came up to us after like 15-20 minutes and for some reason has a major attitude. That's not going to fly with me. She was like this uber short, midget short kinda, Mexican chick. We place our drink order, which takes her forever to get. A simple water isn't so hard or is it?? I get my water and blehhh it's tap water!! That b*tch! So we 'finally' place our order. Half of my parter ordered the chicken pot pie and I the steak salad. Then she comes back ten minutes later to tell us that they ran out of pot pies! Lol. Absurd, they're known for their pot pies! So they change their order. Then she comes back again about ten minutes later, saying there are two pot pies left haha oh man! Two people out of the 4 that ordered one said okay, I'll take the pot pie. Yet, we see I'm the window a little later, 5 pot pies sitting there! Horrible service by a horrible waitress! One star for my yummy steak salad;-)."}
{"text":"This place is overrated Yas I said it!!!  I said it!!!  See my angry hanger face .... I can't fathom why this place is so highly rated because someone dumped a can of salt on my meal boom!!!  I ordered an open face turkey sandwich which has turkey smothered in salty AF gravy on top of dry hard bread and mash potatoes .. All I'm saying is everything is from a can, box or frozen!!!  I need a barrel of water and their pot roast has potatoes and carrots ..oh yassssss frozen can food nomzzzz LOLZ stop stop stop .. If you like their food here it's because of the breakfast isn't it?  I must've ordered wrong .. Boo!!!"}
{"text":"Great service every time. Just good old fashion dinner food. Large portions at good prices nothing more nothing less."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere! I joined my father and sister here for breakfast Sunday morning and there was no wait! I was expecting at least an hour wait but no, we were seated right away. Our waiter was nice, he had certain characteristics as all the rest of the wait staff...very southern, warm and welcoming. The food is great... appealing presentation and the quality of the food was better that I was expecting.. Fresh squeezed orange juice, literally they have a machine that does it in front of you. Try the pancakes, sweet cream pancakes are the best I have ever had..... My father is big on diners and he approves! I'm glad about that, I have had enough of IHOP! But seriously, give black bear diner a try, you wont be disappointed. 

*** I was raving about this place so much to my BF, we went to the location on Tropicana near his home and he loved it as well! I would however suggest the green valley location, its a newer building and I was feeling the atmosphere way more than the trop location."}
{"text":"I always passed by this place and never thought it will interest me until my sister wanted to come here. I like how all the decor is forest like. :) 

Came in, and got seated right away! 

I got the thick french toast. Not my favorite choice. Bummed.

We spilt our meals. :)

Sissy had The California benedict. It was absolutely amazing. I think this was the first time ever that my biscuit was crispy!!!!! It was perfect. Andddd the hash browns? Whooo, don't get me started on that. The potatoe was cut thick, not thin and all mashed up like other places.  It was well cooked, crisp and was delightful.  Best hash browns everrr!!!! Especially with the black bear diner original pepper sauce baby burn with ketchup was yummmyyyy.


I AM ONE HAPPY GIRL. I WOULD BE HAPPIER IF MY FRENCH TOAST WAS GOOD. BOOO.. so.... four stars.

ALL THIS DELICIOUSNESS WAS ALL UNDER 20 BUCKS!!!!!"}
{"text":"A fun atmosphere with GREAT food! We were greeted at the door by the cashier and asked how many? We got sat down right away. The food was served quick and the customer service was exceptional. Large menu, and the deserts are very good! We tried the banana creme pie and lets just say we will be going back for the desert alone! Great experience!"}
{"text":"My Bigfoot breakfast was filling and filling, but most importantly delicious. The servers were friendly and attentive, but not intrusive. The cost to portion to quality all seem to be balanced as can be.  I will continue to return to Black Bear Diner."}
{"text":"Portions HUGE!  Rough night.  Waiting 30 min for a table... No biggie it's Friday night.  But our server could not handle the rush.  Waited 10 min (not an exaggerated time) for drinks then placed our order!  My food had a hair in it (it happens) but my friend son got presented a meal he did not even order and we're hoping in a few months things settle in and service and everything is more smooth and better!"}
{"text":"Huge portions, friendly staff and good flavor for an affordable price. My coffee cup never went empty.  Not too bad for a chain. The buttermilk pancakes are bomb! This is definitely a place we like to visit again."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was horrible. I'd say we ate for 15 minutes but was there for 45 minutes on top of the 30 minute wait we did waiting for a seat due to waiting for our server. My order was wrong and we were missing 2 drinks, on top of that they kept giving us biscuits thinking it would rectify the situation. All the servers were young and seemed to not really care about their job. For our first visit, the expectations weren't met here and it wasn't even that high, which sucks because I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"Our first time here...No meat just the eggs please... I'm trying to cut meat and this meal as u c delicious.  Sherrie was our wonderful waitress"}
{"text":"This restaurant might not be racist but they don't really treat you very nice.  If you have a Groupon.....make sure you print it because the waitress told us that they would not honor it because it was not printed. She was a little rude about it.  The manager did honor it after we asked her to ask the manager otherwise she wasn't going to.  Then when my husband and I go to pay the bill the hostess was pushy. My husband was pulling up the Groupon on his phone and she told him that she wanted the receipt, I told her that he was pulling up the groupon to give to her. Not very nice she said yes I was told about it, very pushy and inpatient.   Everything on the menu is about 9 and up. The other location on Bell is really friendly.  Don't see us going back to this location."}
{"text":"Short and simple Black Bear Diner is a keeper for us. Service is great plenty parking and yes the food is also great and lots of it. My place for bear food"}
{"text":"We had a pretty good experience at this location...  We came on a weekday morning, and they weren't too busy. We were seated quickly, and because I've been to other locations here in town, we knew what we wanted and ordered as our drinks were arriving at the table. Our food came out pretty quickly and it tasted good.

The only problem that we had; the waitress checked on us early into our meal and then we didn't see her for quite a while. As a result our waters and coffees weren't filled as we ate.

As stated in other reviews: this location is newly opened; so they are still working out the 'new restaurant' issues. 

I'm certain we'll be back to this location soon."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast spot. Big servings at a reasonable price. I love the theme of the restaurant and they also have different products that you can purchase. Went on a Friday morning after work with a coworker and was seated right away. Our waitress was friendly and fast to get our food and drinks. Checked on us often and since it was my first time there, explained to me what their restaurant was all about and offered recommendations. I ordered their Portuguese sausage and eggs (definitely not like Portuguese sausage from Hawaii, but it was still good) and I was pleasantly surprised that they gave me the whole stick of sausage haha. It also came with a slice of watermelon, hash browns, and pancakes. I didn't think I was gonna finish it, but I guess I was more hungry than usual that morning. And I was totally in a food coma on the way home. Lol. I love their baby bear hot sauce - tasted great with the food I ordered. They have 2 other sauces on each of their tables - mama bear and papa bear. I will try those next time I visit. I don't think there was anything that makes this restaurant really stand out compared to other places similar to it, but I had a good first experience so I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend. Lal lee mac from Liverpool. Such a wonderful find. We all had various things for breakfast from pancakes to eggs and sausage. So so good. And reasonably priced for quality food with polite and friendly service. Must try omelettes. Great coffee. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is the second time my man and I have checked out this restaurant and we always share items, so I've tasted at least four items and have been pleasantly surprised by all. If we go out, it's usually only for breakfast, and this is one of our favorites (omelet house being another fav). As far as breakfast goes, a lot try, but few make the grade. TRY THIS PLACE!!! The sweet cream pancakes are AMAZING. I had the Californian Benedict last time and the whole table was jealous...Hahahaha I tried the ScramBowl this time and it was great! Too big for me, but great taste, not bland. And ALWAYS go for the red potato option..the hash browns were alright, but had nothing on the red potatoes. Service is always great..never an unhappy server. The one we had this morning was particularly sweet..Beatriz...very contagiously happy person!"}
{"text":"Two stars for better than average ambience and decent coffee.  Other than that the food is straight off the back of a Sysco truck - which is to say meh, at best.  If you are sensitive to industrial food (preservatives, etc) I would steer clear.  Service is OK, but you come to a restaurant to eat good food, this is Denny's only 30% more expensive."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and had a mixed experience.  I had their  Cinnamon  roll French toast and thought it was delicious.  Everything went down hill from there. 

I thought it was great that Black Bear offered a smaller size omelet for those not looking to have a large meal.  My wife ordered a small ham and cheese omelet and we were both shocked when we saw the hideous thing that was brought out.  It was two fried eggs with unmelted cheese and uncooked ham on top of it.  We sent it back to get melted. After they microwaved it, the dish became extremely greasy and salty.  It was gross.  Also, our sodas were flat and overly sweet with syrup.  

The French toast earned 2 of the 5 stars back after they lost all there stars on the omelet."}
{"text":"When leaving Arizona and heading back to a Black Bear Diner deprived area of California, I knew this was the smart lunch choice. The food is consistent, you get what you pay for, and the service is always good. 

I ordered a tri-tip sandwich that was one of the best I've enter had.  I'm not sure if it was the tri-tip or the onions and cheese, but it had an amazing flavor. My side salad with bacon ranch dressing was fresh and fantastic. 

Service was prompt and friendly enough. 

I seriously took off one star because they serve Pepsi. I'm sorry Black Bear Diner, but that's the one way you ruin a stellar meal! Lol"}
{"text":"The portions are huge! But the food is pretty good, just like any ol'diner. I gotta say that I'm most impressed by the customer service. They are really nice and attentive. I saw a group of old people stop and ask the busser for their drinks. His name was Sameer (Samir?) either way, he was seemed super nice and someone that actually cares about his job! For that I like this place more! I hope Sameer wins the lottery"}
{"text":"Awesome experience!! Amazing food, large portions and Yessie took great care of us!! She was our favorite!!! We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"After eating here a few times this place isn't up to par with other locations I've been to and yesterday is most likely the last time.  The wait staff are nice but the food is low quality.  I ordered the hot turkey sandwich.  The turkey was a light purple color (odd and ick) nothing was hot, it wasn't appetizing at all. my wife has a cheese burger that looked old, as if had been sitting... nothing was good.  bottom line: Pass on this location."}
{"text":"Busy breakfast spot with large portions, friendly staff and a low cal menu as well. Great I-10 stop."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. We came close to closing but our waitress was very accommodating and didnt rush us. The omelets were outstanding and cooked perfectly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Family out for breakfast, Great service, good food, right off the 10 freeway so very convenient."}
{"text":"We were really excited about trying Black Bear. They sat us in a corner \"booth\" right next to the window. No one came over to even talk to us for 15 minutes after we were seated. When a busser noticed we were sitting he came over and asked if we had questions. That began an onslaught of people (we literally had 3 different people wait on us). I, of course, ordered fried chicken. The meal has a lot of options, soup or salad, veggies or Italian style green beans, lots of carb options & a corn muffin. The waiter did not ask about any of my options past salad. I had to remind him about the other choices. I selected Italian green beans & mashed potatoes with brown gravy. Honey ordered a western burger with Parmesan chips. When I got my salad the lettuce was freshly washed, but not dried so there was a ton of water on the plate. Nothing special, just greens, shredded carrot, 2 slices of cucumber & 2 grape tomatoes. When our meals finally came my green beans, potatoes & gravy were cold, but the plate was \"hot\" according to our runner. We had to send back the food as it was completely inedible. The manager \"graciously\" took my meal off our bill (considering I didn't eat it, I guess that's gracious of him...I don't know). The reason I am giving 2 stars over 1 is that honey liked his burger. The service wasn't great, I couldn't try the food tho it looked ok (but I never got my cornbread muffin). If we come back we might try breakfast, but they may need to work out some kinks."}
{"text":"This is one of the best family restaurants in Vegas! Great down home cooking (and lots of it!), VERY clean, great prices and the best service we've had anywhere! They serve the best bacon and they have delicious huckleberry ice cream, not to mention their pastries. We walk in there and feel right at home! We go as often as we can. Thanks Black Bear Henderson!"}
{"text":"Worst food I've had in a while. Very bland no seasoning. Grilled veggie total mush over cooked. Only edible on plate was backed potato. Service marginal. Will never go back!"}
{"text":"First time at the specific location terrible wait for food had to wait 40 mins for my meal and for them to bring me my side dish first. If you guys love to wait almost an hour for your food this is the place for you. We didn't even eat because of the frustration first and last time coming to this specific Black bear diner. I should have listened to my coworkers that said not to come here.."}
{"text":"When in Rome, eat pizza.

If you're in Buffalo, NY, you must have wings.

West Tropicana and Jones Blvd??  Chicken fried steak.  

I'll call it CFS from here on out but \"Chicken from Satan\" might be a better acronym.

It's rare that I get out of bed early enough on a Sunday to check out any of the dizzying array of excellent brunches around Vegas.  So when my first 2 planned spots went to hell, I chose to eat my feelings at the Black Bear Diner.  Anyone that works here will tell you that CFS is the most popular dish.  They were coming out of the kitchen and into the packed dining area like an assembly line.

Beef that is breaded and deep fried like chicken is kind of a mind blowing thing for non-Americans.  I had to repeat how my entrée was being prepared to my Japanese wife twice.  It was a lot to wrap her head around and it should!!  According to BlackBearDiner.com, the CFS with hash browns, gigantic biscuit and 2 eggs totals 1580 total calories, 70 grams of fat, 20 grams of saturated fat, 4870 mg of sodium and 170 grams of carbs.  Holy....fucking.....shit.  This is the exact opposite of Crossfit.  CrossFAT!!

Funny how \"comfort food\" always makes me feel like death at the end.  Good thing the urgent care center across the street stays open late."}
{"text":"This place is just what I needed!  Black Bear wins for awesome diner fare, fast service and a super friendly waitstaff.  

Black Bear is great little diner just off the strip.  We stopped in here on the way out to Red Rock Canyon and were happy that we did!  Denise was the sweetest lady and the food was served quick.  I recommend any of the omelettes.  They come with a nice serving of homefries and toast/bagel/english muffins.  You won't leave this place hungry!"}
{"text":"Omg....these people are so very nice and helpfull.  And i will go becouse of the great service i get from.   Don.  April.  Mirella.  Angie
If these people arnt there i dont go.
Fantastic people and service."}
{"text":"I usually go to the Black Bear Diner for breakfast when visiting Vegas.  The bear murals are fun kitsch, the portion sizes are huge, and the prices are inexpensive compared to the Strip."}
{"text":"A really complete menu from which to choose. Service was prompt, courteous, attentive and food service was fast. Burger was excellent (fries -meh), mom's omelet was great w. A side of fresh fruit.  Server was very very good - if I wasn't already retired, I'd have talked to him about what else he'd like to do...."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of chains but made an exception for this place.  Been there 3 times and found the food and service excellent!"}
{"text":"This place is great. We arrived in Vegas early in the morning, we were all super hungry and tired from the long drive. We were looking for a nice family restaurant to eat at, and this place is literally exactly what we wanted. You get a lot of food for a pretty decent price. I really liked the theme of the restaurant and the cute little stuffed animals that lined the walls. Also for all Pokemon players- this place has a gym, so that's always a plus. If we lived in Vegas we would definitely be coming here every Saturday morning for our family breakfast."}
{"text":"stopped here on our way home on a road trip.  if i had known, i would've stopped on the way out, too.  the bear name drew me in (and the assumption that a diner would have chocolate malts).  

the food was fantastic.  boyfriend ordered \"bob's big bear burger\" and it was probably the biggest hamburger i've seen in person.  apparently it was delicious (how he ate the whole thing, i will never know).  i ordered some sort of burger basket combo, featuring a much smaller cheeseburger (which was delicious), hearty portion of fries (which were ok), and the chocolate malt was only $2.99 (instead of $4.50-ish)  with the combo.  And it was one of the best chocolate malts I've ever had.  And the prices were reasonable.  And I actually loved the kitschy bear theme.  Can't wait for another trip that takes me through Phoenix (and I never thought I would say that)."}
{"text":"It's 2:20pm on a Sunday, decided to come here with my parents. Very country style restaurant, love it!! The food was okay, my beer tasted a bit flat, but no biggie. Shame they didn't have something to snack on while sitting there waiting for you food to come. My parents dishes came out and I was sitting and waiting for mine to arrive and it didn't for 15min. I was sitting and drooling. I'll be back, but probably not going to go when I am super hungry."}
{"text":"Place was a mess. Tables not cleaned off.  When entering I waited 10 minutes for a table then the people behind me just sat down so I did the same. Service was terrible I even thought about going to the other location cation on Tropicana which is an excellent location.  Black Bear needs to fix this location as I for one will not be back. Tropicana location will be my choice"}
{"text":"We had breakfast here, beware you will get a ton of food! I got the bowl, can't remember actual name but it was really good!"}
{"text":"Even though it is a chain, it still has that small business, small town feeling. When we walked in, they had oldies playing and my mom about lost it. She took the menu home with her because she loved it so much. I had the California Benedict and it was, as Will Ferrel would say, Scrumtrulecent. The food was filling, the portions were massive, and the atmosphere was on point for breakfast."}
{"text":"There is something quite off about this restaurant and I can't put my finger on it.   In this review I will cover the hottest day in this restaurants history, and that's a fact.  

The atmosphere was mostly a mix of beautifully designed theme furniture and cute wall and chair art that will zoom you away to the open Midwestern wilderness faster than a scoop of calgon and a click of the Ruby slippers.  But none of this could possibly have been enjoyed on the fateful day my partner and I decided to dine here because the air was thick, humid and above anything else and to my dismay in hoping to escape the torturous sweltering of the Las Vegas summer, the establishment's air had gone out.  My partner and I for some reason decided we could still \"make it werq\".  Little did we know, the food of this restaurant would leave a lot to be desired especially given the reputation painted by the employees when we made our initial queries of the dishes.

We decided to get our food to go even if our waitress was wonderful (Tara or something).  When we got home we expected warm food but it was worth it given the cool 74° we keep our apartment, which is literally down the street.  

The bacon cheeseburger was quite a lot to look at, but tasted of day old McDonald's and lard.  There were plenty of fries, but even they were tasteless and underseasoned. The serving size is large to extra large but the flavor is lacking to non existent.  Too bad, because until I ate here I thought nothing with bacon could taste flavorless.  What a sad day.

The new York steak was dry but still seasoned appropriately which saved it from the trash cans wide hungry mouth.  since all the food was to go, my poor steak was shoved into little Styrofoam boxes.  The presentation therefore was as it should be.  Acceptable when taking into consideration the size of the serving.  I asked for Brown beef gravy and somehow I got white gravy.  But the waitress did offer a choice of 3 gravies.  Idk whose fault that would be.  The cooks?  Management? Waitress?

I recommend the bear claw with almonds.  The waitress heated the pastry which made it softer.  The buttery and rich taste complemented my bitter decaffeinated coffee well and the size of the pastry is definitely something to write home about.  Truly an exciting way to start or end a meal:)

I think having no air was the worst mistake in the history of restaurants and I even had to Google if Donald Trump owned this chain which has a dozen locations sprinkled in the western US(he doesnt).  If they are going for comfort food I would add more flavor.  If they are going for home style cooking, I would add more flavor.  If they want to compete with Biscuits cafe, The Egg and I, Le Belle Terre, Blue Ox, and the various lunch options in the area, they need to step up their game.  Get the order right, keep it warm or hot, and make sure it's not a humid sweltering oven inside of your establishment.  These are the basics, and I think Bob and Laurie Manley might need to go back to them.  

In conclusion the atmosphere is spot on thanks to the wood workings of Ray Schulz and the \"sweeping, colorful, bear-mottled murals\" of Steve and Gary Fitzgerald.  Tara the server is quaint and friendly and seems to take her position as a lighthearted ambassador of comestibles and libation.  The food itself is lacking.  And the AIR CONDITIONER WAS NOT WORKING:(  I might come back in a few months.  Until then I will not recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Summer is the worst server in the world. Could not be bother doing her job. I could have gotten better service at McD's"}
{"text":"OoohMmmmGeee peeps, you must go to Black Bear and have a meal!!  The service is great, meals taste like its homemade and GREAT portions!!  And did I mention, the price is cheap!  Highly recommend this place!!    Wish we had Black Bear on Oahu.  Two thumbs!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday at 1040 in the morning and it was pretty packed. It was just myself and that would've been a 15 minute wait so I opted to sit up at the bar seats. My order was taken and writhing 5 mins received my 3 links, hash brown, sunny side up eggs. The waitress was attentive and fast and welcoming. The food was pretty good and sure is a spot for some decent breakfast!"}
{"text":"Black Bear remains a solid breakfast choice.  Classic standbys and a few tasty healthy options (egg whites, etc.) as well.  Beat the rush and head in early!"}
{"text":"I'm from northern California where there are many black bear diners but never managed to stop into one.  I moved right around the corner to this location here in Las Vegas, drive passed it everyday so finally decided to try it.  It was just as you would expect your neighborhood diner to be; Large hearty portions, warm friendly faces, quick service, yummy food! Cindie was our server, she was great!  Overall we had a great experience, this place makes you feel like family!"}
{"text":"I love me some Black Bear!! The staff is so personable and friendly (and I'm not just saying that because they gave me blueberry and regular pancakes) hahaha their pancakes are superb and sausage, omg..just great place for breakfast!! I'll keep you posted on the lunch and dinner on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Very impressed!
I came here on New Year's day because my other breakfast spot was closed so I figured why not try something new. Right when we walked in, it was packed full. I figured it was just due to the holiday and accepted the 25 min wait time. Once seated we had excellent service! I was so amazed by how great our waitress was even though she had many other tables. The food was DELSIH and man what a big portion! 
The only reason I am giving 4 starts out of 5 is due to the wait time. 
This establishment is certainly worth the wait."}
{"text":"RAWR !!! if you have a phobia of bears ... don't come here, they are literally EVERYWHERE !!!  Inside and outside (no live animals were hurt, that I know of)

So I went to Black Bear when I was in Utah, and I wanted to check it out to see if it was the same.   It reminds me of restaurant chains similar to Denny's and IHOP.  Note this location is busy so don't come starving.   

They serve breakfast lunch and dinner ALL DAY.   My family and I came here for breakfast and portions are reasonable for the price.  The food is good/ok, nothing to brag about, but not bad either, same goes for the service.   

After my visit I found out you get free coffee and a bear claw for signing up for their rewards card program ... maybe I'll do that if I ever come back here."}
{"text":"I was thrilled seeing one of the (million) umpteen empty strip mall places in my area was becoming a Black Bear Diner. I've eaten at locations in Northern California a few times and found them to be dependable comfort food at a great price.

In a nutshell, the Tempe location needs some work - a LOT of work - before they reach the level of standards I've come to know of Black Bear. 

The service was friendly, although everyone seemed to not know what they were doing or where they were supposed to be. They only offered to refill our waters literally when we were ready to walk out the door. I could have used that water when trying to choke down dried up meatballs...

I ordered the Spaghetti and Meatballs and was thoroughly disappointed. The noodles were fine, the sauce was relatively uninspiring and the meatballs could only be classified as WMDs... they were so overcooked and old that I could have hurt someone by tossing one at their face. Meatballs should very easily be cut with the side of a fork - I couldn't get through these buggers. Solid as a rock. They were utterly tasteless and not something I would feed my old, blind, deaf dog. When a server FINALLY made it back to our table to check on us, I told her they were inedible and she replaced them. But by that point, I'd had my fill of my spaghetti and took one bite of a new meatball and promptly put everything in a to-go box. The new meatballs were better - albeit pretty greasy. I'm wondering if they threw them in a deep fryer to moisten them up a bit. 

My husband's Chicken Fried Steak - while delivered several minutes after the rest of our meal - was perfectly cooked and very nicely flavored. The gravy - perfect. Potatoes - perfect. Eggs - perfect. We ended up taking the biscuits home and I tried eating one for breakfast today and it was inedible - \"dry as a popcorn fart\" as my brother would say. Tasted like packing material. Our daughter gobbled up her kid's scrambled eggs and absolutely loved the apple dish. 

I regretted ordering anything but breakfast and will probably file this place in the \"breakfast only\" category."}
{"text":"At first our server had a bit of a nasty attitude . It was kinda lame but my friend husband and I still continued to be nice to hopefully she changed her attitude towards the end she change her mood and gave us the service we deserve. This place is amazing I will be returning. Now I get what my husband meant when he said \"better than Denny's\""}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner has been my favorite place for breakfast for the past 3 years.  Until today, we never had a single complaint.  
Today we had a not so great experience.  After waiting for over a half hour to be seated (which was normal), our server was sort of abrupt and not very friendly, but we ignored that fact.  We were all pretty hungry, so we anxiously waited for our food.  Surprisingly once our food came, it was not so great.  I ordered a pancake with my eggs over easy breakfast and it was not fluffy but rather firm and stiff and had such a strong taste of vanilla it was just horrible, I took 2 bites and just left it.. My husband ordered the chicken enchiladas and he said they didn't taste the same as the last 2 times he ordered them, said they were made spicier and a weird flavor, not the way he liked them before.  My grandson ordered a bacon cheese burger and fries.  This kid never complains about his food, but when I asked why he wasn't eating his fries, he said they were hard like sticks and the hamburger has not much of a flavor and did not taste so good.  He ate part of it and left almost all of his fries on his plate.  I got coffee when we first sat down and our server never came around to warm it up until we were almost finished eating.  My grandson was needing a refill of his Sprite,but didn't get a refill until, again, we were almost done.  The service is going down hill, the food is not quite as good as it used to be.
We made the decision to find somewhere closer to where we live to have breakfast, just not worth the drive anymore."}
{"text":"Such a cute little diner! Love the fact they serve all their menu all day, so for breakfast I had the chicken avocado club sandwich and fries! Huge portion, definitely a meal to split! 

Sarah my waitress was super attentive, refilling my drinks and checking on me often. Very friendly even though she was super busy. 

Nice little find for a work trip"}
{"text":"I was excited that there was a black bear er on this side of town. To my surprise, I was bummed having experienced what I did at this place. 
We were sat immediately and given menus. We all knew what we wanted to order, so when our server came to take our drink order she turned and was going to walk away until we raised our voice that we were ready. She took our order and left. They gave us a children's menu with nothing to write with. Our drinks were incorrect. When we called upon someone to fix these things no one came back. I had to walk to the front where there was 4 girls there speaking to each other, and was handed a non working pen for my kid. The server came back completely unaware that our drinks were incorrect, she fixed them. Our food came out, looked great. That's the best part of this is how well the food LOOKED. The waffle was a HUNK of dough internally.  The pancakes were so thick they weren't cooked all the way, so they smushed together when you tried to cut them. The hash-browns were crispy on the outside, but once again mushy on the inside. Yes the serving sizes are over the top, but that doesn't equate quality food. Overall, the service and food was not what I've experienced from black bear before. Sincerely disappointed."}
{"text":"It was my second time visit to Black Bear Diner since a couple years back. 
All I can remember is that I had a big portion of comfortable and tasty breakfast meal with a strong cup of coffee( I enjoy drinking bold in the morning). I decided to try it again on one Sunday morning. 
When I walked in, it was a full house! I waited about 5 min and got a table. 
I knew what I wanted,,, Omelette, Omelette, & Omelette :) 

*My Happy Meal of the Dayyy: 

1. South of the Border Omelette-seasoned ground beef OR chorizo with ortega chilies, jack cheese, avocado and homemade salsa, served with a flour tortilla. Choice of strip-cut hash browns OR red diced potatoes($8.99): I had the chorizo and the red potatoes.. 

2. Coffee with vanilla cream and sugar: It was bold & smooth. 

Well, I really enjoyed my meal. The service was provided promptly by friendly waitress. The portion was HUGE that I had to take some home. There was no cut-off time for ordering breakfast here. I prefer real all day breakfast places for a late breakfast( I am pretty much a late riser on weekends). I noticed that a full service menu is offered for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I'll definitely give them another shot. Nowadays, I can't seem to find very many good hole in the wall, mom and pop owned places to have a breakfast in LV. It is definitely a chain world out here in the city! Sad, really....However, The Black Bear Diner serves up some good home cooking :) There are no strangers here at the Black Bear - only friends you haven't met yet :P"}
{"text":"It's definitely not my first option to choose but it was a great spot for date night with the gramps. 

One thing I did like seeing were some healthy options and 'less portion' entrees as well. Everything can be adjusted to be calorie friendly, it's just a matter of making the right choice."}
{"text":"Food was only so-so.  Ordered eggs Benedict and the eggs were cold when my plate came to me.  My bacon was floppy, but I figured it was because it had sat under my eggs for a while.  Not just me though, my niece had bacon beside her french toast and it was just as badly done.  She loves the stuff but wouldn't touch it.

Waitress took my plate without asking me if I was done yet.

I wasn't.   :("}
{"text":"The food was not worth the price and the customer service was awful all though the waffles were great and they came with a little bear paw in the middle.  Other than that I was very unsatisfied. I feel like I had a much better experience at the one on Tropicana and I don't know if it's just cause I got a bad dish this time around but the food seemed better at the Tropicana location too."}
{"text":"Honestly. I don't know why this restaurant is rated so highly. As a matter of fact, the two stars I'm giving them is being overly generous. My daughter ordered the grilled steak salad and while it was quite a generous portion of salad, where was the steak? Three pieces, count 'em, THREE pieces of steak. As we were leaving the restaurant, we happened to look over at a gentleman who had ordered the same thing and just received his meal. SIX pieces of steak. Count 'em, SIX! Why the difference? You tell me Black Bear. I ordered the French Dip sandwich. Nicely portioned as well but the meat was overcooked, dry and underseasoned. Now; about the wait staff. Had they just served all ok Las Vegas? It seemed so with those tired looks and inattentiveness. Will we ever go back. NOT ON YOUR LIFE. (The one extra star is for the portion sizes)."}
{"text":"Good food, and good service what more do you want. The portions are big, and they make delicious homemade biscuits. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is my second time around the first time it was so so, so I had to try again. Except this time around I ordered a Western Burger medium rare and it came out medium rare cooked and it was a decent burger. Nothing to go compelty crazy over but it was a decent burger. The service was good and the waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great staff. Big foot breakfast could feed a family."}
{"text":"Always a win on a Sunday morning for our family. We love going there, as long as we can get in or beat their lines. It's always so packed with people. But hey, good for them. They did well and their food is rather enjoyable!"}
{"text":"So I called in for an order at 925am hoping to get my food before 10a since I work across the street and start at 10. Lady put me on hold for 13 mins in fact I drove to the place and still was on hold. I tried to see if I. An get my food by then but it would've made me late. The ladies were nice however the one that put me on hold told me she tried to get me back on the line but couldn't??? Like you couldn't un hold me? Anyways they just opened and what way to start off my experience after telling everyone at work this place is awesome."}
{"text":"I have been to the other ones in Las Vegas and this was my second trip to this one. At 6 am we were one of three tables ...My coffee mug was dirty....there was no spoon to stir my coffee.. there was dust on the window sill...The waitress was busy with paper work while I waited for a clean coffee mug. .. The food was barely warm... .. for a breakfast place they need to do a better job of blocking the direct sunlight in the early morning....no matter where you sit the sun is in your eyes.... I doubt that I will be going back to this location....It is a shame because it is about 3 miles from my house.... Sorry"}
{"text":"My husband went to breakfast here this morning for the first time. I honestly didn't know it was there. Loved the atmosphere and decor- cute bears and rustic signs. Hope, our waitress was excellent despite the fact they were under-staffed and very busy. I ordered the biscuits and gravy with sausage and it was very good- large portion and well seasoned. The hash browns were delicious but not as good as the country potatoes which had red and green bell peppers and onions. My husband had the Denver omelet made with egg whites and it was delicious as well. Good coffee- would love to find out what brand they use. Extensive menu with something for everyone- can't wait to try it for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"great Place!! great Service!!  Big Portions !! no waiting time for sunday at 11am, a little far from the strip but worth the drive"}
{"text":"In the face of hunger and adversity, I wandered in to Black Bear Diner.  I found a table and sat down only to discover my place next to an irate customer who swore to have found onions in his hasbrowns (even tho this is not BBD's standard).  It was jolting and uncomfortable to say the least.  Jessica, our shared wait staff, handled it with grace and levity. I ordered the ribeye, which in a diner is a risky proposition, only to be surprised by the accuracy of the cook.  And furthermore, I found Jessica and other staff to be attentive and generous!!!"}
{"text":"My first review of this location was very negative, but those were apparently new location opening problems that incensed me. Since then service both front of the house and kitchen are now up to par. Menu excellent. Food excellent. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"They all was make me feel at home and comfortable and the service is never less then amazing also the food is always cooked to perfection and the staff provided a safe environment"}
{"text":"First time at a BBD and didn't realize this was the grand opening day. Fun and friendly environment. Large appealing portions. The service was attentive. Will return!"}
{"text":"Food- The sweet cream pancakes were good.  However, other food is basic fare: the homemade sausage has too much fennel or some other spice in it, hash browns overcooked/undercooked plate to plate, coffee so-so, chorizo and eggs okay.

Service- The waitress we had gave service like a robot...not very personable to the point she seemed pissed off.  

Decor- I think the bear thing is overdone i.e. how do they clean all the stuffed bears lining the ceiling?  I think the place could use some updating and they could lose some bears."}
{"text":"The food is amazing here! However my 2 star review is because of the service.  We had a party of 13 and when we got here were quoted a 35 minute wait time.  We also stated that we were fine. After waiting, for 55 mins with no air conditioning we got up to leave and told the girls that worked up front that we were leaving as they had not sat up but sat 5 parties of 6 or more instead.  My dad asked for the the manger and the hostess started laughing because apparently it was funny. We spoke with the manager who wasn't very apologetic. He did say that they now had a table. It took about 10 more minutes before we were seated. Once seated we had no menus and it took another 5 minutes to get them.  I have eaten at a ton of other Black Bear's not only in Las Vegas. I am beyond disappointed and I may never come back. As of now we have not gotten our food and we are going on 1.5 hours of waiting.

Edit: by the time we got our food and got out of there is was 90 degrees and almost 2 hrs our waiter was nice but the food was wrong on a couple of items. The manager did give use 20% off and a couple pies, so that was a plus. I don't think I will be going back to this location anytime soon."}
{"text":"If your staying in Vegas, do yourself a favor and get off the strip and the crazy prices and get yourself a real breakfast. Very good and large quantiles. As usual the OJ is fresh squeezed and the service was fast and polite."}
{"text":"The Joes Hobo Omelette is the best!! The service is okay at this place but the food is what makes this place special. Best place for breakfast with family!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast a while back and the food was great. Only little problem there wasn't enough people working that day and the food and beverages were delayed."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place on the way to Red Rock Casino.  I went ahead and got the 3/4 pound Big Bear Burger that takes up the whole plate.  My local friend said the breakfast they serve is oversized if you want.  Some oversized people up in here too.  I got a kick out of the large bear carvings inside and out.  The waitresses also make fresh o.j. with the machines sitting right in the dining area.  What a trip."}
{"text":"It is a chain but feels a bit more country kitchen than most.  Food is simple home cooking and there is plenty of it.  Nothing stood out but nothing was terrible.  The biggest surprise was clam chowder soup.  It was full of clams, not too salty and full of flavor.  

When we want simple food done well this is the spot."}
{"text":"It's a diner with decent food.

Nothing special, nothing bad either.  Decent service, good tasting food.  Very heavy, greasy food, but tastes great.  A little pricey, for a diner.  Breakfast for two, one coffee was $24.00 and their fruit bowl consisted of 10 pieces of honey dew and 4 grapes... pretty sucky."}
{"text":"Solid food, good value, huge portions, and just good old fashioned country cooking.  

I ordered the Friday Fish Fry which is AYCE fried fish filets.  It comes with a pile of fries and a side of coleslaw.  The wife ordered the rainbow trout with a couple of veggies on the side.  

The servers are friendly and competent.  They run around a bit haphazard but get the job done.  The place is pretty clean for a family joint that has kids dropping food on the floor.  

This is definitely not a place for a first date or to take a client to lunch.  But, if you want a pile of decent food this is the place."}
{"text":"I called ahead of time because I had a large group and we came here with a party of 40. And they were able to accommodate us ! We all sat together at two tables which was perfect for parents at a table and players and coaches at another. They helped us with separate checks as well. The food was very large portions and everyone seemed very satisfied. This is a family restaurant with experienced staff! I would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"We went in for breakfast on Sunday. There was not much of a wait and the staff was really friendly. The food was just ok, definitely nothing special. I had an omelette and it hardly had any cheese in it and not much flavor and not worth the $. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been there twice and both times the service was bad and the food mediocre. The server made us feel like we were bothering him."}
{"text":"Great food,service, and atmosphere. Zero complaints from the kiddos too. Looks like we found another \"family spot\" when we are on this side of town."}
{"text":"Good Ol' American style comfort food!  Chicken fried steak, pot roast, etc.

Can you say \"meat and potatoes\"??  hahaha  I liked the place a lot, but, seriously... American food is last on my list of \"likes\" when it comes to food.  With that said I'd come here again.  Good food, good service, good value for the $$... definitely a \"go to\" spot if you are into American food."}
{"text":"Good home style breakfast. I checked yelp for another breakfast place to go to. I always go to egg and i and wanted to try something else. I came here and it was good. Has a black bear theme through out. Food is good. Customer service was great. i felt like everyone that worked there included my server checked on me and made sure everything was ok, and it was. Good home feeling there. I would definitely return and recommend this place."}
{"text":"Discovered this place at the west side location, it was pretty good. Moved to the east side and found this location. This location is super good. We've been many times. My whole family loves the breakfast here. Lunch is also good. The staff were very attentive and nice. They have menus on cute faux newspapers that tell of local history. Love the little things they have here. The portions for breakfast are huge. It's hard not to stuff yourself here. Love the biscuits (which are huge) & gravy.  Great place for breakfast. You most likely will have a short wait on the weekends mornings & late mornings."}
{"text":"Mom's Day.   Dad's Day.   Let's just make up one and call it Black Bear Diner Day, and I'll gladly go for breakfast, even if I have to endure a little wait.

The orange juice is freshly squeezed, comes in a large glass, and  tastes like cutting an orange in half and making sweet oral love to it.
The food is really good.  Everything except the bear claw, ironically, but really, everything else, from fresh fruit, to griddle items, to biscuits&gravy, to even a cheapo steak & eggs has been certified as yummy by either myself or a close family member anywhere from kid to grandparents.  

Service ranges from acceptable to nice and friendly, and with the tiny bear paws running the length of their kooky suspenders as part of their uniforms, you hardly even notice most of them have freaky punky tattoos up and down their necks,etc.

Breakfast is a 4.5 over several occaisions, and I'm factoring in one late lunch experience at around a 3.75-4.

Black berry shake is a fizzle to the -ive point oh, fo' sho'"}
{"text":"I had heard a good deal of positive things about this restaurant before I was able to get in there and try them.  I love the atmosphere of the restaurant and the staff was friendly and efficient.  I've only eaten items off their breakfast menu but their plates were absolutely huge!  I was unable to finish my meal both times I've visited and they keep the coffee flowing which is always a plus.

I can't speak for other items on their menu but if you are looking for a great breakfast I would recommend skipping IHOP (located across the street) and stopping in at Black Bear Diner,  The food is great, they provide a child friendly atmosphere and the prices are low considering the amount of food you receive,  Definitely give them a chance if you are in the area,"}
{"text":"So I had the corn beef hash breakfast with the hash browns , and a side pancake , everything was amazing the hash browns are hands down some of the best I have ever had and the hash is fresh real meat and potatoes. I asked for well done and it was crunchy and amazing . This pancake made with sweet cream was soooo fluffy and creamy and slightly sweet and thanks our server alex the great he brought out hot butter and syrup together and told me to rip and dip and boy did I , soooooo good I will definitely be back and the portions where pretty large as well. Amazing yummy spicy full of flavor mama burn sauce"}
{"text":"The service here is terrific!

The hostess was nice, the server was VERY attentive and she was an absolute dear!
The rest of the servers were friendly and always made sure to ask if we needed anything.

I've only been here once, but I truly enjoyed my experience here!"}
{"text":"Gotta have their signature sweet cream pancakes. Eggs are good but the pancakes are something special & extra thick bacon is ultra salty but savory. Worth the wait cause their is always a line especially on the weekend."}
{"text":"Black Bear is a good place for BIG Breakfast. Really enjoy the Grizzly it gives you a sample of everything. The sweet cream pancakes are delisious! DON'T FORGET THE HOMEMADE PIE ON YOUR WAY OUT."}
{"text":"Went back again today for late lunch. The food was great and plentiful. The service is terrific. Staff kept coming by to check on us. Many staff members spoke to us. Great job. This place is wonderful. Keep up the great work!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I frequent this restaurant quite a bit. Love the breakfasts- the bacon is the best! Great service and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"The infamous \"NiggaBilly\"gives you four stars. The service was outstanding above and beyond what you normally see. My only complaint with the food was there was too much of it and I hate wasting a good meal. The food was excellent..............Alright Baby!!!!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for real turkey +. I looked on YELP and remembered oassing by this place a number of times. So I decided to try it. I was greeted so warmly by Anthony, who showed me to my table and explained the menu to me since I mentioned this was my first visit. What a great menu too. Large and small choices and an amusing civer on the menu featuring 1962 themed fun facts and articles. How unique! That is all I had to say. Anthony's bubbly personality and charm just really impressed me. He even told me that they would be happy to offer me aome other veggie choices, not expressly on the menu. 
My turkey, garlic mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce and coleslaw even were presented very appealing and were delucious. Anthony checked on me numerous times and was just a pleasure.I asked to speak to the manager, I believe in acknowledging good employees.  Too many people are quick to point out the bad ones.While I was waiting,  I noticed a waitress walking by with a big smile. It turned out to be the supervisor, Marlene. She came by to ask me how everything was going and I told her how impressed I was with Anthony's service and attitude. She was very aware of how awesome he was. What a doll she was. Her face lit up as ahe told me how much she loved welcoming new guests and her job.  She got me a form to fill out to sign up for e-mails and offered to give me a free desert. These people know how to give great customer service. Next the manager Trinidad came by and sat down with me. He was fabulous too. He told me how he loved working for this company. He praised his staff also. He told me how they all loved to get to know their customers and hoped I would return.
What a great, warm place with delicious food, good prices, great value and a real family feel to it. In this town, that is very rare. I can't wait to return and order something from the all day breakfast choices. Sooo many restaurants and their staff could lessons from this place! I feel like I found a diamond in the desert."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM! I went here on a Sunday brunch with family for the first time! Let me just say, they made a great first impression! I loved all the breakfast food. Big portions though. So if you're someone who can't eat much, I suggest sharing with someone else! Also their biscuits are GINORMOUS but SOO GOOD!! 1 biscuit could be good for 2 people! But no one likes the top.. Haha! I would definitely go here again for Sunday brunch. Best diner I've ever been to!"}
{"text":"Fun little Bear themed comfort food diner.  I loved the Bear claw with almond filling. Great pastry that is actually shaped like the claw of a bear.  They also have some other creative scrambles and things.  Good service too."}
{"text":"Waited  over twenty minutes for the worst burger I have ever been served.  The thousand island dressing was so thick it made the bun soggy and too messy to eat."}
{"text":"I went here this morning for breakfast with the BF to use our living social deal. We had been to black bear before about 6 years ago in glendale and then again maybe 4 years ago up in Washington state. The last time we went, we were not terribly thrilled with the place. Anyway, we decided to give them another shot and it was pretty decent. I had the shasta scramble, which has avocado, onion, bell pepper, and spinach. This was good, it was not the most flavorful scramble I have ever had, but the veggies were fresh and I liked that this was an option on their menu because most places only have one veggie scramble and it has tons of veggies thrown in with no reason for those veg to go together...anyway, the breakfast came with a ton of country potatoes which I liked more than the typical hash brown. The BF got the one biscuit and gravy breakfast and he said it was alright, not the best ever, but not bad. I thought breakfast here was better than Denny's or Ihop, but clearly not as good as the Farmhouse or Liberty Market and the like of local breakfast places. The service was also good, but I thought it was so weird because our waitress kept calling us 'kids' and calling me sweetie, princess, and honey. I find this somewhat condescending, not that I think that was her intention, but I think that is unnecessary. I know this is kind of a diner thing, but I have never really cared for us, but maybe that's just me. The waitress was good at her job and attentive though, so that is what's important. Also, the portions are huge and I wish they had more options for half meals because I don't like to waste food, but I know people like the giant portion thing.... I would probably come back here for breakfast again sometime, however, because it is decently priced and has decent flavor."}
{"text":"The food is good but the girls and particularly the ones working Saturday morning on 4/25/2017 have some serious issues. We were seated and the girls places 1 set of silverware on the table where 4 people were sitting and then walks off. I asked 3 times for silverware and was ignored, I then asked the waiter and he walked off in a stupor, I then get upset and walk to the cashier and ask for silverware, the girl then grabs a big handful of silverware and drops it in the. Enter of the table and walks off. This is probably one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant in 45+ years.

All of the girls up front almost were acting as if they were on something or half asleep. Management never even reached out and tried to contact me to discuss my complaint, I don't think anyone cares about customer service here. This review is fir the location on Sahara and Durango."}
{"text":"My friend and I went there for lunch yesterday. Our waiter was not very nice almost sarcastic my friend ordered her sandwich not toasted with pepper jack cheese. Although the sandwich was asked to not be toasted it's SAT under the heat lamp for so long waiting for the waiter to pick it up that the lamp made the bread almost toasted. The sandwich did not have pepper jack cheese and he forgot my french fries. It took us 40 minutes to get her food after we ordered the table behind us it took them almost an hour. I would not recommend this for lunch our place to eat as you'll get back to work late. I think management should check into their servers and their attitudes towards the patrons. I  understand it can be stressful at times however my friend and I are always very polite to wait staff. This person was not friendly from the time we sat down"}
{"text":"First time here and it will be the last because of the customer service provided by our server Kenie. The food was good and the atmosphere was nice but probably would have enjoyed the experience if there was better customer service from Kenie. During the visit Kenie constantly rolled her eyes at us, would sigh, presenting with horrible body language and got really nasty when asking for her to take away some trash from the table. We were sitting right next to the server station and Kenie was complaining to another server that we were waiting for another member of our party. Completely unacceptable. Things got even better when the other members of my party tried to pay and leave. When we were at the register, Kenie flat out lied and told another server we were sitting at her table for three hours. Lets do some math. We were seated at 0936am, walked up to the register at 1051am. That is 1 hour and 15 minutes. Not 3 hours. I was so furious over the experience, I asked to speak to the manager. He was nice and apologetic about the experience. He offered free meal next time back and said he wished he knew about it as it happened. I told him it was really busy and tried to pass the behavior of Kenie off as being really busy, then he told me that they only work 4 tables. I guess we weren't eating fast enough for her liking. Actually contacted the cooperate office about this issue and will be waiting for a call back."}
{"text":"Great business...great customer service is hard to come by in Las Vegas & this place rules in customer service. One of my favorite local places for breakfast, the Cracked Egg is awesome also. Customer service is definitely better here though!"}
{"text":"Basically Denny's quality with larger portions...visiting family and was their choice, not something I would pick on my own. The server did ok with our large group although we were forgotten about a few times."}
{"text":"Great place, great food, great service... Manager check in on us, server Juvenal was great."}
{"text":"This is the second time I come to this diner and I just love it. I come from Henderson all the way here and it's so good, everyone is super friendly and at least both times I've been here they are very quick to seat you even when full and the food comes quick. A good big amount of food and a very decent price. Definitely gonna be a regular here!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat with amazing service, ask for April, she is awesome with a great smile all the time :). And the manager too :)"}
{"text":"3 words: Chicken Fried Steak! Treat yourself and order it! Most of the times I've been here it's been packed yet they still managed to seat me within a few minutes. When you combine great service, with great food, and huge portions - you've got a customer for life in me!"}
{"text":"Very nice concept and good idea to have bear novelties at the checkout counter.  The food is decent and does the job if your hungry.  Very friendly staff, even with the wait it didn't take long to get seated. 

The pineapple upside pancake was good,only weird part is my pancakes sat on a orange and piece of lettuce which makes no sense at all.  

Other then that had a good experience"}
{"text":"Heard a few good things about this place but not much publicity from my peers. Decided to try this place out and decided that I could describe it with one word - charming.

From the cute little (and some big) bears, to the waitresses in suspenders and classic diner hospitality, Black Bear Diner easily buttered me up before I even received my meal!

The vegetarian omelet I got was chock full of sautéed vegetables, much more than I had expected! The egg also had that standard fluffy quality. And the biscuits...They were massive! They were warm and fluffy and oh-so-delicious thanks to the fact that my date decided to get gravy on the side. On another note, the hash browns I had were my favorite to date and the corned beef hash was better than I've ever tasted.

We also got the banana cream pie, which was pretty good but not mind-blowing. It was sweet, creamy, and crispy in all the right places.

The best part? All that delicious food for a very reasonable price tag. When we left, the hosts even bid us loud and unabashed goodbyes! Charming."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! Their portion sizes are large and you certainly won't leave hungry. I highly suggest the bear claws. They are humongous and have a ton of filling."}
{"text":"Stayed in Vegas for 6 days and ate here 5 of them.  Service, ambience, and food were top notch.  Personal favorite-the pancakes.  Best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great Food, great service, great prices.

Found some healthy options that fit into my strict food choices.

I will be back at XMAS !!"}
{"text":"We always have a great time at Black Bear Diner! My Fiesta Omlet rocked and my husband loved his bear claw imprinted waffle!! The waitress had just the right amount of sass to make it fun fun fun! Since it was my biking group that dined there, it was a large group, but the staff didn't flinch and were treated like royalty!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed. The service was poor. There was not one time our server came to our table and did not apologize for something. Our meals were made incorrectly, our checks were split improperly, I was overcharged. Overall I would not eat there again. Mediocre."}
{"text":"We eat here as often as we can. Service always great and food is very tasty. I love the Patty Melt! Have been going there for years.  Recommend it to all."}
{"text":"A really great spot adjacent to the Orleans casino.Fast,friendly service and some really great breakfast food.Bacon Benedict and the spinach Benedict were nicely done and abundant.Short stack combo was also full of really nice ingredients..eggs,pancakes and bacon.April was a wonderful waitress for us.This is where Nevadans eat."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of Black Bear Diner and I am VERY happy to have them in the area.

As with any new business, they seem to be suffering some growing pains.  While the restaurant is spacious, clean and new, and the staff is all very friendly....The kitchen seems to be struggling a bit.

My Mom and I were shopping nearby and decided to stop in for a late lunch.  As we entered, we were greeted by the cashier, who was assisting other customers.  She said she would be right with us, but unfortunately had quite a long line.  Luckily, we were approached by one of the servers who sat us.  We were both very hungry and this is definitely the place to go if you have a large appetite!  The young lady who sat us also turned out to be our server, and she was very nice.

I ordered the French dip, with mushrooms, onions and Swiss cheese added. On the side were fries.  My Mom ordered the small CFS breakfast, with eggs and hash browns.  Neither of those items seem very complicated, but they took a REALLY long time to get.

We were seated near the kitchen, so I could see that there was a bit of chaos.  There was food being sent back for being the wrong order, food that sat in the window for a long time before being delivered, and servers all over the place.  This is somewhat expected when a new restaurant opens, so if you go to a place knowing this, you have patience.

We weren't disappointed with the wait.  Our food was piping hot and fresh and delicious.  One strange thing was that my mom received the large portion of the CFS, which she didn't order.  The waitress told her they didn't have the smaller portion, so she just brought her the big one.  That is fine, but it would have been nice if she checked with us first - maybe my Mom would've changed her order.

Everything was tasty.  As always, the CFS was crispy and flavorful (I stole a bite).  My French dip was also good, but nothing special.

When we got our bill, the waitress had charged us for the large CFS.  I almost feel like she was trying to sneak one over on us - we had to track her down (since you pay up front) and explain that it was wrong and we shouldn't be charged.  She apologized and had a manager fix it, and we were on our way.

While cashing out, we decided to buy and take home one of their small banana cream pie (my Mom's favorite dessert). At $5.99, it was decently priced and REALLY good.

I love that everything is branded as Big Bear Diner - the hot sauces are Mama Bear, Papa Bear and Baby Bear, based on hotness.

Overall, a great place that I look forward to returning to.  Small bumps in service are to be expected, but I am sure they will be running smoothly very soon."}
{"text":"I am SO glad that this place is so out of the way for me - although I am not a big breakfast eater, I absolutely love CFS (chicken fried steak)! I would definitely hit this place up more often if it were closer.

My Mom and I stopped in recently for a late breakfast on a Saturday afternoon.  This was my 2nd time dining there, and as much as I wanted to try something different, I couldn't help but order chicken fried steak.

They do a great job - it's a large portion, served with hashbrowns and eggs.  The patty is perfectly crispy and the gravy is delicious.

It's a busy place during peak breakfast hours (they are open through dinner as well).  I've noticed both times that the servers sometimes get a little overwhelmed.  Don't go if you are in a rush and you will leave happy!"}
{"text":"Nice place, we went and not too busy for them but we got great service, food was good also I love the pancakes over here. Definitely coming back to try more of there menu"}
{"text":"Went here on a busy Saturday morn, waited about 15 mins.. Atmosphere is welcoming with a log cabin interior.. Friendly staff and nice size restaurant for larger parties..Was going to order breakfast but the menu is so large, I changed my mind several times.. I wind up ordering a delicious club sandwich served with a mound of hot crispy fries..my husband ordered a meat lovers omelet served with the best hash browns and biscuit..my only complaint was they serve pepsi products and I am a Diet Coke fan!! Will definitely return soon!!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here this is our stopping point getting back into town waitress was very nice places always clean music was cool will definitely come here again"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here almost every weekend and it's perfect EXCEPT once in a while his pancakes are dry and I order my eggs over medium and they're runny and wet and gross, staff is always very nice overall a delish place to have breakfast. Bears choice is my favorite"}
{"text":"I have to give this place 5 stars. A few points deducted for lukewarm gravy on the country fried steak and outdated decor, but an otherwise perfect down home country diner meal. 

Three of us split a few dishes and here are the results. 
The sweet cream pancakes are the absolute best pancakes I have ever had. For reals. 
All of the egg dishes (chicken sausage scramble, over medium and scrambled) were perfectly cooked, well seasoned and just plain delicious. 
Large portions for nice prices. The biscuits were huge and fluffy. Even the fruit salad was sweet and fresh. 
The Chicken fried steak is a must try, even though I can generally take it or leave it. 
Our server was super sweet and attentive. 

Overall lovely experience and this place clearly knows what they are doing."}
{"text":"Pretty basic diner. They have the usual items on their menu..but their actual menu..is quite interesting! :P it's in the form of a newsletter. We thought that was pretty neat. We ordered the tri-tip sandwhich & a chicken caesar salad. Our server seemed to be in such a rush & did not give us the specials..maybe she was the one server that lacked customer service skills coz the rest of the staff seemed to be very friendly. Anyways, when our order came, our eyes grew so big! They serve pretty big meals!! One order is equivalent to two servings. We will definately come back."}
{"text":"Excellent service and decent breakfast on a Friday morning at 0630 . . . 

PROS: breakfast fare was good. I liked the hash browns, and the link sausages were very tasty and not too fatty. They offer egg beaters, which I prefer.  Food came to our table w/in 5 mins of placing our order. Our server, Janna/Jenna (?) was super friendly, efficient, and made sure we were taken care of from entry-to-exit. 

CONS: I must confess, I found the decor to be . . . a tad too . . . outdoorsy???

I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but we came here because they are one of the few places in the area open before 0700. Chow was okay, service was excellent.

Cheers!

{"text":"First off we were sat in the very back right corner of the restaurant and sat there for Several Minutes Unnoticed ! We were thirsty and hungry so Hangry to say the least   

Our table for four had a  Server came up probably was not told we were there by the ladies in the front.  Waiter was super nice got us drinks right away. 

I was Craving country food I didn't have to cook myself so the Country fried steak it was. I loved their season veggies so much and the taters are great but our favorite is that darn ranch on a salad ! I could live in that ranch. Swim in that ranch.  I'm thinking of you right now ranch   

Ok so besides the first several minutes everything else was great. We got two pies to go the chocolate silk and the banana ! I treated my two clients and my newest employee to some grub here and everyone was super happy!  The staff is always super sweet but that corner in the very back by the kitchen   I don't like .... never again! 

Otherwise great as usually for some good ol american grub"}
{"text":"Not outstanding, but definitely above average.  A little over the top with the bear decor, but a nice little diner amongst all the madness that is Vegas.  Went for an early Sunday breakfast and the place was almost completely empty... something that has happened this whole trip.  Promptly waited on and served.  Had the granola cakes, eggs and ham slice.  Generous portions and good overall quality.  Outstanding or amazing???  Not really.  Cakes were a bit heavy and still doughy inside.  Probably tough to pull off with them being that dense, but I would have like a bit more done inside.
Wait staff and owner was attentive (he checked on us during the meal).  Nice and friendly customer crowd as well."}
{"text":"Gary was our server and he was great! Definitely will be coming back in the future, food was good and not to pricy !"}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time on a Sunday after church. We had a small wait, but it was definitely worth it. The kids had breakfast and it was larger portions. We had burgers that were delicious and large portions as well. Good service and good prices. We will be back."}

But I asked for the club on the light menu and got a huge portion of fries and sandwich which was dry very little mayo on it. Which is why the rating. Also we were placed in the backend hard to get waitresses attention. Also asked for an Arnold Palmer and was also disappointed in it.
May give the Black Bear another try"}
{"text":"Went to Black Bear Diner for breakfast.  I had a Fiesta Scramble.  It was average.  Nothing unique here."}
{"text":"Now this place was off the hook, me and my wife enjoyed everything we had and if it wasn't for getting full off of what we had ordered I've would have ordered something more which I did I took home a dessert a bread pudding.So let me wrap this up so I can dig into it. Over all Great place,great experience and great service."}
{"text":"When I visit Las Vegas, I try not to eat on the Strip.  The main reason is the restaurants are overpriced, or its just another commercial experience.  For breakfast, Stephen and I have found many hidden gems located no more than 10-15 minutes from the Strip.  On this visit, I suggested coming to the Black Bear Diner located off Tropicana Avenue.

Black Bear is a restaurant chain that started in Mt. Shasta, California with locations in the western part of the United States, such as Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Utah, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho.

On weekends, they do get crowded, but fortunately we came on a weekday, and was seated right away at 9:30 am.  The restaurant is \"bear themed\" and the portions are lumberjack sized.  They do offer a a few menu items for seniors or those who are light eaters, and the portions are still very generous.

We had dinner plans at 7:00, so we didn't want to fill up with a huge breakfast.  We decided on the \"Mini Volcano\" which is 2 pancakes, bacon and/or sausage, plus an egg for $8.99.  The pancakes are made with a sweet cream, which I ate without syrup.  They reminded me of the taste of a fortune cookie, with a hint of vanilla.

Service was friendly, and there's plenty of free parking."}
{"text":"Review for pies only. 

I decided to pick up some pie for my friend's birthday. I searched yelp and surprisedly this was one of the better locations for pie. 

I decided to order three different pies. All the pies are not the average size pie that you get from Marie Calendar.  They don't come in an 9in pie pan, they are a lot smaller. I wasn't expecting that but in the end, I was happy cause it allowed us to try the other flavors. 

I ended up ordering the chocolate cream pie, banana cream pie, and apple cobbler. My favorite was the chocolate cream pie. I love this pie. It's so good. It's tasted like chocolate pudding with a chocolate cookie crust. It was so good. 

I can't wait for my next Vegas trip so I can pick one up and eat it all myself! No Sharing Here. Yum Yum Yum!"}
{"text":"Came in around 9 pm on a Thursday. Wasn't busy. Resturant was clean and we were sat quickly. The portions are large (we all got The Volcano) which is two eggs (more like 3 or 4) 3 large pancakes, bacon, sausage, the works. Food was made fast and was really tasty. The service was good. We mingled a bit, ( not sure of closing time) but we never felt rushed to leave. I don't live on this part of town, but if the opportunity presents itself, I would dine there again"}
{"text":"After getting food poisoning from here a few months ago we decided to give it another chance. (food poisoning was from salad)
One tip, do not forget to bring a sweater, it's always freezing inside.

So we went to check out the all u can eat fish fry.  The fries and fish had a burnt taste to them, they use paco crumbs instead of beer batter which tasted off.  We were not impressed.  The colesaw was lacking flavor and moisture. We won't be back for a long time."}
{"text":"Where do you go on Christmas Day when you had your Christmas dinner with your daughter the day before and you are on your own for the first time in decades? Answer a place with great tasting foods that you feel ultra comfortable? For me Black Bear Diner in Glendale, Arizona is that place.
They called their Christmas menu a limited menu...limited to great holiday platters that is! 
I had the oven roasted turkey dinner. Reminded me of Grandma Hanlin's Christmas celebration dinners and that is a true compliment! Thick turkey, mashed potatoes and gravy and a thought of my mother's green beans. Made with bacon and bringing back my dad ( a meat and potatoes guy), \"The only way I will eat green beans is with ham!\" So I wasn't alone on Christmas but was with my wife's family, and mine. Thanks for the memories Mama and Papa Bear!!"}
{"text":"Huge portions for a decent price and the atmosphere is vey family friendly. The kiddos loved their dishes and the awesome decor!"}
{"text":"Went there today 7-5-15 around 12:30 for lunch. I had the chicken & waffle with a root beer and the total was $15.76 after tax.  I would have given this place 5 stars for the food and 4 stars for the service but two things happened that irritated me. 
1) I asked for gravy and biscuits and never got them. They weren't on the bill and I watched our waitress write it down. So thanks for that. 
2) When the runner brought out the food it looked great but she said to me \"as soon as we have more fries made I'm going to bring you some\".  I asked why because there were plenty of fries on my plate and she said \"Ohhhh no honey that's not enough \". It struck me as bizarre ...she came back another time and asked if I got more yet...I told her no....and then she never brought more. It was just weird.  
  The waffle and the root beer were legit. I'd like to come back and try some pie one day. There's just something....\"off\" about this place."}
{"text":"OK, after a few days of eating average Vegas buffet food, we cruised over to the Black Bear Diner for breakfast and all I can say is that we totally screwed up... by waiting so long to try the Black Bear.  I had an order of chicken fried steak that was so tender and tasty that I could literally cut it with the fork.  Along with that, I had diced red potatoes with onions/peppers and a killer sweet-cream pancake.  My wife had the hobo omelet, hash browns and a huge homemade biscuit.  The daughter had a stack of the pancakes, eggs and bacon.  We were so stuffed that there was no way we could enjoy any dessert, so the wife got a bear claw to go.  Apparently that was pretty good too, since I never got a single bite of it...  The entire staff there is super nice and friendly (normal) people.  We'll definitely be back

(Might be in the running for best chicken fried steak ever...)"}
{"text":"Service was ok. Got seated as soon as we walked I'm but rarely came back to our table after that.

Ordered the steak and eggs. Steak was cooked correctly but was cold upon arrival. Flavor was ok. Hash browns were mediocre. Eggs were good. Pricey as well."}
{"text":"Just went to the BBD for the first time this morning. Food was very good. Service was very good. Price is high on some meals but overall a pretty good value. The coffee is pretty great. Hubby got the chicken fried steak. He said it was delicious. We will probably visit this establishment again."}
{"text":"I love Black Bear Diner! I love the ambiance. Bears, bears, bears everywhere! The decor is just so homey and warm. Great place for families. It's like Denny's but better. We ordered the Grizz (ham, sausages, bacon, 3 eggs, 2 pancakes, and side of either potatoes, hash browns, or fruit) and the Corned Beef (corned beef, 2 eggs, 1 pancake, and same side choices). Both were delicious. My favorite thing here are the pancakes - they are so buttery, light, and fluffy. In my opinion, they taste even better than IHOP's original stack. The pancakes here are like sweet pillow clouds that melt in your mouth. Everything else that I tried tastes like your standard breakfasts foods at a diner. But whenever I come here, I feel like I'm eating at Disneyland. The staff are friendly, the music is old school, and the decorations are quaint and whimsical. Even while you're waiting for your food, you can read the faux Bear Diner newspaper. Today, I learned about Henderson-made Titanium on the moon and moon cheese while waiting for our food."}
{"text":"Food is good, filled up the 3 men in our party (one was a 3 year old who saw his choc. chip pancakes and couldn't help but ooh and ahh).  My son and husband both had some hefty omelets and very nice looking hash browns while I was more than pleased with my fit and healthy egg white omelet, fruit and toast!

Staff was great-our waitress was wonderful.

Plus, our grandson was very impressed with all the wooden bears-especially getting to sit behind the tree of bears and see their \"tushies\"!"}
{"text":"I ordered the black bear claw, the menu said \"made fresh each day\" but I think they meant they opened a new package for each order, and from the taste of it not many people ordered it! Stale , dry and totally yucky, not to mention it has THE most calories on the menu, 1800+ for a single Danish! The only reason I gave 3 stars is the rest of the tables orders were ok and the waitress was really nice! She took the bear claw off the check no problems"}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever! Large portions, went twice during our stay on the strip... service is on point!"}
{"text":"My wife was excited to get a free birthday breakfast coupon. She was in the hospital and got out last Thursday, and it was ONE DAY after the expiration. The restaurant would not honor the free breakfast."}
{"text":"My favorite meal here is the meatloaf and mashed potatoes. Yes, the meatloaf. The turkey dinner isn't bad either. Stick to your normal Diner fair and you should be happy. As you would expect from a diner, very good coffee as well."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast. More food than any one person can consume. Nice employees and overall really clean for a quick casual breakfast joint. I would give it five except 1) sometimes on sundays they get over run by church go-ers and seniors and the service suffers a bit. 2) Once in a while the meats are a bit well done, but just give them a heads up if you don't like that and they'll be more conscious."}
{"text":"The service is great, the food is awesome, portions are huge, pies are delicious, the ambience is appropriate, the employees are friendly, and I do not know why this place is not a 5 star average! Because it should be!

Had the corned beef hash, and it's definitely not the canned stuff! 
The banana cream pie was a good end to our breakfast.
Going to be a regular from now on!"}
{"text":"This place has got potential. 

I did quite enjoy their chili w/ cornbread muffin. Nothing really special but I enjoyed it nonetheless. 

Pie wasn't anything special to me. Crust was hard and it was a pain to eat. 

I did get the Grizz on my first visit but ehhhhh. I'm gonna try the country fried steak next time. 

In terms of service, it's not too shabby but not exceptional either."}
{"text":"This place has delicious breakfast! We have tried several menu breakfast platters and they have all been really good. Exceptional chicken friend steak with country gravy and the sausage seemed homemade! Grandson and hubby are constantly after me to order"}
{"text":"It was a year ago since i've been to Black Bear since I was just visiting in AZ. I ordered the steak for breakfast and it was fantastic. My bf and friend's orders were delicious as well. The food tasted great and when the bill came, I was shocked because it was half as much as I expected it to be."}
{"text":"Great food and great service, a favorite spot for miles around.  The orange juice really is fresh squeezed and you get nice portions without sacrificing quality. 

The diner is very clean and food comes out quick and hot."}
{"text":"The sausage hash skillet with jalapeños! The pancakes! The atmosphere! We LOVE it. I always go back. The coffee could be better but it's still good enough. Too many things to eat nom nom nom!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Been here twice for dinner & I always tell people about it. I love the diner experience & this one is near perfect. I've ordered the Fish & Chips and also the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. Both delicious and with generous helpings. The corn bread is yummy with the butter. The blackberry pie was AMAZING also has the chocolate cream which was ok not good not bad. One of the waitresses is funny & always talks & jokes with you but I forgot her name (shame on me). Booths are kinda small but then again I'm 6'2 so for a smaller framed person it should suit you just fine. Can't wait to go back again but this time for breakfast"}
{"text":"This is the closest restaurant to my dads in Vegas.

Apparently it's a chain that started in big bear. 

Maybe it would be a lot more appealing if there were snow covered mountains outside and our legs ached from skiing too long and all we wanted was hot cocoa to relax. 

Unfortunately it's not... It's in Vegas. Totally random. 

With that said, it's sort of a family tradition. And the waiters are nice! See you there?"}
{"text":"Always delicious! My husband and I ate at one of their locations in California and were excited to try Goodyear. It wasn't much different, slight menu changes. We've tried breakfast, lunch and dinner and are never disappointed. Good service and the food comes our very fast. Love the hot sauces. We bought our own to take home. Great dessert options. Always big portions. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"First time stopping in at a Black Bear Dinner, but we will be back. Breakfast was great and fast. I had the California Bacon Eggs Benedict. It was great and the eggs and bacon were perfect. I opted for the hash browns to go with it. My hubby got the Bear's Choice breakfast with the sweet cream waffle. He was praising how good the bacon was and the waffle. (And he knows both pretty well.) pricing was comparable with other breakfast places and the portions were very large. I loved the \"theme\" that was present through the entire place. We came around 0800 on a Wednesday and there was No wait. The food came out hot and fast."}
{"text":"This place is okay and thats where it stops. If yubwant general comfort food, no frills, portions that challenge your cholesterol and your wasteband this is your jam. The Apple Bearclaw was great!!!!!"}
{"text":"From the second we walked thru the door we were treated nicely. Our waitress Trina, if I'm remembering that correctly, was a doll. When she came to our table she asked if we had ever been to the diner before. Well, no we haven't, this was our first visit. She went over the menu and pointed out some of her favorites. Then took our drink orders and gave us time to make our decision. While we waited for our food to come up, I was checking out what everyone else was eating, of course! But, it turns outs, what stood out the most was how polite and friendly all the staff was being to everyone. Customers walked in the front door while the Hostess was seating other guests and a busboy and a waiter said \"Hello, welcome to Black Bear!\"  The people here don't seem to just work, they seem to work as a team. 

Our food came out hot, looking and smelling great! I had the Grizz, which really is a lot of food. It's 2 good sized sweet cream pancakes, 3 scrambled eggs, 2 slices of bacon, 2 sausage links, a piece of ham steak and hash browns. My guy got the chicken fried steak and 2 eggs over easy, with country potatoes and a HUGE tasty biscuit. Yummy!  Notice what happened here??  YEP!  I got to try a BUNCH of stuff. LOL! 

Our waitress asked if we wanted dessert.  Ummm NO!  We were stuffed full. But, we will go back just for pie sometime. Everything in the case looked really appetizing, and of course I love pie.                        

I know this is a chain, but I'm happy to say that it felt like I was really eating at a local diner."}
{"text":"Im a waffle house kinda guy,

But this place has some damn good food and its cheap too.
You cant go wrong with the chicken fried steak with some tabasco. Their hashbrowns are good too nice and crispy.

Definitely my go to breakfast spot in Vegas.

They need to get grits on the menu though!"}
{"text":"Heard so much and read the reviews on Yelp, so I had to try it. Ordered the Turkey Dinner after confirming that they slice the turkey themselves. I got 2 small slices of round 1 1/2\" thick turkey that I could not cut with my husbands steak knife. It came with potatoes and a white gravy that had no flavor. I showed the waitress that I could not cut my turkey and it was like a super overcooked pork chop. she did not seem surprised and just took the plate and offered me a piece of pie. They did remove the dinner from my check, but I was left hungry. We had to stop for me to eat on the way home. 

I try to be very open about places, but I won't go back."}
{"text":"Welcome to the westside community, The Black Bear Diner is an asset for breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert dining. The diner looks great from the outside and is warm and friendly on the inside. 

Generous service. Upon greeting, we felt the friendly reception. Thank you Jeff, our table's server,  for the attention and accurate service this Tuesday morning. The kitchen staff needs a round of applause for the fast and immediate preparation of our pancakes, bear claw, fruit bowl and Fit and Focused Scramble. 

Generous portions. Bring a friend to share these huge plates or a basket to carry the to go boxes. The children could easily share a meal as well. 

Generous  hospitality.  There was a birthday celebration with a group sing along and sundae. Our drinks were filled and refilled quickly. We were checked on and attended to. Note: fresh OJ is not a complimentary refill.

Our family was provided cheerful service and kindness. Next time, I want us to sit at the traditional diner counter. I appreciate the Tomato Ketchup with no high fructose corn syrup! There is not a Family Bathroom but the large stall in the women's restroom has a baby changing table. The soap dispenser is difficult for children to reach. Watch out for hot water from the sink tap, the faucet is not automatic. The paper towel dispenser is a No Touch system."}
{"text":"Great home style diner! Very friendly atmosphere and outstanding grub! Size of the plate is HUGE! Ordered the hash and it was delicious. Would highly recommend if you need that fill up before the long journey back to CA"}
{"text":"We wanted something for dessert and decided to stop by. The reason for the 3 stars is because It took a little while for them to sit us at our table. The service was a bit slow, maybe because it was close to closing time. The desserts we ordered were very delicious and we enjoyed them over coffee."}
{"text":"My new favorite place! I just love their bigfoot Chicken fried steak and eggs (scrambled) with extra crispy hash brown and pancakes! And then their coffee! Soooo good. I went twice in a matter of 3 days. Lol... The servers are really nice and helpful. Always ready to help whenever we have questions or asking for recommendations. They never rush us. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Pancakes are so good you won't even want to put butter and syrup on them!  Service was great.  This place is the real deal."}
{"text":"Best Black Bear Diner my Husband and i evet ate service was excelent the food was great . Kept with tradition . Well will definitely go back there again . mmm good."}
{"text":"The good is decent here and the service is good (for how busy they always are). But I came in here for one main reason. I've been to the place about 4 different times. Every single time I've been there they have the air conditioning in FULL BLAST! You will notice as soon as you step in the front door that it is cold. Twice I have been seated at tables where the cold air is blowing directly on our table. I hear other customers also making comments about how cold it is. Warning: Don't come in here without your winter jacket. As they don't seem to care if their customers are comfortable or not. I will think twice about coming in next time if I have nothing to warm myself up with. I would have given this place 4 stars otherwise."}
{"text":"I've had worse. Order was messed up more than two times and the workers socialize more than actually work."}
{"text":"I love coming to black bear diner.  My mom actually calls the place her favorite restaurant.  

The wait (even when there's a crowd) is never crazy long.  We usually come at 10 or 11 on Sundays and only wait around 15 minutes at the longest. 

The food is always good and very plentiful.   Watch out because the portions are huge so don't over order (unless you're my mom and love to squirrel away biscuits.)

Sometimes we get small problems like forgetting something we ordered or something not being cooked right but it's rare and it always gets solved quickly.

I really appreciate that the manager comes by as well to make sure everything went ok.   

Definitely the spot to be to get a great breakfast."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to see a Black Bear up close, but I have yet to meet any bears dining at the notorious \"Black Bear Diner.\" According to Wikipedia, the American Black bear can grow to upwards of 500lbs, which is roughly the weight you will put on after eating one of the biscuits here. 

There are a few statues of bears both inside and outside the restaurant, which really adds to the Jungle Book sort of atmosphere. I don't know which bear is Baloo, but I'm sure he would agree that their breakfast items should be part of the \"bare necessities.\" I'm sure there's another joke here, but that is literally the extent of my knowledge on The Jungle Book.

The chicken-fried steaks are especially good, and I usually order about 20 of them. They are great as comfort food, but even better for fighting off a nasty hangover: by the time I'm shitting out steak number 16, my anus hurts way too much for me to be worried about some damn headache.

The hashbrowns are literally the best use of a potato that exists. If I could grow their hashbrowns directly from the ground instead, I would do it in a heartbeat. Last month I had a plate of their hashbrowns and I didn't poop for a week because my body refused to let it leave."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, folks are super friendly.  Come hungry, portions are huge but you can get smaller portions too.  I love that they \"encourage \" sharing."}
{"text":"We went to this diner as a larger group of 9. Five of us ordered medium steaks or ribeye and all of them were well done. Such a bummer and because it took so long we didn't want them to go back. The cornbread was delicious. My kids got pancakes and they unfortunately were hard although they were large. The salads was boring. It was lettuce, carrots, tomatoes and the dressing. We also had both soups at our table -chicken noodle and cream of mushroom- both were from a can. Our waitress was nice and attentive, but I think her supervisor was rude when seating us. The place could use a good deep cleaning."}
{"text":"First meal and review of 2016 and its not a good start. After eating at the westside location and enjoying the sweet cream waffle, the manager there told me to try the chicken fried steak. I love chicken fried steak! My quest in Vegas is to always find a great chicken fried steak, and .... sadly....not many places can do it right.

The chicken fried steak I had here at BBD was not good. Overcooked, small, crunchy, flavorless gravy....nothing good about this one. Won't be ordering that again.

The place was packed, 45 minute wait for a table. As a single I was able to procure a counter space quickly. Service is fast and friendly, food came out fairly quick considering the massive amounts of orders. And maybe that's why the Chicken Fried Steak was lacking, due to heavy volume. 

I'll be back because its close, but will not order this again."}
{"text":"We ended up at Black Bear Diner after visiting two other restaurants with extremely long waits. We were immediately seated and then waited. And waited. Finally the manager, who seated us, noticed us still sitting and promptly took our drink order and reminded the waitress that was responsible for us. After the unfortunately long wait everything was great. Three ordered the fish fry platter and one ordered a sandwich. The fish platter was plentiful and very good. Due to the long wait they gave us a free dessert (one can easily feed 4 people) and also took our drinks off.  Since they were very apologetic and rectified the mistake we will definitely be back to Black Bear Diner."}
{"text":"I thought I'd been here before, but when I walked in I realized I hadn't. Nice little cafe style place was bustling on a Saturday around noon. I was quickly seated and brought an iced tea while I perused the menu. They offer breakfast, lunch and dinner, all comfort style foods in large quantities.

I order a Bear special breakfast, which gives you several options. I had 2 eggs over easy, bacon, and a sweet cream waffle. The bacon is thick sliced and smoked, and very flavorful. The sweet cream waffle was light and fluffy, and delicious. One of the best I've ever had. Only thing lacking was the ice tea, a bit weak.

Service was fast and friendly. This is a great place for a decent breakfast. I need to try their chicken fried steak next."}
{"text":"If I could give NO stars, I would.  Based on all of these reviews, we decided to give this place a try tonight as thought it might be a good mom and pop/diner place.  So, we sit down and literally, my hand gets stuck to the table.  When we call over a server to get a rag to clean the table, we are told that \"the breakfast crew must not have cleaned the tables\" so I guess they were disgusting during all of breakfast then the lunch shift as well as who ever was there before us for dinner?? Not buying it.  I tried the chicken fried steak as everyone seems to recommend it and I will say that who ever thinks this is the best they've ever had, have you ever been any where else??  I am very sorry but the gravy was a basic mix with no flavor AT ALL other than a pound of salt.  My husband had the Tri-tip dinner, all four little pieces of it for a whopping $17, and it had absolutely been microwaved as it was HORRIBLE!  No one ever came back to see if we were ok, until the end when our server came back with the check.  We told her that this was our first and would be our last time in.  She said she was sorry and we told her it was not her fault, just who ever was cooking in the back.  Sorry folks, I am starting to wonder if anyone has taste buds in this city as cannot even believe you would recommend this place!  I am sure I will need 100 bottles of water just to wash down the salt consumed."}
{"text":"this place was a nice escape from the unBEARable hot temp outside. 

who ever owns this store has a serious problem.  there are bears everywhere.  like fur reals.  they are all watching you while you eat.  they all seem friendly, except for some of the ones giving you the death look.   i was even afraid to use the restroom because i thought there might be bears staring at my junk and i couldn't bear another pair of eyes staring at me while i pee.  no thank you... 

this place is kinda out of the way, but it was crowded.  this is how you know a place is decent when you have to go out of your way to get the food and its still crowded...  

with the help of yelp, i ordered the country fried steak.  i felt like it was the staple of the restaurant.  it was really filling.  if you're hungry, there's also the bigfoot portion as well.
the fried steak was delish.  so were the eggs and hashbrowns.  make sure you use their hot sauce on the hash and eggs.  uhhh, makes my mouth water just thinking about it.  the toast were also buttered!!

they also have desserts! pies, ice cream and shakes.  next time i'm in vegas, i'll pay this place a visit... thats fur sure.  

/puns."}
{"text":"Never had bad service until today. We got seated fairly quickly, the bus server got us our drinks then 35 minutes later I finally asked the gentleman in the red shirt if we had a waiter, he then proceeded to find someone. Then the waiter that came to our table proceeded to tell us our table wasn't part of his section but he will take our order. Meantime no one asked us if we wanted refills or checked on us at all, we had to ask if we could have refills on our drinks. 
Maybe service is better during the week when it's not so busy."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been to a Black Bear and I must say that I'm a fan. I went on a Sunday morning at around 10:30 am and there were already people outside waiting to get seated. After about a 20 minute wait, we were seated. The decor was pretty neat and reminded me of being in a rustic log cabin in the woods. We ordered the bigfoot chicken fried steak and eggs combo which was definitely enough for 2 people. Unless your name is Kobayashi or Joey Chestnut, I don't know how one can finish this without feeling nauseous. Not to say that the food isn't good (it IS) - the portion size is that enormous. The chicken fried steak was great and the coating was perfectly crisp. The gravy was a bit thick and a tad too salty for my liking, although it wasn't bad. Country potatoes came with grilled onions and peppers and were quite good. Scrambled eggs - well, they're pretty standard and nothing special. Since we also wanted something sweet in addition to savory, we were able to substitute the included biscuits for 4 generous slices of french toast for no additional charge (SCORE!). The french toast was cooked perfectly - slightly crispy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. It had powdered sugar on top and came with a side of butter and syrup. I'm normally not the biggest fan of breakfast, but I would come here so long as my arteries and heart can take a beating."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times, I can't believe I haven't reviewed Black Bear yet! This is me and my friend's \"go-to\" breakfast place. Ginormous portions, and for a decent price. A little slow on the service, but if you're not in a hurry it's no big deal. Basically down home cooking. You see diner and that is exactly what you get. Good eats!"}
{"text":"My son and I went for breakfast we where sitting at the counter we saw are breakfast was next to be served my son order french toast the waiter was putting powdered sugar on his french toast the sugar fell on the counter the waiter with his bare hands wiped the sugar into hands from a dirty  counter and put it on my sons french toast if we where not sitting there at the counter to see what happened the waiter would have served that to my son"}
{"text":"Food was just ok. The hostess up front \" Michelle\" was one of the rudest people I have ever encountered at a restaurant. She had an attitude from hell.

The manager didn't seem to know what to do and she continued her tyrade.

**Waiter Jonathon did a nice job and was a nice dude.

This is still a customer service industry people - they lost my entire families weekly business for good."}
{"text":"We first discover this diner when we were doing road trip up north with my family & some relatives. Luckily, it was just right next to our hotel that we stayed in so we just walked & explore this convenient, clean & cozy atmosphere of this diner. We found humongous selections of hearty and delicious breakfast & other different menus. It was that great experience so when I saw they have various branches all over, I made sure that we'll go & eat again at their Vegas branch. I'm fascinated with their newspaper like menu lists. It's unique, absolutely great service & of course food is amazing! I highly recommend! It feels at home!"}
{"text":"Worst service. They had us wait over an hour when they said the wait would be 30-40 min. Once seated we were ready to order from looking at the menu during the wait. The waitress was doing her best to keep track. Waitress comes back and let's us know our food is about to come out but that they ran out of pasta for my brothers gf so she needed to pick something else. She opted for nothing since our plates started coming out and she didn't want to get her plate when we were pretty much done. The plates started coming out but there were things missing that we had to request/remind them about. The food didn't make up for the awful wait and service. The waitress seemed to be understanding, except at the end when she brought the bill and said, \"oh I took the pasta out of the bill for you guys.\" Well of course, we never got it . Guys, spare yourself the trouble and just head to iHop/Denny's."}
{"text":"I am a regular at another black bear restaurant in Vegas but visited this one today for the first time.  Was served coffee had to wait about 10 minutes after they dropped the coffee off for creamer. Ordered my regular steak and eggs fried hard. Steak medium well. Eggs were served to me over medium steak well done hashbrowns were old and dry. Sent the eggs back waitress Cynthia seemed offended by me sending the eggs back. My sisters pouched eggs one was perfect the other completely over cooked. This location should do egg preparation training a morning cook must know how to properly cook an egg."}
{"text":"Long wait times, possibly depending on the date and time, but hey, aren't most small, but good restaurants that way?  There wouldn't be long wait times if the food was bad.  The food here is A-MA-ZING (if you like a more traditional southern style of food) and the portions are HUGE (they put more on your plate than grandma at Thanksgiving)!    I've been three times in a month and the only complaint I have is that our server was a bit neglectful because he was so busy during one visit.  But honestly, I watched their order board for the kitchen clear twice in less than an hour during the dinner rush.  They have it facing outward where all of the customers can see it.  It made me appreciate the kitchen staff that much more!  It can be pricey, so plan on sharing a meal if on a budget, but it shouldn't be a problem because portions are enormous.  The decor is great, the staff is friendly, and takeout is a great option to avoid seating wait times."}
{"text":"This place is very good service and food. The staff really know how to make newcomers feel very welcome and feel like they care about their customers. The waitresses are very in tune with their tables and interaction with their guests.  The food is good also the portions are enough to usually feed two people. I would recommend them they have a few locations around the area. We visited the one on Durango, it's their newest location and I think it was good and the service is great will go back again for sure. And will bring others to visits there and try their foods!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had spent a good 10 hours moving into our new house and were starving. We came walking into this place looking like we had been up all night rolling in the dirt. They sat us in a room off to the left. Bad idea. When you walk into this place you look to the right and it looks like a lovely, clean restaurant. Then you look to the left and it looks like a dirty  crack den. Since we weren't looking that great ourselves I just figured this is where they seat the riff raff.  We were seated at a table that was within arms reach of all the brooms and mops. It was disgusting. We should have walked out then but we were just to tired and hungry. Kathy was our server and Wow what a gem she is (sarcasm). In a ruff biker bar off Route 66 she would probably fit right in but in a neighborhood dinner she just isn't a good fit. She acted pissed off and kind of rude. I ordered the California burger and my husband had the crispy chicken wrap. The one saving grace was that our food was delicious. It was hot, well cooked and generous portions. I will be back I'll just make sure I get seated to the dinning room towards the right next time."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a while now and the man in the front is awesome!  So friendly and inviting.  This place gets pretty packed on a Sunday afternoon but the turn over is pretty quick.  

I usually come here for breakfast items, but will occasionally have a burger when I feel like it.  Food is a-ok but definitely had better breakfast at almost half the price.  The pancakes are fluffy and moist, which is a super plus.  I like their classic cheese burger too.  Everything else is pretty standard, but i must add that i haven't ventured off to their dinner items.  Portions are huge and that's not necessarily always a good thing.  A bit excessive if you ask me; if you're not too hungry sharing would be wise.

Service is whatever.  I'll occasionally get a really friendly waitress who's personable and sweet, and then one who's rushed and without much personality.  

This morning i had the latter.  I was craving French toast and noticed all they had were cinnamon French rolls (their take on French toast).  I asked the waitress about it and she suggested it as being really delicious.  I took her word for it and left it at that because she seemed slightly impatient.  I would not recommend this dish!!!  It was cold, dry, too sweet, and hard.  It reminded me of a failed attempt at a Cinnabon.  I took a bite, put it to the side and shared my BFs omelet.  I actually really did try eating it though. 

Waitress comes up, asked if we needed a box, I said no, and she asked whether I liked my dish.  I said no, she hesitated about whether she should drop my check or possibly take my uneaten meal off of it. She decided to drop the check and went on her way.  Whatever.  The food wasn't expensive, but I definitely wasted $10 because I couldn't bring myself to eat that crap dish!!

Anyway, overall this place is a-ok.  

Will I be back?  Yes.  Not anytime soon that's for sure.

I'm definitely passing on the cinnamon french roll next time and I'll pass on that waitress too.


I must add that their coffee is delish! =)"}
{"text":"No, no, and no.
The service here is AWFUL. We ordered and nearly 45 minutes later food comes out over cooked, dried out and cold.
Place was not busy, there is no excuse for this. 
Our \"server\" Bernard needs to find a new line of work. The service industry is not for him. He was no where to be found, so my guess is he forgot to ring in our food then when he did ring it and it was ready he forgot again and it sat in the window to die. 
Being in this business I can be patient and understanding when there is reason, there was no reason for this. We sat and watched people come in after us, Order and eat then leave before we ever got our food. 
Needless to say we didn't even stay for a remake, I refuse to waste another hour watching pure incompetence and never getting a hot fresh meal.
So my advice is to avoid this place, unless you want to waste a whole day waiting for crappy food while dealing with bad service."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast and it was great specially very family friendly!!! However the reason they are getting 5 stars is because of how incredibly friendly the staff was!!!   They treated us and our 3 young children like we have. even coming here forever."}
{"text":"If you want to have delicious food that is home made and taste so good. Please try Black Bear! This was my first time here and I was not disappointed. I love breakfast and Black Bear is my new breakfast spot! I highly recommend you try it. I waited for 15 min. Be prepare to wait, but it's well worth the wait. The staff was friendly and I received my food right away.. Great service.... I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Yum! Good old fashioned breakfast at a reasonable price. You get a lot of being for your buck here. I ordered the mini-volcano with the harvest pancakes. The meal was good, but pancakes were literally falling apart. They may need to perfect that recipe a little more. We had good service too, my coffee never got cold and our waiter was very polite. Overall it was a good experience and we will be returning."}
{"text":"Being an Arizona native, walking into Black Bear Diner the first time was a surprise.  Whoa.  Did I get transported to Redding, California or something?  It was like we stepped out of the concrete jungle of Goodyear and into a log cabin in the woods.  Hansel, get Gretel out of the oven!

I've visited this location for the past five or six years and the food is always great whether you come for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  The portions are generous and the food is always brought to you hot.  The chicken fried steak is one of my favorites and the chicken pot pie is pretty solid too.  I haven't tried their tempting desserts since I'm always beyond-stuffed by the time I'm finished with my meal but they got a delicious maltshake.  Malts... so much better than regular milkshakes!

Black Bear Diner is a cute rustic-looking eatery with friendly service and good food.  Come and give them a try!  I'd take BBD over Denny's and IHOP any day."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We had breakfast and the Bigfoot had a delicious country fried steak. I had the homemade country sausage mild which was delicious. The best however was the bear claw and pancakes, simply the best I've ever had. Great waiter too, Mike P. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love love love coming here for breakfast! It's one of my fav spots for biscuits and gravy! My kids both love their pancakes too! They are delicious and don't fall apart like IHOP's.
This place would be 100x better if they weren't CRAZY packed most the time. Even when they are packed the service is usually really great anyway."}
{"text":"It's my favorite place to njoy  breakfast. I was just there last Sunday and my experience was way better than before (even though I have no complaints whatsoever) customer service went beyond all of my expectations thanks to Sidney. She did an amazing job always since the beginning, during and till the last minute we were sitting on that table. I requested the manager and her at the same time because I'm sure managers most of the time are called when there is a  problem and or a complaint. I had to let her know how great customer service was thanks to her and she did her  job perfectly fine with a big real smile on her face always . I highly recommend this place, Thank u Sidney."}
{"text":"Its okay, def doesnt stand out. Just a typical diner with decent food. Not bad but def not the best."}
{"text":"Love this place! Esp when I'm starving or take a friend and split something.  Huge portions, yummy food and great staff!  Plus no one bitched about my service dog!"}
{"text":"The Black Bear Diner is a solid place for breakfast.  We've been to another Black Bear Diner and were happy with it, so we decided to try this one based on other Yelp reviews.   

I was there late on a Monday morning for breakfast with 5 other people.   We were seated quickly and the service for the rest of the meal was well paced and attentive.   All 6 of us ordered different items and we all were quite happy with our selections.   The food was good and hit the spot.   

This place hit the spot for a great breakfast place.   The food was good, the service was good and the price was reasonable.   Good job folks.   Will I be back?   Sure I will."}
{"text":"I struggled with giving Black Bear 3 or 4 stars because I had two VASTLY different experiences. I decided to go with 4 though because in the end I can say I'll return - just in a more planned trip!

So my very first experience, we went on a Saturday late morning. They were busy, but not packed. Our server was friendly, helpful, efficient & enjoyable. Our food was hot & delicious. Most notably was the Big Bear burger (may not have the name exactly right, but it's the biggest burger on the menu) that my Mom got with bacon & no bun. Really, really good. We were so impressed that we turned right around & went again on Monday evening before my Mom went back to MN. It was like night & day!! The server was all over the place, inefficient, unfriendly & seemed quite clueless. We asked if the Mac & Cheese on the kids menu was Kraft (we have a rule of not paying $5 for 1/2 cup of what only costs .98 for an entire box) & she told us no, it was hand made.  We were very angry when she then delivered COLD Kraft to our table. :0/  The rest of our food was just warm & not nearly as well prepared as the first time we went. Nothing note able or memorable. I mean the difference in the 1st visit to the 2nd was like the difference between Kiss the Cook & Denny's. I was very surprised. But it's a good thing the bad time wasn't our first visit or I wouldn't bother going back. 

As it stands I WILL go again - but only during their busier breakfast times."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for breakfast! Friendly staff, very good food, and large portions so come hungry. Our server Abel was great!"}
{"text":"We stopped here one night and we did not know what to expect. Being our first time my husband ordered breakfast and I had a salad, it was pretty big just look at how nice it looked! I was surprised at how big it was.
Its decorated cute with bears and the service was very good.
Its a diner and the food was pretty good. We keep saying we will go back sometime but there is so many places we still want to try in Vegas. But if you see this place stop they have a lot to pick from."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a couple of times.  Staff is friendly and you are seated promptly.  Food is a little bland.  I think that's why my parents always want to go here.  Good portions for value."}
{"text":"Great breakfast if you're looking for a bunch of food!  We got pineapple upside-down pancakes and a linguica/scrambled eggs/hash browns/biscuits and gravy combo - bam - everything was awesome. Linguica (spicy Portuguese sausage) is a personal fave, and most places don't have it - props for that! HUGE, fluffy biscuit, OK gravy, that oddly, the biscuit made up for (never thought I'd say that)

The hash browns were savory and a great crunch:soft ratio, and the eggs great as well - perfectly cooked. The pancakes, thick, filled with warm pineapple chunks, topped with syrup and whipped cream, a perfect counter to all the savory stuff.  Washed down with a huge mug of diner coffee, and a waiter who made a joke about smoking pot once every 5 minutes, a great breakfast.  Thanks, BB!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch with my grandmother at this establishment for the first time. Everyone we interacted with was very friendly. The waiter and waitress were attentive and accommodating. The decor is very homey and makes the place feel cozy. The corned beef I ordered was a little overdone but I give it a pass because it wasn't the mushy canned stuff served at other restaurants! Will likely return."}
{"text":"We were pretty stoked to learn that this location opened up in our neighborhood. Had breakfast there this morning and, as always, it was great. Forgo the usual corporate chains and come here! I also need to mention that our waiter, Andrew, was excellent (and that's a lack of a better way of saying it, he was so rad.)  Take note Tempe BBD: he's definitely an asset to your restaurant. I'd be certain much of the staff is as great too. 5 stars all the way round for Tempe BBD!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Fast friendly service. Food is great, full menu served all day which is great if you want breakfast for dinner."}
{"text":"My husband saw an advertisement for the Black Bear Diner and suggested that we check out their biscuits and gravy.  We arrived there a little after 10 AM and were seated immediately at the counter (we're counter people).  We both ordered \"Bear's Choice\" (we selected 2 eggs, 2 biscuits & gravy, 2 slices thick-cut smoked bacon).  We both ordered our eggs over medium and were very specific about the need for the whites to be completely firm, but the yolks runny (this is how medium eggs are supposed to be).  We also ordered an extra side of gravy.

It wasn't long before our food was brought out.  It looked wonderful, and the portions were HUGE.  We checked our eggs, and to our dismay, the whites were still liquid and runny.  The server said they would correct the eggs and took the plates away.  A short while later, our plates were returned with correctly cooked eggs, so we settled in to enjoy.  

I was doing fine with the eggs and the bacon, when I tried a fork full of the biscuit covered in gravy.  There was absolutely no flavor at all to the gravy - I mean AT ALL.  We tried adding salt and pepper, but it was useless.  We waited for a good while for our server to check back with us, but finally gave up and decided to go eat elsewhere.  The experience was ruined - the gravy was what the dish was about.  We went to the front and got in line to request and pay our check (our server never brought it).  

When we were trying to pay, there was difficulty with the credit card reader, so the manager came over to take care of us.  As she was about to run the card, she smiled pleasantly and asked how everything was...  We shared our thoughts about the meal and I asked if anyone bothered to taste the gravy that day and mentioned that they might have some quality control issues.  She listened, seemed genuinely concerned, and was very apologetic about our experience.  She then indicated that she could not let us pay for the food.  My husband and I both objected but she gave my husband his credit card back and would not take it again.  She indicated that she was going to go to the kitchen to taste the gravy herself since clearly something was out of order.  She just asked that we return to try dining there in the future.

 In retrospect, I appreciate the manager's attention, and handling of the situation, but the eggs, and then in addition the gravy ruined our entire visit - and we had driven well beyond our zip code just to eat there.  We may return in the future, and if we do, I sincerely hope that I can write a revised review.  Our experience was in June and I hesitated to publish this review torn between how bad the food and service were, and how the well manager handled the situation.
I didn't take writing this review lightly."}
{"text":"This place wasnt bad, but they werent good really, either. I had an Asian salad wrap that was good but too much dressing made it fall apart and it was difficult tomeat. My friends had the open-faced hot beef sandwich and mashed potatos. She liked it alot and said the bread tasted sweet. My other friend had a cclub and cup of chili. Again, he loved the bread but the chili was luke warm and it came with the worst corn bread Ive ever tasted. Very dry. Service was decent enough as well."}
{"text":"I have been to The Black bear diner in Long Beach many times before. So I decided to go to the Black Bear in Gilbert since I was in Arizona visiting my daughter. Upon entering, we were a bit confused since there was not a hostess to seat us. It seems the way they have it to work is whichever waitress or waiter is available seats incoming customers. A bit confusing at first and causes servers to shout across the restaurant.  Hah, kinda funny.  
    When we were seated and presented the menu, I was pleased to see that it was basically identical to the menu in Long Beach.  We both ordered almost exactly the same breakfast.  We both have a real soft spot for chicken fried steak and eggs.  The steaks were the real deal;  not a patty but sirloin tenderized, egg battered and deep fried to a golden brown.  It was as it should be the best of the meal.  My eggs were as ordered and hash browns were, well, hash browns.  I got mine with a biscuit and it was huge.  Biscuitzilla about as big as a quarter of a loaf of bread. It was good, but no way would I try to finish it.  The gravy was good but I was hoping for very good.  Service was super, attentive and friendly.  Try the Bear for breakfast.  I think you will like it.  They also serve lunch and dinner which is also well done comfort food."}
{"text":"We have been here before but only for breakfast, so this time we wanted to try the dinner menu. 

As with everything here you never leave hungry, big portions and the food is quality. The tri tip was delicious and tender and the green beans are awesome(mmmmm bacon!)  
the wife's turkey plate was surprisingly flavorful didn't expect much from roast turkey after all it's turkey but  it was tasty. 
our server Katie was friendly and very knowledgable about the menu. She also recommend some amazing looking desserts for us to take home!"}
{"text":"I ate dinner here tonight. I ordered the small plate of pot roast. It was great! The service was awesome as well. Even the host was all over it."}
{"text":"Great service and food.. Clean and delicious. Morning pancake were the best o and the California dreamins eggs and bacon."}
{"text":"I normally love Black Bear Diner. It's a good family restaurant at a decent price. But this location needs some serious help. 

My husband, daughter and I arrive at 8:30 on a Friday night and are seated almost immediately. The waitress  takes our drink order and about five minutes later she takes our food order. Everything seems totally fine. Then we play the waiting game. 

Two tables who arrived after us got their meals before us. One of those tables was a party of seven. Now normally I'm not one to complain about a long wait time. Initially I thought it was just because I had ordered a ribeye and that takes a bit longer to cook. 

By the time we got our food it was 20 minutes till closing. The party of seven that arrived after us had already eaten their dinner and desert and left. And the worst part? My steak was two-thirds fat and gristle, my vegetables were cold and my fries were horribly over salted.

So we're trying to eat as fast as possible and get out before 10pm, which is when they close. The waitress didn't bother to offer us dessert  (no surprise there) and unceremoniously dropped our check on the table. I take this as a sign she wants us to leave as soon as possible so we pack our food up and go up to pay the check.

The man who closed out our check is the same man I saw wandering around the dining area all night, loudly talking to his coworkers. So my husband I both got the vibe he was the person in charge at the time. He asked how everything was and we told him it was all pretty awful. The first thing he does is look at our check and inform us that we were only waiting 18 minutes. As if we have no concept of time. Then he goes into a line of excuses \"we're understaffed\" \"This time of night we lose a lot of people\" \"It's a strange transition period.\" Not once does he apologize for the terrible service or food. Then he tries to placate us with a free pie. Finally I tell him I don't want a pie, I want the same level of service any other customer would have. 

I will never be returning to this location ever again. The location south of the I-10 might be a bit out of the way but at least they value their customers over there."}
{"text":"I used to love eating Breakfast at Black Bear. The lunch and Dinner items i've had there were just so so. However, their is no quality control over what they serve, at least at breakfast time. They are so focused on being fast that the last 4 times i've gone there for breakfast i've been disappointed. Everything seems either over cooked or undercooked. Hash browns under cooked, eggs over cooked, toast slightly burnt on the edges, etc. I think they have all their stoves set on maximum temp. Sad. Oh and another thing. How is it that if my food arrives in 5 minutes that my toast, eggs, and potatoes are barely warm? The manager needs to inspect the food before it's sent out. It's just not very good anymore."}
{"text":"I love breakfast and this place won me over too many times.
The Bear's choice breakfast is my favorite with the Belgian waffles, biscuit, 2 eggs, and 2 spicy sausage links. The coffee is nothing to brag about but always hot and fresh.
The menu selection is big and the prices are reasonable for the huge portions. The servers are friendly and helpful at all times.
I love coming here."}
{"text":"The food was good, portions were awesome,  but if you are coming with a party larger than 4 forget about it!!  If you have a \"large\" party you might as well go to the Waffle House or IHOP for your family breakfast."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast on my recent visit to Vegas with a friend and her 2 kids. Since I wanted to catch up with a friend that I rarely see, I was looking for a restaurant that wouldn't rush us in and out. A couple of my friends recommended this place saying that it was very \"family friendly\" with good food.  We came around 9am on Veteran's Day, it was packed but we were seated quickly.

The menus are printed on newspapers and have some articles on the adult menus and games/coloring activities on the kids menus.  The manager also came by to give the kids balloons!  Our server Cindie was great!  She was always smiling, very attentive, and accommodating! 

I ordered the Vegetarian Omelette which consisted of 3 eggs, mushroom, onion, tomato, bell pepper, spinach, and jack cheese. I also added ham and jalapenos.  The meal included a choice of hash browns, country potatoes or fresh fruit and a housemade biscuit. I chose the country potatoes.  Everything was cooked and flavored perfectly! 

The portion sizes are pretty big and the prices are very reasonable. I was very happy with my overall experience here!

I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"The food was GREAT! We were a large party and the places was slammed. It took a long time for our food to come and when it did some of it wasn't what we ordered so it needed to go back (that's why it only got 4 starts from me). The manager did come over and apologize. That minor set back won't stop me from coming back however. The orange juice OMG, heaven!"}
{"text":"We will never return. Took the kids for lunch on a Thursday. We waited over 30 minutes for a sandwich, burger and 2 cold kids meals. I can't believe we paid $5 for a tiny portion of Kraft mac n cheese. The menu called it \"Brandis favorite macaroni and cheese\" and I assumed since it was priced higher than the other kids menu items that it would be the real thing. Instead it was a tiny cup of something I could pay 99 cents for at the grocery store. My husband's burger was cold and had BBq sauce on it, not the hot sauce he requested. We had to request to go boxes the minute our food arrived so my husband could get back to work. No time to eat. Basically we paid $40 to wait 45 minutes for cold food. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"I had never heard of the place until saying good bye to my best friend on our way from Seattle to Phoenix last week.  After she suggested it for breakfast (we were in a hurry so had to go for quick and easy instead) I seemed to drive by a million along the way through Cali.  We saw one right down the road from our Hotel once we made it into Phoenix and mused that we should try it out.  Come Saturday morning we were really in need of a good breakfast so off to the Black Bear we went.  

The wait wasn't nearly what we are use to (seriously, Seattle area waits can be ungodly for places like Denny's even).  We were seated in a large room with people all around eating awesome looking food.  After a few scans through the menu we placed our order and waited.  It wasn't very long at all when our waitress brings out two HUGE plates filled with food!  

I had decided that I might as well be a tough sell  (I would have to report back to my friend if I was a fan our not) and go all out and order the Tri tip Scramble with home-fried potatoes and toast.  The tips were cooked to perfection!  Not chewy or dry, just right!  My food was great, I couldn't even hope to finish my plate.  I can't remember what exactly my husband ordered but I know he finished his plate and we didn't even begin to feel hungry until past dinner time!

I am sold, I will be a Black Bear fan-girl from here on out!"}
{"text":"Hands down best pancakes, have had their country fried steak and I love it! We eat here atleast once a month. The bill is equivalent to Denny's or ihop but better home style plates and much more in portions. Lets not forget the fresh squeezed OJ! Bad thing is its always a small glass and no free refills. My favorite bfast joint! Love it!"}
{"text":"My family would always talk about how good this place is.....I finally came with them and I wasn't disappointed. Fresh food, great service!"}
{"text":"Usually like black bear but I get to place they make you sign in for bar area eat then service was bad 3-4 waitress pass buy before ask need menu something drink like this is your job greet say something me lol then then buy this process I've been here 20-25 and still haven't received nothing then finally they take my order terrible terrible service especially for outer Towner beware this place?????"}
{"text":"Our waitress was a grouchy bitch, and there was no fresh OJ, but other than that it was OK.  Loved the sign at the register that read \"No Open Carry\" of weapons.  Hahaha!  I was concealing, anyway..."}
{"text":"First time here...  and the last.

After a day of Xmas shopping, we were hungry.  We spotted the diner from the road and were drawn in by large chainsaw carved wooden bear statues outside a knotty pine palace.  campy and fun.....

Thats where the fun ended.

Table for two, looking for tasty grub.  ME:  chorizo breakfast burrito, side of has browns EXTRA crispy please.  Companion:  Chicken parm (one of her favs, normally) and a coke please!

What happened:  Chicken parm was incinerated black, and my hash browns were albino white.  She claims her \"coke\" was really a pepsi, and felt betrayed by the waiter.  The breakfast burrito was a total disaster - rolled and cut in half, exposing a giant plug of ice cold refried beans, obviously from a can.  It was clear that the chef made no effort to 1) heat the beans, 2) season the beans, or 3) spread the beans evenly along the tortilla.  After some digging, I did find the chorizo, along with the eggs and jalapenos.

FORTUNATELY I recognize these things by sight, because none of them contained any flavor that might have identified them.  The chicken parm was similarly bland, despite the charring of the breading.  We were confused at the total lack of flavor in any of our food items; I even forgot to order w/o jalapenos, but I didn't notice until I saw them.

I really wanted to like this place, and the star is for the bears and decor.  But sadly, the best part of my meal was the ketchup."}
{"text":"Patty Sausage Breakfast. Come hungry! This restaurant makes its own hash browns, sausage patty's and biscuits. Great customer service too."}
{"text":"This place was great!

We decided to finally stop in after driving by numerous times and had a good experience! Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One word AMAZING! I can't believe all the years I've lived in az and this is only my second time here well the good news is this will only be the breakfast place for me and my family from now on. Everything was cooked perfectly and the pancakes are flavorful everything is 5 stars service was good friendly"}
{"text":"Great homemade pancakes, fresh squeezed orange juice, and unforgettable \"bear claw\" breakfast pastries make this a great place for a wholesome, hot breakfast.

Food is great, service is average, and there's often a wait during the popular dining hours on weekends.  Hit this place on a weekday morning and you're in for a real treat."}
{"text":"Great food! The Grizz gives you three meats, eggs, potatoes, two pancakes for under $12. My husband and I shared it and could not finish it. Everything was delicious especially the pancakes! We'll return!"}
{"text":"Walked in and got seated fairly quickly. But once we got seated? We sat there for 15 min. No hello, no menu, no coffee, no nothing. Got up and took our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Delicious and worth the wait. We arrived on a Sunday morning. After circling the lot for 15 minutes we stalked some patrons leaving. Well a full lot is a good sign of what was yet to come. Our party of 5 all ordered something different and all enjoyed our meals."}
{"text":"Service is very friendly and the restaurant is clean with a fun atmosphere.  I ordered the reuben which was tasty.  A good deal for your money."}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner is great! Awesome food, large portions, great variety! This comfort food has a home-cooked taste just like Grandma used to make. The restaurant has a quaint northwest diner feel, and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Went here recently on a trip to Vegas.  Our waitress Elizabeth was awesomely  cute with the most adorable pair of eyeglass frames, and arrived at our table covered in some of the delicious delicacies that we were about to  partake.  Her arm was covered in butter and it looked like she had been working seriously hard during the morning rush. Never-the-less that busy morning did not put a  damper on her spirit or attitude. She was still amazingly friendly, patient, heartwarming, and knowledgeable. 
Oh, the food is good too, the portions are generous, and the pancakes are the best in the entire state of Nevada, crispy on the inside and moist and creamy on the inside. We were also allowed to substitute items on the menu. In my ginormous breakfast I had  bacon and both types of sausage instead of the ham. One can get ham steak anywhere; but how often does one get to try in house made patty sausage ........deeeeeeelicious!

If you go try to get Ol' Butter Arm Elizabeth for your waitress the food is good, but her smile and attitude make it great!"}
{"text":"If i could leave no stars i would.. Not really sure what's going on here.. is it closing, suffering from terrible management.. unsolved mystery.. went in over the weekend with my family. There was way to much staff on for the emptiness of the restraint which was probably for the best seeing as they were out of A LOT!! We to order our daughter a chocolate milk and were told they were out of chocolate syrup, heard the people behind ulus try to order a turkey & avocado sandwich and hey were told they were out of avocado. Husband and i ordered burgers none of the usual fixing were served with them (no lettuce, tomato, pickles,onion, mayo, etc. super weird!!) had to bed for napkins were oven only 2 for a family of 4, agin had to beg for silverware to have a waitress disappear for 5 minutes to 'hunt some down' and when she came back with it we were pretty positive she had to go did some from another table and wash them. Asked for a box to take our daughters leftovers and were told once again they were out of to go boxes (feel sorry for anyone wanting to do a phone order..) overall service was slow given the state of the dining room and the fact there was no one in there, server wasn't terrible not really sure which was ours because we never saw the same person twice other than for silverware. Also when i took our daughter to the restroom behind the counter was a disaster and a ton of empty shelves from what usually has stuff necessary to run a restaurant and do side work (boxes, cups, silverware prep, etc). I've eaten at this place in other towns and I've been a server.. this would have never flown in either case. Maybe I'll just stick to those ones and avoid this place because yeah.. it probably just needs to close. 

(This is the W Sahara location)"}
{"text":"It was my first visit in this place and i just love it! Now i can understand why my friends like it so much! Chris was such a patient and efficient  server, who took all the effort to make sure we feel comfortable and pleased with our order.. and Marlene as supervisor,  is always making sure we feel so happy with the attention that i don't wanna go any other place! Thank you very much guys!!"}
{"text":"We love this place.  Food is awesome and portions are huge. I've never had anything I didn't  like. Service today was mediocre though."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Love the breakfast! It's such a nice place to eat. There is always good vibes and the music is a good sound. Love how they decorated the place!"}
{"text":"My GF loved this restaurant growing up on the west coast. When she discovered this location she begged/demanded that we give this place a try. 

Servings are huge! The GF had a chef salad that could have easily served and filled up a family of four. The ingredients were fresh and had great flavor. Only. Complaint was that they didn't have regular ranch and she had to settle for their Bacon Ranch (there was none of it left to take home with her leftovers so it really wasn't a complaint with merit)

 The daughter had fish and chips, another huge portion good fish flavor but the fries were soggy. They might need a different routine (not leaving them hang over the frier etc to keep them crisp).

I had the Ravioli it was a huge portion I took half home with me as I also had the BlackBerry Cobbler. The Cobbler was amazing definitely worth stopping in for all by itself. 

The Ravioli wasn't bad but definitely not the best thing on their menu. It looked odd/out of place on the menu amongst all the country dishes and I just had to give it a try.

The Ravioli had a strong vinegar taste that I didn't care a whole lot for. The sauce outside of the vinegar was good and the pasta/meat was almost perfect.

The service was top notch quick to refill drinks. Quick to bring out extra dressing for the salads. Always with a smile and a country flare. 

I'm a fan and will be happy to return."}
{"text":"Pretty standard American fare done consistently deliciously.  Pretty enormous portions - you won't leave hungry!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for brunch and I brought my whole family with me since we were close by & hungry!

We all ordered and of 5 adults, I was the only one who enjoyed my dish. Everybody else barely ate any of what they ordered. The portions were huge! And that is cool and all but I feel like because of that, the food really lacked quality.
Our waitress asked if we needed togo boxes and she was surprised that they all said no. 

Well, I can't complain since my dish wasn't bad at all. I guess it's just best to ask the waitress what they recommend so that you aren't left with a mediocre dish that isn't what they're especially good at or used to making."}
{"text":"For that perfect cabin feel, look no further. If you like great breakfast food, and mountain/cabin type vibes... Then this is your spot. I love it here, it's a one of a kind restaurant."}
{"text":"Eat here at least once a month and love it. Manger really loves his place and is awesome  person. Food is outstanding and take home their deserts."}
{"text":"I've been to Black Bears throughout California and this one was not nearly as good as the others.  

The biscuits were hard and dry and I just was not that happy with our breakfast here. 

The portions are still crazy big but the quality of food and what you pay more just aren't what I had expected.  

If you are going to be a chain restaurant of sorts, everything should be consistent and this location is definitely not compared to others...."}
{"text":"Night shift supervisor Marlene was the best host.  She took care of us.  She helped us choose some awesome tasting dishes this was actually the first time my sister and I had been to a black bear diner and it was such an awesome experience.  The place was clean and our service was excellent on every level.  Promptly got our food,  perfect night."}
{"text":"GREAT food. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the waiter didn't check back with us very often at all. He was nice, I just hate looking around for my waiter. 
It's clean, decorated as the name would present it, like a lodge in the mountains. 
I had the turkey pesto sandwich that was amazing! My picture doesn't even do it justice.
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Forget Denny's .. The food is really good, great prices.. The Chicken Pot Pie..Wow.. The portion are huge. The Gentleman that runs the day shift is friendly and remembers the regulars. Very professional . Denise and April are wonderful servers. Always great service. Hard to choose what to eat..Luv this place.."}
{"text":"We come here quite a lot .  it's pretty busy some days but never to busy for our waitress Mindy to be kind and courteous to everybody.. My kids love the balloons that the manager always offers.. Good tastes good.. The Benedict plate is awesome in my opinion.. Just good vibes here which is what I like..."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in the area. Very good pancakes and bacon! Large portions but very good food. This visit the waiter made a mistake, and our order was lost. However, they took responsibility and got our order out as soon as the mistake was realized, and were very nice about it. The service other than that was wonderful. Nice people and a nice cozy log cabiny atmosphere! The orange juice is unmatched; very fresh and yummy. Overall a great meal. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"My first time at one of the diner's, and I'd really looked forward to trying it, the place was clean and busy for the time of day after 7pm and the Date- the evening before Easter so I was encouraged that something good was going on in their ! I was sure of what the menu would be like so I asked the waiter for his recommendation and he chose their Chicken Pot Pie of all things, and when I noticed it prior when glancing at the menu I had though to myself that I hadn't had a Good pot pie since my Grandmothers some 40+ years so I went for it, and was Very Pleasantly Surprise and the freshness, flavor and the size of the  portion that was served ! Although I was a little cautious at the speed of receiving my food. I placed the order spoke about 10 words to my dinning partner and he was putting the pie on my table !!! Hummm ! That was faster than Chinese food !!! and it was that warm ! but very tasty. So on the next visit I may order it again to compare the preparation time !!! But I will definitely go back !"}
{"text":"This is my go to place.  It's close to home (Trop & Jones), has wonderful food, and great service.  Nothing better than a trip to Black Bear when nursing a hangover.  The place is covered with bears (as you can imagine), both stuffed and wooden, and photos everywhere.  

I have never eaten anything here besides the breakfast, but that is all you need.  My girlfriend has had lunch there though and says it's wonderful.  The sausage is made in house, and it delicious.  Gigantic biscuits are the standard here.  In fact, I have never had a bad meal here.  

Truly a great experience, reminds me of the diners back in the mid-west."}
{"text":"Disappointing. The cooks couldn't get the food right. We ordered 2 different burgers from the menu with no special requests and they came out wrong and not good. The waitress even apologized and said they have only been open 1 month and the cooks only had 1 week of training.  I think this place needs more time to get it right. The waitress was nice to take 1 of the burgers off the menu. Like another reviewer said, its too pricey for what it is. There was 3 of us, 2 burgers, 1 pancake breakfast and drinks. Now she took one of those burgers off so she charged us 1 burger, pancake breakfast and drinks and it was $27! Not worth it."}
{"text":"My kids love this place! They actually have the best breakfast burritos and kids chocolate chip pancakes. I usually only come for breakfast. I do come for dinner once and the food was just ok. The soup tasted like it was from a can. The price is right though."}
{"text":"What a great breakfast!  Waitress was extremely friendly, and she actually seemed happy to be there.  All staff was very nice, and accommodating.  Even the owner/manager came around and asked us how everything was.  NICE TOUCH!  :)  Was in the area looking to re-locate, and found this little gem of a diner one morning.   I will definitely be back for breakfast again, and can't wait to check it out for lunch and dinner.  Thanks for a great experience Black Bear!"}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes to be seated, waited 30 minutes after food was ordered.  Restaurant was full, but only had 1 bus boy.  Ran out of hashbrowns.  I ordered an open face turkey sandwich - surprise!   They ran out of gravy !  Didn't even offer to comp the meal.  A rather unpleasant experience.  Doubt I would go back."}
{"text":"Good food, good decoration, good service. American brunch. I ordered steak, sunny side up, potatoes, toast, and orange juice. I will come again!"}
{"text":"Always a good spot for huge servings of comfort food. Not really much else to say. It's on our \"yes\" list of places to eat that'll make everyone in our family happy and full."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. The portions are huge (It's kind of their thing), but even better the food is top quality. All the ingredients seemed to be really fresh. I got a jalapeno burger with fresh peppers, not the canned ones you would normally expect. Also the service is great and the food is cheap. 

This is my go-to for dinner when I don't want to dress up."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and food portions are unfinishable!! For breakfast its probably the bust place to eat because you will not be hungry for most of the day---poss until dinner! Staff is friendly and food taste fresh and coffee too!"}
{"text":"We got here about an hour and a half ago. The restaurant is completely empty and we still haven't brought our food out. Our waitress was really nice and felt really bad but also informed us that there are 5 cooks in the kitchen. So this is no excuse. Definitely not not a great experience for my first time here! Needless to say, never coming back!"}
{"text":"FIRST IMPRESSIONS
Holy Bear Heaven, Batman! This place is a little slice of Northern California right here in Vegas! Delicious food, giant portions, fantastically happy and friendly staff!

SPECIAL KUDOS
Dan is the manager at this location and he loves it. We connected with him over Northern California (my friend Jessica grew up down the road from him). It's a special thing when you can have a nice conversation with restaurant staff. Speaks volumes about job satisfaction that translates directly into the quality of service from the host, to the cooks, to the manager.

I didn't catch William, our server, without a smile on his face. He was also fun to chat with and seemed to enjoy his work. He kept our drinks full and faces smiling.

Seriously: major kudos and props to the team at this restaurant. We will be coming back every year to relive this experience!

THE EATS
Breakfast Burrito -- I opted for something hand held and I wasn't disappointed. The burrito itself wasn't huge, but that was overshadowed by huge flavors. It also came with a side of fresh salsa and a giant portion of their delicious hash browns.

My friends had the California Benedicts and Joe's Hobo Omelette. It would be an understatement to say their plates were clean. There was nary a speck of food left to make you think the plates hadn't come straight out of the dishwasher.

THE VERDICT
This place is an absolute gem in this town. Homey, friendly, and downright delicious! If you have an opportunity to try this place, DEFINITELY GO!!!!"}
{"text":"Everyone's friendly ,  Great service with a warm welcome. 
Place is very clean
I had the patty melt delicious delicious delicious .ill be back again ."}
{"text":"Oh my! Excellent customer service! Food was done to perfection. Seasoned just right, still hit when served! Great hot sauce on the table."}
{"text":"Breakfast for the second time yesterday 7/23/17. OMG the country fried steak is AMAZING!!! Both times. I was wondering after the first visit could this be heaven??? What pure deliciousness! So fresh and yummy for my high maintenance tummy. Great job guys. I also had egg whites scrambled with cheese on top and a hash brown. They were made to perfection.  
Wow I just love writing a 5 star review. This place is great.
BTW I've never dinned in this review is off of take out. Which in my opinion is a harder customer to please...
I will return, 5 Stars"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of this Black Bear for several years now. The food has always been excellent and the service top notch. However, our recent experience was a little less awesome. They took my wife and I to a table that was dirty and had food everywhere on it (had to have them wipe the entire table and seats off). Then they saw my wife standing there waiting for them to maybe dry the wet seat in the booth, but they did nothing. So my wife took a couple napkins on the table and dried it off. Then the silverware was dirty and sticky too.

Prices are a little high now as well. My wife ordered 2 eggs, browns, and toast (i.e. no meat) and it was $7.29. Most breakfasts with meat like bacon or an omelette are in the $8 to $10 range now. 

Anyway, I'm still a fan and will continue to eat there. But I hope this isn't a sign of things going downhill at Black Bear. I know times are getting tough for businesses, but keeping tables clean   and good service are not big expenses for a business. Irritating and losing customers is a huge loss for a business. I hope Black Bear steps it back up to their usual high standards."}
{"text":"First place I have been in where the cleaning crew swept and mopped the floor while you were eating. Rather ruined the taste.. disinfectant  and pancakes just don't mix. The dining room maybe ok but eating at the counter..awful."}
{"text":"Tried B.B. diner a couple of times the food is just average portions are huge but again hugely average. The people were friendly service was fine. I've only tried the breakfast menu maybe there lunch and dinner are better I'm sure I'll try it again soon enough."}
{"text":"What a great experience. The food was amazing. The staff was friendly particularly the manager Don. Even though they were really busy we were served quickly and the staff was very efficient. The pancakes are awesome."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!! My mother and sister were in town visiting and we went there on a whim after we were shopping at the next door Smith's and we were all three super hungry. Let me tell you we were not disappointed! The outdoor is so cute with little wooden bear totem poles and there's like a little mini gift shop in the foyer. It felt very comfy and homey as soon as you walked in. Our hostess who I unfortunately forgot her name was very nice and could tell it was our first time so she was patient and explained things to us. Our waitress, Esther, was such a sweetheart and informed us of the weekly fish fry Friday which included all you can eat fish!! They brewed a fresh pot of coffee for us which was REALLY good. Their portions are HUGE!!!! Seriously, my sister got the big portion steak and my mom and I got the \"little less\" version of country fried steak and pork roast and honestly all three were just gigantic. My sister's was the biggest of course but my mother and I still struggled to finish ours. Each dinner comes with a soup or salad, a delicious homemade cornbread muffin, mashed potatoes, and a veggie (green beans or mixed veggies, Both were good). Everything was just so delicious and Esther had the best customer service. It was an all around great experience. I will definitely come again and recommend it to anyone who wants a diner feel with amazing prices and huge portions!"}
{"text":"I was here this morning and it's always so great my waitress beatrice  was so nice and wasn't slow the food was so s so great and their freshly squeezed orange juice was perfect."}
{"text":"Never ever heard of Black Bear Diner in my life until now... and realizing that it's a chain is crazy. Portions here are huge! But my friend and I are on a healthy eating spree so we decided to get something on the smaller side. He ordered from the fit menu and really enjoyed his meal. I ended up getting the club sandwich on sourdough bread and it came with a choice of a side so, me trying to eat healthy, I chose a salad. For a lunch portion it was still pretty big to me. It was pretty good but nothing amazing. The service was okay. My friend is allergic to avocados and she forgot to modify the order and he had avocados on his plate. Didn't mention anything cause it's not deadly or anything and we don't wanna be those people, but still... I'm sure I'll be back again in the future to try some of their breakfast options."}
{"text":"This location rocks - excellent food, excellent staff.  I expect awesome food from Black Bear, every time I have been (around 6 times at various locations) the food has been great.  The staff at this location almost make up for my bad previous experience.  Based on this visit alone, I would offer them a 4.5 out of 5 stars (minus .5 stars due to playing country music - yucko!)

**Please note - we only went this time because my inlaws wanted to go.  I am glad we did but still confess to feeling conflicted about giving them my business.

***Update: Since this review (below) was posted, management contacted me and reassured me they were appalled by our bad experience.  This occurred within hours of posting the review below...which was a very pleasant surprise.

Why the 3 stars you ask?  The last time previous to the reviewed visit (2008 Beaverton, last weekend in was in Avondale) I had visited a Black Bear, we lived in Oregon and were at the Beaverton location.  My wife and I had both visited Black Bear before, and both thought they were the bomb.  

Our 2008 visit in Beaverton changed our perception of this chain though.We were asked to \"clear the table because we were interfering with the waitresses' revenue stream\".  WTF?!?!   I have been really out of line when I was younger, and never been asked to \"move along\" like that.  We were enjoying a cup of coffee after a satisfying breakfast doing absolutely nothing out of line.

Our table had the only latino customers in the restaurant, and the only latino staff on the premises was in the kitchen, all other on duty staff was white - just like me.  We were speaking Spanish (my wife and friend were helping me practice).  We were getting lots of crusty looks from other customers - all of which were white.  Three tables were waiting to be bussed, one party of four was waiting for a table.

You tell me what was going on here.

Management on duty claimed the waitress had a point, and when I raised  stink, offered us a free meal, which we declined.

Upon raising my concern to ownership via email, I was told my concern was not legitimate, because the restaurant manager (who was not present) was latino."}
{"text":"Mediocre all around but not many other choices in this area. Service was awkward as the waitress liked to flirt with my boyfried. She should have paid attention to me because I was the one paying. Don't get anything other than breakfast. Sides are not good and meatloaf has celery in it. Yuck."}
{"text":"Taking a break from the \"The Strip\" can have it's rewards.

While on vacation in LV, we decided that we were going to have most of our meals off the strip, to eat where the locals eat, and have some time when The Black Eyed Peas are not blasting in my ears when I am trying to eat. 

Thanks to YELP we checked this place out. Loved the decor from the very start, the place was hardly crowded and the menus are printed on newsprint.

Our waiter was super friendly, and the food was great. I had the Tri-Tip dip, the sandwich was cooked to perfection, the others at the table had the meatloaf and the chicken fried steak. All where a hit. For dessert we all split an amazing coconut cream pie.

The prices are really good, about average for what you would get anywhere else. What we ordered would probably cost twice as much, if you could even find this kind of food.

The setting was about 4 miles off the strip and offered a nice change of pace that allowed us to talk to one another and plan the rest of our night.

Great place, if in Vegas this and The Original Pancake House are a must for eating."}
{"text":"2/23/16 Myself and friends had dinner here.The waitress was really attentive (Tahra) and caring.The food however was less than poor.I had a patty melt which was over cooked ,and very dry. The gumbo was really bad, it didn't even resemble a gumbo which has a flour /oil rue base.I realize this place is not a 5 star eatery ,but the food was really bad. Maybe I just got there on a bad night ,but I won't ever return."}
{"text":"THE best Black Bear experience ever! The staff are all warm & friendly, very welcoming. Our waitress was Tonya & she provided exceptional service. I highly recommend this Black Bear Diner, two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The Black Bear Diner is a very good restaurant! It is a perfect blend of 50s and modern wilderness. The jukebox is always playing good tunes and I have not had an issue with food or service yet. The reason for 3 stars, they don't take reservations / call ahead seating. We were celebrating my daughters birthday today and she wanted to have it here, she loves this place. We had a good size party with us and a call ahead would have alleviated stress on all ends. I understand not taking reservations but a call ahead is to let the restaurant know to be expecting you. They don't have to block an area off, but to be looking for you for minimal wait time. We have now been standing here for an hour and the hostess just came up to tell us that they have started blocking off tables for us. Food: great! Waiting service: great! Planning service: needs some work!"}
{"text":"I had dinner there two nights ago.  The staff was friendly and the food was great I had the chicken fried steak it was cooked perfectly.  

My only issue was that the place is filthy.  The carpet is old and stained there was food on the floor and when the staff was wiping off the take they were simply pushing the crumbs onto the seats.  

If the clean that place up it will get a 5 star from me."}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner on Sahara has a lot of work ahead if it is to be successful

First of all,our waitress (name might be Melissa) was trying to go to another table until I said MISS!  She came back and took our order despite being in another dimension.

My wife's giant burger was not that giant and my pancakes did not have enough syrup.

Our whole experience was sad because we have had a lot of great experiences at the Black Bear on Tropicana.

Can a restaurant ever find good help?"}
{"text":"If you're in the Phoenix area, this place is a must! They have the best orange juice I have ever tasted and their bacon is thick and awesome! I've had their French toast and waffle, which are both great! And today I had the blt and the Parmesan kettle chips and they were great! I've never had a bad meal here and the service is always awesome. I highly recommend Black Bear."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times food here is good , service on the other hand is a hit or miss being a server myself I deal with many people so yes your not always going to be happy but ... if you DONT  LIKE YOUR JOB then you should be in that industry customer service is a must .. just a little pointer put a SMILE ON for 2 seconds might get you a little further in your day"}
{"text":"i absolutely love this place excellent service.. my waiter josh was very knowledgable about the menu. the portin was nice & the food was just great. the ambiance & mood of the place puts you in a very good mood. i love it!"}
{"text":"My family and I go every weekend. We love it. The employees are always so nice and the food is always good. This morning our waiter was James and he was awesome. We've never waited more than 5 minutes to be seated and that's when you have small kids. We'll continue to go every weekend."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this new location on Sahara, and our first visit to a Black Bear Diner. I was pleased with the food and atmosphere, but our server Chris really made the experience great! He was helpful with the menu and offering suggestions, attentive, and very professional our whole visit. 

If you haven't tried one yet, and have room left for dessert, get the chocolate cream pie! Soooo yummy and more than enough for two people to share! I'm really glad this place has opened up in our area because we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Prices went up... Too pricey for the filth I had to deal with. Watched as several of the employees came to work. Those that drove themselves took the front parking spots."}
{"text":"this place is awesome their exellent customer service is consistent in every location I have been too our server was very attentive and friendly my grandma has been to various locations around the country and this is one of her favorite go-to places when she's traveling"}
{"text":"stopped in for breakfast today and the food was cold. the chicken was old and tasted so nasty.

will not return"}
{"text":"I wrote a scathing review of BBD but I will reluctantly upgrade it from 1 star to 3 stars. David D. at customer service responded to my complaints promptly and politely. No...I did not receive a comp. nor did I want any. My only hope is they will take care of their problems as he stated to me in his reply so unsuspecting customers will no longer be taken advantage of. No....I definitely will still not be returning nor recommend them to anyone!"}
{"text":"Had the corned beef hash here and it's very tasty. Though not the best one have had as the corned beef just didn't have a lot of flavor, it was still much better than the canned.

It came with scrambled eggs and hash Brown's, or at least that's the one I chose. Hash Brown's were above average and the scrambled eggs were pretty good.

One thing I really like is their pancake syrup contains real maple syrup. I just wished that it was pure, or made with cane sugar. Still tasted better than regular pancake syrup.

Will be coming back here to have some other menu items. Am definitely pleasantly pleased."}
{"text":"After a long day of hiking in the red rocks, my family and I stopped here for some dinner. My husband ordered the western burger, I ordered the pecan trout with a baked potato, and a kids pizza for my daughter. And we finished it off with a lava cake. Everything was wonderful and fast. Our server was attentive and great! I wish we could remember his name. He seemed to be in his 20's with dark hair and glasses. Just wanted to give him a shout out because we noticed how rude and impatient some of his other customers were to him, and he kept it cool. The customer is not always right, some times the customer is a jerk. Keep up the good work, we appreciated it!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Excellent service.  Adorable atmosphere. I can't wait to go again. Thanks"}
{"text":"This was our second time to this adorable cafe while visiting Vegas and they never disappoint.  Service and food are impeccable.  Large portions for reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The Food Was Really good. Portions are huge. Mostly the service was right on. Ashton did an amazing job. For that I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's my first time to eat here and it definitely won't be my last. I love the food, service is fast, staff are nice. Price is decent."}
{"text":"You get a ton of food here. I ordered the meatloaf half plate special. The server brought me a full platter by mistake which was way too much food. I had three meals. I liked that he made it right by giving me a credit on my bill even though I said I did not mind. I do not like to waste food so asked him to keep the food at the table and not remake it. 

This place is kind of like a home style diner with a bear theme. The menu is fun since it has old school newspaper clippings about Glendale. Black Bear has huge, old school family meals for the most part. It is a pretty good place to eat at but nothing more than what it is. 

I appreciate their volunteer work with Veterans and Make A Wish. They had several charitable events and opportunities there for the holidays."}
{"text":"The food is just all right. Nothing spectacular and honestly, you can probably find any other diner in town that is the same if not better. 

That being said, I come here whenever I want food on the cheap, in my neighborhood served by friendly staff in a timely manner.

The wait staff is pleasant and friendly and how can you not like the decor. Bears, bears and more bears!

It's best to probably go for breakfast or dessert. Their lunch and dinners are nothing to write home about. Definitely check out the Blackbeary Cobbler a la mode. It's devine and oh so cheap!!! :)"}
{"text":"They refuse to take people after 8pm. How unprofessional when they close at 10pm on Saturday nights. I don't recommend going to this black bear location. I recommend the location at dysart."}
{"text":"Breakfast  to a whole new level guys, it's like breakfast on freaking steroids. It was so delicious , the pancakes were so fluffy and delicious. The eggs were just right. Mmmmmm the bacon  was nice and crispy. Service nice a friendly, and yes I'll be here again to enjoy the food. But seriously though this is like IHOP and Denny on roids lol jk I'm just saying the portion is huge"}
{"text":"The parking lot was pretty packed so I was prepared to wait awhile but we were seated immediately. The hostess took our drink order so there was minimum lag time to getting a beverage! That was a great bonus as sometimes a server gets busy and you wait forever for a drink. 

Dawn, our server was efficient and prompt. She was attentive yet not too over \"bearing\", lol. Seriously, she was super friendly and came back or by several times incase we needed something. The portion sizes were gigantic and could probably be shared."}
{"text":"Breakfast is probably my favorite meal of the day, unless you count dessert.  My husband and I met my family out here one day after having a good and yummy experience at another location.

The service here is always good, the kids here usually know how to work a breakfast crowd.  You come quick, get drinks, take order, bring food, ask about food, take food, leave check... you know.  I don't like them chatty in the morning.  I've never been disappointed in terms of service at these places.  

The food is always good.  It's simple breakfast food done in a traditional manner.  Nothing is too complicated or too foreign sounding.  They have a few creative combinations for omelets for the people that like that kind of stuff.  I particularly like that they have a combo plate that includes like 10 slices of bacon.  Maybe not that many, but it's a lot. 

If you are looking for good breakfast food with good service that wears suspenders, give Black Bear a try.  Just a warning though, I have seen the places get pretty crowded."}
{"text":"A good breakfast place. Had waffle, bacon and eggs. I am very picky on my bacon and it was really good.. thick-cut, salty and chewy. The only thing lacking is a smoke flavor but good. The waffle was really good too. Sweet, fluffy, and crunchy. Very good. Clean my plate with a cup of coffee. Great way to start the day."}
{"text":"Best chocolate cream pie I've ever had! Really yummy burgers and fries, great service, and PIEEEE"}
{"text":"Been here and several other locations in NV and Utah. This location seems tired and in need of an update. Our host was friendly but our server seemed distracted on coffee and water refills. The food is plentiful, but maybe just today, seemed lacking seasoning and was overall bland.  I still enjoy the family diner feeling, but next time another location."}
{"text":"We came here today before super bowl for some breakfast before the game. The hostess greeted and sat us at a booth.  10 minutes pass and no one acknowledges us or takes our order.  The waitress for our table passes by and asks if anyone has come over to take our drink order, we explain that no one has yet. She asks what we would like to drink and comes back shortly with our beverages. While she sets them down my husband tells her we're ready to place our food order, and she explains she will be back shortly to take our order. This is now 15 minutes after we've sat. 20 minutes goes by and I look around to see if I can find out server. Another server is 3 feet away having a full on conversation with a table and at the same time watching me look around for someone. She looks at me and I say I just want to put our food order in. She says \"sorry I'm off already, I'm just trying to make sure they're ok.\"  Oh I'm sorry, maybe you should say something like let me get your server or sure let me take your order and I'll give it to your server? Maybe that would be the appropriate response. She then walks over to the table behind us to pick up their dirty dishes and says something under her breath about me. I turned around and said \"Excuse me? Did you say something?\" And she responds \"NO I DIDNT MAM.\" Firstly I thought you were off? So why are you clearing another tables plates and saying something about me under your breath at their table? So rude. Finally our server comes over and takes our order and we get our food 35 minutes after we sat. Meanwhile we ordered eggs, and I know eggs don't take much time. When the food arrived my husband thought his food was tasteless, my potatoes were bland, tasted like they had been frozen, perhaps even freezer burn. This has been the worst dining experience I have ever had.  Go to the other locations their service is better, the staff is friendlier, and the food is better. Here's a photo of the EXTREMELY RUDE WOMAN who was \"already off\"  enjoy."}
{"text":"Wow! The portions are crazy! The pancakes were perfection (and the size of a small pizza), bacon cooked to perfection and eggs (I swear they gave me 6 eggs). Either way, we loved it!"}
{"text":"Ate breakfast there yesterday. The corned beef hash was \"to die for\"! My poached eggs were cooked perfectly. The biscuits are light and fluffy! The staff was pleasant and attentive. Can't wait to go back the next time I am in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Best place to get a big, hearty breakfast. CInnamon roll french toast is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Came on a Thursday at 10am for a late breakfast with my husband and 3 kids. It wasn't very busy at all, but took an hour to get our food. Our kids were restless and antsy and it made for a frustrating wait. It was our first visit, we've been wanting to try for some time. I got the steak and eggs. The steak was cooked as desired and had decent flavor. The country potatoes were terrible, however, hardly cooked, almost raw mixed with hardly any peppers and onions. They offered it with fruit or biscuits, but had to pay an addt'l $1.75 for gravy. LAME! Who orders biscuits without gravy? At any rate, the small and meager amount of gravy I did receive was decent, nothing great. All in all, our bill was over $50, for a blah breakfast. We probably won't return due to service and just nothing to write home about food."}
{"text":"We were looking for lunch last Saturday and drove by this diner. I've seen it before with its tell tale bear statues, but this time we were looking for something new and eclectic. This is what we got! We were seated pretty quickly and Jeff took our drink orders. He was a little goofy but in a really pleasant way. They were testing a new kid's menu that we thought worked really well for our daughter. My wife got lunch and I ordered breakfast. Sure, it took a little while to get the food but that was ok because there's so much to see and look at. The food was large portions and good. It was immensely awesome, but it was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"So, this is a yelp find led wrong. They have hundreds of reviews and 4 stars...not sure why.

The food was blah...I had the French dip. The meat was over cooked and the side salad was boring (iceberg lettus with a few cherry tomatoes and cucumber slices). Overall, just not good food. 

The service was fine. Nothing great but not terrible either. 

I should have known when I walked in to this place it was going to be a poor experience. The decor and cleanliness were poor...normally I leave if this happens but the friends I was with didn't want to. 

It must have a good breakfast, idk why else the stars would be so high."}
{"text":"We go hear regularly. It's a good diner with a giant menu, something for everybody. Surprisingly, there's a good selection of beer, too."}
{"text":"We've been seeing this place driving by Alma School for quite some time now. We figured tonight was time to finally giving it a try. 

The hostress and our waitress Carrie are super friendly. I love their cheerful and positive attitude. It is very pleasant to see that in any type of work place. For entrees, we ordered fried chicken and homemade meatloaf. The meal comes with either soup or salad, and side order includes french fries, smash potatoes with gravy or onion rings (I can't remember all the choices now). The fried chicken is delicious but was a bit over cooked. Chicken meat was a bit dry. Overall it was tasty. Meatloaf, however, isn't as good as I anticipated. The brown sauce was thick and tasteless...so was the gravy. I only ate half a piece of meatloaf and simply couldn't finish the rest of them. 

For dessert, we ordered a peach cobbler with vanilla bean ice-cream on the top of it. The peaches were tasty but overall it wasn't as good as how we usually like it.  It was smushy and doesn't look exactly like what we saw on the menu. 

I'm not sure if I will come back again, but I do appreciate the wonderful service. I do like their hot sauce though. They have 4 different level of hot sauce to choose from and very favorable"}
{"text":"Great food and good service!!!!! Prim rib-8 stars, chicken fried steak- 9 stars, pancakes-8 stars oh soooo fluffy!!! Also kids eat free on Tuesdays. Oh my whole family's favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"The first few times we came here it was great.  Nice fluffy scrambled eggs, great service, tasty pancakes, all of that.  The past several times I have gone here, however; it has gone like this:

Walk inside, notice that yet again no one is at the hostess stand.  Notice no one is at the register to ask, stand there looking like an idiot while out wait fir an employee to notice that you'd maybe like to sit and kick your breakfast off... so when that finally happens, you'll be seated and then someone else will eventually take your beverage order even though you've had more than enough time to decide while you were waiting... and when they come back with your burnt coffee they may take your food order.  

When the food arrives, what you'll get is anyone's guess.  I've gotten anything from raw in the middle pancakes to over cooked with that burnt taste and rubbery texture that instantly ruins pancakes... it's so hit and miss but never good anymore.  The eggs are just bad, which is interesting since they are so easy to do right, but yesterday they were inedible and overcooked.

So bad food, bad service, utterly clueless management that is seemingly fine with all of this and no one is surprised why business is lighter every visit... too bad, it could be great breakfast with just a little work."}
{"text":"Been here twice now.  First time food was heavy and there is a lot of it plus the gravy is good.  Was semi happy.  For a family of four the price is to expensive for the bad service received.  Ice tea should not be $2.50+ cents.  Not like it is a cake or soda.  You take tea bags water and brew it.  Total cost to make is cents on the dollar.  Anyways the server tonight was apparently to busy to attend to me as a paying customer and when he came back to refill my Arnold Palmer he brings tea only.  Asked for meal smothered in gravy and I had to ask for more.   The wife meal was bland and actually I did not like it at all.  This is the second time eating there and my last.  To expensive.  Bad sevice.  Bad to average cooked meal.  I love a good breakfast this is far from it.  For this price I would rather go to the broken yolk or for the quality of the food i would go to denny's and have a better breakfast.  Good luck black crapt bear diner."}
{"text":"Great spot for comfort food. Hidden gem. Food was good, staff was friendly. I'm a 320 lbs man and left with country fried steak to spare!"}
{"text":"Brunch date!

I met up with the date buddy at 1PM on a Monday afternoon and was out the door in less than 45 minutes (partially because we were on a time crunch since he had to go to work).

When we first walked in the door, I noticed how exceptionally busy they were.  There were unbused tables, people lining up at the cashier register to pay their bills, and no host/hostess in sight.  I was a tad confused as to what to do, so we just waited.  Eventually, a gentleman came around and greeted us, asked us to wait for a table to be cleaned up, but then proceeded to greet the party of 4 behind us (whom he was obviously familiar with) and lead them to an open table.  I was also a tad confused to this as well.  But we eventually got seated and drinks ordered.

The menu is cutely printed on a faux newspaper, and it seemed a bit huge and overwhelming.  I didn't realize they shoved breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner all into two pages.  It was a bit much.

I ordered the eggs benedict.  The food came out super quick and was perfectly warm.  I noticed right away there were bits of bacon on my potatoes, YUM! And these were real potatoes, not frozen and reheated, but real potatoes.  That's always plus.  Then I noticed there was a GENEROUS portion of hollandaise on my eggs.  It was a tad much for me, but it was good.  My eggs were wonderfully poached and the ham was tastefully salty.

Like I said, we were out the door in 45 minutes, even after waiting to be seated and the cash register debacle of taking awhile to process our debit cards when we were checking out.  I wanted to give the restaurant 4 stars because of the food, but I had such high expectations from reading other Yelp reviews and the service did not deliver.  I do believe it was in part due to being so busy and they did appear short-staffed, but I was slightly disappointed."}
{"text":"Taryn went above and beyond to make our dinner a great experience.  She was exceptionally attentive and offered the best service we've had in a long time. We will return! Food was great!"}
{"text":"I am back all the way from Orlando Fl. My husband and I found this dinner 4 years ago and we always come back. I highly reccommend this place for lunch and dinner, i am sure that must be great for breakfast too  Dont hesitate and order a shake, my favorite is Chocolate no whipped cream"}
{"text":"Love the decor of this diner, service was very prompt and friendly. Sahara ave. Is nice and close to home. Breakfast burrito and a side fresh fruit bowl was excellent and very filling.  My husband's burger and fries were very good also.  Will definitely revisit so we can try more of the many selections on the menu.  Good amount of food for the price."}
{"text":"I recommend the black bear on Tropicana it is a lot better.
I had bacon and eggs for breakfast. Hashbrowns were cold and stale. Bacon was under cooked. Sent bacon back and it came back deep-fried which made it worse."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and never had a bad meal. You get tons of food for not bad prices and the service is excellent. Must come!"}
{"text":"Service was fine, but the food not good. I think there pancakes and bacon were fine. However, how do you mess up eggs over easy? The whites were very runny. Also, the others at my table disliked the eggs Benedict and scramble. I'm not a picky eater at all and the food was not acceptable. I was surprised by how high their rating is."}
{"text":"Black Bear Diner!....let me see. Where do I start? First of all, they are decked out with bear gear. Which is the cutest, it makes you feel like you're eating in a lodge in some backwoods town. (This feeling btw is a good one lol). You get to sneak away from the busy life of a \"city life\" to enjoy some fresh treats. I always enjoy their bears special, which you get to choose your style eggs and whether you'd like pancakes, waffles, biscuits or sausage, bacon etc. i recently tried their chorizo scramble & it is great. All their portions are large, enough to share if you'd like. Although everything seems too good that you may not want to share. Haha And dessert?? Make sure you leave room because their pies are to die for!! I typically take a chocolate pie home & myself & my fiance will enjoy it later. Great spot! Kid friendly! Family friend! Warm inviting environment! Love this spot & I recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  Portions are large and you will not leave hungry! Host and servers were all very pleasant,efficient, and friendly."}
