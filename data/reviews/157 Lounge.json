{"text":"Excellent sushi!  The service is always fast and the atmosphere is great.  If you're looking for fresh sushi, great service and great prices, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Incredibly poor service, even on a slow night. I had to wait 10 minutes for the bartender to even acknowledge our existence.  After we finished our drinks, no one bothered to ask if we wanted another. Completely overrated."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for happy hour, and since it runs until 9pm, I never have to rush out of work. Huge fan of the pear martini and spicy tuna rolls. Sushi is always amazing, and the drink selection is good. Service can be a tiny bit slow, but everyone is super friendly, and we're never in a rush, so it's not a big deal. The only reason I've rated it a 4 star is because the decor could use a refreshing. Nothing needs changed, but a new coat of paint and replacement of some of the floorboards would do wonders. Great place!"}
{"text":"Anyone who thinks this place has good sushi clearly has never had good sushi. The fishy smell is the first indication that the sushi probably isn't the freshest.  Just okay, but since it's in Kent, sometimes you settle with what you got."}
{"text":"Ray Flanagan , blues musician playing. Good entertainment. Slow to get our sushi, but enjoyed the music. Food was fresh and nice. Pork potstickers  were good. Tempura shrimp were little bit mushy and were  lukewarm."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite places in Kent! They always have a ton of drink specials and the sushi is great. You can't beat their newest promotion they call \"Kamikaze Thursday.\" Every Thursday from 9-midnight sushi and desserts are half price! A bunch of friends and I usually just order a ton of rolls and split them. It costs us each under $10 with drinks! Great music, great food, great atmosphere. A must try!"}
{"text":"I have gone a few times for their Sushi night, as on Thursday they have 1/2 price sushi.  The sushi is fresh and pretty good (especially at half price).  However, the biggest flaw with this restaurant is the service.    The service moves at a snails pace.  We've all had to put up with slow service on occasion, but the service here is consistently slow.  Furthermore, it seems that tables get their food at random and it is not related to when their order was taken (e.g., we've waited an hour only to have people come in, order after us, get served, eat, pay, and leave before we even receive our food).    I hate to say it, but I think the slow service stems from the fact that the waitresses are hired based on physical appearance and not on their ability to wait tables.  My wife and I consistently get paired with one server who, as cute as she may be, is a little bit on the slow side.  On one occasion, she brought wine randomly to our table as if we had ordered more (we hadn't).  We also highly suspected that our long wait was related to some kind of mistake she had made when punching in our order (as other tables kept getting served ahead of us).    All in all, if you can bear the wait and bear the slow service, it's not a bad place to go.  I just prefer to go somewhere else without such a long wait."}
{"text":"My friend ordered takeout for the first time here and when she was trying to find the entrance, one of the workers there who was an older white male assumed she was Chinese and started speaking mock Chinese towards her and said \"Chinese,no?\" This was said after she clearly asked them in English (her first language) where she could find 157 lounge. Offended, she went inside and told the waitress there who was sitting at the bar what happened and if he was the manager, all she had to respond to the question was \"why?\" After my friend got her food and went back outside she told the same guy not to say things like that and he just responds with \"aww\". Terrible. She wrote this same review on their Facebook but apparently can't find it anymore. Sushi was decent, customer service was trash."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in town for the holidays and decided to stop at 157 Lounge for a drink. Having never been in this martini/sushi bar in the middle of downtown Kent we were skeptical. From the moment we walked in the door those concerns vanished.   I ordered a classic dirty vodka martini and my wife a specialty drink from the impressive selection. Both were made to perfection! Great ambiance and professional staff made us feel welcomed and relaxed. We ordered a few sushi rolls per the recommendation of the manager and were again pleasantly surprised. The \"157 Roll\" was excellent and a perfect roll to start out with; classic Maki with an American twist. Our other rolls followed soon after and were just as tasty.  This is a welcome retreat from the over-crowded, cheap stale beer, college dive bar scene that is all too common. 157 Lounge staff is friendly and knowledgeable, the sushi chef is exceptionally talented, prices are right, and the location is perfect! We will definitely be back and bringing friends."}
{"text":"The sushi here is pretty tasty. The prices aren't too bad if you get their specials that day too. I stopped going here completely though due to the service. I've ordered takeout maybe 3 times from them. Each time I spend at LEAST 20 minutes standing at the bar inside waiting for my food because the girls are too busy looking at their phones to wait on anyone. Last time when she finally graced me with the presence of her eyes, she went back to her phone for 10 more minutes. I waited THIRTY MINUTES until I walked out of the door. The sushi isn't that good."}
{"text":"Amazing Sushi and drinks!! Great atmosphere... Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"The best place in Kent for sushi.  Affordable, clean, nice waitresses, well prepared martinis at a great price."}
{"text":"Sushi was not good. Made me sick. We were also the only ones in the restaurant. Bad service. Would not recommend this place for sushi. Although this place is fun on Friday nights and Saturday nights when you're going out drinking."}
{"text":"157 Lounge is by far the classiest place in downtown Kent.  The inside is very modern and simplistic, but stunning compared to other bars in the area.  There's plenty of seating both at the bar and around the walls, if you so choose.  The major perk of 157 is that it's one of the only bars in Kent to have a dance floor, and a good one at that.  Drink prices here are a bit steeper than at other bars, but that's probably because you're paying for the environment.  They only have a few beers on tap, but that's because they specialize in cocktails and martinis.  And they don't skimp on the booze in the mixed drinks.  On a random note, one of my favorite things about this place is that they serve moscato by the glass.  That's VERY rare in a restaurant, nevermind in a bar.  The crowd here is mixed.  While it is a classy place, a few slobs manage to get through the front door, which ruins the vibe a bit (Really?  Do you need to wear your Batman shirt to the bar?  That's a great way to get the ladies).  Unfortunately, the higher-class atmosphere attracts a fair share of students who look like they belong on the Jersey Shore.  As such, I don't really find myself here late night on Fridays or Saturdays.  Just not my scene.  If you go earlier in the evening, it is a nice place to grab a fairly made drink.  The fish tank is very pretty, too."}
{"text":"Hip and trendy, overpriced, douchey atmosphere, look for fights outside, not bad for young college kids looking for a good time, and a place to meet people"}
{"text":"Most likely place to spot Snookie or The Situation in Kent. My vajayjay feels nice and fresh due to the sheer number of douches."}
{"text":"This update is written regarding 157's latest addition: Sushi.  I know what you are thinking, sushi?!  In Kent?!  In the martini bar in Kent?! I know, I had the same reaction.  But I met a friend...I gave it a shot and ordered 2 rolls. And then we ordered more. And then we ordered more.  Well done 157! After the disappointment that was Dancing Beta in Kent -- I didn't think decent sushi could be found in the area -- but you did it!  I had some great rolls (I can't remember their names and their website isn't updated yet, but I'm pretty sure I had a shrimp crumble, spicy tuna, a tiger, and some other animal name).  Plus accompanied with the same great wine and martini service.   Proud of you 157, I'm still not sure how the sushi bar will mesh with the late night crowd -- but it was delicious and I am glad I came by to try!"}
{"text":"Recommend the sushi burrito.    A lot more product for not much more in price!    ?? !!!!"}
{"text":"If you want to live a South Beach fantasy in the middle of Ohio, this is the place to do it. The interior is beautiful and modern. However, as far as nightlife goes, the DJs are weak and the place gives the vibe that it takes itself way too seriously, especially in a divey, blue collar city like Kent."}
{"text":"Bouncers are outrageous bounced for lookin at him wrong and puched in the face... drinks were ok... 50/50 your glass is clean. down town kent has much better to offer."}
{"text":"The sushi was surpisingly really good as my husband and I have not found anything that compares to Otani's. Although the prices were very reasonable, they're not the same as there online menu states. Also we ordered appetizers that we thought were 1/2 off but didn't read the fine print. So pay close attention to their advertisements and what they end up charging you. We really enjoyed the sushi so will be back!"}
{"text":"The service here is absolutely terrible. The sushi is alright. The manager is a huge asshole and is very creepy. The night life here is also rocky. You could get your ID taken away even if you are of age and they blast it on their social media pages. Letting your information be everywhere. 2 stars is generous. The service is terrible but the sushi isn't bad."}
{"text":"Sushi. DJ. Bouncers. Fake fancy decor. Fake looking chicks. College town. What was I expecting?   Sushi is okay. Service is slow."}
{"text":"Yes I have been in here several times. Wow the place is terrible. It's got an intense creepy frat boy vibe. Don't go for the sushi, don't go for the drinks, don't go for the music, but if you're looking for that sausage party on Molly and steroids hot spot this is your bar."}
{"text":"Okay so I was a little nervous to eat sushi here just because I have been there when it first opened just to drink. When I arrived it was pretty quite and the service was quick. I ordered 4 sushi rolls and the grilled mussels (which I have never had mussels previous to this) which I did a carry out order. The mussels were great and whatever sauce they put on top of it was amazing (garlic?)! The sushi rolls were very interesting, one had apple in it  and my favorite was sweet potato,red pepper, cream cheese and salmon. I would for sure come back and let people know about this gem! Price for the sushi is great as well."}
{"text":"Fun to visit on Thirsty Thursdays after midnight when there's a large crowd. Sometimes is dead empty since Panini's has opened down the street. Ordered the same drink twice and was charged more $ depending on the bartender"}
{"text":"The service for sushi is a bit slow and awkward. I hope that with this new addition to the menu will become a smoother process. It's a fun place to go dancing at night, and their drinks are tasty!"}
{"text":"Was not very happy with my sushi! So small when I pay less than half that at other locations...bummer."}
{"text":"I love 157 Lounge. By far the best place to go to in Kent. Best Music, Best Drinks, Best Service."}
