{"text":"We stopped in on a Friday night for dinner. We ordered the burger and crab stuffed salmon with Brussels and Lobster Mashed potatoes. Everything was delicious especially the lobster mashed potatoes (huge pieces of lobster) and the burger. As far as drinks go the cocktails were good but they were out of a lot of the beer."}
{"text":"Sunday was my first visit to Nest and I was very pleased. The atmosphere was classy but chill. The food was good. I had the omelette and a waffle. My friends had steak and eggs I believe and the red velvet chicken and waffles. Our plates were empty! That speaks volumes! The staff was very pleasant also. I asked to speak with one of the owners just to let him know how much I enjoyed the restaurant and he was very nice and appreciative of our feedback.  I was quite  impressed with the whole experience. I hope this restaurant lasts because I enjoyed my time there and love supporting Black-owned businesses. I will definitely be returning sooner than later."}
{"text":"Very good experience. Had the Chicken and Red Velvet Waffle. You will be pleased! Very beautiful environment and great service by oir waiter Dee."}
{"text":"Time to get our food? 1 star. On a night with maybe one other table to serve, it took more than 45 minutes. Can't totally blame the chef, though, since there seemed to be only one person working the kitchen. Wild.
But the hostess was amazing, didn't catch her name.
And our server, Bailey, was also great. Very sweet and accommodating.
Food deserved about 4 stars, but definitely good. Fresh fish and perfect portions.
Nice atmosphere all around, but the wait time was so frustrating."}
{"text":"Awful! Poor service. Long wait. Mediocre food ...actually I don't even want to waste even MORE  time on this place by having to leave a review. Just awful, get it together, do some research on the line of business that you're in, invest in quality chefs, bartenders etc. Don't  run out of food that's listed on the menu, and don't serve undercooked food."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Had the skirt steak with chimichurri  over brussel sprouts and it was INCREDIBLE!!! Hubby had the shrimp and grits and said they were fabulous! I will be back and I'm bringing ALL my friends! You all should get here too!"}
{"text":"The food at this place was awesome. I ordered the chicken and waffles and the chicken was fresh out of the pan!! The waffle was soft and moist! The staff accommodated the large group I was with! The place is new and the scene definitely has good music (r&b and hip hop)."}
{"text":"If you have a lot of time on a Saturday this is the place for you.  Brunch: food was actually good.  We (party of 10) all liked the food. 
They were overwhelmed with having business.  There were 3 other tables eating.  Service: clueless.  Ordered iced tea and got it 45 minutes into meal after asking 4 times.  Food for our party was delivered over 20 minutes. Some were finished when the last meal arrived. The servers were beautiful and friendly but did not know if they had unsweet tea or how to get us coffee with our brunch waffles. They had No sense of urgency (my water was never refilled).  No one visibly in charge."}
{"text":"The staff needs to get it together here. I came with a group of 6 and we're damn near reseated three times. When we walked in, the lady at the booth told us we could sit anywhere. Once we're seated a gentleman approaches my group to say we shouldn't be sitting there, and are reseated at a different section. Once we're reseated again, a third employee approaches us asking if we \"paid\" for the section, that line of questioning is unacceptable and I really feel as though the staff needs to communicate better. The drinks are overpriced with quality that is served. Way too much ice in the cups, the bartenders are slow, so either lack experience or aren't motivated to get drinks out faster. My first time and more than likely my last time here, especially considering the experience I had tonight."}
{"text":"I've always tried to support this location through the many different restaurants/businesses that have held this space. So, I went to support the newest restaurant in this space, Nest. A couple of friends of mine held a small networking event here, and the only patrons in the restaurant at the time were the 10-15 of us who attended the event. I heard from a few people that arrived before me that they all ordered fries and had to wait a while because the chef had not arrived yet. 

I ordered a drink and was told they couldn't make the one I requested because they didn't have all of the ingredients. I ordered a different one, and the bartender made it exactly the way I liked it. She was very friendly. 

I was starving, so I ordered the chicken wings. Although, I felt they were a bit overpriced at $15. 4 other patrons ordered shrimp and grits and we played an ice breaker game for about 30- 35 mins. During the game, we had to request that the air conditioning be turned on because it was so hot and everyone was sweating. 

After we finished the game, we realized we still did not have our food. They went to go check, and came out with the shrimp dishes. Then I was told that \"THERE WAS AN ERROR WITH THE CHICKEN\" so I would have to order something else. What does that even mean? If I was unable to get the chicken, why was I not told that almost 40 minutes before when I made my order for the chicken wings? Being that I was starving and it took so long to get the original orders, I chose not to believe that it would only take 10 minutes to prepare anything else. 

There was barely an apology, and I was told they couldn't even comp my one drink for the inconvenience. I left and went to Morton's. I wish that I could say how the food was, but I never received any. My hope for them is that they will get better service, better customer service, and not end up like all of the previous businesses that have occupied this space."}
{"text":"My gf and I visited this spot on Saturday night for live jazz and overall we had a good experience with a few kinks. When we arrived, the music was already in session and there were a few open two top tables up front near the band in the lounge area. My first thoughts that if I were a hostess I would have tried to fill those tables first; especially since the band was the attractration for the night.   Instead, the hostess lead us the dining area in the back to a quaint table for two. While the dining area was nice,  it wasn't really in eye sight of the band so we asked to be moved to the lounge area; which the hostess did with no problem.  

After sitting, she ook our drink order. I ordered sparkling Rose which was amazingly good at a $6 per glass price point. My gf ordered a Long Island Iced tea which was fairly priced at $11; but it was strong yet tasty! After our drinks,  she said our waitress would be with us momentarily. After sipping our drinks, reading the menu and listening to the band for a good 15 mins; our waitress still had not shown up. Finally,  our hostess comes back and apologizes saying that the waitress had told her she had already taken our order; which clearly wasn't true.  As such,  the hostess took our order and gave us one round of drinks on the house to make up for the long wait. She definetly got cool points there!

 For dinner, I ordered pepperoni flat bread pizza and handcut fries. My gf ordered the whole fried Red Snapper which came with one side.  So she ordered roasted red potatoes and an additional side of brussel sprouts. The food came out promptly and the presentation was great.  The flat bread pizza was very cheesy and had plenty of sauce but could have used a bit of seasoning; perhaps a bit of garlic salt to kick it up a notch. As a self proclaimed French fry connoisseur lol, when I order handcut fries that's what I expect to get.  Instead what I received was regular out of the bag frozen straight cut fries.  I will say they were cooked perfectly but they were definitely not handcut fries. The whole red snapper was fried perfectly and looked great.  However,  it lacked seasoning. After adding a bit of hot sauce,  meat was more flavorful. However, we would have preferred to really enjoy the fish without having to add hot sauce to give it more flavor. The roasted red potatoes were good; as well as the brussel sprouts which were served shaved as a nice twist.  

All in all,  I think this is a really nice spot. Great ambiance with perfectly priced and yummy drinks.  I'd like to see the food expand a little but we'll definitely give this place another try!"}
{"text":"First time ever walking into a spot in Uptown on a Saturday during brunch and it was me and 2 other people at 1pm. Worked for me since I wanted to chill and listen to music while I did some writing.

Food was decent, had grit tots for brunch with eggs and a chicken wing since I was advised I had to have the chicken. Wing was definetly seasoned but super salty. Brunch menu seemed super \"simple\" whereas based on reviews it sounds like dinner must be where it's at. Server was nice and I had no issues with the customer experience. 

Atmosphere is cool, vibrant, I can see why promoters throw parties here. Its a big place, tvs, and a bar. Hopefully they can attract foot traffic here and get a steady flow."}
{"text":"This restaurant has such so much potential. I love the location, and how newly renovated it looks. The few things that will hurt this place is that it is below condos which prohibit them from playing loud music(In the event someone wants to plan a party there). 

There was an event held at this restaurant. There wasn't enough staff to help with the amount of people at the event. Some people were behind the bar and we had absolutely no idea what they were helping with. 

Once we were finally helped we had to order two or three drinks at a time plus our food because we were afraid that if the bartender walked away it would take another 15-20mins to come back. Finally, she received more help and things got better. I asked one bartender to put in my food order and something told me to confirm 10mins later and just as I thought the food was not put in and I had to order take out."}
{"text":"This place is the worst. Extremely awful loud music. Food is not good at all. Terrible service. Not very clean. On and On. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Food: I had the chicken and waffles which were very flavorful. The waffle was Pecan and vanilla flavored with powered sugar on top, pure perfection nice crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The chicken was well seasoned although you only get two wings they were a pretty descent size.  My friend got French toast with fresh fruit and it was pretty good as well. The grits were bland and needed salt also not super creamy

Parking: we found parking on the side streets although parking is across for $15 no thank you.

Service was impeccable Mo was a gentlemen who greet us with a smile and our waitress was so nice and attentive and on it.

It's only 4 stars because I would need to go back when it's busier and not at an event.  Overall first time good experience."}
{"text":"This was my first visit at this restaurant. We were celebrating my sister's birthday. The ambiance was nice & there was a band playing/singing. The appetizers/drinks were great yet the service was extremely slow! My issue was I waited 40 minutes or longer for my entree and everyone else at my table had been served. When I complained to the manager, she was very curt, somewhat abrasive, & didn't offer any explanation as to why, etc. When  the waitress arrived with my food, the manager's response was \"You have your food now. I can take off 20 % on your bill. Are there any other problems?\" The manager walked away. How RUDE! Long story short, I sent the meal back. I will NEVER visit here again."}
{"text":"The food is great! So far we've tried the burger, salmon, and shrimp alfredo. We've dined in once and gotten takeout once and had great service both times. There was a mix-up with the shrimp alfredo during our dine-in, but was taken care of promptly and courteously by the staff. They also comped us the surcharge for the shrimp. I will echo a previous review that unfortunately the restaurant is not located in a high foot-traffic area, but we hope the business does well and is here to stay.

Don't forget that if you live in the condos upstairs you get 20% off food items!! Makes for very reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"To preface this review, I want to note this is a hard venue to fill. It's a large space (so high rent) in an area without a lot of foot traffic. As a resident of this building, I've seen places come and go. Owners keep trying to make this an upscale restaurant and lounge, but that simply doesn't work in this spot. 

And unfortunately, Nest has fallen into the same pattern. We went here twice over the opening weekend and were somewhat disappointed. For the most part, the menu is overpriced comfort food. I had the Nest Burger with Mac & Cheese and my boyfriend had the Shrimp & Grits with vegetables. 

I asked for my Burger to be done medium-well and it was well-done, slightly burnt and very dry. The Mac & cheese was an interesting choice... Very oily with a glob oh cheese on top. It was more of a Mac with cheese than a Mac & Cheese. 

The Grits were alright, but not really worth the price.

Nest's saving grace are the delicious drinks! I love the natural soda mixes. I'll definitely be stopping by for the drinks!"}
{"text":"Went online to look at the hours of operation. Their actual website says it's open on Sundays for brunch 9am-3pm. Made a reservation for mother's day at 2pm and we get there and it's closed. I never leave reviews but this has me pissed. Gotta do better guys."}
{"text":"Really nice i have been twice the staff and the owner where all really nice. Had a little hiccup at the beginning but the owner cleared everything up and made it right so the place gets 5 stars from me. The food was really good better than any place in that area. I will def be back and i def recommend it"}
{"text":"Cancelled my reservations for my birthday dinner, a few hours before the event. They did not even have the decency to call me, and sent the cancellation via text. I called to see what the reason was, and the response is that we can not accommodate 17 people. I should've known to look elsewhere because they rarely answer the phone. Unprofessional business!"}
{"text":"I just left the establishment and my experience was not pleasant. 1. We made reservations for 8 o clock., when we got there the host couldn't find the reservation in the system. 2. Our server never introduced herself she just took our order after another employee sat us down and served us water along with that she didn't check on us for anything. After an hour of waiting she never checked on us to make sure we were okay. When she finally brought one dish over for one person(who's my fiancé) of a party of four, the food was COLD. 3. A few parties that showed up after us got their food BEFORE US....WE SAT FOR AN HOUR FOR MY FIANCÉ TO RECEIVE COLD FOOD...."}
{"text":"The decor is beautiful. I had great ambience with my meal. I had the Crab Stuffed Salmon with the Brussel Sprouts. My boyfriend had the Porkchop special with Lobster Mashed Potatoes. We couldn't resist picking off each other's plate. This place will certainly be one of my new favorites. I will suggest everyone to dine here. You will not be disappointed! Great seafood options and exceptional service. Bailey was our server and she was very knowledgeable about the menu and accommodating, but also personable and sweet."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and had the chicken and red velvet waffle which was amazing! The service was very friendly and the decor is nice! I would come back to eat or just lounge!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a wonderful atmosphere the food has room for improvement. Other than that it's a great place downtown to hold a party or simply go dine in."}
{"text":"Tried to check this place out, but they were not open when we made our reservation. 8:00PM reservation made from yelp app. Got to the restaurant and the doors were locked."}
{"text":"3 stars for the food and Zero for the services. The entire place is empty and food took forever.  Arne snapper was the best. Steak was cut into and that's not how to sever a steak."}
{"text":"Great place to come in from the cold and relax with a glass of wine and meal with friends. Perfect for your uptown date night! 

Recommend the burgers. Quality of food was great and was very pleased with the pricing. Especially on the drinks. 

My new uptown fav! Def going there for  New Years Eve Event."}
{"text":"My friend lives above the restaurant and we went to check it out last night. The restaurant is HUGE and I'll be interested to see how they will utilize all the space. Staff was super great, service was excellent and the food was super good. Menu wasn't very large and over all basic... nothing fancy but all well prepared and well dressed. I had the fried chicken breasts and they were amazing!!!! Came with two gigantic chicken breasts that were moist, tender, well seasoned with a perfect light breading that didn't overwhelm and was not greasy. I could barely finish one and brought the other home and BF said DAMN this is good chicken!!! Friend had the burger which was also huge and looked really good. I recommend checking this newcomer out and going with an open mind while it figures out it's place in uptown. I could feel a lot of heart and soul went into the place."}
