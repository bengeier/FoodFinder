{"text":"Horrible service, wrong food from what we ordered and then the waitress argued with us about our order, manager said he would fix our bill, but we ended up paying more. Calling GM on Monday."}
{"text":"Optimally I'd only rate it 3.5 stars, but our server was so friggin nice. We've come here about 5 times now in the last year. Usually when we get there the hostess, who's always different, seems either high or just totally spaced out. Unfortunately that sets the tone for how things are to pan out from then on. I can't tell if they want their servers to wear whatever they please, but there were two of them walking around half naked and the bus boy looked like he just got out of bed.
As far as the service itself, Angelita was so nice. It was like being served by mom. Now we did have to wait a bit but no longer than 5 minutes.
The food was good, but I also have to put it this way, it's Mexican food. If anyone has high expectations of Mexican then you're probably also writing critiques of Mcdonalds. Tortilla,cheese, meat... Taco, chimichanga, enchilada, burrito, taquito... slap some rice and beans on the side. I don't think I've had ever Mexican and been like, \"WOW, HOLY CRAP THIS IS THE BEST MEXICAN FOOD I'VE EVER HAD!!!!\" and I don't think I ever will. It's not like it's gourmet.
Overall, I'd recommend this. I personally came out here from North Carolina and it really does remind me of a few of the Mexican restaurants I used to haunt."}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican sit down restaurant. More on the Americanized side but still flavorful and tasty. I like that authentic Mexican food better though."}
{"text":"Very underwhelming food, and the service is terrible.  I used to be a Top Shelf fan, but no more.  If you want to go to a Mexican themed sports bar, then this is your place.  Otherwise, seek out another place that actually cares about quality food and customer service."}
{"text":"Carol served me. I had a great experience. The chili reallno was the bomb and the Long Island was off the chain. Perfect service."}
{"text":"I used to really like this restaurant and would go almost bi-weekly for their Ultimate Nachos. Girlfriends and I got together regularly specifically for the nachos and margaritas but the last few times I've went there I've been really unsatisfied. Service isn't that good, the margaritas are too pricey for the sizes and not to mention how little alcohol there is in them and the nachos have been disgusting and much smaller the last 3 or 4 times I've gone. I'm not sure if there's new management or what exactly the difference is resulting in the changes, but it's not somewhere I go anymore and I probably won't ever go back unless I hear good things from other people. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this place is the outside patio. The chips and salsa were good and fresh tasting. My burrito was so so as well as what my husband had.  I think just hanging on the patio having cocktails is what I would return for."}
{"text":"Top shelf is our go to for Mexican food.  The staff is friendly.   Patio dining.  I absolutely love the fact that there are low calorie and light options at a Mexican restaurant.  Great margaritas and chips and salsa as well."}
{"text":"I have always had a good time at Top Shelf, but last nights visit proved different.  Are server was preoccupied with a baby at the bar then taking care of his customers.  I ate 2/3 of my dinner without anything to drink because he didn't check on us.  My food was cold and my tacos were so greasy that the grease was pouring out the bottom and the shells fell apart. While still finishing my undelightful  dinner, the server finally asked if we needed anything else or wanted desert.  I asked for water and my husband asked for more tea.  It took over 5 minutes to get the drinks.  My husbands tea glass was completely packed with ice and 2/3 full with tea, there was so much ice that he could not even mix a sweet n low in it. I will try one more time, but think I may have to love on to somewhere else."}

[Excerpt Taken From Full Review]
The Food:
Ahh the food.  Top Shelf has some pretty authentic, delicious Mexican food.  I have ordered a number of things there - from an al a carte burrito, to the taco salad, a chimi, the plain chicken sandwich, to the mini-chimis.  Everything we've ordered has come out to specification and has been quite delicious, but since this is a Mexican food restaurant, I think it's best to start with the chips and salsa.

The chips and salsa at Top Shelf are pretty darn good.  Not too chunky, not too runny, their corn chips are fried fresh and are usually served very hot.  They also have a pretty tasty hot salsa available at no charge upon request.  The best salsa I usually have consists of mixing the mild with the hot and coming up with my own concoction, but it's all pretty good - and being free makes it that much sweeter.

For this visit, I had the shredded beef (machaca) burrito, al a carte.  This actually sounds like a fairly lonesome order.  A burrito arriving alone on a plate with only a few shreds of lettuce to keep it company...I can see how that might be misleading.

But let's get something straight:  This is not some Taco Bell burrito.  This is a real burrito.  This burrito weighs a good 2lbs and is stuffed full of spicy, delicious machaca beef.  It's hot and juicy and each bite is overflowing with flavor.  I usually jokingly refer to it as a \"protein tube\" because of all the beef in it.  Top Shelf usually offers to prepare the burro in a number of ways including fundido style, with sour cream, deep fried (chimi style), but I usually just get it plain.  I like it that way.

My wife ordered the \"mini chimi\" platter.  The MC platter can be ordered with either beef or chicken, but almost everyone I know, including my wife, usually gets the \"half and half\" style which combines 4 chicken and 4 beef.  

The MCs are delicious, but pretty standard.  They are deep fried, smothered with cheese, tomatoes, and green onions, and served with beans and sour cream for dipping.  Each bite is piping hot and goes well with the sauces, plain, or even with the salsa.  I'd like to mention that Top Shelf does not charge extra for the beans and sour cream to dip in.  That's important to note because another local Mexican food place (Manuel's) actually charged us $1.75 for a side of sour cream to dip our mini chimis in.  This is usually \"Ok\" but we were never notified that ordering this sour cream came at nearly a $2 cost."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for Mexican food and have been going here for years. I usually order the same thing, so haven't tried everything on the menu. I don't know why, but the newer Top Shelf in Peoria just doesn't taste the same. The lunch menu is very reasonable and there's always coupons to be found in the flyers in the mail...although I think the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Food was not bad and the prices were comparable. However  some of the staff is not caring or courteous. Our waiter was a complete ass to my bfs daughter. Rolling his eyes and exuding hatred for his job when taking her order. We were in a hurry and left the table after 10+ minutes of waiting for the check. We stood at the hostess stand waiting for her to bring him back. He did not realize we were standing there when he looked with disgust at our table and then rolled his eyes severely annoyed before showing great surprise when he looked up at my bf standing in front of him. He was a dick!

Besides him, good times"}
{"text":"I came just for a drink or two, and I decided to sit outside on the patio area. The server at the bar, Maureen, was wonderful! Very welcoming and she created a great atmosphere! I recommend coming here! Especially if you want great service."}
{"text":"Sloppy server, makes you wonder about the kitchen if they allow you to see the unkept servers.  Our server had a ripped shirt and there were others with old food stuck to their uniforms.  The food was just okay.  The restrooms stink to high heaven.  Don't think I will be back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"Good food, nice relaxing authentic atmosphere. The staff is friendly.  I like their chimichangas."}
{"text":"Don't drink the water... or eat the food. I got serious, serious food poisoning from this place."}
{"text":"i like this restaurant for their lunch prices and atmosphere. the restaurant is decorated nicely, but i love the bar area. the bar area is separate and has alot of tables and booths and 2 walls of plasmas. it is not just a bar. it's a great place to sit and watch sports and have drinks and food. the full menu is offered in the bar area. so, if you want a full meal and/or drinks during any kind of sports game, the bar area is the place to sit. they offer an inexpensive lunch menu. i think it's around $6.50 for a large lunch. there's different options. you can also use the buy one get one free coupons that are in the entertainment book for the lunch specials making it really cheap. if you just want drinks, you can still get chips and salsa for free. i think the food is a good quality and is similar to macayos or garcias. good all around place. they are also building a large smokers patio with outdoor dining. it should be close to completion."}
{"text":"The Burrito Fundito is pretty good, and the portion is HUGE!  The flan, however, was terrible.... bummer."}
{"text":"So I am a regular at this restaurant. I order one specific thing every time. This visit was sad to say the least. I had a new waitress. I ordered my food the way I always order it the same way. On this visit my waitress could not get my order correct. My food came out  wrong. I sent it back it came out Wrong again. I told the waitress it was wrong she proceeded to get the manager. The manager walked over to my table with an attitude and said, \"what do you want?\"  I proceeded to tell her and she said I can't order it that way. I have been ordering it that way for a long time. She brought me my food finally. Although she has now lost a regular for the restaurant. My regular waiters/waitresses I am sorry your female manager with tattoo on her arm was so rude. I am taking my money else where!"}
{"text":"We do not go out to eat often but when we do this is our choice.  Always good service and food.  I do not think we have ever received something wrong with our food or the wrong order.  Staff has always been pleasant and cheerful!"}
{"text":"No gluten free menu. Sauces all have flour in them. Waiter wasnt real sure if chips were all corn or a blend. Hot sauce very tasty. Prefer to stick with restaurants that choose to cater to gluten free rather than guessing."}
{"text":"The service here is fantastic. My bartender Danielle was efficient and pleasant. Josh the manager took time to suggest menu options and was very personable; he knew his stuff. 
I love the patio bar. Would come here to watch football except: 
One big negative: the tv above the outside bar is old, small, and blurry. With the price of big screens having come down so much they can't update?"}
{"text":"poorest Mexican food ever! Being from San Diego, I know good Mexican food.
Wish I'd read reviews before I wasted my time. And......the name TOP SHELF for
a Mexican restaurant ? Really? Had good server, however."}
{"text":"This has been a semi-regular stop for my friend and myself...   We enjoy the muzzled atmosphere and the proximity.  The food is bland, but they make up for it with mediocre drink choices.  The prices are alright, as long as you do not have anywhere else to go.  Sometimes, there is a karaoke disc jockey who has a rather inadequate selection of songs, but makes the best effort to play what is requested... even if it is the wrong song.  If you are in the square block, give this place a shot."}
{"text":"The food here is perfecto and the chips and salsa are very addictive. My favorite is the muchaco tacos and a margarita. We always get great service in the bar area. However the hostess ladies for the dinning room can bd hit or miss. So unless you have to sit in the dinning room I suggest the bar area! Oh ya, try the green chili burro, it rocks."}
{"text":"Our waitress was super nice! she was on it on refilling our drinks and keeping the chips and salsa stocked ! i didn't get a meal but everyone's meal looked super tasty! I will definitely be back to try the food! 4 stars for great service and that fifth star will be determined when I try some food  !!"}
{"text":"People that rate Top Shelf, don't understand it.

If you go here, don't sit on the non bar side unless you have to.  The bar side is where its at...its a Mexican sports bar, if you want authentic Mexican food, don't come here.  Come here to watch the game and snack on chips and salsa.

The best items on the menu are the fajitas and the fajita fundido burrito.  I prefer steak, but chicken is fine.  Add jalepenos for more fun.  The chips are fresh and the salsa is the best I've had in the valley.

If you're drinking, skip the margaritas on the menu and order the Million Dollar Margarita...if you're a heavy drinker, two should give you a buzz, three will make you giggly...if you're a light drinker, be careful with one.

On the way out, grab one of the key lime mints."}
{"text":"We never have to wait for a table.  Service is always very friendly and fast.   Beef tacos are the best.  Tonight my wife and I were not super hungry and they split one dinner onto two plates....perfect.   We keep coming back"}
{"text":"Food is good but service can be hit and miss . I recommend the tacos and taco salad, great margaritas and tall draft beers"}
{"text":"Service and food is average. Chips and salsa is hit or miss too. Most of the time the food is good, but rarely is it great, so we go here whenever were looking for quick sit down mexican meal that's nearby."}
{"text":"Top Shelf?  maybe Middle Shelf.

It's hit or miss when you're eating here.  Food is well........nothing like my favorite spots in Tucson, but okay.  Service is adequate as well.
 
The bar area is large with a nice sized patio.  Good drinks, service and did I mention they had an outside patio?  I enjoy drinking and eating outside on a nice patio.
  
If you think of Top Shelf as a nice neighborhood bar that serves food, then you've hit the nail on the head, however, if you think of it in the reverse, then you've missed the mark.  Nice place to hang out for a drink or two, three or four....just don't expect great food.

Would I go back again?  Sure, it's good to have a neighborhood bar within walking distance from home."}
{"text":"This is the second time my family and I have come to Top Shelf. Both times I haven't been disappointed. Both salsas (hot and mild) taste super fresh and the chips are hot, crispy and fresh too. The Carne asada tacos are delicious. The meat was flavorful and tender. The tacos were stuffed with meat and cheese. The guacamole that comes with the meal is always a plus. The service has been on point both times too. I think I've found my new favorite Mexican food restaurant. The cost for the Carne asada tacos is a little pricey ($15.95) but worth every bite."}
{"text":"Prices have gone up at way to much for the food and the service is not always good . I had to keep asking for drink refills and chips"}
{"text":"Should be called Bottom Shelf!  Top shelf margs were good, but the food was awful.  I ordered a la cart seafood enchilada and I needed a saw to cut the tortilla and the sauce tasted fresh out of the Old El Paso can.  My husband ordered an a la cart burro that tasted like school food.  It was a huge tortilla (definitely not fresh) and flavorless ground beef.   If you go, keep your expectations low.  This restaurant needs help."}
{"text":"We went to Top Shelf because we had a coupon from our Entertainment book for a buy one, get one free entree.  When we got to the restaurant, we hung out in the waiting area for a few minutes before the hostess came to seat us, but we enjoyed looking at the fish tank while we waited.  Our waitress was nice and kept our drinks filled and the food was pretty good, but maybe a little pricey for the portions.  When the bill came, we gave the waitress our coupon.  She brought back the bill and our kid's meal was the one given to us free.  When we asked, she said she tried to give us the second adult entree as the free meal, but the manager wouldn't let her.  She then had the manager come talk to us, but he wouldn't budge on the matter.  I have never been to a restaurant that considers a kid's meal to be an entree.  It seems this company is more concerned with making a couple bucks than good service that brings back return customers."}
{"text":"My daughter & I decided to go here (our 1st time) yesterday after our power went out on the hottest day of summer (114 degrees!) due to some downed power lines. SRP said it could possibly take 2 hours to repair & with our dinner not quite done cooking on the stove, we did not want to stay in the already hot house while the power was off.  As we skirted out the door, the power came back on but we decided to go anyway.  As we parked the car I realized I had forgotten something I wanted to bring to the restaurant.  So strike 2 for me....  I wondered what could happen in the restaurant that would be strike 3.  Happily... NOTHING!

We were greeted promptly at the entrance & seated right away.  There were a few other guests at other tables but soon after we were seated many people started showing up for dinner as well.  Our waitress, Carol, came over pretty quickly & asked how we were.  Without hesitation, I said, \"Flustered!\"  She asked why so I explained what led to that feeling.  Well, Carol was sweet & attentive & gave us a nice & very unexpected surprise which really made my night.  We both had the nightly special: cheese enchilada, beef taco with rice & beans all for $7.95 each, which I thought was a great price.  We both cleaned our plates & then decided to order the apple chimichanga for dessert.  Out came a huge plate with 2 chimichangas filled with big slices of apples, & 2 scoops of ice cream. Yum!

The food was good & filling & the prices of the other menu items seemed comparable to other restaurants.  But what made it a really good night & got me over my flustered feeling was how friendly & caring Carol was.

Thanks Carol!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Disgusting. So disappointed. Rocky Point shrimp salad is ice Berg lettuce, mini shrimp, awful tomatoes, mushy cheese in a taco shell for 15 bux. Guacamole was flavorless. Bartender full blast blender during national anthem.. Whole bar was respectfully listening and watching while the blender stole the show. So sad.. So close to home.. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Hands down the WORST service I've ever had today!! A few friends went in after a baby shower to have lunch and not only did the waitress get over half of the orders wrong, she blamed US for ordering wrong! I'm sorry, but I dine out quite frequently and I know how to order. 

So after the waitress had argued with us for the third time, we walked out.  WITHOUT having eaten any food. Now get this, 15 min later the police showed up at my door, with my young son and niece watching, and accused us of stealing alcoholic beverages!!! 

Our waitress should know that my husband nor I ordered ANYTHING alcoholic! They threatened to arrest my husband because he didn't know the names of the friends of friends who were there that didn't pay for said alcohol. This is absurd! And embarrassing when my neighbors are inquiring as to why the police are at my home! 

Save yourself some grief and skip this place!!!! Valle Luna is just down the street & their food is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Not authentic at all. The chimichanga I got was soggy and it was not worth the money at all. The only reason I'm giving the second star is because our server was great."}
{"text":"Sorry but I've had better burritos at Filiberto's at half the price and twice the size.  $14 for a Burrito the size of a mini taco.  You gotta be kidding me.  The $7.60 Macho Margarita should be called Watered Down Fruity Margarita. The complimentary chips were so thin they break into little pieces as soon as you touch them.   Very very disappointing.  However I did like their salsa and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"I really like this place, however tonight was the worst service we have had in a while. It took over 40 minutes to get our food, the place was very dirty, our server stepped on a balled up place mat, stopped and looked down, them kept walking. She never mentioned one thing about why the food took so long.  I really hope this is not becoming the norm. If it is, there are other places to get Mexican food."}
{"text":"This is a sad excuse for a Mexican restaurant. We ordered the chicken fajitas, which seemed to be microwaved due to half of the chicken was cold and the other half hot. Didn't even come on a sizzling platter like all Mexican restaurants do. The portion was very small, the sides that came on the same plate were very small, and had only two tortillas. To top it off they have the audacity to charge $15.99 for this pile of tasteless dog food. I have never experienced such terrible food and felt like I got ripped off. I will never go back and highly suggest that nobody eats there"}
{"text":"Pretty ordinary except for the frozen margarita which was tasteless.  The food is OK - nothing special although the red chili was good once I let it escape from an overly large, heavy flour tortilla.  Chips are OK, salsa is dull.  Service however was friendly and efficient (which is why I gave 3 stars instead of 2) Maybe they're just inconsistent because a couple of months ago, I thought the food was pretty good, but after this week's experience, I'll start looking for better Mexican food in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Not sure where the previous low scores came from. The salsa and guacamole was amazing. I had the Burrito Fundito (I believe is what it was called) for my entree. This was incredible. I drank local draft that was amazing. Amanda B. served us and we will ask for her section anytime we return."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Haven't been there in a while. The food is decent but nothing to rave about. One of my friends claims she got food poisoning from the fish tacos. The margaritas are good but other than that, the food is pretty standard and so is the service."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood Mexican restaurant.  The place can get very busy, but the staff is always courteous and timely.  We like to get beans with the jalepeno cheese on top for a dip to have with our chips."}
{"text":"Love the chips and salsa and the burrito fundido.  Good price for very good food"}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars, I would. The food was terrible, the service was slow and the place was so dirty. The floor looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in weeks.  I went against my instinct to walk out right when were seated because it was my first time there and I really wanted to give it a chance, but I was completely disappointed in this place. I have no idea how it's always busy."}
{"text":"We had heard this was a a bad place but it's so close, we couldn't NOT try it.  Our mistake.  The food was ok in that chain Mexican way. But the frozen margarita was awful.  I actually sent it back--and I never do that.  It had no flavor and no alcohol. It should have been a clue when the waitress asked if I'd ever had one there before (when I ordered).  She later told us that they get a lot of complaints about the frozen variety.  Not good for a place called Top Shelf!"}
{"text":"I would give this place two to two and one half stars. My family has eaten here a few times and overall it seems to be about average. Fajitas usually have too much black pepper and the tortillas are too thick. The chips and salsa are good. Service is hit and miss and the kid's meals are a bit expensive. There are better and worse Mexican food restaurants to eat at in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We have been to Top Shelf a handful of times and the food has always been outstanding. We like the chimichangas and can not leave without sharing some fried ice cream. Also, ask for the \"hot\" salsa. It is not too spicy but has a much better flavor than the standard one. The last time we went there our waitress was horrible and very inattentive. I actually had to get up from my table, go interrupt her ten minute conversation with another customer who she was friends with to ask her for our check. Other than that one isolated incident we have been very pleased."}
{"text":"The food absolutely sucks, orders fajitas they came out on a white plate. Really, fajitas are to be served on a skillet. Get it together."}
{"text":"This is the worst place, do not waste your time or money. Food is never correct and the service is lousy. The only reason they stay in business is because there isint any other restaurants in the area. Drive right past this place and go to the Top Shelf on 35th Ave and Greenway if you want Mexican food or just go across the street and eat at Camerinos ( not a sit down but at least the food will be correct ) You'll be glad you did"}
{"text":"Great food, good atmosphere, good service. Had chicken and steak fajitas, both meats were juicy and flavorful. Could have been a little cleaner, some chip crumbs in our booth and a cart of dirty dishes/glasses was left out in the open. Otherwise great experience."}
{"text":"Finally good Mexican food. Loved the spicy salsa and skinny margaritas. My new go to for good burros"}
{"text":"Terrible service and SLOW! 1 hour and still waiting. 
Server was nearly non-existent and surely unhelpful. Inside the restaurant smelled like a gas station bathroom.  We sat outside and didn't matter to the staff at all.  Will never eat here again. $70 bucks for $20 dollar Bad Taco Bell food."}
{"text":"Good food & salsa for a chain type store"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre.  Sunday at 12:30 and there was really only one waitress and a trainee. A few large parties. Our \"quick\" bite to eat latest almost 2 hours.   Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly.  Liked all
the tv's at every table.  Made watching the football game enjoyable.  It took forever for our food to come out.  When it did, we thought it was average at best."}
{"text":"Wow! Had a great first 15 min. You know chips and salsa and a beer...then....45 min goes by and I have no food. I ask for a manger and she says its in the fryer. After 45 minutes my mini chimis are in the fryer?!?! Ridiculous, they were not even very busy. Lots of empty tables. If you're not very hungry it might be the place to go!  Unfortunately I was hungry and ended up leaving without eating."}
{"text":"The first time I went was really good, I had gotten beef and chicken tacos and they had gotten my order wrong, I think it was like two beef, then when they gave me another taco it was beef again and then the 4th taco they gave me was chicken. They didn't charge me extra and it was good so I had a great first experience but I have to say the more times I go back the more I'm not crazy about the food, price or the weird seating they have were the booths on the side are above other people and some make you face the people sitting on the ground level,  last time we spent half the time looking at the people 5 feet away from us because that's the way the table was facing. To be honest, if I can find another Mexican place she won't be picky about I don't think I'll make the drive here again. Plenty of parking spaces though and though I never go to the bar area those people seem to be having fund watching games and whatnot."}
{"text":"I went in for karaoke on two different nights, Friday had some interesting characters and was very entertaining. There were fewer people on Saturday, but it was still fun with my group of friends, and we were able to get through the rotation pretty quickly. 

On Saturday, I had the MLF margarita and shared an order of spinach artichoke dip. Both were good; I would order them again if I went back. Service at Top Shelf is terrible. Our waitress on Saturday told us there wasn't a drink menu, even though I ordered from one on Friday. She seemed genuinely confused by our requests for a pitcher of margaritas for the table, and brought two glasses for the four of us. Then, she had to consult with her manager to figure out what the pitcher options were. We waited about a half an hour for her to come back for my drink order, and walked past us several times. Finally, we literally had to yell at her to get her attention. When it came time for the tab, we planned ahead, knowing it could take 20 minutes for her to come back. Friday's service was slightly better, but not by much. On neither night was the bar area packed with people. 

I was happy with the value for my money; a 17 oz margarita was $6, I assume that at a bar, a small margarita would cost close to the same."}
{"text":"crappy food terrible service! the food sucked and the waiter was rude! dont go here unless you like to waste your money and hang out at a loud place! expensive food thats not worth it! ripp off they tried to sit me and my family in a 2 seat chair and we had 4 people! i had to ask 2 times for a booth and they were like trying to push the chairs on me! wth an"}
{"text":"First time here.  So close to our home we will be back.  Very friendly.  Great atmosphere.  Food was nothing spectacular but not gross either.  Drinks had a generous pour."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! 

Top Shelf may have taken the top spot for my favorite Mexican Food Restaurant. I always order the same meal no matter what Mexican restaurant I go to; a cheese quesadilla. That plus chips and salsa is all I need to really enjoy my meal!

As far as the quesadillas themselves I would say Top Shelf is at the same level as Macayos. But what has risen them above are their chips and salsa. The past 3 or 4 times I've gone to Top Shelf the chips have been fresh and WARM! I can't remember my chips ever being warm at Macayos. Nothing beats warm tortilla chips and salsa!

The waiters/waitresses are always nice when I go too. I'm horrible at remembering names but the last time I went our waitress was very sweet and had a smile on her face every time I saw her. 

I've only ever sat on the restaurant side but they also offer a bar with TVs.

If you like Mexican food I definitely recommend checking out Top Shelf for yourself!"}
{"text":"Food served here is about Dog grade . Nothing special .no flavors . Fish tacos were rubbish. Managed to eat little bit of rice and beans . And that was an assured way to spend the night in the bathroom . And $50.00 poorer. Stay away ."}
{"text":"Nice decor and a friendly staff greet you when you enter.  Our service was good.  The free nacho chips were light and not at all greasy.  The food was the disappointment here.  The beef in my combo plate was some kind of congealed mass.  It wasn't ground beef as you would expect in a taco.  It wasn't shredded beef either.  Nothing seemed to have much flavor.  Others at the table seemed to enjoy their meals.  I just can't give this place an A-OK (3 stars)."}
{"text":"This is one of those times that I'm utterly confused by the Yelposphere. This place doesn't warrant a 3/5 star rating; it's 5/5.

I've driven by this place several times but never thought about eating there. I had a $10 off coupon in one of those megacoupon books they sell every year, so I decided to hook up with a friend here tonight. 

First, the restaurant was very clean. The decor was slightly dated but definitely clean. It had carpet but no disgusting musty smell. The hostesses were polite and very welcoming. I was seated immediately and waited for my girlfriend to show up.

When my friend arrived, the server immediately took our drink orders and promised to bring us chips and salsa. He was really funny, and gave us tips on how to get the most bang for our buck for our meals. 

The chips were really fresh, and the hot sauce was a good spicy. The server gave us a double portion of it, and I couldn't stop eating it. We started off with the cheese crisp; the tortilla was nice and crispy. It came nicely covered in cheddar cheese. She ordered the chimichanga. I ordered a mix of both the shrimp and beef fajitas with light oil. Nom, nom, nom.

My fajitas had this medium bodied flavor that was perfect. It was a heaping portion but not too greasy. I didn't eat the tortillas and didn't miss them. This was so good I stopped eating midway because I have Weight Watchers on Tuesday. Otherwise, I would have licked my plate clean. My girlfriend said her chimi was the best she'd had in a long time. We both said we'd come back with our respective families.

We split the deep fried ice cream-only a cretin skips the DFI. It came in a beautiful ceramic bowl with matching? saucer. It was topped with honey, cinnamon, whipped cream, and maraschino cherries. I could have eaten all of it by myself. The honey and cinnamon only complimented the crispy shell and the vanilla ice cream. 

Long story short, skip Manuel's, Macayo's, or Garcia's. This place puts those others to shame."}
{"text":"Everything in the restaurant was awesome!! The food was very tasteful & you can tell that everything was barely made. I'm coming back!"}

A short story about the sad state of affairs on the west side...

It is pretty interesting when you can be AT a restaurant, and talking to a packed bar full of people IN the restaurant, about how much the restaurant sucks.

This was my experience the last time I was there.

Then why are we all sitting here!!??

That concludes my short story about the sad state of restaurant (especially Mexican) affairs on the West Side.

Their tortillas are just horrible.  Thick like door mats.  Tacos, OK.  The fajita quesadilla is supposed to be top notch, but at $15 bucks, I haven't tried it.

Go across the street to the Caminero if you want some darn good Mexican.  No booze there though, just solid Mex."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since I was about two years old. The waiters are friendly and helpful and have all been working there for quite some time. Going into the restaurant is like going into a family's home and having dinner with them. 

The food is amazing and well priced. Their combo dinners are HUGE and I often can't finish them. They also have some of the best salsa in the world. Locally owned and operated.

Try it."}
{"text":"Today was my wife and I anniversary we went to Top Shelf for lunch. Sydnee our server was great took good care of us. The food was out of this world #1 sub another tamale for taco.
Chips and salsa tasted good . All around great experience.
We have been going here for 30+ years and are very seldom have a bad experience.
Janice and Frankie keep up the good work
Thank you"}
{"text":"A group of us met for a co-workers birthday lunch today. Our server was pleasant and very on the ball. She split our ticket 8 ways with a smile. Everyone enjoyed their food. After reading some of these reviews, I was pleasantly surprised at how well the food tasted. We will defiantly be back. The rice and beans were my favorite on my dish. Not crazy about the salsa, it had a funny after taste. But over all a above average experience."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Burger and fries were dry. Fajitas we're cold. Rice and beans had no flavor."}
{"text":"Best salsa of my life! Great family friendly place and the bar is a great place to hang out and get margaritas any day of the week!"}
{"text":"reasonable prices. family oriented.food just average. they got great karaoke entertainment............which is why i keep coming back.

nothing negative i can say about the food but nothing special too about it. just AVERAGE........

i wont even dare go to this place if it didnt have karaoke cuz this place is DULL without karaoke. Well,maybe not if you come in big groups as this might offset the boredom.

Karaoke nights are on Friday and Saturday only so take heed.

Nice place for families as kids are allowed during karaoke and that is another reason why my group goes there with their respective families.

My wish is they should start karaoke earlier than 8pm to offset the long rotation for singing. It is family oriented anyway so why not have karaoke start say at 5:30 or at least 6pm?


This is honest unadulterated opinion........."}
{"text":"I have been eating here forever!  Since I was a kid!  The food is always good an the salsa is good but not the best I've ever had. The beans are eh.  I would give it 5 stars but last time I went our waitress ignored us and we had to get up and find her when we needed something.  Every other time the service was great. I have noticed the the staff gets a little older each year."}
{"text":"Food was good. Prices were average. Decor was out-dated. I got the chicken fajitas. It came with two small tortillas.  I asked for more and received another two. When the bill came, I learned I was charged for the \"extra\" tortillas. Seriously?"}
{"text":"This was the first time I've eaten here. The chips were not good, more like what you buy in the grocery store. The salsa was bland, I asked the waitress if they had anything hotter and she said she would bring us some but she never did. I had a shredded beef burrito with a side of guacamole. The beef had no flavor and the guacamole was looking dark, like on it's way to being spoiled so I didn't eat it. I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"I cant say anything bad.  From the hostess to our waiter top notch.   We all had the chimi.  So flavor full.   Excellent"}
{"text":"\"Another great night out with hubby\", I gave this neighborhood gem 4 stars because the bar side kicks butt ! The service is right on , friendly waiters, great atmosphere to hang with your BFF's and drink and watch the game :) The food is good , not great , nonetheless it's good . If you go , enjoy and let me know what you think ! Peace out all :)"}
{"text":"Ehhhh, this place was ok.  My food was decent.  I guess I was hoping to be more impressed.  In their defense, I love Mexican food, she it's tough to measure up."}
{"text":"Stopped here to get some carry out food for the super bowl. Seated ourselves at the bar. Bartender came over and greeted us within a few minutes.

We placed our order and decided to try one of their new prickly pear margaritas. They came with sugar on the rim instead of salt. I questioned the bartender about it since I really had wanted salt. She offered to get a new glass with salt instead. The drink was delicious! Definitely will come back for that.

We wondered out on the patio while we waited. Overall atmosphere was nice. In addition to the patio and bar area, there seemed to be two other dining areas. One that had three large tv screens.

We ordered a burrito with red and green sauce. Beef tacos with a side of rice, and a tostado dinner from the lite menu. Got our food within a reasonable amount of time, finished our yummy margaritas and headed home for the big kick-off.

Everything was packaged well and looked delicious. The burrito was huge with plenty of sauce. The beef tacos were good and came with a generous helping of rice. I liked that they offered a variety of choices under their lite menu options. The tostada I ordered was topped with shredded chicken, lettuce, tomato and black olive. It came with a salad and three large wedges of cataloupe. There was also a bag with tortilla chips and salsa. The chips were good. The salsa was okay. Would have preferred a hotter salsa.

Overall, good food and plenty of it! Will go there again."}
{"text":"We have been going to this Top Shelf location for many years. Up to this visit we have always had reasonably good service. This visit went so wrong. We were out with my daughter and her boyfriend. He ordered a hamburger and asked for it to be cooked medium rare. Well when it came out the burger was over cooked and looked very dried out. The reason that was given is that with the larger burgers it is too difficult to tell how done the burger and suggested cooking 2 small burgers instead of a big burger which is supposedly easier to control. Well when the plate came out there were 2 small (think McDonalds size) that were very dried out. The manager came out to see if the burger was any better. Our guest said a little but they were still not cooked as he he requested. She goes on to lecture him saying that they can't leave burgers at medium rare by state law. He said okay and didn't say anything more about it. The manager did comp his dinner, which was appreciated. But she told him he could still eat it if he wanted it. The manager started clearing away the dishes and took his plate while he was eating his fries! The kids were going to order dessert but neither the server or manager even asked if anyone wanted dessert. They just wanted us to leave. And nobody was causing a scene or raising their voice. There was no reason for the manager to be that rude. I can say with great confidence that we will never go back"}
{"text":"The only thing promising here was the fresh chips and salsa.  Other than that the food isn't that great.  Had to request a soft shelled taco, otherwise it'd come in a tacobell/del taco hard shell, not exactly mexican food.  The shredded beef was plain.  The green burro was wrapped in layers of tortilla which just made everything dry.  Even the pork inside was very dry, though saucy in the burrito itself, the pork was dry, dunno what zapped all the moisture out.  The only thing making it edible was the shredded beef, at least that was moist.  The cheese enchelada was pretty much all cheese."}
{"text":"Service was cool. Beer was icy. Sadly, the food left much to be desired. Ordered a carne asada burrito. The meat was horrible and chewy. I returned it and simply asked for one beef and one chicken taco. Beef taco was \"ok\". The chicken tasted like it was boiled, shredded and thrown i.  Zero flavor.   Service was good though. I gave up on the food, had one more cold beer and left."}
{"text":"Pretty standard run of the mill Tex Mex style Mexican food.   I ate the shredded beef Chimi.  Tasted Solid good beef.  Also ate the Chicken fajitas.  Not bad.  Not amazing.  But solid.  Salsa on table was a typical mixed canned tomato with fresh onion a chili salsa.  Not my favorite but didn't taste bad.  My beer was NICE AND BIG.   Prices were not cheap but not outrageous.

In the end there is a sea of Mexican food in the Phoenix area.  Are there better places out there?  Of course.  Are there worse.  Of course.

Waitress was nice.  Place was clean and the Air Conditioner in the middle of 105 degree day was cool..    Overall a solid place to eat.  But don't expect anything groundbreaking."}
{"text":"After checking with the server about ingredients, I had a terrible reaction to the food. Still sick a week later. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"I don't get all the bad reviews for this place. I have been there 10-12 times and has been pretty consistent. Good food, good service never had a problem. I guess some royalty gets upset when not catered to as such. Calm down, this stuff is good. Period. Sorry you had a bad time."}
{"text":"Foods ok ..... very pricey and I've been there 3 times and every time the service was bad. Anytime you have to ask for a refill is poor service, especially when they expect a tip."}
{"text":"Just alright. Salsa was good. Server was nice. The young hostess offered to seat us at the bar, dining area or the patio (I thought she was kidding as it was 115 degrees out). She was just doing her speech the way she was trained I guess. Food came quick enough and fresh. But still it was just alright. Place is out dated as well. Bench seats all worn and torn."}
{"text":"I've been going to Top Shelf restaurants since I used to go to the one in Mesa with my first husband in the 1980s.  Always liked the food, and when they added the lite menu, I gravitated toward that.  Mu husband and I have been to both of the westside ones.  We stopped going to the one on 83rd Avenue when we got horrible service there.  Tonight was Greenway and it was maybe worse.  When we got there, there were two groups of four waiting to be seated.  It was a little after 5 p.m. and a ton of open tables.  I asked if there was a waiting list, and the hostess said yes.  She said the wait would be 5-10 minutes, and we agreed to wait.  We reasoned there was a shift change going on.  After a few minutes, the first group of 4 was seated.  We were standing near the cash register when another group of three arrived.  My husband suggested we move aside so they could check in.  They were standing by the cash register when a waitress approached the group of 3 with menus and volunteered to seat them, which she did.  We turned to the group of 4 that was ahead of us and they were aghast.  We complained to the hostess and she said of the waitress, \"she's new.\"  The new waitress came up and said that \"he\" didn't know there were people waiting ahead of the group of 3 and so he seated them.  The woman with the group of 4 complained that they had been waiting, it was her husband's birthday and it was being ruined.  They got seated, and we continued to wait.  The waitress/hostess asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar.  We said no, and so she seated us at a table, but no one waited on us.  Someone took the drink order of the birthday group, but not us.  Our menus were closed because we knew what we wanted, but we were ignored.  Then I heard the waitress who seated the group of 3 ahead of everyone else take the food order of the group of 3.  I could not stand it anymore.  I gave my $5 coupon to the birthday group and we left.  We will not be back.  There is too much good Mexican food in the Phoenix area to ever go back and be treated like this again.  Manuels, Garcia's, Macayo's, Parilla Suisa, the list goes on.  I do not honestly know why anyone eats at Top Shelf anymore."}
{"text":"I ordered the nachos, these come with ground beef. As I was digging in, I noticed a red part in my meat. I put it to the side and looked further.... A lot of the meat appeared uncooked, as there was a lot of red and pink. I asked the waitress to please take my plate, and she said she could replace it for free. I ordered the same thing without meat. When she delivered my plate, not only was there still undercooked meat on it, she told me \"When the meat is reheated in the oven- it can sometimes turn pink & appear uncooked\".... What kind of meat does this?! WOW- so I can be lied to and still get food poisoning? Bullsh*t. You can guarantee I will NOT be returning. I'm sorry I had to pay for my crappy bloody mary & my sick nachos."}
{"text":"There are too many really good Mexican food restaurants in Phoenix area to eat average food here. The service was good and our server was friendly but the restaurant floor was filthy with napkins, chips and food when we arrived and left an hour later. This isn't our first time here but is our last. We won't go back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place that is affordable, clean, and pleasant - with no surprises - this is it. 

The parking lot was full on a Sunday evening, which we took as a good sign. Jon (my bf) and I were greeted by a looks-to-be-13-year-old hostess (not judging, just saying) who asked us if we wanted restaurant, bar, or patio.....we chose bar, which turned out to be a great choice.

The atmosphere was one of a traditional American sports bar. It was comfortable and open. Several tvs were on, and the background radio was country. A friendly blonde waitress had chips/salsa in front of us within 30 seconds of sitting down, and Jon had his High Roller margarita in front of him within 3 minutes.  I ordered the mahi mahi tacos on corn tortillas (which the waitress enthusiastically assured me are \"very popular\") and Jon got the shredded beef chimichanga combo meal.

I guess the perk of sitting in the bar section is that the staff is VERY attentive with the drinks. Our food came out pretty quickly, but not before Jon was able to finish a second High Roller margarita and order an \"SOS - strawberry\" for dessert. He's not even a margarita or \"girly drink\" person, but he said that this place was really impressive.

The food was served fresh on hot plates. I order fish frequently, and I can say that the mahi mahi in my tacos was pure happiness - light, refreshing, and humbling - kind of like when you see the ocean for the first time in years.  My only comment was that I wish there were something that could breathe more spice into the meal. Jon's chimichanga was also tender and flavorful, but it could have used more Mexican charm.

I'm not a connoisseur of Mexican cuisine, and I am the first to admit this. But it's hard to beat the following: good food, moderate price, wonderful service, clean and wholesome atmosphere.

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa are VERY good. 

Steak fajita meat is delicious. 

Pollo fundido is also very good. 

Everything else on the menu is very average. 

Their beans arent very good, and their rice is terrible. 

There are much better mexican restaurants within 15 min of top shelf, but if proximity is a priority, then you go to top shelf. 

Also, there is one waitress there that is awesome. She used to leave phx each summer and come back each winter but i havent seen her recently, but she makes the place 10 times better."}
{"text":"Meh....in a city like Phoenix , where fantastic  Mexican food abounds , these guys really need to up their game. They survive off of happy hour, and the people who live near by. I have eaten here several times, thought it was some what over priced, and mediocre service. The only way I come here, is if I am dragged here by some one else."}
{"text":"The service was awful for lunch. They tended to their regulars but not to less frequent diners. My husband and I came for lunch. The food was good but not worth the 1 hour lack of service. The waitress brought our drinks and food to us quickly but not once did she come back to ask us how our food was or to refill our drinks. We sat there for at least 40 mins without seeing a sign of our waitress or our check. I had an enchilada to put in a to go box... by the time I got the box, (from another waitress) my enchilada was cold, hard, and molded to my plate! Anyways, finally another waitress came over after noting we were looking around, asking if we had paid (to be honest we could have walked out without paying but I'm not that type of person). We told her we hadn't received our check & had been waiting for a very long time. After a while she brought our check and it appeared our original waitress had closed our tab and forgot about us! And the original waitress didn't even come out to our table to apologize! After waiting so long I would at least hope for that. We paid, left no tip (I've only left no tip at a restaurant one time before and we eat out a lot), and left never to go back again. My family has eaten at this restaurant for years (I remember coming with my nana when I was 3-4 years old, so that's over 20 years ago) and I will not be continuing the tradition. At least act like you care about your customers and apologize for your crap service that delayed their day by an hour (and offering a discount or free dessert doesn't hurt). I understand getting slow service sometimes happens, but not the blatant disregard for customer service and lack of providing an amends for your mistake or inconvenience. Due to the hit or miss customer service, I don't recommend coming here. There are comparable Mexican restaurants in the area with much better service and courteous employees."}
{"text":"Ok guys. It smells like dirty mop water throughout the restaurant right now. Can we fix that please?"}
{"text":"Came here to try it out since we moved to Glendale recently and wanted to sit outside. Sat for 45 minutes eating chips, waitresses walked by helping all the tables around us, never acknowled us. So we got up to leave... All the waiteeses said \"have a great night, see you next time\". Never even got a cocktail or anything!"}
{"text":"It always amazes me how a bad restaurant can be so popular.  I have been to this Top Shelf and the one on Greenway unfortunately on several occasions.  Usually it was for drinks with friends before going out.  But I have had many bad items off the menu as well as many bad drinks.

I will keep it short and sweet:  Terrible excuse for Mexican food.  Terrible wait.  Terrible service.  High priced.

There isn't anything positive I have to say about this place other than a lot of people really seem to like it."}
{"text":"Officially done with this place.  Had a cheese enchilada when i looked down after eating there was literally a cup of oil on the plate.  The manager said well that is the cheese we use.  Really?  You use a cheese made with that much oil.  That would equate to cheap cheese.  Two other coouples sitting near us and each of them sent something back."}
{"text":"The location is a bit sketchy - I mean I didn't know there were still kmarts in Phoenix...but aside from that the decor is typical to every cheap chain Mexican place around. The patio where we ate felt a bit like we were in prison, on metal benches with tarps covering the fence walls.

That said - the food, drinks and service were all fantastic - and that's really all that matters!

I get a bit cheesed out at huge restaurants where you can't even place where the restrooms are, but I totally understand that these are family style and meant to accommodate large groups.

I may head back for happy hour, but I won't rush here with out of towners."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere for lunch and dinner.  Glad to see they are now open for breakfast on Sunday for football.  Food is above average for the area, but the service is great. I would recommend eating here and sitting in Mallorys section."}
{"text":"I've created a new award: the \"Wanted\" award for worst of any given thing.  You know, the movie with Angelina where you could fling your wrist while shooting a gun and the bullet would somehow curve in midair?  You remember!  The movie with (once) respectable actors taking information from a giant loom that \"WOVE\" the \"FABRIC\" of time?  Get it?!?!?!?

Well the first Wanted award is in the Restaurants category.  Applause for Top Shelf, the absolute worst restaurant I've ever eaten at.  On the menu, you can choose from nachos that taste like cardboard, tacos stuffed with filling straight from the paper shredder, burritos made out of something a bum would live in, and enchiladas that fill your mouth with the familiar flavor of kleenex.

I hate to be mean.  But since I have a duty to anyone who reads this to disseminate truths, I have to just tell you that you should never go there.  If anyone wants to bring you there you should go all gandhi on them and start a hunger strike.  *trust me*"}
{"text":"I have been going to this top shelf for years.  I work close by so I naturally go to this place and get take out for our office.  They generally have good service.  No one is perfect.  I get the same burrito every time because it is so freakIng god!"}
{"text":"Not bad, I gotta say. Fast service, not very expensive, weak drinks though. Good atmosphere, friendly staff, good food. Standard Mexican food stuff. What really sells the place for me was the patio area. The pond with goldfish was really cool."}
{"text":"With all the great Mexican restaurants in Phoenix, you would think this would be one as well.  I can say this is just average and over priced.  There are much better places in the area."}
{"text":"If you want to go here stick to the drink menu. The margaritas are delicious!! The chips were good but the salsa was a little bland than what I'm use to. What started as a 10 minute wait turned into 40min. We asked for a new high chair as ours was broken and we watched as 4 more families came in with working chairs and we never received ours. The enchiladas left little to be desires. The chicken was perfectly cooked but everything was so bland. I've also never been to a place that uses sour cream and there was about a half a tub on my food. I would def go back for drinks though!!"}
{"text":"I think this is my new fave Mexican food place. I got the naked margarita and it was the best marg I've ever had. The naked one had agave and fresh lime juice. It was delicious. I ordered the low carb chicken dinner. Their chicken is a thin breast grilled. It was actually really good. The veggies were ok. The description said grilled veggies but it was steamed veggies, which I like but I was expecting grill. The other person I went with got a burrito fundito or something. I think it had a cream cheese sauce. I snuck a bite and it was DELICIOUS. If I wasn't on a diet, I would have torn that up. I definitely would be coming back here and y'all should check it out too."}
{"text":"Love this place! The patio is awesome! Usually just come in for some delicious corona light on tap and some of the awesome queso, oh and according to my better half the ranger IPA is also on point.... Side bar... Any way tonight we decided to eat and told the bartender Tiffany to just pick something for us she brought out the fajita fundido on separate plates for us to share it was delicious and Tiffany's great! Sit at the bar for the best service, ask for Tiffany"}
{"text":"This is a very unique restaurant! More authentic Mexican than Tex Mex but with an American sports bar feel. Definitely the vibe Chillis is trying to create but hasn't  quite hit yet. Alex was our server! He was very very friendly knew the menu incredibly well I would highly recommend asking for him! Also! I'm a Margarita snob and theirs were Top Shelf pun intended."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE! Very very rude servers. I ordered my food and was given the wrong thing. I politely told my server it was wrong. And before i could say anything she snatched my plate from me and ran away. Very disrespectful. I'm not an elderly person with entitlement issues. I'm not a millennial with an attitude problem. I'm a regular customer who sees both sides. My friends food was mediocre. Just avoid."}
{"text":"Can't rave about the food, but the standard Mexican choices are tasty.  We had a few beers and appetizers.  Attentive service, plenty of Tvs to catch up on sports scores make is a good choice for before or after an event. I can't imagine sitting there for an entire game."}
{"text":"We've met friends here a couple times now, and while the food isn't bad, the service at the bar is hit or miss. There are a couple things on the menu that Chef Rene makes that are delicious! The Albondigas is wonderful and he makes a cream cheese/green chili dip that is amazing. The food is always hot and comes out quickly, so it's worth a trip here to see if you can find a dish you like. Recommend a visit for sure."}
{"text":"We've been coming to this restaurant for several years now and have always looked forward to our visits. We live in California, and we love Mexican food and when we come to our home in AZ, this restaurant was just a convenient place to go. We absolutely love their chips and salsa, but this time when we went for lunch, we opened the menu and noticed the price increase. We figured no big deal--all restaurants increase prices to keep business running and keep up with their costs. So like always, we ordered the same thing: one red burrito for him and one green burrito for me. When our plates were brought to the table, we were shocked to see how small everything had become. For instance the hard shelled taco used to be filled to the max with meat, veggies, and cheese. It was thin and skimpy. The burrito used to be huge and filled also with lots of meat and sauce and the platter was overflowing with Mexican rice and beans with lots of melting cheese. However, we were so disappointed with not only the presentation, but the quantity. Then when my husband took a bite of his burrito, he said I'm not sure I want to come back to Top Shelf. He said his red burrito did not taste the same as before. I was disappointed as well but not in the taste, but in the quantity. Our server was nice, friendly and professional and provided us with lots of salsa, but it still didn't make up for the food. Normally we can never finish our lunch or dinner there because they give so much food. Today was not the case! My husband finished everything to my surprise! He said there definitely wasn't as much food as before!  We figured if you're going to raise prices which is just the cost of doing business, at least keep the quality and quantity the same.  It saddens me to think that we will not be returning!"}
{"text":"We live close by so we would come here from time to time. This is a nice place and has a cool bar area with karaoke and if you're looking for that it's as good as any. My 1 star is just based on the dine in portion. My go to dish is always the pollo fundido (at any Mexican restaurant) the food here has never been super flavorful but recently the portions have gotten tiny. I'm ok with that as long as the price matched the dish. They raised the price and shrunk the portions. My burrito literally was the size of a 99 cent frozen burrito you get at Fry's. With so many Mexican food places to choose from get your money's worth elsewhere. Nothing's worse than paying good money for a meal and leaving unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Drove into town and had a few hours to spare till I flew out of Phoenix Int' Airport and back to Los Angeles.  My girlfriend decided to bring me here for dinner, as it is local to her and she really likes the food.  My first time experience was very very good!

The customer service was awesome!  The waitress was super attentive, quick, personable, and friendly!  Absolutely no complaints about the service!

The food was very flavorful and nothing tasted frozen.  In  my opion the food can be characterized as Mexican inspired American, but I mean that as a compliment!

In the area and want a place to eat, then this is the place!"}
{"text":"We tried this place a couple years ago and it was gross.  We thought we'd give it another try.  The service was bad.  We walked in and the host said it would be a couple of minutes so we sat down.  Three other sets of people came in after us and were sat right away.  The same host walked over and asked if we had already been helped...so they finally got us a table.  When the waitress came over I asked if they had a kids menu.  She looks at me like I was stupid and she said your holding it.  The kids menu is hiding in the regular menu.  Most restaurants have a separate kids menu that they can color in...we order our food and my husband orders a plain chimi.  He was extremely specific that he wanted plain with only cheese melted on top.  No sauce, no lettuce, just plain.  When she brought his plate it had lettuce, tomatoes, and a huge glob of sour cream.  She goes oh you didn't want sour cream.  She took it back and instead of making it correctly they scraped it off the plate and brought it back.  You could still see where the sour cream touched the burrito..  we will never return here."}
{"text":"Jennifer was our waitress and she was on top of everything and even made sure we didn't run out of drinks! I love this place, the staff and food of COURSE!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place -100 stars, I would.  Awful service, absolutely disgusting food and blatantly racist waitress / barmaid (older blonde woman who was working the night of June 5, 2018, around 9pm).  I have never felt so discriminated in my life.  The whole irony is, you're a Mexican restaurant!  

You really should be ashamed of yourselves."}
{"text":"Tonight we came here for dinner. Myself and my boyfriend orders tacos. The service was ok considering it's Friday and busy. However when the food arrived we began to eat it and the tacos we so greasy to the point that grease soaked through the tortilla. We both need up only eating the beans and rice on plate as the tacos were awful. The cook may want to consider draining the grease before platting the food. Not a good experience and the food was awful. Hopefully they can improve on the cooks in the back. Food is a big part of what brings returning customers."}
{"text":"We sat in the bar. The buss boy was who greeted us and gave us menus along with chips and salsa.  The bartender Jennifer was too busy sitting at the bar talking to a gray haired man to even acknowledge us entering the area.  We ordered a cheese crisp for an appetizer, which came with our meal and was greasy and cold.  We could overhear her conversation with a woman in a coral romper in the bar where Jennifer was complaining about not making tips on a day shift.  Perhaps it's not the shift but her terrible service.  We had to ask for silverware and napkins which I would think would be just basic service and it came after we received our food.  Then to be charged for some cheese for our fajitas was beyond ridiculous.  We have been here several times but will not be returning."}
{"text":"Terrific experience. This was a great lunch experience for me at Top Shelf. I had the Pollo Fundido chicken burrito and it was deeeeelish!

I chose to sit on the patio outside and was the only one there so my service and attentiveness was lack luster, but the food was worth the wait.

I'll remember this place!"}
{"text":"Me and my parents eat here regularly and always sit in Scott's section. His service never disappoints. He remembers what we order and automatically brings out iced teas when we get sat. The food is always tasty and we're always satisfied with Scott's pleasant attitude."}
{"text":"Been here twice and I will never return. 

Service is just ok. Food is horrible. Expensive for what you get. Most Mexican restaurant give you 2 enchiladas for the price of their 1, in a meal. And it tastes awful. 

First time I got chicken fajitas. The chicken was all gross pieces I wouldn't even serve to a dog. And they only give you two wraps. Had to pay extra for a third wrap. 

Second time I got a chicken fajita salad. Came out with rotten brown avocados and shredded dark meat chicken. NOT fajita chicken (grilled breast). 
Fail. Sent it back for a chimi and got beans inside because their meat looks shady. It wasn't great and the lettuce in the plate was brown and rotten. 

Toddler got a cheese crisp. It comes with fries and *only* fries, and don't try to substitute! And you pay $6 for a tiny cheese crisp (they're free at cafe rio, btw...). Asked for sour cream in place of fries. Nope, extra $1.00. So now we are up to $7.00 for a cheap and terrible kids meal. Fail. 

Chips and salsa were decent. That's about it."}
{"text":"We had a few problems with this place that just made it a \"no I would never go back or recommend it\" type of situation. We sat in the booth area of the bar so we could watch the game. Ordered beer and sodas and the beer took ten or more minutes to come out. The waitress asked if he wanted a water while waiting for the beer, he said yes. Five minutes later he got the beer but never any water. We ordered the mini chimi platter and asked for half chicken and half beef. Two plates were brought for a total of 16. We called the waitress over since the manager ( the manager tried to give it to the table in front of us) had brought it out to make sure this was only one order.  She said yes so we canceled the entrée we ordered, we didn't expect such a big appetizer. The mini chimis were average at best.  We order guacamole and never got it. We were going to order desert but the waitress dropped the check saying how she fixed the mistake with the second chimi plate. We were confused at first since we didn't know there was a mistake since we asked about the appetizers before we started. Guess it was a mistake and our order was wrong on top of it since one plate was beef and one was chicken. We never got the the guacamole and was charged too. 

Honestly, I was just annoyed the service was bad and slow. They obviously didn't know what was going on. Since we tried to make sure they didn't make a mistake before eating, I don't feel great full they didn't charge us for it as the waitress tried to make it as a favor. But I guess in a place that can't get people what they ordered and understand when a mistake is made when it is point blank pointed out. 

There was rips in cushions and over all the place wasn't well maintained. For a place that is called top shelf it prices were the only thing that matched."}
{"text":"burrito was a little thicker than normal but still had s great taste.  The atmosphere is great and the service was good.  I'll come back."}
{"text":"The interior Decor is nice, they have a patio and a nice looking bar area with lots of TVs. The dining area is nice and the service was prompt. So prompt in fact that the busboy was cleaning off our table and wiping it down before I had even signed our check. (We were only 1 of 4 couples in the dining area, not sure what the rush was.)
As the old adage goes you could always tell a good Mexican restaurant by their chips and salsa. The chips here were pretty good, their salsa was only a little better than the pace bottled stuff from the store. The cheese crisp was Okay, but it was unlike any cheese crisp I've ever had. It was served on a dinner plate and it was only as big as the dinner plate. My chicken chimichanga was extremely boring and lackluster. The chicken tasted like it was canned. My husband's beef tacos weren't really any better. I would say this place looks like a good little dive to go into for football and hit up the bar, it looks like they have some takeout going on as well. This isn't great, I've had worse, I had a hole where the hungry's were in my stomach and this managed to shut them up. 
We probably will not return. They need to up their food game a whole lot."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner tonight with a friend. I had the appetizer plate and an ice water with lemon. The water tastes terrible so I had to ask for an iced tea. The food was so bland that I had to add a ton of salt. Even with sour cream and guacamole, it was bland. That wasn't the worst part.........about 20 minutes after we got home, I threw up everything. My stomach just turned. I had Staph Food Poisoning last year from another restaurant so I knew right away what was happening. I won't be eating there again or out for that matter anymore. Wish I would have read the reviews before going. I can't believe they continue to make people sick and all of the bad reviews. I will be contacting the Health Dept."}
{"text":"So I decided to give them another chance because I like Mexican food,  they have the baseball package and they are close.  Service has been better the last couple of times. The food is avg but the smell is still at the bar. I wish a manager would do something about that. If they would fix that, I would give them 3 stars."}
{"text":"Food was okay not exciting but just your average Mexican food.. Salsa was flat.. needed some kick! Service was good and people were friendly. Atmosphere was nice but right at pit table the mini blinds were broke and a napkin was stuffed to replace the broken slats. It wasn't great but not bad .. just average."}
{"text":"Great service less then mediocre food.
We went for lunch and the parking lot being empty should have been a sign. 
I had the fish tacos that were very fishy and came on flour tortillas and with lettuce when the menu stated corn tortillas and cabbage. rice and beans were fine nothing special. 
My boyfriend ordered the shrimp fajitas and he tasted one shrimp and said I cant eat this, ill get sick. The shrimp tasted old and were almost soggy.    
DO NOT recommend and will not be back."}
{"text":"Top Shelf has decent mexican food but they are a bit more expensive and don't offer the same value as say Garcia's.  I have been there at least 3-5 times over the years and I have always left happy but I am about not having to spend too much money if I don't have to especially If I can get the same food and service ( Garcia's ) for a little cheaper.

If you live in the area give Top Shelf a try.  They have good food and service.  They are just not my favorite."}
{"text":"This was the worst service I have ever had anywhere.  My family should have just walked out it took over 1 hr to get our food out ( a family of 5) we  complained to manager and she said I'm sorry I only have two cooks tonight.  When the food came one meal was not even there.  one meal  was the wrong meal.  The third meal was messed up.    But to be nice the gave us 10% off that was a whole $4.86 off  what a joke. I will be never eating there again.  We spent over 50 dollars.  The only good part was the waiter was very nice and you could tell he felt really bad."}
{"text":"We moved to Peoria last year and were looking for a good Mexican sit down restaurant.  We have tried this place 3 times so far, and I am underwhelmed. I transferred to San Diego for two years for work, and there is no shortage of good Mexican food there, so I wanted to give this place a chance by making multiple visits.  On previous visits I considered their food ok.  Not bad but not super good and the service was acceptable.

On our last visit about 2 weeks ago, we went in for a late dinner on a Monday night.  We decided to sit on the patio  After waiting for about 7 minutes (from when I started timing), we still were not greeted.  There were two seats open at the bar, so we moved inside.  It took the bartender a bit to greet us, but eventually we ordered some wine and the fajitas.  We also asked for some pico de gallo for our chips at the same time.  I thought the food took a little long to get there, but a horrible wait.  The bartender disappeared for quite a while, and when we next saw her she was bringing us our food.  Still no pico de gallo, and when I asked her expression made it clear that she had forgotten. 

The topper was that the fajitas were not good.  The chicken was dry and flavorful, and the veggies were soggy. Honestly, I've had much better fajitas at Chili's.  It's sad because this place is literally around the corner from our house,  however when you couple this experience with the fact their wine select consists of \"house\" wines, I don't think I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. The health-conscience \"lite\" menu is freaking awesome. Everything is reasonably priced and the bar is great for watching sports. Outside area is cool, too. Don't listen to other reviewers. Drop what you're doing and eat here. Show up a bit early if you want to get a good TV-viewing spot in the bar. While it is plenty big, it is also popular--so it fills up about 15-30 minutes before game time."}
{"text":"I just finished dinner here and when I had ordered a drink during dinner, rather than checking my ID at the table, the waitress penny snatched my military ID and completely walked away from the table into the kitchen where I had no idea what she was doing with my ID, when she returned I had to ask to get my ID back and she told us that she couldn't see in the dark of the dining room, however when we spoke to the manager later he told us that she had never seen a military ID and wanted to ask someone else to check it, so one of them is lying and our waitress needs to learn boundaries or be fired. I will not be back ever after having my ID taken away like that."}
{"text":"Go there every week, for the last couple months. Service just gets worst and worst. We sat down with my boyfriends parents, who arrived before us. And it took the waitress 30 minutes to even realize we were there and order our drinks. When she arrived, you could just tell she hated her job and didn't want to be there. An hour goes by and finally our food came out, while all of us have been done with our drinks for quite some time now. I'm sorry but this restaurant goes down hill every single time we go there. By now we haven't even gone in for 2-3 weeks now. They need more HAPPY servers and another cook or something."}
{"text":"Great food, fast and attentive service with large portions and quality ingredients.  We ordered a tostada, spinach enchiladas, and a burrito.  All of our dishes were really good - served hot, tasty and not over or under seasoned and our waitress was very friendly.  Try the Margaritas!"}
{"text":"Three stars because apparently quantity has a quality all its own.

Huge portions, great service, cool atmosphere and OK food. Not saying it isnt worth the trip but probably best on a Sunday or Monday night when football is on."}
{"text":"I have lived right by this location for a few years now and haven't been into this Top Shelf location till recently....I wish I would have stayed away!  The only reason I went was because my normal, delicious Mexican food spot was closed and I really wanted a margarita and some tacos and a tostada.  I went in to the bar and got some food to go while I had a margarita.  The margarita and the chips and salsa were good and the bartender was decently friendly...so far so good!  I went with a taco and burrito combo and added a tostada.  When I got the to-go order I checked everything to make sure everything was in there, I noticed everything was wrapped up in aluminum foil, the only thing in to-go boxes were the beans and rice lol!  My burrito, taco and tostada were all wrapped in aluminum foil and not actually in a to-go box...no big deal...I guess.  When I ate the food it was very bland, hardly any cheese on my tostada and taco.  The green chile burrito was ok, the tortilla was embarrassing for a Mexican place, it was clearly past its throw out date and was flaking off and crusty.  Not worth the 30$ I spent...would have preferred Taco Bell....I would have saved a lot of money too!"}
{"text":"I got the Carne Asada taco dinner. Pretty good. Was still kind of hungry though. The house margarita was below average. Service was good. I'd go back to drink, but thought the food was pricey for the amount you get."}
{"text":"This is my husband and my \"we don't know where to do so let's go there\" place.  We always get a pitcher of the ultimate margaritas, proudly polish off a couple baskets of chips, and consistently have a fun time.  My favorite place to sit is in the booths in the bar, but those seats fill up quickly.  The patio is also a great spot if it's not too hot outside, but the restaurant section is the place to go if you're looking for somewhere more quiet.  The spinach enchiladas are tasty and my husband usually gets the burrito fundito.   The food is average, but the margaritas and service are good.  It can get pretty crowded so we try to get there early.  The restaurant  and patio sections are good for big groups, but you may need a reservation (if possible) for groups larger than 5 or 6.  

They always have coupons on their site and there are many TVs throughout the bar and patio.  It's a very casual vibe and good for an unassuming night with your significant other or buddy."}
{"text":"So I went here...and ya know...it looks like a typical chain midwestern wanna be legit mexican place...but if you can embrace the kitchiness of the decor and the fact that all these indie restaurants in cenpho really want that honky tonk mix to take away from their pretentious regular 'im a starving-emo-distraught-artist that can afford to drop ten bucks on a bowl of oatmeal' crowd...this place just naturally has it...

and the food wasn't quite authentic...but it was pretty good nonetheless...and i was in the mood for white wine (thankfully im not picky) but they skip the classy i'm only filling your glass 1/3 of the way deal...they give you the college pour...and i like it that way

so if you're in the neighborhood and avoiding other chainy options...this is at least middle of the road..."}
{"text":"I called the manager to let him know that I was given the wrong item on take out and over charged an entire meal. I ordered something ala carte, and was given a meal instead. His response to me was 'next time be more specific'. I was a frequent customer of this restaurant, but no longer, will be taking my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Coming here based on history, I knew we were in for a mediocre meal. But hey, some chips and salsa and a beer never hurts. Took fifteen minutes before a server stopped over to get out drinks. Mind you it was completely dead. $15 for a taco plate? Are you serious? The food is insanely over priced and worse than mediocre. This place really needs to step it up or they will be out of business with these prices."}
{"text":"Ok so we came here for a few drinks after dinner.  We arrived about 8:00 and we were able to find a table near the bar.  Now I did not have any food as I am a strict beer diet.  I did however have a nice 32 oz Tecate.  My friends had some margaritas and they enjoyed them.   

The bar was very loud but they did have a lot of t.vs and all the March Madness games were on.
The server appeared to be new but did a good job.  
Not a bad place to check out if you are town for a few days."}
{"text":"I ordered take-out last night and was very underwhelmed. I am by no means a picky eater and I've never written a negative restaurant review before. My food looked as if it was left-overs from yesterday that were simply reheated. I picked my order up as soon as it was available so I know that it was not my own fault that the food seemed old. I ate just a few bites of my enchilada before pushing it aside and scouring my own kitchen pantry for something to whip up myself. After consulting with a few family members, it became clear that I am not the only one who is surprised this restaurant has stayed in business so many years. There are much better Mexican food options out there!!!"}
{"text":"Got an email from Kim apologizing for the drinks and inviting us to come back and let her find our \"perfect\" margarita.  Very good action on her part.  We haven't been back yet, but we will, very soon."}
{"text":"Came here as part of a group of about 20 girls for a ladies' karaoke night...what a blast!!  My friend had reserved space well in advance, so we had a long table, right in the center of all the karaoke action, with plenty of space to dine and visit.  I didn't eat, but the entire restaurant smelled delicious.  My first drink - a Long Island Iced Tea - was pretty good, not the strongest I've ever had, but tasty enough.  It did seem like I had to flag someone down every time I wanted to order a drink or close out my tab, but it was a busy Saturday night, so that's understandable.  The servers were all fun and friendly.  When karaoke started up around 9pm, that's when the real fun began!  Loved the host, he was great.  Loved the set up, how singers could take the microphone and sing wherever in the room they were comfortable...near their own table or group of friends, or whatever.  And plenty of floor space for the real \"performers\" to move around...or recruit the ladies (who may or may not have had a few drinks by then, ehem) to get up and dance.  We all had such a great time.  I'd never been to a karaoke venue that was an actual restaurant, so this was a different experience for me, and I will certainly make it happen again!!  Fun!!"}
{"text":"I go back and forth with whether I like this place or not. The food is sometimes bland and sometimes ok. The only time it wow-ed me was when it had just opened a few years ago. Over the past year or so, the flavor isn't really there. I'd have to say I normally eat at this place for convienence. Their chips and salsa is good, service is ok, and the food varies."}
{"text":"Meh, we weren't that impressed with our latest visit to Top Shelf. It's decent enough, but they don't have anything in particular that will keep me coming back for more or craving anything in particular from the place.

The side of guac we got was also kinda crappy. Seemed like it was old or had some other prob. Maybe they made it in the morning and it didn't hold that well till the time we ate dinner there.

On the positive side, no lard is injected or slathered on their refried beans, so the plethora of dishes that include beans are safe for vegetarian consumption."}
{"text":"WORST service EVER!!!  We waited a good 15 minutes to even get a waitress to come to our table. Another 15 to get any drinks or chips/salsa. After ordering, it took 45 min to get our food. Our waitress NEVER came back to check on us, refill our drinks or advise why our food was taking so long.  Upon delivery of our food, there was never an apology. When we confronted our waitress with this concern, she had zero remorse or explanation for the delay.  In addition, the restaurant refuses to honor the coupon, the restaurant itself issues, because it was not printed out. Who prints coupons anymore?! It's called smart phones. We were told a manager would speak with us upon our exit, but was no where to be found when we left.  We will NOT be back and will continue to spread the word on how dissatisfied and terrible this restaurant truly is."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Food is good. I like the happy hour food and drinks. It's a shame they allow smoking outside, ruins the experience for those who don't smoke.  I think I'd visit and enjoy outside bar more if it was smoke free. Probably rate it higher also. Never sat in restaurant, always in bar inside or out. Staff is nice.  Often get food to go. Always good and hot."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and had the hamburger chimichanga.  The first bite tasted a little weird but i ate it anyways :) It was the only thing I had eaten all day.  I came down with food poisening the next morning.  I thought the manager would want to know but instead of offering good customer service she insinuated that it was not their food. No appology and very rude.  Bad food...bad customer service."}
{"text":"Our weds night dinner stop after evening bootcamp. Love the chips and salsa. And AWESOME fish tacos. But sometimes the services is a little behind"}
{"text":"Being an Arizona native, well Phoenix metro more specifically, I grew up in the west valley. Back then it was an entirely different landscape, there was no Loop 101, no Arrowhead Towne Center and no Walgreen's on every corner. Back then there were farms of cotton and orange groves as far as your eye could see. During the springtime the intoxicating smell of orange blossoms filled the air with their sweet fragrance, it was amazing. Today almost all of the orange trees have been paved over to make way for so called progress and what was is now a distant memory. 

While the west valley appears to be pretty much like any other part of the valley or the nation for that matter, landscaped by corporate America, there are a few places my family frequented that have managed to survive. One place in particular brings back some of my earliest experiences with Mexican food, Top Shelf. For over 30 years Top Shelf has been making simple yet delicious Mexican food in the west valley. I'm not talking about anything fancy, just tasty burritos, enchiladas and large plates filled with red and green chile, all hearty, comforting and oh-so satisfying. 

Naturally, once sat, you're treated to a large bowl of fresh chunky mild salsa and hot salty chips. This is something that many newer Mexican joints just don't do, a sign of the times I guess? What usually goes great with your chips and salsa? An Original Top Shelf Margarita (6.75), though their version had a bit too much margarita mix which made it acidic.  After only a few sips it didn't matter that much. 

Any Mexican place I visit I always will order a Cheese Crisp ($5.55) with lettuce and tomatoes. Ever since I can remember eating here The Top Shelf version has always had the perfect balance of crunchy tortilla to gooey cheese ratio. The addition of fresh veggies and a few spoonfuls of salsa make for a healthful and delicious appetizer, well in my mind anyway. 

Quite a few places around town serve up a Fajita Burrito Fundido ($14.95), though only a few get it right. In the Top Shelf version they take grilled chicken or beef, wrap it in a huge flour tortilla then deep fry until it's brown and crispy. On top they then cover it with jalapeno cream cheese and melted cheddar cheese and it's served with beans & rice. While I only had a few bites in order to save room for other items, the tender chicken was so moist and flavorful they didn't even have to put cheese on it.

Years ago it was at Top Shelf that I had my first exposure to red chile; they take cubes of lean pork then simmer them in a bath of red chile gravy. With the Number 8 Combo, ($13.20), you not only get a massive plate with a red chile burrito, you also get a cheese enchilada, beef taco plus rice and beans. Whew, it took me some time to finish but I felt proud of myself for accomplishing this. 

While the smell of orange blossoms is gone, the taste of Mexican food remains, free chips and all."}
{"text":"I thought Top Shelf was good! As good as Macayo's or Valle Luna.  Had the grilled fish tacos. Fish was good but was served as a typical taco with flour tortilla, tomato, lettuce and cheese. That was kind of a disappointment. Others in the party enjoyed their food and I really liked the rice and beans! Service was great!"}
{"text":"Excellent food service this is the best place fort Mexican food been going here for decades nothing compares. 
35th and Greenway is a lot better then 83rd and deer valley"}
{"text":"Excellent food service this is the best place for Mexican food been going here for decades nothing compares."}
{"text":"If the personalities of the place could be excused this place would get more stars but the undeniable fact is the arrogance of the staff makes it impossible to enjoy this restaurant. The food is great no doubts there but if you aren't ordering it for take out you might as well go to Del Taco down a little bit for all the trouble it is to eat there. They do have NFL Sunday Ticket for football but they only have 8 TVs there and they arranged so that for some you have to sit in a booth. Half your party won't be able to see the game you came there to see. You're better off going to an actual sports bar than to see the Giants playing the Panthers at this poorly arranged and attended joke of a restaurant."}
{"text":"This place had great tasting food and it a lot of fun! I came here last Saturday night during the ASU vs. UofA game. The place was packed! For how busy it was it was still exciting to be here  without annoyance of a large crowd. 

Parking was a little bit of an issue when I got there. I had to park by the Tutor Time and walk over to the restaurant. Other then that this place in a great location on the north west corner of 83rd ave and deer valley rd.

Once you walking to bar area is straight ahead. I noticed with the college football game on this area was very crowed with people watching the game. Clearly you can see the bar area here is a lot of fun. There are TVs every where, and the bar staff seem high energy and friendly. Now I know if I plan on watching a sporting event here, I would need to show up somewhat early. 

Once I got sat in the restaurant area, I was displeased there were no TVs anywhere. It was a little frustrating that I could here the crowd from the car area cheer to the game, and I was missing it. 

I asked the waitress if they were able to make a drink called a Corona-Rita, which is a margarita with a corona beer inserted upside down into the beverage. The waitress mentioned it wasn't on the menu, however they make them all the time. When she delivered the drink it looked awesome! It was prepared in a huge stein glass beer mug and tasted great! I definitely recommend getting one if you ever visit this place. 

My food tasted good! I ordered the chicken enchilada meal. Its consists of two enchiladas with red sauce, Mexican rice, and beans. It was a lot of food, and was able to fill me up. The chips and salsa here were not to bad either. It seemed the waitress had a difficult time keeping our chip bowl full, for the simple reason they were that good. 

I will be back here again to enjoy the food and have another corona-rita!"}
{"text":"Terrible quality food.  Will never go back.  Taco salad had water at the bottom making the shell mushy.  Husband agreed that his meal was of low quality as well."}
{"text":"Decent food, we had very good service. I'd definitely come here again."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food good but the place is in desperate need of a cleaning. The booth we were seated in had old food splattered on the wall and a hole in the drywall where the table was mounted."}
{"text":"Are you sure this is a chain?

The staff is awesome the food is great. The prices are reasonable. 

Sounds like a mom n pop type place to me. 

I still am a fan of the Pollo Fundito... wife tried the shredded beef one and it was good but not as good as the chicken."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I Traveled from San Bernardino Ca to Phoenix AZ. once arriving from a 5 hour dr we wanted to just relax and eat some good Mexican food, we decided to try out Top Shelf. Unfortunately our experience was far from great. Our waiter Robert came to take our order, my boyfriend ordered a beer and showed his CA ID. Robert said that his ID wasn't valid and went to \"ask\" the manager if he could accept it. He came back and said that they wouldn't be able to serve him his beer. He has a valid ID from CA so we don't understand what was the issue. We honestly felt discriminated, how is it possible that as a waiter your whole attitude changes after seeing the customers name. It is a complete shame to say that this place made our first impression of Arizona a not so great one. Definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Only 1 stared it so I could write this review"}
{"text":"Not sure why they don't have at least a 4 star rating. They have some of the best Mexican food around. I personally give them 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Zero stars. Do not stop there, do not order. Do not waste your time or money. Filthy dirty carpet  (what is the kitchen like?) The food is disgusting.  Red hot plates....ice cold enchiladas...no flavor. Disgusting place.  There is SO much good Mexican food in this area.....BUT NOT HERE!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food. I order the carne asada burro dinner. The only reason I rated a 4 star was because the food was great, our waitress was great as well, but the person that greeted us really did not seem like they wanted to be there and it did kind of put a toll on the mood. 

However, I love how they bring you chips while you wait for your food and we also tried the deep fried ice cream and boy was it delicious! :)"}
{"text":"Found not one but TWO long brown hairs in my food. One at the beginning of my meal and one at the end. What a great way to enjoy a meal. The waiter didn't really say much to me about it and comped my meal. Apparently he mentioned it to the kitchen staff. Just gross. Food is consistently underwhelming. Never going back. Nasty"}
{"text":"I started coming to this Top Shelf location after finding hair in my food on a few occasions at the other location. A few days ago We came to eat here for our anniversary, then subsequently spent the next 36 hours in agony with excruciating stomach pain, and other unmentionable symptoms. So yeah, totally eat here if you like food poisoning from over priced, shit food. Literally. Shit food. It's such a shame. I'll never eat at any Top Shelf locations again. It's been almost 4 days and I'm still in pain. Never ever eat here."}
{"text":"The food is simply horrible. It lacks flavor, probably due to the lack of it being fresh and seasoned properly. If you want a fried item then it is the same as any other fried food at any other place. The service is ok, nothing special. It is always busy whenever we drive by and it is a mystery. If you want fresh, perfectly seasoned and cooked food I would suggest chipotle."}
{"text":"Food is good. Nice flavor to the meat. Understaffed. You wait a long time if you need anything. Probably the worst in town."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill, use to be my go to place for some good Mexican food. Haven't been in a while, so I decided to go today and wish I chose different waitress was great food was terrible/horrible next time I'll search for a food truck before I step one foot in this place again. Wish I can give it 0 stars but the waitress is the reason Top Shelf got 1 star from me. Hashtag GROSS"}
{"text":"Was with group of my girlfriends on Sunday afternoon and they had mention going to Top Shelf for Sunday lunch, I had never been and thought ok cool lets go, I love trying new places out!

When we walked in there was no hostess to greet us, we were standing around for about 8 minutes, then someone walked out with a to go order for another customer, I thought well ok she was busy with that order, but maybe someone should have let us know that someone was coming to take care of us and not just ignoring us.

Got to our table, our waitress was Cindy, oh what a snarky lady she was.  

Chips and salsa were brought to the table, being my 1st time their I didn't know you had to ask for the hot stuff, the salsa brought to the table tasted like Pace Picante sauce to me, just flavored tomato sauce, but that's because I like heat baby! So when I found out about the hot stuff, oh yea I was in heaven! It had great flavor and heat.  
We placed our order, I ordered the lunch special, the El Pollo Grande, chicken burrito with green sauce, beans, and added rice to it  and came with sour cream.  It was taking a while for the food to come out and we didn't mind, but our chips did get eaten and we asked for a refill and our lovey waitress told us Ladies, don't forget your food is still coming in a condescending tone, we were kinda shocked and didn't know how to respond that, we just said well bring on the chip and more salsa please.
The burrito was perfect, it was a great blend of green chili and chicken, Food was good, service was snarky, if in the area might come back and give it another try."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times as we live very close.  I have had a few different dishes here, the fajitas, the number 2 combo which is a taco, a enchilada and a tostada and I have also have had the taco combo.  We go here more for convienince than for the quality of the food. The service is usually good but the food is very bland even the salsa is bland to me. There are other better choices but they are further away.  Not what I would call top shelf."}
{"text":"Purchased a chicken taco salad to go. It was ready within 10 minutes. It came with chips and salsa! The hostess was very helpful. When she noticed I did not want dressing for the salad she included a second cup of salsa. Portions are large for the price. I gave only three stars because the shell was pre made, the chicken was salty and the salad mix had carrots and red cabbage in it (who does that?). I have eaten at this location before and probably will again. It was not fabulous, just ok."}
{"text":"We recieved brown Guacamole and we were told by our waiter that the chef said that it was made that day and bown was the right color for guacamole, we will not return!!!"}
{"text":"This is a good neighborhood bar for am after written cocktail. Everyone is a regular, and the company is always pleasant. The margaritas aren't bad, and the food is middle of the road. I go here to unwind in a bar where I know there won't be any shenanigans or unruly crowds."}
{"text":"If you don't mind the bad attitudes of the staff the beer is cold!

Unfortunately this place has not gotten any better in the last few years.  They use to be the place to get good Mexican food, Margarita's and a cold Tecate from hosts that cared about your dining experience.  Not so much now.

In general the staff, including the manager(s) have no concept of nor a desire to provide a dining experience conducive to the culture the menu reflects.

There is so much potential for this restaurant if the mindset of the staff can be changed or replaced.  Maybe Discovery Channels will do a show on this place and help the owners turn it around.  

That's of course if they care.  Good restaurants monitor what the public has to say and responds. N o evidnece of that here."}
{"text":"What are the best Mexican food restaurants in town. they have two locations. I've been going to this restaurant for over 30 years. It's  very authentic. If you like it hot ask for the extra hot sauce. And if you like it crispy ask for extra crispy. They accommodate anyway you like.  great service and a great sports bar as well . If you want to watch a certain sport just ask they'll tune in one of their Many TVs on what you want to watch . They have an outside patio and the place is always jumping.  This is where the locals go and beyond because it's so good they will come from a far. Once you try this restaurant I'm sure you'll be  back. Did I mention the beer is nice and cold and frothy mugs to boot!"}
{"text":"this is a consistently good mexican restaurant, but definitely not my favorite. my husband loves it so being the good wife that i am i give in once in awhile and let him have his yummy. i think the prices are a bit steep for standard mexican fare - especially when i consider top shelf compared to my new obsession, el encanto dos. the portions aren't too small or too outrageously large. i'm not a huge fan of either fundido option - the $11ish one or the $14-is one ... althought the $14 one has higher quality beef or chicken. there are far better fundidos in the valley. his tacos with a side of rice are always good, and he eats every bite. i recently enjoyed sour cream enchiladas (1 beef, 1 chicken) and they, along with the rice and beans were a solid dish. service is always good but our most recent experience (monday night) featured top notch service. our server was attentive without being annoying, funny without being fake, efficient without making us feel rushed. we loved him! this 3 star restaurant gets an additional star for service."}
{"text":"Came here last night with a large party and we had Bethany as our server and with separate tabs. This pleasant, young lady was on her game! She got every single order right, we never had to ask for refills and she was so sweet and smiled the entire night!!  I sure home management reads this because you have a GEM of a server on your hands!!!
Much appreciated Miss Bethany!!!! 
Food was just as great, first time I have ever eaten here and chips and salsa were aplenty and food was served hot and fresh and delish!!

Thank you for a great Experience!! 
Kristina"}
{"text":"Service was very good and I would go back for the lounge area.  However I think the prices are a little high.  I appreciated the lite menu with calories listed and ordered off of that.  My lite dinner came with some delicious chilled sliced cantaloupe for the fruit side, but the salad was not very green.  The salad had big white hunks of iceberg lettuce that I did not care to eat.  My boyfriend got the chicken fundito and it was good.   I would come back to try again because the salsas and service were very good, and maybe the salad side with the lite menu choices will get better."}
{"text":"I have been going here for 20 years.    It just keeps getting worse.    Today the food took way too long, a burrito was in a corn tortilla!   Burritos are always supposed to be flour.   A $14 Carne asada burrito was so small.  AND on top of that they charged me extra for guacamole, I asked for it on the side instead of inside.        Unfortunately I think it's time we find a new place.    And as they get worse, they raise prices."}
{"text":"We walked in and were taken to our table. The place was filthy. Un bused empty tables, carpet that looked as it hadn't been vacuumed in days. The place was simply disgusting. We left without even sitting down. Wish negative stars were available as a choice..."}
{"text":"Me an my date both got fajitas. He got fajita quesadilla and I got fajitas and the waitress said beef was good and they were. But as far as helpful and kindness that all she did was say the beef fajitas were good. Her service sucked. She was hanging out with her friend and when we asked for a box she didn't even bring us a bag. She disappeared. It was a Sunday afternoon I get it's not busy so maybe she forgot idk but the service wasn't nice. Food is bomb.com."}
{"text":"Decided to try again since it's been a little over two years. Everyone in our group agreed the food is so mediocre and tasteless. Cheese seems processed, shrimp are bland and tiny. $16 for a tostada with tiny little shrimp? My friends burrito had very little meat. No FLAVOR! Maybe the snowbirds like bland Mexican food for high prices. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Walked in at about 7:30, were seated immediately... But walked out at 7:43 after the group behind us who had just been sat down was being waited on, when had not been acknowledged in the least. No drink order, no \"I'll be right with you\", nothing.  

This was after walking into the ladies room, and noticing what I believe was a homeless woman in the small restroom with her clothing spread across the baby changing table, taking care of her hygiene needs."}
{"text":"This was a horrible experience. Top shelf is unaccommodating to anyone with dietary needs/ allergies. I looked online and couldn't find a gluten free menu for this place. So I called and asked the lady on the phone for gluten free options. She recommended the number three (2 tacos and 1 enchilada). When I got to the restaurant to pick up the food, I asked the other lady at the counter to verify with the chefs if the dish was gluten free. She told me that nothing at top shelf is gluten free, except maybe the fajita meat. I told her that the lady on the phone said it was and the other girl at the counter (who I spoke too) claimed she never heard me mention gluten free on the phone. I asked her if she would talk with the chefs to see if they could specialty make me something and she didn't. She got the manager and all he did was take the plate off the bill, didn't even talk to me to try to accommodate me and prepare me something new. I will never go back to this place again. I would give this place zero stars if I could. Take my advice: don't waste your time."}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent this place quite a bit. We enjoy it, we know what we are getting into when we go here, good prices for good portions of good food. 

Nothing lights out, but filling and, for the most part, authentic. 

The location is a little weak, you have to really want to go to Top Shelf to go to Top Shelf, as it is tucked just deeply enough into the NW Peoria Suburbs that its almost not worth it. 

I really enjoy the chicken burrito fundido. I'm just saying."}
{"text":"I love the Pollo Fundido...I can't seem to order anything else. I loce the jalapeño cream cheese they put on top. The chips are very average and the salsa is pretty bland  (salt helps)but not worth the extra calories. Portions are large enough my husband and I share a meal. I don't like the fact that children are allowed to sit in the bar area. As an adult with grown children I go to the bar area to have an adult meal, not have it disrupted with unruly kids."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Terrible service and I can usually tell how my food is going to be by the chips and salsa. Chips were stale, salsa below average and we had to ask for them. Waitress was more in the mood to socialize with drunkies in the bar instead of taking care of her customers who were there to eat. Food was bland and tasteless. They should change their name to \"Clearance Shelf.\""}
{"text":"Waitress tried to rip us off. Bill was $81 and half our party paid $40! Waitress tried to hand me a $61 dollar receipt. Glad my son who is a server caught it. Unbelievable I won't be back after that trick!"}
{"text":"I was worried about the 3 star rating, but I'm very glad to have come here. I ordered the El Pollo Grande which was a big portion with classic shredded chicken and green chillies. You can tell it's all made to order. Lunch special price was $10. Comes with the nice thin chips and salsa. Ask for some hot salsa as well! I'll be back for sure :)"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying our server was great and very attentive. However, the food does not meet the quality expectations of what it cost. The cheese con queso seemed just like regular melted cheese that cost $6, we didn't care for the taste. And the chimichanga we ordered cost $12, it was barely warm so we took a bite and decided to forgo eating the rest. Honestly, if I am going to spend a lot of money in dining out I want the food to taste good and be enjoyable, and sadly this just wasn't the case for this establishment."}
{"text":"The food and drinks were solid. I can't complain there. If it wasn't for the food being good, this would be one star review for sure! The setup of the restaurant worked as well. Smoking on the patio was a negative and drove my wife and I to ignore that section of the restaurant. Beautiful patio area too, so it's a shame they allow smoking out there.

My major complaints are with the service and the cleanliness of the restaurant. There was trash all over the floors by the trash cans because they were full and overflowing. I watched the manger go up three times and just try to push the trash down further rather than doing the right thing and just taking the trash out. There was employee drinks all over the bar area. The server station had salsa and chips all over it. 

The manager was more concerned with watching the final four than making sure the restaurant was clean. I called him over to find out if there was an email for corporate or the owners and he let me know my only option was to contact the general manager. The general manager, I guess her name is Kim, only works Monday to friday at lunch... no wonder this restaurant is in need of help. The person who runs the ship isn't even there during their busiest times.  

The most off putting thing happened right before we left. I saw our server pull a basket of chips from a table, dump the chips and fill the same basket and paper with new chips and then serve it to another table!!! Absolutely disgusting. 

Our server was the worst. She came to our table three times before even introducing herself. Picked up her last check one time, grabbed an old beer off our table the next and then threw menus at us the third. After about ten minutes of us just sitting there she actually decided to come introduce herself as our server. Very odd. Maybe she was just having a bad night. 

Due to the fact that we like the food, we might consider checking out the other location. 

If I owned this restaurant, I would be very concerned over the way my restaurant was being ran."}
{"text":"Top Shelf's chips and salsa are decent, but not as good as Manuels (IMHO). They do have a really good happy hour. You can get a 32 oz for 3 dollars and some change, which is a pretty darn good deal. We used to randomly come here for their karaoke nights, which was always entertaining. 

I have had their enchiladas, tacos, burritos and everything has been fairly typical tasting, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Haven't  eaten the food here but came for the hot salsa, got 3 pints to go...it's da bomb !"}
{"text":"I've lived rather close to Top Shelf for about 20 years - never ate there...until now.   Wow, the green chili chimichanga is hands-down THE BEST I have had ever!   I thought it was a fluke so to make sure I ate there 3 more times (take out as well) and yep, the Chimi is the best.  Shredded beef tacos are excellent as well.  

Dated decor but it's all about the flavor - and Top Shelf delivers.  

I'm terribly stingy with my 5 stars but hey, Top Shelf deserves a SOLID 4!"}
{"text":"Order anything with the jalapeno cream cheese! The salsa is amazing too! The ambiance is a bit dated but the food totally makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is good the staff in the cantina is consistent on being courteous and timely with getting the order out. The grand tostada is amazing, however do not order it to go, it becomes soggy. Great place to hang out with family and friends."}
{"text":"We give it 3 1/2 stars.  Decent happy hour in the cantina that is kid friendly, which can be hard to find.  Brian was our server and he was excellent.  Average sonoran food that can border on a bit Taco Bell'ish.    If it was 3 AM and I was writing this I'd rate it higher.  We'll come back for their margs (bomb) and their karaoke which we heard is hella fun."}
{"text":"Short story: Very \"Americanized\" Mexican food at higher than necessary prices. Watery so so salsa, but the chips were fresh and good. We made the mistake of parking on the side by the dumpsters: Avoid that mistake, they smell terrible! And is it just me but when the employees use the general bathroom in the front of the restaurant is that kind of weird? Going in to use the bathroom I was passed by a cook on the way in and waiter on the way out. Maybe it's just me. For the food: The fish taco is not recommended, fishy and bland. The beef taco, I did think was good. Sorry I didn't find more to like!"}
{"text":"Pros: Great ambience. We sat outdoors which was a little chilly but they had overhead heaters. Great food. Cons: Slightly long wait, but it was a busy night. The server dropped an entire drink on me and was super apologetic. I assured her that it was fine. I was a disappointed that she didn't offer to offer me even a free drink or dessert or anything to make up for it. My friend finally asked her if she could not charge for my daughter's dessert and she agreed, but it was clear that she would not have offered herself."}
{"text":"I am torn about this place, I enjoy the bar and patio during game time and just hanging out with friends.  The place is always busy so these reviews dont hurt them much.  Sad to say but the only thing I order here is chicken wings...yes they do have them and they are not on the menu.  I do not care for their Mexican food at all and even their salsa is not that great.  I wish it were better but it does not seem to hurt their business because they are always packed.  I recommend going to Camineros across the street if you need Mexican and then get plastered here.  Very casual, good size bar and patio, service is always very good and other than the food I actually kind of like this place.  Ha ha, sorry Top Shelf"}
{"text":"I'd wish Yelp had 1/2 stars, I'd give 3.5 Stars.
Very friendly staff. I loved the table salsa. Mild, no heat. Which is great for me. I ordered the Chicken fundido. It was ok, tasted very cream cheesy and not alot of jalapeno which I like but  beware compared to ajo als this had no jalapenos at all I could see.  Beans and rice were bland."}
{"text":"It's a great neighborhood hang out spot for Friday or Saturday night if you don't want to drive out to Snottsdale or down to Westgate. It's the west valleys version of Cocomo Joe's, but substitute bad karoake for Cocomo's usually good cover bands. They do serve food, but it's par. But who really goes there to eat. The outdoor patio bar and indoor bar is where you will find all the regulars."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food!  I had the shredded beef burro enchilada style and my husband had the cheese and fajita chicken quesadilla.  Both very tasty!  Very big cold beers too for a very reasonable price.  Nice atmosphere in the bar and close to home."}
{"text":"Friendly staff- good service, but over all quality was lacking. Taco was greasy, green chili burrito was bland and almost dry.  The margaritas were watered down and didn't have much flavor. Started with the prickly pear and went to the jalapeño for hopefully more flavor and or kick- sadly they tasted the same.  Maybe it was an off night, but doubtful we will back.... the trip up to anthem for quality Mexican may be worth the extra miles and time."}
{"text":"Meh. I was SO excited on my first day back \"home\" in Phoenix. I wanted some amazing Mexican food. Sadly, it was not to be found at Top Shelf. 

I got the fajitas, which were not hardly seasoned and were not sizzling on a hot iron skillet. Just served on a plate. Very blah. 

The chips and salsa were good, but, the food....not so much. Go to Los Compadres on 7th Avenue and Campbell. Good, authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Blah. Blah food. A little cold even. Service was good. Not servers fault food is blah. But very blah"}
{"text":"Good service and good food.  Margaritas are weak...at least bend the elbow for $7.
No taste of alcohol... no buzz."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food, so although this place is good, its still average. Great patio!"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Steak fajitas is small pieces of steak not strips.   Prices are a little high.  Service is where a star was lost.   Waitress messed up order but thanked us for allowing her to fix it.   Then when we were packing up she offered a bag of chips and salsa to go.   We asked for it three times and only received salsa.   She implied she spoke too soon, and manager reprimanded her.    But still....the offer should have been honored.  It is close to my parents house so we will visit again."}
{"text":"Really good margaritas.  Their food isn't anything special.  I am particularly critical because I am capable of making my own Mexican food that is way better than this place.  I would say their food is more Americanized Mexican food than true Mexican food.  Their salsa tastes like tomato sauce from the can.  Their happy hour is pretty good though.  I tend just to stick to that menu along with the delicious margaritas."}
{"text":"Three of us went to Top Self about a week ago. We ordered 3 cocktails & 1 shot. A Tamale, Cheese crisp, Ground beef Enchiladas, Guac & Queso dip. We had a few rounds of chips and salsa. The people were personable. Although, I can see hospitality [here] may not be consistent. The food taste like it was cooked by Gringos. Absolutely nothing was authentic. Not even the chips & salsa. I had a good time chuckling w/ my group & sharing stories. However, the food here @ Top Self tastes like an employee at Circle K made it."}
{"text":"Just don't come here. Food is bland, service is subpar. All around no no no. Got to Garcia's."}
{"text":"Food was gross.. salsa had no flavor!  Hot sauce smelled like poop! Literally smelled like poop! Lunch service was slow.  Very expensive! Margarita was watery with no flavor! One waitress for an entire restaurant!  Had to wait up front for awhile waiting for someone to seat us!  I have not eaten at a top shelf for awhile! Cheese crisp was horrible!  Nachos were globbed all together!  Will stick to Macayos!"}
{"text":"These guys are awesome! It feels homey here, you get a lot of good tasting food for your money, the staff is always fun, and I like their place mats. My only complaint is it's hard to find the restaurant. At times I would drive past it. I've frequented this place a lot. It's spot on! Not sure why it has so many bad reviews.."}
{"text":"Crap service.  I hate when I go to a Mexican joint, and they never refill your drinks or chips.  

I went on a Saturday night, and it was semi-busy.  Our food came out quickly, but the waitress never came to check on us.  I shared an chimichanga meal with the boy, and it was very small for being $10.  The menu does not have a lot of selection, either.  I finished my margarita and  the waitress dropped off the check without asking if I wanted another.  I was planning on drinking more and getting dessert, but decided to bail after the poor service."}
{"text":"Terrible service and not busy. Waited 10 minutes while people around us who came in after us were served.bar manager didn't give a shit. Not worth it for average food. Done with this place! And this was the only place the wife and I ever went to. Need a New Mexican joint"}
{"text":"I ONLY put stars on this review because I was with my friend who posted her bad review of this place and she checked 0 stars which made her review be on the back page and putting stars hopefully will allow this review to be read. 
I feel this review should be seen by anyone wanting to eat here. This is the exact review that won't show up unless you go to the last pages!

 \"Hands down the WORST service I've ever had today!! A few friends went in after a baby shower to have lunch and not only did the waitress get over half of the orders wrong, she blamed US for ordering wrong! I'm sorry, but I dine out quite frequently and I know how to order. 

So after the waitress had argued with us for the third time, we walked out.  WITHOUT having eaten any food. Now get this, 15 min later the police showed up at my door, with my young son and niece watching, and accused us of stealing alcoholic beverages!!! 

Our waitress should know that my husband nor I ordered ANYTHING alcoholic! They threatened to arrest my husband because he didn't know the names of the friends of friends who were there that didn't pay for said alcohol. This is absurd! And embarrassing when my neighbors are inquiring as to why the police are at my home! 

Save yourself some grief and skip this place!!!! Valle Luna is just down the street & their food is amazing!!\""}
{"text":"Ugh. Highly overpriced. $14 for one small burro? No. Service was great, beer was cold. Food...meh. I'd rather eat elsewhere. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Top Shelf in almost 5 years... I forgot how good it was! 

My hubby and I came here last weekend for dinner (check out their website, they had a printable coupon when I was on there last week - hey it's a recession, I'll take what I can get!) 

Anyway, we usually end up wanting the same dish when we go out so we decided to pick 2 and share. I ordered the sampler platter and he ordered the Burrito Fundido. Both were excellent! I do recommend to ask for their \"hot sauce\" as the salsa they first give you is a little weak - just mix the two together for a perfect fix. Even my husband agreed the salsa needed some kick and he doesn't handle the hot stuff like I do. 

Now onto the awesome beer specials! 32 oz domestics for $4.75! My mug was so big I felt like I was doing bicep curls. Awesome. We asked the waitress, who was extremely attentive, what the beer price is like during \"happy hour\"... drum roll..... $3.95. I don't know how they stay in business with prices like that but I'm all for it. 

After dinner we moved into the huge bar area for another drink. They had so many flat screens I couldn't decide which one to watch. We visited on a Saturday night but left around 9pm to meet up with friends and the place was just as busy as when we arrived for dinner. That many people can't be wrong!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for 20+ years and the food is always top notch 5 stars. Better than other Mexican chains in valley, Vale Luna, Manuels ect.. The only issue I have coming here on Friday nights usually is the unnecessarily loud music being played in the bar area. Food is great, place is very good if you come here when it is not busy."}
{"text":"Well, I must say that this place just about met my expectations.  There are only a few things that make me a happy camper and this place failed at just about all of them.  Had to stand at an empty lobby with 2 hostesses' backs towards us for 5 minites before being greeted, and promptly shown to a table.  We were walked passed the inviting low lights to a back room that was brightly lit and kinda killed the allure. The server was actually pleasant, but not very attentive.  The chips and salsa came out quick, thank goodness, as expected.  I ordered the chicken chimi, and got a shredded beef chimi, bam!  My partner ordered a low carb grilled chicken thing and the chicken cutlet was pretty low quality, with a rubbery texture.  My chimichanga wasn't baf, but not what i had ordered.  It took a while for our server to come back around.  We just closed the bill and left.  Nothing about this place was Top Shelf. If i go back i will jist sit at the bar and drink. Caramba's is more Top Shelf than this place."}
{"text":"Very surprised at the low reviews. Food is very good and the service both times we have been there was exceptional."}
{"text":"This is near my parent's house.  
I like my parent's they are pretty cool people, and this is their bar.  Due to proximity and I'd guess little else.
If I show up when they are there, my beer is free.  
This is why I go to Top Shelf.

The service is hit of miss.  Sometimes the glasses are kept full, sometimes our part of the bar or our patio table is a barren desert that no one ventures to.
I'd say it's and 50/50 split.  
The chips are the standard free chips.  Sometimes we get the cheesy spinach dip, which is good, but nothing special to see here.

I really like my parents, and the free beers (when we can get them) so as long as they keep going, I'll keep going."}
{"text":"This place just isn't what it used to be.  Food has really gone downhill.  Our plates were mostly melted cheese.  Ugh.  After last nights two awful entrees, I'm done.  PS - This place needs a good cleaning."}
{"text":"Tiffany never brought my water. I asked seven times.

I was only here for karaoke."}
{"text":"I've been driving by here for some time and wondered if I was missing out by never eating here. Tonight we went. Nice atmosphere, greeted immediately and waited 5 min for a table. Well that was the highlight, went down hill from there. Salsa was so watery it wouldn't go in a chip. Mild and bland would describe. We ordered sodas and then food. The food took over 30 min, possibly 40. Very disappointed with dinner. I ordered carne asada taco dinner. In proportioned amount of onions, beans dry and crusty, meat dry and tortillas rubbery like they had been microwaved. Won't be back."}
{"text":"We sit in bar.  Like the food and people watching.  Many TVs with sports channels.  Kind of pricey.  Quick service when not busy.   Wait staff great and friendly.  Outdoor seating covered and misters"}
{"text":"Their fajitas are a disgrace to Mexican food.  I ordered fajitas from here and they brought out beef, onions and green pepper that were warm in a bowl.  It looked as if they just took the filling out of a burrito and threw it in a bowl and called it fajitas.  When I complained to the waiter about the food, he shrugged his shoulders and asked if I wanted something else.  I was so put off by the \"fajitas\" I didn't even want to try whatever else they were going to throw together.  The staff is rude and the food sucks.  Still can't believe they called meat in a bowl fajitas."}
{"text":"Super good chips and salsa. Salsa wasn't chunky and had good flavor. The chips were warm and the waitress kept them coming! Food was good and customer service was great. Would eat here again!"}
{"text":"$14 dollars worth of lettuce and over cooked chicken. Chicken was also bland(not enough seasoning). The Santa Fe Fajita salad was the most disappointing Mexican dish I've ever had and the worst part is they call themselves \"Top\" Shelf. I took a few bites and told them I don't want it. They didn't hesitate to charge me for it though . The waitress was good with words but could care less about the customer satisfaction. 

I will never be back. No wonder the place was empty! Poorly run with lazy chefs."}
{"text":"I love the food here.  The salsa is pretty good too.  My family and I go out to eat on Fridays so our daughter can hear the Mexican guy singing with his guitar.  She loves it.  I usually get the queso chimi as it's awesome."}
{"text":"Food: 2 stars
Service: 5 stars

Mom is visiting from out of town and loves mexican food. We didin't have time to hit our usual spots last Tuesday night so I suggested Top Shelf. We live close, it was close to our utlimate destination so we went. I already knew what to expect from Yelp reviews and speaking with friends. 

The food: Nothing was \"bad\", it just wasn't great. The salsa was good, not spicy enough for my taste but it was really good. The chips...not so good. Many of them tasted kind of burnt? 
Mom had a chimichanga and I had grilled mahimahi fish tacos. The chimi was ok. The tacos were ok as well. Small pieces of fish and they were absolutely loaded with shredded lettuce. The rice was bland but the beans were good. They don't use lard so that is a plus for me. 

The service was great. Our server, Penny was fast, attentive and friendly. She kept our glasses full and promptly brought more salsa for us."}
{"text":"DIRTY !!!!!! Counter in bar is nasty and smeared with icky salsa. Asked bartender to wipe it. Still gross."}
{"text":"We have lived in Phoenix for five months now and have been enjoying the chance to try new foods and restaurants. We recently ate at Top Shelf in Phoenix and it has been hands down our worst experience. The place was dirty, extremely slow service, overpriced, and the food was absolutely disgusting. I posted a photo earlier of my daughter's enchilada; the placed was full of grease. I didn't know I had order a side of grease, but they gave us plenty of it."}
{"text":"My order was a Burrito Fundido with chicken. It seemed under seasoned. I asked my girl about her tacos and she said that same thing. Both the hot and mild salsa were mediocre. I don't know. Maybe they cater to a different crowd on this side of town? It seems like it's nearly impossible to find good restaurants of any variety around here. We've been stuck with chain restaurants that leave much to be desired. The search continues..."}
{"text":"Ridiculous to wait 20 minutes for soda and to order!  Waitress busy sitting with friends on patio!  Then blamed the cook because the food was delivered cold - she was again on the patio.  Going from bad to worse fast!  Try Los Compadres"}
{"text":"I just can't get over the fact that they use canned pickled Jalapeños in their spicy margaritas 
. I mean... how lazy do you have to be?"}
{"text":"Love the food, but the last 2 times I went to this location, the wait staff was incredibly rude. I've started going to the Mesa location instead. This location used to be my absolute favorite, but not anymore. :("}
{"text":"I would have given a much higher rating but the nachos we ordered were disgusting.  They were swimming in the grease from the beef topping.  I literally poured it off the plate.  Had to ask the bartender for chips because we couldn't eat the ones on the plate because they were mush the minute they arrived.  Made a comment to the bartender who basically shrugged his shoulders.  Found the bar area to be fun and enjoyed the margaritas.  Will give it a second chance but will definitely not order the nachos again.  It's such an easy fix???  Ordered nachos a million times and never had that issue."}
{"text":"Yummy!! Riley was the best server ever!! Always had refills before we asked, food was excellent, I definitely recommend spinach queso dip!!"}
{"text":"overall very fast and good. got out orders taken right when we sat down and it came out quick. my chimichanga and my friends tacos were dank but just a lil greasy. apparently guac is usually like 4 dollars which is def overpriced but my food came with it so we gucci. only complaint is that the kids menus are WAY too hard. i'm 18 years old and the word search took me like 15 minutes. i could not imagine the tantrums this might cause in real kids"}
{"text":"I give this place a SOLID four stars!!! The food is certainly GOOD, the chips and salsa are fresh and enjoyable and the service has always been quick and super friendly!! We have been going to this location for a couple DECADES and we will continue to do so!! In fact, we are headed to Top Shelf TONIGHT for dinner!!! Looking forward to a yummy meal!!

I am left wondering if the bashers are related or friends of another Mexican restaurants in the area (one in particular right across the street) or other Mexican restaurants or restaurants in the area and surrounding area?? It makes no sense to me to see so many bad reviews!!!! Ignore the whiners and give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"Food here used to be good!  Now our last visit, we were sat at a booth that we had to wipe the seat first, the wall surrounding us looked as if it had not been cleaned in quite some time (the dead fly on the window sill confirmed this).  The wait staff not to professional, I know we live in Arizona but I prefer not to look at the butt cheeks of waitresses hanging out as I am eating, they really need to go to a pant uniform instead of those shorts.  Free chips and salsa, um they have gone to using these small bowls that barely fit a handful in them and they were gone before we received our drinks.  The cheese crisp has been reduced to might as well not waste your money portion size and last 2 times here have had to send it back as I told the waitress I ordered a cheese crisp not a burnt crisp.  Food comes out and is blah, my taco shell is hard and tastes stale, her enchilada is so blah she eats a quarter of it and we bring it home and threw it to the dogs to eat.  Their was a time I was so unhappy before leaving at the hostess desk I spoke to the so called manager on duty, he seemed as if I was interrupting his busy time which consisted of not doing much.  I told him of that bad experience and he made no real attempt to make it right just stood shaking his head, ( probably figured he already had our money your bothering me just go away), well I told you then another bad experience and I will not be back so not only will I not be back but I am writing this review and making sure to tell everyone I know of your restaraunt and it being in their best interest to steer clear."}
{"text":"The food is average at best, as is the service. It is not overpriced for what you are served but if you love authentic Mexican food you might be disappointed if you find yourself here. After having eaten here 5 or so times in the past year, if I could give it 2.25 stars I would just to be nice.

I imagine there may be a loyal group of people who would argue with me considering the large crowd that turns up for this place every Friday & Saturday night, but I have to be honest when I say I have never received anything that was delicious. I can say, however, that what I ate was edible, did not cause me to be ill and I have always left feeling full. I believe that having a 2nd glass of wine helps. A lot. 

My husband and I meet friends here for dinner from time to time who love to come here because it is their routine. They well are known by the servers and are always treated well as a result. I would never consider coming here other than to meet our friends who are very comfortable dining here."}
{"text":"My new favorite place!   Food is wonderful, atmosphere nice.  Our waitress was the best, very accommodating .. Very attentive to the kids in our party."}
{"text":"Ate here tonite, and it was not good. Two of us ordered the Fajita style fundido. All it was was strips of chicken stuffed inside a flour tortilla, with jalapeño cream cheese sauce on the top. No peppers or onions inside, dry and terrible!"}
{"text":"Went here for pickup came home to find that the steak fajitas were with Veggies that I said I didn't want. Get to cheese crisp to find a hair in it. Call the top shelf to be told there won't credit it. Don't plan to return here again."}
{"text":"The service here is always great. We usually sit in the bar, good atmosphere, Always on top of refilling chips and salsa, drinks, and very consistent! The Mexican pizza with ground beef is amazing!"}
{"text":"I hate to write a bad review because when we walked in everyone was so nice.. But nice can only go so far. We ordered steak and chicken fajitas and when our order came out it was chicken and shrimp. When we told our waitress she tried to just tell us oh but the shrimp is so good and i only charged you for the chicken, but thats not the point. We didnt order shrimp.. And it isnt what we wanted. So then they ended up cooking us a side of steak but then when we asked for more tortillas she told us she would have to charger us, yet you messed up our order? So we said thats okay we are fine. & then our bill comes and we were charged for two pepsi's when we ordered one iced tea and one water. So we told the lady we only ordered one drink, and she said ok ill take that off, when she took the bill back we also handed her $40.00  she came back and opened her book on the table and started to count out my change.. Which i thought was weird because normally you do that in the kitchen or at a computer instead of looking for change and saying you dont know if you have it, so i told her dont worry about the change part of it. So the total was 20.89 something around there and she handed me back 14.00 so she shorted me $5.00 by then I was ready to just get out of the place so I left but wanted to let the resturant know I did tip her $5.00 on top of this... Just in case she accidently did count the change back wrong or idk if she was taking out her own tip? Either way I was bothered by this expierience this whole day and I will not be returning because of this."}
{"text":"Top Shelf has lost our business. Honestly they are hit or miss. Sometimes we came & everything was fine but other times forget it, it was awful. The chimichanga base price is outrageous as everything else is a la carte. Nearly all Mexican restaurants offer rice or beans or both and you can have guacamole or sour cream. Top Shelf charges $2.25 or something for a butter pat of guacamole. Way too expensive for the quality. Then when we said something about the cost of their guacamole, the guy says something like \"well I don't set the prices.\" How rude. We are finished with this place. With so many Mexican places to choose from, they should try to stand out more."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican but far from Top Shelf.  

They are a bit overpriced for what you get as I got one taquito with beans and rice for $8.  

Salsa is a bit watery for my taste and not spicy enough.  

Rice and beans were good and that is more than a lot of Mexican places can say.  

Service was great I got a drink refill before I even asked for it and that means a lot to me."}
{"text":"Great food and prices for lunch, our waitress was very polite and our food came out very fast. The patio area was my favorite part especially since it was such a nice day out."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican in the Peoria area. Salsa is so good. Chips are thin and crispy. Good variety of tequila!  Portions are ok to split. Servers are so friendly and attentive. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience bartender was rude when I walked him I said I'm here for a pick up since I did a phone order. He told me u must be lost I don't have nothing. Then I said no I been coming for years I'm sure I would know if I went to the wrong place he refused to check if their was an order placed then he remembered like 10 min later that I had place one. Bad enough I had bad customer service then they put tomatoes on my tacos after I verified with him twice he said they were only cheese then for me to get home and be disappointed. Worst experience I've had."}
{"text":"Love the bar but not the food!

We end up here fairly often and we're always in the bar.  They have good prices on drinks, the full menu of food and there are plenty of TVs with many different sporting events to choose from.  The bar staff is always good at changing the channels for us too.

I've eaten in the restaurant once and I found the meals to be lame.  Greasy, bland and sub-par for the Phoenix market.  I do order food in the bar sometimes but I have to be very selective, sticking to grilled items like the grilled fish tacos, which are OK.  I'll eat my share of chips & salsa in the bar too.  They're nothing special but not gross at all.

Last thing is about Karaoke... STOP IT!   It drives us out every time we're there and Karaoke starts.  Way too loud for people who shouldn't get handed a mic."}
{"text":"Last review 6 years ago.  Top shelf has gone downhill.  Last night was the last straw.  Place was not packed, service was slow and food was mediocre. 
Adding more television does not improve the restaurant."}
{"text":"We were there for football Sunday.  So understaffed! Our waiter gave us our bill before half time and  wasn't seen once after that to check on us! Obviously the intent is to stay for the game.  We will never go back there for Sunday football."}
{"text":"We live close by to this restaurant and have been going here for years.  The last few months we have noticed the service has REALLY went down hill!!!  it used to be great, but not anymore.  We have went there many times when it's not busy at all and takes forever for anyone to wait on us and when we finally do get a waiter they are nowhere to be found to refill our drinks or chips... we have literally wondered where the heck our waiter went because we don't see them in the area for an extremely long time.... and when there is hardly anyone in the restaurant??? what the heck are they doing?... playing and socializing in the back?!!!  There used to be a LOT more help there, but I guess management doesn't care about their customers anymore and has Jumped the Shark so to speak... oh, and another thing.... there has been numerous times when we walk in and the entire restaurant smells like dirty mop water BAD.  It smells disgusting.... get it together Top Shelf or you are going to get a bad reputation and start sinking!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my lunch here very much.
A nice portion for a nice price.
Chips were thin and crisp; warm and just the right saltiness.
Salsa was pretty good, but mix regular and hot sauce for the best roasty flavor.

I really enjoy service from more experienced servers.  They're super friendly and you never see extra facial holes or anything like that.  
I love being called \"Hon\", too. 8^ )

Everything was clean and comfortable.

Might be my most boring review ever."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful here.  One of my top 10 favorite Mexican food restaurants.  I highly recommend it.  Chimis are awesome here.  So are the margaritas!"}
{"text":"My family and I have gone to this restaurant for years and have always enjoyed it. Last nights service was absolutely terrible. I understand it was cinco de mayo and was busy and we expected that. Around 5 we called and asked what the wait time was for a table in the restaurant for 9 and we were told about an hour. We asked if they could put our name down as we would be heading up there right then and they said no they couldn't do that over the phone we had to be there to put our name down. So 5:20 we get there and put down Katy for a party of 9. Around 6 we asked how it was looking and they said about another 30 minutes. 6:30 comes around and we ask and they said \"we are still waiting on some tables to get up\" we continue waiting outside as we hear parties of 2,3,5 get called in for seating. 7 we ask again, do you know about how much longer? We are told they are still waiting on tables to open. We ask for some waters outside for us and the girl who brought them out walked away rolling eyes as we tried asking about our table. I get it was busy and maybe frustrating we kept asking, but it had been nearly 2 hours.  At 7:20 again we ask, we are told there is a party of 12 ahead of us now because they called in and put their name down. Immediately we are frustrated as we are told you don't do that. So my husband is asking why? We were told you can't do that?? And the girl in the front with the black shirt and long blonde hair in a pony tail, who was anything but nice, rudely says \"well I don't know I just work here\" so we ask to speak to the manager. The manager, woman in a green dress with brown hair, comes over and we explain the situation and she says they called us a while ago. That she was even outside calling us. I told her that's not true, we watched her coming outside calling people never once called us and I'm sorry but there were 9 of us, if you truly called someone would have heard. Or every 15-30 min we went inside wouldn't someone had said oh we just called you rather than sending us away saying they were waiting on tables to clear for us? But she continued to argue saying she called us and said they would figure something out for us. Then she says she's sorry because there has been some confusion up front, clearly realizing they were wrong. So finally we are seated in a booth with two high top chairs at the end. Not the most comfortable but we didn't care at that point. Our server was very nice and quick to serve us which we appreciated and they did order a couple cheese crisps for us since we had been waiting so long which was nice. So we finally got to order and eat. By the time we left (which was right after we ate since it was so late) was 9:30. 4 hours of being there. Again I know it's a busy day, but seems a little absurd and the service in the front by the host and manager was uncalled for."}
{"text":"I have to drop this place a star.... sad day. And it's not the food either.... I went here last night with a group of friends for karaoke and drinking. It was some of the worst karaoke I have ever experienced. First of all, it was deafeningly loud. I couldn't hear anyone talking over the ridiculous karaoke and sometimes (most times) that is made worse by the people singing. The main problem, though, was the guy who runs the karaoke was completely pompous and would sit there and sing songs while paying customers in the bar (like my table of 6) hadn't gotten to sing one in the hour we had been there. He obviously had people that he knew and would let them go repeatedly as we sat around and waited. He even started playing the wrong song for someone and when they complained he said 'uhh that's the number you put down' as if the customer was just so stupid for not just knowing all the karaoke CDs he had. Then he played the entire track with no one singing.... while we waited and he stuffed his face with chips.  It's just so lame.... the guy acted like he was the king sh**, but really he was just a jerk and turned off a lot of customers that may come to the bar on a saturday night. We didn't eat... but the food is still really good from my other visits here and they did give us some chips and salsa while we were drinking. The drinks were fine, priced appropriately, but I wouldn't go back here again for drinks. I still would come here for food... yum. Chicken fajita burrito fundido FTW!"}
{"text":"Best place to eat Mexican food!  Salsa #1.  Shredded beef #1.  Service #1.  Very friendly staff.  Most are veteran servers who want you to enjoy you food and the service. They get really busy.  If you aren't patient, then go later...just don't take my booth:)"}
{"text":"Still my go-to place for decently priced Mexican food. Been coming here for YEARS! Love the crew and management. 

But, you lose a star for losing karaoke"}
{"text":"They used to have karaoke at this location...not sure if that's still a thing. Honestly, the last two times I've attempted to eat at this location, it was closed. And...not really during hours I would expect it to be closed.

Additionally, the last time I DID eat here, I got a shredded beef burro. The thing was mostly fat. I never have this problem ordering the same exact thing at the Greenway location.

The service also isn't great. It's slow and the servers talk hurriedly and it just isn't conducive to a good visit."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, but never have had the unbelievable service we had today. Amazing waitress. Extremely friendly. Had a great time and the food was excellent"}
{"text":"Ok food. 2 star due to bathroom smelling like a truck stop....easy fix tho"}
{"text":"Too much cheese is right...and it resembled processed cheese.  The place looked dirty and we brought it to the attention of a waitress after we watched all bus staff, when cleaning off  tables, push the left over food onto the floor!  Customers then walked over the rice and chips and yuck.  We asked a waitress who was using a floor sweeper why they do this and she said that is how it is done, she didn't know why \"but the rice is hard to get up.\"  Well, yes."}
{"text":"I've been here coming here since the place opened, although not nearly as much as I once did. I met a couple of clients today at Top Shelf, not my choice or I'd would of offered another suggestion. 
I agree with the large majority of previous comments and highly agree that this place needs to be closed down, renovated, professionally cleaned and reopened under new management."}
{"text":"I have eaten there in the past and the food was decent. I took mu wife there this weekend and ordered grilled fish tacos. They were terrible. Really no fish. Just a very small amount of this disgusting chopped up fish stuff. Not even sure it was fish. A weird color. Basically I paid 12.95 for lettuce and cheese tacos with beans and rice. I will never go back. Not one person asked me how my food was. Probably knew the answer."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 20 years. Tonight my wife and were at Top Shelf late, probably the last customers of the evening. Seated in the restaurant, not the bar. Utterly disappointed trying to have a conversation with the employees' loud foul language, inluding F-bombs from the bartender and a longtime favorite waitress coming from the bar. (She was apparently clocked out and drinking at the bar, so at this point she is a patron but still a representative of the establishment). We will no longer support this restaurant. Don't bring the kids to this \"family\" place late at night."}
{"text":"Good food, decent prices - my son (2 years old) likes the kids meal. Can get a house margarita for $5.50 at happy hour. Worth visiting"}
{"text":"Hadn't eaten at a Top Shelf for several years. Happened upon this one and I'm glad I did.

Starting with the chips and salsa, they were both fresh and tasty. My waiter, Dave, was very helpful and quick. The food (chicken tacos with beans and rice) were also fresh and very good.

Maybe not the best ever place for Mexican food, but it certainly is well above average. Good prices for the portions, too."}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was in high school and lived a mile away; so about 25 years.

There is another location closer to me in Peoria near 75th Avenue and Deer Valley Road. I've been to that location a few times and the food isn't as good at that location. There also used to be a location in Mesa at Southern and Dobson but the service was terrible at that location and the food wasn't good either. That location is now closed.

The Greenway location however consistently has terrific food and my usual order are the shredded beef tacos. These are my all-time favorite tacos and I introduced my wife to this restaurant when we were dating and she agrees with that assessment. If we are hungry enough we'll get a cheese crisp with green chilis which is really tasty. I've also had the chimichanga and enchiladas which are also quite good.

My family is quite fond of this place as well as my wife's friends who live in upstate New York. Every time they come to visit they want to go here.

We get coupons in the mail via the Clipper every month which saves us anywhere between $5 and $10 depending on how much you spend so it's possible to get a meal here really cheap.

We eat here every 1-2 months and we've never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and even greater service! Bethany was the sweetest and attentive server. She made our family happy with her cheerfulness and awesome service! Thank you Bethany! You're the Bestany!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with my Mother-in-Law on a Tuesday around 11:15 for a quick lunch. We opted to sit in the bar area, I estimate 8 people sharing the space, 2 sitting at the bar with everyone else at booths surrounding it. Quickly we decided to just share a cheese crisp. We order from the bartender. 2 ice teas and the cheese crisp. She brings our drinks along with chips and salsa.

Chips were ok, nothing special and lacking salt. Salsa was fairly fresh but the hot and mild even though they looked different they tasted exactly the same. After about 10 minutes bartender dropped off our cheese crisp. I was a little surprised. One, it was served on a dinner plate, unlike most area Mexican restaurants where they serve on a large silver platter. Even though it was small in size but for the $5 and change price it was fine for us to share for lunch. Two, it was cold, the cheese (what little there was, it did not even cover the tortilla in spots and I don't mean the edges, I mean the middle) was no longer melted but had solidified. And the tortilla was extremely hard. Even though we could see the cut marks where the individual slices should have been we had to break small pieces off to eat. When we tried to cut through it broke in tiny pieces and the tortilla turned to crumbs.

Our waitress/ bartender never came back to our table. Never came back to refill our teas, never came back to see if our food was to our satisfaction, never came back to see if we wanted to order anything else. We sat there with our plates and table wear and our empty glasses at the end of our table for a good 15 minutes after finishing before she came to give us our bill. Maybe our service suffered because our check was only $12 and figured her tip wasn't going to be much. But how did she know if we wanted to share a dessert? Didn't even ask. 

Along with the below average food and nonexistent service I would probably never go back to Top Shelf, how do you mess up a cheese crisp! With so many dining options in the Arrowhead area I suggest you pass up Top Shelf unless you are desperate."}
{"text":"I love the convenience of this place since it's so close to my house. The bar is great with tons of TV's, they have fun karaoke and good service. The food is just meh. Very typical Mexican food, decent chips and salsa. You probably won't get a bad meal, just good atmosphere and decent food."}
{"text":"First visit to Top Shelf and we probably will go back.
 Our server, Robert brought us some chips and salsa.  The salsa was mild and was perfect, but a bit watery.  I made a mess.
  He was really great when we ordered by helping us choose and his recommendations were spot on.
  I had the seafood enchilada with green chili sauce and hubby had the chicken chimi.
  Mine had shrimp and imitation crab and was pretty tasty.  The sauce was nice and it had just the right amount of cheese.
  Hubby liked his chimi and it was huge.  He could barely finish it.
The chips and salsa were refilled without asking as was our drinks.
  Next time I want to try a margarita and also the lunch specials, for under $10 it looks like you get a heck of a deal!"}
{"text":"The food continues to get better here... My wife and I used to frequent this place often but took a hiatus when the quality went down (about 3-4 years ago)... We started coming back in and the service and food is much better... I love the way they prepare their fajitas... Their enchiladas are delicious and their Margaritas are awesome!!! Try the High Roller Margarita!!"}
