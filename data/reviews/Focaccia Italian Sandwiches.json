{"text":"Place was awesome. Had the chicken penne ros√® lunch special. Got the lunch special so the pasta plus salad was 8.00. Staff was awesome, the lady that works there took care of us so well. Everything took 3-5 minutes to get ready. Deff worth it, plan on going back soon."}
{"text":"4-5 daily pastas to go, an assortment of made to order sandwiches, and consistency make this takeaway place a well traveled resto in the Yonge & Bloor area.   $8 pastas, with a choice of meat (chicken, veal, or meatballs) & salad are perfect for those days when you want a filling lunch to take back to your desk.   This is the sister business of the dine-in Focaccia (I believe they share a kitchen), and while the focus is on food to go, there is some limited seating if you want to sit down as well.   I go here at least once a week, because the portions are big, the quality is consistent every time, and the owner's 70-something mother works on the kitchen to fashion those delicious homemade sausages and meatballs.   Bring your appetite, but leave your pretensions at home. This place isn't fancy, just good."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch one day for eat in.  This is the \"hole in the wall\" sister to Focaccia two doors down.   I had the $8 special. I got the chicken cutlet, Caesar salad, and pasta.  It was not as large a portion as I was expecting, but basically hit the spot.  The pasta and red sauce seemed kind of plain.  Cutlet was nice, but nothing special.  Caesar salad was lightly dressed [almost too lightly], but was good.  All in all, the combo was  par for the course for the area.  I think $8 including taxes is an OK price for the food.  I don't know if any other Italian food in the area in a comparable price range.  I would go to this place again, but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"You can't really have any complaints when you get a veal sandwich for 10 bucks. The actual sandwich was a very fair size, and full of flavor.   Bang for you buck is an understatement!   GS27"}
