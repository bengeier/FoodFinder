{"text":"Great, thin-crust gourmet pizza at an amazing price.  The portions are HUGE. I grew up in the suburbs so the only pizza I ever had was from the frozen food aisle or Pizza Pizza. One slice at Papa Ceo's is easily 2.5 the size of one slice at Pizza Pizza! Plus, it is $3 for a slice of garlic or pepperoni; the fancier ones with more toppings are $4 or $5. I'd recommend the Tina Turner, Rambo for the meat lovers, or the Al Pacino.   This place also used to have an awesome lunch deal - one slice pepperoni or garlic + a bottle of beer = $5..so awesome! Unfortunately they raised the price to $7. Still pretty awesome. They are also open till 5am on weekends - my go-to for drunk food, especially since it is on the way home! This late I'd recommend going for the simple slices because they're usually fresher.  Going in when you're drunk is also hilarious as they always have strange Italian movies playing and Papa Ceo will start making jokes with you."}
{"text":"My order took over 2 hours. They took the deliver charge off - $2 My Caesar salad was like soup, must have been dressed at least an hour before. I won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"A downtown pizza classic.   This was my regular spot for a few years. Fortunately for my belly and my girlfriend, I moved to North York. So my previous attendance record is no longer achieved.   Best 3 dollar slice of pepperoni in Toronto. They make the dough, they serve it hot and sizable. The slices start to look a little shabby by the end of the night, but your lunch should always be fresh.   A personal favorite."}
{"text":"Loved this place!   We had a craving for pizza after staying up all night to watch the Royal Wedding (Yelp is not a place for judgement!) and then sleeping all day.   We were going to get Mamma's but every time we order from them, it arrives cold and needs to be heated up. This is probably something to do with how the deliveries are made (we always wait 1+ hour for our food, so we assume it spends at least a little time with the delivery guy while he makes other rounds), and we usually overlook it because the pizza tastes great after 10 minutes in the oven. Still, we wanted pizza *now* so we decided to try Papa Ceo's.   Long story short, it was awesome. The kind of NYC grease but with a thin crunchy base and a puffy crust. My only problem was that they were a little skimpy on the sauce. I like my pizza saucy!   Better than Pizza Pizza or Mamma's by a mile!!"}
{"text":"frequented this place quite regularly throughout grad school (i lived right across the street at Graduate House for 2 years) ... i came to like this place better than Cora's, even if the pizzas might not be the freshest. they are nevertheless pretty tasty. i think the Terminator slice is definitely the best. the slices that are more meat-heavy, such as the Brando, are not as good imo. and, yes, the place could use a thorough cleaning. but it's a good bang for the buck."}
{"text":"Its been a few years since I have been back to Papa Ceo's pizzeria and I had ordered a large pizza over the phone for pickup as they used to have a 9.99 pickup special at the store. They first of all failed to tell us that they had free delivery. They then provided us with specials that were not the one's that we had suggested. Showing up to the store to our surprise we found out there was a 9.99 pickup special and on top of that free delivery had we requested. We paid 17 dollars for a large two topping pizza that was beyond undercooked (we requested well done) and the cheese was barely melted. The pizza had barely any sauce and the dough tasted like it was defrosted from a stash of frozen crusts in the basement. It seemed as if the pizzeria was taken over by a bunch of idiots that don't know how to make pizza as they all seemed to be new faces. This place used to be a favourite of my lacrosse team after practice as it was just up the road, but wow, I didn't think it was even possible pizza could make someone that angry. You guys need to re-evaluate your model because that pizza is disrespectful beyond measure to papa Ceo. On top of that the slices in the window appeared old and had flies crawling all over them. Go to Cora's next door."}
{"text":"I'm a Cora's fan.  Papa Ceo's is good but the crust is not as light and thin as Cora's, and it is a bit more doughy tasting. They have an amazing selection of pizza though, I love all the vegetarian options. So when I want selection, I come here. They would be my favorite, but the pizza's are not as fresh tasting to me. A great deal for the money since you get 2 giant slice for $4."}
{"text":"Gross pizza. There is never enough sauce!!! Both of my experiences and my boyfriend's first and only experience were almost completely devoid of sauce. As in, you can pull back the cheese and the bread underneath is white with small smears of red where the sauce was supposed to be. And yes, these are slices that should have had tomato sauce.  I think people must like Papa Ceo's because there isn't a lot of good cheap fast food in the immediate area. But if you like juicy pizza, skip this place."}
{"text":"Undercooked. terrible dough. basically no toppings. Wings are inedible. How is this place still in business...barf."}
{"text":"I'm new to the city and figured I would try out some of the local flavor. I heard from a former U of T student about Papa CEOs and Cora's - side by side. She told me which one was better and I honestly can't remember which one!  I decided to try this place first because honestly they had seating.  I was a little surprised to see pizza places so quiet overall on Saturday evening, but I'm new here so in probably missing the boat on something.    I'm from NJ originally - just outside NYC and I know what NY style pizza is supposed to be like. This is not it. Sorry. Cheese was a thick slab on top of a very chewy thick crust (for NY style standards). That said, the meat slice was perfectly passable as something to eat and would probably make a great late night snack with a few beers already down the hatch. The price was good too -$5 for one (big) slice and a Coke.  If I'm right here and hungry I'll give it a go again, but I don't expect that I'll seek it out specifically."}
{"text":"I just really like the guys there. Sweethearts. Pizza is inventive, the Pavarottie is incredible!"}
{"text":"Oh the days of going to Papa Ceo's have changed.  I remember back in the day my friends and I would go here around 2 am after the clubs and have your pizza slices by the car or in the restaurant.  Always have it with chocolate milk.  Always a tradition to me.  Well the last time I visited there last Friday night with my gf because she's from Hamilton and didn't know about this hidden secret.  I noticed a difference though.  I think they changed the dough because the crust seemed thinner than it used to be.  I should have asked for it to be put back in the oven so it could be warmer while my gf's slice was much warmer.   The guy behind the counter didn't realize I was with my gf and asked me is that all almost like he was quick to get my order done, even though no one was next in line.    Back in the day, I would give the place a 4 or 5.  I think it's gone down a notch or two.  Maybe when I'm in the mood for a late night slice when I visit Toronto again, I'll possibly visit.  But for now, I'll stay away.  :("}
{"text":"I love Papa Ceo's. When I lived in Mississauga, about 30 minutes west of T.O., I would drive into the city just to sink my teeth into a big-ass slice of fresh italian pizza. It was gourmet, long before gourmet \"authentic\" Italian pizza joints became trendy. It was a giant slice of heaven, whether it was 11 a.m. or 3 a.m. it didn't matter. I loved standing in the steaming little shop rowed by glass cases filled with steaming hot pizzas of every conceivable combination. Big ass pizzas, not your conservative 12-inch, like you get on menus these days, masquerading as large. Big-ass. And over two dozen choices. My favourite was Sophia Loren, a veggie masterpiece. I never really gave Cora's pizza next door any thought, until I learned of the friendly rivalry between the two places that often erupts late at night as drunk partiers line up for a slice. I once tried Cora's and it was excellent too, but pizza loyalty has a way of invading even your taste buds."}
{"text":"They have a large pizza special. Call them, but be patient on the phone, they can be kinda rude. Walking in is another option if you're around the campus. Quality is what you expect from a mom-pop pizza, \"good enough\". Open very late. Iconic.  Roomier dining area than Cora's."}
{"text":"This is a desperate man's pizza. It's 3am, everything is closed and you're having the biggest cravings ever. You desperately call this place and you get...well, a desperate pizza.   The sauce is non-existent. I would describe the flavour but there is none. The dough is dry and the entire pizza is just a mess in general.  I felt like I was eating plato with plastic cheese. My friends felt like barfing.  Definitely not worth the calories. You're honestly better off going to bed hungry."}
{"text":"I have frequented this place all throughout the school year, and I think I can confidently say that Papa Ceo is one of my favourite pizza places in the area.  I fail to recall a time when I left disappointed.  Venue:  There really isn't anything fancy about this place.  It's pretty old and the sitting area consists of several metal table/chair combo fixtures you might find in older mall food courts.  They are pushed right up to the wall so it can difficult to access sometimes should you decide to sit near the wall.  The staff keep the area decently clean, but sometimes I think it could be cleaner.  This has never really bothered me personally, but don't expect much should you decide to dine in.  In terms of their hours and location, Papa Ceo is easily accessible to U of T students in the area and are open quite late, closing at around 3-4 am most days of the week.    Food:  If you are looking for slices, they offer 8-9 different kinds of pies you can choose from (availability can vary depending how quickly they sell) and range from your traditional margherita to unique flavours like clam chowder.  I've probably tried them all and haven't found one I disliked.  The pizza is made New York style (thin crust).  I find the crust to be crisp on the outside yet kinda fluffy and soft on the inside which is something I really like in a crust.  At $4.50 a slice (tax in) the portion size is more than generous (seriously, it's like a quarter of a pizza) and easily fills you up for lunch or dinner.  If slices aren't your thing, they offer a few deals for full pies and a long list of different toppings to choose from.  For what you get, i'd say their prices are quite fair.  Customer Service:  While staff come and go, the quality of service has always been great.  Definitely more than I would expect from a pizza place.  Every time I've walked in, everyone seemed happy, friendly, and were smiling.  They've always greeted me when I walked in and thanked me as I walked out the door.  It doesn't seem like much, but when you've had a rough/crap day (and believe me I've had many this year), it's the little things like this that really help make the day just a bit more bearable (well, at least for me).  Overall, Papa Ceo is a great pizza place.  Despite the appearance of the venue, I think the quality, price, and size of the pizza is great.  I highly recommend giving this place a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Go to Coras next door.  This place always has all these flies crawling on the pizzas........it's seriously disgusting"}
{"text":"Legendary pizza place on Harbors Street. Absolutely massive slices for $4. Bacially the size of two slices af Pizza Pizza. I've only had the Pepperoni and Hawaiian here, I'd like to try the Al Pacino or the Marlon Brando. Service was brisk, the ambiance is pretty meh but still a decent place for a slice of ZA."}
{"text":"Used to eat here alot during undergrad now it's only if I happen to be in the area...quality is still good as always. Do not even think of going to the god awful Pizza Pizza instead of here, Papa Ceo puts lotsa love in da pizza pie."}
{"text":"Don't let the griminess and unsanitary looking environment deter you-this place is tha shiiiiit.   The names of the pizza varieties are hilarious and make one really wonder if there is any relation to the celebrity the slice is named after and the toppings (ex. pablo picasso slice, albrto banini slice)  However the man that I usually deal with isn't the most friendly so not someone that I was able (not that I put much effort, frankly) to strike up a chat with... that being said one time there were younger women working there and with my to-go slice they threw in 2 free cheese slices. I didn't ask or tell, just left with an enormous smile :-)  Another negative is that sometimes the pizza can be a little dry. But let's face it-even bad pizza is amazing. And this pizza is never bad.   A plus-it's open to the wee hours of the morning and when it's nice weather, you can sit on the little bench outside and eat.   This is probably my favourite pizza joint.  The competitor two doors down often gets people's dedication but I'm stickin' with Papa.   YUUUMMMM....PIIIZZZZAAAAAA!!!"}
{"text":"Papa Ceo is very close to UofT so it's a convenient location for students. I had the deluxe pizza and it was a good slice. It was $4 with no tax. I would come back for a quick lunch between classes."}
{"text":"My fave place hands down, for high volume mid range pizza.   Hours are amazing and closest thing to real woppy pizza you can get.   The owner is the real deal Sicilian and the coolest cat to serve pizza."}
{"text":"Best place to go when you have $5 and need to stop that pizza craving. Late-night adventures, or after your workout at the UofT Athletic Centre, this place has your pizza desires covered.  2/5 - Venue 4/5 - Food 3/5 - Overall  I dropped by after my workout at the AC across the street, as a friend recommended their massive slices. See my photo for the size of the slice, it's one quarter of a 14\"-16\" pizza. Definitely filled me up on a $5.50 slice and pop combo.  Venue: The location is your typical unassuming late night pizza joint, and they run until about 3:00 to 4:00AM. This means what you think it means - the inside is pretty old and worn down. However the owners do manage a decent level of cleanliness, and the tables are not too bad. Just don't expect to be seated comfortably on metal grate chairs and in a dimly lit and dark room.  Food: I had one slice of their meat lovers pizza, which had your usual pepperoni, ground meat, and bacon bits. The slice was massive, and will easily fill you up for lunch. They offer a selection of free dressings, like BBQ sauce, parmesan, hot sauce and herbs. The dough is nothing special, not as thin as others have compared to NY style pizza. The toppings are VERY generous, and the cheese is not sparse. However, the sauce is thinly spread, and whatever of it you can taste, it is lacking the sweet tomato flavor that comes with quality marinara.  Overall: Great spot for cheap eats, and you will not leave hungry. Around $4 for just a slice, you will not be disappointed if you're hungry or out on a late night. Taste is similar quality to Pizza Pizza, but portions are larger. All around decent pizza joint."}
{"text":"Worst pizza place ever. The pizza slice is very hard to chew. I think they must put it for more than one day. It's cheap but tastes horrible."}
{"text":"Ordered this on ubereats. Not good at all. No tomato sauce on it at all. On top of that it had no flavour and they forgot a topping. Do not recommend, yuck."}
{"text":"I've heard very mixed reviews of this place, but then learned it was under new management, so decided to check it out. Staff were super friendly and helpful. The pizza was probably some of the best pizza i've had since New York City. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My new pizza ordering spot !! Unbelievably amazing pizza. And since it's around Christmas time they even sent me a Christmas card with my order thanking me & 2 free cokes. My first time ordering from here and won't be my last. The customer service here is amazing. Keep it up !"}
{"text":"absolute garbage. 0 stars. flies crawling all over the slices. smells gross. pizza barely had any tomato sauce. pepperonis were like the ones from a lunchable. cheese is plastic crap. I'm royally PISSED off & papa ceo would be too!!!!!! gross!"}
{"text":"Mama-mia, papa-ria! Papa's is a university hot spot for late night greasy cravings.  They have a wide selection of pizza, many named after Hollywood stars, like the Al Pacino. They also have a great selection for vegetarians and even a cheeseless pizza if that's your cup of tea.   Papa behind the counter is super friendly, which is quite refreshing after a long day at work. There's a small tv in the back of the store, where you can sit (i think there's about 6 four seat tables), the tables themselves don't seem to be regularly cleaned - I think there the do-it yourself place, and the chairs aren't overly comfortable, but this isn't the type of place you sit and chill for a few hours.    Overall their pizzas are pretty good. They aren't the greatest. Each slice is massive, a quarter of the pizza. The sauce is pretty good, but I've had better dough/crust elsewhere.   For $7 you can get a slice of pizza and a beer, not bad for dinner! Each slice is around $4 on its own."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 20 years.   Other than the owners, nothing has changed.  The new lady on the till is fast and very nice.     I LOVE their slices. Not too doughy, but not dry either.    Good mid day through late night!!!!"}
{"text":"opens late, close to u of t, always hot pizza, generous amounts. mm-mmm"}
{"text":"Papa Ceo's Pizza was the go-to pizza joint during the 1990's.  They had a large variety of pizza styles to choose from.   They compete with Cora's right next door except Papa Ceo's actually has a few little tables that you can sit on.  The owner of Pap Ceo's ended up opening a pizza parlor in Puerto Vallarta.  Since then, the quality of the pies just are not what they used to be.  The recipes are somewhat the same but the \"love\" that went into them has long since been forgotten.  10 years ago, this place would have been a 4.5 out of 5.  Its just good to see it still operational.  TIP:  Compare Cora's next door to Papa Ceo's.   Very similar pizzas but one place may have fresher pies just out of the oven."}
{"text":"I feel like whichever pizza joint you go to first is the pizza joint you stick to. That's the case for me. I love papa ceos. The pizza is really cheap considering how large the slice is (bigger than your face, really), the pizzas named after italian actors, the fact that it is located between dance cave and where I used to live and was open until 3AM, the TV in the back showing really random movies...I could go on and on."}
{"text":"I personally like Cora's much better. Although Papa Ceo's seem to have more selection, most of their pizza's aren't fresh (if you go late at night which is when I only seem to crave my need for pizza!). It is open late and has a TV to keep you entertained, but it's not as homey as Cora's.  Although I must say the staff is very friendly. I came in at around midnight one night and was given a free slice on top of the one I bought but only because the pizza's were going to be thrown out soon.  Either way, I'd check out the place next door before I settle here."}
{"text":"4.5* (half a star for the cheapness) .  better (much much muchhh x100000 better) than pizza pizza .   ive had my first ever slice(s) from papa ceo's yesterday . after studying for hours at the depressing gray concrete walled school library where EVERYONE look like they want to start crying, this was the best study break comfort food i could possibly get .  these are HUMONGO pizza slices EVER . one slice is a quarter of the whole pizza . for $4 flat, i got TWO slices (the fancier slices), which means i got HALF of the pizza for $4 . do they usually give you 2 slices when you order one slice ? or did they just give me an extra slice ? :)  i got mambo (i did, however, stand there for a while debating b/w robert deniro & mambo) & why havent i known that spinach is absolutely delicious on pizza ? why was yesterday my first time here, what took me so long even tho i pass by it pretty often ?   if you want cheap, huge, delicious pizza, go to papa ceo's . im craving for it as i type . i havent tried cora the next door yet so i need to go there next, but for next next time, i cant wait to come back & try the robert deniro or al pacino . or rambo . i dunno . maybe i'll get all 3 . :))"}
{"text":"This place gets two stars for the service from the guy making the pizza.  I should have walked out.  You know that saying, \"when there's no one inside a restaurant, that should give you an idea of the food...Don't go\"....  I don't know why people complain about pizza pizza.  I actually like their pizza and would rather get chips from the vending machine at the U of T athletic center instead of coming here.  You'll notice alot of the people that praise this place like the late hours after drinking.  Bad pizza + drunken stupor = good pizza ???  The slices are huge.  I've read some reviews here, people seem to like the sheer size of the slices.  It's $4 for a quarter of a pizza, not bad.    I've always been a quantity over quality but even I didn't like this place.  Had one of the fresh slices....magaretta but it didn't have any flavour.  I should have stuck with the cheese slice.  Tables were dirty, seats dirty.  The guy making pizza was serving money and didn't wash his hands.  We found a hair ...."}
{"text":"Worse Pizza company, I ordered a small order of 19.00 and they cancelled because some driver issue, this isnt the first time. The customer service here is so bad and the food isnt even that good. Waste of time."}
{"text":"This place is under new management and I can tell, the pizza has gotten way better the staff is pretty friendly. It appears that the manager of cora's now works there at papa ceo, and is an owner!, so we should expect very good pizzas."}
{"text":"Greasy spoon pizza that's huge enough for the hungry monster. $4 Slices are huge and loaded with toppings. Crust is nice and crisp. The only downside is they look like they have been sitting out for a few hours (I went in at 3pm). You can tell just by looking at the cheese. That said, they tossed it in the oven for 5 mins and it came out pipping hot and mighty tasty. (and extremely greasy might I also add even for the veggie version so don't go if you are counting calories)"}
{"text":"Well, this place has its up and downs. My favorite (and consistent choice) slice has always been the al pacino. That's ground beef, spinach and feta cheese. I measure the consistency by that slice.  last time i went, it tasted nothing like i remembered. i hope it was an off day and they didn't change something. It seems like the kind of joint where you could count on something being made exactly the same way forever."}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty OK - probably their biggest selling point is that they're open very late. It definitely looks like a place that's open late - tiny, cramped, and kind of grungy.  The pizza is pretty good, and they've got a good selection of toppings/varieties, even into the wee hours of the night. Like Pizzaiolo, you get the large double slice for $4, and they heat it up in the oven for you. If they get crowded (which actually happens sometimes at night) then you have to make sure to insist they put it back - their pizza is pretty good when it's hot, but it's downright nasty when you have to eat it cold."}
{"text":"Papa has recently retired and has remained to be a partner... The place is still called Papa Ceo. But its run by some other guys now.... Used to get extra slices for free! A classic U of T student favs."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst pizza i have ever ate. the pizza was completely flat and taste freezer burnt i suggest going to the other pizza store next store do not eat here 0 stars a complete waste of money."}
{"text":"The girlfriend and I were looking for a late night slice one night, walking home along Spadina, and we happened across Papa Ceo's.  Glad we did!  Even at the late hour the ambiance was casual and friendly, and we had great fun chatting up the man behind the counter.  The girlfriend is veggie, so she enjoyed the Tina Turner slice (!), and wouldn't have been more pleased if she was rolling on the river.  I needed something more manly, so I ordered up a Terminator, and all I could say was \"Hasta la pizza, baby!\"  The slices are big and bountiful, and only four bucks each!  We will surely be back."}
{"text":"Wow was I surprised. Delicious pizza at a delicious price. Pizza was a good size and filled me right up. When I walked in, everyone was all smiles. I highly recommend the Margherita pizza, tasted authentic and had me craving more, so I ordered an extra slice to take home. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"i use to live around there.  imho, ceo edges out cora's.  the margarita just tastes a bit more authentic to me."}
{"text":"WHEN the pizza is heated properly, it's not too bad. If you're hungry. At least, it's better than Cora Pizza, the next door competitor.  Problem being--they NEVER heat it long enough. Today I ran out of patience with the soggy crust, congealed cheese and lukewarm topping that this underheating produces. (I'm also pregnant, so wanted to make sure the deli meats on the slice were heated through properly.) So I asked the lady to put it back in the oven for me for a little while. (I was perfectly polite, btw.)  You would have thought I had just asked her if I could take a pee in their sink.  She was SO grudging and rude, shaking her head and mumbling under her breath. Seriously?!? Lady, if you are not prepared to meet a simple, easy request from a customer who doesn't want to get food poisoning from your tepid pizza, you should not be in the business. Go and do something in an industry where you don't ever have to interact with people.  Anyway, once they had put it back in the oven for 2 minutes longer, the pizza was fine. I don't know why they don't just do this in the first place. Is it because they think people are in such a rush they'd rather eat cold, soggy pizza than wait an extra 2 minutes? Or is it because they are trying to sling as many slices in as little time possible? Either way they should have a little more respect for their product, and their customer. I might give it one more try, but if I get the same cold pizza followed by a death stare again, no way Jose.  I think the place has such a high rating bc people are comparing it to Pizza Pizza, which is honest to god the worst, most overpriced pizza in the world. Seriously, saying that this is way better than Pizza Pizza is not saying much at all. If you think Papa Ceo's is the peak of pizza perfection, I feel sorry for you, my friend. It's greasy, cheap pizza--pretty satisfying when it's done right (or you're stoned off your chops), but that's it.  Also taking off a half star because they don't have hot sauce (at least the didn't today). Only thing that makes cold pizza palatable IMO."}
{"text":"I've never understood why Papa Ceo's usually plays second string to Cora's next door. For sure, Papa's has the better vegetarian selection, and even one cheeseless. Huge slices (about a quarter of a pizza) with legitimate toppings, although sometimes the crust on particularly old slices can be a mouthful. I even kind of like the atmosphere - friendly staff giving you free slices at 3:30 AM, faded photographs of drunk hungry people in Halloween costumes, usually a Rambo movie going on in the back, and all the slices are named after famous people. Inexplicably, Picasso is just Pavarotti with potatoes."}
{"text":"Large slices. Great for dinner or late night snack. Friendly staff. Apple Pay available. Always give you your pizza nice and warm."}
{"text":"Really loved the slice I had here. I had the Canadian slice which was perfect! Very nice man behind the counter and seating was adequate if you were to bring friends! Cora's next door was good too but not seating friendly"}
{"text":"+ friendly staff, open late -  poor taste, garlicy sauce  Went here on a Saturday night.  it's located in the University district, not the easiest to find.  It's open late which I guess is a bonus. Parking is hard to find on the street.  Upon entering, staff were very friendly, telling us which pizza came out of the oven recently.  Most of the slices looked like they had been sitting there for awhile.  We ordered a couple of freshly made slices ($4 each) which were the Canadian with bacon, mushrooms, and pepperoni.  Slices are pretty big in size.  They threw slices in he oven for 5 minutes.  Upon them coming out, I took a bite of one and was not impressed.  Crust was too crispy on the bottom (it's thin to begin with anyway).  All I could taste was garlic in the sauce--gross.  As if they just sprinkled cheap garlic powder in the sauce, it totally ruined the pizza.  Toppings didn't seem of any good quality and did not taste fresh.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Protip: if you're not sure what to try, get the margherita or the 4 cheese (not sure if that's what it's called - it has ricotta on it).  What to expect:   Dough that is New York thin, but delightfully crispy base thats resonates in your brain for days, weeks ahead.   Margherita is simple, unpretentious and cohesive mix of classic Italian flavours with nuances of garlic that keep you wanting for more.  Pizza that is up to par of bougie-r places with bougie-r prices. Do yourself a solid and grab a slice at this hidden Toronto gem.    Place is under new management that aim to please. Much friendlier and seems to care a lot more than previous owners, and is now family-run. Pizza chef has been there for 20+ years and lights up at pizza conversations (Think Jiro Dreams of Sushi, but pizza.)     Now I'm craving the margherita slice at Papa Ceo's. If only they deliver all the way to Brampton."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a gooey, cheesy thin slice of pizza this is the place. The atmosphere has a well worn authenticity about it that is charming. Bottom line. Super yummy by the slice pizza."}
{"text":"Their pizza is very undercooked and had barely any sauce. Was also not a fan of their dips."}
{"text":"Oh Papa Ceo!!!! You hold a dear place in my heart.   Harbord Village/Annex was my first real Toronto neighbourhood. I knew I had to choose a neighbourhood pizza joint for all my pie fixings. Papa Ceo was the chosen!  Why? What made Papa Ceo better than Pizza Gigi, Pizza Nova, Pizza Pizza, Pizzaiolo and Cora?   Where do I begin? Unique topping combination for their slices with great names! Best price for HUGE slices! Great quality of ingredients! Licensed! Also fair walk-in specials for a whole pizza! Open late, ALWAYS. Also, they were always so so so friendly!   One of the major reasons I miss my old hood is because I miss this delicious pizza!   Easily one of my favourite places for cheap pizza in the city!"}
