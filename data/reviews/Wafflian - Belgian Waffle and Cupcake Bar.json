{"text":"Service was amazingly slow.  Took us over 10 minutes to get one single crepe on a weekend...too bad we had to wait for 3!"}
{"text":"My girl & I had a hankering for waffles & decided to finally go & check out Wafflian!
Wafflian is a small secret waffle house hiding inside the 'Village by the Grange Mall'.  
This place smells great & our waffles were indeed satisfying.  
We ordered the Brussels style waffles; chocolate & regular with whipped cream.  Our waffles were very soft, fluffy & light as compared to other waffle places.  Other places tend to serve waffles that are a bit thick, doughy & heavy.  
Since these were light tasting, we stayed for coffee & a \"Vanilla Dream\" cupcake which was also very fluffy & light.  The coffee was very fresh & I can tell it was not sitting for long, went down smooth!  So we left with a smile, a waffle loyalty card, & hope to return again soon.  
...btw it's the perfect place to take your date especially on a Saturday afternoon!!"}
{"text":"I've now been to Wafflian several times (get their frequent customer Waffle card! 1 stamp for every waffle purchased) and have enjoyed it each trip.

I've had at least 4 kinds of cupcakes (double chocolate, green tea & cheesecake, peanut butter & banana, oreo cookie to name a few) tried both kinds of waffles, a snowflake and a coffee. 

Cupcakes = I am extremely picky about cupcakes, buttercream or bust kind of gal, and I greatly enjoyed all of the cupcakes. The cake is crumbly, moist, and the buttercream is wonderful. I especially loved the green tea and cheesecake one. I had read the cupcakes were not good, but perhaps a change has been made recently? 

Waffles = COME HERE FOR THE WAFFLES! Fantastic, small enough for a snack, with fresh whipped cream and fruit, yum. Liege and brussels, I can't pick a favorite. Made fresh for every order. Also excellent with ice cream on top. The fruit is always arranged beautifully, like artwork. Some places just slap their toppings on your dish but I can tell care is taken with each order. 

Snowflake = I was wary at first! Tried a red bean one, and really liked it! The condensed milk adds some sweetness, and the red bean paste adds another layer of sweet texture. Great for a hot weather drink.

Coffee = So-so coffee. 

Decor/Atmosphere = Very cute, bright interior with friendly employees. The lighting is especially cool. Always clean, lots of forks, napkins, etc. Employees seem genuinely pleased to serve you.

Bonus = $1 bottle of water! 

Overall = I wish this was closer to my place! I love coming here for a sweet, affordable snack. Can't emphasize enough, try those waffles! So good."}
{"text":"I had waffle with ice cream - Ok. Nothing special. I wish they have more variety of toppings like mango, green tea shaved ice cream, anko (red bean paste) etc something that ordinary place doesn't offer. Maybe I will bring my own topping next time lol

Cup cakes - Interesting selection of cup cakes. Flavor is good especially green tea one (I had green tea one and cookie and cream one). Problem is those cup cakes were seating there for a while so it was really hard and crunchy like brick. Cup cakes are in the glass display without proper cover so moisture is sucked in the dry air and make cup cakes very chewy.

If the cup cakes were soft and moist, then I would've really liked them.

This place has potential but has a lot of room to grow. I wish I can see this place year after year but for now, hardly likely"}
{"text":"Walked by and saw their big promotion poster outside and decided to give it a try.  Ordered the Bread Bowl Soup, turned out to be a total disappointment.  I know that I should not have expected much at $4.50, but this completely exceeded my expectation.  I am surprised they are even selling this to the customers when it is this bad .  The soup tasted like the those cheap canned ones, without even being heated; the bread was dry and tasteless.  The waffles and the ice-cream may be better, but I really don't think I will give them a try after the soup experience."}
{"text":"OH MY OH MY I LOOOOVVEE the sweet potato latte it is an all time favourite and the green tea cupcake  HEAVENLY GOOOOD , plus everything is so beautiful inside"}
{"text":"Hidden deep inside Village by the Grange, I never knew this place existed. Even when I ate at Manpuku several times.

Food & Presentation: My friend and I ordered a Brussels original waffle, topped with chocolate sauce and a scoop of vanilla ice cream, they also have the Brussels waffle made with chocolate but we didn't notice until later. After ordering and paying at the register, they went straight to making it with the waffle press. The toppings were added with care and thin waffle like cookies were added on to look like wings on the vanilla ice cream scoop. The waffle was soft, tasty and gobbled up in no time.

Atmosphere & Service: You can see the sample waffles laid out and they had a display of cupcakes behind a glass covering. The interior of the small shop was really welcoming and well thought out to match a cute theme. The staff/ owners greeted us warmly. The menu is laid out high behind the counter, easy to read. There is small tables for two and one side of the shop has individual seating. 

Pricing: The prices are okay, not the cheapest, not the most expensive. Items range from ~$3-$8.

May try next time: They had this item on the menu called the Snowflake, by the look of it, it sort of reminds me of the Korean treat pat bing soo. The way they make it is they have shaved ice in a cup with condensed milk, then top off with selected toppings such as strawberry slices, red bean etc, and then a scoop of ice cream on top. It costs I think $5.75 or somewhere along that range, it may look cheap to make, but it looked really pretty."}
{"text":"Nice decor and friendly staff, but I can't say I loved the cupcakes.  I went with a friend and we went halfsies on the red velvet and vanilla on vanilla.  I have a red velvet obsession and I have to say that this was probably the worst RV cupcake I've eaten in Toronto!  Both RV and vanilla were super dense, almost doughy if you will and hard.  The icing on the vanilla was way too sugary and almost seemed to be crystallized, like the icing wasn't mixed properly.
There aren't any other cupcake places in the neighbourhood, so I would maybe return out of sheer desperation for a cupcake fix BUT at $2.95 each I would probably just grab a donut or something....I would probably enjoy it more!

I would however return here to try a waffle...but I'm not in any rush to do so."}
{"text":"I was actually disappointed when I received my dessert. I had high expectations on my waffles as I really really love waffles.

I ordered $7 strawberry and banana ice cream waffle. The person made it in front of us and gave the dessert to me right after she finished making it. Instead of being put in a plate, the dessert was placed on a styrofoam light weighted plate. This surprised me and gave me a sense of not so good dessert. They also provide us with non reusable knifes and forks, also napkins.

For the food, the waffle were unexpectedly thin. There was barely a thick texture. I can hardly use my non reusable knife to cut the waffle into pieces. Ice cream and the fruits  were OK though. The price ($7) was not equivalent to the quality of the dessert. I would not come to the shop again; I would rather try out other better quality shops.

P.S The shop had no customers at 16.20 on a Thursday. 

The reason why I chose to eat at this waffle shop was that I saw their shop from Mankupu modern Japanese Eatery while having lunch. Therefore I just wanted to give it a try.

Service was OK.
Food choice: lots to choose from"}
{"text":"I seriously LOVE this place. For $2.50 you get a giant waffle with ice-cream. They have many flavors you can choose from, green tea, vanilla, chocolate... and the list goes on. They have also have lunch time specials you can get as well. I love coming here during my afternoon snack at work, it's close to my work and I seriously am here every other day getting my ice-cream waffle! 

They also serve mini cupcakes too, which are heaven tasting. LOVE! I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a little sweet treat for themselves."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a weekday. There was one Korean lady working. The service was very nice and swift. The food was fresh, warm and tasty. Great for the price! I only tasted two things and I'd love to come back to taste more!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! I tried both Belgian waffles, and they are awesome and delicious. Also the guy at the store seemed really nice."}
{"text":"My review of this place is a relatively short one and is only based on their cupcakes.

My sister and I ordered a few cupcakes, 2 of which were mine: the red velvet and cookies & cream. When I picked them up by hand I noticed immediately how hard they felt. They were also much smaller in size in comparison to other specialty cupcake shops I have been to in Toronto.

Red velvet: the food coloring in the cake was a very vibrant red and it almost looked cartoony. The texture of the cake itself was dense and I barely tasted any cocoa flavors in the cupcake. The cream cheese icing was light and a little gritty and also not very sweet. Overall it seemed as though they put more effort trying to color it red than actually put any flavor in the cupcake.

Cookies and cream: the cake was also very dense and dry, tasting almost day old. The icing was hard and tasted like a basic vanilla icing - nothing remarkable about it.

Overall the cupcakes were very average and the taste and appearance reminded me of grocery store cupcakes. They were not very impressive at all and definitely not worth $2.75 a piece. I expected more in terms of flavor and size for that price.

Although my first experience with the cupcakes was disappointing I have read decent reviews on their waffles and hope that those won't turn out to be as mediocre as their cupcakes."}
{"text":"I have been deceived! While in the Village by the Grange food court, I smelled the most delightful smell.... Tempting fresh waffles. I noticed the new business by the 'grand opening' sign and despite being full from lunch, I had a wander in. Now, it was the scent of waffles that lured me, and the name also suggests 'waffle place', but the cupcakes staring back at me in the display case won my heart. 

The display was nothing to be excited about... most flavors had one cupcake 'left' so I assumed it was because they've been selling out. I grabbed a strawberry banana cupcake, paid for the overpriced sweet treat, and was on my way. One bite into it, the greasy icing slid off the top and into my hand. While dealing with the mess that was spilling all over me, I was also dealing with the unpleasant taste in my mouth. Hard, dry, brick like cupcake with a flavour so artificial tasting it made my childhood memories of banana flavoured penicillin suddenly seem decadent. I can't go back. Not even to try the amazing smelling waffles. Sorry."}
{"text":"This place is okay, nothing special.

The menu was not very clear and the pictures seemed to be taken off of google; clearly not pictures of the actual items they serve. I ordered a strawberry waffle with strawberry ice cream but the small waffle we received also had bananas slices on it for some reason. So the waffle ended up having more bananas on it than strawberries. The person making our waffle was using a plastic knife to slice the strawberries, which seemed a bit odd (?).The ice cream scoop was also rather small. All in all the waffle was very tasty but not exactly worth the ~$8.

Most likely won't be returning, I'm sure you could get better waffles elsewhere for cheaper."}
{"text":"Best chai latte in Toronto! And the service is really top notch. The low reviews are unfair, this place deserves a much higher score by a mile. Yes the wait can be long but there is only one person working and she does the work of at least 3 people."}
{"text":"Though called wafflian their waffle desserts were nothing extraordinary. This is a cute little dessert shop located across from OCAD. Stopped by for dessert and got the original liege waffle with icecream (additional charge, I believe it was around ~$2). The waffle was not too sweet which I liked, but it was a bit dense. The ice cream we got on top of our waffle was chocolate and it tasted fine - everything was just okay, nothing special or mind blowing. My friend got a chocolate milkshake which I had a bit of and enjoyed more than the waffle. Overall I thought the food was okay. Other desserts on the menu were items like shaved ice and cupcakes - I would come back to try these items, but would not come back for the liege waffle."}
{"text":"It's a sad, sad day for the Village By the Grange food court. 

Actually-that's a lie. The only thing that is in peril following the opening of Wafflian today is my waistline. It's a brand new Belgian waffle and cupcake bar in the surprisingly good VBTG food court. I sometimes think I've developed some sort of sugar spidey sense-I actually managed to stumble upon this place on the opening day. My peripheral vision can miss doorways, people, cars etc but managed to spot the sign that promised waffles and cupcakes.

It was pretty busy for the first day and they apologised that they were still in test mode-only cash payments today and they'd run out of some cupcakes. The people serving were friendly though and the space is bright and sparkly. They had some waffle samples out which were tasty. I decided to get my usual \"test\" cupcake for cupcakeries from them-a red velvet. I'm so often disappointed by the offerings. I wasn't today! It was light, sweet and tasty with a perfect ratio of bun to frosting. And at $3.33 after tax it won't completely bankrupt you. Other varieties I spotted included chocolate peanut butter, banana peanut butter, green tea, chocolate, vanilla.... 

So-it's pretty much the worst thing that could have happened in my neighbourhood. A place that serves yummy cupcakes in close proximity to me. And with the aroma of fresh waffles. I'm doomed."}
{"text":"Wow. Ive been in the Grange so many times and I never had any interest in checking out this place. Boy was I so wrong. My coworker grabbed a shaved ice green tea dessert and holy crap, it was good. 

He got the medium size which was large enough to share and the flavours were just amazing. I cannot attest to how authentic this was but it was still a tasty dessert. I also haven't tried any of their other desserts and probably won't because I already found a great thing. 

The shaved ice had a sweet flavour throughout, had plenty of matcha powder, whipped cream, red bean, green tea ice cream, and sprinkled with a bit of almond slivers for just the smallest bit of crunch. 

Having worked in a nearby building for several years, I am so mad at myself for not coming here sooner. I shamelessly ate more than half of my coworkers dessert and I have no regrets."}
{"text":"After I've tried Toronto's cupcakes here, i always come out of other cupcakes shops wanting something like Wafflian's. 

The texture of the cupcakes here are the Least greasy and flaky. Incredibly moist and rich. Buttercreams are so fluffy and light, I haven't even felt it in my mouth. The chocolate flavour is the BEST in Toronto, can't even start to describe the richness of the coco. 

I seriously endure the bone-cracking coldness every evening to walk to the foodcourt to get the best cupcake in the world. Go Wafflian!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Although I do see some space for improvements but its great! 
I was actually at the Grange for quick lunch at Mean Bao, and saw the sign for waffles! I had to go back to work because of tight schedule, but came back for dinner.
Itwas pretty quiet when I was there. I grabbed chocolate coconut cupcake and Liege waffle with green tea ice cream.

1. Cupcake. : I was actually surprised to see so many bad reviews of the cupcakes. Mine was totally awesome.
Cake was moist with cocoa flavor and coconut icing had rich and just right amount of sweet flavor! 

2. Liege waffle: waffle it self has crisp slightly sweet crust and soft chewy inner dough. I'm so used to eating really sweet Liege waffles, so I would ask them to add more sugar next time, but with my icecream, I think it was just right :) 

I would love to try their frozen desserts next time!"}
{"text":"Got the leige waffle. It was premade and sitting in the tray. It was heated up in the waffle maker. I expected it to be fresh. I don't think that's too much to ask for an almost 4$ waffle. 
There was no sugar topping. Not even powdered sugar. I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"The store looked so pretty and so did their cupcakes. I ordered a red velvet and a green tea cupcake. I thought that no place could possibly have a bad red velvet cupcake but my god both cupcakes were awful. I actually didn't even finish them (tossed half of them out because it was so bad). They were dry and not very pleasing tasting. Also they weren't even soft like normal cupcakes. Don't waste your money going there!"}
{"text":"I'm shocked to see how bad the rating here is. Either they have made adjustments or I just had a really good experience with them. I got their green tea cupcake and their Belgian waffel dipped in chocolate with a scoop of ice cream (fatty, yes i know!). I was not too pleased with the green tea cupcake, not to say it wasn't good but it wasn't the best. The green tea flavor was not as strong as I hoped and I am not sure if cream cheese frosting is the right frosting to be paired with that.

Now for the main item, the Belgian waffel! I thought it was fantastic! It was fluffy, thick, soft, flavorful and fresh! I could notice the difference in texture between a belgian waffel and an \"american\" waffel within the first two bites. I also believe they were reasonably priced. We were informed that all their ingredients were imported and all made from Belgian. Definitely a place to try out and get that sweet tooth fix!"}
{"text":"Great shaved ice. A true hidden gem at the village by the grange. I thought they only had waffles and cupcakes (judging by their name) but I was surprised to find out they also had shaved ice! They serve korean style shaved ice (different from taiwanese). The ice itself is milk flavored, and you have about 5-6 flavours including the classic soybean flavored and matcha. We ordered a large matcha one that came to about $11. It was quite large for 2 people and we were full after finishing that, so I would recommend the smaller one. There was a healthy amount of matcha powder sprinkled on top of the shaved ice, along with some red beans, whipped cream and a scoop of matcha ice cream on top. The bf was very pleased with this shaved ice, saying the flavors were great. It didn't melt very fast which was great since I'm a slower eater. The ice is very finely shaved and it looked like snow. I'm always around this area but have never stepped into this place for dessert so I'll be sure to come and try the other flavors next time!"}
