{"text":"What a great find at the Intergalactic Art Car festival.

I had the meatballs and my husband had the roast beef.  Prices and portions were on par.  The service was good and the food was excellent.  The sauce for the meatballs was hearty yet a little tangy.  

I will definitely be on the lookout for A Family Secret at future events."}

{"text":"Stopped into the food truck court this evening. Everything was closing up and owner of A Family Secret offered me and my wife a meatball parm sandwich! This was amazing!
Fresh meatballs and I think he had a garlic butter on the bread. Dude was very nice and whipped it up fast and we also had his watermelon water, so refreshing. 

Will be back!!"}
