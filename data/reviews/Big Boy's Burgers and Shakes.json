{"text":"I haven't had a Big Boy Burger for maybe 20 years. My guess... it'll be another 20.

It wasn't bad! ...it just wasn't good. Quality is a step above McDonald's. All of our burgers were burned. Buns were nice, I liked topping options. Fries were very good (probably a cross between the natural cut of Five Guys and the thinness of Steak n Shake). Price isn't bad. 

Shakes were a total disappointment. I feel like we could have taken a bottle of Hershey's Syrup, cheap vanilla ice cream and a little milk and we'd have the same thing at home. There really is nothing special about the shakes.

Staff was very friendly, service was quick, dining room was clean and well kept. There isn't a ton of seating. This is Chipotle style ordering (what kind of dish are you getting, then go down the line adding toppings, etc...)

Even though we won't be getting another one, the shake/dessert station is separate so if you aren't ordering food, you can just order dessert and pay there.

Nice idea, but not impressive food. Would rather go to Five Guys for about the same price literally across the street."}
{"text":"The burger was Ok. I seemed to remember that the sauce was creamier. The milkshake was thin and watery. I'll probably wait awhile and try it again after they are open longer."}
{"text":"They offer a vegan burger that sounds great! Unfortunately they cook the vegan burgers on the very greasy grill next to the meat patties. What is the point of this? They will not cook the burger separate. Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"I will preface this by saying I did not get a burger, fries, or shake. I got a chicken salad. It was very good. Cooked fresh and made right in front of me with the toppings I wanted-- always love that. This place is set up like a Chipolte/Five Guys hybrid. You wait in line, pick out your bread, pick your meat, your toppings, and your sides. Like Five Guys, all sides are separate cost. They have included fresh cut fries but also expanded sides to salads and coleslaw. They also have a separate area that is an ice cream shop where you can get sundaes, milkshakes, and ice cream cones.

When you first walk in, you will get greeted and ask if you would like a milkshake. I think this is so they can have a chance to have your milkshake ready at the same time as your burger-- which I think is great. The cooks behind the counter were really nice, personable, and fun. I ordered a marinated chicken wedge salad. My chicken did take a few minutes to complete, but this is because they cook all the chicken fresh.. which is hard to complain about. The cashier was very pleasant. When I got back to work and ate my salad it was pretty good. It wasn't amazing or anything, but the chicken was well seasoned and all veggies were fresh and crisp. I hope to go back and try more signature items soon."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for a birthday lunch. Laid back atmosphere. You go up and order your meal. It's mostly assemble your burger with that you want on it. These aren't gourmet burgers, but just really good old fashioned ones. The veggie patty they make is delicious and they also offer a gluten free bun. The fries are very fresh and their milkshakes are awesome. If you are looking for a laid back burger and shake place, this is an excellent option."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here 2x since the Grand Opening on Tuesday.  The Original 1936 Big Boy is phenomenal.  Wife got the Super Big Boy on Tuesday.  The Fries are great.  Its a neat concept.  You can make your own burger, get the Original Big Boy, get a shake, sundaes, coffee.

The management seems very helpful, friendly, and very concerned that everything is enjoyable."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at the new Mayfield location today & were not disappointed! You now order and pay at the counter and grab a seat. They have many new, modern additions but we stuck with the original Big Boy and the hand cut fries. The burger was great and cooked to order, fries were excellent and of course the Big Boy sauce made the whole meal. The service was good and we met a few of the employees who were super friendly. My husband even got a shake on the house which was phenomenal! Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. Every time I have dined here every employee I have encountered has been over the top friendly and helpful. As one employee cleaned the trash and dining room he stopped to ask how everything was. Then as we left an employee who was on his break made it a point to say have a great day. Customer service these days is not always what it should be so it is extremely refreshing to see it's a priority here. Please pass along my appreciation to everyone there."}
{"text":"I was weaned on Big Boy Burgers, and growing up in Cleveland in the fifties there were no shortages of places to get one
     Alas as we moved closer to the new millennium the franchises declined.This is why I am happy the Som Center location opened. The food is terrific, the milk shakes divine. The French fries are great and the portions huge.
     The staff is friendly and the place is clean."}
{"text":"Pay attention  to the menu - the french fries are just a buck less than the amazing Big Boy.  I thought the fries were \"MEH\".  Next time, I'll be gettin - 2 of the amazing BB's instead of the very \"meh\" fries.  It's a fast moving order then pay to pick up kinda place.  The BB sauce is on the table - if you ate on the fly - I don't know if you would get enough sauce.  Very clean and efficient - .  The wedge salad was surprisingly - wonderful. 

Absolutely the worst signage EVER - It takes one reading through half their meal to figure out what would have been best to order."}
{"text":"Biggest disappointment was lack of ONION RINGS.  My first job in 1961 was assistant manager for Manner's Big Boy.  We had the best damn O-Rings in town.  I first worked at the old Manner's on Euclid Ave just east of  Ivanhoe Rd., then in Woodmere where Eaton Collection is now.   I fondly remember the car-hops."}
{"text":"It takes one Big Boy to beat Five Guys! This is by far the best burger in Ohio!!! If I would have known, I'd be getting lunch here on the regular.  You have to try the frozen lemonade. It tastes like Italian ice mixed with fresh squeezed lemonade. It was the perfect way to wash down this delicious cheeseburger."}
{"text":"No, just no. Disorganized, a little on the dirty side, we didn't get what we ordered, they overcharged us, and I could go on. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Friendliest staff! Johnny's bacon cheddar was amazing. Big Boys were pretty good also. Regular order of fries is really big enough for two. Everyone enjoyed their quick lunch. A new favorite."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a burger guy, but this place REALLY makes me reconsider. 

The \"Big Boy\" name has always been associated with a variety of foods in my memory, but, per history, the little guy with the big burger has always been associated with just that; big burgers. 

This new \"Big Boy\" line serves just that, with an extra helping of good service combined with a side of fries and some LEGENDARY shakes. We had a really nice time there, the people were friendly and made us feel special. The food was good, tasty and my wife had a shake that was, to say the least, perfect. The seating is decent and th

I think the only thing the place lacks is abundant parking, as it is in a strip with more shops, but overall, a great experience; it's where all the Big Boys (and Girls) should go for a fun night out:)"}
{"text":"Big Boy sandwich a little smaller than other Big Boy Restaurants, but it was very good and having Big Boy sauce on every table was really nice, fries were very good and service was very good, not really thrilled to stand in line and order instead of  having service at table, but long line moved very fast. All in all it is nice to have a Big Boy so close instead of driving out to Valley View. We will be returning often I am sure."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. I would't give the food a 5 (more like a 4) but the total experience was so pleasing that I give them a 5. 

Upon walking in I was greeted immediately and explained how things work. The staff was very happy and helpful. Great customer care! I would say the ordering process is similar to a five guys. 

The burger was really good (created my own) my only complaint was that there was more bun than burger so when I finished I still had bread left. I hate it when that happens but the taste was great. 

I ordered a regular fry and it was HUGE. The fries were more of the shoestring type. Very hot and not too salty. 

Lastly, I ordered a death by chocolate shake. It looks like they use really ice cream to make them. It was thick and chocolaty and left me wanting more."}
{"text":"Service was ehh... The milkshake lady as you first walk in had an attitude and I was thrown off by the way she was treating the customers. Her attitude was not nice. The cooks were fun and very polite when they asked for your order.
You wait in line as if you were at chipotle! I got two super big boy with fries for takeout. The wait was about ten minutes and I started from the door entrance. They had a tons of people working so I think that helped smooth the process. I didn't see anyone working in the dining room while I ask there... I was there around 6:00pm this Saturday evening. 


Overall- I enjoyed my burger very much! The fries were good but the bag was half full... I felt they could give me more or there just overpriced? Besides that, I will be back in the future but I think there gonna have big competition with Five Guys being so close..."}
{"text":"I was at Bob's last night. Originally we were going to eat in but the line and the wait time made it easier to take out. The original \" big boy\" was ok. Warm- not hot. The fries were just bad- cold, over done, limp. Chicken sandwich was ok- and i liked the berry slaw. ALL cooked food was way over salted!! The chocolate shake was fair- the malt bad.  I paid close to $30 for this meal. Not worth it. I have fond memories of Bob's Big Boy. Of fried mushrooms and strawberry pie. This is a burger, salad, ice cream joint. Period. I was SO disappointed. It will get a pass in future. The burger was not $7 worth of ok."}
{"text":"The food is just ok but the whole ordering process is convoluted and confusing. There are multiple stations you order at one then pay at another. The menu is a graphic design nightmare. It's also extremely slow no one was in front of us and our order took a long time."}
{"text":"The customer service here is fantastic. We came in with our infant and before we could even look for a high chair, someone brought one over to us. The food is delicious! Hubby had the cheeseburger. I had chicken tenders and fries. I would definitely recommend trying this place. The service is fast and friendly and the food is yummy."}
{"text":"Amazing experience for fans of the Big Boy. This isn't a Frische's experience or Big Boy you remember. No salad bar, old booths, or Brawny Lads. One thing I tried was a Big Boy sandwich and it was amazing. Possibly the best I've ever had. For that crave ability and subsequent satisfaction, they get 5 stars. I find myself pining for it. I've maybe got burger issues. They might have good french fries and milk shakes to support this excellence, but for me this is the place to experience a double decker cheeseburger with shredded lettuce and tartar sauce. They found a quality secret. I think it was 1936."}
{"text":"The service was great, the food was OK. I ordered a big boy and it tasted just like I was back in time eating at the old bobs big boy on chagrin Blvd. In Woodmere. I will go back just because I like the big boy burger but if you've never had it and don't know what to expect don't go in here thinking your going to get an awesome  burger."}
{"text":"This was a pick up order, so i didn't expect too much. The fries were a cold and wilted. didnt eat them. I'm not of fan of skinny fries anyway. The burger was OK, a little too salty and nothing special. wont rush back."}
{"text":"Good old Big Boy's. This new location seems to be a reformulated version of the old sit down restaurant. Think Five guy-ish. You order your food and walk along the line to the register and pay.  Grab your food after its prepared and sit down.  There's a separate station to order milk shakes from. I skipped the shake this visit. 

I went for the classic double and some fries. Something about the classic with patties cooked on a flat top. This was a well put together burger with mayo and relish.  Fries were hot and fresh.  At the table they offer a variety of seasonings and condiments. Flavor up things to your taste. 

My burger was wrapped a little tight causing the bun to be smashed but I overlooked it because it still was tasty. I'll come back here again soon."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place because five guys is so greasy....I am super, super impressed with the quality of the food as well as the cleanliness and friendliness of the staff.
As soon as we entered, we were happily greeted...we were the only people in line.  Their menu is smaller but has a great selection, which includes: veggie burger, gluten free, grilled chicken, salads and a nice children's menu.  I chose the cheeseburger \"fully loaded\", which just means all the condiments, lettuce, tomatoes, onions.  My spouse ordered the big boy, but didn't get any toppings because he thought it came with it all but you have to specify.  We both got fries.  Our seven year old ordered the peanut butter, banana and honey grilled sandwich, applesauce, and a kid chocolate milkshake.

Everything was fantastic; the meat was cooked well and was high quality, the veggies were really crisp and fresh.  The fries are more shoestring and I love them this way.  The shake was light and frothy and perfect.  

This place, in my opinion, is much better than Five Guys across the street and the prices are a lot better here.  The dining room is spacious and very clean and the staff looked like they liked their jobs.  Great place to take the family, for sure!"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. Very hectic atmosphere, and the menu is extremely confusing. The employees seemed confused and they would leave in the middle of making your burger to do something else, while you were talking to them. The dining area was filthy nothing was clean, the drink machine was leaking everywhere. When we finally sat down to eat our food it was sitting in a pool of grease and the bun completely dissolved, making it impossible to lift up or eat. The French fries were extremely salty. The food was way over priced, you would be much better off going to the Five Guys across the street for some actual food."}
{"text":"dark chocolate shake will change your life. (Commenting on the shake only...that's all I get here)"}
{"text":"Actually wish they would allow 1/2 stars, I would bump up to 3 1/2. Service good, very friendly. Food...I had a big boy. It is as you remember. If you liked it then, you'll like it now.  Hubby had Ohio burger with a fried egg on top. He said it also was very good. Shared a large fry....small would have been enough to share, but honestly fries were low point of meal, just meh.  Shakes seem to be a big part of their business model. We did not partake, but people who had shakes seemed satisfied.  Place was clean enough, but floor was sticky. You know that sound and feel sneakers get on a sucky floor?  Yup, drives me crazy. 
Be mindful though that this is not a sit at a table and order place.  If you just walked in and didn't look at menu board too closely you would think you were in five guys."}
{"text":"2nd time is a charm. Wasnt impressed my first visit but decided to give it another chance and everything was better this.
French fries are hot, fresh, and crispy!! Lemonade is just ok, didnt wanna try the Blueberry Lemonade (maybe next time...lol).
Burgers are made to order and it was quite good.
4 Stars because they used too much salt on the fries....."}
{"text":"Outstanding service, great food, kids eat for free on Saturday! Dine in service and atmosphere is welcoming for all to enjoy."}
{"text":"Employee cook is stoned and/or drinking. Smells like smoke. Cashier is confused. The whole darn place is a slow moving train to disaster! Aaaah!!!"}
{"text":"Big ups to these guys for bringing back  the burger that I grew up with! Ordered a signature burger with fries and shake...got to punch the red button for  doing so too! For sure the shake and the burger was definitely on point; I deducted a star for the fries which were plentiful but a little on the raw side for my taste."}
{"text":"Amazing food and shakes, but even better customer service! They fed our entire hockey team just before closing with smiles and laughs. Huge shout out to the entire staff who worked tonight and helped out the OJL hockey team!"}
