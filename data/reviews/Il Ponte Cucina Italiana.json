{"text":"Giancarlo - the owner, host - is extremely inviting and gracious.  He and the entire staff were very hospitable to us and the other guests during our dinner. Everyone was made to feel welcome.  The food is some of the best that I have tasted and also in its visual presentation. I had the Vitello Toscana - 6 out or 5 stars! - and my date had the Cornish hen which was also phenomenal. There is also a great selection of wines to choose from, as well as nice and well selected array of deserts.  The highlight of the night is that we felt like guests - not customers to be served and be done with.  We were able to take our time, enjoy the dinner and each other's company and the atmosphere of the restaurant.  It was the first time but definitely not the last time we will go there."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this resto to open for a while now since it's just down the street from our house and it's menu of Italian staples is a welcome addition to the neighbourhood, a cuisine missing in this area of Riverside.   We went late on a Saturday and the only diners left in the just-opened restaurant were on their way out. The owner consulted his staff and they decided to keep it open just for us, saying they were more than happy to, but with one caveat--that we'd be confined to the pizzas and salad offerings. That was a-ok and we split two salads and three pizzas between four people, as well as a decent bottle of wine for grand total of around $140, or a reasonable $35 per person.   The salads were great portion sizes and very well presented and flavourful...we had the Rucola($14) with arugula and fig and the Finochio with fennel, orange and a lovely chill dressing.Both were great.   The pizzas were of the Neopolitan type and the staff were very interested in our opinion of them. We had the rapini and sausage ($16), the Ponte ($18)with figs, gorgonzola and proscuitto and the Amico ($15)--a sort of classic pie with pepperoni and peppers. The combos were all great, if sort of standard, and the crust was a great take on that thin, chewy texture that is so trendy right now --- a great start for a new resto where the staff themselves said they were experimenting and super open to feedback about the food--which was great!   The only thing I would say is they weren't as blistered as some others I've had, but that might have something to do with the fact that the ovens were cold as they were packing up to go home when we came in--so can't fault them there!  Also, they came with a great and spicy chili dipping oil so be sure to ask for that!  Overall, it was such a unique and hospitable dining experience. The restaurant is beautiful--- (all fancy marble it seemed like) and you could NOT ASK for better service. It was a real authentic Italian restaurant! I really hope this little gem makes it in this hood and can't wait to see it start filling up with customers! Here's a link to the menu: http://ilponte.ca/?page_id=12"}
{"text":"We have been meaning to try Il Ponte since it opened not long ago, and finally got the chance to sit down for a proper meal last weekend. It was a busy Saturday night, definitely prime time, and we were excited.   The decor is understated and elegant. Definitely not trying too hard - very contemporary and modern for an Italian restaurant, but not stuffy in the least.   The host and owner/manager(?) as well as the other staff were very welcoming. We were given a window seat for two, which was perfect.   Appetizers: fried calamari was a winner. Perfectly breaded and fried, easily the best we've had in the city. We've tried calamari at every restaurant that offers it on the menu, and we're picky about quality. This was exactly as we like it - thick rings, lightly breaded and salted, fried perfectly, and hot! We balanced this out with some buffalo mozzarella/tomato and arugula salad, which was fine but basic.   Mains: we ordered the steak special of the night, a superb ribeye that was cooked perfectly medium. It was buttery and melted in your mouth. We also ordered the veal medallions, which were stuffed with cheese and prosciutto, and came in a tomato and pine nut sauce. The sauce detracted from the flavor of the veal medallions, unfortunately. Personally I'd prefer them grilled/seared and without the sauce. However, if you like tomato sauce, definitely something to try.   The service was decent, although at times we felt a bit neglected as there were many larger parties dining and in need of attention.    In all, we are definitely going to return and try other dishes. There was a lot of fish on the menu, and we love fish!   We will definitely be back soon :)"}
{"text":"I had dinner at Il Ponte yesterday (August 22nd), and while I'm generally reluctant to give any restaurant a bad review, our my meal was pretty gross. The sauce that our mussels came in tasted like dishwater, the calamari in my girlfriend's pasta was tougher than rubber bands and the pizza had so much uncooked flour on it that I had to literally wipe each piece with my napkin before eating it. That said, once the disgusting flour was scraped off, the pizza was quite delicious. There seems to be a loyal group of regulars who the waiters chat with at your expense. I wouldn't go back or ever recommend this place."}
{"text":"I feel moved to write a review of Il Ponte, because as great as the food was (and it is wonderful), the service is excellent. Staff were attentive, patient, and extremely friendly to our large party, including 3 young kids. We couldn't have chosen a better spot for dinner."}
{"text":"Great dinner! I just had dinner here with my daughter and best friend. We had the calamari to start and the burrata. Both were splendid! My friend had the grilled salmon and I had the grilled lamb chops. The lamb was perfectly seasoned and grilled --I could probably have eaten more if it was in front of me. The proportions were perfect.   My daughter (3 years old) had a margherita pizza and she enjoyed it too. I will be devouring her leftovers for lunch at work tomorrow.   The bread the offered for starters was also not your run of the mill bread -- olive bread and crusty Italian bread was on the tray along with the most delicious olives that was also devoured by my daughter.   A pleasant surprise this little gem of a restaurant! I'm so glad we came in!"}
{"text":"Earlier this week, I noticed this place on my way to work in the morning and decided to give it a shot. Good decision!  Upon arrival to the restaurant we were greeted by two very welcoming guys and quickly shown to our table. We were informed of the specials and quickly made our decisions on our meals.  For a starter, we ordered the Caesar Salad and calamari. The salad was made with crisp romaine, croutons, a house made dressing (deliciously creamy) and shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano. The calamari was just as others describe it: fresh, melt-in-your-mouth, and perfectly breaded.  For our mains, I had the fish special - ahí tuna served with grilled market veg seared to perfect (and a larger portion, too) - and my partner had the seafood linguine. House made pasta. Very tasty tomato sauce and loads of fresh seafood.  To finish, we shared a tiramisu that was divine! The perfect finish to a wonderful meal.   Throughout the entire meal, the service was impeccable. Rarely do you see the restaurant owner, let alone the servers, coming around to see how everything is. Many restaurants in this city should take note!  Until next time..."}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere were great, but unfortunately the food requires improvement. Cornish hen and whole fish lacked flavour. Pizza was tough/chewy. Pasta was okay. Appetizers of mushrooms and seafood were good, however."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here yesterday with my wife and mom. Matt, our server, was wonderful and attentive. I had the osso buco with saffron rice, terrific. My wife had a pizza with gorgonzola that she really liked and my mom had the veal chop with vegetables which she really enjoyed. We'd had salads to start and coffee and tea to finish. The portions were generous so, despite being very tempted, we unfortunately didn't have the opportunity to try the desserts. Matt did bring along some great little biscotti though! A perfect end to the meal. We hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Totally basic Italian food with good service when you're spoken to. Ordered the scallop pasta and was promised the biggest and \"best scallops you can get in Canada\". Literally got 1.5 scallops in the dish (they are cut in half). Not even that tasty! Crème brûlée was great. Calamari is definitely overhyped on here."}
{"text":"Delicious food and awesome service! Elegant and modern the setting is. The energy in the place is cool and fun. If we come to Toronto again, we will be back  to Il Ponte Special thanks to the manager and server (am sorry I forgot to get their names). Try their calamari and house made pasta. 02/09/2017."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here, will definitely go back. Service was great, we were in no rush and enjoyed having the opportunity to have a leisurely dinner with friends. That seems to be the kind of service they provide so it meshed well.  Atmosphere is upscale casual, nicely decorated place with a modern but cozy feel. Biggest plus was that it was such a nice temperature in the restaurant, I hate walking into an ice box and freezing for the duration of the meal, using the napkin like a blanket...  Our waiter was enthusiastic, good humoured and did a good job helping us decide what we wanted, or at least validating that it was a good choice.  They gave us some bread and olives to get us going which were very tasty. We ordered the muscles to start, I drank the remaining broth like soup, it was so good (they give you spoons for this, some restaurants don't).   Also had the rabbit ragu (YUM), swordfish (wonderfully tender), the seafood pasta (really good) and the sterling. The meat was underdone for my husband's liking (rare) and they happily took it back and gave it a bit more time on the grill - it came back a perfect medium rare.   The wine was a bit pricy if you are familiar with how much the bottles are at the LCBO but that's typical at restaurants. We bought two bottles at $40 ea. For the whole meal, including two bottles of wine it came out to about $260 before tip."}
{"text":"I ordered a Mojito.  The waiter disappeared.  My drink arrived 35 minutes later courtesy of whom I'm assuming was the owner.  The drink had too much ice and no mint.  It tasted like a mix.  Thus began an evening of very poor service, inattentiveness, long waits between courses, no wine offerings with dinner etc, etc..  and the restaurant was not even busy!!  I encounter this frequently when I dine alone.  It really is inexcusable.  A shame really because the food is ok.  This bridge, unfortunately, is over troubled waters."}
{"text":"We expected a lovely meal after reading reviews and hearing good things through word of mouth, but ended up being disappointed. It wasn't busy the night we went and there seemed to be multiple people serving but the service was incredibly slow. Not just relaxed, but painfully slow. Maybe it was because we were all women, we weren't given the same attention, I don't know but one man, who may be the manager/owner, spent much of the evening standing chatting with one table of customers, while ignoring everyone else.   The time between courses was way too long. And we had to finally ask for our bill after waiting a good fifteen minutes after finishing coffee and dessert and having our plates removed.  The food would have been good, I imagine, if it had come out hot but each of us had the same complaint of warm on the outside, cold on the inside meals. For what they're charging, this is simply unacceptable and as someone who eats out minimum twice a week, with so many other good options in the city, it isn't likely that I will return."}
{"text":"I appreciated the décor especially the large photo of the bridge at the back of the restaurant to echo the actual bridge just outside the front door. They were quite busy and rushing to accommodate all customers. Being in our late 30s, it's safe to say we were the youngest in the crowd. My husband ordered the seafood pasta which he enjoyed.  However, as suggested by our server, I ordered something that wasn't on the menu - happily I was in the mood for gnocchi and was glad they had some and was prompted it be served with the Bolognese sauce.  This meal was very disappointing. The sauce was bland, tasteless and perhaps something my 3 year old would enjoy - But even he would complain as the sauce I can execute at home is ten times better.  I regretted my decision but couldn't imagine it tasting any better if it was served on other pasta that was in fact on the menu. Perhaps my face showed that I didn't enjoy my meal as our server didn't visit our table much after that."}
{"text":"We went here for a birthday dinner and everyone regretted it. The staff here are incredibly rude, the food lacked flavour, a few people did not even get their dishes ordered and they were pretty much forcing us to eat and get out asap. I've been to many Italian restaurants but this was probably the worst service ever. We felt extremely uncomfortable the entire time.  Do yourself a favour and avoid this place. You will be disappointed in every way."}
{"text":"I was brought here to celebrate my birthday with my boyfriend.   Kori was our server and he was amazing. from his attention to detail and his knowledge with wines, I was impressed with him from the time we sat down.   he was patient with me while I sorted though MANY wine options they had and I picked this subtle red.  app: mussels  main: mushroom pasta and pizza.  I give the restaurant 4 stars for the awesome service, the food was okay, nothing out of the ordinary.   not a place I'd rush back too."}
{"text":"Have been here on many occasions.  Having grown up in the area I've seen it develop over the years and Il Ponte has been one of the best additions to the neighbourhood thus far.  Giancarlo is a true gentleman and host and takes great pride in his restaurant.  Not once has service been an issue at this establishment.  I recommend the calamari and pizza (the Bell-O is my fav) to start.  The pastas are always made fresh and the wild boar ragu is to die for.  For desert you can't go wrong with the panna cotta and tiramisu.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We started with an arugula salad with fresh figs. Then on to orgasmic scallops in a Gorgonzola sauce over light little pillows of gnocchi , followed by tiramisu as light as air.  One of the best meals I have had. The service was great and the atmosphere was delightful. Go and enjoy  Even better the second time, The veal chop was unbelievable."}
{"text":"So I've been waiting a long time for this place to open. 15 months to be exact, and it was worth the wait. The decor is beautiful and a nice attention to detail. I'm giving these guys 5 stars right off the bat simply for the outstanding friendly service. You feel welcomed and at home from the minute you walk in this place. The waiters and owners greet you, ask your name, shake your hand and generally make you feel like they really appreciate your business. That alone will keep me coming back as a regular and just what this area needs.   Now on to the food and drink. We ordered a bottle of wine, that was very reasonably priced and was great. (Sorry forget the name).  And started with the Calamari which was perfect and I highly recommend. (Slightly too large a portion, which we couldn't finish and if we had might not been able to eat anything more. But new places are still working on portion sizing so this is expected.)  For the main we shared the whole sea bream as we were not super hungry. The owner brought it out and served it to us table-side carefully separating the delicious fish from the bone. It was cooked to perfection and served with some veggies.  We didn't care much for the greens that came with, I believe bok choy. But the olives were very nice. I wouldn't have liked a starch of some kind like rice with it. For desert we had the tiramisu which was lovely. Overall I would give 4 stars to the food, and 6 stars for the service! Well done guys and welcome to Riverside. I will be back again very soon!"}
{"text":"Noticed this place opened near the office, so popped in for dinner Friday night with the wife.  Soon after we sat down, a plate of cicchetti came for us to snack on while we go through the menu, which was a very nice touch.  We shared a plate of Arancini with Gorgonzola sauce to start as well. Flavour wise, it was very good, but my wife's was luke warm, mine was cold in the centre.    My wife ordered the Pizza Al Mare, and I ordered the Tagliatelle Bolognese.   The pizza was quite good, tomato sauce tasted very fresh, dough with crunchy and tasty.  The pizza was topped with shrimp, mussels, and clams, all were fresh. Eating it can be a bit of work though, cause the shellfish came with the shells, but we didn't mind.  My tagliatelle was again very good, the pasta was freshly house made, the sauce was flavourful, and the portion size was actually bigger than I expected.  The only complain was again the serving temperature was a bit on the cooler than it should have been.  For dessert, we were going to order the Tiramisu, but the waiter gave it to us as a complementary dessert before we had a chance to.  It was a much appreciated gesture cause the Tiramisu turned out to be the highlight of the night.  House made, creamy, flavourful, and not too sweet.  It was so good that my wife said she'd come here just for the tiramisu.  Overall, a pleasant experience and a good dinner.  Service was good, the waiters are friendly if busy.  I hope they get the serving temp of their food up though, might just be because they are working out some kinks since they are newly opened.  Will visit again for sure, especially since they are so close to the office. :)"}
{"text":"Finally made it here and so glad I did!  Excellent food.  Fresh, delicious and homemade.  The wine selection is very lovingly curated.  I spied this sardines toast and when I asked about it they immediately offered it.  Delicious!! I want to be besties with the owner in hopes that I will be blessed with fabulous food all the time.  The pastas are fresh and lots of seafood offering on the menu!! They also curate their wine really well so very happy to make it out here and cannot wait for summer when we can be on the patio!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars.   I've been here multiple times, but the service the last time I was here was awful. It is such a disappointment considering how good the food was all the other times I've been here.    I must admit, their tomato sauce is fantastic! They should bottle it.   Usually, the food here is great, but the last time I was here, their creme brulee did not set (yet was still served), the pasta was stuck together, and our appetizers and entrees were brought all at once. They also forgot our wine order.   I'm not sure what is happening to this place."}
{"text":"Esthetically, the restaurant is lovely, modern and vibrant. We ate here on a busy Saturday night after hearing from locals that Il Ponte was top notch - their glowing reviews was far from what we experienced. The serving staff appeared overwhelmed and disorganized and we felt more like an inconvenience than we did patrons. The food wasn't much better. I ordered the linguine frutti di mare -$24- (pasta with seafood) a mediocre dish that was made worse by the fact that the seafood wasn't washed properly and every mouthful came with a bunch of grit. The absence of mussels in my dish (as stated on the menu) was curious but I overheard the server telling someone else that mussels weren't in season (they're available fresh at any seafood place year-round). The baccala -$28- that my mother-in-law ordered was too salty. Someone should also tell the servers that for Italians, it's blasphemy to put grated cheese on fish. My fiancé ordered the orata -$29- which was good but not staller. We didn't even consider desert because everything else took so long that we just wanted to get out of there.    They could have just had a bad night but the signs point to a need for more experienced staff. My reservation was never logged - thankfully they had a table open or it would have been an embarrassing start to the evening. We ordered sparking water and the waiter just plunked the bottle on the table and didn't pour it for us. We were also left to fill our own wine glasses throughout the night. It points to rookie staff that were too overwhelmed to handle the volume and cracked under the pressure.   The restaurant has potential but with so many great spots in the area that deliver consistently, why would I bother coming back?"}
{"text":"Beautiful Italian Restaurant with great service that makes you feel at home. Vegan options available. Great wine selection."}
{"text":"I have eaten here on three occasions. I don't think I will return. The food was tasty enough but not remarkable. The first time I ordered the gluten free pasta it was undercooked. The patio and ambience are nice. The service is inconsistent. I personally felt that the price for a bowl of pasta with a mediocre sauce was too high. It disappoints me because this is in my neighbourhood. Hopefully, it will improve."}
{"text":"This past weekend we hosted a couples shower for a group of 30. Prior to this we came to check out the place, tried a pizza, and were excited about having our guests join us because everyone we met that evening were very nice. We finished our pre-dinner event earlier and I sent my guests there to have a few drinks before dinner, they arrived about 45 minutes earlier than the reservation. This was clearly a mistake on my end because it was not well received and stressed out the staff. For the entire night I felt bad about this and apologized to Giancarlo multiple times to try and change his mood. I will say now, I have mixed feelings about even feeling bad. Our group was very easy going and polite. It is a celebratory event and I shouldn't have had to feel bad that we showed up early when my guests were very polite and respectful. They nor I were not all greeted as well as we could have been.  I had a set dinner and there was miscommunication here and I should have gotten things cleared up on my end in writing. Giancarlo was gracious and honoured the price we verbally agreed to. Thank you.  Overall food was good, great atmosphere, and most importantly our guests had a great time. This event was something very special for us and we appreciated the accommodation though I wish the service was a little bit friendlier. Without the kindness of one of the staff members - Sharon, I'd lower my rating. This would have easily been a 5 star for us had I not felt I needed to explain myself all evening. I will say it ended well (at least for me), but not for any lack of effort on my end."}
{"text":"New restaurant in the neighborhood.  We had a chance to try their food prior to opening as the owner brought us complimentary samples to our nearby office which was a lovely gesture. The staff and management is top notch - genuine - personable and we felt welcomed by their hospitality - such a nice change from most other restaurants.  We had a complimentary starter and our meals were excellent.  One side pasta could have been hotter - but otherwise everything was exceptional.  We were provided a complimentary dessert as it was our first experience there - which was a nice touch.  An adjacent table was eating something not listed on the menu - and the owner came by and explained that he'll \"cook anything\" if he can - which speaks to the genuine love of the food and the food experience.  The meal was very authentic and reminiscent of our recent travels to Italy."}
{"text":"After a busy but good day of sightseeing, I looked for a nice restaurant close to the Distillery district. We ended up taking a short can ride to Il Ponte cucina Italiana as it started to rain. We got greeted friendly. The menu is short but not too short... Something for everyone... We had the Carpaccio and Caprese as appetizer. Very delicious and perfect portion to start of a nice dinner. The wine selection was also good. As entree we had various pasta dishes as well as the Pizza Amico. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the pizza was made with love - yes you could taste it. To end the day and dinner we had the Tiramisu, Creme Brûlée and the special buonanotte Pizza. Even though the Tiramisu was made with Mascarpone and Cream (not traditional) it was yummy. The Creme Brûlée had a large amount of caramelized sugar on top - exactly as it is supposed to be. The buonanotte Pizza was heaven. A Pizza dough with a mix of Nutella and Mascarpone on top... I had to take the left over back to the hotel - that's how good it was. Our Server was very friendly and was recommending menu items... All in all a very good experience with delicious food. I can only recommend to locals and visitors alike. Thank you for a perfect ending of a nice day in Toronto, ON"}
{"text":"The service is excellent.  The food is even better.   We started with the carpaccio and the calamari fritti.  The carpaccio was fresh and succulent.  The calamari had a light batter and nutty flavour.   My main was the Vitello Toscana.  Veal with cheese, pinenuts, and pancetta.  Very filling!  Finished off with a delightful and light Tiramisu!"}
{"text":"We started off on the wrong foot. I ordered a black Russian to start and they didn't know how to make one. They looked it up on the internet and brought me Kahlua and coke. Not a black Russian. Maybe a black American. I sent it back and I thought I had made a mistake coming here. When my veal chop arrived it was delicious as was the rest of the dinner. the service was great. I will go back again but I will not order a black Russian. otherwise a great place."}
{"text":"This beautiful restaurant effortlessly combines excellent value, great service and an unexpectedly unique location into a winning dish.    We stumbled in with the buzz of high expectations, these were undoubtedly met and perhaps even exceeded.     Perched on the banks of the Don Valley, overlooking the condo jungle that's momentarily masquerading as the Pan Am Games village.   The decor embraces the surroundings, culminating in verbal and visual reference points to the classic Queen Street bridge.      It's casual without feeling cheap.     Classy without feeling contrived.  The relaxed pace is a pleasure.    From the moment we walked in we didn't feel rushed whatsoever.  Even on a busy Saturday night.       It's unapologetically human,  with a comfortable sense of syncopation.   You can peer through to the kitchen, but it's not in your face.      There's small talk.   There's life.    The food is flat out delicious.   In a town with 10000 restaurants, winning our vote for dinner is definitely a competitive sport.     It may just be this restaurant's pre-season,  but we definitely have a great new team in town."}
{"text":"When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie that's amore.  Food - typically Italian. Very good. Gnocchi was excellent. Pizza very good. Tutti i due Insalate that we had were good. Arugula and the IL Ponte.  We ate some chocolate creme Brule for dessert. A little moussy for creme but still I was happy with it.  Modern look to the interior which in some ways makes it an odd Italian place to go to. However the staff still feels Italian and the meal is well done.  Slight mark on the record for slow service. Maybe they are going for the real Italian experience. But I think it was because they were busy/short staffed. Busy is good as they are a good restaurant on a decent street but at the end of Queen where there is much less foot traffic.   Worth a visit."}
{"text":"I made reservation for a birthday party, 6 of us.  They took care of the cake, including getting a name put on it, plus serving it up with candles , dimming the lights and singing to the birthday boy.  The staff were friendly and entertaining - the place was very busy!   Everyone loved their food and we had a great time celebrating!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to il ponte for an anniversary dinner. We absolutely loved it. The mussels were excellent, the pizza a good attempt on Italian style pizza (and we've been to Italy), the fettuccine tasty, and the Nutella pizza desert was magnificent. We were served by the owner's daughter and her energy and enthusiasm helped make the meal that much more fun. Even the basic wine was good. We can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"i love this restaurant soooo much best calamari in the city had an amazing lamb here once and another time amazing mushroom soup the discount wine on tuesday is awesome"}
{"text":"had read about ponte previously and had the opportunity to check it out yesterday. The place looks great! Service was really top notch, the owner/GM  cares about his patrons and business and aims to please. Serving staff was really top notch, especially Cody who took great care to ensure no detail went missed!   Food wise, Ponte does not disappoint and while you will find alot of staples on the menu (Pasta di mare, Caprese salad, etc) there are alot of unique dishes here that help open one's eye to the \"so much more\" to italian cuisine.   Standout dish for me was the \"FUNGHI SALTATI IN PADELLA\" Absolutely incredible dish of sauteed mushrooms. Simple, beautiful, delicious, wow. i could eat it every day.  We had the meaty tagliatelle and it did not disappoint (made for great leftovers as well). Overall, love this place and will be back."}
{"text":"I love dining at Il Ponte, the food is authentic and delicious, the atmosphere is chill and mature with a sense of style. The owner, Giancarlo, makes you feel at home and valued as a guest.  The Ragu is spectacular, its what you think a real sauce should be and this one doesn't disappoint. The menu ranges from pastas, daily seafood and delicious carne selections. In a town where grownup restaurants are few and far between, Il Ponte is welcome respite."}
{"text":"Food was good; specifically the cream sauce was outstanding. The mushroom soup was meaty and tasted fantastic. The service was a bit off. Only 2 young people and the owner are working at the front and the bar. It is a solid restaurant."}
{"text":"Talk about getting it right... First and foremost the food is always authentic-fresh and delicious. The vibe and energy inside is very comfortable. The best part about this establishment is the owner, not many owners are there every night and find a way to get around to every table to not only greet you but to ensure everything is not only up to your standards but to his as well. After a few visits we are now treated like family- In fact if my older son isn't with us for dinner we are usually given a complimentary dessert to take home to him... If there is ANY issue he always finds a way to make it better- a free glass of wine etc. One night I had the baby with me and I was stressing out as my son was starting to get a bit loud and difficult (he is 2) - No problem- Giancarlo ensured me it was ok. Can't recommend this restaurant enough."}
