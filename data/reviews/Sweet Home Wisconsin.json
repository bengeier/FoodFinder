{"text":"While Sweet Home Wisconsin has much in common with its predecessor OSS at the same location, I think it is a better restaurant in almost every regard. It's now cleaner, has a better menu, the food is better and they have plans to expand the seating and improve the beer garden. We ordered the cheeses curds with siracha ranch dipping sauce (great), I had a Chicago style hot dog with fries which better than any I've ever had in Chicago (sorry Portillos). The grilled buffalo chicken sandwich was reported to be very good, as was the burger melt and the dinner salad. Service was great, beer selection was good - our server (who I think is also an owner) was personable and knowledgeable, made helpful beer recommendations including letting me sample one of the beers that sounded too risky to order a full glass without trying it first. Parking is still an issue, but it's definitely worth the trip. I'm looking forward to trying more of their offerings. They even have a potted plant that is named Robert [Plant]."}
{"text":"The curds were definitely the highlight, they remind me a lot of the Old Fashioned. The menu had interesting sandwich options, but we didn't enjoy them very much. Burgers were average, dry bun. The Italian beef was small and seemed more like a pot roast sandwich without the gravy.  The service was rough and confused. Two servers were switching between us, and had a hard time keeping track of us even though it wasn't particularly busy. I received the wrong meal twice."}
{"text":"Food was great! Highly recommend the tomato soup! Service was phenomenal as well. Would definitely come back next time I visit!"}
{"text":"Stopped here after Crazylegs. The outside patio was great on a sunny spring day. And we can highly recommend the pretzels. However the service was slow. And the chicken in the chicken sandwich was so small we had 3/4 of bun left with no chicken."}
{"text":"Sweet home Wisconsin is the perfect mix of classic Midwestern flavors spiked with a modern and creative twist. Colton, at the bar, immediately greeted us and started mixing specialty cocktails tailored to our liking. The Samsquanch was similar to a Margarita but with a smooth and fresh finish. We also had the Joint Juice which was a refreshing change from the usual smoky bourbon cocktail. This mix was a good balance of spicy and fruity with a tang of ginger. We had the jalapeno poppers and the cheese curds with a siracha ranch dipping sauce. Both appetizers were incredible and as a Madison native some of the best fried cheese curds I've ever had! The sauce really pushed these curds over the edge, I can't even explain how amazing they were!! Chef Jon works in the open kitchen just behind the bar, so you can see the magic in action. We had the Rhythm and Rye Reuben which had the juiciest pastrami and tasty Madison Sourdough rye bread. The pub chips that came on the side were not greasy and subtly seasoned to perfection. We cannot wait for the summer patio and more amazing things from Sweet Home Wisconsin!"}
{"text":"THE STAFF IS INCREDIBLE. We received such amazing service and they went above and beyond our expectations.  Not to mention... the food is friggin delicious. We got the garlic burger and cheese curds. I would 1000% recommend it with their Sriracha ranch! Last but certainly not least, the cocktails are incredible! Anything you order will be incredible."}
{"text":"Stopped in late last night, they opened the kitchen back up to make dinner for a fried and I. Cheese curds were amazing and the burgers are great too. The bartender was very knowledgeable and friendly. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Decided to drop in on a Wednesday night and check SWH out.  Not much  has changed from the former restaurant, OSS, in terms of decor and seating other than the fact there is table service vs. counter.  From their Facebook page, they claim to serve up \"nostalgic Wisconsin comfort food with a Chicago twist\".  Don't know exactly what that means but wouldn't call their curds, sandwiches, burgers or hot dog offerings \"Wisconsin comfort\".  And the Chicago twist?  No clue other than they serve italian beef and chicago dogs.  They have a pretty decent beer selection with rotating taps and a selection of cans and bottles.  Along with the food, I will say their price points are few dollars higher than other establishments along Regent.  For the food, I decided on the garlic guitar lick burger advertised with whiskey braised onions, muenster, and garlic aioli and a side of cheese curds (typically it comes with chips).  It was fine but not great.  Appreciate that they used beef from Knoche's that they cook to temperature and the brioche bun from Madison Sourdough was on point.  But flavorwise, I found it lacking.  The burger itself was underseasoned and needed salt.  The aioli was bland and lacked any garlic taste whatsoever.  The same could be said for the cheese curds.The curds themselves were rather small and transformed into hard nuggets once they cooled down.  They definitely needed some sort of dipping sauce.  With chips, the burger comes in at $10.  With the optional cheese curds, it was $13.  As in some of their beer prices, this is on the high side for what was brought to the table.   As they just opened, there are some definite kinks to work out.  The service was a little spotty as well as the vent hood didn't seem to be working as it was rather smoky in the dining room.   I'm planning on stopping back in a few weeks to see if the restaurant has gotten it's sea legs."}
{"text":"Great selection of food and drinks and a very throughout food menu. Drinks are on point and am looking forward to many more visits. Definitely have Colton make you a rum punch and cover yourself in their cheese curds."}
{"text":"I had heard that this place was getting good reviews and that the cheesecurds were some of the better ones in Madison, so I had to try it out. Side note, I'm on the hunt for the best curds in Madison.   Went on a Thursday night with a friend and sat in the back patio section. It was a warm night so it was a little humid out back, but as the sun started setting it was fine.   I ordered the b.b. king burger, but replaced the black bean patty with chicken and then upgraded to cheesecurds. The chicken was seasoned very well, a peppery flavor, and there was just enough avocado and red pepper aioli so that it didn't overtake the sandwich. On to the cheesecurds. They were definitely a good cheesecurd, holding its shape and not overly melty or greasy. However I feel like they could use a little thicker breading to add some texture/flavor.  My friend ordered the garlic guitar lick burger and upgraded to jalapeno poppers. He said that the burger had good flavor, but it did lack a little garlic taste for being called a garlic burger. The best part was the whiskey braised onions, which added a whole lot of flavor to the sandwich. His jalapeno poppers were done just right, with a pepper that still held up and a thick breading on the outside. The cheesecurds could have been an in between of this breading and the one they currently have.    All around it was a pretty good meal. Our only thoughts were that the brioche bun didn't seem to really match the sandwiches, but it was still a good bun. Also since this place is still new they are training some staff, so be patient. That being said, everyone was super friendly and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I haven't been in Madison for long, but this place is what I imagine a quintessential Wisconsin pub is like. All the favorites are here, from the beer selection to excellent fried cheese curds. I had the Munster Melt which was a delicious patty melt with Munster cheese and mushrooms. My girlfriend had the fried fish sandwich with house-made chips.  The music/pop-culture menu and vibe were great. Who doesn't like a Ferris Bueller reference in the Abe Froman sausage sandwich? The staff was friendly and awesome. I will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Excellent food, fast and friendly service. The hot dogs are amazing! If you are looking for a quick bite to eat and a beer then this is the place to go! P.S. Try the cheese curds!"}
{"text":"Very sweet service! I love the atmosphere. The food is quite delicious. Try the rose cider they have on tap, it's to die for!!!!"}
{"text":"This new spot on Regent has great potential! We only got drinks.  I asked for bartenders choice, and the Led Zepplin loving bar manager concocted me a delicious gin drink \"Rambling Man\".  It was a great craft cocktail that included a fresh basil leaf which truly made the cocktail pop.   The decor was very trendy and inviting. It had a lot of character that you don't see much of on Regent St. They mentioned they are still working on some changes with the layout. I can't wait to come back and check it out."}
{"text":"Sweet Home Wisconsin is a great place! We went there for dinner and were able to sit in their backyard with beautiful weather, tasty food and great cocktails. The service is really nice, we will definitely come back."}
