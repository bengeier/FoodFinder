{"text":"Nice place for lunch, compared to the other breakfast/lunch establishment in town, Times Square burgers are better and they don't charge you anything extra for things like tomato or pickle on your burger.  Never been there for dinner."}
{"text":"Great large homemade delicious helpings like the hot turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes. And great homemade pie."}
{"text":"Cute little old school diner from the early 60's. Good for a grilled cheese while you're driving through and the like. They're cash only though which isn't good and the soda is canned. But there's nothing else in the area so what can you do?"}
{"text":"Really great for what it is: a rural diner, far from the beaten path, with homemade everything.

The outside reminds me of the Whistlestop Caf√© from Fried Green Tomatoes.  And it is also tiny.  If you have a party of more that four, the only seating option is a long table in a cramped side room next to the bathrooms.  Probably four booths and a few four-tops.

The menu is pretty diverse, but standard diner fare.  Breakfast is served all day, but once they run out of their locally sourced sausage gravy for the day, it's gone.  That seems to be their most popular item.

We went for dinner, and I had the chicken parm sandwich, which was perfectly crispy, and obviously hand breaded. My sister had the country fries steak (CFS!!!) and I had to try it.  Again, definitely homemade as was the gravy.

One nephew had fried shrimp, which was just ok, but the spicy horseradish was amazing.  The other had pancakes-  they were enormous, both wide and thick.  I will be ordering them next time.

Finally, the prices are amazing.  You would be hard up to spend more than 10 bucks per person.

Oh, and probably a dozen fresh pies available each day.  Not my thing, but another thing they are known for."}
{"text":"A sentimental favorite from my youth. I have been going here since the '60s. Great for homemade pies and the specials. Not as good as the days when Alice Blaemire ran it. If you are in Kinsman, check it out"}
{"text":"Cute old time diner with hearty home cooked food.  Good breakfast menu!  Loved the sausage gravy over home fries.  Homemade desserts.  It says Cash Only but they now take credit cards."}
