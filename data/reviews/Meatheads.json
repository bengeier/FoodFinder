{"text":"The food was ok. You get a lot of food for the price. There is bot a lot of seating."}
{"text":"I've been to Meatheads twice since they opened. The first time I had their basic 1/3 lb cheeseburger with all the trimmings (\"grilled\" onion, lettuce, tomato, mayo, ketchup, and pickles). I also shared a mocha shake. The food arrived fast and the burger was great, except I was certain they made a mistake since the onion on my burger was raw (still crunchy and spicy). Still a good, but greasy burger. The shake was the real star; it tasted like it was made with fresh coffee.  My second visit I got the same with the addition of fries. The total was about $12, so it's not the cheapest burger joint in town. Biting into my burger I got the same raw onion taste. So, it seems to me they heat the onions on the grill, but don't actually grill them; it was still white. The second go at the mocha shake was just as good as the first with an intense coffee flavor. The small order of fries was huge, and probably more than I should have eaten.  As others have said, parking is a mess. The restaurant probably has twice as many tables as parking spaces."}
{"text":"I have gone here a few times. I find the burgers tasty and I am glad you can customize. The price is a bit high after adding fries and a drink. The drink machines are cool and the cajun fries are very tasty. The atmosphere is very clean and modern. I also like that they have a drive thru which takes about the same amount of time as sitting in the Steak and Shake drive thru. When I am craving a burger and don't want to go to a sit down place then I will probably go here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were having a craving for burgers and decided to give Meatheads a try as opposed to going to our regular bar for burgers. We regretted it as soon as we took the first bite.  The burger here was greatly unimpressive and meat itself was mostly tasteless. I like it when I have a rich beefy taste to the burger patty, but this one did not have a trace of it. (so much for advertising the beef ... ) The burger was dripping with grease and it soaked the bun with the grease which made it soggy. Needless to say, eating became a messy ordeal.   For two burgers, drinks, and fries (regular and cajun) we spent nearly $22!!! I was thinking this was gonna be the best burgers I've had, but it was a huge let down.   I'm not coming back for sure. Much too expensive, burgers AND fries were subpar. Even if it was cheap, I would pay more for something that actually tastes good.   At least the people were nice. Decor was very modern and clean. Oh and they had the new coke machines. But those things wouldn't be any reason why I would come again."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great staff.  Very friendly and attentive!  Never dissatisfied!  Fries are awesome!  My go to when I need a burger fix!!"}
{"text":"Not bad.  Got the 1/3 Texas something or another burger with bacon, lettuce, tomato and grilled onions.  Portions were huge, swimming in grease.  The fries were alright, but not the best; crispy, but not too much potato.  The white bread buns were cold; with all the other toppings the texture clashed with the grilled burger and crispy toppings.   I wished they would toast the bun slightly to make it fit.  \"It's basically an okay Five Guys\" says my friend.    It isn't the best burger around.  I was hoping for better meat, and a big honking patty over two stacked slim slices of meat.   I gave it three since 11 dollars for the full meal is a lot for just an alright burger.  I will try it again, and recommend it to anyone who wants to try that \"upscale\" burger joint."}
{"text":"My son loves the burgers and fries, as well as the chicken. Great customer service--they forgot an item & replaced it within minutes. Staff are always super friendly, and inside it's welcoming and family friendly."}
{"text":"I can't really say anything bad about the restaurant experience, other than to note the menu is very, very limited, if you don't want a burger ... But then again, the name of the restaurant is Meatheads ... Also a very sterile environment, and very loud, with lots of hard surfaces reflecting every sound.  More significantly, the burger was a major disappointment! The best description would be GREAT selection of toppings on an extremely ordinary and virtually tasteless hamburger patty, and a Wonderbread bun. I mean, the bun was really disappointing ...   My girlfriend and I each had a burger - no fries and no drinks - and it came to $12. With fries and drinks it would have been $20.  Seriously, I would have been more satisfied with a McDonalds or Burger King hamburger - maybe not so fancy but half the price ...  Honestly, I would never go out of my way to return to this restaurant, and anybody who recommends the burgers at this restaurant as anything more than mediocre has really questionable taste in food ... IMHO."}
{"text":"We ate at Meatheads on June 14th 2014, everything was fabulous.   The service was excellent,  the manager is fabulous and my burger was amazing.   Hands down ten times better than 5 Guys!    We will definitely be back...."}
{"text":"As most other people have mentioned, Meatheads takes after the Five Guys burger model.  Didn't try the fries, but I enjoyed the Cajun Sunrise burger, though I might recommend it without Jalepenos, as it overwhelmed the taste of the burger.  It's a little pricey, and there are definitely better burgers out there, but not bad.  I would give this place a 3.5 but I'll round up due to balance out some of the strange negative reviews about the menu and greasy food.  Yes, they have only burgers, and yes, burgers are often greasy."}
{"text":"Brought the burger-loving boy here the day after Meatheads opened to check it out. It was packed, but we received friendly greetings from the staff (GM and owner(s)? were there). The restaurant has counter service, where you order your burgers and then go to your table while everything is made to order. We each got 1/3 lb meatheads (there is also a 1/2 lb and kid's option) and a large fries to share. There are many premium toppings available to add to your burger for free (roasted red peppers, sauteed mushrooms, grilled onions, sauerkraut), while cheese, bacon, avocado, and fried egg (!) cost a little bit extra. I got a handful of standard toppings, and the boy got everything. Our food came out in ~5-6 minutes. The fries were fantastic, crispy with the skins left on. A large ($3) is enough to feed two hungry fry-loving grad students. A sign says that these are cut fresh daily... filling the C-U void for decent potato fare. As far as the burgers go, I quite liked that I could taste the beef through the toppings. The burger ($4.50 + $1 for cheese) was greasy to hold (on the outside of the bun and also dripping from the burger itself), but everything tasted clean and I didn't feel like I had been salt bombed afterward. The bun was soft and sturdy.. appropriate for the type of toppings offered. My burger did not go slip sliding away.  Meatheads also offers several dipping sauces (for fries or to be added on to burgers), handspun milkshakes, and two freestyle coke machines. The food is satisfying and tasty (craveable? perhaps), the location is clean and bright, and the people are friendly. Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Well to follow up from my previous review... I was surprised when I was contacted by Joe, who I believe is the HR guy from meatheads. Anyway he went out of his way to make up for my experience and I can say I am a fan again."}
{"text":"Love the food, love the service. These guys are great! Definitely try the cajun fries."}
{"text":"I'm not a burger person, but Meatheads is freaking awesome. The cajun fries are awesome, too."}
{"text":"I spent two weeks in Champaign on business, and to my delight, discovered Meatheads. I enjoyed it so much that I went in almost daily. The staff is warm and friendly. The management is delightfully positive and very helpful. They always put a smile on my face.   The food stands out from the competition. You can choose from a list of sandwiches with predetermined ingredients, or build your own. I tried nearly every sandwich on the menu and was more and more impressed with each one. The Cajun fries are a must; salty, crispy, and they have that perfect hint of spice.   From somebody who had never had meatheads before, it is absolutely worth trying, and frequenting. I will miss this place."}
{"text":"This place is is like five guys only way better. The fact that you can get specialty burgers like the bacon ranch or the rueben gives this place a solid advantage over the competion,  the cajun fries are better than five guys. The customer service here is well above average as well,  great place to get a really tasty burger."}
{"text":"Great selection of toppings, the cajun fries were tasty, but as for the burger itself, it's no Farren's.  If it were cheaper, I'd probably be fine with the quality.  I may return, but it won't be my top pick if I'm in the mood for a burger."}
{"text":"While Meatheads is more expensive than McDonald's, it's also higher quality food, has better service, and the whole place just has a better design vibe. I'm willing to pay a bit more for that.   They are great about gluten free. I have never felt sick after eating here if I tell them about the sensitivity when I am ordering. It's nice to be able to go out with my family to someplace that isn't really expensive. Places that offer gluten free are usually high end, and they are few and far between here in town."}
{"text":"So today I was hungry and decided to try out something new. I'm from Chicago, which means I'm use to Chicago style food. I tend to stick to what I know. So I go thru the drive thru and right off the the back Jason was clear and happy (even with the raspy voice) it let me know the food was fresh and that was a big pulse for me. I order the 1/3 meathead burger with American cheese, ketchup mustard, pickles and bacon. Jason ask me if I wanted fries but I had to pass. I ask for an orange soda because that was one of the options on the menu. Then Jason ask me what kind fanta, church, ect. That's when I realized that meatheads had the big soda machine. So I request a strawberry lemonade. Drove to the window got my food and went home. The burger was good. I felt like it was missing something one it but I couldn't put my finger on it. Maybe I needed more toppings. But I had a great experience and will be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for Easter since all the dining halls were closed and we couldn't go home for the holiday. The employees, especially the manager, were so incredibly nice. I always feel guilty coming into restaurants on the holidays, and I know the pain of working on holidays as well. Everyone was so friendly and of course the food was great. I highly recommend going (but avoid going on holidays, I mean come on, don't be that person)."}
{"text":"Yuck.  Normally I like to try a place a couple times before writing a review but I will not be getting anything else from this place.  My girlfriend's coworkers got take-out from here and she got a burger and a sandwich for me.  Her burger had avocado, lettuce, and tomato.  My sandwich was an ALT - avocado lettuce tomato on white bread.  So there was similarity.  When we got it, the paper around both sandwiches was soaked through in grease and translucent.  This is not, in fact, necessarily a negative.  I didn't get food from a burger place to eat healthy.  I love seeing the grease on the wrapping paper from Derald's on their breakfast sandwiches.  My sandwich was disappointing.  It had enough avocado - once I could find it in the almost half cup of mayonnaise on the sandwich.  The lettuce was iceberg lettuce and uninteresting.  The tomato was okay.  The bread was just white bread, fried in some kind of cheap vegetable oil.  That made the sandwich much \"heavier\" and unpleasantly greasy.  Like I said, I don't mind some grease, but this stuff tasted cheap and stale.  After eating it, I felt kinda sick later in the day.    My girlfriend's burger had much less avocado.  The patties were extremely thin and bland.  The bun wasn't great either.  For all they talk about fresh ingredients on the website, I am not seeing the quality reflected in the food.  The prices aren't cheap, either - $5 and up even for veggie sandwiches and up to $10 for burgers.  Fries are extra - so we didn't get any, but I hadn't heard good things about them.  Compare this to Black Dog, where you get an awesome burger and fries or other side for $8.  Or Derald's, where the burgers are much cheaper and the veggies look more freshly sliced.  If you must eat at a chain, try Culver's, even that's a much better deal, I think.  Since we got take-out I can't comment on the restaurant itself.  I would still never get food from them again.  Edit: a note on this review.  After it had been up for a little while, I was contacted via Yelp message by someone from Meatheads.  They apologized profusely for my dissatisfaction and offered me a complementary meal in the future.  I haven't taken them up on it - I'm still not in a huge hurry to go back - but they are trying to address unhappy reviews, and I think that's worth noting."}
{"text":"Don't know how this place isn't 5 star across the board. I never was a burger person until my husband brought me here and I was hooked. Convenience of the drive thru when I've had a long day but still want a quality meal is what brings me back. We've been probably 25 times or more in the past year or so, John has taken care of us almost every time and goes above and beyond for us. The price isn't McDonald's for a reason guys... it's QUALITY and that's something you don't come across just anywhere. Fresh chicken strips, fresh fries, we've never once been served old food and that's what brings us back!! Consistently good quality every time, period."}
{"text":"Okay, after a couple years of going here regularly, I'm upgrading their review. The service is great, the prices seem lower, and the portions of fries got bigger. This is now my go-to fast casual burger place. Farrens is still better, but they don't do carryout on Fridays."}
{"text":"Surprisingly a not so great place for meatheads to eat. Food is really greasy. That's probably the main ingredient, grease. They drown everything in fats and their cajun spices to mask the mediocrity of their other ingredients. I would not recommend this place but it's not inedible."}
{"text":"What a great start for a great concept!  I have been to Meatheads 6 times since it has opened.  From the first time that I took my children, the service was genuine, friendly and helpful.  The burgers were great, the hot dog was unique, the coke machine was nothing like I have ever seen and my children LOVED it, and the fries are the best!  But what stands out to me is the genuine personality given by the staff.    I wanted to also address the comments regarding the price!  Every time that I have been there, the prices are right next to each item on the menu. It is a little expensive but maybe these are the prices this restaurant needs to keep it going, employee and compensate good personnel and god help them, make a profit.    Good luck Meatheads, keep it up!"}
{"text":"Just finished a wonderful salad called \"the chopped wedge.\" Ordered it as listed on the menu board but added the  crispy chicken. The iceberg lettuce was cold and crisp. I asked my husband when he had ever seen me eat a salad without dressing. Answer was \"never.\" That' s how great this salad was. Have to add the blue cheese vinaigrette was very good ... I dipped my chicken in it! Great staff every time we go."}
{"text":"Good food and nice service. The England Dog and Bacon Egg Sandwich are awesome."}
{"text":"Very impressed!  The decor was clean and modern. First impression was very positive. The order taker was great, very? upbeat with a fun vibe. Best of all was the food. Fantastic burger and delicious fries. I got the Hawaiian burger. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I think they may have the best burgers in town.  The staff are very polite and accommodating. I'm a regular customer."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers and tons of options.  The sides are really good, too (check out the Cajon Fries).    Also, it's worth going just because of the fountain drinks.  Way more options than any other food joint in Chambana.  I don't really know what else to say.  Their food is excellent, service is fine.  It's a great place to visit when you're really craving something tasty."}
{"text":"Well, I went back to Meatheads with intentions to give it a second try. I figured this time I'd try an Oreo milkshake and a specialty burger, while sticking with the Cajun Fries. In all, this experience was much better than the first. The specialty burgers are the way to go, and the Oreo Milkshake was better than the Chocolate milkshake I got on my first try of Meatheads. I will be going back, but it's still a bit pricey to be my main choice of restaurant. Still, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good burger.  Also, this time I noticed how involved Meatheads was with the community. They had a wall devoted to the sports for the high school's in the area. I thought that was a great idea. Just a side note."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, but the service was a little slow.  Those burgers, Cajun fries and shakes are amazing.  Lots of great choices for beverages and toppings."}
{"text":"Lame. Doesn't hold a candle to Five Guys. Burgers were greasy and buns were stale. The produce on the burgers wasn't great either. Fries were lame. Just a very average burger if you ask me."}
{"text":"Very clean and bright inside with friendly staff. Everything we got was positively dripping in grease. The burgers were okay, but I wanted to wash my hands the second that I finished. Good Oreo milkshake, too."}
{"text":"Very overpriced ...a family of four cost us $45 for lunch... Fries were very good but the burgers were just average, very thin.... The soda machine was cool though... Many choices for one brand \"coke\".... The buns were not impressive either!"}
{"text":"When I go out to get food I tend to stick with chicken instead of beef since it's more healthy for you. I love the selection of toppings that I can get on my sandwich and a coworker actually recommended I get extra jalapenos since I mentioned how I absolutely love the fact that Meatheads has FRESH jalapenos. It. Is. Amazing. The chicken is always juicy! And their Cajun fries are great too. Also they have those cool fountain machines that allow you to select the type and add flavoring to.  The staff is great as well. They great you promptly and will even come by your table to chat with you and make sure everything came out okay. They are also community oriented! Last time I went I looked at the high school football board of local high schools and read some of the teams game stats.  It may be a bit more expensive then your average fast food joint like McDs or Burger King but it is so worth the price!"}
{"text":"Tried quite a few burgers in town during my first year here. Meatheads has become my burger of choice. The staff is incredibly friendly, the food arrives fast, and you can build your own delicious burger. So stop eating crap burgers from McDonald's/Burger King/Wendy's and other cheap fast food joints. Upgrade to Meatheads!"}
{"text":"I made good on my promise to give Meatheads another try, and I did my best to leave my last experience at the door and give the restaurant a fresh start. At this point, Meatheads has been open in Champaign for over a year and a half, so I expect most of their kinks have been worked out, and my experience is fairly standard.  I'm still not impressed. Sorry, Meatheads. I wanted to like you. This time, I ate in the restaurant. It was a Thursday, shortly after noon. The restaurant was busy-ish; not packed, ample seating options, but doing some good business. I ordered a similar burger to my first - a cheeseburger with fresh avocado, and I split an order of fries with Husband. I also got a soft drink, because they have the Coca-Cola Freestyle machines. I have a soft spot for those machines. I don't drink a lot of soda, but there's something that appeals to the kid in me when I can make a strawberry Sprite! ANYWAY.  Pros - Customer service while ordering. The cashier was friendly, efficient, and got my order right.  Drinks - Again, love those Freestyle machines. Way to go.  Mehs - Fries. I didn't not like my fries. I also wasn't blown away. They were fine.  Cons - The burgers are just *too* greasy. I'm sorry. Maybe some people like that, but I don't appreciate an active stream of grease dribbling off of my sandwich. The bottom bun was soaked with grease before I even had a chance to take a bite. The burgers just aren't up my alley. Price - The burgers aren't very big considering the price. I still think it's a little steep for what you get, especially compared to some of the other burger options in town. Customer service while eating - There were at least three staff members making regular rounds. This is good - if you need something. I don't like the feeling, however, of being rushed, and as soon as anyone picked up the last fry/burger bit/etc from their tray, a staff member would swoop down, ask a hurried \"Areyoufinished\" and grab the plate. This unnerves me. Also, Husband wanted to use his burger plate for a ketchup rest for his portion of the fries, but as the staff member had already grabbed his plate, he let it go. Is this a huge deal? No. Is it kind of.. rude? I felt so. I appreciate that the staff is trying to be helpful, but the constant circling is off-putting. I realize I may be picky, so I encourage anyone who is curious to give Meatheads a try. I did ask, again, for my dining companions' opinions, and they also weren't very impressed. Husband had been with me before, but we were dining with a friend who had never gone - in fact, it was his desire to try Meatheads that convinced us to go back and give it another try. None of us are planning a return trip. YMMV."}
{"text":"Of all the Meathead locations - from here to Chicago, the Champaign location trumps all.   They have the best kindest managers/employees- it's always a great experience at such a positive place - we love dining-in.   By far our favorite location and restaurant in Champaign, IL.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Hey y'all! If you're jonesin' for a quality burger with lots of flavor in the patty and options galore to pile on top of it - Meatheads is the right place! First timer in Illinois and it was an excellent choice in my book!! Got a western-style burger and a hot dog, yum! Service was extremely high-energy and on top of it at the register, at the table and right before I walked out the door. Big thanks to Angie for helping me pick the perfect lunch to grub on!!"}
{"text":"First of all I do not care for hamburgers but once in a while I will get one.  I drove by Meatheads and noticed they had a drive through.& I decided to give it a try.  Not a big menu.  I had the kids meal which included french fries, cheeseburger and a teeny tiny drink.  I am also not huge fan of french fries either (yes, I am American) but as far as french fries go these were excellent.  The cheeseburger was OK too.  I think it taste just like Culver's.  You can get a cheaper burger at Culver's but their french fries are gross so if you are going for the whole meal thing this place would be your best bet.  And they don't skimp on the FF, they give you plenty!!!  The staff in the drive through were super nice.  I tried to do a check in on Yelp here but it did not list it on my phone for some reason."}
{"text":"Can someone please explain why Central Illinoians (Illini?) make such a big deal of this place?!? The burgers are waaaaay overpriced, the fries are vastly medial, the meat is over-cooked, and the patties are about the size of something you'd get at Mickey D's... Thanks, but no thanks, I'm taking my money to 5 guys!"}
{"text":"Went here one time after driving by it thousands of times. Just had the taste for a good burger. I was shocked in a good way. Very well put together restaurant, simple enough menu, excellent staff (the girl on the register was in training even), and the food was ready very quickly and they were busy. The food was excellent btw. Excellent burger and fries."}
{"text":"Stopped by on the way to Chicago simply because the parking lot was full at two in the afternoon.  What a happy accident to walk into this place.  Clean and modern with a cool concept oriented around quality ingredients, fresh baked buns, and amazing service.  Our group tried several different burgers and they were all exceptional.  Chain is also socially responsible and has a program in place to honor young achievers in the local school system."}
{"text":"I went again and my experience was much better the second time around. This time I decided to try one of the recommended burgers (I think they were called Chef Inspired) instead of building my own. I had the Hawaiian - Pineapple, Jalapenos, cheese, and bbq sauce I think. It was much better - my burger was a lot less greasy, and it stayed together quite well. I got the Cajun fries again, those were pretty good as well.  I went again with a large group (7 people) and the staff saved a table for us while we were in line. That was awesome, since it was pretty crowded on a Saturday night.  Pros: Tasty burger. A large fry is plenty for 2 people to split. Not overloaded on cajun flavor. Staff was excellent again. I didn't get a milkshake, but they looked kinda expensive for the size (but supposedly they taste pretty good).  Cons: Fries were alright. I had a lot of little pieces in the order I split with a friend.  Overall I had a much better second experience at Meatheads. I would recommend that you try one of the chef inspired burgers! I can say that I will come back here again."}
{"text":"Not worth the price. My husband and I each had a regular burger, fries and drink and our two kids each got a kids meal. It cost us $35. The burgers were mushy. Again, not worth it."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Great service, great food. 1/3 lb burger and a regular fry got me super stuffed. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Meatheads and my impression was mixed.  The grilled chicken sandwich was excellent.  I believe the fries were good, the problem was they were way too salty, WAY too salty.  It's not a good idea to shorten the lifespan of your customers.  One can add more salt if one wants to but it's tough to  remove the salt.    Most disappointing was the mocha shake.  I decided to try Meatheads b/c I saw you had coffee and mocha shakes.  It was icy and had what appeared to be instant coffee granules floating in it.  It had a very strong coffee taste, mind you I love coffee but I was in the mood for mocha, that's why I ordered a mocha shake.  If I wanted to I could make a coffee shake from instant coffee and ice cream, but I don't want to.  Why wouldn't you use real coffee or start with coffee ice cream?  I had to take it home and add chocolate syrup and some milk."}
{"text":"A but pricey but the food was great, inside very clean, and the safety was attentive and friendly.  I'll be back every now and hen but I'd come more often if they could trim the prices a bit."}
{"text":"The service is always phenomenal. They are kind, quick, and very thoughtful (coming out to apologize for a longer wait, stopping to ask if you need anything when it's not really a sit down restaurant, etc.)   I don't eat beef so I'm not an expert on their burgers, but I get chicken sandwiches there with whatever I please on them and I am ALWAYS thoroughly happy. Plus, the Cajun fries are to die for."}
{"text":"The manager Josh is the prime example of leader. super friendly with his employee but stills gets the job done right. He made the atmosphere in the store great & I loved my burger that he recommended. Being a JJ Business Coach I know the ends & out of how to run a proper business & Josh is killing it! Very impressed.This guy deserves a promotion! Would be great at developing future General Managers. Awesome experience at meatheads!"}
{"text":"Good food! Nicely sized portions and great taste! It's not like the usual fast food burger place. Has high quality food, nice facility, and fast service. It's a little pricy for a burger place, but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Have had some good meals and some poor meals. Everything is decent but overpriced for it. The first time I went was an awful experience where the bun was soggy to the point it was cold and falling apart. Second time it tasted great, no soggy bun. Ever since then there has been a weird consistency of inconsistency where it was sometimes good and sometimes bad."}
{"text":"We've eaten here probably a dozen times in the last six months, and every single time the experience has been perfect.  We typically order the \"chef-inspired\" burgers (Californian, Hawaiian, Reuben, etc.). We've tried them all, and they're all great.  I've eaten burgers at a lot of places in CU and I'd say Meatheads ties with Crane Alley for my favorite burgers.  (I even like them better than, e.g. Seven Saints, Destihl, and other high end places.)  Crane Alley has fancier ingredients, but the quality is at the same high level at both places.  I think that's very impressive for fast food.  The other meals are good too.  My daughter loves the chicken tenders, which are crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside, unlike the dry chewy stuff you get at many fast food places.  She also loves the hot dog, which is a real footlong.  The fries are really, really good.  And this is surprising considering they make them from fresh potatoes.  Most places that I have been to that make fresh-cut fries (including, e.g. Five Guys) make a soggy, greasy mess that tastes like raw potatoes.  Meatheads makes a hot, crispy pile of deliciousness that is really hard to beat.  And with the cajun seasoning on them they are my favorite fries in town.  FWIW they will also put things on them (bacon, cheese, etc.) if you want.  The management at Meatheads is superb.  Whenever we go at a busy meal time when the place is packed, the manager is always out on the floor watching *everything* and picking up the slack wherever it's necessary.  This is exactly what a manager should be doing, but it is so rare in fast food that it is actually a pleasure to watch him and his employees do their jobs.  It's like watching a well-oiled machine.  Cooking is my hobby.  I love fancy food.  But this place is my guilty pleasure.  I never thought I'd say this about a fast food restaurant, but to be honest it is my favorite American restaurant in town."}
{"text":"I come here when I'm craving a burger with my own pizazz. It's a little pricy, but they give you tons of fries and I enjoy the fancy soda machines.   If they mess up something, they will acknowledge it and fix it immediately. They want you to leave a full and happy customer."}
{"text":"The absolute best Burgers and chicken tenders EVER, but also the best possible service!! Jason is amazing and the type of person who makes you want to go back to a place even if the food was terrible. From every single aspect, 10/10. I'll definitely be back! Jason, keep doing what you're doing and keep smiling! The world needs more of you. You rock, my friend."}
{"text":"Had 5 guys and thought they were tops....BUT....this place is a step above. My wife is a stickler for cleanliness, and this is one of the cleanest places in town....much cleaner than 5 guys altough they are reasonable clean. Fantastic burger, and the quality is great. Also have a superb New England style foot long dog. Try the chilli fries...hand cut and over the top good. Toppings? Tons of toppings from pineapple to avocado, and on and on! Very clean....had a problem with a burger,( a little under-cooked) and the manager insisted I take a gift card that was twice the amount we spent for supper! You tell me where you can get that kind of service and support ?  Excellent, clean and ourstanding staff!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was great ! The food was pretty good ! I love their Cajun fries ! Those are amazing . The burger was decent but for the price I feel like it could have been better . For a meal including the drink you aren't going to walk out of there spending anything less right around ten dollars per person . So it can get very pricey !"}
{"text":"Picture this- It's 4:30 on a Thursday evening. You have fasted ALL DAY because you're pregnant and had to get your blood drawn today at 3:00. You are wrapping up a stressful day at the office and are thinking about dinner. A coworker tells you to try Meatheads, a place you have never heard of before. You look them up and begin to scan their menu. Everything looks exquisite. From the long list of possibilities, you narrow down exactly what you want and write it on a post-it (being pregnant, you often forget things so you just wanted to make sure you would know exactly what you wanted when you got there). You decide to get a crispy chicken sandwich with tomato, mayo, avocado, and provolone cheese. An order of chili cheese fries. And an Oreo milkshake.  Your tummy rumbles.  You CAN NOT wait to get the hell out of the office and get to Meatheads.  That was me about 2 hours ago.  When I arrived to the Meatheads drive thru (because why would I drag my pregnant fat ass inside anywhere?? I live in America) I was immediately greeted by the friendliest voice who kindly took my order. I then drove to the window where I was greeted with my milkshake. Hell yea. This day just got so much better.  The lady told me it was going to be a few minutes for my food (they make everything from scratch so what do you expect???) and then offered me another drink while I was waiting! I've never had anyone do that anywhere! It was wonderful. I waited about 6 or 7 minutes for my food but it was sooooo worth the wait! When I got home, I was ready to devour all the wonderful goodness that was inside my take out bag. I decided to indulge in the burger first.  Oh. My. God. This is the best thing I have ever put in my mouth. Ever. I paid extra for the avocado and the rest of the toppings were free. So like any other \"fast food\" place, I was expecting them to skimp on the toppings. OH HELLLLLL NO! Anywhere I've ever gone and asked for avocado, there has never been more than a spoonful because avocado is just so damn expensive. BUT I KID YOU NOT THESE PEOPLE LITERALLY PUT AN ENTIRE AVOCADO ON MY SANDWICH. (Alright maybe I'm exaggerating just a tad but seriously. It was the best.) there was also cheese melting off the sides and legit 5 slices of tomato! (Yes I counted because I didn't believe it at first) Holy crap this sandwich was LOADED. And delicious.  Now, lets move on to those chili cheese fries. They were $4 or $5...something like that. I just figured they were a little over priced and it would be a small helping like literally everywhere else makes theirs. WRONG. This thing of chili cheese fries was LITERALLY THE SIZE OF MY HEAD! I took 4 bites and had to save the rest for my husband. There was definitely enough for 4 people to share easily. Plus, after my 15 minute drive home, everything was still super hot.  Alright. I think I covered everything. Now get up and go to Meatheads immediately. It will be the best decision of your entire life."}
{"text":"My go to place for burgers and fries. What I really like is that their menu has few options and all options are good. The place is also pretty clean."}
{"text":"Always enjoy it every time I go nice juicy burger and great fries. Speedy service clean restaurant. Delivers on every level much better than the over hyped five guys."}
{"text":"Really fresh.  Hot.  Plenty of food.  Shakes yummy.  Nice clean friendly place.  Pretty busy for Sunday.   Will b back"}
{"text":"Simply put; this place has some of the best burgers in the area. What sets Meatheads apart from most other burger joints is your ability to FULLY customize your burger. When I say fully, I mean it literally. You can choose your type of bun/bread, patty size, and all of the toppings and condiments you could ever want.  Love stopping here after a long day when the girlfriend and I don't feel like cooking. It's a great place to just grab and go, although the inside is nice for dining in as well. Keep doing what you're doing Meatheads and we'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Food was good staff was great !! Very friendly atmosphere they forgot my bacon on my burger manager took care of it quickly pumpkin pie shake was great. Price is reasonable."}
{"text":"These may not be the absolute best burgers in Champaign, but the boost comes from the excellent service. Every single time I go, the servers and cashiers are incredibly kind and welcoming, not just to me but to everyone. I've come in exhausted from long journeys or long days of studying and had the cashier ask how I was doing and check on me later to make sure everything was okay. I've done work in the booths (when its not busy, of course) and listened to podcasts while I ate, so it's an easy place to hang out and relax if you want. The decor is modern and clean, which is always a plus, with nice, soft lighting and it never gets too loud.  The food is pretty delicious. I love both their chicken sandwiches and burgers, and with fries I flip-flop between original and cajun because their so tasty. I always get the Californian for its fresh, crisp taste and everytime I ask for no tomato, they always remember (which is more than I can say for other burger joints). The fact that they have those ultra-soda machines is also pretty nice (as I love ginger ale and almost no restaurants in town have fountain ginger ale).  I like that the store is also more community/high school oriented than college oriented. As a grad student at the university, I get that the majority of businesses make their haul on the income of college students but Meatheads chooses to focus on the other members of the community. They have a scoreboard for local student sports and even have discounts for high school student, which I think goes a long way in creating the vibe of the restaurant. Overall, a delicious and community-oriented restaurant that serves that homey feeling in all the right ways."}
{"text":"The new building is cool. The service was outstanding. The meat itself tasted just like Steak and Shake. The bun was a little better."}
{"text":"The burgers are definitely a cut above. They are comparable in price to the nice burgers in town at the Courier, Esquire, Crane Alley, etc. ($4-$7, depending on what you order). My husband still thinks that the Courier has the best burgers, but Meatheads blew the competition away for me. You get a larger portion of excellent tasting beef for the price. Every burger has at least two patties. Nearly everything about my regular meathead burger was perfect. The only room for improvement is the bun...but it wasn't bad at all--just not as gourmet as the rest of the burger. They have lots of fancy options. My husband really liked his Cajun Burger (although it was pretty messy to eat!) The fries are fresh, cut thin with skins on, and also served in large quantities. I have yet to try the shakes because Custard Cup is right down the street...  The ambiance is casual and clean--a wide variety of songs played, not too loudly. There's plenty of seating and room to spread out, although I have seen it get pretty packed. This would be a great place to come with a big group because you could easily push tables together. They give you a number so that you can sit down after ordering and wait for a server to bring your food. The food comes very quickly. They also have the world's most high tech soda machine, with a touch screen menu of more than your average options. There's a drive through as well.  Obviously eating here costs more than a fast food place would, but it tastes so much better. You're not eating pink slime, chemicals, fillers, or trans-fats, and it's obvious. It's still cheaper than eating out at a \"sit-down restaurant.\" Tonight, my husband and I spent $16 for a filling meal for two and didn't have to tip anyone. When I'm in the mood for a burger at a casual place, this is where I will go."}
{"text":"I was expecting a slightly higher quality fast-food burger, but I was totally blown away by Meatheads food and service! I visited at lunchtime, and although they were packed, the friendly and funny staff quickly found us a table. The atmosphere reminded me of a popular Chicago restaurant, but much more fun and personal. And the FOOD! Oh my gosh. My burger was HUGE with so many delicious/unique toppings to choose from, and they don't skimp at all! It was definitely one of the best burgers I've ever had. Amazing work, Meatheads!"}
{"text":"Thank you for settimg up and reserving tables for the ECHS WYSE team today.  The food was delicious and all the kids loved their meals. They especially liked the cajun fries and creamy shakes."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best burger joints in town. Great burgers, great fries. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Meatheads is something I found when I moved to Champaign. I had never heard of it before. I'm so glad I found it! Especially the one off of Niel. Every time I go the service and employees are wonderful so nice! Today I called ahead to order and while giving my order the employee listed off cheeses you can get on a hot dog. When he mentioned blue cheese I said whaaat?? Who puts blue cheese on a hot dog?? He joked and said I do and I love it. When I went to pick up my order the woman read off my order and mention a 3rd hot dog. I was confused because I only ordered 2. When she read the toppings of the 3rd got dog it had blue cheese on it. I thought weird and let her know that wasn't for my order. Then the manager came over and told me he gave us a free hot dog with blue cheese, bacon tomatoes and red onion for free because I just had to try it! It was such an awesome gesture that was not expected. Soooooo the blue cheese hot dog....pretty amazing! I will be ordering it next time I go! You have to try and and you have to go to THIS Meatheads! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"The manager is fantastic. Do to allergies to corn starch he jumped right in and offered to make the crispy chicken with straight flour. I didn't even have to ask. This place has great food. Any place that cares about each customer so particularly and precisely deserves highest kudos and stars. The place clean and neat. The young lady behind the register was sweet and helpful as can be. And all this before we even paid or ate!"}
{"text":"I came in right at 11am, and there was no line.... but by the time I left about 15 minutes later, the place was filling up fast!   The burgers here are hand-formed which is a big plus for me and the fries are cut fresh -- another huge plus!!   I ordered a l'il meathead which is a single burger with lettuce, tomatoes, ketchup, grilled onions and jalepenos!  The jalepenos are super-fresh green.... not the kind that sit in brining liquid for years.   The lettuce was crisp, but a little yellow and everything was super fresh.  You order at the front, they give you a number, you sit down, and then they bring you your food in about 5 minutes!  They also have this crazy cool touch screen soda machine so you can have custom-made sodas like Fanta Grape/Pip/Sprite/Diet RootBeer or some other weird concoction.   Anyways, I ordered cajun fries which were super crisp and had just the right amount of kick!  I have no complaints about this place so far!!!   Way better than Five Guys (I don't think I'll ever like their burgers and thank goodness they aren't in Champaign)!  Meatheads is probably the best fast food burger in C-U,  but not as good Farren's or Black Dog.  I paid a little over $8 for a lil meathead, cajun fries and a drink!"}
{"text":"Who knew someone reads this stuff? After my last review I was contacted by Mr. Sanders from the home office marketing department (shouldn't he be marketing chicken?) he was very unhappy about the experience I had and in short he said he would get that taken care of. He later invited us to please give them a second chance. So on the 2 June we did and the staff and the cleanliness had not changed still top end. But the food, it did change for the better our burgers and fries and chicken sandwich were all cooked and put together very well. Unlike last time this time my burgers were juicy with nice flavor and had the toppings I ordered, the chicken was hot juicy and well seasoned, the fries hot and fresh still a little heavy on the salt for my taste but nothing like last time, we ate them all this time. Maybe I'll ask for them with no salt next time. Over all a big impovement and we will be going back, hope there is no backsliding. We went at similar times both trips about 3:30p.m. on a Sunday and a Saturday very slow both times so it did not get better or worse do to number of customers"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Meatheads for the first time this evening. They did a great job remodeling the building. However...  Our order was taken promptly, we were seated promptly although the tables were really close together and we felt like we were setting with six other people at our table. Even though the good folks setting on either side of us were pleasant and courteous, the seating did not make for a comfortable dining experience.  I had a third pound meathead burger with all the fixings, a regular fry and drink. Our order was ready in supersonic record setting time and was brought to our table by a server. The burger was tasty and I really enjoyed the fresh cut fries. However...  I understand turnover is important, especially on a busy Saturday night, and management wants to push as many people through the line as possible, but be reasonable. I have never felt so rushed or pushed to finish my meal as I was tonight at Meatheads. It was ridiculous! I barely got my last fry into my mouth before someone was hovering over me wanting to clear the table (and have me leave).   Maybe it would be different say at 3:00 on a Tuesday afternoon. Maybe someday I'll find, or maybe not."}
{"text":"So, we gave it another try!  This experience was so much better than the last!  The burgers were not greasy, they stayed together on the bun, and the taste was exceptional!  I don't know what changed, but I'm very glad it did!  I commend this place on their customer service, and their attitude to \"make it right\".  Taking customer feedback is a huge part of running a business, so thank you!"}
{"text":"Just went back to MeatHeads. Love going there for their burgers and fry's. they have added Turkey burgers to the menu now. You get two turkey paddies with the same extras that you can get with the burgers. Turkey was cooked perfect. Really good, and I love the fries."}
{"text":"I liked it. Despite some not so positive reviews, they have a really good burger joint here.   Found the place to be immaculately clean. Even the mensroom was spotless.  A lot cleaner than most of my recent Five Guys visits that had peanuts all over the floor, and garbage on top of the tables (China Town DC--you know who you are!).  They kill you with too many fries, the burgers were good, very tasty and cooked to perfection, but my work colleague said his burger was too small. I felt my 1/2lb burger was appropriately sized.   Service was friendly and fantastic and a manager-looking guy even bused our table.  It's great to see a burger place like this offer a drive thru window."}
{"text":"This is not the place for the best burger in Champaign. BUT - they do make good burgers! I don't love fries so I won't speak to that. They have great toppings that don't cost anything extra when creating your own burger. If you're not sure what would be good, they have some favorite creations that you can choose from that are all pretty solid.   If you have kids, they have a reading program where your child(ren) can get a free burger every time they read 5 books! Wonderful program and this is where we do a lot of dinners with friends from school."}
{"text":"Great burgers....check Really good fries...check Outstanding friendly and attentive service...check Management that actually cares...check Comfortable seating...oops (outside seating)  I had the Texas ranch burger. She had a cheeseburger. We shared regular fries and had more than enough. I'd put it a notch above 5 Guys on the strength of the burger."}
{"text":"This is one of the best place for food I have ever been to! The people working are very nice, the food is awesome, it is very kid friendly. They get your order right very time. There is lots of parking and space in the building. For the kids if you read 5 books you get a free meal. I would recommend this place for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Decent burgers but for the price you can get better in town.  The best reason to come here though is the cheese fries.   Their cheese sauce is uhhh-mazing!    The staff is always very friendly and the atmosphere is welcoming and clean.  We eat here from time to time but since it ends up running about 30 bucks for two people we go here sparingly (or when we crave those cheese fries!!)  I love that they give you sea salt grinders amd pepper grinders insteaf of the ol stuff we are all used to.  Nice touch."}
{"text":"After several attempts at local deli's; all of which were closed by the 6:30pm hour, I decided on Meatheads and to try out their drive-thru. The menu is pretty huge and for a burger place they had so many options, plus there were melts and salads. With so much to choose from, I decided on their Cajun Burger. Let's talk about ingredients- they were so fresh and delicious! Those jalapeños, WOWZERS burning trousers: they were hot! I loved the Cajun burger. I did wind up giving away my bacon- which was difficult; the struggle was real... I also had the fries, though a little crispy, were really addictive. The lady at the drive-thru window was super amazing and she had a fantastic personality A+++ wonderful. Perhaps because it's gourmet burgers the total was $10.51, I didn't even order a drink, and was genuinely surprised. The food was very delicious but $10.51 for a burger and fries is a wee bit, in my opinion. I think I would've been more comfortable with a drink being involved in the total, which is why I stingied out on the 5th star. However, very yummy, great service- I will be back to try more burgers."}
{"text":"Not to bad. Love the egg nog shake and the Apple pie shake! Chili cheese fries are good. Burgers are good. But still nothing compares to an In N Out burger on the west coast"}
{"text":"I thought I had found my 5 Guys fix but was a bit disappointed.  We ordered 2 cheese meatheads with a regular fry and a vanilla milkshake.  It was definitely a step up from the typical fast food chain but lacked the addicting lure of 5 Guys.  Maybe we just got a bad batch but I wouldn't order the fries again.  They appeared to be shoe string size but the only ones that were crispy were the really small fries.  The drink machine was cool but no Birch Beer!  Pricing was similar to 5G's but MH gives 10% back to the community!  Decor and staff were excellent."}
{"text":"There's not much you can say about this place, I usually stop in or go through the drive thru once a week. I typically get the grilled chicken sandwich because it's convenient and delicious for someone who counts their macros. On days where I allow myself more freedom I go for the burger and fries. Bistro sauce on the side is where it's at. Service is always 10/10 everyone is always beyond friendly and seem to actually enjoy being at work there."}
{"text":"We come here very often and it's always so good. It's the best Meatheads location we've been to. The fries are always perfectly done and the service is excellent. Clean, efficient, delicious, and really fun spot to sit outdoors and enjoy a burger now that the weather is cooperating!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. I get the Cajun Sunrise burger most of the time! Also, order kid sized fries because regular may be a little too much for most people. The serving is still a lot for \"kid-sized\"  However, it seems they get new people staffed every so often which slows down the speed of my order because they are training. But everyone else working there is so nice and friendly!  All in all, I really love this joint!! I frequent it and leave satisfied every time."}
{"text":"I saw this place at 10am in the morning while I was on my way to Charleston, IL and made a small footnote to stop in on the way back.  I pulled in around 2:45pm and the place had a good crowd in it.  I have a fondness and a weakness for a good burger...must...stop...in!  The place was clean, the staff was professional and patient while I ordered.  I went with the 1/2 pound Meathead, Cheddar, Mayo, Ketchup, Mustard, Lettuce, Tomato and Applewood Smoked Bacon.  Hey its not fancy but I like the combination.  I ordered a large order of fries and was warned, I went with the small.  I also ordered a vanilla shake, I'm out of town I miss my girls and needed to eat my pain.  I forgot to order my burger medium, what I got was absolute perfection.  The burger was like cotton candy, it melted in your mouth.  The river of fries were at the height of crispy perfection and the 'nilla shake, wooh!  Over 11 hours later, I haven't been able to eat another thing, just not hungry, that was a good burger, as good as it gets!  'Nuff Said!"}
{"text":"Delicious. I got the salad to go with my huge burger and it was a lot of food but yum."}
{"text":"Good food, great service last time I was in here. The young lady greeted me with such warmth. She was just radiating happiness. I'm sitting here mid review before I even got my food when she brought it to me, double checking that I didn't need anything else. Keep Miss Brea around!"}
{"text":"If you like grease come here but man there is soooo much grease on their sandwiches. You get your food really quickly and the place is pretty clean. Overall I say it is a decent burger place."}
{"text":"Great burgers! I am not a fan of anything else on their menu but the burgers are worth going here."}
{"text":"Delicious food and the service was just as great! Even though it's not really a sit down the cashier kept checking on our table asking if we needed anything else. You get an enormous amount of fries for $3.50 that can be shared between 3 people!! Yum!"}
{"text":"I don't go for fancy dancy burgers, like wasabi or fried egg and weird flavors. But if you like that, they have it at Meatheads.  There are tons of choices to put atop your burger. All fresh.   It's an adult  fast food atmosphere.    I like the regular old cheese burger, so I got a 1/3 lb. burger, which is two thin   patties. All in all, it was tasty, it was almost everything I wanted in a hamburger.  Fresh ingredients.  The patties are fresh, never frozen, as per the manager.  It was very tasty and our order came out fast, and the staff was friendly, the place is clean.   The fries are really good.  Crispy, thin (but not too thin) and salty!!!  I'd go here again for a quick burger.   UPDATE: I had a nice email from the manager, I would patronize this place again because it appears he CARES!!!"}
{"text":"Meh. Ultra clean and super super friendly earns them two stars. Food only one star. Greasy and not very flavorful. The soda machine is fun, and so is the location - you can sit by window and watch traffic whizzing by on Neil Street. But I'd rather go to Culver's."}
{"text":"I ordered:  1/2 Pound burger with: ketchup, mayo, fresh jalapeño, grilled onions, lettuce, relish, with fried egg! Chili cheese fries!   Customer service: Excellent (5) Cleanliness:  Very Clean (5) Foooood:  Tasty (4)  It's in the same category of conversation with the Shake Shack, In and Out BUT...  It falls a bit short.  Burgers are great and Chilli cheese fries were okay. I would recommend this place in a heartbeat!  Must go and check it out!"}
{"text":"Friendly fast service the food is always fresh and hot it is a little bit on the pricey side but the food is absolutely great and it's worth every penny"}
{"text":"I am very pleased with the follow-up I have received about the urgent issue I contact Meat Heads about. I will return to meat heads and recommend them to positively to friends. Although I am still unsure about some employees .. I do like the food and the awesome soda machine!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to get a burger! Very fresh! Love the cajun fries... most friendly staff around"}
{"text":"My order: Texas Ranch burger, bacon cheese fries, Gourmet Edible Cookie Dough  Meatheads passes the eyeball test. A typical dine-in aesthetic of what you would expect of a higher-end burger spot. The true value comes with the menu. Meatheads had a seemingly endless amount of combinations - burger/chicken/hot dog, cheeses, free toppings, signature sauces, and so on. Kids' options, deserts, and shakes round out the menu.   The biggest fault I found with Meatheads is the food. The portions were satisfying, and the quality of ingredients is on par, but my food came out lukewarm and my burger fell apart immediately. The burger was bland (even with all the toppings) and wasn't worth the price, but the side more than made up for it in the form of a sizable plate with perfectly cooked fries. The Gourmet Edible Cookie Dough was a good change-of-pace dessert.  As a competitor to the local Five Guys, it's cheaper with more options, and has the experience of customizing. Overall, I'll be giving it another try in the future."}
{"text":"I brought my husband to Meatheads for lunch on his birthday.  He was super excited so we \"splurged\".  He ordered a \"Build Your own Burger\": half pound burger (which is actually 3 small patties stacked) and a fried egg on top w/ swiss cheese.  He loved it.  We had the Chili Cheese Fries and they were delicious.  I think the previous reveiwers who had Take Out...maybe didn't get the full experience like you do with dining in....because I would rank the Chili Cheese Fries at top of my list.  I had the Texas Ranch burger and enjoyed every bite.  We also had a Mocha Shake which was very rich and delicious, though my husband thought is was very \"coffee\" flavored (um, that's the point I thought but was happy to drink more of his share). Oh, and I love the fancy soda dispensers ...they are the electric ones where you can choose a flavor to go with your soda choice...totally fun."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago and while it was decent, it seemed like a wannabe Smashburger but without the great taste. If u've been to Smashburger, stick with it. Avoid this place, it's all hype!"}
{"text":"This place is to expensive for what you get. The food is slow.  It's disgusting.  Just pass"}
{"text":"They have some nice burger choices and a few good add-ons for their fries. The quality of the burgers and fries is good too. I'm not entirely convinced the quality is worth the price, but it's a good choice if you're looking for a burger that is better than fast food chains and cheaper than a dine-in. Having a drive-thru makes it even more tempting."}
{"text":"I stopped by Meatheads one weekend and while I had fun, I wasn't blown away.  I ordered a cajun, which was a solid meal for one.  The burger came with egg + fresh jalepenos (delish) + cheese, etc. hold the bleu cheese sauce.  Everything was nicely spiced and season, but the egg was a little overcooked and the patties were on the dry side.  For ~$7/person, my sister and I had a solid OK meal."}
{"text":"We ordered the Hawaii burger (with bacon pineapple jack cheese), chili cheese fries and shake?A little lower than our expectation... But better than normal burger in some fast food restaurant!"}
{"text":"Jason offered us great service!  We pulled up 2 minutes after closing and they still prepared our food.  I love when you're valued as a customer!"}
{"text":"Does what it tries to do perfectly.  5 guys has better burgers, and [insert favorite fry place] has better fries, etc etc. But meatheads is the one place where you can go and satisfy everyone in your group. Very good burgers, above average fries, awesome shakes, but also dope salads. They offer lettuce wraps which ia great for gluten-free diners. The environment is always clean and the staff is so friendly.   If you want to get the best burger you ever had, go to Farrens. If you want the best shake you every had, go to an ice cream shop. BUT if you want a very good meal and a variety options quickly and affordably meatheads is the place for you.  Really nails the fast-casual concept. 5 stars given within that context."}
{"text":"Yum! Man I love some meatheads! Best burger I've had in a long time! I love the selection of different condiments and cheeses and I love the freestyle coke Machine. Plenty of seating room, is good for big groups. And my favorite thing about meatheads is the fresh cut fries that are always hot when they hit the table. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Over rated steak n shake ripoff. Plus more expensive. By 2 to 3 times as much depending on what you get.  If you want a $10 burger and fries then go to Farrens where it'll be amazing.  ETA: Probably a bit overly harsh. I forgot they also are very gluten-free friendly, so that does improve things and justify some extra price."}
{"text":"Best burger and fries i've had in Champaign area. Comparable price to Five Guys but better all around and faster service."}
{"text":"Man, this burger will haunt my dreams. We came across this place while we were in town for friend's wedding and we could not have been more impressed. I loved the warm, friendly staff and the fast arrival of our food. To top that, I loved the juicy burgers and chicken tenders (probably the best I've ever had - seriously!). It really hit the spot for dinner. My only wish is that you would expand out and create a location in California! Love this place and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"When I first arrived, the line was out the door which I thought was both a good sign about the food and a sign that this might take a while. But the cashiers were speedy and maybe the customers were decisive as well.   The concept of this place is similar to that of Chipotle--you pick what toppings you want on your burger or you can choose one of their predefined burgers.  I went with the second option and ordered the californian with regular fries and a drink which came to a total of just under $12.  Kind of a lot for a meal at a fast-food like place but I was hungry so whatever.   My meal was pretty good and there was a ton of fries in the \"regular\" portion.  They were thin and crispy as well which I loved.  The burger itself was good, it did fall apart a little bit when I tried to eat it, but there were a good amount of toppings so that was predictable.  I was disappointed in the amount of cucumber wasabi on my burger as I was really looking forward to that.  I feel like I only tasted it in one bite.  Instead I just added some of the specialty spicy chipotle kethcup available which was delicious and this is coming from someone who doesn't even like ketchup and eats her fries dry.    They also have Coca-Cola freestyle machines were you can pretty much have any Coke drink imaginable so that's cool. It also means the person in line behind me gets irritated because I like to check out all of my options before making a decision."}
{"text":"We have been to Meatheads in both Champaign and Bloomington. Both times it was delicious! The burgers beat the heck out of Five Guys, and the fries do too! Especially the cajun fries! And you MUST try the cheese sauce for dipping...yummy and a little spicy. The milk shakes are for real, too.   Great, now I'm hungry..."}
{"text":"Both our burgers were great, service was great everyone was super friendly. Only major issue is the drinks station is super crammed into this tight space and it was annoying simply trying to get a lid for our dri"}
{"text":"Ordered a 1/3lb burger with Cajun fries and it was the best burger I've ever had. Service was great and the different types of ketchup really sold it for me. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is decent, but too expensive. I do like the custom burger option. The quality is equal to that of 5 Guy's and the prices are similar. The atmosphere is better, though. The restaurant is always clean. I don't like their milkshakes."}
{"text":"The food is just really meh. The veggie melt was alright, but too sour.  The fries were really not that great. Their burgers are decent, but they charge you $2 more for cheese.  Close to $5 for a milkshake. This place is way overpriced for the quality and taste of the food you are getting. I'd rather head over to black dogs and call it a day.  The girl who takes you order also look like she is super ready to get off work."}
{"text":"If you want something other than Five Guys, this is a great alternative burger joint. You can get 1/2 or 1/3 lbs. burgers. They also have a chicken sandwich as well. They have an array of toppings/sauces you can choose from but if you bacon or and egg it'll cost $1 more. There fries are great as well because you can top them with chili cheese, bacon cheese, or even make them Cajun flavored.  When I walked in it was pretty slow but the cashier was very nice. My friend and I ordered burgers and the cheesy bacon fries. We got our food and my only complaint is my friends customized burger order was wrong, and from how slow it was it should of been correct. Overall, food was great but service in the kitchen should of been spot on based on how slow it was and how much I'm paying."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's a bit provide than the average fast food burger joint, but the food is so much better. I'd argue that the food is better tasting than most sit-down burger places in C-U. Perhaps more importantly to someone as dorky as I am is that they regularly cycle their Chef-inspired burgers off the menu, but they'll still make them; as a result, I've literally been ordering from the \"secret menu\" for months. Ask for the Goulden with Cajun fries--you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"First off the Cajun Fries, Hawaiian Chicken, and Cajun Sunrise Chicken is my fav meal in town. Secondly, I went there today through drive thru today and ordered the Cajun Sunrise and I always order chicken. I noticed once I got back to work it was hamburger. I called in and they not only credited me but they brought the sandwich all the way across town even though I insisted they did not need to do that. They went WAAAAAY BEYOND satisfying me. The customer service/management hands down is the top 5% of anywhere I have ever been."}
{"text":"Their grilled cheese & veggie melt with Cajun fries are to die for! I got a grilled cheese with 3 different types of cheese. The veggie melt with everything including avacado is amazing! Always! Always get the Cajun fries! They also have edible cookie dough for $2!"}
{"text":"I love a good burger. Meatheads, a casual fast-food joint, offers burgers your way with endless options to customize the cheese and other condiments for your meal.   My half-pound patty came out cooked perfectly and incorporated a very good quality of beef. The hand-cut fries were tasty although they were too thin for my taste. While I enjoyed my meal I felt the cost was a little more than was justified by the experience. Good but spendy for what you get."}
{"text":"Luv the burgers and cajun fries! So yummy with malt vinegar too! Great food and clean restaurant!"}
{"text":"As an update re: my last review, I was contacted by regional management and was asked very nicely for specifics about why our experience was unsatisfactory.  After voicing my complaints, I was offered a generous gift card ($25) for my feedback, which was not necessary but we appreciated it.  We've already used it, and the service experience seemed better this time.  While it's still a bit steep price-wise, I do like the burgers and it's comparable to several other fast-food places in town.  Just want them to get the credit they deserve for following up so quickly to my relatively unknown Yelp posting to make things right."}
{"text":"First time ever I was disappointed in the service. They did not give us a number nor receipt, mixed up our order, and made us wait 20+ minutes to receive room temperature food."}
{"text":"Really liked this place. I'm not big on burgers unless...it's decked out and dressed up with options like this. Had the whichever one had guacamole on it and it was so good. Edible cookie dough....yes please!!! I was super excited to see the edible cookie dough here! Will be back."}
{"text":"Very good burgers, but a little on the pricey side I think. The fries are awesome, especially with vinegar."}
{"text":"Excellent food, good service and everything is reasonably priced.  The burgers are in good size, and the fries are perfect. Don't miss their apple juice!"}
{"text":"What can I say? It's a good burger the way you want it. Staying in town and decided to get a quick burger. Meatheads back home is a reliable place to get a good burger. This place did not disappoint. Service was great, too. They even gave me information how to port over my old points to their new point system."}
{"text":"It was OK; nothing great.  I thought it was expensive & the seating capacity not good.  I was there during lunch hour and they had \"Reserved\" signs on all the tables.  I asked the manager why were they all reserved.  He said they do that because it gets crazy during lunch so they will seat us!?  WTH?  Tried it once & that was enough."}
{"text":"Meathead's is a dependable burger spot that comfortably sits in between the upper end fast food of Wendy's and the local sit down offerings of Farren's, etc. While the patty itself is not quite as good as Five Guy's, the topping options put Meathead's ahead, in my opinion. I love the Texas Ranch burger (bacon, cheddar, BBQ), and the option to add a fried egg with the Cajun Sunrise is top notch! Also, the awesome soda machine and delicious chipotle flavored ketchup are fantastic additions! My only complaints are that sometimes my burger is a touch too greasy, and the cost is maybe $1 or so more than I would think appropriate. But never enough to prevent me from looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch after avoiding this meat themed restaurant assuming there would not be options for my vegetarian lifestyle. My husband wanted to check it out and he assured me there were vegetarian items on the menu. There are a few vegetarian sandwiches and salads on the menu, and I tried the Veggie Melt. The sandwich was classic comfort food, very cheesy and filled with peppers and mushroom. The cheese was more cheese sauce than grilled cheese, which I would have preferred.  Aside from the food, which was comparable to fast casual sandwich shops, what stood out to me were the employees. As an employee brought me my food, he inquired about my meat less choice and suggested I try a vegetarian sandwich not on the menu or simply order whatever veggies are on their menu as a sandwich and they can make it. When I was ready leave, another employee came by to bus my table and asked about the Veggie Melt. She mentioned that they were thinking about changing it and wanted my input. Both of these interactions occurred during a busy Friday lunch rush. This place seems to be very well run and they seem to really tangibly care about the customer experience.   I will definitely be back and assume that food, especially the vegetarian options, will be even better."}
{"text":"This is an okay burger place. It's a bit pricey. The fries are okay. Not much else to say."}
{"text":"Got a kids meal burger & fries- plenty of food! Good alternative to the 1/3 or 1/2 lb burgers they offer. They have some of the best fries, love the customization of toppings & the variety of sodas! Burger was missing something... Not sure what it was, maybe i just prefer five guys... Overall, fantastic food!"}
{"text":"This place's burgers remind me of Five Guy's with more options. I'm impressed with many of their burgers, and my kids have enjoyed the chicken, too.   I'd put their fries up against anyone's. The only restaurant that has better fries anywhere is Arthur Bryant's in Kansas City.   I'm as pleased as I can be that they have a reading incentive program for kids. My kids are actually doing this and enjoying it.   As others have mentioned, the freestyle drink machines are great. So what's not to like?!  Did I mention my 5 year old likes to call them \"Beefheads\"? That's worth the trip by itself!"}
{"text":"I like the burgers and the options on the soda machine. It is worth the little more you pay over a comparable burger somewhere else."}
{"text":"Family friendly, great service, fast and hot food.  Lots of options for toppings and a juicy burger!!  Cajun fries are crispy with right amount of kick.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with a double w/cheese pickle onion and tomato  and a small Cajun fri with a small drink, the sandwich was good nothing special and the fries were limp all at the cost of $11.50, I could have gone to Steak and Shake got same thing for half the cost. I was also the only person there. Meatheads is good but not great at $11.50."}
{"text":"I ate at Meathead's twice. The first time I ordered a burger, fries, and a drink. The total was about $9, so I expected a burger and fries for two, and the portion was huge. It looked really good, with fries overflowing the basket. The burger looked great...until I took a bite. I waited for some flavor, but it never came. On to the fries. Fresh cut, looking good...but tasted burnt. I was sitting close to a couple who I overheard discussing the food, and their thoughts were the same. The burger was tasteless. On my second visit, I ordered a Chicago Dog and fries. The dog was a footlong, but it also didn't have the snap or the meat flavor I expect in a Dog named Chicago. The fries were the same, huge portion, burnt tasting.  C'mon, Meathead's, man up. What's with your beef? It's can't be that hard to buy beef worth the prices you charge. When I occasionally eat at Mac's, I get a double with nothing on it, and even at Mac's, the beef flavor shines through. Five Guys will be here soon, and I'm hopeful we'll have a great burger in town. But I'm not counting on it. \"Under promise, and over deliver.\" I think with franchise prices what they are, corners are often cut."}
{"text":"Love the Cajun fries, spices are perfect.   Cajun Sunrise burger is a must try, the bun was soft and the egg was the perfect addition.  Plus, easy parking and an awesome staff: the guy fixing the soda machine was singing while he worked. =)"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Years ago, I ate delicious burgers, cajun fries, and milkshakes here, but due to a health condition I am now gluten and dairy free.   Fortunately, Meatheads has got me covered. I said I was gluten free and they offered to clean their work areas, and they have a dedicated fryer for french fries (NOTE: the cajun fries are not GF). I had a burger in a lettuce wrap, and most (all?) of their toppings and sauces are gluten free as well. The food was as good as ever.  I also noticed the manager walking around and checking on people to make sure they were satisfied, very good service."}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed with these guys. Great service and clean environment. I always get a 1/2 lbs burger with cajun fries. Beware as the large cajun fries could probably feed three to four people. Drive-through is much slower than regular fast-food places, but still worth it."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a genuine American cheeseburger this is the best place to go in Champaign. All in all the resteraunt featuring a coke freestyle machine has an atmosphere that makes you want to come back."}
{"text":"We were there today, we were served by a very friendly guy at the register. The service was great, and the food was awesome. We will definitely go back :) and I strongly recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"The only fast food choice you should even consider in Champaign. Nearly leaps into sit-down restaurant status. Quality ingredients and a wide variety of choices make this a destination heads and shoulders above the rest. The staff is always friendly and very helpful.  John was a welcome smile for my late night drive-through purchase. He encouraged me to come back to try the milkshakes. I definitely will include that stop on my next Champaign trip."}
{"text":"I went there craving a burger but because I wanted something fast. I opted for the chili cheese fries to go. Something told me that I wasn't a good idea to take that on the road...  The place looks super fab. It was very clean, earthy, and urban and not some hole in the ground. When I got my order, I got a heaping order of fries. They were separate from the chili, cheese, onions, and jalepeno peppers which were in small containers. They're not McDonalds kinds, more like Five Guys (with the skin on it), which I am not a fan of. Alone, the fries were bland and underwhelming. They were also not super fresh. The cheese sauce was okay (I was expecting something similar to nacho cheese), and the chili was actually pretty good, though, given the amount of fries I had, I was surprised at how little I got.  It's definitely not something that I would order again, though I'd love to try a burger there."}
{"text":"Our favorite burger place in Champaign. Great burger and fries. My favorite combination is Hawaiian burger with cajun fries. The fries portion is quite big, which could be enough for two. Beside the food, what makes us keep coming back to this place is its staffs - very friendly with smiles always on their face. Highly recommend when coming to Champaign!"}
{"text":"All great experiences at Meatheads! The burgers are great, and their fries are the perfect combo to go with the burger. Try the cajun fries if you like a little extra kick! The restaurant was very clean and the service was also excellent. The food came so quickly and they clean up for you right away when you are finished."}
{"text":"As far as drive-thrus go, this one is definitely on the nicer end, especially given it's location. There's really not much else around on that strip of Neil St. besides other chain restaurants.  I had it for the first time the other day on my way out of town and got the Californian, a burger with avocado and this amazing wasabi cucumber sauce. It was pretty tasty. Definitely not lean by any means, but hey, it's a freaking burger.  I will say that I did really like the little high school football scoreboard on the wall. I appreciate the interest in community. The servers were really nice too and the fries were pretty good. The soda machines were also brand new and had lots of options... and all it was a very clean, nice little place.  However... I still have a couple suggestions: -Add truffle fries. We have them at every decent burger place up here in Chicago (I'm a Champaign native though fyi) and I think it just legitimizes the fact that you're paying for more for \"just a burger\". Plus they're freaking delicious. - Add turkey burgers, or bison, or venison or something. A turkey burger is easy, and delicious, and leaner and I know I'd get it."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and service are great. Very modern and clean inside, and the staff was helpful and nice.   The food, however, like others have stated leaves something to be desired. When I pictured a meathead burger in my mind I expected a huge beef patty, and instead get something similar to a McDonald thin patty. The meat didnt really have much flavor, and the sandwich pretty much fell apart. I will say the ingredients were very fresh, and they give you a ton of fries. Easily could split a order between two people.   The coke machines are pretty cool and was more memorable than the food. I'll give this place another try sometime, but for the price, it won't be a regular go-to place."}
{"text":"I've been twice now, once for lunch once for dinner.  My burgers were yummy both times.  A burger & fries is a LOT of food.  I only had a regular meathead with cheese & onions couldn't' see a reason to try a fancy creation :)  The fries were crispy and I loved that there was malt vinegar to sprinkle on them.  I thought the service was good too.  I mean it's fast food I'm not expecting much, but it's nice not to have to clear my table and have to food brought to the table rather than standing around waiting"}
