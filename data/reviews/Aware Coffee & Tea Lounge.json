{"text":"I didn't know what good coffee was until I had aware coffee, Thai coffee and macha green tea with boba is my favorite! I come here every morning sometimes twice a day :)"}
{"text":"Okay so my first review was very bitter. But we gave it a second chance and omg, we were blown away. My girlfriends mocha smoothie was delish and my lavender milk tea was so yummy! I'm so so happy. Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"I think I just died and gone to coffee heaven.  Yes their coffees are that good.  So good in fact that I came back EVERY.SINGLE.DAY after trying their coffee.  Horrible for my wallet but what can I say...I LOVE a good cup of joe and their Canela Latte with almond milk...out of this world!  I usually need to add an extra shot of espresso, for that extra hit of flavor, but not here.  The coffeeness (is that even a word?) comes out strong and combined with the honey, vanilla, and cinnamon was pure perfection.  I totally recommend you try the Canela latte if you have a hard time trying to figure out which signature latte to order.  If you're not into coffee, they do offer a few selections of teas and smoothies.  The teenager tried their matcha smoothie and thought it was pretty good.  You can definitely taste the matcha flavor.  I also tried their mango green tea with boba.  They do add real mango puree which you can definitely taste.  Now for those that know me, I don't really enjoy drinking tea with boba.  I mean, I just like to drink and not have to chew something while I'm drinking.  But the husband ordered his with boba, so of course I slurped one and I must say, their boba wasn't bad at all.  It had a nice texture, not too hard and not too chewy.    The inside is still a work in progress so don't expect a nicely decorated shop just yet.  They have a lot more seating available vs. the first time we came on opening day.  This spot can easily be my go to spot for a nice cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Being a long time customer of Tea Time, I was extremely sad hearing about the closing, so you can only imagine my excitement when hearing about them rebranding and making a comeback. Aware Coffee & Tea is what the Northwest area needed. Their new modern decor is stunning, they have a refreshing (pun intended) outlook on organic drinks. Which by the way, the drinks are OUTSTANDING. My favorite is the Hong Long milk tea, but so far anything I have ordered has not let me down whatsoever. Richie is a beverage genius!   Side note - To those who are judging based on the \"unfinished look\", give them a break. Building a business takes time and patience, and why rush something that they are perfecting.   Can't wait to see what else they have up their sleeves, which from what we hear is going to be well worth the wait. Keep up the amazing work Aware!"}
{"text":"The inside is awesome it looks super new and fresh. I got an earl grey milk tea with almond milk and boba awesome as always! I'm excited to try more of the new menu in visits to come."}
{"text":"I was so excited to find this coffee and tea shop! There aren't too many speciality coffee/tea places in centennial. The store was very clean and minimalist looking, which I loved. I got an iced vanilla bourbon latte and it was super good- they even did it half caff for me since I'm pregnant. :) staff was knowledgeable and very nice. Can't wait to go back! The only suggestion i would make is adding some food items to the menu as well. Other than that, cute little spot and I will be back!"}
{"text":"I tried my first Dirty Thai iced Tea here and now I am hooked. This is the perfect drink spot."}
{"text":"The menu is small but appealing. I am going down the list of lattes and my first drink was the mint mojito latte. Very good for a Cali girl who misses Phil's coffee mint mojito."}
{"text":"Originally located in the same space where Time Time was situated. This \"new\" place is really great and the quality of coffee and tea you're getting at this location is delightful.   Personal recommendations include their Bourbon Vanilla and the Canela (both iced). Their Bourbon Vanilla takes regular vanilla lattes to another level. You taste more vanilla, and it's not overly sweet. The Canela latte is more cinnamon forward, and I love cinnamon! There's slight sweetness but it is a great compliment to the espresso they are using. The lounge makes all the syrups and purees in house, so you can tell that their lattes do not taste artificial.   The atmosphere is modern-minimalist, clean with a white-grey-black interior. Open bar area allows you to the espresso machine and their back bar. They do have a kitchen in the back, and from reading previous reviews it seems like they will be serving food at some point.  I would give this location higher marks but the associates in the back keep forgetting my order. On two of the three times I have visited the location they downgrade my size from large to regular and I paid for the large. I'm not one to do public tantrums, but seriously pay attention to people's orders. The associate who took my order, even said it back to me and still gave me the smaller cup.   I will still return as it is one of the better quality coffee/tea locations in my area. Though, I'm going to have to repeat my order several times to make sure they understand the size I want."}
{"text":"Same location, new name but same smiling faces. Stopped in for the first time since the facelift and re vamping of the cafe. Another cool new twist would be the handcrafted from scratch drinks they are providing. Stop in and find out what's new with your old favorite.  I got my usual Thai tea smoothie. It was perfect and long over due. Can't wait to come back again and see what else has developed since they are still getting the cafe ready. There is new seating too which gives the places a different look and feel. Come check it out."}
{"text":"First time to try today and so glad I did! The iced bourbon vanilla is soooo good!!! It's perfect for this hot weather and the taste is very smooth and not overly sweet. Can't wait to try it as a hot drink during the \"colder\" times of Vegas. I'm  a big coffee drinker and I'm so happy I don't have to just drive all the way to Sambalatte, Henderson, or the southwest area for coffee! The owner made my coffee and was super nice and informative. Will def be back again!"}
{"text":"They really dropped the ball here. The remodel has completely ruined what was once a fun and amazing place to be. They got rid of their food menu, the place doesnt even look finished, the tea tasted like a mushy watered down mango, they only have artificial sweeteners, and the whole vibe is now so unwelcoming. I gave it a chance but its so bad now. Im going to chill haus now"}
{"text":"I went to Aware today for the first time. I was really impressed with the great quality of ingredients and organic coffee and teas.  So happy this place has great quality ingredients unlike other places that offer so sugar.  Im so happy its so close too!!"}
{"text":"This is my faaaaaaaavorite coffee place in town. I come here almost everyday to get my Iced Bourbon Vanilla. The staff is always super nice, it's always super fresh and clean. If I can give them more stars I'd give them 10"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee and tea in the NW! My husband has been looking for a good place nearby to get espresso drinks. We were looking for any place except Starbucks as their espresso is horrible, but this local store is fantastic! I had the mango smoothie and it was like drinking a mango through a straw. Haven't had such a good mango smoothie since being in Guam. I can't wait to go back and try the milk teas!"}
{"text":"Best boba tea and coffee house around the centennial hills area!"}
{"text":"This is a rebranding of Tea Time, so if you're coming back and expecting the same drinks, pout about it elsewhere.   As said in a previous post, the focus has swayed towards coffee and it shows. I was extremely happy with the Vietnamese Cold Brew with condensed milk. The espresso seems to be the same brand, but possibly a different roast. It's a clean, bold flavor that has a medium mouthfeel and lingers slightly.   The staff is welcoming and quick, so I can definitely appreciate that. This store has a lot of potential. I love the industrial feel and spaciousness; overall, I look forward to seeing the growth and getting a taste of the new house-made items."}
{"text":"Looove the matcha latte! Super chill atmosphere and friendly staff. I also like that it's a great environment to study at."}
{"text":"I was not \"aware\" that Tea Time had changed over to this hip new coffee shop until a friend posted their Apothecary iced coffee on IG. When I heard about the rose and cardamom-flavored concoction, I knew I had to get one for myself. The clean lines and bare space remind me of coffee joints in SF, quiet and good for working, and the staff are knowledgeable and friendly about providing suggestions.  The apothecary coffee I had here was stellar- the syrup is made in house and they have a variety of milks to choose from (extra for coconut and almond). Despite the warming temps in Vegas, I opted for the hot drink at the barista's suggestion because he said the flavor was more developed. All I know is that I really enjoyed my drink and will be looking for opportunities to come by this out-of-the-way location again for their bourbon vanilla and mint mojito versions.  TIP: No food menu yet, so grab your coffee to go and pop by Jamboree across the street for a bagel & schmear to complete your morning!"}
{"text":"First trip here. The coffee was fantastic as well as the service. The shop just opened and on a mid day Monday there was 8 people sitting here enjoying the coffee"}
{"text":"I was looking for a boba place and came across Aware. However, I started trying their drinks from their varied menu. So far, I've tried the Vanilla Bourbon Iced Latte, the Mango Matcha smoothie, and the Earl Grey milk tea. It's nice to have a specialty coffee house nearby! The atmosphere is clean and simple, and seems like a nice place to work or chat."}
{"text":"Possibly some of the best coffee in town, I come twice a week and everything I try is so yummy! Love the vietnamese cold brew, can't wait to see if they offer any sweet treats in the future"}
{"text":"This is the best coffee shop in my neighborhood! I'm halfway through the signature latte menu, having enjoyed the Mint Mojito, Canela, and Apothecary. They must be using great quality espresso because these drinks are incredibly smooth and addictive. Flavor syrups are fresh infusions of real ingredients rather than artificial chemical flavorings. I appreciate that the hot drinks never burn my mouth, but you may want to request a higher temperature if that's your preference.  They have a variety of comfortable seating options for hanging out or working; some art on the walls would be a great addition. A snack menu is in the works, but it's just drinks for now. I'm excited to try the Vietnamese cold brew because it looks so good!"}
{"text":"The girls and I at work LOVEEEEE this place. All we've ever tried is the Vietnamese cold brew and it's just so good we haven't wanted to try anything else. Maybe one day we will lol. They are always so nice and personable anytime one of us goes to pick up the order. Definitely would recommend stopping by here to get a good drink on your way out to run errands or stay her and catch up with a friend!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy that this place is here! The new vibe is everything. I love the white walls which make this place look huge and inviting. I love the wood furniture touch. Their menu is so simple but it has everything you need; boba, teas, coffee, smoothies!   They make everything in house and freshly brewed. Their original milk tea is so good, it isn't sweet at all.. it isn't heavy either. If you are looking for something more creamy and sweet you should try their hong kong milk style milk tea! They did perfect their taro milk tea as well, soo good. It is definitely sweeter than the hong kong milk tea, but the taro isn't overpowering either. All three drinks are delicious! The owners did tell me that all their smoothies are made with real fruit as well, so glad that this place is here.  Oh, they also have a reward points from an app called Perka. Purchase 12 drinks and you'll earn a free regular one after!"}
{"text":"I was lowkey disappointed to find out they took over Tea Time but it's my new fave place. I got the mango smoothie w/boba & my friend got an earl grey tea w Aloe & my other friend got the Canela w boba & they were all BOMB. the employees were suuuuper nice & Angel was soooo helpful since we were so new to it. Definitely recommend going & trying. It's the next day & im going to get it again lmao"}
{"text":"Dammit, I normally don't like fancy teas and places like this but my gf got the taro tea and it is really really good. Its got the super modern minimalist hipster setting that everyones into today, go for it this place is good"}
{"text":"As my rating says, I am definitely a fan of this place. Mom and I stopped in after grocery shopping at Costco for some coffee. Caffeine doesn't affect me in any way so I don't drink it for a boost of energy, but I love the taste of coffee/espresso and I try to stay on the lookout for new places to fulfill my cravings. I first heard about this place while scrolling through instagram. I came here twice with my mom. She ordered the Bourbon Vanilla Latte and I ordered the Mocha Smoothie. My mom's drink came out first and as soon as she took a sip, she was in heaven. She swore up and down that it was the best drink she's ever had. I took a sip of hers and didn't want to give it back! Then when I got mine, I took a sip and too was in heaven. Gosh...it was so good. I don't even know how to explain it. I've had a number of mocha blended drinks before but this was something else and I was hooked. Second time we came, they were out of the ingredients to make it because of EDC so I was so sad but the guy ringing us up recommended the Mocha Latte (I think?) and that was good but it didn't hook me like the Mocha Smoothie did (no surprise).  Service wise, the guy who rung us up both times (I don't know his name but he's Asian) was awesome. He was very patient with us the first time we went after we told him it was our first time and he explained the menu and asked us questions about what we like to drink and then made recommendations. Clearly though, we're hooked on the Bourbon Vanilla Latte and Mocha Smoothie.   The place was clean with some seating. There was a customer there who seemed to be doing school work as she had her textbooks laid out with her laptop which was nice to see because it showed me that I too could come here to do school work ad get high on Mocha Smoothies all day. However, the space did feel very empty (and I mean differently from minimalistic) but according to the reviews this place does seem new so that would explain the empty space.   One thing I'd have to gripe about is their menu. While I can appreciate having a specific (and refined) menu of drinks, it would be nice to see them introduce a food menu (nothing crazy that would distract from their drink menu). Offering specific food items that complement their drinks could be beneficial but it would need to be done with taste (ha, see what I did there?) while maintaining the same quality as their drinks. Prices seem a bit high for drinks but I'd pick this place over Starbucks any day because of the quality.  I love this place, plain and simple, and will definitely be returning whenever I get the chance."}
{"text":"Love this place! The Mango Iced Tea green tea is so good! Very Refreshing! This is my new Go to Spot to do homework and be in a good environment. I look forward to tying out new things! The modern look is beautiful inside and gives a chill vibe."}
{"text":"I wasn't a big coffee person until I had aware coffee! Organic and delicious ! I come here every morning and every evening, they even have my favorite macha green tea with boba! Yum! The service is amazing too!"}
{"text":"I love it here! So far I've tried the rose milk tea (w/ jasmine green tea), mango smoothie, mango matcha smoothie, matcha smoothie, thai tea smoothie and taro smoothie all with boba! This place does not disappoint!!   My sisters tried the canela and Vietnamese cold brew and they both enjoyed it!!! I come here couple times a week to satisfy my boba craving!!!   Today I am trying the lychee tea with lychee! (And got a rose milk tea for later)"}
{"text":"This place was the formerly known Tea Time Cafe. They do have less choices compared to the previous but still great customer service! Their grand opening did not seem like a grand opening. There weren't many seats and the building still has a construction smell. But the positive to their reconstruction is the space. I don't believe they serve food since it isn't on their menu, but drinks are still available. Hopefully as they continue to grow, more items can be added to their menu and they bring back their Hokkaido Milk Tea.  --- Update as of April 12, 2018 - my previous rating was a four but now it's definitely a five! I tried their wild berry green tea, mango smoothie, jasmine mule iced tea, lychee green tea, and the Vietnamese cold brew. All of those drinks listed taste amazing!!! You can definitely tase the freshness in the mango and wild berry drinks and the cold brew has the perfect amount of sweetness to it.  For the space inside, they included a lot more seating and a good space to have a study group/meeting.  I'm excited to see what drinks they continue to bring out as time goes by."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday on a whim and was so excited! This place did not disappoint. I got a lychee green tea with lychee jelly and it was delicious! Decor is still a work in progress since it just opened but is looking good. I can tell this will quickly become a go to hangout spot. Loved that the teas were fair trade and that their flower teas are made with real flowers. So happy to have high quality tea on the north side!"}
{"text":"First time being here since the closing of tea time cafe.  When I walked in the door I was quickly greeted by the gentleman behind the counter.  I took a second to think about what I wanted and he was extremely patient.  I ended up getting an earl grey tea with boba and he made it in less than two minutes, great service and extremely quick.  Only down-side is I paid $4.45 for a small iced tea with boba, seems to me to be on the expensive side but I guess the convenient location to my house and the prompt service countered that.  Will be back in the future."}
{"text":"Everything is so good, drinks, furniture, music. Really happy to have something on this side of town besides Starbucks."}
{"text":"As a Philz fan girl, when I found out this place had a mint mojito latte- I knew I needed to try it! They didn't disappoint. I love this drink!!! So happy this coffee shop is in the area."}
{"text":"The other day my friend told me about how Tea Time changed their name and all that ish. So i decided to drag my GF with me to go and investigate. Im not much of a coffee drinker so I completely skipped over that part of the menu. When I found the smoothie section of the menu, only one item jumped out at me the most. Mango Matcha. I asked the man, \"is good?\" he replied \"yes.\" So I ordered it with boba because I was feeling rather cheeky. That wonderful man at the counter wasn't lying. That MF Mango Matcha Smoothie had me shook!! Yesterday I found the true meaning of life and it is Aware Coffee & Tea Lounge's Smoothies! I've never met anyone who can make a green smoothie taste oh so magical. With all that being said I am very excited to go back and try some of their teas, but only after i get tired of drinking that Mango Matcha smoothie!"}
{"text":"Favorite place for boba! Rose milk tea is my favorite but all of their flavors are delicious. They just recently remodeled too making the atmosphere a lot more modern."}
{"text":"I am a creature of habit when it comes to boba and I had the milk tea with tapioca. The man who helped me was so charming and helpful. I always ask for my drink to be 25-50% sweet when I order milk tea. He was happy to accommodate this but wanted to make sure that I knew that they already make their drinks much less sweet than the average place. He even made me a little sample so I could make sure. I loved the flavor of the tea and the hint of flavor in the boba that I couldn't quite identify.  My friend ordered a lychee infused green tea and she loved her drink too. They make their own flavors from fresh fruit.   I'm definitely glad I gave it a try. It's close enough to home to become a habit."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last Tuesday. Today is my 5th time here, if that says anything. Their coffee drinks are so inventive and unique. They make all their syrups in house. My favs so far are the Bourbon Vanilla latte (I get it half sweet) and the Vietnamese cold Brew which is really strong and delicious. The Northwest has been in need of well crafted coffee for a long time. Only recommendation would be to offer more healthy food/snack options. (Especially gluten-free items )"}
{"text":"The drinks I've bought have all satisfied me. The service is lowkey slow but not DMV slow, ya feel."}
{"text":"Best Chai Latte ever! Don't go in if your in a rush.  Perfection can't be hurried! Very good coffee."}
{"text":"This coffee and tea lounge is truly a hidden gem. It's close to tons of shopping but maintains a beautiful quietness because it's just barely tucked away, making it the perfect place to read, study, and enjoy some quiet conversation. Everything about Aware lends itself perfectly to calmness and a break from the business of each day by maintaining a simple, clean, and modern atmosphere with a minimalistic and put-together feel.  The focus here isn't placed on having the best and flashiest advertisements or menus, which sets it apart from the Las Vegas scene. The focus is truly the production of incredibly well-made and delicious teas and coffees. Not only are they delicious, they're organic and pure. The owners and employees take an extra step in answering questions about what they serve and are very helpful. As a pacific northwesterner, organic product is as important as good tasting coffee and tea. Richard was really helpful to this end, answering endless questions and making conversation light and easy. He was truly enthusiastic about what he does and that made the whole experience even better!"}
{"text":"For a new place, I'm really impressed! I got a regular matcha latte with boba, and my friend got a lychee slush with lychee and boba. The matcha latte had a really good, balanced taste. The matcha flavor wasn't too strong and it had a nicely mild sweetness. The lychee slush was very fresh and yummy, I definitely want to get it for my own next time! The boba was cooked well, not too soft and not hardened. As for the place itself, it's a very open and comfortable environment. Really clean, nice to quickly pass through or stay for a while to study and hang out. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place, and I can't wait to come back myself and try more of their beverages! Also, shoutout to Richard for our great drinks!"}
{"text":"Best coffee in town. Great pourovers, lattes, and home-blended chai. Super friendly staff. And very nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"So I've been here when it was Tea Time cafe and I have been lagging a bit since Aware has been open for a bit now but I finally tried it!  Back to what I usually do vibe, customer service, and food.  The vibe was definitely laid back and hipster. They have comfy couches to chill at and a good amount of seating. One this I really like about the interior was that all the seating is very general not just certain tables.   The customer service was super efficient and right away I was helped. The attitude was all smiles and the girl that made my drink was very kind. I asked her for her recommendation and she told me the specials.  As for the drinks, it was pretty good. I got the special - Wildberry Tea - per the recommendation of the barista that helped me. She recommended, since it was a bit hot today, to get the drink as a slush so I said, \"Why not?\" It was sweet, refreshing, and the boba was a bit sweet like I like it. Now I love sweet things but this was a tad bit more sweet than I like. The flavor was still super good just wish it were watered down a bit but overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"This was my favorite spot to get boba back when it was known as tea time. I'm so happy they are back! If you are into the sweeter milk teas, I recommend the Lognan tea. It is my new favorite tea. The employees are great at recommending drink choices if you tell them what you like in a drink. They are still remodeling but things are starting to come together. Give this place a try! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"So excited to finally have a good coffee spot in my side of town. Got the Vietnamese cold brew & mint mojito latte! If you're a fan of the mint mojito at Philz! This definitely does it justice. Bomb!! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is THE best boba place in Las Vegas/ever!! Their boba is always super fresh, the staff is friendly, the atmosphere is super chill and modern, and their drink selection is fantastic! I come here multiple times a week, and the drinks are always consistently delicious!!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy! Not only were the employees very nice, patient with us, and able to answer all questions we had, but they can make some awesome drinks! I got the Viet Cold Brew and my mom got the Mint Mojito Latte.  will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I got the canella latte and it was really good! Bourbon vanilla, honey, and cinnamon.  Proces were decent. 4.50 for 16 oz. And 5 for 20 oz. Decor was minimalist to extreme. They just finished so maybe they're not done decorating? My friend got the wildberry tea and said it was good too."}
{"text":"I am from Seattle so I'm pretty picky when it comes to coffee. They crushed it here! I had an iced honey lavender latte (half the amount, still pretty sweet!) with almond milk. It was delicious! I wish they were on my way to work, I would go everyday!"}
{"text":"My wife and i constantly loved this place even from when it was Tea Time Cafe. With it being new and revamped, they've completely grown as a business with new flavors and reconstructions of their drinks. HIGHLY recommend for anyone living on the north side of town, or anyone who loves Coffee, Tea, and or Boba!"}
{"text":"There is something really unique about their tea...it's all about the taste and you really can't go wrong with their tea. Summer is approaching and i'm glad they opened a coffee and tea place. Next time, i will order some coffee but i'm sure it will be great. The people that work there are great, love their decor and i will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Formerly known as tea time cafe, but love the rebranding and the focus on the coffee. The boba is delicious, but I think I like the coffee more. I got a Canela Latte which consists of honey vanilla and cinnamon!! It was smooth and creamy and the shots added tasted how shots should be made. I also ordered a Longan Honey Milk Tea. Its not as sweet as i expected it to be, but it really brings out the quality of the black tea that they use. Definitely recommend and is is worth a try!"}
{"text":"Super modern, but cute coffee shop. It reminds me of the ones I grew up going to in college. I ordered tea, green unsweetened, but they had so many other awesome selections. I used this location to meet up with a few colleagues. They offered their email to book that table if need be in the future. I thought that was very nice."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Some of the best coffee I've had while visiting and even better then most places in Sacramento! I was worried about the bourbon vanilla if it was alcohol related but it's based off of a place. Delicious, not overly sweet and offers different milk options for those who cant have dairy (like me ) very nice and informative baristas"}
{"text":"Has to be one of the best coffee houses in town right up there with Peet's coffee and tea, and desert roasters on Sahara and buffalo. I got the bourbon vanilla latte and let me tell you. They elevated a normal vanilla latte to amazing standards, and I now fully expect every place to have an amazing one, also don't sleep on the Vietnamese cold brew!"}
{"text":"I have now tried nearly all of the coffees, the Canela is still my favorite.  I was a little leary about trying the floral flavors due to past experiences at other places.  I was so pleasantly surprised.  The flavors are well balanced and really compliment the coffee.  I definitely recommend trying them out!"}
{"text":"This is almost the same as Tea Time - with the same owner and same employees. I do like the drinks since they're nearly the same as the original ones, but I don't like how they took out the made-to-order snacks because the spam musubi and bulgogi fries were bomb.  The place is quiet and relaxing itself with a modern interior and an instrumental pla so if you ever want to get work done or want to decompress then I really recommend."}
{"text":"Great  selection of tea ,boba is always fresh, the staff is super friendly and the place is immaculate! Definitely our go to local spot!"}
{"text":"I came here because I was a fan of the old spot tea time. I hadn't gotten around to come in for my normal drink. Today I came in for a Thai tea boba. ( the menu says SMOOTHIE!) which I asked her for a smoothie which is blended! I asked for two large sizes split into two cups with boba inside of each cup. I waited ten freakin mins my kids and husband waiting in the car and they gave me two iced Thai tea bobas in a regular cup. Which means she only half way listened to me. I should have had four cups with boba BLENDED! When I asked where were my other cups she then said she didn't charge me for two and That meant I would have had to wait another ten mins. So I said it's okay I grabbed my drinks realize they weren't even blended I wanted to ask her to just give me my money back but my kids were hot and thirsty. So I just said it's fine I didnt have another ten mins to wait. Which that alone is like what the heck. I get ten mins to wait for a blended drink, but ten mins for just a iced drink? Is like wth I won't be going back the drink it's self was wayyy over iced and wasn't all that good.  bad customer service! She didn't listen and it totally messed up my whole order my whole experience I was excited to try the \" new organic menu\" ugh thank a lot guys! Never again."}
{"text":"LOVE the coffee here. So smooth & delicious. Vietnamese cold brew is my favorite so far. The special way they brew the beans & the condensed milk gives it a unique flavor. This used to be Tea Time Cafe...but don't expect the same variety that Tea Time had. It was rebranded for a reason. Try their fresh coffee & teas!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent. We ordered 2 iced coffees with almond milk and they were delicious! Very strong and delicious. Highly recommend this place and it's great to support local."}
{"text":"You can just taste the quality of the ingredients. Everything I've tried here has been delicious."}
{"text":"Previously under a different name. Under went a remodel and rebranding. Obviously being the grand opening still working on getting their furniture and outlets set up. New menu and new items. First item I have tried is taro milk tea with boba. Had the right sweetness and the boba pearls were the right gumminess is how I would put it. Coffee and milk tea addictions can be filled here. I definitely will be back. Will update once I have had more items."}
{"text":"I've been here 5+ times and have NEVER had a bad experience.  The staff is always very knowledgeable and helpful in finding the perfect flavor. And the ingredients are super fresh. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Definitely want to see what more they have to offer. I must say going in I didn't know what to order so I looked on Yelp and ended up deciding to go with a recommendation from their employee. My boyfriend ordered the Milk Tea with Boba, I ordered the Rose Green Milk Tea.....and tbh, it wasn't my taste. I didn't think it would literally tasted like roses (since I've never tasted milk tea this flavor before). Sooo I had to reorder and I went with Vietnamese Cold Brew. I enjoyed that far better. I feel like this place is definitely study friendly and a comfy environment, it was also clean and very spacious. They sell Complete Cookies & Macarons in the front near the cashier. As well as a rewards program through the Perka app. Overall I gave this a 2. Only because I didn't originally like my first order, the guy working wasn't the most friendly, and also compared to other boba places nothing stuck out that was likeeee \"wow I need to come here again.\""}
{"text":"As soon as? I found out there was a new boba location close to my house, I went straight away!  I am from the Bay (SF Bay Area, CA) where there are? boba cafes galore, and in comparison to my go-to boba tea location, Tapioca Express, this Boba tea lounge was as good as it gets.  I normally order a Thai Milk Tea with boba?. I have yet to try their other drinks. The downside (at least for me) about this location is that they do not offer small boba and they do not have an equivalent of a Chocolate Snow Bubble (that I have noticed from their menu).  The staff is super chill. This location is not very busy... yet! I love coming here to study because? of how mellow it is, but I sure wish they had outlets to charge devices and more places to sit secludedly and bar seats with a backrest. They have a rewards system, too which is a plus! It is easy to use since there is an app to keep track of your points so you do not have to forget about getting your old-school? punch card punched!"}
{"text":"Tea Time was my go-to boba place, so you can imagine how sad I was when I heard they were closing... Until I heard that Aware Coffee & Tea Lounge was opening up by the same owners, then I was back to my happy self. I was really excited to see how the place looked and what they've added to the menu.  I think of Aware as Tea Time but the adult, mature version. I felt like this place grew with me from being a teen to an adult. The menu is definitely more \"mature\" too -- if you will. So far I've tried the taro boba (my favorite), iced lychee green tea, iced wildberry green tea, iced vietnamese cold brew, and iced mango green tea. All of which are MUST TRIES! All of their ingredients are fresh, especially the fruit teas. My favorite drinks are definitely the iced lychee green tea with lychee jelly (real fruit), iced wildberry green tea (real fruit), and the taro smoothie boba."}
{"text":"Just came upon this spot and I love the space ... and the drinks! Earl grey with almond milk- not watered down but just the right balance of tea and milk. Matcha & cold brew game on point. Milk tea just right! A very pleasant surprise ... and great customer service! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Not only are the employees nice and friendly but both the coffee and tea were fresh and delicious. The place and bathroom were clean.  Order black tea sweeten, bourbon vanilla latte, matcha green tea with boba and Vietnamese cold brew all made perfect. Also vegan chocolate chip"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for a few weeks. I finally did and I'm so happy. Richie is working the counter he is so nice with every customer and willing to answer any questions. I think I found me new favorite place to work and drink coffee and boba"}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite coffee/tea shops I've ever been to. Amazing drinks and great customer service. The modern decor I'm loving as well. Soooo happy to welcome this place up in the northwest."}
{"text":"I'm so happy this place is here. I'm tired of places advertising Tea and only having boba drinks. I proceeded to ask where they get their Matcha from and was told Japan (Good! Chinese matcha has lead in it). Got a ceremonial Match and it was awesome. Clean place and good customer service. Menu is a bit small but the quality is there!! Hope people become AWARE that boba is simply not real Tea (this is)."}
{"text":"Aware Coffee & Tea is a really nice place with a minimalistic setting. Very comfortable and enjoyable place to do some work or catch up friends. They use fresh ingredients and you can taste the difference. I will definitely be back to have a drink and do some work."}
