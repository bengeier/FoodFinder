{"text":"It's incredible they got 5 stars from the last taster.If she thinks this is a 5 star pizza I hate to see her review on a 3 star pizza.Cheese was watery,toppings was barely visible,crust was very doughy.Service was terrible and the short asian owner was rude as heck.My girlfriend just ask what cheese they used and he yelled back only the best  what do expect for the low price but from the product far from it.The prices were not cheap also."}
{"text":"Great local spot. I get delivery from them since it`s pretty hot inside."}
{"text":"We walked into this place last night to pick up some dinner. The place is small and hot, not really a place to sit and eat in at, although they do have a couple tables. After taking a look at the menu, we decided to go with one of the two pizza specials. 2 medium pizza's with three toppings on each, 2 dipping sauces, 15 wings, 1 garlic bread or an order of fries and 4 cans of pop for $21.98. The value was great and the pizzas were delicious! This is definitely my new local pizza spot!"}
