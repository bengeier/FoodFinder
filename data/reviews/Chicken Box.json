{"text":"The 3726 N. Tryon St Chicken Box is now closed & this location is now called Tropical Goodies selling Caribbean food."}
{"text":"This is NOT the original Chicken Box.... this isn't even close. I went here today for the first time since the original guys moved over to the Sugar Creek location, and I was not pleased. The service was lackluster, the chicken tasted like catfish, the okra was boring and the yams weren't cooked all the way through. My family and I were very displeased and we now know why this place is always empty."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. They don't overseason the food and they are very consistent. The food is delicious every time I go."}
{"text":"They suck to high hell. They put you on hold and practically never pick back up. I hung up after 10 minutes and then called back about every 10 to 20 minutes about 8 times and the phone was still ringing busy. The service is good once you get them so don't be hungry. Plus they run out of food alot, not just one thing, several."}

{"text":"I should have known from the empty parking lot at lunch time. I left work early because I  was sick. I thought about  comfort food and what's better than The Chicken Box?? I came to the original location expecting  greatness. When I walked in, I  noticed that the decor inside was different. The ceiling was leaking.  The menu wasn't fully working. The middle panel wasn't lit. I ordered pork chops, cabbage, and mac and cheese. Well...the cornbread was a dry slab, the cabbage was overcooked and tasteless, the mac and cheese was more like something from the Kraft box with shredded cheese on top and the pork chop was soggy.   I starting eating here 16 years ago when I started college.  Back then the food was amazing and homemade. It felt like someone's grandma was in the back. My heart is really broken. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Five stars for the FOOD! My mouth is watering just thinking about!  Awesome menu selections of soul food on steroids.  Somebody needs slapping on the back.  Wish they would publish recipe books! Located in hood central but a quick in and out is well worth the unease  of the ghetto surroundings.  Clean and well run establishment and they cater!"}
