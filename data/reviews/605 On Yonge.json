{"text":"Hey guys,
Sorry to give you a 1* but it would be really nice if you would pay Camille and I. It has been months, and you put me in a really bad place by not paying me. 

The labour board has been in contact with you and said you were unresponsive. Just to let you know this is not something that will go away but just avoiding it. It only means the labour board will move the claim up to a level 2. 

Please just pay us!"}

{"text":"Good vibe and great place to grab a drink We went here to grab one last beer before going home on NYE, the owner? Or maybe just an employee let us choose the music that played, we picked some jems, let me tell YA. Anyway, he kindly gave us free fireball shots, hence I felt I owed a Yelp review. Good vibe. Again good place for a random drink  4 stars - 1 b/c this is just based off vibe,not food or specialty drinks."}
