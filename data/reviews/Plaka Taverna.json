{"text":"Oh my god!  We finally were dragged here by good friends as part of a rotating/touring breakfast club.  We always go someplace different for breakfast on the weekends.  Well this is their favorite place and we finally agreed to go.  I would be more than happy to only ever eat here for our breakfast club again!  The food was amazing and the atmosphere was great as well. We walked in to a small restaurant with a great vibe, lots of laughter and great smells.   I looked at the menu and was torn between the Modern Scot, Rock the Casbah and the special.  I eventually decided on the special of the day.  It was a huevos candindita scrambler I beleive.  It was fantastic.  It was so light and fresh with scrambled eggs, cilantro, tomatoes and more.  My partner got the rock the casbah and he loved it.  He should have asked for more of the seasonings (which a friend got and suggested).  It smelled great. Our other friend got her standard Modern Scot.  I had a bite and it was fantastic.  It is the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had.  The bread is this soft fluffy yet toasted ciabatta type bread with amazing warm melted cheese and egg.  All meals came with their hash browns which are also amazing.  They are light, fluffy and not greasy at all.  I also had a bloody mary with no chaser and it was very good.  I'm very picky with my bloody marys and it was very good, not the best I've had (Titletown Brewery in Green Bay, WI by the way with Jacs in Madison as a runner up).  It had great spice with horseradish.   We also got a side of gyro meat for the table to share.  I could have had a plate of this as my meal.  The seasonings were AMAZING and was so juicy and tender. My partner and I actually aren't the biggest fans of breakfast, which I know.....is weird that we do this breakfast club.  But we would eat breakfast here everyday!"}
{"text":"Great place for Greek food!  I haven't had anything on the menu I didn't like, but can't seem to stray from the heavenly gyros.  Last night was the first time we dined on the patio--great for summer weather although the chairs could have been slightly more comfortable.  We've been for lunch and dinner, but not yet breakfast.  Now that they have a rewards card ($1 spent per point, 200 pts = $10 gift certificate) I think we'll have to find more excuses to come back."}
{"text":"We love going here for breakfast after Farmers' Market.  When they have specials, they are always good.  Off of the main menu, I prefer the Greek breakfasts over the American breakfasts.  Also, the pancakes are great."}
{"text":"Gyros were very good! Meaty, with lots of tzatziki sauce. Possibly the best part about the meal was how much we enjoyed the tzatziki. It had a wonderful cucumber hint with the tart of yogurt. Not too thick but not runny either. Atmosphere was neat as well. Slightly off the square, you're not far from the lake, and there is a little less bustle here than on the square. They also serve breakfast items such as pancakes, French toast, bacon, and omelettes."}
{"text":"It is a little or if the way but well worth it. Fantastic gyros. Super friendly service. Decent prices. I'm going to make this a regular place for lunch."}
{"text":"Had dinner here recently.  It looks and feels totally different than the old Clevelands.  The Plaka Combo was almost large enough for 2 people (2 pork kabobs, 2 stuffed grape leaves, rice, tomatoes, feta and olives, a heap of gyro meat and pita slices) and .  I've also had the ouzo burger, which was not as good as the combo platter."}
{"text":"Stopped by here from a friend's recommendation Good food, great atmosphere. The SoS was awesome, plus good beer & drinks for breakfast, who can complain?"}
{"text":"The is the best breakfast in Madison. The food is always perfect (we've been loyal since it was Cleavland's, but I'm now partial to the gyro-meat, two sunny-side up eggs, potatoes, and pita breakfast, which I'm pretty sure only showed up when they changed the name to \"Plaka.\")  The service is always wonderful, and there's something just great about their dining room on a weekend morning, all filled up with light from the big lake-facing windows!"}
{"text":"Coming from Chicago, I may have a bit of a bias when it comes to judging Greek restaurants, but I was just unimpressed by Plaka Taverna. Unfortunately, it's about the best (maybe only?) authentic Greek food you can get in Madison (unless you're just looking for gyros, in which case I recommend the Parthenon on State St).  The place is small and it has a cozy and intimate feel. I always love a Greek restaurant that plays Greek instrumental music in the background--they do that here. The staff is friendly and attentive.   For an appetizer, we ordered the combo plate with taramasalata, skordalia, and tzatsiki sauce. Skordalia was decent but a little bland and definitely not as garlicky as I've had at other places. The tzatsiki was refreshing and well-seasoned, and it had a big ol' kick of dill that usually doesn't come through so much; we really enjoyed that. The taramasalata, however, was not very good. The color was not too pink, so it was apparent that the tarama they used was of good quality, but the taste was off. We couldn't decide if it was too salty or not salty enough, and it was not nearly as creamy as we would've liked. In fact, it could hardly even be described as smooth. Furthermore, the portion of the appetizer was very small, especially in comparison to the 30 pita triangles that were served with it! We had enough spread for maybe 10 pieces of pita--the rest were wasted.   My husband had the gyro and I had the souvlaki platter. The gyro had the right seasoning, but the meat was extremely dry (perhaps overcooked?). The souvlaki was decent; it had the proper seasoning as well, but it wasn't ground as fine as other souvlaki that I've had. I found myself biting down on pieces of fat and grizzel and having to spit them out.   As the saying goes, \"you get what you pay for\" .... this definitely held true here. Since the prices were relatively inexpensive, I didn't feel like I got cheated on the mediocre food that we received.  I really wish I would've liked this place more. Still on the hunt for good, quality Greek fare in Madison......"}
{"text":"This place is much better than it looks from the outside.  The sign looks kind of run-down so it took me awhile to try it.  I ended up going there for the first time for dinner with 7 friends.  This REALLY seemed to throw the waitress off.  I know larger parties can be more work, but the place was only half full (mostly with us).  It was really awkward to get our seating arrangement taken care of, and all that was needed was to push two tables together and grab a couple chairs.   Everyone was happy with their food though.  I had the Greek salad with peppers, tomatoes, olives, and feta.  It was delicious, and came with a generous helping of pita.  I did eat a few salads just like it when I was in Greece.  On that same trip I ate a lot of baked feta, but sadly Plaka doesn't have that on the menu.    The drinks were a bit of a let down, I got mine at the happy hour price so that made it easier to handle.  The drink I had was called \"Athens is Burning\", which had vodka and a strawberry puree (more like a syrup).  It tasted OK (strong at first), but the puree didn't mix in very well.  One of my friend's had the \"Goddess Nectar\" which she said tasted good, but was a bit too sweet and weak (hey, we like to drink).    When it came time for the bill, it was also more complicated than was necessary.  She split it into 2 parts (though wouldn't do separate checks for everyone, which for 7people I get, but then why do 2?).    I will definitely go back to Plaka for dinner, but with less people and will skip the cocktails.    I"}
{"text":"I've had their \"Cleveland's\" breakfast many times and it is perfect every time. The best eggs and sausage breakfast in town. I don't know how they do it, but their scrambled eggs are the best I've ever had. I've tried to duplicate it at home without success. I get the same thing every time I go. Scrambled eggs with sausage, potatoes and toast with a side of Guinness. Yum!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for lunch on a whim recently, and was glad we did - this was the best gyro I've had in a long, long time. The meat was juicy, the tzatziki was tart, and the pita was warm and soft. Fries were nice and hot too - I mean HOT, like they had just come out of the fryer. Staff was friendly, and it was cheap, too. A simple lunch, but really satisfying."}
{"text":"My favorite falafel in Madison! I also love the hummus, and well, everything I've had there. Unlike most reviewers I've never been for breakfast, but it's one of my go-to lunch places - enough so that the owner recognizes me and my falafel-addicted friends. Friendly, warm service, great food, beautiful patio, yes please."}
{"text":"Best greasy spoon breakfast around. I've not tried any of their Greek specialties and feel a bit guilty about that, as they've recently redesigned the restaurant as a Greek tavern with the old Cleveland's breakfasts still available due to their massive popularity. Nice atmosphere and personal service, usually from the owner. Wonderful slice of local Madison goodness."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants for breakfast in Madison. I am not a big fan of just eggs and bacon. I like something more and Plaka II (the current name on their sign) offers more. I like there specials, but if they do not have a breakfast special, they have two choices that I really like. Try either the Rock the Casbah or the Plaka Breakfast. I really like the Plaka Breakfast the best. It has two eggs, American Fries, Gyros meat, pita and yogurt sauce. It is really good. The pita is lightly toasted and goes very well with the Gyros meat and yogurt sauce. Ann has the standard eggs, bacon and American fries and has not been disappointed. Plaka II for breakfast is worth the stop."}
{"text":"Good food but not what I expect when I search \"breakfast\". Always a little thrown off when I am wanting an American breakfast and walk into a Greek restaurant!    Nice friendly staff, just no eggs Benedict!"}
{"text":"Yummy gyros and the cucumber sauce is a good as other yelpers have said.  Prices are reasonable, portions are generous and the interior is super-cozy.  We'll definitely be returning- I'm looking forward to eating my way through the menu!"}
{"text":"If I could give them less than one star I would. The restaurant serves Breakfast until 1:30pm and they do have good food, great price range, and accept plastic. BUT there is a catch the restaurant refuses to give out separate checks for Breakfast, and on top of that they will not check you out separately either for breakfast. So you have to pay cash only or cash to the one person using the plastic, and there is no nearby ATM. My friends and I go out every Saturday morning for Breakfast /Brunch all around Madison, but Plaka will not be one of those places we have Breakfast /Brunch at!!! wow they are fools, not only have they lost our four people for business, they have lost everyone we talk to as well."}
{"text":"Still my #1 Brunch spot. Nothing beats simple.  Modern Scot breakfast sandwich is simple and perfect. And I've ordered it every Sunday since 2007! This is the breakfast sandwich America was founded on and the standard to which \"fancy places\" try to divert you away from. But if you know what you're doing, you don't need fancy cheese, fancy meat, fancy bread. The brilliance is in the simplicity and how it hits your taste buds. Your brain is like ... \"oh.... yeah.... yum\" then you follow that up with gyro meat and your brain is like \"WHAT? BAM!\"   Add side of Gyro meat (with Tzatziki sauce) - YUM!   Or we do the blueberry pancakes. I love these... there are many pancakeries in town, but none have figured out how to add blueberries directly into their cake AND have them remain flavorful. The blueberries ooze blue onto the plate and STILL burst in your mouth. *Syrup need not apply.   Blood Mary - best in town for flavor. They actually MAKE THEIR OWN MIX. Their toppings suck (2 olives and a HALF limp pickle), BUT the flavor and price make up for it ($5). You can ask for two pieces of the pickle. They also have large $1 chasers.   TIP: If you can eat meat - GET THE SPECIAL OF THE DAY! NO matter what it is! Dammit people LISTEN TO ME. If it says Lamb pie - GET IT (phyllo dough with layers of cheese and lamb sausage); If it says carnitas - GET IT (moist, shredded pork from the grill!); If it says pumpkin pancakes - GET IT (wet pancakes with slightly sweet pumpkin dough). The other day it was some kind of chicken fried pork on a sandwich (pounded pork with chicken fry breading, southern style) - GET IT! If you don't want \"eggs\", then get the special at brunch time. You will not regret it, it's the cooks' daily love to you."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast place! I really enjoy the Greek influenced breakfasts, my favorite probably being the gyro omelet. My daughters can easily split a meal which is nice. Also, the breakfast potatoes taste ALMOST as good as they were back when the place was Clevelands.  I know that Come Back Inn next door does a lot more business for brunch but I think the cheap bloodied and mimosas are the only reason why. I definitely prefer the food at Plaka Taverna.  I have gone twice now and my only minor complaint would be my Bloody Mary the second time. I thought the Bloody Mary was amazing the first time and it's one of the main reasons I wanted to go back. The second time I went it was so extremely heavy on horseradish that I could barely drink it. We were also charged a dollar more for it than we had been the week before. So how much are they? $5.50 or $6.50? Menu says $5.50 so maybe the second time they charged for the chaser (even though they didn't the first?) Anyway, that's a minor complaint and I'll definitely give the bloody another chance next time to see if the horseradish heavy one was a fluke. I've been pleasantly surprised to always be seated right away and find convenient parking right outside the door. That's a definite bonus when you're downtown."}
{"text":"Gyro meat goes good with breakfast eggs and potatoes! The restaurant was nice and quiet with soft music playing in the background. We were there on a early Sunday morning and it wasn't very busy. The gyro meat and sauce is excellent, bloody Mary very spicy. I will be coming back for just Gyro's. Nice relaxing Sunday morning kind of place."}
{"text":"While I wish there were more Greek places in town, I certainly can't complain about Plaka.  I eat here for lunch occasionally and love the sampler plate. It's huge and costs about $8.  Greek food is so healthy and delicious. You won't be disappointed.   I finally made it here for dinner a few months ago and was equally impressed, especially with the new back patio.  What a great atmosphere to sip some Ouzo in.  While I've never made it for breakfast, I have a friend that has been going regularly since the Cleveland's days and says they're great too."}
{"text":"BEST greek place in town.  It's comfort food. Homely welcome from owners and long time servers. Greek posters and magazines sprawled all over the shop, and you feel like you're in GREECE.  Food? awesome. I can't say anything i don't like in Plaka. Meats, done to perfection, flavorful and juicy tender good. They manage to get me, a no-lamb gal, to eat lamb/beef gyros EVERY SINGLE TIME I'm there. What more can I say?  Chicken kabobs, lamb/beef gyros, pita, grilled cheese (omg it's a secret dish??)  Drinks. goddess nectar for the sweet lover, best sweet cocktail I've had. It deceivingly tastes like juice.   Come if you're in the mood for comfort food. yummm"}
{"text":"Once was enough for me.  Food and portions are decent, especially considering the price.    The guy that runs the place (owner maybe) has zero customer service skills - sufficiently bad that I won't return.  While every interaction he had with us was crude, the final one was the worst.  The bill arrived with an order he double counted - he proceeded to argue about it with us until he finally conceded (while never fully admitting fault) that there were more plates than people on the bill.  There's no need to return."}
{"text":"I was looking for a breakfast sandwich around the Capitol Square. After today I will never look anywhere else again.   Simple but fantastic."}
{"text":"A couple years I had a marginal experience here.   Things have changed for the better....Been getting takeout gyro's here for the past few months....have been excellent every time.  Side fries and/or salad with the sandwich....can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Overall, I had a good experience here. The service is quick, and the food taste good for the price. Definitely worth it for less than $10.   Only problem I had was they were too busy so they didn't give me any refill for my coffee."}
{"text":"Gyros were excellent. Perfectly juicy and seasoned. Topping it with a fried egg was just icing on the cake. I'm trying to think of a reason not to give it 5 stars, but I just can't. Nothing much to tell you other than that Plaka Taverna undoubtedly serves the best gyro in Madison."}
{"text":"I've only been here for breakfast/brunch, but it is fantastic. The plaka breakfast was perfect, and probably the best bloody mary in Madison.  They have a patio in the back that is gorgeous and cozy. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The three dip appetizer was definitely my favorite part.   Everything else, though, was fairly mediocre. I got the Taverna combo, which consisted of some rice wrapped in grape-leaves, with a vinegary taste that really didn't belong, gyro meat that was waaaay too salty, falafels which weren't bad, olives, feta cheese, tomatoes and tzatziki sauce.   I mean, based off of the food alone, I would have gladly given it 4 stars. However, when the check came, we assumed tip wasn't included, as the receipt didn't include anything about gratuity.   A few of us tipped early, while the others were hesitant due to the higher than expected prices. One of the people in our group asked, and it turns out 18% gratuity was already included in our checks. However, no mention of that was given earlier, nor did the checks say anything about it.  I really don't mind the extra few dollars, but I'm more concerned with visibility. Most people aren't going to just ask their waiters if tip is included, because that's just not a common thing to do. At least tell us you included tip so we don't have to guess and doubt..."}
{"text":"I had a mixed experience, but it was more good than bad so I'll go with 4 stars.  We arrived at lunch on a weekday and there weren't many people in there.  The server was a little too busy chatting with someone at the bar to bring us water or take our orders at first.  I was starting to think that maybe I was supposed to order at the bar when he started paying attention to us.  At that point I was resolved to a 3 star review at best.  Then the food came.  I had a falafel wrap with a side of fries and it was really quite good.  I like my falafel warm and soft in the center and crunchy on the outside, and this falafel did not disappoint.  The portions also weren't gigantic, between the wrap I was satiated but not overstuffed.  The server was friendly and attentive after that initial flap so I couldn't really stay mad.  Overall I'd say it's a pretty nice place for Greek food."}
{"text":"Good greek restaurant, nice ambiance, outstanding Gyros."}
{"text":"There's a lot to like here. Fast and friendly service, good food, completely affordable. The most expensive breakfast item was $7, and that was only if you added fries.  I had the Rock the Casbah - Moroccan chicken scrambler. I thought it was a little light on the chicken and even had to look to make sure it wasn't forgotten. The pieces were small. I also added a side of tzatziki sauce, which kicked it up a notch! I wish I could take home large quantities of the tzatziki. American fries were thinly sliced and perfectly salted and fried.  My husband had the gyro omelette with feta and enjoyed it.   Nice selection of Stash hot teas. Would have appreciated a small pot of hot water left at the table.  Cute decor. Excited to return for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast spot.  Went there on a mid-Thursday morning and there was a cool quiet to the place.  Warm and inviting. In particular were the two tables in front, set before a sunny window.  The restaurant was clean and tidy.  I did not have much time to linger so got down to the business of ordering. Had to go with the Plaka breakfast which is pan fried potatoes, gyros meat, two eggs and half a pita cut in wedges and served with tzatziki sauce. The servings were only modestly sized but reasonable given the $7.00.  Quality was all a-ok.  Not outstanding but not bad.    What I really liked was the warm, homey and easy going vibe in there.  Someplace that you would like to be a regular at when you are on that side of the square.  They have some street parking out front.  I did not see an adjacent lot.  Our wheelchair and walker assisted brothers and sisters may have a little challenge maneuvering in the space but my guess is the restaurant would be very accommodating.  Definitely worth a return visit and spending some time with a coffee in one of the sunny window tables.  See you there!"}
{"text":"I've been here only for breakfast, but it has quickly climbed to one of my favorites. The prices are absurdly reasonable, and the food is good. I've brought people here and everyone has been happy with their food. Nothing crazy fancy, but very friendly staff and there seems to be a great crew of regular morning people. Down to earth and casual spot."}
{"text":"I've lived in Madison for a couple of years and just recently tried this place! We went for breakfast. They have a fun menu and the atmosphere is diner-eque but it's not a diner. The food was pretty good, and fairly inexpensive. Everything on the menu is less than $8. If you're looking for a good breakfast option, I would recommend this place. Nothing fancy, but good atmosphere and quick!"}
{"text":"I've been walking past Plaka for months and very pleased that we finally stopped in for breakfast. Strong coffee, real blueberries in the pancakes and overall deliciousness at a fair price. This will be a regular spot, and we'll be back to try the gyro soon!"}
{"text":"Food is disgusting. The veggies are overdone and spanikopita is soggy. The owners verbally abuse their employees and have done so in front of customers. Stay away."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to stop in; the spray painted sign has been piquing my interest for some time. Finally, I went for brunch yesterday, and was underwhelmed. The inside is cozy, with about 12 tables and a small bar.  I had the gyros omelet, which was pretty bland and wouldn't have been edible except for the cucumber sauce. The bloody mary had so many solid spices that it was like drinking silt - kind of gross. Service was okay - they were friendly."}
{"text":"I was pleased with the food for the price. We ordered Triafilos (red pepper/feta dip, yogurt/cucumber dip, fish roe dip with pita), lamb kabob and Moussaka dinner.  The dips were excellent; the fish roe dip was fresh for sure. The vegetables as part of the entree had a good variety, which was a rarity for dinner at that price.   Service was good. Decor was good. Not sure why business was slow on a Thurs night."}
{"text":"We've yet to be disappointed by this place. We have dined here a handful of times, once being seated outside. This seems to be the best Greek restaurant in the Madison area. Our favorite dish has become the Taverna Combo, a mix of stuffed grape leaves, falafel, rice, some gyros meat, and tomato slices with gets and olives. The only issue I have with this establishment is parking. It is on the street and sometimes difficult to find nearby."}
{"text":"Today we had a great breakfast at Plaka!  Everyone in the place looked happy to be here- There was one fellow waiting on tables who acted resentful about being at work but his snappy irritated attitude did not do anything major to us personally (though it took one star off the five possible stars he could have helped earn for his team). We enjoyed 2 Plaka breakfasts and 2 breakfast sandwiches which were quick to arrive and really tasty.  Bloody Marys with local chaser ales were goood!!! Where else but in Madison can you get a classy breakfast for 4 plus 3 bloody Marys for $36 but in Mad City....."}
{"text":"I like to claim I'm a New Yorker by birth--which is true--but even more truthful is that I grew up in NJ.  Anyone from Jersey knows that we have an extraordinarily vast and proud diner culture--almost all operated by Greeks. Every town has a legit diner, and a lot of them are even quite famous!  Now, I saw Plaka Taverna's breakfast menu and was skeptical--because it's in Madison--but decided to go anyways. Verdict? A-ok.  Negatives: Well, they charged me for coffee. Yeah, it was only $1.25, but if a diner in NJ charged for coffee, they'd go out of business. Minus points for me. The eggs over easy I got were cooked fairly well, except the whites weren't cooked all the way through. Again, minus points.  Pluses: Outstanding service, great home fries, and it had a breakfast diner feel.   The whole thing was $8 with tip. Again, quite pricey. An NJ diner this is not. The food was decent, but I'm iffy on whether I'd go back--especially at these prices, and even more so when Sophia's is a few blocks away and only a dollar or so more."}
{"text":"Unassuming exterior, comfortable and inviting interior. Small room but not too tight. There's really no comparison, this is the best gyros in town. It tastes like it's shaved from the cone to order. Not sure if it's homemade but it's definitely not the bland triple processed stuff you find at Parthenon, or other fast food joints. Prices are reasonable and they have a full bar. Haven't been here for breakfast since it was Cleveland's, but I've heard that the breakfast quality is still up to par."}
{"text":"Went to Plaka Taverna tonight with some coworkers, and we had a nice time with some great food. At 7pm on a Wednesday night there weren't many other customers - really just one man eating by himself and another that came in to place a takeout order. Perhaps there aren't as many diners because of its location off of Capitol square. However, since there were few people we got great service and great food.  I ordered the moussaka, which is kind of looked like an eggplant lasagna with slices of eggplant stacked with a tomato-meat sauce and cheese. It was delicious - savory and eye-appealing. It also came with green beans and rice, and I was quite satisfied when I quickly finished my plate, not because the portions were small, but because I enjoyed the food so much.  Our server was really nice and ensured we always had water. She explained menu items to us and helped us in making our selections. I'm inly in Madison maybe once a year to work, but I'd come back to this place."}
{"text":"Plaka is a good, but basic place to get breakfast, especially if you're on a budget.  I don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well.  The setting is Greek, but more that they have a lot of Greek style things on their walls rather than a real atmosphere that omits \"Greek\" to you.  I'm perfectly fine with that though, as it hints enough at what to expect of the place.  In addition, they have a patio area open during the warmer seasons, which is great for catching some fresh air while you're dining.  As for the service:  I'm a fan, because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks.  It's not over the top nice, but they get the job done with a smile, and that's sufficient for me.  The breakfast menu is somewhat basic, but it's executed well.  It has all of the essentials, and some items have a Greek twist (i.e: Gyro Omelets, getting Pita bread instead of toast as a side).  I'm a sucker for breakfast potatoes, and the ones they serve here always satisfy my craving.  The big thing for me about Plaka is that for what you pay, you get a very solid experience.  I've never spent less than $10 total on a meal there, which I can't say about very many other places that are actually good.  It's a great alternative for breakfast if Mickie's Dairy Bar is too far or crowded.  Overall, i'm giving Plaka a 4, because I would definitely recommend it to most people I know.  However, Plaka's not a very unique place, nor does it take very many risks.  Because of that, I wouldn't a call a place you HAVE to go to, but a place that does the basics well."}
{"text":"This is the easiest review in Madison. The food, service, and atmosphere are all on point. They take what they have and put out a great product at the right price. Check out their menu, and if they have something you like, you'll like it here.  Protip: go on a nice day in the summer and sit in the back patio area."}
{"text":"Good potatoes. Good location. Good pancakes coffee and toast. Good price good window view. It was good. Under exaggerating \"good\"."}
{"text":"Ate here about a month ago when I had an intense gyro craving.  This place fit the bill, but was nothing to write home about.  Just good greek food."}
{"text":"Spanikopita mushy with ZERO flakiness and little flavor. Seemed microwaved. Lambmeat used for lamb kebabs fatty, spongy, unchewable and underseasoned. Waitress had an attitude to top it all off. If you want good Greek food, avoid this place."}
{"text":"Cozy place with authentic Greek menu.  Very helpful staff.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Thanks for the help, Yelp!  I was looking through reviews to find a new breakfast option, and I saw that many people were happy with Plaka(formerly Cleveland's). My man had enjoyed a good greasy breakfast or two from the former restaurant, and they still offer the standby Cleveland a.m. dishes. I, however, opted for the Plaka breakfast which was two eggs, potatoes, gyro meat and pita(and of course a yummy yogurt sauce). Brilliant.  It's like breakfast AND lunch(and trust me...it's a BIG portion). The breakfast sandwich looked good, too.  Did I mention that our order was out lickety-split??? Awesome!"}
{"text":"We love this place for breakfast- good prices and good food. I clean my plate each time.  Have gone with friends and spent three hours chatting...the waitress didn't bug us or make us feel like we had to leave.  A very chill place with TVs with a homey feeling.  Defintely not a sports bar but not a fancy restaurant- just a good place with good food."}
{"text":"After opening for dinner and changing their former name (Cleveland's), I was worried that one of my favorite breakfast spots would be no more.  Rest assured, Plaka is still putting out one of the more underrated breakfasts in town.  I usually go with a breakfast sandwhich with american fries.  Simple.  Delicious.  A little greasy.  It is the perfect meal after a late night but also won't weigh you down for the rest of the day.  Service is fast, friendly and efficient.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I've eaten breakfast at Plaka every single Saturday for going on 4 years. Never gets old, never had a bad meal here, ever.  Get the breakfast sandwich, best one in town."}
{"text":"My favorite place for Greek food in Mad. The owner is just as delightful as the cuisine. I think everything here is good so I will not bother with individual recommendations."}
{"text":"Plaka Taverna is now my favorite Greek restaurants in Madison. I openly admit that I don't know how many Greek restaurants are in Madison but this one is far better than any \"gyro stand\", \"gyro restaurant\" or Mediterranean food spot trying to sell 2nd rate Greek fare. I haven't had much luck finding a restaurant that serves quality Greek food (although I'm not Greek, my best childhood friends were Greek and the family owned a restaurant - I feel like I have \"expert\" training as a non-Greek identifying good Greek food...) and Plaka Taverna hit a home run with their lunch.  I ordered the Taverna Platter for lunch which was $8.00. Pork Souvlaki (2 skewers), falafel (2 patties), a stuffed grape leaf, grilled pita, rice, tomato slices, feta cheese and kalamata olives. There was a small dish of homemade tzatziki sauce in the middle (don't let my picture fool you - I ate the olives and some of the cheese prior to taking the picture). Good amount of food for the price!  The pork souvlaki was really good. Great flavors that I was hoping for and cooked perfectly. Moist and easy to pull off the skewer. Great portion size for lunch and the price tag. Definitely what I was hoping for!  As I have mentioned in some previous reviews, I love falafel. The falafel patties were really good portions and satisfied what I wanted. This isn't the best falafel I have ever had but it definitely is in the top 15% of falafel I have tasted. One thing to point out is how fresh it was!  The other \"accourtrements\" (stuffed grape leaf, olives, tomato, pita and rice) were good. Nothing here that is going to wow you or make you want to come back specifically for but good enough to leave a positive impression. The rice was cooked very well!  The feta cheese was very good. I'd like to have had a couple more pieces on the plate! I get it that this is an $8.00 platter so understood that the price tag might prevent it.  Their tzatziki sauce is glorious. I wanted more - much more! Thick, flavorful, rich and fresh. This exceeds expectations in an extremely positive way. It may seem weird to highlight the sauce but it is highlight worthy! If you're a tzatziki fan you will LOVE this sauce!  My only two suggestions are minimal. I would have loved some olive oil on the plate somewhere (personal preference - it doesn't detract from the food) and they need to rotate in some new plates and remove the broken ones. I had a few decent sized chips in my plate. Absolutely nothing that impacts the food but one of those \"attention to the details\" things...  The interior of Plaka Taverna is fantastic. Clean and inviting. It definitely delivers a message that you are going to eat Greek food! The whole vibe is friendly and the service was top notch. The bar area looked like a great little spot to share that is probably way underutilized during evenings. At lunch (it was busy) we were checked on at least 3 times and had our drinks refilled each time. Food was prepared very quickly and we were in and out in under an hour.   Plaka Taverna is a great Greek restaurant that delivers great food and great service in a great environment. I'll be back to try just about everything on the menu and definitely take up the suggestions to try their breakfast. If you're a fan of Greek or Mediterranean food I think you'll be happy with what you find here!"}
{"text":"I haven't been for dinner yet, so this is only for their breakfast. After the first snow this year, the boyfriend and I were looking for something close and cheap so I suggested Plaka. I hadn't been since it was Cleveland's Diner a decade ago, but I knew they kept the Cleveland's breakfast tradition going. I wasn't as over the moon as most people about Cleveland's, and I feel the same about Plaka. It is good, hot, and greasy - all the earmarks of a greasy spoon. If you are someone who believes in greasy hangover breakfasts, this place is for you.  I ordered the Plaka Platter, which came with gyros, pita triangles, tzatziki, American fries, and two eggs. I don't like eggs, but there wasn't really anything to ask to sub that made sense for my meal, so I decided to just get scrambled eggs (which I loved as a kid) and see how it went. I try them every year or two to see if I can get back on the egg train. Unsurprisingly, I did not care for them. Plaka's scrambled eggs are definitely on the wetter/runnier side - my boyfriend loved them and said I should always order that plate so that he can have double eggs.   The American fries were salty and had some onions mixed in, as well as a flavor I couldn't place. It was a generous portion and a good balance between crispy crust and soft interior.   The gyro meat was where it was at, which makes perfect sense being that they are a Greek restaurant. Flavorful and carved off the spit, it's exactly what I was craving and I will happily go back for dinner. The tzatziki was refreshing in its cucumber goodness. The pita triangles would have benefited from being heated - they were a little stiff but did the trick.   I'll be back for breakfast and this time I might give the pancakes a whirl on suggestion of a fellow Yelper, and I now know where to go to feed my next gyro craving."}
{"text":"Had no plans of stopping here but it caught our eye and thought we would try something on the menu. We ended up eating there and were very impressed with every aspect. Food was fresh and delicious, waitress was helpful and pleasant, and the overall vibe was very down to earth and cozy. Just had that \"home\" feeling to it that is very rare in most places."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch! I work close by but don't get out for lunch often. When I do, this is always at the top of my list. I never thought I loved gyros until I tried theirs! The salad is amazing and fresh. Service is always great too."}
{"text":"Plaka is the perfect destination for a laid back and no frills brunch in Madison. Their brunch is affordable, basic, and has some Greek options to mix it up! I've never had to wait for a table nor felt rushed to leave, unlike many other (and more hyped) brunch spots in Madison.   The absolute highlight of Plaka is their naturally shaded porch out back (referred to as \"upstairs seating\") that is gorgeous - a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Greek food roams in one of two packs: it's either terrible or it's fantastic.  Plaka's lunch menu belongs in the latter. Rarely have I ever enjoyed a perfectly portioned gyro plate and salad with such fervor. My gyro was drippy but not oozing and the salad had the right balance of olives and feta. My friends, however, won out with the platter: gyro meat, falafel, stuffed grape leaves, babaganoush, hummus. It was all fresh and delicious. True to eating in Madison, our service was also friendly and prompt.  Bottom line: Cleveland's has gone Greek, and I couldn't be happier."}
{"text":"Still the best breakfast potatoes in town!  I've been coming here for years and you know lots of the other customers have been too. This is one of the places that helps make Madison Madison.   I should come in for dinner more often as it was excellent the last time I did.   This place will always be Cleavelands to me; a place you go when you want a solid breakfast at a great price in good company, and its still true."}
{"text":"We decided to get brunch on Sunday during Memorial Day weekend. We headed over to Monty's (which I don't even like very much) and found a line stretching out the door. Eventually we ended up at Plaka, and I'm so glad we did. I had the Plaka breakfast (2 eggs, hash browns, gyro meat, tzatziki sauce and pita) and my wife had the deuce (2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 sausage patties). Everything was excellent.   Pros: + Good food: the gyro meat was especially tasty-- nice and juicy, good flavor without being over seasoned  + ample portions + very fast, very friendly service   + prices that are tough to beat: I think the most expensive thing on the menu was about 7 bucks  Cons: - it was pretty hot inside the restaurant  - maybe it's just me, but I always prefer sausage links over sausage patties - limited menu: this isn't necessary a problem, but don't expect to find anything beyond the basics (they also weren't serving anything off of their lunch/dinner menu)  I would definitely go back for breakfast and look forward to trying their dinner offerings."}
{"text":"Exceptional service and phenomenal food. I cannot get over how enjoyable of an experience it was in a whole :) i will absolutely be back, and recommend it to everyone I know!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious, but I wish they had more authentic Greek foods like taramasalata and gigante beans. It sounds like they sometimes offer these items, but I wish these items were on the regular menu. There is outdoor seating, and the wait staff are courteous and friendly. The prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"My experience at Plaka was fine, but nothing to write home about. A friend and I shared the Moussaka and the Tilapia, and had a few of the hummus appetizers. The hummus and pitas were excellent. The tilapia was also nicely prepared and served with vegetables in a very basic preparation. While I have no frame of reference for Moussaka (it's sort of an eggplant lasagna) this tasted like something you could make at home, but not in that amazing home-cooked comfort food kind of way. Mostly it was just \"meh\". To top it off, our waitress was not super friendly and I felt like we were rushed to get out of the restaurant even though it was only 8:45 when we left."}
{"text":"Loving anything that contains phyllo and/or spinach so I'm up for trying any Greek restaurant at least once for the Spanikopita or Baklava.  Spanikopita was nice, used the feta from my salad to help flavor the dish even more, which I ususally do anyway, even when I make it at home.    Nice portion size, great price, quick and freindly atmosphere, just a cozy neighborhood lunch/dinner spot, came back a second time for lunch, will return whenever I visit Madison."}
{"text":"New Greek-style incarnation of stalwart Madison greasy spoon diner formerly called Cleveland's.  Greek breakfast was delicious. Gyros strips, two eggs, some warm pita triangles, tzatziki for less than $7.  Wife and one of my kids ordered the \"Deuce.\" Yeah, the waitress dropped a coupla deuces on the table. Har har. Sorry guys. It was a good deal and tasted great. 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 pieces of meat, good price.  Coffee was good. I took a long pull on my friend's New Glarus Spotted Cow, a regional microbrew on tap here. Breakfast of champions.  Liked it a lot. Sorry I couldn't have had a Bloody Mary, which are Sundays only."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place 2 stars as the people who run the place are the most unfriendly people I've ever encountered. They seemed angry that they were busy. I tried to be nice and make small talk and they acted like they didn't even hear me. The food was average. The hummus wasn't typical at all. It was chunky and didn't have a nice taste. I have eaten at the top Greek restaurant in the world. I know good hummus. They should really be nice to the customers they get. Madison is a small town and people will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"One of my most favorite breakfast destinations.   The food and the coffee aren't fancy, but they are reliable , fast, and inexpensive. Bonus points for an entire menu page of breakfast sandwich options, and a kind and helpful proprietor.  And breakfast is still available at lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday for breakfast... Never ending cup of joe was good and hot and bottomless. Had the Plaka plate - absolutely uber delicious  gyros meat... Parthenon...bye bye.. Eggs were a bit runny for scrambled but excellent hash browns made up for that and a pinch of salt helped with that yolk flavor I don't like much. Pitta triangles a nice touch. Fresh orange juice was the perfect hangover solution. Baklava was stellar.? Can't wait to try dinner here!! Hey boy!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty, quiet, & attentive service were the themes. Plaka Gyro w lamb was the meal of choice at this gem of a find near downtown. Savory & well-seasoned meat w tasty cucumber sauce was served . The hummus & bruschetta were also scrumptious."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch here on a recommendation from a co-worker. I am on a carb restricted diet, so I ordered 3 ala carte Gyros, thinking I would be eating the filling but not the pita bread. We arrived at the time they specified and the food was ready to go. Brought it back to the office and was surprised at the large portion for the affordable price. I could only eat half of what I had ordered, and the flavor was incredible. Will defintiely be going back!"}
{"text":"Breakfast for two for under $20?  Done.  In addition to irresistible authentic Greek fare these guys have a solid (more American) brunch situation that was delish."}
{"text":"I moved to the neighborhood recently.  On moving day, I needed to make some change in order to give equal tip to each of my movers.  I walked in to Plaka and, sounding kind of helpless, asked the waitress if she could break a $20.  She understood, and helped me out.  I figured we should go back for dinner that night.  The food was pretty tasty, and they gave us a free piece of baklava and a couple drink tickets to say welcome to the neighborhood.  Nice touch.    Since then I've been back a couple of times.  The food is reasonably tasty and satisfying without being overly heavy.  I particularly like the moussaka, and I the grilled seasoned vegetables they stick on the side of many of their entrees.  I haven't yet had chance to try the breakfast menu but I've heard good things and am looking forward to it.    I'm not sure what's up with the negative reviews on the service.  I've been treated fine every time.  Seems like with both negative reviews being posted on the same day, maybe the waitress in question was having a bad day?  Anyways, I like having this place around the block, so if for nothing other than selfish reasons I encourage my fellow yelpers to give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Plaka after hearing really great things about it for a while, and I was not disappointed. My family (party of 5) came in for breakfast around 11 AM on a warm summer Sunday and were able to sit immediately in their beautiful patio. If the weather cooperates, definitely sit outside! It is very secluded with lots of greenery so you are nice and shaded. It feels like having a meal in your friend with the green thumb's beautiful backyard. Coffee and water was self-serve, which I like. The indoor seating looked nice as well, very cozy with lots of Greek posters adorning the walls. There is also a fairly long bar you can sit at. The food was delicious. Two of us had the Rockin the Casbah, which is an egg scramble with spinach, onion and a nicely spiced chicken served with hashbrowns and pita bread. My brother got pancakes which he said were amazing. Another person had the 3 egg scramble and my sister had a Greek omelet that was served with a tzaziki sauce (which I stole a little of for my pita, yum!). Three people got blood Mary's, which were good but not amazing. I really enjoyed my visit, it was the perfect spot for a laid back Sunday morning brunch."}
{"text":"Went here because my girlfriend loves Greek food. There isn't a whole lot of Greek restaurants in Madison so we thought we'd try this. It did not disappoint, it had a very authentic feel and the food was delicious. If you're looking for Greek food in Madison this is definitely the place to go."}
{"text":"Soooo meh!  The pancakes tasted like potatoes!  And the potatoes tasted like oil!  A fun interior, but the food I had was totally disappointing."}
{"text":"A very good Greek restaurant with tasty food.  I tried the chicken kabob, which was tender and juicy. The rice was very flavorful.  Also tried the gyros, and they were the most amazing I've ever had! The meat was well-flavored, went great with the cream on top. Together with tomatoes and onions, everything perfectly matched with the pita bread.  My only complaint that they are a bit slow in service, but maybe it was because there were only one person with a full room of customers the night I went. But she was friendly and kind :)"}
{"text":"I should give Plaka 1 star for spoiling every other Greek restaurant for me. It was the perfect place. Everything was delicious. There were times I did 2-a-days at Plaka; I ate there for a sloppy hangover American breakfast, and then came back for a gyro for dinner.   I moved across the country and at the end of every Greek meal I try. I put down my napkin, sigh, and say, \"Well, it's no Plaka\". Their dolmades are delicious. I could eat them like popcorn. Their tzatziki was awesome and that red pepper feta dip I could literally eat with a spoon.  I miss you so much, Plaka."}
{"text":"Breakfast was excellent. I got breakfast to go, since I felt weird about eating alone at 7:30am, but that's a personal problem. The World Cup was playing on the TV when I was there.  I got the Egg & Gyro on a pita. It was so good, and it was only $4.50. Seriously, such a great price for downtown. The gyro was really yummy. It wasn't dried out or anything. The tzatziki sauce that came with it was excellent. I'm not sure if they make their own pita, but it certainly tastes fresh and doughy.  I got coffee too, which was just kind of standard diner coffee. It wasn't watered down, but it wasn't anything special either.  Service was quick and server was polite!"}
{"text":"I continue to believe and stand by my earlier post, but I need to opportunity to comment on breakfast.  The greek breakfast: gyro meat, potatoes, cool cucumber yogurt sauce, eggs(mine have always been perfectly cooked), and homemade pita are a little bit of salty breakfast heaven.  My hubby enjoys the blueberry pancakes; filled with fresh berries, even in the winter."}
{"text":"I heard about this place when it opened up and finally tried it Today. Went with Theodore, a good friend of mine. We both had Gyros and fries for $7.75, and it is agreed that this place is the new standard in Madison for gyros. There was a lot of meat and the cucumber sauce was great, and the pita was fresh! Quaint surroundings with a fake outer window wall and greek stuff on the walls.5 stars!"}
{"text":"Feta red pepper dip is good if you don't like fish eggs switch it out for either the cucumber dip or roasted red pepper .. Saganaki was delish as well"}
