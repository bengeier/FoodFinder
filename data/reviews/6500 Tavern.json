{"text":"24hrs. Perfect place to stop and eat for any night owls out there! The food is really good. From the goat cheese pizza to the duck tacos to the chili to the hummus and pita. We've been making 3, 4, 5am stops here for years and the place has yet to disappoint!!"}
{"text":"Came to this bar for a chill night of drinking, food and gaming. Our bartender RAFA was the only person working and made the experience wonderful. He made us feel like we were regulars. We will definitely be spending more time here in the future."}
{"text":"We come to visit Sher Bear every week, multiple times a week.  She is more than attentive to our wants and keeps us coming back because she can gauge our eating and favorite drinks.  She knows our favorites and always has great suggestions.

Duck tacos, soup, chili, and the add ins weekly that make us expand our love for this place is great and notable.  

Keep up the good work and reputation with your regulars!"}
{"text":"Follow up on my review....kat is awesome and I will be back..... When she is working..... I just wish that the other bartenders where as compassionate as she is she enjoys her job and does it very well even after her horrific experience during the shooting she is still ready to work and very friendly I wish every bartender was as good as her... note to management she saved your business she needs a raise"}
