{"text":"Went last night to grab a steak while in town. I had the NY Strip and my date had the filtet tips...both of us asked for Medium Rare. When the meat came out, mine was rare-medium rare which was good, while hers was more medium. I think that all cooks/chefs that work with nice cuts of meat should be able to cook all temps and all sizes. Cheddar Mashed potatoes were good as well and the Brandy Peppercorn sauce (would have made it a touch less peppery (oxymoron, I know)

I have had better steaks in DC for about the same price."}
{"text":"Went for all you can eat Prime Rib on Monday nights. Should have read the reviews online first. The Prime Rib was mediocre at best and the six green beans that came with it were cold and undercooked. We sat at the bar and our service was good, but the food was far less than desirable. I would have gladly paid $15 less for a burger and fries someplace else."}
{"text":"Wow, I took my family and some close friends there for the first time since reopening  under new ownership and I'm glad I did! The place had a complete makeover and looks amazing! CLEAN! The maitre d' seated us within seconds of us walking thru the door and the atmosphere and ambiance were beautiful and welcoming. We had a choice of sitting in the front of the restaurant near the bar for a little more relaxed feel, or in the back for a more quaint and quiet setting. Having that option was nice! 

 The menu is new and out of this world! Our server was a little nervous but d8id a great job keeping up with us. The Steak Rolls, Fried Zuchinni, and Srimp Cocktail appetizers were amazing! They have a huge wine selection now and and the mixed drinks were a little strong but nobody was complaining   Our steaks were cooked to perfection and the quality is second to none!! The seafood and fish seletion was huge and the Lobster and Sea Bass were phenomenal! The timing was ok but that's to be expected in a real steak house and a party of 8. It was a great night with friends and family mixed with great food! 

I am a local business owner and I can fully appreciate feedback of all kinds. So, I give credit where credit is due and it is great to see this local restaurant come back bigger and better than it ever was. The new owners and chef are on to something big here. High class 5 star all the way! Will be back soon. Great Job!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been there a few time, but my last experience I have to share! We had coupons purchased in advance, but I forget them at home. So the waitress told me I can bring them in the next day. When I was there to get a refund for my coupons, I was told the manager need to do this etc, I will get a phone call. Three weeks later, manager yelling on the phone, lost my coupons, no refund of course. I don't mind paying the full amount the last time. But I would expect a better service and not loosing somebody's stuff! 
To be honest, the food
is good but nothing special - aswell the prices. Whenever I ordered the steak medium I got a different result :) It is wirtten in the menu that there is no recooking or heating... 
If you have no better idea for dinner than try it out. But Carson Street is full of restaurant where you would get better service and better food for reasonable prices..."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant for the first time tonight.  From the exterior, it looks like a halfway decent place.  Upon entering, we found it old and a little disorganized.  It wasn't clear where we were supposed to go to check in and get a table.  VERY few patrons in restaurant.  We were seated at a booth with very short benches and very straight backs - kindof uncomfortable, but not enough to ruin my experience.  We received the menu - the prices blew us away!  The selection was very run of the mill, nothing incredibly interesting, and there was not one steak under $20.  The menu itself was dated looking.  We ordered a provolone wheel as an appetizer, not knowing exactly what that meant, but it literally was a round slab of cheese lightly breaded with a sandy and oily breading and was warm at best.  It's really an odd appetizer.  Our meal itself was okay, but our waitress was hit or miss in her personality... A little gruff at times.

Overall, it's clear this place has seen better days, and we couldn't help but remark that it seemed like a good candidate for \"Kitchen Nightmares\" the TV show.  We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Steak was good but upon getting the receipt I realized this place is sneaky. Order fried zucchini, waiter said \"I brought a side of marinara\" which we never asked for, and hit us with a charge. Order a drink on the rocks, came in a small rocks glass no more than 4oz of Jameson, and on the receipt is an extra liquor charge. Very shady and 4/5oz is not worth $10/drink. I thought I was in NY steakhouse, minus the NY. Def won't recommend this place."}
{"text":"What a huge disappointment!  The steak tastes like it is either old or has been previously frozen.   It was cooked perfectly, so I fault the manager/owner, not the chef.  Green beans were undercooked, though, with too much butter.  Pasta side had awful sauce.
It took forever to get drinks, although our waitress did comp my wine since she forget about it.   She also forgot that i had changed my mind on which cut of steak to order (before she left the table) and served me the wrong one.  She asked me to try it and offered to take it back if I didn't like it.   Tried it, didn't like it.  She followed through and brought me what I wanted.  Chocolate cake was very good.  Decor is terribly outdated, but not in a cool retro vintage way.  Servers were friendly.  Owner/manager and buddies were sprawled out in the center of the restaurant watching the game on tv - not very professional.  I don't recommend this place - you will be very disappointed if you are looking for a good steak!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant a generous two stars for the following reasons: service was terrible and the quality of the food did not justify the price.

The waitress was all but totally absent from our table.  She refilled our drinks once, didn't even bring out our entrees, and only appeared to drop off the checks.  The worst part?--the place wasn't that crowded.

As for the food, I ordered a fillet, and after the menu discouraged me from ordering anything but a bloody steak, I broke down and opted for medium-well.  This place's medium-well was the equivalent of a normal steakhouse's well-done.  Don't get me wrong, the fillet was juicy and had a good taste, but the portion and overall quality certainly did not justify the above $30 price.

If you have to eat here, go for the burgers or other \"bar\" food, not the steak, which ironically, is the restaurant's namesake."}
{"text":"I went there with my bf for a new years eve dinner we dont get out much so i figured we would try a new place. we walked in and it was right at the bar we stood there 5 min before anyone even came and got us then a bus boy seated us (weird) we waited another 5 min before our waiter came to take our order she was nice but too in a rush. and there servers in a fancy resturant are dressed like bartenders in a sports bar. she took our orders then we waited there and she showed up with to small slices of bread and butter packets that were frozen! awful. are food came quick because it was preheated! we could only pick between bake potato and chessy potatos fries were an extra 3 bucks! and vegie chose was cream corn or green beans! the rice which my bf ordered was hard and nasty green beans were under done. steak was ok but VERY fatty. seriously i will never go there again. i paid 50 dollars for something i could have made at home for half that!  or coulda went ta red lobster and got twice the size meal! also there mean sucks no chicken. only chicken and pasta nothing that stands out all very bland then they ask if you wanna see a desert tray with desserts made and you pick which you want how tasteless!"}
{"text":"My wife, college student son and I ate here in mid September - the STRANGEST dinners of our lives.  We were seated, then initially ignored, as the staff alternatively met, hugged, cried and in some instances walked out.  Turns out that they had just been notified the restaurant was closing for good that very night!  Remarkably, our waitress worked hard and did her job and the food was fine.  The small crowd at the bar was, predictably, doing shots and rather irreverent.   We were the last customers of the Pittsburgh Steak Company - EVER!  

Right before we left we found another waitress dealing the stress face down on the carpet.   She said she was fine, but WOW.  We took photos with our waitress and quietly left.  We will obviously not be going back there again."}
{"text":"I would award the food three stars, but the service here was not impressive.

I came with a group of about forty people, and we dined in the banquet area upstairs. It's a very nice space, and you don't have to go through the rest of the restaurant area to access it. There are chandeliers, brick walls, and a bar. We ate a buffet-style meal that included salad, green beans, mashed potatoes, chicken marsala, and vegetable lasagna. There was also bread and dessert.

The bread really wasn't anything special. The salad had a lot of leafy greens and little else except a couple slices of cucumber and a couple tomatoes here and there. The greens weren't the freshest, but they were okay. The green beans were tender but not mushy and nicely seasoned (until the end, when the beans had been swimming in really salty water for a long time). The mashed potatoes were good, too; there were some chunks of potato which I liked. The chicken marsala was also good; the chicken was cooked nicely and I enjoyed the flavor. The lasagna was very thick and was layered with carrot, zucchini, and squash. Overall, it was too cheesy for me (especially with the layer of melted cheese on top), and I ended up just picking out the vegetables. The chocolate mousse dessert was incredibly rich. I haven't had mousse in a very long time so I don't have anything to compare to, but the small bowl they served us was way too much for me. It was, however, very light, and it included tiny slivers of chocolate, which I enjoyed.

As for the service, it was very rushed. We were there for an hour. Everything (except our drinks) was cleared within a half-hour. I would have had some more bread or maybe some more salad, but it was gone by the time I thought about it. As we left, it became apparent that they had another event after us, but the rushing had a negative effect on my experience.

Overall, I wouldn't mind having a meal there again, but only if there were no better options."}
{"text":"Definitely not above average food (w/ paying above average prices). Nothing awful, but not worth the price. Had an issue with one of my sides and they remade it for me without any questions being asked. Very good service, just not very good tasting food...."}
{"text":"Ordering a steak at the new Pittsburgh could be a BIG mistake. While the new owners have brightened the place up they certainly haven't improved or even maintained the standard of food and service of the old owners. The service was unbelievably bad, the steak was of poor quality the lobster underdone. If you are intending to try this place anyway I would suggest that you bring a good book, you could get in a few chapters while waiting for your coffee refill.Don't think that service will be any better when ordering a glass of wine I think that our waitress was consulting her GPS to find our table{there were only three tables occupied} A nice finish to any meal is a delicious desert not here. You get a description of a chocolate cake and you get some mystery cake that you never ordered. Bring some extra cash, the prices are up and prepare to be annoyed and unhappy.

{"text":"Stopped here yesterday with a friend after a spa day. Needless to say, I don't plan to return. Service was horrible. We sat for ten minutes and watched the servers all stand by the bar and talk. Finally, someone came to take our drink order. Couldn't tell you her name because she never told us it. She ended up being our server. She was horrible. She got angry and rolled her eyes when we told her we didn't want bread as she tried to leave it on our table. Really? That upset her?!?! I had the ribeye and needless to say, had no flavor. Almost tasted like it was boiled. For a place that claims to be a steakhouse, I was expected way better."}
{"text":"I was a little nervous about going here after reading some poor reviews on another website, but we ended up having a good time.  Located on popular Carson Street in the South Side, it's easy to get to (but parking in that area can be a pain).  Inside is dark and atmospheric.  Nothing special, but it looks nice.  Service was also fine.  The staff was friendly and helpful but on the young side.  I'm guessing they rotate staff fairly frequently.  We went on a Friday night for dinner but the place was almost empty.  Many of the other nearby restaurants and bars were quite busy, but not this place.  I have no idea why.  Most of us ordered steaks and they were all fine.  Nothing special, certainly not the best steak I've ever had.  For the price, I expected a little more.  I wasn't disappointed, in fact it was quite good, but for more then $20, you expect something a little nicer.  Overall, it's an average dinning experience, but nothing to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"I mean, steak is steak, you know?

Not bad. We chose this place unsure of what to expect (other than being able to find steak). After getting there and sitting down at the table, we pulled out our phones to find a bunch of bad Yelp reviews. However, our experience was all-in-all positive. 

It's an old-school steak house, so you're not going to get a cool, hip, young crowd if that's what you're into. But the food was good -- again, not the best steak in the world, but I was more than satisfied. 

If you're with a crowd that wants a simple, quiet dinner with some good-ol red meat, it's the perfect spot. 

Otherwise, if you're looking to be one of those cool guys who wears sunglasses at night and listens to that loud rock music, maybe got for the Capital Grille or one of those fancy places."}
{"text":"The best part of our meal was the fruit fly I accidentally consumed while drinking my wine. Second best was the \"cheddar smashed potatoes\" from a box. Third was the steak. Pictures and further comments available upon request."}
{"text":"Cool place on the south side. The steak salad is more than enough to satisfy as a full meal. The potato skins are decent but I wasn't a big fan of the stuffed banana peppers. The service was adequate and I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We went there, thinking it was like the \" old\" steak house. Saw each item only have one side. Then, it took a long while to get some items ordered like salads. The dressing was watered down! They put taxes, and gratuity on bill. If it's good We  Will give a good tip. Don't Tell us how much $ to give.
To make a long story short. None of my party Will Not come back here."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch on a Saturday. They have 1/2 price burgers, wraps and sammies 11-3 on Saturdays. Even if they were full price it would still be a good deal. I had the hot pepper cheesesteak with fries. Delicious."}
{"text":"To Bethany F. who posted the review last night. First off, my boyfriend and I were sitting right by you when the two of you made that scene last night. One of you claimed to be a \"personal chef\". I'm assuming that was your friend because you claim you are the \"biggest restaurant connoisseur\". If you knew anything about food or steaks for that matter you should know that if you order a steak medium well or more it dries out the steak and can make it tough. You should also know that a ribeye tends to be fatty. So my point is when you order a ribeye medium well, then complain to the server that there is gristle and the steak is tough you should know better. 
Too make it worse you wanted your meals for free, even after you continued to eat the steak. It takes a special kind of person to stoop that low. Good for the owner for standing up to you. 

P.S. My medium-rare ribeye was FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  They have a great lunch menu which includes a variety of foods - pasta, ravioli, chicken, steak (obviously), sandwiches, soups - something to please everyone.  The waiters are all very nice and the restaurant itself has a very laidback and relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Get the steak and you will be happy! 
Service is good, the other foods aren't great but it's a STEAK HOUSE and they do that right. Also the fried zucchini is great"}

{"text":"Wow surprised by the reviews.  I went last Saturday night for an early Valentine's Day dinner and had a great meal.  Our waitress was fantastic and the food came out very quickly-almost too quickly as we had not finished the side salads we ordered.  We started off by ordering beers from the draft list. I went with the Gingerbread by Blue Moon and the waitress offered a cinnamon sugar rim-they get a start just for that.  For my entrée I went with the petite filet which came with one side. I choose the cheesy mashed potatoes although they just tasted like regular mashed potatoes to me but still very good.  My steak was cooked perfectly and had nice flavor.  My date ordered a dish that came with small pieces of filet over a rice pilaf which was very spicy almost too spicy for him to enjoy so be warned.  For desert we went with the chocolate lava cake serviced with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. It was the perfect size after a large meal.   The place does look very fancy on the outside and not what I was expecting on the inside-had an Applebees feel to it but overall we had a very nice meal."}
{"text":"This place left me scratching my head.  

Here's this awesome looking place with super cool interior but the food is just awful.  I've gone here 3 different times thinking it was just me and now I feel like I've been fooled out of my money.  I was really disappointed with my food.  They either need new recipes or new chefs.  The service was so slow and the girl we had straight up told us, I don't eat the food here, on my third and forever final visit.  I've gone three different times of day also.  Something is just wrong about this place.

Don't be fooled by the presidential green awning, there's 10 other better options on the strip."}
{"text":"This is an Old school restaurant with a bar in front.  I wanted to go to Pittsburgh Rare, but it was shut down.  The hotel I was staying at recommended Pittsburgh Steak Company.  When I got to the restaurant, I specifically asked the bartender if they could cook a steak to Black and Blue or Pittsburgh rare.  She said yes.  So I sat down and went through the menu.  They even have a small graphic to tell you about how the steak looks for Pittsburgh Rare to Well Done (which they don't recommend obviously).  I ordered the ribeye and it came out charbroiled perfectly on the inside, a slight grey line, and then the rare inside. My first Pittsburgh rare steak.  Interestingly, a lot of people in the area and even in Philadelphia haven't heard of Pittsburgh Rare cooking  temperature."}
{"text":"Decent place to grab a steak.

My wife knowing the carnivore the I am picked the Pittsburgh Steak Company for Father's Day since it was about the only steak house in Pittsburgh that we hadn't tried yet.

The three of us walked in and where seated immediately as we had reservations. We started off with the crab dip and it was very good. ($8.95)

I ordered the Montreal Porterhouse with a salad and baked potato as my entree. ($29.95) The wife ordered the Medallions of Filet (Filet medallions prepared in a Brandy sauce with mushroom, peppers and onions.) with a salad and baked potato ($20.95) and our daughter ordered the.............................drum roll................................. kids cheeseburger and fries. ($5.95)

FYI They do offer a kid's menu you just have to ask.

Our salads were good and the dressing was really good. The fresh bread offered with them was tasty as well. 

My porterhouse was good but, it wasn't outstanding. It was tender and juicy. The Montreal seasoning was pretty good but as others have stated my steak was missing something. I added salt, pepper and A1 steak sauce which helped but it was still missing something. Not sure what. The baked potato was really good though.

My wife said her steak was about the same as mine. Good but missing something. My daughter give me a couple fries and a piece of her burger and I was very surprised. They were both FREAKIN OUTSTANDING! I will defiantly be back for a burger and fries.

All in all our food was good and the service was good but, I just could not justify the price when Capital Grille, Hyde Park, Morton's and Ruth Chris are some much better for pretty much the same price."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a lot I always order prime rib or filet best steak that I ate in 7 states and I do like good steak . Jim the waiter is the best he has been there as long as I have gone there . Always polite and very good at what he does, my wife and I will be there to eat dinner and bring in the new year I give it five stars and everybody should try this place .and it's casual dress . And for Chris w that sad the place looks empty, if you really eat there you would know the bar is in the front tables in back. Maybe bar was empty .jim the waiter keep up the great job"}
{"text":"Tried dinner there on a coupon. Overall a good experience, but not the caliber steakhouse the prices imply. Great martinis."}
{"text":"So I read the reviews of this place first but curiosity got the best of me.  I figured that since the last two reviews were positive  that maybe efforts were made to turn things around but I guessed wrong. 

So after reading the outside menu, I decided on the lemon cod. The bartender was my server and wasn't really rude but kinda \"Pittsburgh salty\" which would be fine at some of the lower class bars in the area but not a place that charges 16 bucks a plate for fish. The portions were small, the presentation was laughably amateurish,  and the food wasn't horrible but I could have got much better fish for the same price at Pipers Pub. The decor is nice and the place seems clean but that seems to be about the only high points. I would not eat here again. If you want first rate food on the south side check out Pipers Pub, Local, Cheesecake Factory, or The Smiling Moose and leave PSC to their delusions of being \"upscale\"."}
{"text":"Probably one of the more underwhelming experiences I've had since getting to Pittsburgh.

Service was slow.  I felt sorry for the guy - I don't think he was bad, but maybe they were understaffed?  Anyway, it took about 15 minutes for me to get my water (but only 5 for my friends to get wine and beer?).  We didn't get our entrees for an hour.  

I got the prime rib, and my friends got the NY strip steak and ribs.  I opted out of getting the salad, because I was pretty sure it was going to be bad.  Lo and behold, it was your standard iceberg lettuce with almost no toppings, drenched in salad dressing.  Even one of my friends decided not to touch the thing.  I thought I had dodged a bullet with that one, but was stuck snacking on the tasteless bread.  

My prime rib was pretty... lifeless.  One does expect steaks to be lifeless by the time they get to the table, but this one simply lacked any sort of flavor at all.  I resorted to drenching the thing in horseradish, which resulted in several wasabi inspired nose clearing moments.  I think my friends' dishes were OK.  Nothing to write home about.

I think Pittsburgh Steakhouse co is probably good if you don't care about steak.  The place is old fashioned and clearly meets the needs of a certain clientele.  But if you are looking for flavorful beef, don't come here."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time since the new owners have taken over. We ordered sushi (New on the menu) and the porter house. There are new owners,new chefs, new servers and bartenders. The food was delicious our steak was cooked to perfection and everyone else at our table was happy. 

The reason for the 5 stars is definitely the service and the sushi! They have a new sushi bar and a passionate sushi chef and it shows! This was some of the best sushi I have had in pittsburgh! My father in law who is not a sushi \"fan\" had at least three pieces! I will go back again and again for the service, steak and definitely the sushi!"}
{"text":"This is one of the most honest reviews this place will get.  

#1 you cannot compare this place against other steakhouses.  It's simply not in the same category.  
#2 you have to understand there are no comparable places in the immediate area
#3 you have to understand what is good and what is bad on the menu.  Steak salad...great, mark madden salad...great, all you can eat steak...better watch this one.  

Again, this is old school pittsburgh in its finest.  You aren't going to get all jazzed up here by servers.  They will treat you with respect.  And after all, don't we all just want a little respect from now and again."}
{"text":"High steakhouse prices but not high quality.  I ordered the filet and it was undercooked twice (asked for medium) and my boyfriend ordered the strip and it was tough and cooked.  Save your money and go to Hyde Park or likewise instead."}
{"text":"Excellent steak salad.  I've had a great experimented every time that I have dined here."}
{"text":"This place USED TO serve really good food.  Lately, it has gone extremely downhill.  Food served cold...iffy service.   Just not worth the hassle of finding a place to park to support a business that shows that it just doesn't care anymore.  Sorry, I really wish the guy that goes to restaurants and turns them around would hit this place.  It COULD BE a gem if someone would remind the owner that it is the customers who make or break a business based on the service provided to them."}
{"text":"Awful. Just awful. Start to finish, this place was a first and a last. My partner and I wanted to try someplace new and were in the mood for steak. Since we'd driven past the Pittsburgh Steak Co. many times and always wondered about it, we decided to give it a try. The awning outside gives it the facade of an upscale establishment but don't be fooled -- it most certainly is not. When we first walked in, no one seated us. The Backstreet Boys were playing embarrassingly loudly on the sound system, followed by a miserable medley of 80s pop songs and awkward disco music. The music definitely made the whole experience strange from the outset. Add to that shoddy, unconcerned service, sloppy tables, three meager slices of cold, crumbly bread. I started with the French onion soup, which was made with chicken broth instead of beef stock. It tasted exactly like that boxed Stovetop stuffing you get at the grocery store, and was served warm, not hot. Then you get right down to the point -- the STEAK. I ordered the flatiron and he had the crabmeat stuffed filet mignon. Both were absolutely disappointing. Bland bland bland. I had to add salt just to taste the meat. There was no vegetable or salad offered on the side with a $35-40 per plate steak dinner, only something called \"cheesy mash,\" which we both got on the side. This stuff was definitely powdered potatoes with water added. Even though it was bright yellow in color, it did not contain a hint of real cheese. It was piled high on the plate to compensate for the very small portions of actual meat that were served. The crabmeat stuffed filet mignon was a meager portion of actual meat. On the plate was a very unsettling dipping sauce that we were both pretty sure was just some melted Velveeta with parsley sprinkled on top. Took one taste and it turned me right off. Overall, we could've (and have!) made much better steak ourselves at home. Save your time and money and DON'T GO HERE! You will be disappointed."}
{"text":"We eat here often and we never, ever have a bad meal.  The quality of the food is always good and the service is amazing.  If you are looking for good atmosphere, make sure to sit in the front section of the place, t is fun to people watch!  Try the Steak Rolls and the Fried Zucchini... both rock, and the steak burger is awesome!"}

{"text":"My fiancee and I had a wedding dinner rehearsal scheduled here.

We signed the contract. Did the pleasantries. And we were off on our merry way.

Getting in touch and confirming all of this was a *nightmare*. They didn't reply, they'd take days and sometimes weeks to just confirm this contract, but eventually we *did* get it!

So here we are, a month out from the wedding. I email them to make sure all is well and good, and...?

They say \"OH, we thought you cancelled.\"  ????

They royally screwed us last minute and I would have never known had I not reached out to them (it took two emails and a span of several days).

The contract was meaningless. 

Supposedly they're shut down now because of a liquor license problem. So instead of letting us know this, they abandoned all responsibilities and did the mature thing by blaming us.

I would *NEVER* patron their restaurant again after this."}
{"text":"I ordered a Pittsburgh/Chicago Rare/Black and Blue steak and it came out grey and with faint grill marks. The PIttsburgh Steak Company cannot make a steak to correct pittsburgh rare doneness? 

Food was just thrown on the plate, with no consideration for appearance. And it was not busy in there. Pathetic."}
{"text":"My wife and I have just moved to Pittsburgh and we were excited for a night out on the town sans kiddo's. We booked a hotel room downtown and set off for a nice dinner and a nice night Dahn Tahn!
We decided on a good steak dinner and sought out a great steak at a reasonable price! We settled on Pittsburgh's Steak Company...bad choice.
We ordered deep fried calamari as a starter along with a diet coke and coke to help wash it down...the server was DYNAMITE! Mallory was what you want in a server, attentive, not intrusive, and there when you need a refill! 
Back to the food!
The food came out in a timely manner but one major problem at the first bite the calamari was under cooked! It was straight out of the fryer but not cooked through YUCK! Nothing like a rubbery pop and crunch of under-cooked calamari!
We had also placed our order for two bowls of french onion soup and two 12 ounce NY strip steaks mine also had a Gorgonzola topper.
The french onion soup was weak, bland, and lackluster at best! The onions lacked any flavor, the bread overpowered the bowl, the cheese was about the only thing in the bowl that was redeeming.
Then the main course arrived! Two thick steaks my wife's was supposed to be medium and mine medium rare. The Gorgonzola was a thick white melted blanket on top of my steak...not a topper but an equal on the plate with the steak! Off to the races as these were thick cuts of NY strip and that's when the mystery of how do you screw up a steak began! It's a steak that the cooks even at franchise restaurants can seem to get right 95% of the time. Oh what an epic failure! The cut of steak was not the tender juicy strip I was expecting but a chewy more on the rare side of things monster that was costing me $25 just to eat. The Gorgonzola was a mild cheesy blanket that lacked any of the pop you expect from Gorgonzola! The steak had little to no fat trimmed off the cut leading to those fun bites of chewing, chewing some more then being faced with the decision to spit out the fat or swallow it whole. My wife who ordered it at medium got a cut that was cooked to more medium rare, the blood on her plate turned her stomach and finished her halfway through her not so tender monster. 
Now instead of being out on the town with my wife, enjoying some of the fun and character that Pittsburgh has to offer we are holed up in our hotel room nursing aching stomachs as we can't seem to get past the overpriced, poorly cooked fare our bodies are trying to digest.
STAY AWAY!!!!! Besides the server and the soda the food fell flat and lacked any real redeeming qualities! Pittsburgh is our new home but we will never bother to submit ourselves to the culinary crumminess that is Pittsburgh Steak CO again."}
{"text":"Place was OK but not on par with either Mortons or Ruth Chris...nice seating, decent decor, pretty clean...the app, salads & soup were good...nothing outstanding...I had a nice flat iron which was very good...she had a crab stuffed filet and it was interesting in that the meat looked more like a dark pork chop and the crab didn't taste like crab...just a weird, almost soapy taste...blah!! I'd return but surely would never order that again!"}
{"text":"I thought it was good not outstanding and not bad...the steak was done to a perfect med rare and my wife's was done to her liking... We both in joyed it but it was a little pricey..."}
{"text":"BEST STEAK AND LOBSTER EVER!!!!!  This was a very nice nightout watching the Pens game and enjoying the newly remodeled atmosphere.  The service was excellent despite the couple who was cranky dining next to us.   We felt so bad for the server who just couldn't make them happy no matter what she did. People should just stay home.  We absolutely loved it and will be back regularly!!!"}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate my mom's 60th birthday after she had seen it and asked to go.  The service was below average (waited 30 minutes for 2 salads and 2 slabs of meat at LUNCH time). Steak Salad was more of a French Fries salad barely any lettuce or veggies at all.  The Christo salad had jumbo \"shrimp like\" pieces that I'm not convinced were shrimp because they tasted spoiled, the chicken was fatty, and the salad tasted burned in every bite. The two steaks were both ordered medium (as they tell you that they DO NOT RECOMMEND MEDIUM WELL, which is my preferred style) and one steak was brown in the middle and one was red. No consistency.  We then waited for 20-30 minutes for the waiter to ask us if we'd like more water.  As if all of this wasn't bad enough.... the MAJOR insult was that inside of the Heinz Tomato Ketchup bottle (p.s. this is PITTSBURGH) was some imitation ketchup or catsup, or ... well, I'm not sure what.  I KNOW MY KETCHUP, ESPECIALLY HEINZ! So... the bottle was washed and refilled with imitation crap. NEVER AGAIN. Not worth the money spent, and I'd recommend ANY other steak house before coming here again."}
{"text":"Everytime I drive past the place is empty but one time I got a steak and cheese sub and fries....they messed up the order, n like I said it was just steak n cheese and fries  no toppings no nothing and after I drove home, found out it had onions all through it?!? The bread was terrible I thought n the steak was bad too,, the place is called steak company so figured that would be good but it really wasn't. 

Like I said the place is always empty when I see it, there's a reason"}
{"text":"above average food. quick service. I got the shrimp peppered penne and felt it was a rather small portion for the price."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid, for 20 years now.  Went for my one year wedding anniversary and was disappointed.  The service and food were ok, but for the price I could have had 5 times as much food anywhere else.  The seats are uncomfortable and shift, it's dark and dreary inside."}
{"text":"For a place to be known for steak, it should be amazing!  7 of us, 3 steaks not cooked correctly.  Little to no taste to the steak."}
{"text":"The worst thing about the place is the atmosphere. It closely resembles a Denny's mixed with a sports bar. The second worst thing is the food. It was bland, unevenly cooked, and simply terrible. 

They did not serve me the cut of steak which is listed on the menu, yet they have the nerve to charge outrageous prices. 

If you think you are headed here for fine dining you are terribly mistaken, because all you will end with is terrible food at fine dining prices. 

Taste of Food: 1 out of 5 
Quality of Food: 1 out of 5 
Atmosphere: 1 out of 5 
Value: 0 out of 5 

Do your self a favor and avoid this place, unless of course you are playing a cruel joke on someone."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly unimpressed. I ordered a ribeye and received something nearer to a chuck steak. I asked for medium to medium-rare, and got well done. The salad was watery. And to top it off, there was a table of drunks nearby."}
{"text":"We had our rehearsal dinner here, and I couldn't be happier with it.  They were super nice, the food was good, and the private room upstairs was decorated beautifully for Christmas.  

That being said, I do see what everyone sees who has reviewed this restaurant.  It IS dark, and the stairs right when you walk in are a bit sketchy.  We went here originally with a restaurant.com certificate, and with the $25 off, it's not a bad deal.  Best steak in town?  Certainly not.  Is there anything that stands out about this place?  Nah.  But it's good, and it has good food.  I'm not sure I'd go back w/o the $25 off, but it's a-ok with me."}
{"text":"I actually like this place. It has an old style independent steakhouse vibe. No it doesn't have the polish of a Capital Grill, Palm, Ruths Chris or other high end national chains so you get a more informal dining experience. The service is a bit abrupt but attentive enough. After several visits, I really have no complaints about the quality of the food. Prices are not bad for a premium steak dinner. I'll be back without a second thought."}
{"text":"We ended up here after our initial dining choice was waved off by an unannounced private party, followed by a martini ordering nightmare down the street.  PSC was an oasis at just the right time.  The ambiance wasn't 5*, hence my rating, but the martinis were large, cold and dry and the gorgonzola filet melted in my mouth.  The garlic butter beans were also a great side."}
{"text":"Can someone explain why they sat the group that entered after me before they sat me?  

This is a bar, plain and simple -- nothing more.  Yes, they serve food, but you are better off getting drunk first.  At least that way you wont be able to taste the food that you do order.  After finally being seated 10 minutes after we should have been seated, I noticed that the dining area was empty. NO ONE had passed us on the way out and our server was ONLY dealing with two tables.  I should have taken that as an omen to leave; but I was HUNGRY!

After letting my hot head deflate a little, I looked through the menu and we ordered the following items:

French onion soup
Potato skins
Prime rib (med) with baked potato and apple sauce
New york strip (med rare)  with twice baked and tomato/cucumber salad

The potato skins came out rather quickly and this helped my mood a bit.  I tasted it and found that it was actually rather good.  My hopes had gone up with that first bite.  I could taste the potato, the cheese, and the bacon and they went quite well together. As I was consuming the little delectable treats, the French Onion Soup and my tomato/cucumber arrived at the table.  It is somewhat difficult to ruin my salad, you would have to serve rotten veggies; on the converse, they didn't do anything I couldn't do.  At least I enjoyed the veggies.  The soup was an entirely different matter.  A more appropriate name would have been Italian Breadcrumb Soup.  It was truly the worst cup of French Onion soup that I have EVER eaten.  All I could taste was a preponderance of Italian breadcrumbs.  Who adds breadcrumbs to French Onion soup?  I moved back to my remaining potato skins.

Our entrees arrived some time later and so I was able to look around at the entirety of this business.  It is interesting to see that it is a bar in the front, tavern-esque seating in the center, and a dining room in the rear.  While the interior looks nice, though, it wasn't spectacular and it wasn't making my meal any better.  When our entrees finally arrived, I focused on them.

The prime rib came overcooked.  It looked as if they dipped it in the au jus sauce.  That is beyond a novice mistake.  You do NOT dip a prime rib or steak in au jus if it is supposed to have a temperature of Medium-Well or less.  Why you ask?  Well, because of the fact that the au jus is VERY hot and it will cook the prime rib at least ONE temperature higher.  At least the New York strip was cooked to the proper temperature.  After taking several bites, we both came to the same realization: these were the two worst steaks we have ever eaten at a business that calls itself a \"steak company\" or \"steak house.\"  Both of the cuts were rubbery, fatty, low on taste and high on gristle.  Is it possible they get their steaks from the same place that Taco Bell gets their meat?

Suffice to say, we didn't finish the meal and I doubt we will be returning.  I feel comfortable with the 1-star solely because of the potato skins."}
{"text":"This place must be be a front for some illegal activity behind the scenes. When one orders steak at a steak house you expect flavorful pieces of meat. I ordered the porterhouse and the waitress asked if I wanted steaksauce. Now, a perfectly seasoned steak from a steakhouse should not need steaksauce. I needed steaksauce after one bite. It was tender, nice grill marks, but whomever cooked my steak neglected to use the basic seasonings of salt and pepper. It was the blandest steak I've ever tasted. I asked for potato chips instead of the potato, and loved the homemade chips. Dark, crispy and salty, not greasy at all. Came here for lunch once and had the eggplant parm, it was very good. The chef used Pank breadcrumbs and the edges stayed crispy even under a blanket of excellent sauce. Lots of fresh mozzarella on top. Very good dish, but not enough to make me forget a very bad steak."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh on what happened to be Saint Practice Day.  For those of you who don't know, this is the weekend before Saint Patricks Day.  Pittsburgh - hats off, you guys know how to party.  Wow.

I was staying at the mile or so away Sheraton, and figured I would join in the festivities and created my own pub crawl on Carson Street.  Unfortunately I ended up at Pittsburgh Steak Company.

From the very first few steps in the door, I probably should have known better.  There is a sign that says Private Dining Upstairs.  The hallway was cluttered with what you would expect with a bad tenant at a 3 family rental.  Seeing the bar, my desired destination to the right, I went through the next set of doors.  The lack of crowd and open seats at the bar probably should have been my second clue.

I hop up to the bar, and try figuring out the taps to my right.  There is a stout, and being St. Practice Day, I figured that might be a good choice.  I asked the bartender who made the stout, but unfortunately he doesn't know, and explains to me what a stout is.  I ask again.  Now he's really confused.  We finally, after some checking with management, me with my smart phone, and likely some guessing, determine that there is a good chance this is the Poet Stout from Keweenaw Brewing Company.  The bartender, in somewhat of a surrender, kind of shrugs and says it's not what we wanted, nor what we ordered, but we had to get a stout in here today.  Amazing.

A few moments go by, and I overhear another conversation.  A woman is asking the bartender about a menu item.  His reply - I really have no idea what it's like.  It's far to expensive for my budget to try something like that on the menu.  Sad on many levels.

I decide I need something to eat, if I am going to continue my trek.  I order the Steak Rolls.  \"Marinated, ground filet, sauteed onions, mushrooms, Asiago and mozzarella cheeses placed in an egg roll wrap and fried to golden brown. Two to an order served with an Asian dippimg sauce\"  (the typo is theirs from their website, not mine).  They were rather tasty, however someone missed the second word.  Nothing ground about the huge chunks of what seemed like slow cooked potroast in my eggrolls.

In general there seems to be a sort of identity confusion here at this restaurant.  I think the wall to the right of the bar is rather telling.  They don't know if they want to be the \"poster like\" cover of Sports Illustrated with QB Big Ben, or the much classier, beautifully framed original painting showcasing the legends of the Penguins right beside it.

I hope they figure it out before it's too late."}
{"text":"This place was recommend by the hotel I was staying at.  It was the worst prime rib I've ever had.  There was fat running throughout the piece of meat that was practically impervious to my knife (which actually wasn't a good steak knife at all).  It extremely hard to chew.

The service was only so-so.

The one hight point of the evening: the chocolate pudding creme brulee.

We complained to the hotel shuttle driver on the way home and apparently this place is \"hit or miss\" and it depends on \"who's in the kitchen.\"  That's just no good at all."}
{"text":"Flat iron steak was huge. It was cooked as ordered. The french fries are hand cut. They were tasty. The filet was cooked as ordered. The side salad was a normal side salad. I wish this place offered two sides with your meal. We went before the rush, and service was good. It is a bit pricy, but I might be back."}
{"text":"We ate here a few weeks ago per a recommendation from the hotel we were staying at.  While I do not eat steak a few of my friends do and they said they liked it.  I ordered the Chicken Peppered Penne which was delicious.  I asked them to make it extra spicy which they did.  The pasta was cooked perfectly, the sauce was creamy, and the dish had a great flavor.  The service was good and the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"This was our 7th visit to PIttsburgh Steak Company, for Valentine's Day dinner. As rated below the waitress was great, but the cook & bartenders were not at their best.. We ordered a strip steak medium & we were asked if they could butterfly to speed up the cooking process. Reluctantly we agreed, the steak arrived well done, when we sent it back the next one came out rare. So poor cook in kitchen.  Our drinks another story, my better half found a winged insect in her Manhattan, possibly a replacement for the missing cherry, we sent it back the replacement was straight bourbon with no vermouth or garnish \"poor bartender\". The restaurant is as good as the team providing the service unfortunately the majority of this team should have been benched."}
{"text":"Now I know why this place is rated so low. The owner is scum. I'm one of the biggest restaurant connoisseurs that you'll ever meet. I have been to some of the best restaurants in the country and tonight, I went to the worst one that I have EVER been to in my life. DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT ever step into The Pittsburgh Steak Company. It will be the worst experience you'll ever have in a restaurant, I promise.

P.s. I wish I could choose 0 stars."}
{"text":"This place gets a most improved award.

They used to have crap for food.  But with increased competition they have really gotten better.

The service here is generally better then average as well. The place is kept up nicely too."}
{"text":"Went out to dinner here with a few friends on a Saturday night. We traveled about an hour from out of town. The parking lot outside was very convenient and reasonably priced. The actual restaurant is very small inside and has charm, but can use a little fancying up. Our server was friendly and efficient. We ordered a fried zucchini appetizer to start which was priced well and reasonably portioned. I also ordered a 7oz petit filet that cost $28.00. The steak was a very good cut of meat and was cooked perfectly. I didn't think it was worth $27.00 though, especially because you only get one side or a salad, not both. My friends that got strip steaks complained of theirs being tough and fatty. Overall, I think the food was good, but I really don't think you get much for the premium you're paying here. They restaurant isn't fancy enough and the portions aren't big enough to be charging what they're charging here. I was also very put off by the fact that a tip was already applied to the bill. Our party was only 6 people. I think it's incredibly rude to add a tip and I honestly would have tipped more than $5 on a $32.00 bill, but decided not to because I was so put off by it already being added."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre for the prices. The chicken was bland and the green beans weren't anything special. The interior looks nice..."}
{"text":"As you can see by the overall rating on this restaurant you should avoid!!!!! I have been twice the first time was much better than the first. The first time I went with a party of 7 and we sat at a round table had apps, dinner and drinks and everything was fine and service was good. The second time I made a reservation 3 weeks ahead of time since it was a large party after my graduation (my family came from out of town about 20 people). When we got there they told us we would be at two separate tables even though when I made the reservation they said that we would all be seated together. Not only were we separated but instead of connecting two long rectangular tables they had about 15 of us at a long table and my mom and grandma and 3 others at a circular table across the room. I was pretty mad about that had I known it wouldve been like that I never would have went. Anyway the food and service was also awful. We had to flag servers down and NO ONE OF THE TWENTY PEOPLE were impressed with their food. In fact my dad had to buy food right after we left because he didnt eat anything. The whole experience was really disappointing especially when youre paying so much for bad food and service. Never ever again. Listen to the reviews and go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Coming from someone who works in a chain steakhouse I had high hopes for the steak here. 
Myself and 2 other people all ordered the New York Strip. Quick service but once the steaks came they were tough and and flavorless. When we brought it to our waiters AND managers attention they did nothing to fix the problem and we still had to pay for our salads and drinks. I have been in the service industry for years and customer service is something that was greatly lacking at this restaurant. I'm sorry to say I will not be returning."}
{"text":"It took an hour for 2 steaks with mashed potatoes to come out of the kitchen.

Food and price are not worth the wait. 

The server we had was nice, apologetic, and courteous about the delay. I'm sure it wasn't his fault that the kitchen was screwing around.

You can also hear how loud and chaotic the kitchen is from the dining area... the sushi chef kept talking about how he burned himself, servers joking around with each other, and one of the servers even said \"this is definitely not a place to go if you're in a hurry\" to a customer. 

Overall, definitely a hot mess of a place."}
{"text":"I went here Monday night for the all you can eat Prime Rib.  The Prim Rib is always on par, but I want to talk about the potatoes.  We are mashed potato fans, but not everyone serves mashed potatoes.  It's a crime in my book not to have mashed potatoes, but that's my opinion.  These mashed potatoes were new.  They were a three cheesed mashed potato with bacon pieces.  My boyfriend ordered an extra helping and then ordered them for dessert.  We are serious about potatoes.  Let me just tell you that these potatoes are like crack.  We just couldn't get enough.  We didn't see pieces of bacon, but it didn't matter, these potatoes were devoured.  When the potatoes came for dessert (no I wasn't kidding), we were told that they had forgotten to put the bacon in the potatoes we ate for dinner.  OMG is all I can say.  These are the best potatoes I have ever had and I hope they stay on the menu.  I would go there just to eat those potatoes."}
{"text":"After many great visits, both the service and the steaks, I am sad to report we tried to patronize the PSC on Friday night, and found that it is not permanently closed.  We ended up eating across the street, where our waitress said she heard they had just closed, and is confirmed by the PSC website, reporting and apologizing for having to close after 27 years.  RIP Pittsburgh Steak Company, you had the best rib-eye in the tri-state area."}
{"text":"Old school, yes.  Good food and fast service, yes.  Would I go back?  Depends.  I went here after googling steak houses in Pittsburgh and this place came up and it is located only a few miles from our hotel.  It was almost empty although it was around 9pm and the beginning of spring break at Pitt so easily explainable.  The waitress was freindly but not a great waitress in that she really didn't refill the drinks until we asked her to and she kind of seemed like she was tired, worn out, etc.  I decided on the orange roughy with a side caesar salad and the cheddar smashed potatoes.  The fish came in a cream sauce which I did not want so I asked them to season the fish in a way that the sauce won't be missed.  They definitelty listened to me b/c the roughy turned out pretty good and the salad was a nice size for a starter salad.  The cheddar potatoes were what made the meal.  They were fantastic and I wish more places would start offering this as a side choice.  The only complaint is that the portion of the potatoes was a little on the small side; however, they were really good and I didn't leave hungry which is always a plus.  This place was a nice beginning to my stay in Pittsburgh and the best meal that I had while I was in town."}
{"text":"Honestly it was mediocre!  Not great! I would not go back! Poor martinis, steak was OK and the side's were just ok."}
{"text":"Pgh Steak Company is an institution in the South Side, it's old school, it's get the job done, and it's a place to take your parents/grandparents. I'm not blown away by the menu, it's fairly typical offerings. The steak and pasta entrees are what you would expect, but that doesn't mean the food isn't done well. It's satisfying, which all it needs to do. This is not the establish for culinary innovation and I probably wouldn't go here on a date night or on a whim, but the next time I have plans with Nana and Gramps Pittsburgh Steak will be on the top of our list. Also, it was dark in the back dining room. The grandparents had trouble reading the menu, I don't know what the low-light was trying to hide, but put some candles on the table if you're going to keep things that dim."}
{"text":"Celebrated a birthday here today and first time we have been back since they re-opened.  Everything was fantastic.  My NY Strip was done perfectly and very well-seasoned, my son had a filet and was very pleased as well.  My wife had the lobster tails and said she definitely made the right choice.  They were short-staffed today due to a few employees being out but the chef (Mike) did everything he could to feel like he appreciated our business.  Thanks for helping finish off a great day!"}
{"text":"We went there since we got a restaurant $50 gift certificate. The service was terrible. We tied surf and turf, the lobster was ok but the sirlion was terrible. The ribeye was good. The sides were as terrible as the service. The salad were not fresh.

Moreover, they don't have dessert menu. And tax plus tips kill this deal. We spend more than $100 for this dinner and not a deal at all.

Restaurant.com gift certificate may mislead you, be careful!"}
{"text":"First and last time there!  The bus boy dropped the rag on the floor, picked it up and immediately wiped a table down with this now, dirty rag.  My husband ordered another drink, he never got it.  Our sides were luke warm at best.  Bread was stale and the entre ordered Salmon Majestic, was suppose to have crab meat and artichoke hearts on it, which is the reason ordered, There were no artichoke hearts on it. When I brought this to our waiters attention, he said he would see if he can dig some up.  When I inquired about it 10-15 minutes later he said, they thought they were on it and wouldn't bring any more.  Although price wasn't adjusted.   When I advised about the drink not being served, he said nothing, although offered to bring another serving of rice even though we were done with dinner.  When he brought the check he said, I couldn't do anything about the dinner but I took off the wine(which wasn't the drink that was ordered, it was a chevez!) off the check.  Horrible!!!"}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time when I lived in the city, now I only make it a couple fo times a month.  Dean and Richie (owners) are total pittsburgh originals.  You have to have the right expectations with this place.  The steaks are not as good as capital grille, mortons, etc.. But, they are very reasonably priced and are good.. not great...but good.  I suggest you just have a cheesburgher or try the filet/portabella appetizer (which used to be the best deal in town at 8.95, however now I think it's like $13).  My buddy Dan is the bartender and he's been doing it since he was 18 about 1/2 his life so he knows what he's doing you'll have fine conversation if you go alone and end up talking to the bartender all night.  The other bartender is good too.. Josh."}
{"text":"I've been to Pittsburgh Steak Company a couple times.... once to try their steak and once for their Prime Rib special Monday nights (all you can eat for 17 bucks)

Their steak is moderately priced, but underseasoned (a little more salt + pepper please!) and lacked the nice sear outside I like.  I've had better tasting steaks at chain restaurants...

More importantly though, their all you can eat Prime Rib dinner.  It starts out with a generic Italian bread with butter.  Next up comes an iceberg salad that is still wet from the bag and soggy cucumber slices.  Their Prime Rib came next.  They start at medium rare; they can't do rare, which is disappointing.  The first piece of Prime Rib was underseasoned, extremely chewy, and was a really poor piece of meat in general.  Excess fat, and not in the marbled good sort of way.  Also excess silverskin.  Gross.

I will say that the second piece was much better though.  But inconsistent quality.....  Halfway through my third piece (overcooked) I decided to stop w/ the meat and just eat bread to fill up.

It also came with a side; I picked creamed spinach.  Pretty standard.

Like Neal said, no it's not Capital Grille or Morton's, but there's no reason to settle for mediocre to sub-par steaks either... or is there?"}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times and the food is consistently good, so I will give it that much, but the service here is TERRIBLE - so much that it bring this solid 4-5 star food down to 2.

To start this out on a positive note - the French Onion soup is to die for and is probably one of the best French Onion soups I've ever tasted. It has a ton of onions, a nice dark broth, rosemary galore and is overflowing with melted cheese. For my entrée I usually get the Steak Salad because I love steak, but not for lunch, so Steak Salad it is. The steak is cooked to medium perfection and is so juicy and delicious. When my significant other joins me, he usually gets the Mark Madden salad and he is always impressed with this Pittsburgh favorite - what's not to love about buffalo chicken?

Now onto the negative. As I said, I went here for lunch, which means I didn't have the luxury of time. Time is money people!! I ordered my water, my soup and my steak salad. I got one glass of water, which remained empty the remaining 50 minutes I was there. The soup came out within 15 minutes of ordering it, which I thought to be a little long for soup, but not extremely out of the ordinary. Then it was another 25 minutes until the salad came out!! Waiting for my salad sent me over the edge. What kind of lunch establishment has such long ticket waits? Do they understand it's called a \"lunch hour\" for a reason? Most people only have an hour for lunch and waiting 50 minutes to get your food is just plain unacceptable. People need to have time to eat (and enjoy their food - not scarf it down), pay their bill and get back to their place of employment. So as soon as the waitress (who I hadn't seen for quite a while) came with the food I immediately told her that I needed it to go now and she obliged - about 10 minutes later. When my to go container arrived I gave her my credit card and told her that she had omitted the dressing and silverware I would require to eat said salad. Again, 10 minutes later she came back with my receipt, dressing and silverware and not so much as an apology for the ridiculous wait time. With a time like that, it's surprising the kitchen isn't blocks away!

Like I said, food is fantastic and if time is not of the essence to you, then I would suggest going here for the food. However, be prepared to wait......and wait some more."}
{"text":"Well Dean the owner of the Pittsburgh Steak Company asked for me to give Pittsburgh Steak another chance, I pride myself at being fare.  So my wife, daughter and I returned to Pittsburgh Steak for dinner.  Interesting enough we had the same server James as we had the previous time at Pittsburgh Steak.  We started with an order of Crab Stuffed Mushroom Caps and then we ordered the appetizer special Bacon Rapped Stuffed Jalapenos.  James was very attentive this time and he was very engaging.   The Mushroom caps came out first, they were great, the crab stuffing and the mushroom blended well and the flavor combination was meaty and the spice combination was very satisfying.   The stuff jalapenos came out next and the combination of the jalapenos and bacon is a classic but the cheese & crab meat stuffing brought in a new flavor that melded well with the classic. The cheese and crab turns the heat of the normal bacon wrapped jalapeno but provides and nice level of heat at the end.

My wife ordered the filet medallions in a brandy mushroom and green pepper sauce.  My daughter was going to order the pasta but after she tasted the crab she decided to get the Crab Cakes.  I ordered Hanger Steak.  My wife ordered the Filet Medallions.  The Crab Cakes were very tasty and full of crab and not too much filler.  My wife's Fillet was good but there was a little too much sauce.  Is was almost a stew.  I unfortunately couldn't taste it because it has bell peppers in it but she liked it.  The hanger steak was cooked to perfection.  Interesting enough, the Hanger Steak is one of the tenderest cuts of beef.  However, it also is one of the most flavorful cuts too, so you get the best of both worlds.  So as you know if there is a Crème Brulee, I will be reviewing it.  So as you can see from my photos Pittsburgh Steak had it and I got it.  The custard was good not great but good, the burlee was a bit on the chard side.  Unfortunately because the burlee was overdone it detracted from the whole burlee experience.  It the burlee was properly dome I believe it would have been outstanding.  The experience at Pittsburgh Steak was very good.   I am glad that I took dean up on trying it again.  Dean, thank you.

I would recommend if you are in the South Side and want a good steak then give Pittsburgh Steak Company a shot.  It's worth your time."}
