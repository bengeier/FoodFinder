{"text":"So I ordered:  plain parathan $2 chicken biryani $5.31 (yes it actually said this on the board)   Price wise: Definitely good value for money. Taste wise: Parathan smelt of burnt oil, so wouldn't order it again.  Biryani was pretty damn good and I enjoyed it.   So you place your order with man at the cash counter and he yells out to a lady in the kitchen- it works I guess and frankly speaking I really don't care if the order is taken by paper, pigeon carrier or smoke signals as long as they get it right.  Atmosphere/ambience: So whenever I go to any desi place for take away food i'm not looking for your 5 star treatment, let's be realistic afterall. But one thing I look for is cleanliness and unfortuantely this place doesn't mark high in this category. The guy who made the order for me was helping out in the kitchen area and he had just been on the phone, so no washing of hands etc. So even though I like'd the biryani I'll take a pass and perhaps wait until they decide to give these things a priority."}
{"text":"Im sure everyone on my iPhone Yelp app has been seeing me repeatedly checking in at Desi Corner every two days. It's called addiction in Kabab Roll form.   So here's the lowdown on the amazingness known as a Kabab Roll: Originally born on the streets of Karachi (at least to my knowledge, feel free to send me a wiki link proving me wrong if you have one), a very oily but thin paratha is spread and loaded with *boti* kabab(succulent cubed meat marinated & grilled with papaya & pakistani spices), a generous serving of thinly sliced red onions and fountains of green coriander and red chili chutney. Then, this paratha is rolled up tight, wrapped in parchment paper and inhaled by all classes of society on dilapitated Karachi streets. One Kabab Roll to unite them all.   Toronto suffers from a serious lack of roadside eating and until Desi Corner came along no one had the guts to dupe the kabab rolls of Karachi (beware of posers that use naan instead of paratha). The paratha at Desi Corner is not as oily obv. and the filler \"boti\" is replaced with seekh kababs (which is ground meat as opposed to cubes) but damn are they close to replicating the flavor of the green chutney and the spice. For $4, I get 60% closer to my cherished memories of Karachi.  Hey, I'll take it and one for the road too please."}
{"text":"The customer service is not up to par. However, it does have one of the best chicken biryani's I have ever tasted. But they did change cooks (I think) because the biryani is a bit different than before and we have been frequent customers there for the past 10+ years.  Take-out only, no seating at all. There is also a portion that is a 'grocery' section- which conveniently has all the ingredients needed for the biryani they make."}
{"text":"The food is great and customer service is really good too.  Whenever I am in Mississauga I always make sure I visit and get some great food for myself and family."}
{"text":"It's by far the best take out place for Pakistani halal food lovers. They have everything, even Haleem. The way it works is they have fresh food they prepare everyday but also have few dishes in the fridge that have not made the same day. Haleem is always from the fridge but it's always yummy. I did not like the tandoori chicken as It wasn't fresh other than that it's most popular for its chicken biryani which is freshly prepared everyday. I still prefer this place over Eastern Foods.  Unfortunately the neighbourhood is not the safest and or cleanest. There are lots of ppl begging for money and will bother u on ur way out. You can also order their food through 'Uber Eats' delivery service if you are feeling lazy."}
{"text":"don't go here!!!!!!! they have their son wearing fitted baseball caps and dressed like a thug.. imtimiditing people.. bad behavour no respect for people.. save yourseof the dignity and go to eastern foods"}
{"text":"This is what you should expect, Ok food most of the time, yes their Biriyani is good but it is a hit or miss.  I had unbelievably good Chicken Biriyani, and then so bad Biriyani that I just chucked it, same goes for their Beef and lamb Biriyani.   Shami kabobs, chicken or beef are really good, but sometimes they are stale, they go bad in your fridge in a day or the same day. I did mentioned this to the owners wife, she said \"it is not possible\" yes it is and it has happen numerous times.   Keema-Naan-pretty good Bihari-kabob-Ok but very spicy and not much flavor Shish-Kabob-chicken and beef are just Ok but very spicy Butter chicken ( frozen ) horrible,  Daal-very good Kharai chicken-super spicy and it was Ok Naan-decent but they burn it most of the time  Samosas-Ok Keema-pretty good but very spicy   Now Customer service: This has to be the first place that owner is worse than the staff. The staff actually are okay, most of the time polite, but the owner is so conceited,  you could be standing there for 5 minutes, and he would playing on his his laptop at the cash and would not even acknowledge you, and when he does, he just gives a blank stare, implying yes what do want ? if you ask him any questions about daily specials, he says go talk to the kitchen. I am sorry but he has no clue how run a business.  I stopped going there just because of the owner himself..and trust me he does not care.  So you may ask why this place is so busy, and how come they have been in the business for like 12 years, the answer is simple, HUGE PORTIONS AND SUPER CHEAP!  Thanks for reading"}
{"text":"While hardly the best in the  5&10 neighborhood, Desi Corner was always a decent enough spot to grab quick Indian takeout (chicken biryani, naan, kebabs etc). I used to always say that the saturation of Indians in Mississauga had created such healthy competition, that it's not that easy to find a spot that serves genuinely bad Indian food. While I would never recommend Desi Corner over BarBQ Tonite for instance, if you were looking for something decent, fast and cheap, Desi Corner was the place to go...until recently. Not sure if the management and/or kitchen staff (read: aunties and nanis) has changed, but the food here has sadly now gone from just decent to less than sub par.   I recently did a small order for a group and this is what we received:     1. Biryani, which was basically overcooked, mushy rice-cooker rice + masala, and what would appear to have been 1 cup of cooking oil in the takeout tray. So tragic.   2. Chicken kebabs, which were dry and almost entirely bland.   3. Ginger Chicken Masala, which was also quite bland and tasted like yesterday's chicken tikka masala with some ginger thrown in for good measure.   4. Undercooked doughy Naans.   5. Watered down raita (but to be fair, this is commonplace)  Sad to say that Desi corner, while far, far from being the best, was never this awful in the past. The food now is lazy, needlessly greasy and doesn't even taste good.     :("}
{"text":"I did not visit this place personally but my husband friend bought food for eid i have to say it was very good and the kheer was amazing."}
{"text":"Horrible food. good quantity though.  we catered from Desi Corner as Shaheen catering was fully booked for Eid catering orders.  we had 45 guests over and not a single person praised about their food.  2 aunties working in the kitchen need to buy new clothes (with all respect)."}
{"text":"Good price bad biryani, you get what you pay for, if you want good tasting chicken biryani just go across the street to Bar B Q tonight. This biryani is full of lemon slices instead of chicken pieces. Smells like lemon juice. I read good reviews about their kebobs which I haven't tried yet but their chicken biryani will be my last time ever eating it there."}
{"text":"Food nothing special. Portions were small. Not much flavour. Naan was ok. The fish was good. Service ok."}
{"text":"This place use to be good but now it has gone really bad, the biryani has no flavour it's boiled rice with meat"}
{"text":"The biggest issue I have with this little place is that it's not the cleanest, nor does it offer good customer service. The good bit? It's open till midnight i.e. you can get your biryani and kebab fix here because every other place in Mississauga runs out or closes by by 10pm.  What I am annoyed about? The guy clearly told me there'd be 3 pieces of chicken per package of biryani. Turns out, we only got 1 big piece and a teeny one. Third one, missing.   Biryani's can be spicy. Yet yummy. I can't take spice. Here's an Ankie Tip for what to do:   Ankie Tip - cool it down, douse it with the yogurt dip they give you, eat it. Save some for the next day, and repeat."}
{"text":"So it was late and we were lazy to go out, so this being open till late, we said let's try it out.  I ordered over the phone and the pickup was in 20mins, fair enough went there, ambience is dirty and more like a cramped place, let's add looked unhygienic from the kitchen interiors as well. Anyways ignoring that waited 15mins more and got the food. We had ordered Ginger Chicken Gravy, Biryani, Tandoori Leg and Naans. When opened the Gravy, it was cold like it just came out of a refrigerator, they didn't even bother to heat it up before serving. Nothing neither the Biryani nor the Leg were hot enough to eat. Had to microwave each dish again and we sat to eat. The taste of the gravy and leg seemed nice, but the biryani was literally sub standard. The worst was yet to come, after finishing the not at all good dinner, I wasn't feeling comfortable at all only to realize that at 3am I woke up and vomitted the entire stuff. My wife had the same issues and we both stayed hungry the following day. I really wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless you want to fall sick as well! Never going to this place again."}
{"text":"Giving them 3 stars because of how long they take to prepare food.   It's mostly a takeout place. Not an eat in.   Food is good. Prices are decent."}
{"text":"I had the chicken tikka, three naans, kabob rolls, butter chicken and two biryani plates to break fast for Ramadan. The chicken tikka and naans were the only enjoyable items we had purchased. We had spent roughly $44.00 for the whole meal. The butter chicken was not flavourful at all and had a more sweet side to it. The biryani was not spicy and there was not many pieces of meat, i was utterly disappointed. The kabob rolls were ok, they were average. The worst part was that I found a long strand of hair in one of the biryani boxes, and it was perhaps from one of the lady working in the back.   I picked up food from here on the way home, and did not live in this area. I tried calling back but there was no response, so i couldn't tell them about the issue."}
{"text":"Hands down best biryani place i have ever tried in north america.  Same goes for Bihari kabab. I wouldnt say the same about other stuff i the menu.  Always come here everytime i am in Toronto. Never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I finally went here after a recommendation by Farheen and I was not disapointed!!   The behari and seekh kabab rolls were totally fantastic. See Farheen's review for what a kabab roll is. But  basically its a spicy kabab with chutney and onions and salad all wrapped up in the best fresh hot naan.  I need to add that the naan it comes in is made super fresh (not the frozen kind, but actually made in a tandoor!!)   Totally quality food for only 5-6$ a person! Oh, its totally Halal for those that are looking!"}
{"text":"Note:  Take-out ONLY!  I'm torn.  Quite possibly the best Chicken Biryani ($6, taxes in) in town, BUT...it took approx. 15-20mins for me to get it, after ordering!  NO ONE else was ahead of me.  Lady behind the corner was just scooping biryani into containers, but none of them were for me.  She just stared at me, cluelessly, as I waited and waited.  Ordering system is broken.  You give the man behind the cash your order, he shouts it out to the women.  If the women don't hear/aren't paying attention/pissed off at the man for some reason, you're SOL!  And I think that's what happened to me.  My friend ordered a Keema Parantha, sorta like a meat dosa, and it was very tasty, but again, we waited some 15mins.  (At least that was made fresh, by hand, but biryani is scoop, scoop, scoop, & close styro container.)  She also ordered a Kashmiri Tea, but after the 15-20mins, flashing the cash man our death stares, the man apologises and says that he \"ran out\" of the liquid that makes the base of the tea.  Friend just got a refund since we didn't want to wait any longer!  Also questionable food handling practices.  Lady who makes the parantha was not wearing gloves, so who knows where she's touching as she's behind a counter.  :S  Alas tasty food so what is this Chicken Biryani in Mississauga to do??  Can't a girl get good, cheap food AND decent service?!?!"}
{"text":"Went to have their biryani and out of most of the places I have tried biryani in the GTA, theirs was probably the closest to biryani you get back home!  Highly recommend the biryani for sure"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible rude service! The male owner needs lessons in courtesy...he regularly treats his customers like shit and have seen many people walking out on him. Their chapli kebabs are good but everything else is subpar - they use instant SHaan spices in everything they cook and freeze their food and serve it in portions as ordered.Would never go there again. Try Eastern Foods in the same area instaed."}
{"text":"With a spicy masala kaboob with onion and tomatoes wrapped in fresh naan I wash the tingling sensation with a mouth full of Pakola a deliciously sweet Pakistani cream soda. I underestimate the amount of food I haven't tried.   This is a take out only place but the nice woman behind the counter connected with me and understood I wanted food right then to devour. A couple minutes later and $5.32 on debit (on change on premises) I was happily satisfied."}
{"text":"Never will I ever go back to this hole in the ground. I ordered spinach and biyryini the rice was fresh.  The spinach was sitting in a fridge for who knows how long. The rice had more tiny bones that I almost swallowed.  The chef was eating with his hands behind the counter. The lady that served me seemed very rude..unhappy in her workplace."}
