{"text":"Ordered their house fried rice and chilli chicken to go. Both were pretty good. Thinking of trying them again."}
{"text":"I just love this spot.    Not just the food which is the closest to thai food since i was in thailand but the cozy atmosphere and the snippy server.  A buddy of mine and myself have been coming for years when we work here and its a gem.   The spice doesnt feel powerful but the bite lingers like a girlfriend whos left things in your house.  Try the green curry chicky. Or as I call it the devils chicken.  Nomnom"}
{"text":"Consistently great Thai food. Traditional Pad Thai to kill for. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"if you are looking for food court quality food... it might be comparable to that. but definitely does not compare to sit-in restaurants. i wanted to like it because it has a convenient location to me, but would not be returning. ordered 4 dishes from the lunch special. not one of them edible."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food. One of the best places I've eaten at.  We had the Yellow Curry Beef- the beef was cooked perfectly. So tender and tasty, not over cooked like at a lot of places The Red Curry Tiger Shrimp was excellent- lots of shrimp and they were large Traditional Pad Thai- quite delicious Spicy Peanut Chicken- Actually spicy, and LOTS of flavor Spicy Garlic Eggplant- cant go wrong!   They even threw in a free vegetable stir fry because we ordered over a certain amount  The lady was friendly and helpful. Overall, we were very delighted with our food and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Server (part owner) hovered a lot (wasn't busy tonite). Worst part was they had shut off the hot water in the restroom. To me, that shows total disdain for your customers, and I hope it's a health code violation. I took the liberty of turning it on via the valve under the sink. Booya!"}
{"text":"Perfect food and it's delicious. The place is keept clean and it's a nice building and they treat their  customer really good. Take out is great because it's done fast and they dont waist your time."}
{"text":"Such a nice place,nice sevice and nice price.Creamy curry chicken ,sooooo good,the best one in the city.I go there 2-3 times per month from 2011 and the food is aiways good. The pad thai is excellent as well.I  finish it every time even though it is large. Another one i recommend is general taos chicken,crispy,sweet and a little bit spicy,yummy. It is definately an amazing  resteraut."}
{"text":"A coworker and I ordered chicken Pad Thai, Szechuan chicken, and beef satay shewers(what it says on the menu not a typo) into our hotel. This was easily the worse Asian food/ food that we have ever had. Both of us are big eaters and we ended up throwing half of this food in the garbage. I would have gladly traded traded for McDonald."}
{"text":"Been to a handful of Thai restaurants now  Disappointed, why does every pad Thai in the GTA tastes like ketchup? This isn't pad Thai other than the type of noodles they use.  Ketchup sauce is used as a cheaper and easier ingredient to make pad Thai. It tastes terrible and nothing like what pad Thai should be like.   Decent portions, but the takeout box is round/black/plastic and smaller than regular takeout boxes which are styrofoam/rectangular/white and almost double in size."}
{"text":"After years of being a good and loyal customer. I will never order from here again.  Last night i had one of the most terrible experiences with this place. First off, they got my order wrong and forgot to give me two dishes that i had already paid for. (it happens i guess, but that wasnt all) Secound, after i finally started eating i noticed a long black hair in my food. After calling to complain, all they offered was a free drink. (no thanks) Finally, this morning my entire family complained about feeling sick and being on the toilet all morning. (myself included)  I must say, that Canadian Thai's quality is getting worse, and I wont return."}
{"text":"I'll tell you what this is, but first let me get through the dry stuff..and I don't mean the food.  Cute little place with a clean floor, well placed chairs and not a completely boring layout of a completely white guy's idea of a Thai restaurant.  Nice lady that comes from the front desk which is really at the desk.  They really should call it the back desk, there's no such thing as a front desk at restaurants...or maybe I'm the only person who calls it the front desk.  Who cares.  I never had pad thai in my life, so I ordered the beef pad thai.  I asked what pd thai was, and I got even more confused after being given the explaination.  This place spent more than just pocket change on decoration, but damn it's kinda depressing here.  Orange light doesn't work for anything.  I think orange is the colour of boredom.  I mean, oranges are boring......you know what I'm saying??  I got some spring rolls and shrimp rolls, and I went home.    So let me now tell you what this place actually is; a small town Asian restaurant in Markham.  Markham is now a city....so FAIL! Nice staff, lovely service....uninspired food.   But then again, everyone eating here when I came was not Asian...so God bless these people who keep the economy going!"}
{"text":"All I can say is that they should change their name to Canadian Chinese. Their menu is full of Chinese dishes. Their soup of the day is Hot and Sour soup :)"}
{"text":"I have ordered take-out lunch from Canadian Thai, twice a month, for the past several months. I'm surprised it took me this long to say, I really enjoy their yellow curry chicken with rice!   Their lunch special is such a great value, for only about 10 bucks taxes in you get a container of yellow curry chicken with vegetables and lots of sauce to soak into the 2nd container of steamed white rice. Additionally you get a container of hot and sour soup, and a spring roll. Great value. The taste is excellent. I've tried their green curry and while its spiciness level wasn't as high as I expected (being that it had 3 chili symbols on the menu) it was still very good. I have yet to try the red curry.   I haven't dined in, but each time I go to pick up my order the place is always jam packed with diners during the lunch hour.   Having tried a few other dishes on their lunch menu, I can say that the other dishes, in my opinion, are good, but nothing to write home about. My favourite is still, by far, their curry.   I'm not a real Thai food enthusiast per se, so I cannot comment on whether the food here is authentic or not.   They do have a full bar so you can order drinks with your meal if you like. The place isn't very large and I imagine it could seat perhaps 25 to 35 max."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I respectfully disagree with Sephora's comment below - this is not Canadianized Thai. This is the only Thai restaurant I've had in Canada serving curries that actually compare to the amazing curry I had in Thailand.  Their Tom yum soup is delicious. My favourite is the red curry chicken - spicy, very tasty, flavourful, thick broth.  We also like the crispy beef a lot.  I've moved away from the area but whenever I am there to visit family I'm sure to order from here - I even ordered for my birthday this year!! I wish I could find Thai food like this in my area.  Here's to hoping the reviews for this place remain positive as I'd be devastated if they ever closed down.  LT."}
{"text":"My first visit here was very enjoyable. I popped in for a take out lunch special and although the place was almost at capacity, I was out the door in 5 minutes with lunch in hand.  I opted for the General Tao lunch special which came with plain rice, a Hot & Sour soup (I think that's what it was) and a spring roll for $8.95. With a pop, the whole thing came out to $12.  The portions are very fair for that price and the meal was very enjoyable.  The General Tao Chicken had a very different sauce than I am used to. It was dark, and soy based, sweet with some whole chilies, green pepper and onion slices within. And there was plenty of it, enough for every grain of rice to get some. To me, it was reminiscent of a black peanut sauce usually served with beef. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious! The soup was good and piping hot. The spring roll was a spring roll.  Although anyone with a peanut allergy should be wary going into a \"Thai\" resto, even this Chinese dish had a peanutty flavour. Be sure before you order.  I've taken the liberty of posting the lunch special menu again as some of the photos posted here have far-outdated prices.  The interior of the place is clean, modern and inviting. That's why I'm going to suggest coming here next week for a business luncheon. I have their basil beef in my crosshairs already. Unless the General insists again."}
{"text":"This place is terrible.  I went for lunch today and ordered the vegetable tofu pad Thai.  I got two pieces of broccoli and two small pieces of tofu and a whole bunch of pad Thai noodles.  This was not worth 10 bucks.  I will never eat here again!"}
{"text":"Great little place, very friendly staff! If you like Thai food u will love this little Canadian Thai spot! It's on John street just east of Leslie in a small plaza with not much going for it! But this Thai spot (and 88) make the plaza worth it! Fast service and lots of parking any time of day or night! Looks very nice, clean, and modern inside! Menu is just the right size! Bunch of soups, long list of Szechuan and obviously curry and fried rice! Check it out if ur in the area"}
{"text":"I have not tried that many Thai food places, so when I went with a large group at lunchtime to Canadian Thai, it was with an open mind.  With a name like Canadian Thai, I was not expecting authentic Thai...but then I wouldn't even know what that was! (Apparently, authentic good Thai is almost non-existing in the GTA...at least that's what the internet buzz is.)  So I can't comment on authenticity, but I can comment on the food.  It was really tasty, the portions were large and the prices at lunchtime were great!   This restaurant was well received by everyone in the group.  Well done Canadian Thai!"}
{"text":"I occasionally pop in here for their lunch special and I'm never disappointed. For less than $12, you get a soup, spring roll and a hefty main course. The mango chicken is my favourite. Be aware that the service is extremely fast and you will get your meal or take out in less than 10 min. You might feel rushed or if you're like me, you might just be excited to get your tasty food."}
{"text":"Do not come in here expecting authentic Thai food. This restaurant is run by Chinese people. We ordered the chicken basil fried rice, chicken pad Thai, and mango sticky rice. The fried rice was good. The pad Thai tasted like it used ketchup as a main ingredient. The mango sticky rice was good, but the quality of the rice isn't what I am use to."}
{"text":"Affordable and delicious, its the best of both world. I ordered the lunch special! 100% worth it. I am going to keep ordering for a long time."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good overall.  I have gone there a few times and it's mainly because I love Thai food and their prices are very affordable.  They have lunch and dinner combo menus and it's really affordable.    That being said, their soup of the day is generally the same and you do not have much of an option there and the salad with the curry combo is not the best.  The red curry itself is amazing.    I am also not satisfied with the customer service.  It's not very homely or a setting where I feel very welcome, I personally find the staff to be slightly rude.  Overall, I do go back for the food.  They give a good amount of food for the price."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I enjoy coming here because of the following:  Price is great - with tip it is about 12 dollars and you get a meal with soup + tea. The lunch meals come with a small side of white rice with cooked vegetables and the meat(shrimp, chicken or beef)   The service is really nice as it is basically a family run place. It gets busy for lunch, so try to come before 12 to get a seat. Service is also fast.  My coworker raves about the pad thai and says it is one of the best she has (with the chicken)   The food is also spiced very well. The corn soup is my favorite, but they also offer a hot & sour soup.  Overall, for 12 dollars it is a great deal and highly recommended. Giving this place 4 stars."}
{"text":"Not happy at all with the soup quantity.  Ordered via skip the dishes  Paid $14 bucks for this water"}
{"text":"Wanted to write a quick review because I would have never stepped into here based on the awning.  My materialistic self, was brought here by a few friends that live in the area.   Immediately after entering the restaurant the decor was pleasant and staff was friendly.   Everything from the water with fresh lemons, the coconut milk based soup and beef salad was delicious.    The beef salad had a great portion of beef, and had the right amount of sour and sweet. I would recommend it as a light meal or appetizer.   The pad thai on other tables looked and smelled great! looked very popular.   My friend ordered the deep fried tofu and the basil eggplant. Both were well seasoned and cooked. The sign that this place takes pride it its work, is the eggplant. Often eggplant can be over cooked or rubbery, but the prep and execution of the dish was on the money.   Look past the microsoft-word looking awning and hit this affordable thai place that is doing things right."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch if you work nearby. The staff are friendly and the lunch specials are pretty good. For the price of a McDonald's take out you can have a decent, sit down lunch. We never went there for dinner but lunch specials are good and food presentation is good too. For the price and the convenience, can't complain much. They do use MSG I think because sometimes after lunch I could feel it. Another thing is that the cook uses oil liberally. Makes the food taste great but not so good for the waistline if you tend to watch your weight carefully. For lunch once in a while, it's a great place. Get there early, because it gets full rather fast as the lunch hour approaches."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to sit down for a meal.  It's fast, service is good and prices are around $10 for lunch.  I usually order the beef fried rice when I go.  For $9.99, it will also come with a veggie deep fried spring roll and a bowl of hot and sour soup.  Their fried rice is a tad greasy but it tastes good.  I would rank this a 3.5 star rating.  Will go back there but not on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Canadian Thai, Chinese-owned, is located in a small strip mall next to a community arena. My mom had wanted to try this place for years, since we pass by it on our way to and back from badminton up at the Sheraton on Highway 7. We finally stopped here on a Friday night to a half-empty parking lot.  We arrived just before 8 pm and the place was full of people. It looks as if this restaurant was recently renovated, as the decor here is nice. It was comfortably warm* and the floor was super clean. Most of the clients look like regulars and the staff here were very friendly and accomodating. We ordered four items, all vegetarian, since the curries and soups all had fish sauce:  1) Rice paper rolls - a few sprouts, lots of rice noodles, but no Thai basil. Fail. 2) Spicy Thai Basil with Eggplant - excessively heavy on the sauce, which had me trying to scape if off the vegetables. The eggplant was perfectly ripe, long beans were cooked well and the celery was fresh. Bare pass. 3) Pad Thai - I think they had a 8-year-old in the kitchen make ketchup noodles for me. Very sour, stingy on the peanut and lime. Epic fail. 4) Mango juice ($2.95) - out of the can, you can't screw this up.  In total, our bill came to $26, which wasn't bad. The service was outstanding and the servers made a great deal of effort to attend to each table, even stopping to chat with the family and ask about their kids. They knew that we weren't regulars, so come time for us to leave, the waitress asked us about our food. Awkwardly, I could only say that the eggplant was too salty. It's really hard to tell someone that your food sucks, especially when we're Chinese and everyone is speaking in Cantonese.   I wouldn't come back here, but wouldn't mind if I was stuck in the area for something to eat. As I said before, I wasn't able to try the curries. Considering how nice the staff was, I wish that their food was better. As my mom puts it in Cantonese, this is just \"the kind of place that tricks white people.\"  *There were several seniors here. I'm not sure if they purposely made it warm for them."}
{"text":"Was here a few months ago. First time trying Canadian Thai. Staff and Service was good!! The accommodated a table for 12, and it did get busy afterwards.  Now to the food.... As mentioned in other reviews, its CANADIAN Thai. If you are expecting authentic Thai, DONT!! Otherwise, nothing wrong with the food.  I like authentic, so i will be going to another place for thai. I will come here for the good service, and decent Canadian food.  :)"}
{"text":"I've been to Canadian Thai a few times, and it's definitely best for lunch. Their specials are comparatively priced and provide quite a fair amount of food and rather quickly, making an ideal lunch for those who need to get back to work quickly.  The food is above average, although I've yet to be impressed by any of their appetizers. The menu also includes a number of Chinese dishes (big surprise). Soups are run-of-the-mill and are nothing special. Mains are of a few basic but tasty varieties and are usually pretty good while coming with a layer of added oil. I haven't tried much of the Chinese food, as the Thai is solid and is usually what comes with lunch and what I go here for. Just an FYI- crispy on the menu = deep fried.  Service here is above average, probably since the place isn't large enough for the wait staff not to be able to see everything going on from any single vantage point. Staff is pleasant and offers to help with the menu despite its simplicity.  Good for an introduction to some of the more basic Thai dishes or as a staple quick lunch. 3-3.5/5."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a cheap and fast lunch.  Lunch menu is small but good choices.  As it's name, it is really Canadian Thai cuisine."}
{"text":"Been here quite a bit. The food is amazing ! My favorite dish has to be the Thai Basil Beef, hands down. One of the best dishes I've tasted in a long time !"}
