{"text":"FRESH, FRESH, FRESH! I tried this place with my wife, last week based on reviews from a local facebook page. Glad we did. Absolutely delicious rare beef pho soup. The broth is flavourful with so many wonderful layers of spices, the veggies were delicious and the noodles perfectly cooked. Wife had the chicken noodle and loved it. Did I mention it was FRESH  Going back today!"}
{"text":"Went there to have Pho, but instead went for the beef veggie and rice.  Great food at affordable prices.  Nice and clean environment."}
{"text":"Ginger pho is okay.

The food here did not blow me away as I expected. Maybe I came in with high expectations and it didn't meet my expectations, but this place can use some help. 

Food: okay, nothing special. For an area with a lot of pho stores. This place would not be my first choice.

Environment: very clean, and for that reason I would consider going back.

Customer Service: Excellent, they spoke English which is nice. Not a lot of pho stores have someone that speaks English. 

OVERALL: I would come back, but I wouldn't go out of my way to make sure I eat here again."}
{"text":"Very good place for a Pho treat! The large portion size of soup noodle is impressive, at least by Asian standard. I took the Large three types of beef(raw, well done and meatball) and my wife took the well-done one....I would recommend the raw beef one."}
{"text":"Big portion meal and plated really well. The meat are well seasoned and my favourite is the Spring roll.. I also like the free peanut appetizer before ordering. Very friendly and accommodating staff. very clean too."}
{"text":"Quite interesting layout for the restaurant. Its attractive from the outside.

Went with co-workers during lunch to check it out. The restaurant was clean, staff was very friendly and knowledgeable and they had decent parking.

I ordered  the Hot & sour Seafood noodle soup, which had shrimps, mussels, squid, fish ball,
crab. I found it quite good.

Overall, good experience."}
{"text":"I didn't want to give this establishment 5 stars because of the higher price compared to other great viet restaurants in the area. My overall experience pushed it from four stars to five. 

Food - 

Free small bowl of beer nuts, yum. Yes, free. They're seasoned with sweet ginger and salted garlic. Not sure why, but there was a nice, welcomed spice to them. You can also purchase these for $1.99 if you want more or some to go. 

The server asked us what we wanted to drink (which is different from regular pho stores), I said tea. I don't know if this is complementary, but it's the same green tea that normally comes to your table at most other pho restaurants. I'll make sure to check my bill next time. 

Pho only comes in small and large sizes. The prices are higher than other pho restaurants in the area. However, it's a price I'm happy to pay since you get the \"free\" peanuts and the place is so clean. The pho here is good. We both got size small (pho dac biet) and felt the portions were correct & veggies came plentiful. He also brought me extra lime as soon as I asked. The noodles and meat were good. The only thing I didn't care for was all the raw onion in the pho (I picked some out). One other thing is that I like my broth smoking hot. It was hot, but not really smoking/steaming hot.  A small bowl of pho dac biet was more than $7, but less than $8. 

2 Spring rolls served on a couple pieces of lettuce with some carrots and nuoc mam to dip. You could tell the oil they fried these in were fresh which made for a good spring roll. Again, a little pricey since it came with 2, but good enough that I'll probably order it again. 

Service - Always good and friendly. They take your order instead of you having to write it down. Checked up on us once during our meal which was nice even though we didn't need anything. Brought everything out quickly. I like their staff. 

Cleanliness - 5 out of 5, reallyyy clean. Really, really clean; which is rare for a pho place. You can bring your non-Asian friends here without them questioning your choice of shady restaurant. 

Also had enough parking spots to accommodate customers. 

Final thoughts - Although it is a bit pricier here, it doesn't bother me thaaat much. It would bother me less if pho con bo wasn't in the area. But on cold days that I'm  feeling bummy and don't want to bump into anyone at pho con bo, I'll definitely be coming here. Which is likely how I'll be feeling a lot. 

I'll also be back to try the worlds largest bowl of pho (dac biet, 16 inch bowl)"}
{"text":"I came here specifically for the ginormous bowl of pho for $40. We had 3 adults and 2 kids and still couldn't finish it. We probably could have had one more adult to finish it. The portion was really good, you got a variety of items that come with the pho : tripe, onions, green onions, rare beef, flank beef, etc... I enjoyed the thickness and texture of the noodles and liked the fact that we were provided with long chopsticks, a laddle, individual spoons and such with no hesitation. The pho soup lacked in flavour so we used more sauce than usual but overall I enjoyed the portion but just wish the soup had more flavour :("}
{"text":"Decided to try the worlds largest pho after seeing it featured on BlogTO and the size portion did not disappoint. It was a large 16 inch bowl that serves 1-4 people. When we walked in, there was a table of two gentlemen that each had one for themselves which was crazy! My friends and I decided to share one and could not even finish it! For $40 you get a lot of noodles and a variety of meat (beef, tendon, beef balls, etc).

As expected, with such big portions it is hard to make a really good broth due to them making big batches constantly and some of the beef for a little dry and chewy. Overall, this place is not bad for a quick bite and if you are craving pho really bad."}
{"text":"Ginger Pho is a bit pricey for this area compare to other Pho restaurants in the same area.  The portion is considerate smaller than other Pho place.  Therefore why pay more for less when there are others to enjoy"}
{"text":"A welcome new place to eat lunch or dinner. Friendly staff and bright interior. Generous portions and flavorful dishes. We've been there twice so far and never have been disappointed .
We are definitely are regulars now!!"}
{"text":"From a Vietnamese food fan I would say this place is probably a bit on the normal side, \"nothing to write home about.\"  Prices are okay. As of this writing the place looks good (recent new opening) and clean. I wouldn't mind being back if I happen to be nearby but wouldn't make my way to it if I were to consider a Vietnamese place to look forward to."}
{"text":"Clean store. People were very nice. Right off the highway, has parking. Overall.... OKAY. 

The food wasn't bad, but wasn't very authentic. The pho had no pho flavour. Had the rice dish with pork chop. The flavour was pretty good but not amazing. 

The portions were decent but not for the price. The rice came out on a huge plate. Plate which made it seem very little. The pork chop was so thin, but wasn't too dry. The rice was over cooked almost had a congee texture. The tofu egg was a sliver. And the \"bi\" wasnt bad. 

Overall the food wasn't bad, but can use alot of improvements. Portions need to be bigger, for the price you pay; since I can go down the street pay the same or less and get a lot more. 

This place I would say is catered to more of a western crowd. But as a Vietnamese person I probably wouldn't go back. Because I think it's overpriced for what you get. There was nothing that made it stand out and was sooo good that made it different from a regular cheap pho store, there was nothing that made me say OMG. I need to come back for this. Because no where else serves it."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time at the Weston Location. Food tastes really good and the portion sizes was great. Price is affordable. Definitely coming back here for Vietnamese food.  Service was also quick. This a great go to place for Pho  for anyone in the North York, Weston area."}
{"text":"New place close to work. Nice and clean, newly opened. Service was nice. However, food is mediocre at best. For the price vs portion, I would not return. I am very picky with my pho, hence the low review. The broth was severely lacking, tasted like water. Doesn't feel like the day long simmered broth should be. Very disappointed, it was so close to work."}
