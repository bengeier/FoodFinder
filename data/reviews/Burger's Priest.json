{"text":"Honestly this is the best burger spot on earth. I've never tasted something so delicious in my life. Thanks for ruining every other burger for me!"}
{"text":"I learned of this establishment from the Canadian locals. The burger was so juicy and tender. I took a bite and the burger literally melted in my mouth.  The fries was crispy and bursting with flavour. It was a grand delectable roller coaster ride for my taste buds. I look forward to my return. http://shugatheroamingreporter.blogspot.com/2014/01/top-5-toronto-must-eat.html"}
{"text":"Food: B+ Service: A Food presentation: A Atmosphere: B Prices: B+ Recommended?:  Yes  A friend has been telling me about the Priest for awhile now and I was happy to find out one has opened uptown just a few days ago. The first thing I noticed was that, interestingly, the Priest is just beside the Burger Cellar which has recently received a generous one start rating from yours truly.   Let's focus on the good first: (I ordered the cheeseburger as I wanted to be able to taste the beef rather than masking the beef flavour with all the other extras) The beef is tasty and looks and tastes fresh as advertised, the bun is incredibly soft and fresh, and the staff seemed friendly. So why three stars? I'm glad you asked..   The bad: This place is cash only which equals inconvenience. The place seemed like an assembly line kind of the same feeling you get when you walk into McDonald's, which was disappointing given the prices. And that reminds me, the cheapest thing on the menu was ~ $ 6 and that got me a tiny cheeseburger (see pic and compare the size to the napkin in the pic), which failed to fill me up. And I have to add that I thought the burger was too oily.... dripping with oil oily. Not sure if the meat is 30% fat or whether they deep fried my burger.   Bottom line, I recommend this place if you're in the neighbourhood and if you had to choose between the Priest and the Burger Cellar. But Golden Star (reviewed earlier) remains my favourite burger joint in the GTA. Golden Star easily beats the priest by portion size, flavour and prices."}
{"text":"Food is ok, but their sanitary practices are not.  The person handling the RAW beef patties was also assembling the burgers.  He touched the bun and vegetables without washing his hands.  This is very serious, since cross contamination of food can lead to severe health issues.  Needless to say, we didn't eat our burgers.    As it was very busy, we didn't want to call out the workers in front of a large crowd, but an email voicing our concerns was not answered.    Doesn't matter if the burgers are good or not if you end up in the hospital with stomach poisoning.  Update: a second email sent to them about the sanitary practice was still not answered.  They definitely don't care what their customers think or their health."}
{"text":"+ Good burgers.  - Overpriced milkshakes.  Average fries.  Cash only. I am sure your margins are high enough to justify card payments. No need to have an ATM inside for alternate source of income."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of chain restaurants but this burger joint is decent, better than five guys. If I had to list my fav chain fast food, this would be #4. Good seasoning on patty, great fries. This location leaves something to be desired. Wendy's baconator still has my heart (attack) though!"}
{"text":"I have been there twice so far in the span of 5 months. For my first experience, I ordered the Religious Hypocrite and was really hooked on the cheese and the deep fried and breaded Portobello mushrooms were to die for!! So delicious! The second time I decided to try another burger and still went for a Secret menu choice, the Tower of Babel because I still wanted one with that delicious cheese ball. It was a massive size and it took me a good 20 minutes to eat it all granted I'm a very slow eater but sooo worth it! I felt so stuffed after but it was definitely a good feeling! Looking forward to trying out other secret menu choices sometime early next year, maybe the Four Hoursemen of the Apocalypse and Judgement Day for 2015! I would go more often but I'm trying not to gain 20 pounds in a matter of a month ahah but I highly suggest trying out a choice from their Secret Menu! It's definitely quite a bit pricey and finding a place to sit is sort of a miracle, but taking it to go is great as well! You wont regret it!"}
{"text":"God had to bless Burger Priest for it's business because it's the most over rated hamburger joint I ever experienced. The burger is a 4oz fried patty that you would find a some local fair. The bun is the white bread bun that one can buy at No Frills. Unbelievable!!! Not worth the place, price or taste. Simply over rated!!"}
{"text":"The burger tastes good, but is small.  Questionable the way they cook them and how they handle the meat.  Just too busy for them not to contaminate. Very confusing and rushed order. Overrated and way too expensive."}
{"text":"I had pretty high expectations about this place, based on the reviews.   We went  on a Saturday around 3pm, which I thought would be safe from big crowds, I was wrong.  The line up was long! or, maybe it seemed long because the place is the size of a bedroom. Seriously crowded and the tables are the size of TV dinner trays - literally!  We found a decent spot but it was SO HOT, uncomfortably hot. You need to be wearing a T Shirt to not break out a sweat  The order/pick up process was a bit confusing and it being so crowded made it worse.   I ordered the High Priest (basically a big mac) - it was okay, just tasted a bit better than a typical big mac, and chilli cheese fries- which were good, nothing special, got a Dr Pepper with it too. The total was about $20.00 which is pretty high considering it was a burger and fries in a crappy atmosphere  I tried my boyfriends Vatican burger, which was better than my High Priest burger. I think he may have had a better experience with this place than I did.  I dont think I would go back again"}
{"text":"There is always a line here, but it moves fast.  The burgers are delicious, inexpensive, and ready quickly, and the vibe is young, eclectic, and a little rebellious. Love it!"}
{"text":"After selling 600 patties in three hours on the opening night of The Priest's North Toronto location, I'm glad I waited for a lunch visit. Of course, I didn't wait too long! It's day two of their operations, and at 2pm, the place was busy, but we didn't have to wait long for our meals and we were able to snag stools.  While I've been to their Beaches location only once, it seems like they translated The Priest pretty well. The decor is a little more polished (the black ceiling tiles are nice), there's some Hebrew on the wall, and a few more seats to accommodate the crowds.  BP fans will be happy to note that the food is also the same; a loosely-packed patty with a fine grind, fried on a flat top. Ordered a cheeseburger and chili-cheese fries, aware that these aren't the best cures for a cold, but I got 'em anyway. Was going to go big with a coffee shake (nothing says love to a cold like sugar, caffeine, and dairy!), but they're not available until next week. Saved by The Priest, today.  Why only three stars? The bread is perfect, the taste of the beef is nice, but I really don't like the loose-pack for a patty. I find the texture mushy and not to my taste. The meat is great for the chili-cheese fries though! All-in-all, a decent meal, but I'm clearly not of the flat-top burger contingent. If you're one of them though, BP's new location shouldn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Heard lots of good thing about this place and we got the chance to drop by today and try out these famous burgers, after a long day tired and hungry, we had the high priest burgers...such a big disappointment for so high expectation, the burger was so dry and tasteless, the fries are dry and salty not even a bit crunchy...this is our first and also our last....."}
{"text":"Visited Burger's Priest with the GF one sunny Sunday afternoon. We were unable to make a family BBQ which left us craving burgers.  The first thing you will notice upon entering Burger's Priest is their religious theme menu with selections such as \"High Priest\" and \"The Vatican.\" Hopefully the second thing you will notice is that they only accept cash. One of the other patrons in line caught without cash, like us, asked the staff whether they knew it was the year 2016. Why do they only accept cash? I can think of a few reasons but do not want to speculate however considering the prices I found it ridiculous.  Returning to Burger's Priest with cash in hand we both ordered the \"High Priest\" with fries and a drink.  **Disclaimer** if you enjoy such restaurants as Holy Chuck you may wish to take the rest of this review with a grain of salt.  The \"High Priest\" is Burger's Priest version of the Big Mac. An interesting concept because the Big Mac costs roughly $4-5 dollars while the High Priest cost $10. I question whether a \"high end\" burger joint should be trying to replicate the taste of McDonalds. Why would I not just go to McDonald's and pay significantly less money?  The burger meat itself is where I hoped there would be a significant difference. Unfortunately, just like Holy Chuck, I found the beef extremely greasy and soft, basically mushy. I don't care how high grade, organic or fresh the meat is. It is borderline inedible, mushy and excessively greasy.   Our two \"Big Mac\" combos cost us approximately 34 dollars. Insane. I cannot see the allure of this place and will not visit again."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had. I just had the regular cheeseburger and it was amazing. The bun was perfect, the meat was so moist and they nailed the toppings. My husband, on the other hand, had the Vatican, which is a double cheeseburger with grilled cheese sandwiches on the top and bottom instead of a bun. I had one bite and that was probably enough for me, but that one bite was heavenly. You probably have to be in a certain mood to be able to eat it. There are plenty of other things on their secret menu, which you can google to find. Yes, it's all a bit precious, with a secret menu, and the in-store menu not being terribly descriptive, but I can look past the silly gimmicks when the burger is this delicious. Fries are pretty good and a generous portion. We shared one order of fries and were satisfied. Interior of the restaurant is small, so this is probably best as a to-go treat."}
{"text":"It was awhile back when I tried this so I forgot what I even ate. All I remember besides the great burger and shake I had was the line up was stupid long, it was ridiculous, but the burger was absolutely worth the waiting. Yes, the price is high. But I can afford it :P and for anyone else who can, and do not mind shelling out some bucks over high quality burgers, it's well worth the bucks.   I still need to try more homemade burger spots in Toronto to really judge and see where Burger's Priest ranks but atm, it is up there for me. We shall see."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today as everyone was raving about it. So what did I think??? Well this is a difficult review as I really have no complaints about my food but at the same time I don't see myself going back.   The Burger:  Tasted exactly like what I have at home. Fresh, juicy and all the toppings I want. Yes it tasted great and I have no complaints about it but the reason I buy a Big Mac or a burger from Harveys is because they have a unique taste that I can't make at home. Some might say that's because they are mass produced and not fresh- Yes maybe but they sell 2.4 million Big Macs a day so I guess people like that \"commercial taste\"     The Milkshake: Tasted great, but again,  tasted exactly like what I make at home and I don't mean close to it I mean \"Exactly\"  Chocolate ice cream and milk. Yes I know you're all saying  \"that's what a milkshake is you idiot\" however if I go to Harveys I can't make that milkshake at home, not even close, and that's made with real ice cream.   The fries: No before you say it, I couldn't make these at home. Nor would I want to they are disgusting. Also tried the chili cheese fries.  Just as awful.      So overall the food is fresh and taste ok but I think I'll stay at home next time and fire up the BBQ."}
{"text":"Overpriced and overrated. This place is so much up its own ### it can't get that it's product isn't that special. Burgers are small and very normal. Gourmet or Hero burger are better sans the attitude of this place."}
{"text":"I have seen bigger phone booths than this eatery....My date and I braved the cold and waited..!  I never had to wait for a burger before...but was curious having had burgers all over N. America ...The crowd was as curious as us and they accept only CASH !  ....I ordered the \"Priest\" and the \"Chili Fries\"...we  clutched our paper bag and hustled to our car....the fat reminded me to change my oil , and neatness did not count eating this fare.....All I can say that it was juicy and flavorful....  I saw the McDonald's across the street and grew envious of a spacious table to chow down.... I will not return, the pain of waiting ....ordering and waiting some more did not justify my discomfort..or outlay of $$"}
{"text":"I had the double cheeseburger. It was good, but not as delicious as I expected based on reviews. The burger was 4 stars, the price-quality ratio is why it only gets 3. If you're into the glorified fast food joints like p&l burger, hero burger etc., you'll enjoy this spot quite a bit."}
{"text":"Holy cannoli where have I been all this time without burger priest?! I had the Magnum and my mom got Peter's Denial. Magnum was amazeballs, if you like blue cheese this is your bestfriend! Peter made a mistake denying this bad boy cause i would gladly accept juicy chicken smothered with gravy and sweet corn."}
{"text":"Great Burgers, one of the best I've had so far. Had the Option and it was so delicious. Wish it was not so expensive so I could dine there more often."}
{"text":"Get the \"Big Mac\" called the High Priest, get the Cheese Fries and enjoy the best burger in Toronto."}
{"text":"An amazing secret!  So this is more or less a little hole in the wall, but it's a hole in the wall with incredible cheeseburgers which is all that matters!  Delicious burgers with what has the taste and feel of natural beef rather than pre packed garbage- it's worth the slightly longer than average wait for a burger trust me! Always juicy - definitely worth a visit if you've never tried it, just be prepared with cash no cards accepted, that being said they have an atm on site.  Enjoy a cheat day and try a burger!"}
{"text":"A wonderfully juicy burger with great toppings. Come and clog your arteries here. It's worth the extra work out."}
{"text":"This is definitely my new favourite place to go for burgers. Burgers are absolutely delicious and I would go back again and again on nice days when I don't mind possibly having to wait outside the door in the lineup or eating outside due to the lack of seating.  The stuff on the secret menu is cool and all, but I don't suggest ordering something like the four horsemen of the apocalypse. Maybe if you can split it with a friend and don't mind paying $20 for a burger though. It's basically like having 2 burgers but with less bun. You'd most likely end up having to eat that with a knife and fork or with your hands, which will get pretty messy."}
{"text":"If you haven't looked at their secret menu online, don't bother ordering any food. It's definitely not worth getting the 5 items displayed when all the good stuff is hidden. It does kinda suck if you don't know there's a secret menu and you have a not so great experience like my boyfriend.   I got \"The Pope\" which was delish and although it was extremely filling, I didn't get that gross feeling when you normally eat greasy food. I'm guessing it's because of the freshness of the meat and it having no fillers.   I saw this restaurant on tv which led me here, although the prices are quite expensive and they don't have actual combos, it is definitely somewhere I will come back too..who can say no to a delish cheeseyburger?!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this burger joint after hearing all the buzz about it but was pretty disappointed. Came here on a Wednesday night and the place was pretty busy and there are very little seats. Ordered a cheesburger combo with fries and the cookie ice cream sandwich. The cheeseburger was moist but lacked flavor and thickness, the fries were mediocre at best and the ice cream was really bland and the cookie was hard. Probably would not come back here again by choice, there are much better burger joints out there."}
{"text":"Well, after trying the burger cellar next door and being highly disappointed, I decided to try this place out next time I was craving a burger.   I'm a little torn on this review though.  Burger taste: 5 stars!  Fries: 5 stars!  Establishment: 1 star Value: 2.  The reason for the bad value rating is that my burger (a single)  was literally the size of a McDonald's cheeseburger. I'm not kidding! The bun was so small, but boy was it delicious.   I felt that any normal person would be required to get a double, and at the cost of nearly $10 for the burger alone that should not be the case.   The fries were some of the best I've had in a long time.  The establishment itself only had tiny tables and many people had nowhere to sit.   If you're in the area, you have to give this place a try. Don't even consider the neighboring burger cellar.  However if you have to drive, consider The Works as they beat both of these establishments in almost every way."}
{"text":"Best fast food burger in the city. I've had the cheeseburger, the option, and Peter's Denial along with every flavour of milkshake. The burgers are super greasy and will definitely put you in a food coma but they are well worth it. The option is the vegetarian patty and unlike anything at other restaurants - it is a deep fried cheesy/mushroom ball of goodness. Milkshakes are also think and creamy with real flavours (particularly the strawberry). A must try!!"}
{"text":"If you like burgers and you haven't been here. I suggest you hurry your ass up. Directly influenced by IN N OUT in California. It has its own spin on it and the high priestess rivals the bigmac"}
{"text":"If you're going to go through the trouble of mashing the canned corn at least strain the water off the corn mush before pouring it on my burger.   My bottom burger bun disintegrated by the time I sat down on the worlds smallest stool to eat it ... at a dirty table ... If it wasn't so crazy busy, I would've asked for a knife/fork to enjoy it but you couldn't move in there.  Maybe a nicer crusty bigger bun would have been able to withstand the soaking.    Good for them. Business is good.  I'll go another time when it's non-peak time so I can enjoy a burger without someone's ass right there because there was literally no where else to stand."}
{"text":"Had the California burger and fries with my buddy just now. We both think the burgers were way too greasy -I mean grease dripping everywhere. Nothing special about the burgers except that they were tiny and super greasy, not very tasty either. Fries were OK, kind of like what you get from a hot dog van, but the oil they used to fry the fries looked dark brown... Very dark brown. All I have now after eating at this place is a feeling of hunger and the horrible burnt oil aftertaste"}
{"text":"I agree with some of the other comments. This place might have been hyped up a bit too much. Don't get me wrong, they make a pretty mean burger, if you like a big greasy burger, which I do, but in terms of value, I'd rather have In-N-Out burger over this any day of the week."}
{"text":"This place has quite the hype about being an amazing burger place, and quite honestly it lives up to those standards as i have been a loyal customer for about a year now, visiting once every month or so. The burgers are absolutlely juicy, with a consistently tender and tasty patty, which is in between two soft bread buns. Whether it's the regular burgers or the secret menu items, the burger's quality has always been consistent, never any problems with the burgers. The burger's are quite different from regular burgers from harvey's as the buns and patty are a lot more compact and lighter, yet they are a lot more flavourful in taste. Burger's priest is a must go to place if your a burger lover like me! The only reason why i am giving 4 stars is because the prices are pretty steep, and the secret menu items are expensive!"}
{"text":"I went to this location for the first time months ago after listening to evey1 rant and hype it up forever.  I've never been one to buy into hype, which is why I probably didn't try this place right away.  I'm not a fan of spending $10 on a burger either, but such is the way it is in Toronto these days..  I forget what I ordered, but it tasted like McDonalds - I don't eat fast food ever - so not good.  Although the texture of the burger was good.  I thought to myself, maybe it was just this one burger I got.  I went again and the actual patty quality was good again, but the overall taste left in my mouth was like I just ate a BIG super greasy McDonalds burger.  I also tried their cheesy fries this time..due to my health I don't get to treat myself to cheesy goodness often..and I was quite disappointed in how it tasted like amateur hour potatoes with dinky cheese melted on top. We can all do a better job ourselves on that one!  IF the McDonalds across the street were to advertise that they too ground their meat on site every day, I would consider paying half the price there to have the same taste left in my mouth.."}
{"text":"My family loves burgers and this has become a Friday night staple in our house. They are not big burgers but they are delicious. There is very little eat in place so ewe always get take out. While it is always busy it does move quickly."}
{"text":"I love a good burger but my latest experience at the Priest was a big disappointment! I have been to the Priest a couple of times in the past but something sure has changed. What is that deep fried cheese fondue ball that is meshed on top of the burger. The cheese ball oozed all over the burger and a meager smattering of lettuce and a couple tomato heels just does not cut it!! All I wanted was a \" CLASSIC BURGER \" A good beef patty with a slice of cheese, tomato, mustard & relish. You couldn't get any more basic than that!! Get rid of the fried cheese ball. I was also getting a Vegetarian Burger to go as well. To my surprise the Veggie patty has been replaced by the cheese ball.The Priest was great year and half ago. What has happened!? I support local business in Toronto and do not like writing bad reviews because they can hurt a business. The Priest should go back to it's original recipe that made them stand out from the crowd in the increasingly competitive gourmet burger market. I won't go back to the Priest for awhile but I won't count them out.  I believe and hope the Priest will make it back."}
{"text":"Ya these are the best burgers and their fries are heaven. Be aware of long line ups and have your order ready and quick but then again theres not much to choose from so you should know. Gym will be calling your name following your meal. As we felt really bloated and lazy after.  Burger Priest Coma. Every Torontonian must try it out."}
{"text":"Really great burgers. The service is really slow (about 20-30 mins just for one burger) even when it's not very busy.   Love their California Classic (which is around $7 for a single and $9 for a double beef patty). Their milkshakes are also good. I particularly enjoy their regular and malted chocolate milkshakes. Around $3.99-regular and $4.99-malted.  The location is not very spacious either. But amazing burgers!"}
{"text":"Over rated in my opinion. A real burger to me is flame broiled. I don't see what the hype is about this place. It's overpriced for what it is. I would compare it to five guys burgers. I guess everybody has different preferences."}
{"text":"After the much awaited hype..We finally went to try their burgers last Thursday after work...First of all, I'm not a burger gal but the \"Secret Menu\" intrigued me. The decor of the place added more fascination and if anything even make me want to order more..or it might just be me? The place was crowded but with somewhat good ambiance..  Anyway, I tried the \"Holy Smokes\" Burger from the Secret Menu and boy was I right! The burger was cooked just the way I wanted it..and the kick from the jalapeno peppers fit right in...the chocolate shake was amazing..and the fries were unexpectedly a lot...Overall it was a recommendable meal..price is reasonable for the amount and taste of the food!"}
{"text":"The cashier was rude when we went yesterday.  Had to repeat order several times for her to get it right. And to go with her incompetence, there is attitude, how lovely.  Burgers were OK.  Vatican City is just so heavy and greasy - when you order a double-burger, one expects this, but the oily double grilled cheese, it was kind of gross.  Prime Rib burger at Milestone's is better for the money."}
{"text":"As a meat eater: I had \"the priest\" burger. The burger patty itself was not that spectacular. It was a \"slightly better than your first attempt\" homemade burger. I came here expecting to be wowed by the quality of the burger meat itself, but it was overshadowed by the \"option\"...  If you're a vegetarian: Then you want to try this place! The \"option\" which is this fried, cheesy portabello mushroom patty is delicious. It is really deep fried though.  I added \"smoke\" to my burger which were fried jalapeno peppers. Pass it up, it just added some extra fried crunchiness and raw jalapeno flavour. I suppose I'd have preferred a more pickled flavour to complement the patty. It just stood out as a random flavour in my burger.  There was nothing special with the mayo or anything. No tasty spices or extra touches in the burger. It was just good quality meat. A good burger. Nothing to write home about. If you're vegetarian, check out the \"option\". That's all I can say."}
{"text":"This is a special place for us, we came here the day before our wedding and have been coming back since. I love the Vatican but tried the priest today and my husband had the Canadian maple bacon burger, which was amazing.  The burgers are pretty much the best! I love that they are greasy goodness and love the concept of the priest! We good Catholics today, we went to mass first  and then worshipped the burger!!"}
{"text":"Is The Burger Priest a classic American burger joint? HELL YES, I mean heavenly YES! I have been hearing through the grape vines all about this burger joint. To myself, all I thought, geez ANOTHER one of these little spots opened up. Toronto was giving birth to burger joints all over - the trend of 2011. Which one will survive?  Everyone and their mother kept bragging to me about this \"Burger's Priest.\" So, guess what we did it!  Growing up in central Etobicoke, my religious burger joint was Apache Burgers. Even when I moved out to the suburbs when I craved a burger, I would head to the Kipling and Dundas area to get my fix. However, can't say I have been there recently to make the judgment if it's still any good like back in the day.  I skipped out on breakfast just knowing my calorie intake was going to be off the roof. My stomach in starvation mode and my taste buds just utterly excited. I was ECSTATIC!  Walk in and there is a small sitting area at the right side of the square shaped store. Bar stools for you to sit on as you devour your meal.  2012 meets 1970s (not like I know what the 70s where like but according to my imagination this is what it would be like). Now, as we waited in further anticipation for our order of The High Priest (double stacked Priest), The Vatican (not listed on the menu) and The Option to join with us.  We couldn't help but over hear a customer come in and ask for a burger, which wasn't on the menu, however, she didn't know the name of it and just described it. The staff's response was \"We don't know what you are talking about Ma'am, you must know the name in order to get it.\" There is a hidden menu in which Torontonians have to discover all through word of mouth in order to enjoy the deliciousness of unique burger not listed on the written BP menu. On the classic menu you will find yourself deciding between cheeseburgers, double cheeseburgers (recognized on the menu as 'the double'), veggie burger made of fried Portobello mushrooms stuffed with cheese (referred to as 'The Option'). Than there is 'The Priest' which is basically an option plus a cheeseburger. Simple menu, yes, it's a burger joint what else do you want?! Oh yes, fries exist too, fresh cut daily AND never frozen. All the burgers start from a custom blend of ultra premium beef which is ground in house throughout the day and rolled into a 4 ounce of deliciousness aka balls with just a sprinkle of salt and pepper. The patties are cooked on a flat- top griddle.  The Burger's Priest solution \"Fresh ground beef, soft bun, simple toppings, griddled to perfection.\"  So now to the juicy part of the story, \"the experience.\" As soon as I saw the Vatican my mouth started to drool - two grilled cheese sandwiches made from bun with two cheeseburgers. The most perfect hung over burger. It is everything like it sounds like, heavy, cheesy, delicious, and mouth watering. A little too much cheese for me. But I can definitely understand why it is a secret favourite amongst many.  McDonald's Big Mac in a real bun with real patty's. This was JUST HEAVEN in my mouth. Literally! I have always been a huge fan of the Big Mac since the early 90's McD's. However, not so much anymore as McDonald's doesn't make them the same. Craving a Big Mac, don't even bother go to the golden arch, get into your car and get to The Burger Priest and order yourself \"The High Priest.\" Double stacked (two beef patties), special sauce, lettuce, cheese all compressed between a non-sesame seed bun. This one is a MUST to try!  Than came \"The Option\" to try, which is a veggie burger made out of fired cheese stuffed Portobello mushrooms. It was a favourite amongst one of us, however I yet found it to be too much cheese. A big fan of portobello mushrooms, I did enjoy it. For the non meat lover, this is definitely an ideal hang over alternative burger choice. If I didn't enjoy my meat so much I would travel for this deliciousness especially if you are a cheese lover.  It is to no surprise why The Burger Priest has become a trendy spot."}
{"text":"I actually like this burger... which is a bit unusual for me, because i'm not much of a burger fan. The ingredient quality seems good, and that deep fried mushroom is special. :)"}
{"text":"Tried many \"upscale\" burger places and this one still gives me goosebumps. I even received a $60 parking ticket which made my total purchase $90. That's still cheaper than a night out with my wife."}
{"text":"I love Burger's Priest.  I could eat here once a week.  This was my first visit to the 'new' location on Yonge. The only major difference between this location and the original on Queen East is the bar stool seating, which is a nice option to have when it's cold out.  But seats be damned, I still prefer the original location. There's just something I enjoy about standing shoulder-to-shoulder in a hole-in-the-wall and then eating a juicy burger on the curb, while walking home, or in a nearby park.  Still the best burger I have eaten in Toronto."}
{"text":"I love this place. The burgers are as good as people say! Add the smoke (deep fried jalapenos). Fries could be better, they are a bit soggy. Cookies are delicious. Would be 5 stars if the wait wasn't so long every time. The Lawrence location should take call in orders."}
{"text":"I would give thIs place a solid 4. I went on a Monday and was surprised to see that it was full! I ordered the double cheeseburger and fries and the patty was so moist and so fresh. I would of gotten something with The Option on it but I wasn't daring enough nor was I hungry enough. I suggest trying something off of their \"secret menu\" - http://www.foodwithlegs.com/burger-priest-secret-menu/"}
{"text":"Great freshly made burger. Tasty milk shake.  It'd be better if the place was larger.  Staffs are nice.  Hope to see a longer hours, to accommodate those who live uptown. Or it'd be even better if there's an uptown branch open near Sheppard/ Yonge or Finch/ Yonge."}
{"text":"I was expecting a lot based on all the Yelp reviews and countless top Toronto burger acclaims from various writers. The burgers in my opinion were barely any better than a Wendy's burger.   I had the Priest burger. This has a deep fried mushroom cheese patty in the middle of the burger. The fried mushroom cheese patty was absolutely disgusting. This overwhelmed the entire burger with a disgusting fried taste of cheese. Even after taking this out, the burger was so so. The patty was very small, and for the price paid, a terrible deal.  The fries were also underwhelming, with little to no seasoning, and no distinctive taste to them.  Based on the long wait, and high price menu for a burger I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"The MOST pretentious staff at a fast food joint that I ever had to deal with. Maybe this sort of attitude works with customers at the Lawrence location, Canada's wealthiest neighbourhood, but you cant be pulling this sort of nonsense 10 minutes away from the jungle. When the average burger without fries or drink costs about 10$, the last thing a customer wants is a pretentious attitude that yells \"we're more important than you; you came to see us, we could not care less about you.\" The other day I came in at 10:45 cause I saw the place was packed with people. I figured they were open late or something. As I walked in no one bothered to greet me, so I stepped forward and browsed their menu. After I was done looking and went closer to order, the half-dozen or so staff jumped to the counter like they were trying to attack me or something and one by one proceeded in a high-pitched tone to let me know they were closed. So rather than acknowledge my presence in the first place or suggest a menu item that doesnt require the kitchen staff, like a sundae, they instantly chose to try to kick me out as quickly as possible. Definitely never coming back here. With that kind of attitude, I don't see this place lasting for more than a year or two. Once the hype wears off, it'll be left to the locals, who aren't going to be dealing with this crap. The only real customers here are those perhaps on their way to Yorkdale, but even then, the food court has so much variety that it's probably not even going to be worth the time to go out of one's way to come here. This place can go take the rich folk entitlement attitude elsewhere cause ain't gonna be tolerated here."}
{"text":"The menu at Burger's Priest can be a bit confusing; I would recommend double-checking everything when you place your order. I always get the \"Priest\" (cheeseburger + portobello mushroom)"}
{"text":"Really expensive for a burger that is sub par even to Wendy's. Fries are terrific.     But the patty is dry and tasteless.  Condiments are skimpy. The bun is boring Space is like military chow house or worse. I don't get their popularity. Save yoUr money & get a Big Mac."}
{"text":"Just not my thing. The burger (double cheeseburger) was dripping with fat. I probably would have loved this when I was 14 like most of the other customers when I visited, but not at 30.  If the biggest greasiest burgers are your thing, than this place is a 4.5."}
{"text":"Yum.  Just yum.  I stupidly had the Red Sea.  Chili on a burger always sounds like a great idea and it just never works.  It was good, but the chili just makes a mess and overwhelms the burger.  I was still hungry when it was done.  Then I tried my sister's burger as she couldn't quite finish.  Not sure which one she had but it came with the roasted portabello mushrooms.  It was phenomenal.  I wish I'd listened to her and had one as well.  She's visiting me in a few weeks and may have to stow one in her suitcase for me.    I went out for dinner with a friend that night and told her I'd been to a burger place on Yonge St but couldn't remember the name.. she shouted Burger Priest!  The word is out on these guys.."}
{"text":"This place gets a solid 4.5 for me.   People focus on so many of the wrong things when judging a burger (like the decor of the place, the lack of specific toppings, food handling etc.) I don't care if my burger was manhandled by a homeless man (actually a few downtown are my friends :P), but it doesn't take a bovine expert to know a good burger patty that's done right! And burger priest does their patties right.  I don't get how people can complain about greasy burgers when you're going to a burger joint. Go elsewhere and order a vegan meatloaf instead. I've frequented enough burger joints (to warrant a triple bypass surgery) to know BP isn't just a hype. While my favourite burger is still from Goody's Diner (which sadly closed down) BP is a close second!   Now only if their fries and milkshakes were better, I'd give them a full 5!"}
{"text":"Since discovering the original burgers priest  years ago I have not had take out burgers anywhere else.  I just don't see the point.  This is the best burger you will ever have hands down.  The fries aren't great, but you go their for the burgers so who cares."}
{"text":"I wonder if the commenter who mentions that they handle raw beef and touch other things knows that you can eat raw beef. Their sanitary practices could not be that bad if they're not only still open, but have never been closed because of health and safety issues.   Burger Priest is wonderful. Their burgers are juicy and cheesy, and their veggie burger is also top notch (which is more than the majority of burger places can say)."}
{"text":"I was at the Yonge / Lawrence Burger's Priest location today for the first time. As others have noted, it's small. There is a small amount of counter space available for people to eat, but when we arrived (around 1pm on a Tuesday) the seating was almost entirely full.  I got the Pope burger (one of the many \"secret\" options) which is two patties and \"the option\" (the cheese-stuffed mushroom). I think one of the blessings and curses that BP received was its Zagat selection. People come in with sky-high expectations and are disappointed. I tried to keep my expectations reasonable, and was entirely satisfied with the burger. It wasn't gigantic but it was big enough for me and it tasted great. Some people may not like the mushroom-cheese \"option\" but I really enjoyed it. Next time I'll try the Vatican (grilled-cheese sandwiches replace the buns). The fries were okay (normal burger joint fries).  The service was fast and friendly (although I probably went at one of the slower times of the week). The only reason it loses a star is the price. My total for the Pope burger and fries (no drink) was $17. That's pretty pricey, but even so I'm sure I will return :)"}
{"text":"I live near here 5min walk, after comin here at least 10x already;the price fades off an you get use to it.  The tendency to eat burgers also fades away when you go to other burger places. ITS JUST WAAY TO DEREISHOUS! get a Quad Vatican City extra grilled cheese bun in between less oil = heaven. Or the Pope extra meat :) great place for a quick eat an sleep :D by far the best burger joint in toronto."}
{"text":"Legit burger fat guy approved. Awesome fries too. Thanks for coming to the west. Great condiment selection. Fast and efficient service"}
{"text":"Imagine craving a burger from Burger Priest all day and go into order and be told that they HAVE NO BURGERS LEFT!!!  Wow is all i can say. No apologize. Burger Cellar next door would have definitely compensated me"}
{"text":"A small establishment with Big Taste! I usually get the basic Cheese Burger which is juicy and tasty. The fries are also very good. They only accept cash so make sure to bring some before you get there and the seating area is limited. Depending on when you go it may be hard to get a seat...but that is testament to their success. One of the better burgers in Toronto."}
{"text":"Hurts my heart ! This place was horrible ! This may be the worst burger ive ever had ! Over priced and terrible ! What a disappointment ! So greasy almost like they dropped my burger in the deep fryer ! No flavor ! Ever heard of seasoning ? Did I mention that it was super greasy !!!???"}
{"text":"This place has really good burgers, and that's probably an understatement.  I came here on a Friday night at 9pm and it was still packed with people. Judging from fellow Yelp-mate reviews, I knew I had to go for the Vatican burger. It's a huge burger and I barely finished it, but every bite was a taste of heaven. Cheese is melted with your patties, and if that wasn't enough, you have cheese buns to top it off. The meat is tender, and it doesn't get nasty when you're halfway done.  Tip: because the burgers are freshly made, eat it at the store. You won't regret it. :)"}
{"text":"Complete disappointment. When I asked about the cheeseburger with the special sauce on the secret menu, the order taker just shook her head, like she didn't know what I was talking about. Ended up ordering regular cheeseburger with fries and cheese.  What a snore the burger was and the fries were cold and the cheese was hard.  Never returning!!!"}
{"text":"I finally went to go to see what all the hipe was all about. We arrived around 2pm thinking it wouldn't be busy, well we were wrong. There wasn't one table or seat to be had. I'm thinking great because this means the food is great. Well was I ever disappointed. The food and I mean the burger and fries come with extra grease. How disgusting. I felt like I was swallowing a side of grease with each bite. I said to my husband who is a regular customer, really? This food doesn't hold a candle to McD's. McD's still has the best fries ever. Sorry but I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place was so over-hyped by the time I arrived I was expecting the burger to change my life and regret my lifestyle choices up to this point. I ordered a basic burger, and I found it good, not great. I prefer the Burger Cellar just up the street."}
{"text":"I got the priest... Cheeseburger with the option as a topping. Its $9.99 but wow the patty was so tasty and juicy, the option (which is portbello mushrooms stuffed with cheese and deep fried) was gooey with cheese and the flavour was great too. Would get 5 stars if it were a bit cheaer.  My companion got the religous hippocrate, which is the option with bacon. He loves it, it's one of his go-to. I didn't try it, so i cannot comment."}
{"text":"I dropped by at 6pm which seems to be prime time for lining up here! It was 40 min between lining up and getting my burger! I ordered off their secret menu, Jarge-style because I miss my in-n-out animal style burger and I went for the Priest which is the beef patty plus a deep fried mushroom stuffed with cheese....omg. I should only be allowed to eat this once a year unless I want to gain weight. It is deliciously fatty.  So it is a great fresh burger with fresh ingredients. But damn, $12 is a steep price to pay. I still struggle to want to part with that much, for something I can make or used to be able to get around the corner in Cali for $3!  So it's good, once in a long while, and I'd still look forward to it south of the border than here at Burger's Priest."}
{"text":"How is it taking long to make my burger! You might as well shop on Orfus, get a car wash before you get your burger. Worse burgers priest by far!"}
{"text":"A burger joint is based on 1 thing:  1) TASTE  And these burgers sure do taste amazing, Ive had alot of burgers around the world and these rank among top 3. Its all about the patty, super juicy and just well cooked (using the smash technique i believe). Buns are plain jane, but super soft.   A little pricey sure... Place could be bigger but im judging the burgers and they were suberb. Fries were great too not soggy at all.  Good Service too.. too bad its so far out from downtown."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers. Not much room to sit and eat but totally worth it for the taste.  Fries are soggy Swish Chalet type mmm and burgers are tender and juicy.  Try the secret menu,  Vatican - double cheeseburger with 2 Grilled cheese for buns High Priest - Big Mac style tasty buger"}
{"text":"After many years of being told I had to try a burger from this place, I finally got around to it today, but I wish I hadn't. It's not that the burger was bad, it's that it wasn't even remotely impressive. I just had a cheeseburger, which cost me $6 and was about 3 bites. It's somewhere on par with a Wendy's Junior Bacon Cheeseburger, minus the bacon. Not bad, but pretty \"meh\" as far as burgers go. I would've much rather had the 3 or 4 JBCs I could've gotten for the same price, because at least those would've filled me up.   I also got their $4 fries, which actually were tasty, but there wasn't a single fry in the bag that was over an inch long, while most were little 1cm nubs. When I order fries, I don't expect to get the leftovers of every other batch of fries made earlier in the day.  I'm glad I finally got to eat at this place just so I can tell people where to stick it when they tell me I need to eat here. It's just overpriced and undervalued hipster food. Give me Harvey's over this any day."}
{"text":"The Burger's Priest: Vatican City Style!  Yesterday I had a monster burger craving after watching Burger Wars Toronto on TV. The three competitors were The Burger's Priest, Dangerous Dan's and Parts and Labour.   Although Parts and Labour won it, I decided to scratch my burger itch at The Burger's Priest on Yonge.   The line wasn't as long as I expected for a Labour Day Monday - but it was out the door for a noon hour lunch.   I glanced at the wall and realized the secret menu wasn't so secret anymore.  Having ordered The Pope (the standard Priest burger but with two beef patties instead of one) in the past, I decided to be more adventurous and order the heart-stopping Vatican City.   The Vatican City consists of two four-ounce beef patties (freshly ground), processed cheese, lettuce, ketchup, mayo, mustard, pickles, and onions - all between two grilled cheese sandwiches as buns.      Yes, it is greasy but this fact can be overlooked by it's deliciousness.   The beef patties have the right consistency - lightly pressed so that they don't fall apart too easily but aren't too dense. Made of a custom blend of premium beef, they exude great beef flavour.  They also aren't overly salted for a burger as decadent as this.     The fixings are nothing fancy, but they activate those hard wired impulses that tell us what a burger should be like.   Complaints:  The burger wasn't as high as I'd envisioned it to be - certainly not how it looked in its stock photo on the secret menu. It was disappointing. It could have been attributed to the very flat grilled cheese buns - they were more like pancakes and they weren't as large in diameter as I was hoping for.  I'm not sure if they add anything to the overall experience. I would also rather have a premium cheddar in the grilled cheese buns than processed - I would pay for the difference.   The burger is also missing a crunch factor. I regretted not getting The Tower of Babel- which is The Vatican City but with an Option added.   The Option The Option consists of two Portabello mushrooms and cheese deep fried in a Panko batter. I feel like this is the signature \"option\" that separates The Burger's Priest from other burger joints. Every crunchy bite into the Option results in amazing mushroom flavour along with ooey, gooey cheese.  In fact, it should be added to all burgers to get the true Burger's Priest experience!    Overall:  The Burger's Priest still features some of the best burgers in Toronto."}
{"text":"Food- Great! One of the best burgers i've had. One of the best malt chocolate shakes ever! Chilli fries were ok. Nothing special.  Price- Acceptable but only cash. The ATM in the store was broken and we had to leave store to find an ATM.  Venu- Very cramped. Tables were very small. It's not a place to sit and enjoy your meal. If you are clostrophobic, take your food to go or eat elsewhere.   Staff- nothing special.   Summary- dining experience was less than pleasant. I would only go back if i really craved their burger."}
{"text":"Average burger for above average price. Consistent quality, tasty beef, fresh toppings and awesome soft fluffy buns. I am a purist and order the double cheeseburger. The fries are terrible and the cookies in the jar are usually burnt on the bottom. Service varies from rude to adequate."}
{"text":"This place is a marvel. Such delicious cheeseburgers. The burgers may not be very big but the flavour and texture pack quite the punch and are always satisfying. My only complaint is the milkshakes. They are good and definitely near the top of my list of Great Shakes but the chocolate ice cream is a bit weak flavoured. Still, much better than other shakes I've had. The number one reason to come here is their glorious double cheeseburger."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST burger I had in my LIFE.  Their burger was melt in your mouth, the bun fresh. And the fries so addictive. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the food.  Note its a small place so be prepared to eat out or arrive a little early."}
{"text":"We had to get a burger fix ASAP as it's been a while since we've had one (over a week) and we wanted to check out the new location on Yonge & Lawrence.  If you're a burger-lover in Toronto, you would have been to or at least heard of the Burgers Priest.   This location is double the size of the Beaches location with a bit more room for people to dine in.  There's about 12 seats inside, where you can enjoy your food & drinks.  The ultra popular, Priest Burger,  is a combination of a cheeseburger and The Option: a custom blend of cheesy goodness sandwiched between Two Roasted portabello mushrooms, breaded and deep fried.  This is Monica's favourite burger, hands down! It is perfection.   So tasty, flavourful, soft and cheesy.  Ultimate taste explosion in your mouth.  Chilli Cheese Fries -  their fries are yummy by themselves, but with chilli and cheese added to it, it just made it that much better!  We definitely suggest getting this side with your burger.  This burger joint a must-visit in Toronto for breakfast, lunch OR dinner... okay, breakfast m might be pushing it but hey, some people like that!  Go for the Priest Burger if you are here or, if you're feeling brave, try something from their Secret Menu, which includes crazy burger combinations."}
{"text":"Over-hyped! The beef itself is good but patties are thin. I could easily have 3 or 4 no prob. 2 wasn't enough. The bread is pathetic. Toppings mediocre. Prices unreasonable"}
{"text":"I still make the best burger period!  I live in the beach so not far .  crowded and noisy, you feel like your getting the shakedown just getting to the cash to order.  I couldn't take the close quarters so got to bump and grind with strangers again.   They had gluten free , bonus , I ordered for three and tried both.  The girl at the cash was pleasant and they got the order perfect but I was really disappointed with the end result....I don't know how the staff works in such a sweat box ...."}
{"text":"What I liked:   1. The burger was nice and fresh and on a soft bun. (Reminded me a lot of a Webers burger from up north)  A really great tasting burger.    What I didn't like:   1. The price. Two combos was $36.00. That's a burger, fries and a shake for two of us. This is fast food not fine dinning.   2. The fries are the worst I have ever had at a fast food place. They were tiny dry disgusting pieces that made me feel sick eating them. The whole bag was what you would expect to find at the end when you have like 4 fries left.  They honestly were awful. We both threw out well over half a bag each.      3. The speed of service. It took 15 mins to get our food. How does a burger take 15 mins to cook? I really don't know. They were not even busy, three other people were in the restaurant. The other customers waited longer then we did, they may still be there!!!!!  Over all great burger but will never go back to this place. Over priced, long wait times and fries that are beyond awful."}
{"text":"Burgers priest is listed as one of the best fast food burger chains in Toronto. I first saw them on tv from \"you gotta eat here\".   I have tried their famous priest burger. It is delicious ! It has a deep fried cheese stuffed portobello mushroom in the center of the burger. This mushroom makes a world of difference, making the burger extra cheesy and adds some crunch to the overall texture. I also tried the chili cheese fries. It's very very oily.. I understand that it is fries + cheese + chili, but there is just way too much oil in the dish for it to taste good.   Overall, the experience was good. I would only come back if I am really craving for a burger."}
{"text":"Went thursday july 28th around 7 pm and while the food is usually good. The service was super slow. They made tons of food but called no numbers. I think it all goes to take out and uber eats. Which means one is waiting awhile.for the burger. Also the cashier was so unfriendly... no smile did not want to be there at all.. made things awkward. Go there all the time but noticed that service keeps on getting worse"}
{"text":"Paid a visit to Burger's Priest, due to the buzz .  It was a good experience, and the burger was good but I have my favorites. Unfortunately the Priest couldn't sway my to give it a 5 out of 5.  The fries were not very good. I've had better at home :-(  To the next time..."}
{"text":"Very fresh tasting burger. Worth the wait? Mixed feelings. Very limited seating space.  There is a secret menu."}
{"text":"Okay.. what? They have a secret menu? A menu that I learned existed after ordering from their disappointingly sparse list on their wall?   I get that they're trying to be mysterious but I was enraged that I still spent over $15 for their mediocre-on-the-wall menu-for-commoners.  The burger patty was really juicy and tender but the greased up soggy bun ruined it for me.. The cookie was good though - I enjoyed it more than the burger. There wasn't much toppings to choose from or anything slightly \"gourmet\" about them.   Even when we found seating, it was super cramped and uncomfortable listening to the conversation beside us. How do people eat the burgers take-out? Wouldn't the burgers be super duper soggy...?  I may not have tried their \"secret\" menu, but sorry Burger Priest, I don't think you're worth the ridiculous line up for more greasy buns."}
{"text":"The burgers here are literally sent from heaven. Heard rave reviews of this place so my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try. I believe he got a Vatican City and I got the Option and wowza, the Option was delightful af. Two portobello mushrooms deep fried with a ton of cheesy goodness, I was beyond satisfied with it."}
{"text":"You may not believe in Jesus, but you'll believe in their burgers immediately. I ordered the Priest cheese burger. Loved everything about it, specially the cheese puff. It's a small restaurant, not really suitable for more than 2-4 people. They accept cash only."}
{"text":"What if God was one of us? Just a slob like one of us Just a stranger on the bus ...Seeking a decent burger in Toronto?  You're no angel, I'm no saint, if we were We wouldn't be in this place tonight ...consuming a days worth of glorious calories.  Well, I think I found my religion. Enlightenment, Completion, Absolution, Perfection that is grilled seasoned ground beef with a soft warm bun.  As expected, the line up was crazy long.   The sun may have risen and set a few times before we got to order.  I ordered one of their off-menu special burgers called \"the Vatican\". Two beef patties sandwiched between 2 buns that were made into grilled cheeses. ...add chilli fries... add a cherry cola... It was a burger miracle.  Thou shalt not sit because there are like 14 stools. Thou shalt pay in cash."}
{"text":"My husband and I order there at least once a week! The staff are all always so accommodating, efficient kind and friendly! Amazing food! Always fresh and very clean establishment!! Fav burgers in the city!"}
{"text":"Tasty burgers but the menu is quite limited. Also they taste great at the time but left my partner and I with a burger hangover. I would go back but would probably go for a single burger!"}
{"text":"I love this stuff.  After coming here for the first time a few years ago, I can't eat burgers again without comparing it to the Priest.  Based on the California style burger with entirely custom combos, you're not limited only to the typical condiments and toppings.  Here, you can also extend the customization to the number of beef patties, carbs (IE: Want your patties sandwiched between two grilled cheeses? Take your holy pilgrimage to The Vatican), and fancier/at extra cost additions like panko-crusted, fried jalapeños (here, dubbed Smoke), bacon, and grilled onions.  This is heavy, greasy stuff, but the GOOD type of greasy.   The previously secret menu is not so secret anymore, and the most popular combos are listed on menu now, on the wooden wall plaques typically featuring announcements or biblical quotes in a Catholic Church.   My go-to is The Priest with Smoke.  Something about those jalapeños burning through the layers of beef and deliciously cheesy fried portobello caps just feels so right.    Deep in my heart, I just *know* Burger's Priest must've been Hozier's muse.  You know, cause, \"Take Me to Church\"...?   Amen."}
{"text":"I love the burgers and the fries! Yum! My go to is the California Classic (they put the bun on the grill as well). My only beef with this place (no pun intended lol) is that they don't accept Debit or Credit cards. There's an ATM inside, but of course, it's not a major bank's ATM.  Other than that, it's a solid burger joint. Easily one of my favs."}
{"text":"Half of the fries are teeny tiny crumb pieces!  The burgers are quite good though. Definitely a cut above Wendy's."}
{"text":"I visited on a Thursday around noon, and was pleasantly surprised to find the place busy, but not so busy that I had to wait an inordinate amount of time to place my order, or to receive my food. I did have a bit of a pet peeve when it came to paying though.  I know this is by no means exclusive to this restaurant, but I don't like when no-service restaurants have a machine you can't tap at, simply to try and get you to tip them.  I mean, I'll always tip if I'm getting service, but here I'm lining up to order and pay, I've got to retrieve my food myself after someone yells my name, and then I'm expected to clean up after myself.  If anyone gets a tip it should be me! As far as the food went though, I have no real complaints.  The double cheeseburger was fresh and juicy, and dripping with cheese.  The fries tasted great; but like a lot of other people I'm continually surprised to find so many tiny bits.  But there were plenty of fries, and I didn't feel ripped off when I left a whole bunch of the tiny bits behind."}
{"text":"I think all the hype has set too high an expectation for this place. I've been to the Yonge and beach locations. And both times I left confused by all the 5 star reviews. It's good, but I wouldn't say it's the best.   It's a great burger, I don't mind spending $11+ tax if it's good. I got something off the normal menu, but some people have written it as a secret menu item. It was a double cheeseburger, with grilled cheese sandwiches as buns. The meat was good, and the grilled cheese buns were amazing. However, the food was VERY greasy, my wrapper stuck to the table. I was also disappointed by the use of processed cheese. With 3 to 4 slices of cheese in my burger, I would've liked something of better quality. That took down a star.  I got a combo, with fries and a drink. The fries were very good. I don't know how often I want to spend the extra money on fries but if you're hungry, I would recommend it.  The place is tiny, and I was glad not to wait in line for it. But usually when you go there's going to be lines. Passed by it for months before I went there, and I have never seen it (until today) without lines."}
{"text":"Got the order wrong 3 times. Burgers we're incredibly greasy and lacking flavour. Wait was really long. Not really sure what people are raving about.  Don't see myself coming back."}
{"text":"Great chicken burgers, not to mention they actually had grape crush as a pop option. Atmosphere was very laid back and casual feeling as well."}
{"text":"Burgers are ok, nothing special, prefer Stockyards' burgers. Dare I say, that Burger priest is comparable to Craft & Hero. Price is a lil for what it is.   Repeat: unlikely"}
{"text":"It was good and on a Monday night around 8, not super crowded. I think it might be a bit over-rated though. They don't have the selection of tasty condiments that you can get at other burger places. And yes, I know that's the point, but I don't care.   The \"secret menu\" concept is a weird idea. I feel sorry for the people who work there as they have to explain over and over again what the different menu options are, instead of them being written down.  Sorry I'm being a hater. It was an OK burger."}
{"text":"The Priest burger was so yummy. I like that you can choose what toppings you want, lettuce tomatoes ketchup mayo pickles onion etc. Similar to Shake Shack's in NYC but I might have to say priest burger was better.   Chili fries were totally unnecessary but you always need something else!   Small place with a few tables but turnover is quick."}
{"text":"Always great service and the beef is the best tasting ever! This location is small and used to be cash only, but now has debit."}
{"text":"My condo is a 20-minute walk from this location at Dufferin and Orfus Road. It used to be Demetre's for many years (relocated across the street) and then a halal brunch place that went belly up. A few improvements: this location is open Sundays and they have debit. It is located a short drive from Yorkdale mall and close to the Orfus Road outlets. I had a high priest (their much better version of a big mac) I added mustard, tomatoes and bacon. That was one big party in my mouth! Cheese, priest sauce, pickles lettuce, bacon, tomatoes, mustard...... oh my..... and the beef, Jerry! The beef! There are several delicious hamburgers to be had in Toronto. But none has better tasting beef than the Priest. Love at First Bite!  The burger was big and worth every penny of the $11.95 that I paid for it. With all the development coming to this area, it was only a matter of time that heavy hitters like The Burger's Priest came along. I feel another confession coming soon!"}
{"text":"Terrible I really truly do not understand how this is remotely close to best burger.   I had the bacon double cheeseburger. It was absolutely drenched in oil, tasted like the bun was dripping in butter, really oily fatty mince, plastic cheese. I am going to regret eating this later I am sure. My gfs California burger was even soaking wet bun. Revolting. Shake was good that's about it, but nothing special.  Oh and it's an absolute rip off."}
{"text":"I realized that I could actually go to TBP at their queen and spadina branch any time I wanted so I really had to give this place another chance. To avoid the long lines I came really early and got the magnum (because I like blue cheese on my burger). The fries were cooked almost identical to how big smoke does it so I guess that's a positive. Their fries were good. The burger... I still don't get it. How is this one of the best in Toronto?!   The long lines are partly caused by the length of time to prepare the sandwich. I was the 2nd customer there and it took quite a while for me order to go out. Other than that, burger-wise, nothing really stands out and because of this Holy Chuck Burger gets a better review (which i will be writing next.)"}
{"text":"I'm a bit disappointed, they refused to cook the meat the way i like i, they only do medium-well, i tried, not convinced...and was overcooked for me as planned. i ordered fries and what i got was more cubes of potatoes, they were good but nothing much longer than a finger nail.... so hard to dip in sauce also cash only"}
{"text":"Late night cravings somehow led to burger priest. I love their burgers and decided to switch it up and am ever so glad that I did, well kinda...  I ordered the stern fries and personally was not a fan. I wished they had onion rings but next time I will get just regular fries. Now onto the good stuff. I decided to try the Priest burger, basically a cheeseburger dresses as you please with \"the option\" on top. \"The Option\" is actually 2 portobello mushrooms, stuffed with cheese, breaded and deep fried. Trust me, this burger is all that and then some. Absolute burger bliss, I cannot wait to try it again!  I totally wanted to take a pic but it was that good, I ate it all at once (maybe next time lol)"}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger joint in Toronto!  Granted the fries are good, not great, and I'm not into milkshakes, but the specialty burgers are top notch and remind me of the long standing burger shacks I've tried in the US.  Except prices are much higher of course, but you'll get used to getting coins back on a 20 for a burger, fries and drink ;)  For burger lovers, I would recommend ordering something with more than one patty like the High Priest to get the full effect.  The fresh, juicy meat makes this burger and something larger takes it to another level of taste.  I love the traditional bun and the ingredients are always fresh and just right in terms of proportion.  For a chain, albeit a local one, BP rocks it every time."}
{"text":"Placed an order for takeout. Was told it was going to be 20 mins and it ended up taking 50. On top of that they messed up the order."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Toronto !! Staff are friendly & fast considering it's all scratch made. Check out the secret menu before going in"}
{"text":"I had the double cheeseburger and the fries. The burger was great, meat was of good quality, bun was too soft and by the time you finished burger, the bun disintegrated into a soggy mess. The fries were outstanding and you get a generous portion. You didn't even need ketchup, nice and crispy and a little on the salty side but I would come back just for the fries alone that's how great they were."}
{"text":"I would love to give five stars but there is one draw back and, as far as I can tell, that is it.  Excellent burgers, great fries, clean, and friendly helpful staff.  So what is wrong you say?  A design flaw so common in newer eateries.  The absence of soft surfaces to absorb sound.  Between the screaming child and the group of 12 that think they have to yell at each other, the noise level was bordering on dangerous.  Alas to cool to use the patio but it will be a consideration as we do want to come back again and again.  Not had such a good burger since the days of Legendary Toby's Good-eats. 5 yums for the food. So if you going during the lunch rush, bring ear plugs, cause the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Been to the other locations and this was nice because it has a large amount of seating both inside and out. The burger was good, we had the Priest. The fries had way too much salt on them, each one looked sparkley. The lineup went quick. Found it weird that all orders come in take out only, if it was for here orders there would be less waste of packaging as I felt guilty with all the waste. Will give it another shot as the fries are usually good at other locations, someone just went a bit crazy with the shaker."}
{"text":"Oh man was it crowded!!! Packed! Sunday evening, wanting so badly the Strawberry Milkshake, Chili Fries and Priest Burger, had to wait a good 30 minutes, while standing, but SO WORTH IT.  The Strawberry milkshake is made of nothing but milk and strawberry icecream, and it was so yummy. Chili Fries were to die for, deliciously cheesy, and full of flavour. The priest burger was the ultimate. deep fried portabello mushroom stuffed with cheese, delicious fresh patty, and crisp toppings...divine :)  Love the staff. Love the food!!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible... I can't understand how this place is popular .. it's crowded, overpriced and come on, these are fried burgers.  The Burger Cellar down the street is a zillion times better."}
{"text":"Wow!! Delicious! I couldn't finish the entire thing but I'm sure the leftovers will taste equally as good! Ha! Seriously hands down best burger I've had in a long time!! And thanks to the gal who told me about Webster falls!!"}
{"text":"Came here  2 time recently. Had the tower of Babel. With the 2 grilled cheeses, and the cheese thing in the middle. I really liked it, maybe a little too cheesy. but still good. Some people say that it looks disgusting but, I anit posting this for those people. If you like to try new things, try this burger or a simple cheese burger. The fries were a little over cooked, but still OK.   Seating is limited, and packed so I went to a park near by and ate dinner as the sun was setting, it was a nice night."}
{"text":"Burger's Priest is my favourite burger joint in Toronto. I absolutely love the deep-fried breaded portobello mushrooms + cheese, or as they refer to it: The \"Option.\" My go-to burger there is The Priest, which is a cheeseburger + the \"Option.\" I've also tried just the \"Option\" as well as the Religious Hyprocrite (the \"Option\" + bacon). Both were delicious, but I missed the beef patty.   Some of the burgers from the \"Secret Menu\" (which is not so secret anymore as it's posted on their website now) are pretty costly. But then again, some of them are a behemoth of a burger and are more novelty items than anything, so maybe that justifies the price.   Be warned, there's not much seating inside. Your best bet is to grab your food, and go find a bench nearby to eat. And I wasn't a huge fan of the fries, but if you're like me, you go there for the burgers so that's really not a problem.  So, if you're in the mood for burgers, I'd give this place a try. And if you're feeling adventurous and hungry and aren't at risk for a heart attack, you could even try The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (2 options, 2 beef patties, and 2 grilled cheese sandwiches instead of buns)."}
{"text":"Expensive. I paid $17 for a burger that tasted like a failed Big Mac, a bag of fries with not a single fry longer than an inch and a can of pop. I wanted a milkshake but once I saw how small they were for the extra $5 I decided against that.   It felt like a good effort at being a classic burger joint but just didn't deliver."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place forever and finally I did today. I dragged a friend with me to indulge in beefy goodness with cheese!  From all the Yelp reviews I had expected it to be a lot busier with no seating but on a tuesday afternoon, it wasn't bad. We didn't wait more than 10 minutes to get our burgers and fries.  I ordered the Vatican City and was not disappointed. I thought it would slide around a lot more but with a bit of manoeuvring, I was able to  fully consume my burger and fries.   I will be back to try the High Priest next time!"}
{"text":"The best burger I've ever had!  I tried and failed twice to have the Pope burger. The first time, it was closed. The second time they closed early because they ran out of burgers. By the third, it was all worth it!  I had the works of toppings with cheddar cheese (cheese ended melted just right). The burger was especially cooked the way it should. The patty was seasoned well. If you don't like grease, I suggest staying away from the pope burger because there is a deep fried Portobello mushroom in the middle. The burger was bigger than my hand and I had to use lots of tissue because the burger and grease was all over my face. I wrapping paper for the burger was all greased up and drizzling down my hand as I was eating it.  I don't know how, but we ordered chill fries and it was good.  The only downsize is there is not a lot of seating. We had to eat it on the street because we had a group of 6 people. Luckily, there were benches every intersection."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch at 3pm with my brother after wanting to try this place foreveeeer. Last time I was in Toronto, I came by on a Sunday only to find it closed! I was determined to try this place on my next trip back to Toronto, so we picked a random weekday during a Vancouver lunch hour to ensure my success.   I researched the burger options online prior, and already knew my selection by the time I stepped foot into their door. The place is small, it seats less than 20, but the floor is open so there's lots of standing room while you wait for your food. They've also got some outside seating if you want that option as well.  The menu is a bit cryptic. The option I wanted wasn't written anywhere in the store, so I had to ask them about it. Apparently it's on a secret menu (?) that is only talked about but not written anywhere. Secretive! I like it, felt like I was cool or something.   Anyways, I ordered the Tower of Babel. Do you know what it is? If not, let me tell you. Replace buns with grilled cheese sandwiches. Add an extra beef patty, and then add the famous deep-fried stuffed portabello thing in the middle. The burger is MASSIVE (as big as my milkshake), and took me literally 3 days to finish. That's right, I ate that thing Homer Simpson style.   The food is good, the shakes are alright, but that delicious portabello patty will most likely make me come back for me. It was definitely pricy ($20 for my burger) and probably ranks REALLY low if not in the negatives on the health factor, but if you're looking to indulge in a fancy burger, here's where you get off the bus."}
{"text":"Once in a while, I would crave for a double cheeseburger from Burger Priest. The meat they use is so fresh and delicious...this stuff gets addictive.  I've had the burgers from the famous In-n-Out chain in Los Angeles, and this place really does compare..perhaps even more fulfulling....  Their meat.......is so delicious...i've also had the one with the fried mushroom in the explosion of cheese...that was good too. Jalapeno poppers..also amazing.  I always get excited for my next trip for a burger here!!"}
{"text":"If I could have a go-to Cheat Day place... This would be it. Oh my goodness, The Priest, you have enabled me to sin via gluttony. It is great here. They make their burgers mighty fresh and they are super juicy. Not to mention the deep fried portobello mushroom was delicious.   If you come here, definitely get   BUTTERED BUNS.   It is so fattening and nice, an extra $0.50 I believe but... it is so worth it.   If you're not down to have grease, why the heck are you going to a burger joint anyways? Go wild and have some fun in life!"}
{"text":"Although a small place to visit, there is seating for a dozen folks to chow down on your meal.  I had the blue cheeseburger, flavour of the cheese was a nice touch to the texture of the burger.  i would say the burger could do with some seasoning, bland on it's own unless you ass on the condiments.  it's nice to have a fresh burger made that day, but i noticed they cook it right on a flat top and not a grill, so it sits in its fat to cook and then scooped up onto the bun with all the fat, making the bun soggy.  2 adults, 1 kid, 3 burgers, 1 fries and 2 waters runs you about $30, pricey for what you  get.  if you are in the yonge and bloor area, try Gourmet Burger Co., amazing burgers, fries included in price, lots of toppings and flavours on the board.  I have yet to try burger cellar a few doors down..."}
{"text":"Zagat put the Burger's Priest on the top three Toronto food joints, but-----I was not blown away. I waited, and waited, chewing and savoring every bite of my lukewarm burger. This classic Armenian joint, I mean,  American burger joint, is in fact tiny and a definite grab-and-go kind of place. The wait time is not what bothered me actually. Thankfully, I decided to come on a Wednesday night, and even had the chance to sneak in inside and not wait in the cold.   While I could hear people behind me chattering and hyping up the \"secret menu,\" I was greeted by Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian upfront. Leopard wedges are not appropriate work attire, however, very cute. If you don't' like showering twice a day, this place is not for you.   After getting our greasy bundle of joy, we ran back to our car which was literally four steps away. The fries were definitely a good portion. More than a good portion. I actually really enjoyed these fries, they were not soggy but crunchy.  The burger on the other hand--lukewarm. I will agree that the quality of the meat is there. This is not your ordinary McDonald's pattie, but it did not transport me to nirvana. It was a good burger, but not a MIND BLOWING burger. It is not a gourmet burger. I don't get the hype.   Now, if this place served lavash bread too, it'd consider coming back."}
{"text":"The burgers are fresh and tasty and that's why people come here!   There's usually not enough space to sit down, and I can head over across the street to get fries from McDs (I'm not a fan of Priest's fries).   Try to go off hours (closed on sunday though) to avoid the rush.  Don't go too late though because they do sometimes run out of beef."}
{"text":"The french fries were excellent, the burger was good but very small, the place was extremely scruffy and crowded. Would you pay over $17  for two straightforward burgers and fries which you had to eat standing up ?"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I love a good burger. The ingredients were delicious. I ordered from The Pope from the secret menu on a recommendation. Just delicious! Everything looked great but definitely check out the secret menu. The location is small so be prepared for the lack of seating if you plan to dine in. I almost gave them one less star bc of the small number of tables but I actually like the small burger joint feel."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at my last visit here just last week. I've been to this location before, as well as another - and with those visits, and as many others have said: good quality burgers, but smaller than expected.  I ordered a double patty burger on this visit in anticipation of the smaller portion. However, the patties each had substantially more meat than any of my other visits previously. Not that I didn't enjoy the two patties, but two didn't prove to be necessary. I'm not sure if it means the chain is going in another direction, or the staff on this day were simply feeling more generous, but it was to my benefit regardless.  All other components of the burger and the fresh-cut fries were great. No complains and I have to mention as well how super-friendly the staff were on this visit (about 11:15am Jan 27, 18). I can only hope the priest heard the prayers of the people for more meat portion and relayed those petitions 'upstairs', and this is what can be expected moving forward."}
{"text":"The burgers are fresh. Very tasty. The fries are ok. The shakes are pretty good. Overall one of the best burger joints in Toronto."}
{"text":"The best burger I have ever had It is comparable to shake shack  Long lines and little place to eat so get there early."}
{"text":"Went in expecting a great burger that would hit the spot. First time Yelp let me down. Left hungry. Only in Toronto would a place like Burger's Priest be rated this high. Faux foody joint.  Burger was tasty but small. Same size as a McDonald's cheeseburger. Small patty (about the size of a gourmet Italian meatball when raw), small bun, and to add insult to injury, they only take cash, BUT offer an ATM with a surcharge of $2.50. Ordered the Magnum and the Fiery Furnace. Overrated. Actually stopped by McDonald's on the way home to get another burger, and honestly, didn't find it all that much different."}
{"text":"Follow on facebook...ultimate burger...i buy everything smoked...portabello mushroom is a must with your burger."}
{"text":"I remember a long time ago i took a lengthy drive all the way down to the beaches; as I heard thru the grapevines of the foodie world of a burger that comes with great powers. It has the power to transform an average Joe who is content with his regular dosage of big mac and whoppers to mutate into a portebello munching , sweet soft bun gripping, ground beef dripping connosuir of one of the United States of America's greatest inventions - THE BURGER!!  I lie to you not- that day changed the definition of the word for me; however the trip to the beaches was too much and only on certain rare occasions could I re-charge this power granted to me. Till, the yonge- lawrence location opened up . Hail - Wind - Snow could not stop me from standing in line of a tightly packed dive-in ready to spend $15 on a burger that I would most likely have to eat in the car.   Now many years later- A new location has opened in my very own backyard. Very close to Yorkdale- Much bigger location- Patio seating and lots of indoor space. You would think that with everything I mentioned that this location would be much easier access. NOPE! line up was still out the door. Seating was packed. Made me actually feel sorry for the pizza nova next door- which was completely empty.  For those of you who don't know what the priest has to offer- MY bad! you should try it. Surprisingly- this location was open on a Sunday as well.   So Good!"}
{"text":"Best Burger, I EVER had. I have gone far to coin the term, that they are 'sinfully good'.  My buddy like to say, 'their meat is honest'."}
{"text":"WHOA! I've had luke warm feelings toward the Burger's Priest upon visiting their other locations. But this place has changed my mind!   All the critiques I had for other locations have been addressed here!  Crispy bacon! Significant toppings! Improved fries!  Other noteworthy things: meat is nicely browned on the outside, fries are nicely browned too! cookies! ice cream sandwiches!  Not so noteworthy: significant wait time, burger's aren't as big as other places, but I guess it's quality over quantity, small milkshakes.  This is my favorite Burger's Priest and it has delivered nearly perfect burger's every time."}
{"text":"The food is so great. Esp when the bun is grilled on butter.. I wish there were seats though"}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger  I've had in the longest time...unlike other burger joints, you see how fresh the beef is while being cooked. I've been coming here for about 4 years and loving it. The price is cheep for the value and quality you get. You should really try it if you haven't already."}
{"text":"I've had Burger's Priest bookmarked forever, so glad we finally got to check it out.  Found street parking. It isn't very big in here, there is some seating inside. Restrooms are in the back. In addition to their regular menu, they also have a secret menu (http://www.theburgerspriest.com/secret-menu/). Click on the link, I guess it's not much of a secret anymore. Employees are friendly and quick. Once you place your order, they call your name and you can pick up your food towards the back of the restaurant. Condiments, plastic silverware, napkins, and straws are within reach.   We tried the Strawberry Shake, Fries, The Priest Burger, and The Vatican City Burger. Their shake was creamy and flavorful, went well with the burgers and fries. Their fries were seasoned well and had a nice consistency. We enjoyed our burgers. The Vatican City is two grilled cheese sandwiches as the buns with a meat patty in between. Super cheesy and definitely not something one should eat on a regular basis, lol. I really enjoyed The Priest Burger. It's a cheeseburger with two roasted protobello mushroom caps that is panko crusted and stuffed with cheese. This burger reminded me of Shake Shacks Shack Stack burger. The buns were well made and held everything together. The meat patties were juicy but I didn't find them as flavorful as some of the other burger joints I've visited. I do appreciate the different kinds of burgers offered.   Overall, we enjoyed our burgers and glad we got a chance to visit!"}
{"text":"$18 for a veggie burger, fries and chocolate shake. Burger - super small but good taste, fries - normal portion and decent taste, shake - very small cup not even filled to top - tasted like chocolate milk. Overall very poor value. Would not return."}
{"text":"Omg. If u crave for burger this place is a heaven!!!  Burgers a little expensive but def worth for what you get. My favourite is their priest burger with everything in it. And of course a chocolate milk shake on the side is def a must !!!!!"}
{"text":"First timer here, the burgers are smaller than I expected and more expensive than I expected. First off, the beef patties are excellent. They're flattened thin and they have a nice crust on them. The deep fried portobello mushroom stuffed with cheese is an excellent addition to any burger, but it comes at a price. It cost me $6.50 to add it to the California Classic. Should've just gotten the Priest and it would've been more worth it. The special sauce tastes like Big Mac sauce so wasn't THAT special.   All in all, it's worth a try once, but I'd recommend the Priest burger for it's the best value.  The fries are great here too as they're super crispy."}
{"text":"These guys revolutionized the burger in Toronto and made it cool through secret menus.  They're no longer the best, but they deserve the credit for the options available today."}
{"text":"Damn good burgers cooked properly. If you are looking for a wide selection on the menu you'll be disappointed. What they do is done well. Fries are average however. There is a distinct lack of seating in the place so you might want to go at non peak times. I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"One of my favourites, atmosphere is casual, great food, happy and easy going staff, never had a problem so far when going for a quick bite with friends, or a date . Always something to talk about and people watch. Never been disappointed . So far so great!"}
{"text":"We tried this place out.  The daughter ordered the chicken bacon ranch sandwich, I got the double cheese burger and the wife fries and a single burger.    My burger was done to perfection and worth every bite.  My wife though her burger was greasy but loved the fries.    The daughter loved the chicken bacon ranch with root beer float.   My spouse had a bite of the daughter's sandwich and declared that would also be her order the next time."}
{"text":"This place really is the best. Best burger out there, melts in your mouth. I only ever get the single cheeseburger Jarze spell? style with nothing on it. Burger perfection...good meat..cheese..fried onions...unnoticeable bun...wash it down with grape crush...I'm very happy at this point."}
{"text":"After a day of shopping, we ending up on Orfus Road at Party City to get Birthday balloons - we needed lunch so we pulled in to Burger Priest and  both of us ordered The Token (buffalo chicken sandwich with hot sauce and blue cheese and lettuce & tomato) and a nice cold Shocked Top Beer for me a Rolling Rock Beer for Lilliane...... on such a hot day that's nice and cold !!! I also ordered  some fries with a side of blue cheese  - was suppose to be a no carbs day but obviously pulling here made that impossible !!!!   Found seats quickly and the nice air conditioning was great.  But the place is too loud with the kitchen noise, everybody talking and the crappie music it made it hard to think not to mention  trying to have a conversation.   Opened up the Styrofoam container after about a 10 minutes wait and saw a baby burger bun (like slider size) with a tiny peice of chicken  on it - the tomato slice  was larger than the chicken.....  tasted ok but about 5 bites later it was gone.....the french fries were terrible (cold and flavorless).   All-in-all - not worth a repeat visit - out of 10 on the burger place scale - I rank this a 4. Sorry - had  a higher expectation. If I do end up here again I will try a beef burger I guess if i have to."}
{"text":"We drove 30 km to find out they are closed on Sundays! Very stupid. Businesses in Toronto and on Yonge street should never close, very inconvenient and ruined our plans. Probably not going to try Burger Priest again."}
{"text":"Deeelicious BP. Deliciouus. First time at this location, very conveniently located near Yorkdale, for your post-shopping meal. Initially wanted to try out Katzs Deli beside them but since they were closed for the day, we came to the reliable but expensive Burgers Priest.  Got the Pope burger from their secret menu which was basically a double patty cheeseburger with an option patty added in between the two beef patties. Delicious. Also I always get the chili cheese fries although next time I may opt for their secret menu fried onion secret sauce fries. Cheese could be melted better on the fries but they do give an okay amount of beef chili and cheese for the expensive price tag! Also pop cans could definitely be cheaper.  Sometimes their pricing doesnt make sense. If I chose the Armageddon burger which comes with one more option patty than the Pope burger, it is $24 whereas the Pope is $16 (both dont include fries nor drink). For the difference of $8 for this one additional patty, I could buy an Option burger for the same price which would come with a bun and cheese and all the fixings..."}
{"text":"Obviously this place has been reviewed a ton. Yes you will get an amazing burger here. Yes its really fresh, yes they have great fries, and ingredients. All of this is true and I highly recommend the food.  BUT, there are a couple reasons I'm only giving this place 4 stars out of 5. PRICE and PORTION. For anything other than a standard burger you're going to pay quite a bit. For the Blue Magnum burger, a side of fries, and a can of coke my bill comes to OVER $20 with tax. Sure its a great burger, but a decent burger and fries doesn't even cost that much at a nicer sit down place like Moxie's or even the Keg (if you can get a burger there). And to be fair, its not exactly a big burger. Definitely on the smaller side compared to a lot of other places. More then enough food but I felt a little bad after spending that much money on that little amount of food. For a casual grab and go lunch or dinner, its pretty pricey.  All in all, this is one of the best burger places around. Great flavor, great freshness, and just what you're looking for in a burger and fries.  If it wasn't so expensive, and they upped the portion at tad, it would deserve 5 stars.  Also this particular location is very small with very little seating. I ate here for lunch one day and it was should to shoulder standing room only. Definitely take your food to go during peak hours.   ALSO PLEASE NOTE THIS PLACE IS CASH ONLY. No credit or debit. They have an ATM but no one likes paying the $3-$4 fee to withdraw. Also parking is a nightmare here. You have to drive all over the back streets behind the restaurant. I had to park about 7-8min walk away to find a spot."}
{"text":"I didn't like the place. It is too bright, without charisma, music, or ambiance.   Although we ordered the burger to go the waiting time felted too long; I could see the depression face in the attendance, along with the noise crickets make in awkward situations.  I ordered a burger that was supposed to be spicy but it wasn't. The patty lacked flavor, seasoning and effort. It made me remember fast food burgers with nostalgia.  I counted 4 beans on the chili fries and way too much unflavored crumbs of meat. The fries looked disgustingly greasy, and nothing was compensated by an acceptable taste."}
{"text":"This place is the best burger store I've been to in Toronto. The hamburger is made out of fresh meat which I can taste the difference. The restaurant itself is small so it's difficult to dine-in but I take-out the meal every time I visit. Make sure to try out their secret menu (search up google for more info)."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! The meat blend is ground slightly coarse which is great but a tad on the dry side.   There is not much I can add on to the other reviews really as all that's been said is fairly accurate. I do find that despite all the cheese and fried stuff that goes in to the burgers surprisingly it wasn't as greasy as I thought it would be. I'd skip the fries though as It takes away from the awesome flavor of the burger and it's really not that tasty.  Cash only as it's been stated before so bring a couple of green ones as you'll probably need it for the second burger!"}
{"text":"First off, a few things I wish I'd known before going: none of the secret menu is posted in the restaurant (sounds obvious, but it's up on their website - albeit without clear descriptions of what anything is), they accept debit, and they have an ATM. (Didn't use the ATM so can't speak to how much that costs.)  Aside from that, this was a pretty clear-cut double-occasion visit - my first and my last. I knew from their website that their menu is basically indecipherable without rigorous analysis and possibly a pen and paper, because they don't tell you clearly what anything is unless it's an item appears for the first time on the menu. This sounds like it wouldn't be a problem, but it IS a problem here because they seriously serve like 5 base sandwiches and have 30 items that are just combinations of those sandwiches, sometimes with specific toppings.  It's a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny place. Four \"tiny\"s because that's about how many seats they have. The food came out pretty quickly. The cashier was completely neutral - a completely disinterested blank face who took money in exchange for food and yelled out orders to the back during our transaction. I can't complain, but the tinytiny space + nigh-incomprehensible menu + blase cashier meant that I was just really flustered trying to order three sandwiches. So flustered that I just went on autopilot, into \"at a restaurant\" mode, and left a 10% tip on a take-out order without thinking. I hate myself sometimes. The cashier did not deserve any tip at all in this case.  Three sandwiches (2 of which were combos with fries and shakes) added up to about $45-50 with tax but before tip, which is really pretty bad. The fries were enh - probably on par with Burger King, honestly. They weren't crispy or well-seasoned and just tasted boring. Like a pure essence of slightly soggy, aggressively inoffensive potato. Not good, not bad, absolutely not memorable.  I had The Option (fried portobello mushroom stuffed with cheese) with sauteed onions (lol premium topping) and some light condiments (I think ketchup and mustard? Basically forgot as soon as I paid and didn't taste either in the finished sandwich). The \"patty\" was super greasy, drippy, and not meaty. I love mushrooms and this was a disservice to that fungus. The cheese almost tasted like barbecue sauce, for some reason. Gross. Nasty. Weak breading that smelled funny - offered the last bit to one of my dining companions and they asked if it was chicken. The onions were SO OVERPOWERING THE O N L Y TH I N G you will taste. They weren't bad-tasting (really mustardy) but OH MY GOD HOW DO YOU EVEN DO THAT WITH THESE INGREDIENTS. YOU HAVE FLAVORFUL INGREDIENTS AND ALL I TASTE IS ONION.  The shake (I had coffee) initially caused me to recoil and exclaim \"What the hell is this?!\". This is because, I realized, it tasted overwhelmingly of coffee liqueur. They didn't use coffee ice cream, but vanilla ice cream blended with coffee syrup. Not what I was expecting, bitey taste, did not like. The vanilla ice cream would have been good by itself, probably.  Everything was really greasy. I didn't get to try the two beef burgers that were ordered but mine was globby as hell (especially with the cheese) and I had to wash my hands after handing them to my dining companions.  Yeah, so not a fan.  P.S.: Interested to see that the chain appeared on \"You Gotta Eat Here\" because it embodies a lot of the worst tendencies of the show. Greasy and heavy (and I have a lot of tolerance for this, but it didn't taste good and it _felt_ greasy), emphasis on ~*unique*~ hipster stuff (they have a sandwich called the Religious Hypocrite which is an Option with bacon, lol get it, because the Option is vegetarian but the bacon ... isn't ... guys I swear it's funny) and ~*special*~ combinations and style over - well, anything really."}
{"text":"This is my fav burger joint. My fav burgers is the high priest and the pope. The option (cheese filled portabello mushrooms, bread crusted and deep fried) really adds to the juicy-ness and cheesy-ness of the burger. they need more burger topping options! but it's still a good burger.   However their fries are really a fail. that's why they lose a star. Also this place is small and it's really hard to find parking, there is ALWAYS a line up, and most of the time you can not find a seat. It really should not get 4 stars because of all these deductions, but the burger is sooooo good.  cash only still?"}
{"text":"So I definitely got excited when @ketointhesix mentioned the keto bun offered at BP.... I had to try it!   So it was surprisingly quick with getting in and out for a Saturday afternoon. Price was a on par with most niche/special fast food places. Food was nice and hot, fresh tasting and well put together.   Ok on to it: the bun. Most low carb/keto folks know that we either gotta no-bun it, lettuce wrap it or have something kinda...gross.  This was....something new! Fluffy, light and felt like a real deal bun!   I'm not only impressed with the fact they put this out, but took the time to perfect the recipe. I definitely am a fan! This is my first BP experience and it won't be the last!!!"}
{"text":"A pal and I came here on Friday for lunch. We had heard about the waiting times so we decided to meet after the lunch hour rush. At 1:30, the line was still quite long (don't people eat lunch at noon these days?)  I had the High Priest Combo. For $14, it's not cheap. As mentioned by others, the High Priest is like a Big Mac, but ... BETTER. The burger just melts in your mouth. The fries are fried just right.  There's no parking lot, but heaps of (free) street parking around the vicinity.  I can't eat here on a regular basis or else I'd be fatter and poorer than I am, but don't mind coming here as a treat once in a while.  Yay, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"We actually went on the opening day around 7:30 PM. I thought there would be a long line-up but to my surprise it wasn't busy at all. I ordered what I usually order at Burger Priest which is a single cheeseburger and I was very impressed by the consistency of the burger. The staff is well-trained and knowledgeable for a new location.  Today is our second visit to this location and this time I tried the Peter's Denial burger. The burger is good. It is worth trying. It has a big piece of chicken, cooked the way I like it. It is a must-try, price is same as a single cheeseburger."}
{"text":"The food is good but $10 for a burger and fries and drink extra!?!   This place is way too overpriced and pretentious. I think the better choice is Harvey's"}
{"text":"Quite excited to try these burgers as I've heard good things about them and their menus look insane!   Cute decor and decent about of tables. The pick up counter is quite high in my opinion; you can't see the people behind.  I got Peter's Denial (Southern fried chicken, sweet corn, gravy), for about $7. We dined in, but some burgers were wrapped in paper, others in a bag and mine was in a box-- was a little confused about the presentation consistency.  The flavour was good, crispy and very juicy chicken, but I was so disappointed in the size of the burger-- it's TINY. I was even more disappointed in the bun.... it was a standard regular bun, nothing special about it,  I thought they made their own buns for a burger joint. The buns aren't toasted and my friends' buns were cold.  I'm being really generous in giving this place a 3/5. The only thing saving this place from being a 2 is its flavour. I'm iffy on coming back; maybe I would at a different location, but not until they up their game."}
{"text":"Slowest service. Took about 15 minutes for our order. Ok burger. Not worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"By far, the best burger I've ever had, it just melts in your mouth. The 'high priest' is huge and you definitely can't go wrong with it. If you haven't been there, do yourself a favour and drop by. But go early, as I've seen they run out of hamburgers twice (around 9pm, on weekends). The chilli cheese fries are also a great call."}
{"text":"I really like the double cheeseburger. Yummy drippy greasy goodness. Check out the photos. They are not staged. The burgers are consistent to their brethren at other locations. We only need one fries for two people. Plus drinks and we are good to go.   What sets this location above the other one on Yonge, in the Beaches and downtown is that you can always sit down. I have yet to visit this location and not find at least one table for two available. The same seems to hold for the parking."}
{"text":"Sorry in advance as I'm not sure why my pics always come out sideways, I pre-rotate-edit them before uploading though.   After a first foray at the original Queen St E, I was not overly impressed as I only tried a regular burger and maybe cause I chose to eat at the beaches and it was freezing/wet.   This time however, I ensured I knew everything on the secret menu and got myself a Vatican Jarge style. Was epic, I can tell they are using some kinda special type of cheddar and beef, I rank it up there with In & Out and Shake Shack.  The lady got The Priest and enjoyed it quite a bit, she had something similar at Shake Shack and liked this version a bit more cause it had cheese fried in.   Can't give a 5th star cause there's not comfortable seating, there is seating, just not comfortable as it gets pretty loud and the line literally will be leaning on your back.   My other gripe is, there are no prices for the secret menu, after getting 2 burgers and chili fries, my total came up to $32 after tax, this had me trying to guestimate the prices cause wow did I just spend $10+ per burger but after I got home to rip open the bag and try it out, I had forgotten all transgressions.  Another tip, after or before you're done \"shopping\" at Loblaws, there's some free parking there, as well as at \"McDonalds\" across the street."}
{"text":"Greasy, different cheese then the one at the Upper Beach area.  not sure why, it should be the same technically. Go to the one at the Upper Beach if you can, for some reason it's an entirely different and better burger with the same name."}
{"text":"WOW - that's all I can say. Many burger joints are hyped up, like Five Guys. Their burgers are truly average and not worth the hype at all. I compare all burgers to Red Robin in U.S. (best burgers in the world) and didn't expect much from Burger's Priest. I was wrong. I don't know how these guys prepare the meat, but my god it's juicy. It has the kind of fat mixed in only higher quality meat has. Yes, some people will not like it. Likely the same people that prefer McDonalds meat over The KEG. But those who appreciate high quality meat will LOVE these burgers. My only regret is waiting so long giving these guys a chance. Instantly addicted!"}
{"text":"I tried the Beach/Beaches location a while back but for living close to Yonge and 401, it's definitely a trek. When I found out they were opening a location on Yonge, I was excited... When I found out it would be north of Lawence, I was even more excited.  Since opening about a year ago, this place consistently has long line-ups and inside it's a bit larger than the Beach/Beaches location. It can feel small still as the lines do snake around inside the store and into the seating area, especially if it is cold outside.  The atmosphere is great but nothing fancy. It does however, nod to the \"religious\" theme for which the name suggests (and lives by).  I've yet to order from the secret menu although I know what's on it but I do find the burgers quite good. It is priced where the gourmet burgers are priced but are perhaps slightly smaller which is often why I go for a double or \"the option\" which is a panko breaded portbello mushroom and cheese.  The burger cooked on a flat-top and much of the juices stay within the patty during the cooking process. I prefer the cooking method over something cooked over a flame and where some juices can be lost in the process.  Since there are so many burger places to choose from so I don't know yet if this is my favourite but I would be comfortable in endorsing it as one to try... at least once."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Toronto, hands down! Try the priest for a deep fried ball of cheese added to your burger or Vatican City to replace the buns with grilled cheese sandwiches."}
{"text":"Just had a Blue Steel combo because I'm hungry, yet I'm so Canadian who appreciates smell of blue cheese. Yes, I totally understand the burger and fries will get me just right calories to move on. The taste and texture of the food is amazing however, my mind is saying otherwise when I look at that 1/3 full of tray after paying somewhere around $20. Should I blame the Liberal for getting lesser bag for a buck due to the increased living cost or the Burger Priest who could've be more thoughtful in package design by making the products look bigger and larger since it falls under \"premium\" category?"}
{"text":"Ordered the The Token - buffalo chicken, blue cheese, lettuce and tomato - with a Rolling Rock beer.  Was given my number and grabbed a seat.  My first observation was this place is busy...a real hive of activity and packed with people and actually quite loud.  We managed to find a seat by the window and even though the place was jammed, the air-conditioning kept us comfortable.  The wait for our food was not too long...less than 10 minutes.  When I opened up the Styrofoam container I was immediately struck by how TINY the burger actually was!  I just spent  $17 on a  burger and a beer - no fries! I'm calling wallet rape on  this one.  The burger was good...but just good...not amazing.  2 stars."}
{"text":"I came here on Saturday night at 7:00 and it was medium busy, only 2 people in front of us in line but a lot more waiting, 10 minutes later there was a line out the door! So be prepared to wait for your food.   I ordered the option, which is their veggie burger, if you're been to shake shack in NYC this is exactly the same burger. Mushrooms with cheese deep fried. I ordered it with lettuce and tomato (I am plain) and my partner ordered a burger with everything on it. We had separate orders and paid separately. When our orders came out, the toppings were switched! Mine with everything on it, and his with lettuce and tomato, nooooo. If you hate mustard you know how awful it is to get mustard on something that you did not want it on omgggg. Ok so we switched buns and it was ok except there was still some mustard on mine. It was weird because of how we even had separate orders! We were just lucky that we were together and could do the switch. We had already waited over 15 minutes for our food and there was a huge line so we didn't want to complain to the kitchen. Also my veggie burger could have been cooked longer, the cheese was not oozing out as it should have been, it was warm at best.   I still gave them a 3 because I know that this place obviously has the potential to be better, they just screwed up my order a little bit."}
{"text":"Just went here for lunch with my bae.  The cashier was very friendly and welcoming. I appreciated her letting us take a billion years to decide what to order.  I was being modest (had to return to work right after) so finally I decided on their cheeseburger and we split an order of fries. The bae selected the double cheeseburger with an added \"smoke\" topping (Panko crusted jalepenos).  The food came fairly quickly and our orders were correct. I really enjoyed my yummy cheeseburger. The bun was soft, beef patty was juicy and well seasoned, with just right amount of toppings. Really liked the fries as well, nice and hot and crunchy! Bae loved his burger and even gave me a bite of the fried jalapeños topping - yum!  I would come back again for sure on a day where I can rock some stretchy pants ;)"}
{"text":"Great juicy burgers, and delicious crispy/chewy fries. The staff are great. Very happy everytime. Not a shock to see them constantly busy."}
{"text":"Tiny place selling big flavor burgers. I opted for the high priest and it was delicious. Only downside is I am a Medium-Rare kind of gal and they only serve the burgers at one temp which is well done. Besides that, definitely a Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Good experience The beef patty is exceptional but the size makes you suffer. I could have eaten two burgers. The person who built my burger did as it should have been. It didn't fall apart while I ate it! (Can you tell I'm picky but only in that way lol) and the girl taking my order was really nice. I hadn't been to a Burger Priest yet so she did have a hand in what I ordered. I had gotten the Priest basic cheeseburger with your choice of toppings, fries gravy on the side and a soda float. Burger and fries were really good, price not so much for what you got in portion sizes. I would go back but I'll try the chicken burger they have with blue cheese. I'll skip the soda float. Overall I'd say try this location they were nice and fast!"}
{"text":"I visited on a Saturday at around noon there was one person in front of me and I waited for a total of 7 to 10 minutes for my food  I ordered the single fiery furnace which was not fiery at all LOL but the Patty itself was juicy tender and fresh the toppings were fresh as well however the crush Peppers that come with it were not spicy  I ordered a side of fries as well their fries portion is quite large the fries tasted very good I don't know if I got the bottom of the batch but they were cut quite small so I would have preferred to eat it with a fork but the fries itself tasted really good"}
{"text":"I love this place! You have to try it out when your near a branch of theirs. I personally think that their less greasy compared to the other burger joints I've eaten at and the vegetables are always so fresh looking.   Anyway you have to try it, and make sure to check out their secret menu (avail in website only) if your feeling adventurous."}
{"text":"Hubby and I are fans of Burger Priest because sometimes we like to indulge in a good burger, fries and a shake. Don't come here if you have health issues or are counting calories though; this is a place to have a major cheat meal. Maybe you'd feel better if you knew that their beef is free range, grass fed and ground in house daily.  OUR GO TOS: - FIERY FURNACE Bacon cheeseburger with crushed hot peppers with added \"smoke\" (breaded deep fried jalapeños). Not that spicy but flavorful. - THE PRIEST Cheeseburger with a portobello mushroom cap that's panko crusted, stuffed with cheese and deep fried.   Tried their Riggs and Murtaugh (vanilla ice cream with chocolate milk) shake which was thick and yummy!  Combos come with their fresh cut fries and pop (they have Dr Pepper, plus points for this)  When you venture further out of Downtown you gain elbow room and lines shorten. Staff are helpful and friendly. Located by the outlets on Orfus Road, it's a perfect place to grab a bite to eat after a round of shopping.  INTERESTING FACTS: The founder had aspirations of being a pastor but things didn't quite work out they way that he wanted. As far as the name of the restaurant \"the restaurant name is actually Protestant in inspiration, based on the idea that anyone, anywhere can bring the sacred into the mundane.\" - excerpt from website."}
{"text":"THE BEST burger I had so far.  I highly recommend hidden menu called The Pope. Service was meh but food totally make up for it. the place is quite small and smell like heavy greasy meat so if you care about your cloth, maybe bring your burger out side and enjoy it with nice breeze?!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and a hot griddle translate to a tasty burger, but not exactly manna from heaven. Had the buns been buttered and they used better cheese, I'd add another star.  If you pass it is worth a stop, but a drive across town is not called for."}
{"text":"Went to this Burger's Priest location (North of Yonge/Lawrence) this past week and tried the Vatican... not everyday you get to eat 2 grill cheesed sandwiches that act as a bun, and 2 burger patties in between... The burger was fantastic, but I'm going to ignore the calorie count on this one....  hahahah... LOL"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers here, I had the double cheeseburger and fries. As expected, after 5 minutes or so it came steaming hot and juicy, cheese and fat dripping out just like a burger should. Fries great too. Just like the Queen location it's small and not really designed for eat-in but there are stools and countertops if you wish to eat there.  At this location they offer shakes, of which I had the \"Riggs and Murtagh\" (chocolate and vanilla). Note the shakes (among other things) are on the \"secret\" menu which you have to go to their website to see, it's not posted on the wall in the place.  The food here is awesome, the only thing that keeps it from 5 star is the lack of seating.  Since I don't live in the neighbourhood, takeaway is not really an option, especially in winter.  Also note it's cash-only, so bring money, otherwise you'll have to use the ATM on site."}
{"text":"This is a no nonsense burger diner type venue. The burgers were awesome as well as the staff."}
{"text":"I would give it 5 stars, because I really do think BP \"Priest\" burger is one of my all time favorites, but it is SO incredibly salty, that I have been drinking water, beer, what have you, just to take the parch edge off, but nothing is working.  Other than that, this place is awesome.  I love it, love it, love it.  They only take cash, which is a bit of a drag, but there's an ATM in the restaurant and nearby banks.  I have learned my lesson to ALWAYS phone in an order first and just go up and pick it up.  My husband is not a fan of waiting (a la Stockyards) and so, this is the way we roll.  Next time, I'd like to try the High Priest, which is a take-off of the McD's Big Mac.  I heard it was amazeballs.  Still thirsty..."}
{"text":"The best burger chain around.  I've eaten at several of their stores. Always outstanding. There are many good local restaurants but the burger priest is hard to top."}
{"text":"I;ve been here twice so far and have had somewhat different experiences both times. The first time I went here I got the option burger which is a regular patty topped with their portabello caps. I didn't really enjoy it that much tbh. While I had no complaints with the patty or the mushroom, I felt liek they just didn't go together. Well the patty is a bit on the greasy side but I guess thats what gives it the flavour. The next time I ordered off the secret menu and got a high priest which was much much better. It was a bit cold by the time I got home but I still really enjoyed it. The location itself is really convinient for people who don't live downtown. It can get a bit crowded at times and seems to be really popular with the kids of the neighbourhood who popped in after school. The burger for $10 is a little pricey but then I guess you have to pay a little extra if you don't want to eat at the Mickeys across the street. As for the location I believe it just opened up about a month ago and looks brand new. I love the tiles on the ceiling and the grille in front of the prep counter. There's hebrew on the walls which also adds an interesting touch. There is paid parkign available right in front of the store or just off the street if you're cheap like me and don't want to pay to park. Overall I'd much rather have just a burger here then get a burger+fries+drink from McDonalds. I'm not one of those people that hates McDonalds, but for roughly the same money if you can get a burger that tastes a lot better, won't make you hate yourself 5 minutes after eating and is made with presumably fresher ingridients - why not?"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of mixed reviews about this chain, and I finally had a chance to visit last week for lunch. It was a beautiful, warm & sunny afternoon (crazy for late October!) so we ate our lunch on the patio. Even a persistent wasp couldn't ruin our day.   I chose the bacon cheeseburger and a side of fries for sharing. The fries were disappointing, because they were just tiny bits of potato - like a big pile of rejects from the bottom of the fry bag, or perhaps made from little nugget potatoes. They tasted fine, but I prefer my fries to be made from full-sized grown-up potatoes.   The burger was really delicious - no complaints there. Juicy, well-seasoned, full of flavour. Bacon was cooked properly and the toppings were fresh and the bun was just right. I thought it was worth what I paid, but next time I'll try the blue cheese burger. No fries, though.   I took off a star, because I tipped when I paid (prompted on the credit card machine), but then I was told they don't even bring your food out to you - they just call your number and you have to go get it - and you have to clear your own table when you're done. What am I tipping for? No service, no tip. Sorry."}
{"text":"Went here for the very first time just the other day, and I was pleasantly surprised. I went in thinking it was just going to be like any other burger, how could it stand out? But it really did stand out...The burger itself was cooked very well, and was so succulent and juicy at the same time (Don't usually get all that in a burger). I had the double cheeseburger, it was fabulous! Only thing I kind of regret is the fact that I didn't fill my gut with any more of they're delicious burgers...But in due time, that will change I assure you! Next on my hit list is there secret menu, some of those creations look insane, you must check this place out :)"}
{"text":"I awake in cold sweats some nights when dreaming of this fine establishment.  I hope, one day, that Burger's Priest and I could get married... maybe have our wedding in the distillery district.  And Burger's Priest could birth a few children on a daily basis.  The edible burger kind..  I'll probably get fat though.  It'd never work..."}
{"text":"I reviewed Burger's Priest back in 2012 but I feel the need to review it again and reinforce my original 5/5 rating. When I crave burgers (which is all the time) BP is always at the top of my list. The meat is just so rich and melt-in-your-mouth; the bun and toppings done just right. Seriously this is last-meal-on-Earth type of stuff. Truly a \"religious\" experience.  My old favourite was simply a double cheeseburger with everything on it, but I just found a new favourite: a single cheeseburger with everything on it, \"Vatican style\"--i.e. a cheeseburger with grilled cheese sandwiches in place of buns. Caloric intake be damned...that's one drool-worthy sangwich. I mean sure, it contains 4 slices of bread and overall 3 layers of cheese, but as it says in the Bible, \"Judge not lest ye be judged\" :)  (Note: this is not to be confused with the \"Vatican City burger\" which is a DOUBLE cheeseburger with grilled cheese buns, which I feel is just a tad too much for me.)  Random tip: skip the Coke and try a Cotts Black Cherry pop."}
{"text":"Had the double cheese burger with bacon and smoke (deep fried jalapeño's) it was very good. The melted cheese is awesome. Enjoy! if you go to mobile site they have a hidden menu."}
{"text":"I am from Houston. This place was delicious! Food was fresh! Flavor was on point. Meat was soft and juicy. I want to go back to eat before I leave for Houston! Would recommend."}
{"text":"Went last night. The visit to Burger's priest was long overdue. I was pretty excited to try it seeing as how I've been hearing about it for the last two years from friends.  The burger bun was really soggy, someone in a previous review mentioned this, if I had seen it prior to going, I would've brought extra napkins with me. The bun was SO soggy, it didn't serve it's purpose of holding the ingredients in. My hands were covered in grease by the time i was done and the taste didn't make up for the mess.   I ordered a California Burger, my friend ordered the Magnum - didn't see the need to order anything on the \"Secret Menu\". We were pretty disappointed. I'm not sure what the hype is about.  There's limited seating which means that people have to stand or take it to-go - this I find surprising because the body of the burger makes it very hard to eat on-the-go- or standing.  The patties are thin (forcing people to order doubles if they wanted a meal experience), they don't have any special taste or seasoning and regardless of which burger you order, you're going to get a soggy bun. I've had better burgers elsewhere and I'm almost sorry to say, but $8 for a burger from here isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Burger Priest was on my list of must tries before I headed back to NY.  The Cali Classic was amazing and the chilli cheese fries were delicious. The patties were super fresh. I can not wait to come back to Toronto for this. No more Zinburger or IN - N - Out for me."}
{"text":"We have visited this location multiple as this is the closest Burger's Priest for us.  We love the Bacon Double Cheeseburger & High Priest!! We like the Peter's Denial, but the burger is soggy!  Be prepared for long lines during rush hours on weekdays, and brunch-lunch hours on weekends. Seating is very limited."}
{"text":"So far I have had the priest and the grilled cheese bun, very tasty!  Down side is that it's a bit pricey in that the burgers are around $10 without drinks or fries."}
{"text":"I don't understand, I remember writing a review about this place. Anyway, it's so good I'm happy to do it again.  This is my favourite burger spot in the area! I'm a full believer that you aren't a true Torontonian unless you've had a burgers priest burger. I've been coming here for years and it was the first location to offer milk shakes. The first time I had one of the Jarge shakes, it was a religious experience! It was like drinking neopolitan ice cream and that was a completely new item for me.  I'm an Option lover. That first bite where you suddenly have this mouthful of melted cheese is so satisfying. I have never had a bad burger from any burgers priest.  The problem is, I'm now conflicted, as they now offer an incredible chicken burger. The owners clearly perfect a protein before putting it on the menu. This chicken and gravy burger is moist and evenly spiced. So now when I go I don't know which to order.  I've never been a fan of their fries but I can't identify why. Too greasy? Also, they aren't always on top of cleaning off tables in an efficient manner, which is kind of understandable considering the high turnover of patrons."}
{"text":"Amazing! Very busy location (like all Burger's Priests) but good food, lots of seating and friendly staff.  I do agree that the wait time from order to your burger being ready is slightly longer than other locations but quality is still very, very good.  Burgers were moist, fries were lightly salted and we all left very satisfied! Another great location that's worthy of a visit!  And I repeat, you aren't officially a Torontonian unless you've tried Burgers Priest!"}
{"text":"Holly expensive burger! My brother in law raves about this burger place.There's no where to sit and you come out smelling like meat. It was good, I'm no burger connoisseur and I thought it was ridiculously pricey, so overall just A-OK for me. But I also didn't get the \"Big Mac\" replica burger, which I was told it was excellent and supposedly well worth it."}
{"text":"The best burger I've had so far, you gonna eat here. Don't expect your burgers look like those photos posted on their website though, being tucked in a paper bag with fries and everything. Boy, but their burgers sure taste good. Make sure you check out their secret menu before you go, because you won't find it anywhere in the store."}
{"text":"Best.  Burger.  Ever.    And worth the wait.  Tip:  call ahead with your order and you can skip the line for a quick pick-up."}
{"text":"Honestly, if you're going to be famous for having the best burgers in town, don't cheap out on the bun! The buns play a critical role in making a good burger. The patty itself may be awesome but served with what seems like Dempsters bun that's room temperature and non toasted?! COME ON. I'm paying like $10 for this and cash only.  The chocolate cookie though is really good! But their ice cream sandwich had way too much ice cream. I can't bite into it without the entire ice cream spewing out and all I'm left with is the 2 cookie -_- how does one eat this properly? Maybe I'm doing something wrong."}
{"text":"I had the Mushroom Burger; it was very cheesy and breaded nicely. Only downfall was that it was very cold in temperature.  Restaurant is very clean and fast service; fries are fresh cut!"}
{"text":"Wow. I try my best to keep my ratings fair -- really really bad gets 1 and the Burger's Priest is my first *****. Right, the place is small BUT when you get your meal --- ahh just amazing. Great team, friendly, warm. Just love it. The Burger Cellar which lacks quality and service is going to really wish the Burger's Priest did not set up so close to their home. Excellent meal and great value for $$$. Love it. So deserving of my first 5 star rating. Yum and then some."}
{"text":"The burgers were nothing special and the prices seemed over price for adding in extras like elegant cheese .By the way the place does not serve relish. What burger place does not serve relish with their burgers? The portions are small. I had chilli fries with cheese and burger with jalapeño and mozerlla cheese, and milk shake. The who thing was 22.00 dollars. I gave it 2 and half stars. The review says 2 stars but I'll give the a break. There a lot of improvement needed.  Would I go back. Yea if I was really hungry."}
{"text":"Very simple: a truly fantastic burger.  Mine just melted in my mouth.  Perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked. Enough said!  I would skip \"the Option\". For me, this over powers the burger. I'm no expert, but it must add about 850,000 calories (deep fried mushrooms filled with cheese!). Tasty in its own right, but just not necessary in a burger!  Very expensive burgers, but worth trying.  Go on, you know you want to..."}
{"text":"OMG, un des meilleurs burgers. Commandez Le Vatican qui ne se trouve pas sur le menu. Un double burger entre deux grilled cheese. Une demie étoile en moins pour le prix, presque 40$ pour 2, et on parle de deux burgers, une frite, un soda et un milkshake. Par contre, rien à voir avec les burgers de grandes chaînes... et de moins grandes... Une demie étoile en moins pour le peu de place pour s'asseoir. Je dirais une dizaine de tabouret autour d'un comptoir. Employés très sympa. Try it if in TO!!!"}
{"text":"Came here to fill the belly as Hazels Diner did not do the job. Got the High priest burger $9.95 and a chili with fries $5.95. I see a whole lot of good reviews for this place so my expectations are super high. Not sure if I came at a bad time or maybe I had just ate a chili dog at Hazel's Diner but I found the beef patties in the burger to be thin and dry. The sauce was golden though (3/5 stars). Similarly with the chili fries I felt the sauce was a bit dry. I was expecting the chili to be a bit more saucy and liquidy but instead got dried chili beef chunks (3/5 stars)."}
{"text":"Meh. Fries are okay, burger tasty but greasy. Whole \"secret menu\" thing is pretentious."}
{"text":"If you're a burger fan - cmon down to Burger's Priest. Recommended to me by a colleague who is quite the burger connoisseur, I can say I'd gladly recommend a visit here to anybody looking to alleviate a burger craving. The menu on the wall is very straightforward with a short list of items to choose from. Suggestion: before you visit try to look for their secret menu (online only), and composed of a list of some ridiculous burger towers.  Don't expect the burgers to look like the pictures on the website but hey, it's a burger it's going to get messy. Plus it's all about how good it taste and taste it does! For a \"fast food\" burger it wasn't overly greasy which was a nice surprise and the meat patties where very tasty. Needless to say I'll be logging a couple extra km on my runs in the coming days - but all in all I leave with a full stomach and a happy customer.  Order of the night: - Four horseman of apocalypse from the secret menu (double cheeseburger with 2 deep fried cheese stuffed portobello mushrooms 2 patties with 2 grilled cheeses as patties). I'll admit that this was expensive for a burger even considering what you get in my opinion. I did it more for the experience but not sure I'd order it again. - Noah's Ark from the secret menu (veggie burger with cheese stuffed pepper and vegetarian chili and cheese) - chilie cheese fries - Vanilla Milkshake (really really good)  FYI - Cash only and you can order in advance for take out"}
{"text":"Ummm..hello amazing burgers.  I live in Los Angeles, and upon visiting Toronto, I tried this place out. Absolutely amazing. My friends and I each got something different from the menu and well..it was all delicious! I love their shakes too! The lineup is always long, and its always super busy, but good for them!!! It SHOULD be busy! Yumm!!! :D Can't wait to try it again on my next trip back!"}
{"text":"Went here on a holiday Monday so glad to see they didn't close like many other restaurants did....  Got a Vatican city burger (with only one meat patty) & added secret sauce. The grilled cheese buns were tasty! The burger itself was underwhelming...I was soooo disappointed, having read all the hype, heard positive word of mouth reviews & being in a line up. Didn't finish it all bc I was just not impressed. Thankfully it didn't go to waste bc DH .enjoyed his.   The space in the restaurant was enough for a take out joint. It did get a bit backed up while we waited but the turnover was pretty high. They also have good ventilation there so u don't come out smelling like fast food after waiting inside...lol.   The prices were a bit outrageous for the quality (I've definitely had better burgers!!) & the cash only policy is way outdated (not to mention dangerous for the employees)...I bet they make loads off of their in store ATM machine tho!  The cookies taste like chocolate chip from subway btw so they were yum:-) kept a star in the rating for that!!"}
{"text":"I don't know what the hype is all about. I got the cheeseburger (no combo). It's small and it's $6. The ingredients tasted fresh though. And the burger is tasty. But there's nothing \"wow\" about it. The toppings are all typical - lettuce, tomato, onions, mustard, ketchup, pickles. I was expecting other fancy stuff like guacamole, sauteed mushrooms or something.. I miss Hero burger now. This is a grab and go place. There's only about 12 bar stools here and the music is really loud so you probably won't be able to carry on a conversation in here."}
{"text":"The jury is still out, gotta check all the secret menu items before I can give this the coveted 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Cashier looked like she hated her job. Even if she does she should at lease pretend to like it. The food was very good which is why it deserved the 2 stars but they literally take 10 minutes to complete one order and if you're caught behind a family of 5 ordering, expect to wait 20-30min for your food. Drink selection is terrible but thats the companies fault. Could not understand why they have a huge tray for tips and a tipping option if you pay debit or credit.... YOU DO NOT DESERVE A TIP IF FOOD TAKES FOREVER TO ARRIVE AND CASHIER IS NOT FRIENDLY."}
{"text":"I've had so many people recommend burger priest to me. Burger priest was crushed beneath the enormous  burden of hype it was shouldering.  Failing to deliver in almost every aspect. Ordered a Red Sea burger. Cheese burger with chilli. It was like eating a pile of wet leaves freshly raked in the yard. The lettuce, the tomatoes, the meat, and the bun were all of the same consistency. Grey would be an accurate way to describe the taste.   Decor was of the cheap nature. Parking was good. Food was slow.   2/5 would not return. At least fries were crispy!"}
{"text":"In the past I have always been anti-priest.  Claims of, \"it's too much money!\" and, \"you don't even get full afterwards!\" used to be my rallying calls for going anywhere else.  What I'm now realizing is that I hated their set up of paying $16.00 and then having to sit on the cold concrete wall of KFC down on Queen East, or walking twenty minutes to the picnic bench down by the beach.  Apparently, if you can order, wait inside at a nice table, eat there, and then enjoy your experience, it's actually quite divine!  I had the double bacon cheese burger with fries and a drink.  This ran me around $16.50 (if you're going to priest, you might as well do it right.)  The burger was everything I wanted from it, and more.  Because I didn't really want much.  The fries were also pretty tasty.  If this meal was under ten bucks, it would be four stars for sure - but as it stands, you get good food; however, at that price you better.  Still, it wasn't terrible, and that was the biggest shock of all."}
{"text":"So everyone has a burger guy now-a-days and sooo many swear by either the Priest or the Chuck so we gave one a try today. We ordered a high priest and cheeseburger. They were way too greasy and the patty was nothing special (the secret menu was not appetizing to us). The best part of the Priest were the fries and the gluten-free bun, but that's not enough to make me come back. Again, this is a matter of preference, and for me the best burgers in the city (thus far) are South Street and Paradise Farms (Big Smoke comes in 3rd). The Priest is in purgatory with the 5 Guys. Unfortunately, the best burgers are in the far west: Gordon Ramsay's Burgr and In-N-Out. This is not a bad burger, but in my opinion it's not worthy of the hype it gets. Sadly, I was not converted. :("}
{"text":"Just like the other location, I can't say enough good things about them without sounding like a crazy person.  I love the simplicity of the burger.  It's not gourmet by any means, it's just excellent execution.  What I love most: is the meat blend.  I've been able to taste at least 2 different cuts of beef in the burger thus far.  (Brisket and sirloin)  And every time I go back I learn a little bit more.  Every once in a while I try the over-the-top burgers with the grill-cheese buns, but to be honest, the extra layers of cheese take away from the simple ooey-gooey goodness of the burger.  My favourite: double with bacon and all the toppings.   When I go though, I have to buy 2 burgers...  The first one disappears in seconds... and the second one doesn't last much longer than that either."}
{"text":"The burger is worth dying for! And the milkshake ! Too delicious tastes like Shake shack in New York ! Will come back soon!"}
{"text":"THE BEST of THE BEST!!!!!... All I can Say is WOW....  The best Burger I ever had.. if there is 10 Stars I would give it. I have tried most of the burgers they all awsome"}
{"text":"I hate buying burgers because I feel like I can make one just as good at home. But one thing is clear here, I can't make a burger like Burger's Priest.  I had to get The Priest which is The \"Option\" + Cheeseburger. The \"Option\" is this mushroom cheese melt that's been deep fried so when you bite into it, cheese oozes out. On top of that, I added mayo, tomato, lettuce and pickle just so I feel like I'm making my burger slightly healthier.  Was the burger overly salty? Yes but there's a cheese melt involved so how can it not be?! Was it overpriced? I paid over $10 for the burger so it wasn't a cheap burger at all. But I give them 4 stars because that's how much I enjoyed that burger.  I went on opening week so there was a crazy line up and the place is tiny so don't expect to dine at the restaurant. Next time I'll definitely try something off their secret menu. Good thing there isn't a Burger's Priest near me or else I'll be visiting them at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Cant remember how many times I've been here. It's been one too many. I always order the POPE despite I'm lactose intolerant. It's just so good. Started to order the double burger no cheese with the smoked Lettuce tomato onion and HP sauce. You have to have the High Priest sauce its just soooo much better with it.  Maybe because I've been there so many time already. the last three times i went i found the so so...... the beef is not as juice and flavorful. It's a little dry and tastes a little like frozen. I doubt they use frozen. their turn over is so high.   Try the Jagger style (mustard infused) patty if you just want something different."}
{"text":"These burgers just fall apart in your mouth! The patties are soft and succulent, full of juices! I have been to Burger's Priest twice now and both times, my boyfriend and I have not been disappointed!  The only complaint I have is the lack of seating! It might not be a good option if you're going with a large group, because there isn't a lot of dine-in space. It's perfect for a take-out order though! Lines are long at times, but go very quick!"}
{"text":"Giving 5 stars in the \"burger\" category is one of the most difficult things to do on yelp given the number of competitors, but i think the quality (though not the value) of BP merits the \"as good as it gets\" rating.   Yes, there is a secret menu, but you can find a picture of it in the yelp pictures, so don't stress. I went at an off-hour (3pm), which I'd recommend, especially if you need help navigating the menu and for help on the secret menu. I think you'd do fine with regular menu items too (since the burger i most enjoyed was a regular menu one).   I'd recommend the \"priest\" burger (cheeseburger with \"the option\"). I think if you had \"the option\" alone, it wouldn't be enough. But for almost double the price of a basic cheeseburger, the option is a very expensive \"topping\" to add.   I also tried the \"high priest\" - BP's take on the Big Mac. Very good, but very meaty (for some people that's not a bad thing, but i preferred \"the priest\" over this \"secret menu\" burger - i need a lower \"meat-to-everything else\" ratio).   While I did not try a cheeseburger \"Vatican style\" (with grilled cheese sandwiches as the \"bun\"), it was pretty cool looking and declared \"the best\" by my dining companion.   There are no shortage of \"cons\": it's a small place; the \"secret\" menu may be a little annoying; they sell cans of drinks, but have no recycling container (VERY un-Toronto-like; there is recycling on the street, but i hope BP will read this review and do the right thing); and it is not a value: (priest + high priest + Vatican style burger + 3 pops was $40! Each burger was pretty much $10). Still, it's the best burger I've had, even compared with $28 burgers at bourbon steak in Miami or the $40+ one at Daniel Boulud.  But like those burgers, this is not an \"everyday\" burger place - more like a few times a year.  I'd also rate it higher than Shake Shack, which is a lower-cost competitor, but not if you need to pay for airfare to NYC or Miami.  2015 post script: now on-site recycling is available (thanks!), but still cash only (wah)."}
{"text":"Worst time ever.. With 20$ you can get better deals and better burgers at McDonalds or Popeyes or Banh Mi Boys right across the street. Waste of time and the nastiest burgers I've ever had. Also the fries are salty like I'm actually eating salt. Total waste this place is popular just because of hype stuff on Instagram. Please save your money on something that is actually worth eating."}
{"text":"It's boggling my mind that anyone would rate this place any less than 5 stars. This place is INSANELY AMAZING. It's a small little restaurant but the food is ridiculous. Ever since I tried a burger here, I'll never be able to eat a burger anywhere else because NOTHING compares. I ordered the Priest Vatican style. The \"option\" is the best!! And the meat is so fresh. I will definitely keep coming back here!!"}
{"text":"Best burger in Toronto hands down. The only better burger I've had was Fergburger in Queenstown, NZ. I had the high priest which literally melts in your mouth. The cheesy is gooey and so tasty. The burger patty is juicy and so fresh. It falls apart when you eat it. I'm tempted to go back and get another as I write this. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I might sound like I am exaggerating, but I assure you, I am not. I don't think I have ever tasted anything as delicious as the burgers here. I keep it simple  and get  a cheeseburger because there is no reason to go for anything more complicated... the burger will speak for itself. Ever since I went here for the first time, I have not for a second in my life stopped craving the burgers from this place. You absolutely must go, I don't care where you're from or how far you have to drive. Your understanding of what 'burger' means will be changed forever. Side note: Holy Chuck has better milkshake options, but I'm guessing if you're going to a burger place you are craving burgers, not milkshakes; thus, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"I've eaten quite a few different gourmet burgers and sandwiches but based on the reviews and everything I've heard I thought it would be a bit better. I found it to be very greasy actually and not big enough for what you're paying. I think also maybe I was influenced by the very poor and rude service I received. I think at places like this the service should be friendly enough to be willing to provide some details on what the different burgers are like but they were barely able to talk to me here at all, much less help me decide what I wanted. Also the fries were not very good, which for me is a very important part of a burger meal."}
{"text":"Went to this Burger's Priest location for the first time in a long time. I have mixed feelings about Burger's Priest. I always feel disappointed due to the rave reviews and cult like following this chain has.  I noticed that Burger's Priest has changed from a hipster restaurant to a soulless corporate money grubbing hamburger chain. They are now opened on Sunday when they were always closed before!  Came here on Sunday evening. The restaurant is small and now have 8 small tables. I ordered the California Classic hamburger with fries and a chocolate milkshake. It cost more than 21 dollars!  The California Classic hamburger was small, but very juicy and tasty. The fries were okay, but have no salt on them. You have to get your own salt and pepper. The milkshake was okay. But I expected something more for 21 dollars.   The service was brusque and unfriendly. I hate these hipster restaurants and the people who work in them. They seem to act like they are doing you a favor for serving you. When I got my food, there were no ketchup or napkins in the bag. You have to get your own soft drink, napkins, ketchup, and salt and pepper. What kind of service is this?  The worst thing is that I have to wait 25 minutes to get my food. Everybody has to wait 20-25 minutes to get their food. I don't understand this. Does it take 25 minutes to fry a hamburger? I know they are busy, but don't they have hamburger patties ready to be cooked.  Would I go back? I doubt it. There are much better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I think I might have a slightly better experience dining in instead of doing take out & ordering something from the secret menu as opposed to a plain cheeseburger. I was definitely not too impressed with the meat in terms of how it was cooked. It felt very bland. As though just it's just ground beef, no spice, sauce or anything & just a slice of cheese. The fries at Burger Priest were likely the worst I've ever had. I prefer them crunchy but it was soft & a little oily. I tried a bite of my hubby's burger The Vatican. It was quite good & juicy. Veryyyy oily though. The shake was super small & overpriced (as with everything on the menu). It would be better if they had a bubble tea straw. Definitely order from the secret menu but skip the fries and everything else."}
{"text":"Tasted as good as the beaches location and came out super fast.   The dining room actually had tables to sit.   I got the burger with the mushroom and it was amazing as usually. I also got a root beer float and was also amazing.   It was oh so greasy but worth it once in a while.  Only complaint is the lack of debit. They have an ATM with a service fee."}
{"text":"*4.5 stars* for the quality, taste & experience. Deduction of .5 for portion size but this is relative to an individual's appetite. I arrived with an empty stomach, prepared to devour a massive burger so I did not order any sides and left still hungry for more. Quality definitely prevails over quantity at The Burger Priest so savour every juicy bite.  Their mission of \"Redeeming the burger one at a time\" is spot on. Since they arrived on the scene in Toronto, the burger buzz has been resurrected and they have set the bar high. Everyone flocking to this joint should expect extremely fresh beef and ingredients grilled to perfection - even the bun was delicious!  The Magnum & Blue Steel burgers will have me coming back as many times as I have watched Zoolander."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Got the Vatican fry combo along with a ice cream float. To heck with healthy when you can get a+ flavour and deliciousness."}
{"text":"If you are hungry, don't come here cause their portions are small and price is big. However, this is some of the tastiest burgers you can find. Their meats are juicy, but not oily, dense but not plastic, tasty but not full of salt. If you want to see what a GREAT burger should TASTE like, this is it. If you're wondering how much a burger can fill your stomach, just go to Five Guys"}
{"text":"Great burger but the place is constantly packed and lacks quality seating. A bit on the pricey side for what it is and a limited menu. The secret menu is cool, but can lead to people infront of you taking longer then necessary to order while they look it up on their smart phone. If your picking between the two in the uptown/midtown location I'd recommend Holy Chuck over it."}
{"text":"This is our favourite burger in Toronto.  The kids love it.  I love the \"smoke\" addition to my burger.  Shakes lack richness, but everything else is wonderful.  Small seating area, friendly service, and cash only."}
{"text":"great burger! really juicy and the bun & toppings were perfect.  I'll definitely be trying the priest the next time i visit.. mushrooms & cheese deep friend and topped on a beef patty with bacon & chesse.. could it get any better?"}
{"text":"This was my second time at a Burger's Priest, first time at this location. This one is a little bigger than the Queen St. location, but even still the lineup was out the door.  I tried the Option this time, and although I was worried about not getting the tried-and-true burger, I was NOT disappointed. This 'veggie' option was not a wimpy offering...this was deep fried amazing, oozing with cheese and deliciousness. Their fries are also maybe pushing Swiss Chalet out for \"faves\" for me. They were crispy, tasty and abundant. I think I enjoyed them and the Option equally, I REALLY really enjoyed it. I know they don't offer a lot of condiments...but honestly, you don't need all that crap taking away from the taste. I'm a minimalist when it comes to condiments anyway, but just trust me. It's good."}
{"text":"I waited way too long in a stuffy burger joint for this burger. They were so busy they ran out of fries and cookies. I guess the hype made everyone come here all at once.  Juicy burgers, a tad too salty though. Great bun and toppings.   Delicious burger place with burgers that are juicier than Craft Burger (now known as the Big Smoke Burger), but the Big Smoke has more exciting toppings.  I'd come back at lunch when it's dead or something but not when there's a big line-up. It's not worth the wait in that case but if there wasn't a wait I'd say it's a solid choice."}
{"text":"No parking for my car, so hubby had to run in and get take out and we ate in the car.  Minus 1 star.  No ketchup for my fries that were not as crispy as the original location combined with not just forgetting my extra high priest sauce but hardly putting any on at all, deduct another star from my favourite 5 star original Burgers Priest in the beaches.  Hubs said there was a guy inside eating a burger with McDonalds fries!  Ballsy!  But it is conveniently located across the street."}
{"text":"Okay, this place has grown on me. A simple cheeseburger is on par to Shake Shack in the US!!"}
{"text":"I love going here for lunch when I'm craving a burger. Today I got a double bacon cheeseburger with a side of fries and a can of pop ($16)  I love how fast and friendly the service is here. If they take longer than 12 mins your meal is free. Each location will have different time but it's usually under 15 mins.  The burger was really juicy and fresh. The fries were cook to perfection. The only thing I wish they change is to make the fries longer/bigger. They were short little niblets size fries but still very tasty!   Overall, if your in the area and don't want Yorkdale mall food court I would say stop by here since it's very close to the mall."}
{"text":"Generally these places are fine. However, my wife and her friend went to this location a couple weeks ago and the burgers were cold and soggy and they were disappointed. Part of paying the premium for a burger like this is the expectation of consistent quality. We submitted a complaint online but never heard back.    They don't need to comp anything, of course - but a response of some kind would have gone a long way (and prevented this review). There are alternative burger places in the city that also produce shake-shack-ripoff menus, and in the future, it's far more likely our money will go to one of them instead of BP."}
{"text":"Totally over rated or I went on an off day. Whatever it is, I do not plan to come back.  The staff was friendly, the place was clean, burger options were alright. Paid about $30 for a regular hamburger, cheese burger, fries and drinks but nothing to brag about imho.  The food didn't sit well with me.   Totally disappointed"}
{"text":"Got The priest to go and it was my first time trying. Pretty good, lots of cheese but I think it lacked a bit more sauce (just preference). Price isn't really justified in my opinion.   The portabello with cheese is definitely unique. If it were crispier (maybe cause I got take out) it would be better. The meat on the other hand I couldn't taste it being really special.  With the price I would prefer 2-3 burgers from In and Out or burger from Hodad's. Will try again without takeout to see if its better the 2nd time."}
{"text":"The Option - I went a few months ago because I wanted to try their vegetarian burger. The burger was very good, but it was such a small portion i was still extremely hungry. The burger was also way too expensive...10 dollars for a burger, without a combo. It's a ridiculous price making the burger not worth it."}
{"text":"Did not live up to the hype! We were disappointed because we wanted it to live up to what we've heard, \"big juicy and delicious\".  We found the burgers normal and a big price tag. We heard the downtown location is better and will try there one day."}
{"text":"If I want a really good burger that will not fail me, I always go here. My go to order is the magnum (blue cheese burger with bacon). I also tried the high priest and it tasted like a big mac that is not even good enough to compare. Every time we visit here there is always 15-20 mins wait in the line and 10-15 mins for the food. I also liked their fries, not too greasy and a big portion too! Will definitely keep on coming back here."}
{"text":"This is legit the best burger I have ever had... and I've had a few good burgers.  Despite some reservations, I went with The Priest, which is 1 cheeseburger patty and a cheese-stuffed portobello mushroom that's breaded and fried. Good god, that mushroom was a flavor explosion that totally MADE the burger. The patty was not too huge, well seasoned, the cheese was metled perfectly, and the BUN... the bun can make or break a burger and this one was moist and not too bready or thick. It's all about the bun.   Three of us split 2 orders of fries, which were delicious, but the serving size is pretty big so we could have done one for all of us and probably saved some cals. But then again, who is really thinking about calories when eating a juicy, greasy cheeseburger?  Just like the east side locale, this one has VERY limited seating. We managed to snag some, despite the rather stuffed room and large lineup, but you may end up having to take your burgers to go and eating them on a bench outside, or home if you live close by. Either way, it's still 100% worth it.  I know I seem like such a keener, giving Burger's Priest 5 stars, but I can't not... it's rare that something so hyped actually manages to live up to my overblown expectations."}
{"text":"Fresh good simple burgers. In the top 3 places / brands for burgers in GTA (but not 1st place).  You have to go on their website first to see the burgers, which are not listed on the walls there (the \"secret\" ones)"}
{"text":"By far one of the best cheeseburger I've ever had, and their option burger is just as amazing.  I've been to this location several times and each time the burger came out consistently good, which is not easy.  Their patties are fresh and cooked to perfect medium rare, and the presentation of the burger always look tantalizing with the soft buns.  I love their burger to say the least!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in the city in my opinion. And this has been my opinion for about 4 years now, even when they only had one downtown location. Super pleased with the Dufferin location, great customer service, even when ordered via Uber Eats.  Cali Classic hands down!!!! Thanks Dufferin BP (you're the best!)"}
{"text":"Burger's Priest is no longer much of a secret to Toronto folk, as the lines are regularly quite long. This location is not ideal for a sit-down meal, so plan to take-out or fight for one of the few tables.  FRIES: A bit soggier and blander than I hoped, and pretty standard variety for most burger places.  SHAKE: The mint milkshake was disappointing. It was small, and didn't distinguish itself much from the kind of shake you can get at a typical fast-food joint. Furthermore, it kept leaking due to an irregularly shaped lid that the waitress didn't seem too particularly concerned about.  BURGER: Now this is where Burger's Priest earns it's 4 stars for me. The basic burger is what it is - basic, and not much to write about. The secret menu burger's though, as pricey as they are, are what really sets this place apart. I recommend the Vatican City burger, but do NOT recommend attempting to eat this while in a car (it's a tasty oily mess!).  SUMMARY: In my continuing search for the best burger in Toronto, Burger's Priest still reigns supreme."}
{"text":"Best burgers ever.  They amuse me every time I visit the different locations. Good milkshakes and the burgers are FRESH! the lettuce quantity can be added more. Their Priest (secret sauce) sauce is delecious! Some places only accept cash with is the down side. But they have a atm machine."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: The best burger joint in town finally gets seats so you no longer have to freeze your ass off in line!  This location easily beats their Queen East one simply because there's enough room to wait inside...and man what a difference it makes on a cold winter's day!   There's really nothing I can say that hasn't already been said in the combined 166 reviews of both locations. My favourite burger remains the Priest - their signature juicy cheese burger with the Option - aka, deep fried portabello with melted cheese goodness. It's a bit annoying that they don't post their \"secret menu\" since it's readily Google-able, so here it is:  1. High Priest: it's essentially their version of the Big Mac 2 .Holy Smokes: the double w/ jalapenos 3. Judgement Day: the cheese burger with 2 Options 4. Armageddon: the Judgement Day with an additional cheese patty 5. Noah's Ark: the Option with chili and cheese on a bun 6. Religious Hypocrite: the Option with bacon 7. Vatican City: the double w/ two grilled cheese sandwiches in place of buns (tip: book an appointment with your cardiologist whilst you're waiting...) 8. Tower of Babel: the Vatican City with an Option squeezed in (tip: forget the cardiology appointment - even modern medicine won't be able to save you now...)  Also, you can add \"smoke\" (jalapenos) to any of your orders or get your double made \"Jarge\" style (they'll fry it ballpark mustard).  Finally, if there's anything I would like to see if they open another location (rumours are they're looking for a west side location...) is more communal seating like Hrvati or Wvrst, and BEER. Please, please, please get your liquor license! How fitting would it be to pair your burger with some Trappist beers?"}
{"text":"Better than McD's but I am not a fan. I ate here when it first opened up and never went back until my office order it last week. The burgers were tiny and there was nothing special about these burgers. BLAH. Sorry....I don't understand how there are so many great reviews. Perhaps you haven't had 5 guys???"}
{"text":"It's about time Toronto got an AWESOME burger joint! Everything here is made to perfection. I love that cheesy Portobello thing (you know what I'm talking about). The trip (and sometimes waiting time) is well worth it. They have off-menu items. I can't remember what they're called but we all tried each others burgers (we're the type of family that doesn't care to drink from the same glass) and they were all really good!"}
{"text":"All the hype of Burger Priest finally got to me today and I decided to try some. I don't know if I just got the wrong item (Magnum) but I was very unimpressed. The blue cheese seemed to be a spread rather than crumble and I only got one slice of bacon on my small burger. The highlight of my meal were the chili cheese fries which were good. I didn't like the restaurant itself though, it was so darn hot in there I doubt they even needed to turn on the stove top.   The service, though limited, I found was horrible. While waiting for my food, a lady was trying to get on her stool and she fell. Apparently, the stool tipped while she was getting on, and she fell pretty hard. The crowded store stopped all conversation to watch and check if she was okay, The staff, however, just kept making and taking the orders. The lady quickly left flustered."}
{"text":"2.5 star  I chowed down a High Priest ($8.99) in record time... Not because it is the best burger I had... I just want to make sure the grease and oil not going to drip everywhere or just become solid if I take my time...  There was no lines... no one waiting on a weekday afternoon at Burger's Priest. I don't really understand why would there be 20 people lining up for a burger?? For me the burger still a 2 star... the extra 0.5 is for no waiting and I got to sit down with AC and enjoy my burger... Much better than The Beach location.  Damn!! $10.16 tax in for my Burger Priest's Big Mac version burger... with no fries or drinks... definitely not worth the wait or the price!"}
{"text":"Burger's Priest is a pure burger joint. If you want a gourmet burger go to the Burger Cellar. If you want guacamole go to Hero Burger, Acme burger or some other half-assed burger chain. If you want to eat at a place that cares about the meat, then you must go to the Burger's Priest. Just look at the tray of freshly ground beef sitting by the griddle; red, round, simple. Lovingly transformed into one of the best burgers I've ever tasted. It's worth the wait. As a matter of fact, the wait is a part of the experience; tunes blaring, the crowd waiting expectantly, the line carefully cooking and crafting the burgers. It thrilling to be a part of it.  Expensive? Hell yeah! Go to McDonald's if you want cheap.   Try the High Priest (secret menu)-- it's a Big Mac done as it should be. Transcendent. The Tower of Babel is a monster. Perhaps a one time experience. One criticism is when you order 'smoke' you don't get enough jalapeños. The fries are pretty great too. Meaty dreams!"}
{"text":"Bomb ass burgers but a shitty cashier. I gave her a $50 bill and in return I got $3, instead of $33... They also forgot my milkshake."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday evening with a friend - it was around 6:30 and was pretty full - had to wait 15 minutes just to order at the front and then another 10 minutes for them to make my order.   Got the chilli cheese fries - the fries were good but very salty, but it had a good amount of chilli and cheese as well. My friend got the grilled cheese hot dog, which we did not expect would be a hot dog between two grilled cheese sandwiches...the hotdog had nothing to hold on to and kept slipping out from her sandwich. It wasn't a large sausage, either, so she finished it within minutes, and even though she ordered after me and got her food 15 minutes later, she had to watch me eat the rest of my chili fries until I asked her to pitch in.  What was funny was that this large party came in (and the store was very busy already) and they started pulling tables together and taking seats from nearby tables and made a long table...because they were celebrating their daughter's birthday party! People kept pouring in for this party, which caught the workers a little off guard, I think. Luckily I had already ordered and had my food, but my friend ended up ordering after some members of the party had ordered and so she had to wait immensely long for a simple hotdog.  Overall, food is okay, service isn't that great. Don't come out of your way to visit this place - but if you're free for dessert, visit the Demetre's across the street!"}
{"text":"Good food...but Didn't really enjoy the attitude served with my burgers. Ahem, Melinda."}
{"text":"I just have one thing to say about this place: AWESOME burgers and LOVELY people!  Yay, I'm a FAN!"}
{"text":"Pretty good spot. Walked right up to the counter and ordered. The employees were very nice and helped me make a selection. Since I tend to not eat a lot of red meat, I selectees their \"The Token\" chicken sandwich. It had buffalo chicken, sliced blue cheese, lettuce and tomato. It was just the right size. It filled me up. My family members ordered fries and they're huge! So it was definitely enough to share with 2-3 people. The decor is kitschy and cute. Goes along with the Catholic theme. A tad sacrilege but hey it's decor, I can't be too sensitive. If they had one in the states I would be back."}
