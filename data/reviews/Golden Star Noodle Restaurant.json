{"text":"Anyone going to this place needs to try the spicy chicken... Cantonese chow mein and chicken fried rice with wings on top! Very good!"}
{"text":"Fried rice and chicken for $3? I say yes! and so does this place! All week until 2.30pm.

It's a small portion, decent for lunch with a few cut up pieces of chicken, and you can ask for sweet and sour sauce. It's perfect for lunch and I don't feel guilty. 

During the weekdays though try to avoid the noon hour as it's packed with high school kids."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this small Chinese restaurant for years and they always had reasonably priced generous portions. But they've obviously changed management and the new cook has NO CLUE how to prepare Black Pepper Beef on sizzling plate, previously my fave dish. FYI it is beef tenderloin pieces in a savoury soy black pepper sauce saut√©ed with green onions and other veggies. It does NOT have a sweet batter on the beef pieces as if they were chicken balls, nor does doing a sweet tasting sauce and sprinkling a huge amount of black pepper on everything at the last minute turn it into the  dish known as black pepper beef, as everybody but this new cook knows! It tasted something like beef pancakes, horribly sweet. They might as well have dumped maple syrup on it. I have never been so horrified! Look, if you didn't know how to make it, why did you leave it on the menu when you took over the restaurant? I have given it two stars instead of one because the other food, the chicken wings, shrimp Szechuan and chicken and salt fish rice were OK. But we had to SCREAM for 10 minutes at the only woman behind the counter before she finally heard us and refilled our drinks. She claimed she didn't hear us though my daughter had been waving at her wildly for some time and there was only one other group of people at the other table in the restaurant. I will never be back after that cook ruining my favourite dish, the black pepper beef."}
