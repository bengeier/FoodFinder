{"text":"Service and atmosphere was really great and had a fun twist on decor. Food came out quickly and the portion size was large. Got the la vaca loca that had the steak. Flavoring was great, but ordered with the green sauce and I didn't really taste or see it in the burrito so maybe it was forgotten? So instead I loaded it with the side of salsa given and side of guacamole that I ordered and omg so good! Salsa and guac was awesome and so fresh. Definitely will be going back for a nice quick lunch"}
{"text":"We will absolutely come back.  Excellent food @ very casual  place and friendly!!! The portion is very reasonable compared to what you pay for."}
{"text":"I had a really cool first impression of this place. It finally opened last week and I went in Sunday night about 7ish. They were closed but when I walked up, they waved me in. Obed, Brandon and Scott were cleaning up and working away. I told them I was really excited to eat there and was happy they were there. So close, as I usually drive into Phoenix for a good burrito.   They invited me in and showed me around. The owner said, \"you know, we're figuring things out up here and got so many new customers today, we're out of the meats, but pull up a chair, lemme whip you something up man.\" Sure enough, he grills me up a couple of quesadillas! They're cleaning up and having a couple beers out of a Tecate box that was sitting on the bar. He then says \"dude, grab a beer.\"    What a cool thing to do. I think that impression was better than having been able to sit down and have that burrito I've been craving for months. Needless to say, I came back and had a burrito the next day. It was great. I'll be a regular.  I had the bird and turf. It was great! I'll be trying the rest soon.   It's all about the people and I think these guys are great. Smart guys who understand how important it is to make a first impression. Check em out."}
{"text":"Best burritos ever! And the friendliest employees! A destination place for us in carefree, plus carefree is such a fun little town to visit!"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant addition to Cave Creek. Huge, fresh tasty burritos with top quality ingredients. Great vibe at this place!"}
{"text":"Very average food. I can make a better burrito at home with canned beans from Trader Joe's and some better cheese than they use here."}
{"text":"Where has this place been!? Love it. Everything about it. I wish we there was more space to sit down but other than that this is a Cave Creek gem. Do not talk about \" maybe trying this in the future\" go now!  Pay close attention to menu options. Great offerings to customize even these simple menu items. Been there 3 times now and everything is great!"}
{"text":"The green Chile pork burrito was out of this world! Definitely will go back for more!"}
{"text":"Really good Burritos! with very authentic flavors. Almost wanted to dock a star as the burritos are very small, with a good portion being the tortilla. Then i thought there is no other mexican food within 25 miles from this place."}
{"text":"Great burritos! My husband made a comment that the chorizo was some of the best he's had! We ordered take out and the only down side was they forgot to include our chips and salsa that we paid for."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here twice now. The first time was in 2016 and we loved it.  Had I left a review in 2016 I would have given it a 5 but after our 2017 visit we were a little disappointed.  In 2016 the chips were home made and warm. All of the salsa and burrito ingredients seemed fresh and very flavorful in 2016.  In 2017 the chips were home made but seemed like they were premade and stored (not warm).  The burritos seemed similar, it tasted like everything was pre prepared and then warmed and served.  I will certainly go back and give them another chance because the first time was so good.  I hope we just caught them on a bad day in 2017."}
{"text":"The food is really wonderful. Full flavored and they have some great choices. However, the service that I have received at the front has not been so wonderful. There is a guy that works up front that always seems like he has too much to handle. He is not professional. There was one time a girl worked the front and she was very pleasant and nice. She was calm and seemed like she could handle the chaos of their busy hour."}
{"text":"I have tried this place three times. The first time I tried a breakfast burrito and the flavor was ok but my potatoes were pretty rare and ruined it. The second time I got carnitas with green chili and it was good. My third time I ordered the same thing but this time the carnitas were over cooked and dry with there being large crunchy chilies that ruined the texture. My experience has not been good or consistent. If the hours were better and the food was cooked with consistancy I would try it again but for now I'll seek my burritos else where."}
{"text":"Had a solid first experience here over the weekend. The girl working at the counter was friendly and walked us thru the menu after we explained that this was our first time in. I tried to order a burrito that included chorizo but they were out of that so I'll save it for my next trip. The \"fry plates\" are basically nachos with French fries in place of chips and that was quite good. My only knock on the place is that the burrito should either be full of more ingredients or they should use a smaller tortilla. I shouldn't be biting into several layers of tortilla in my burrito.   We'll definitely be back to check out more of the menu soon."}
{"text":"Food and service excellent I hope the make it especially when it's close to home. The flavor of the pork burrito was fantastic and the tortilla was delicious. My only issue was after eating a $9.00 burrito I was still hungry.  I know I'm a pig but a couple more scoops for the guts would make me come back more often! Pork isn't that expensive to make it a lunch or meal to remember, or at least fill this hog up!"}
{"text":"Probably the best burrito I've ever had.... Only problem is they were not open and this was my first time visiting his place. Driving in from Sedona, and heard of couple of spots to try one was closed, which is my fault for not checking ahead... but this spot is supposed to be open, nope doors locked and inside black, will probably never be on that side of town again, so I won't be able to tell people how great this place was or is..... If they were open, no signs of why closed and the time was 11:30 when I came through."}
{"text":"Unplanned lunch, wifey having just got weekly fix at Kiwanis. Food and service was good, staff were attentive and took time to explain the menu board. We sat outside, no noticeable traffic noise."}
{"text":"This restaurant unfortunately has consistently gone downhill since it opened, now to top it off they are sneaking in gratuity on your check for to go orders without notifying the customer in advance, deceitful business practice I won't be returning"}
{"text":"I like this place, but I'm dropping one star. As others have said, service can be very slow. I ordered a to-go order, and my burritos were done pretty quickly, and there they sat on the counter. The counter person took orders, filled people's drinks, chatted and I waited, and waited, and waited. Over 10 minutes later they got my burrito and brought it over. The owners needs to instruct their staff that people's existing orders should be delivered to people waiting BEFORE taking new orders."}
{"text":"Great place! Got the steak burrito with black beans to go, red sauce. It was really fresh and really tasty and traveled home very well. Still super hot 15 minutes later because they wrap it right and they were not busy when I was there. A bit pricey, $9 for a steak burrito but you get what you pay for. It's pretty big and the steak was lean, no fat. The beans and veggies were fresh and everything was perfectly proportioned. I look forward to trying other items for sure. The breakfast 'ritos look like they put french fries on 'em....ok!"}
{"text":"Great burritos and great salsa. My only \"wish\" is that they'd throw a few chips in the basket with each burrito. Nice seating out front facing south (for Fall-Winter-Spring) and a big bar for seating inside.  I used to fly all over for business and these burritos stand up against any good ones I liked out of state. I'll be back..."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and you can get the breakfast burritos all day.  They make it very easy to modify menu items for preferences."}
{"text":"Good burritos, great chorizo. But fries in a burrito is a bit too weird for me. Will go back to sample some of the other meats because my bacon was just alright."}
{"text":"The burrito that blew my mind!!!! I had the steak burrito Christmas style (red and green sauce)!  So amazing! VERY casual , almost too casual.  You can walk in here in your pajamas and fit in.  No tables just a bar along the wall.  They DO have margaritas!    You guys hit the mark on the food!  The only thing I would like as an option is grilled potatoes as a choice for inside the burrito instead of french fries.  Sorry, can't wrap my head around french fries INSIDE a burrito?"}
{"text":"It was about 12:30pm and this semi-new burrito place had only been open 2 hours. They claimed that had run-out of pork and chicken already. Let's be honest, whoever ships their pork and chicken never showed up. Why bother lying to customers when you screwed up. Only real BBQ places run out of food early. Whoever owns this place should be embarrassed about that situation.     Luckily, the food they did have turned out average. One person had the steak burrito and it was a bit spicy, but the steak was lean and the burro had good flavors. My carne asada quesadilla at $8.79 might have been a touch overpriced and was really nothing special. The carne asada was lean and they gave you the sour cream and salsa on the side, but it was still a rather mundane quesadilla. These folks opened up another restaurant next door, but I would call ahead to make sure they didn't run out of any items that you might want."}
{"text":"WINNER WINNER BURRITO DINNER.. Yep that's it right there wrapped up in a flour tortilla.. Killer service from a very excited chica knowing her yab well.( And being cool to Touristas)  And the rolled goodness of this Mexican/ modern/ flavorful burritos. SO...Don't waist your time at the fry bread joint up the street...Come down here and get some of this in your belly hole.. Oh and buy a shirt to.. ..If only they had my size,,,,Med. Husky..!"}
{"text":"The shrimp burrito was AMAZING. The wait was a little long even though there were no other customers. Also there was very minimal seating inside which was a turn off but luckily it was nice outside and the food was worth waiting for!"}
{"text":"Great little place to grab lunch.  Everything very fresh even the homemade lemonade and aqua fresca.  I have tried the shrimp burrito and the vada loca and both were very good."}
{"text":"Awesome local burro shop in Cave Creek. Try one of their signature burritos. My recommendation is the Puerto Loco."}
{"text":"I love the idea of this restaurant more than what I experienced. I had a bird and turf burrito and it was gone in about 2 mins. There really wasn't much to it at all. It tasted just fine, wasn't really that special, but had good flavor. But for $10?! Too expensive.   My partner had the La Vaca Loca. He thought it was fine, flavors were good. But again, quantity is too light, and price is too high. (Also, $3 for a coke? Common guys)  Staff was friendly and helpful, and we didn't wait long. But I left feeling hungry and frustrated.   My hope is that this restaurant will work on their portion sizes, especially with all the big guys / bikers coming through, and bring the prices down to something more reasonable. I don't care if this is Cave Creek.  We need more quick lunch places in this area bad!"}
{"text":"Went around 4 on a Saturday, I was starving so this review may be a tad influenced by that factor. Good eats, cool environment. I'd go again."}
{"text":"Only 4 stars because of the confusing menu.  But about as good as it gets. Check out my blog post on Burritoholics  https://the032.me/  Let me know what you think!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice & the burritos & quesadillas were excellent. Adding  soft drinks & chips makes it pretty expensive for a counter type restaurant. Only seating is counter stools facing the wall."}
{"text":"I am soooo excited that they have finally made their way up here! I grew up going to El Sol and El Zocalo, so having them so close is fantastic! The service is amazing! They care about the quality of their food and what they are serving, so they want to make your experience awesome."}
{"text":"This place rocks! I got a veggie burrito and changed/added a bunch of stuff but they were totally cool about it and the burrito was delicious! Also the chef was so thoughtful about my veggie burrito, he asked me if I was vegan/vegetarian because their rice is made in chicken broth and he didn't want me to eat meat on accident. I'm not strict about it I just don't like the texture of meat. Anyywhooo this place is gr8 and the people that work there are so sweet and really care about you forsuree coming back!"}
{"text":"Great burritos for a great price. Better than any burrito chain. You won't be disappointed! My Kevin dad love the chorizo with jalapeños. I'm more tame choosing the pollo. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Outstanding burritos, great for breakfast or lunch, margaritas are really good as well"}
{"text":"New place in town - nice to have some options!    Had the Vaca Loca.  Great flavors.  Loved the finish on the tortilla - though it made it a bit tough to eat - it kept breaking up, and had to resort to knife and fork.  Perhaps thats the way God intended it?  Anyway - the only complaint is my burrito was almost $9, but I really only found a small amount - really small amount - of steak in the burrito.  It reminded me of those newer Soup-Sandwich-Salad places where you get 1/2 a teaspoon of corn kernels, 1 teaspoon of sunflower seeds, 3.1 oz of chicken, etc.  It felt like it was a LOT of beans, and very little protein.  Again - the flavors were spot on... the beans were great, the salsa - perfect.  Will probably give it a second chance, but for the price - and no sides - I expected a little more.  Will be interesting to check out the restaurant when that opens up.  Service was pleasant and fast.  Clean.  Great job guys."}
{"text":"Good food,  good place to grab a quick meal your way.  The menu is simple and you order your sides to suit your mood"}
{"text":"SLOW!!! Overpriced! Burritos are made one at a time and it takes so long to make another one that the first will be cold. Fries are awful there. Calling ahead does not help cause they forget about your order before you get there. Small burritos for 6-10 dollars."}
{"text":"The food here is good - but the service is SO slow. They only ever have 2 ppl working, even during dinner rush and there is no urgency. We have this place a second chance and still very slow. I hope they get their stuff together so they stick around... otherwise I don't think many people will put up with the wait factor - especially on to-go orders. Like I said, the food is tasty though - they just need to figure out the business and customer service aspect. We probably won't be back for some time - because there are a lot of good food choices around us that do have it down."}
{"text":"We came with the family and really enjoyed everything that we tasted.  The cheese quesadilla was absolutely delicious and La Vaca Loca is a killer burrito.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"We been here a few times now and it's the best take out in the area. The burritos are phenomenal and the fries plates divine. Perfect size menu, food is fresh and seasoned to perfection. This place is great anytime of the day, but perfect for brunch when some people want breakfast and some lunch. The portions are huge. Next time I'll have to try the margarita."}
{"text":"We love the food here, it is like a little bit of heaven on a tortilla. I wish they had more seating, but the food is good enough for me to over look that."}
{"text":"Very good burrito spot. The ingredients are fresh and I LOVE the flavor of the refried beans."}
{"text":"Fabulous burrito bar.  The food is Excellent regardless of what some of the Yelp Business assassination squad members have asserted here previously.  The tortillas are fresh the ingredients are excellent the value is very good.    We sampled the chorizo breakfast burrito and the bean and cheese.  We will be regulars here often.    Shrimp is an expensive protein in many ways...and I find the pricing consistent with other venues around the valley.    The Yelp bloviating bloggers and amateur food critics continue to do a disservice to businesses all over America.      We are fortunate to have this wonderful business in the Creek.  For more mature reviews on all businesses please head over to TripAdvisor.com.  I hope Jill S does not live in Cave Creek.  She exemplifies all that is wrong with YELP!  Pretentious women acting as if they now anything about food or running a business."}
{"text":"I ordered steak fries at 1:19.  At 1:40 I inquired about my food and was told that it was being made, that all the food was made to order.  By this time the group that I was with had all received their food including an order of steak fries.  Five minutes later I was informed that they were all out of steak, that a bunch of people had ordered steak and they were out.  They offered to make me chicken fried instead and I said ok.  By 1:56 my food still wasn't ready so at that point I went in and had them give me my money back.  The fries still were not ready.  I'm not sure what ultimately happened with them.  One cashier was nice and apologized, the other not as much.  Needless to say, I will never be back."}
{"text":"REALLY good La Vaca Loca Burrito for me & Carne Asada Quesadilla for my friend.  Ingredients tasted fresh, & tortillas were STUFFED!  Well done!"}
{"text":"Such a great addition to Cave Creek/Carefree area!  The burritos are fabulous...they will open their larger restaurant  the first week of May.  They have a few tables outside, and a bar area to sit at inside, but it is pretty much a take out place right now.  The food is delicious and we are SO happy they are here!  Can't wait for the bigger restaurant that is right next door to open.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Sadly this place just could not make it.  It is now closed.  Our first visit and it was an excellent experience.  We were greeted quickly and made our orders of Crazy Chicken and Bird and Turf.  Not sure what all the complaints were about the burrito being too skimpy.  Every bite on my burrito were chocked full of chicken, salsa and beans.  My hubby enjoyed the chorizo and chicken combo burrito.  The tortilla was soft and stayed together while eating.  Nice to have this place close to home.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Good service and perfectly ok burritos.  Price was a little high."}
{"text":"I really love the burritos they serve here but I don't really like the attitude from the employees. Every time we go in there it's the same girl working and she must have something against us. I'm not sure. One time we were waiting inside for a to go order and we sat the same employee get up on the counter with here dirty shoes and when she got down she didn't clean it off. Grose."}
{"text":"Awesome food with authentic Mexican flavor. Will not disappoint. Chicken with spicy sauce is amazing"}
{"text":"From the reviews, i had high expectations for this place, connected to the new Mexican Food restaurant that took over the Binkley's space. First of all, the service was crushingly slow and the menu board takes a bit of time to decipher. The food is made quickly, but i have to say that while the bean burrito and shrimp quesadilla were good, the shrimp burrito was terrible. To their credit, they use really good shrimp, not that farmed mush shrimp you get in most places. Chips came with a tiny salsa that runs out half way through. The patio in the back was dull as was the indoor area. Take out is the better plan. Canned beer and bitter margaritas did not take the edge off of the meal. Hard to see the reason to come here rather than any other Mexican food place, like Filobertos, for instance, which is less money too. I can not recommend this place, we wont be going back."}
{"text":"Love the new place.  Great burritos and margaritas.  Welcome to Cave Creek glad to have the new tasty option in town.  Can't wait for your other new location to open."}
{"text":"This is a very casual restaurant. There is a counter with stools indoors and outside they have tables next to the parking lot.  Nice variety of Burritos offered."}
{"text":"My wife and I are still new to Cave Creek and are exploring all the local spots.  We were excited to try a new breakfast spot so my wife picked up a couple breakfast burritos to bring back home.  We both really wanted to like this but it was pretty bad.  We both had bacon, egg, and cheese burritos which come with seasoned fries inside.  She modified hers to include egg whites, and avocado I believe.  I found my burrito to be very flavorless with runny eggs, and some uncooked seasoned fries.  The bacon was also on the under cooked side for me.  My wife's feedback was similar but her burrito included a bonus side order of a long jet black hair.  My wife is blond and i have light brown hair so definitely not ours.  Unfortunately she had already had several bites before noticing.  She tossed her's in the trash and I also discarded mine about half way.  Not worth the calories I'm afraid.  I think we're going to stick with Saddle Creek Coffee because it's consistently great."}
{"text":"Ok wasn't sure about this place from the reviews and the menu.  Very hidden I almost missed the turn but once I found it I was happy I did.  I had the ham egg and cheese burrito it was amazing!!!!  Def my place to go if north of north scottsdale.  Amazing food relaxed vibe. Great place to go"}
{"text":"Local, quick and delish.  Bird & Turf is great, salsa is fresh!  This is your go to for a quick casual dinner out or to go."}
{"text":"This burrito was SO fresh and really allowed me to taste every ingredient. It's not very expensive and has such attentive and nice staff. They also have some outside patio seating -- would DEFINITELY recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The burritos are tasty, especially the tortilla and how it is prepared. Love the fries in the burrito and the salsa. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. The only downside is I love my breakfast burrito, but they don't open until 10am! I can only come here when I wake up late for breakfast, otherwise I am too hungry by the time it opens in the AM. Looking forward to trying this place for lunch as well."}
{"text":"Awesome place, the guys working here were super friendly and helpful! Burrito tasted great, their pork is very tender.  Think we just found our new favorite burrito place!"}
{"text":"Food was good-friendly service,  eat-in area is quite small-3 stars because at 11am the bathroom was still destroyed from the night before-"}
{"text":"Fantastic burrito! Very filling and delicious. Worth the stop if you're in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Cave Creek is in dire need of good Mexican.  Unfortunately, Burritoholics will not be the savior.  :(  DH and I stopped in yesterday on our way home from a hike.  He had the pork burrito with a side of refried beans, and I had the steak burrito.  He liked the flavors in his pork burrito and the beans, however, the beans were $2 and served in a 3-ounce condiment cup.  Probably all of about 1/4 cup of beans.  And the burrito was hardly a meal.  My steak burrito was tragic.  It was about half the size of his, barely filled, and rather tasteless.  It was about the thickness of the $1 frozen burritos you get in the grocery store. I'm looking at the pictures posted on this listing, and what I got was NOTHING like the show plates.  It was also SUPER dry, but again, that's because it was ALL tortilla, and virtually no filling.  Prices - ridiculous for the portion size.  My burrito was $8.59, and should have been $4 for the size and quantity.  Small fountain sodas are $2.79. !!.   Two burritos, the side of beans, and two drinks was $25.  If you're thinking you're going to get a big fat burrito, which we expected, judging on the prices, you're going to be sadly disappointed.  Filibertos, Rubios, Arriba - all serve huge stuffed burritos for less than the price here.    It's fast food, served VERY slowly (15 minute wait with only 2 people in front of us).  Our orders came out 7 minutes apart, too.  But the prices are in line with a sit-down meal and portion size.  Huge disconnect all the way around.  Rather bummed, as we were looking forward to having a new go-to place in town.  I understand they are opening a sit-down Mexican next door, which looked super cute (LOVED the flooring!), but after this experience, we won't even bother."}
{"text":"Portion size was more than I could handle. Left overs for sure!  Freshly made and so tasty! We'll be back often....may become regulars. Must try! Shaken margarita was very good!"}
{"text":"Big burritos at a great price. We had the Puerco Loco burrito and the shrimp burrito, both of which were delicious."}
{"text":"Good burritos and low key environment. Also great because if you want to \"upgrade\" ypu can go to the restraunt next door as they are owned by the same company."}
{"text":"Burritoholics knows how to make a killer burrito. I will definitely be back for their El Puerco Loco burrito."}
{"text":"Way over priced for the portion size. If the quality of the food was good, I probably would not mind. All the salsas were very salty, especially the green (almost unbearable to eat). No place to really sit inside, with blasting music so load you just want to leave. Like a night club from the 70s. Fries were fresh cut but hard as a rock. Amount of meat inside of the burritos was scarce. Probably less than 3oz. My chicken was chewy but had good spice. The service was friendly and prompt from the counter guy. He went beyond expatiation. Well done. Restaurant it's self was dirty. The back patio had a dirty mop bucket sitting in plan view with a foul smell. All this is a reflection on the management. Will not be going back there or their other restaurant attached. Too bad, we really need quality restaurants in Cave Creek / Carefree. Based on the reviews I was expecting something way better."}
{"text":"Great people, great food, and a place Cave Creek needed!!  Today I got the chicken and turf burrito with extra grilled jalapenos.  Excellent excellent excellent.  Not too spicy just right.  Several people got the shrimp burrito and one or two got the trees oh and nobody was disappointed."}
{"text":"I tried Burritoholics for the first time on Cinco de Mayo.  I was wanting to celebrate the holiday with some good Mexican food, and this place did not disappoint!  I hadn't eaten all day, so I placed a large takeout order consisting of the Bird N' Turf burrito, a carne asada quesadilla, a side of rice, and a pint of salsa.  I was very impressed by the flavor in everything I ate, and felt that the price I paid was quite comparable to a Chipotle or Rubio's, but the quality of the food was significantly better.  I thoroughly enjoyed the feast I had and will definitely make Burritoholics a go-to destination for quality and affordable Mexican food on my way home from work.  Looking forward to trying more menu items in the weeks ahead."}
{"text":"Absolutely scrumptious! The bad reviews really don't belong here as they don't deserve them.   I had the egg, bacon and cheese burrito and it was absolutely wonderful. They add seasoned fries to the burrito that I had and it was super tasty.  The prices are moderate but definitely reasonable. The staff is super friendly and welcoming and I might just become addicted to this place."}
{"text":"Burritoholics AZ for dinner tonight!!! We picked it up to go, and their burritos travel well!!! Crazy chicken: yum! My boys (3 and 5) enjoyed their portion. Bird N Turf: great flavors, chorizo isn't my fav, but it was a great combo! Shrimp-erito: top notch!!! And not skimpy on the shrimp either. The grand finale: the El Puerco Loco. Good god, I need more of that in my life. Side note: The spice factor is up there! Personally, I loved it, as I enjoy my mouth tingling and lips on fire after a good burro. My husband is a self proclaimed spice-wimp. He enjoyed the Puerco Loco and the salsa though!!! We will be back!!! YUM!"}
{"text":"Went here after my husband told me about a new place in CC that was getting rave reviews. Well the reviews were not wrong! Hubby had the SHRIMP BURRITO and I had STEAK CON CARNE. BOTH items were very good. The BURRITO was filled with nice meaty shrimp, and had a good fresh flavor. The CON CARNE was an interesting dish(I loved it) It is their homemade seasoned French fries topped with steak, cheese, pico, jalapenos and sour cream. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Cool little place in the back of cave creek. My wife and I both ordered the sausage burrito. The flavor was good, the tortilla was great, the sauces were great the only thing I would've asked for is a little more. The burritos were the perfect size for my wife but left a little more to be desired for myself."}
{"text":"Stopped by here today because they were getting rave reviews on Facebook. They unofficially opened last Thursday and are getting some serious attention.  Tried their slow cooked pork, crazy chicken, and shrimp burritos. All were so delicious, full of flavor. They offer 2 different sauces. I have to say, they put chipotle and Rubios to shame. They will get their liquor license next week. And eventually open up a restaurant next door with more extensive menu offerings.  It's easy in and out location right off the cave creek road.  The staff are very friendly, will be back (maybe tomorrow )."}
{"text":"The flour tortillas were fresh & delicious, but the burritos were not. Disappointing, as I love a great burrito, but will not go back. I also  found the hostess/cash register woman loud & annoying."}
{"text":"The employees are very friendly and more than helpful to us on our first visit here. The fresh made lemonade and iced tea are very good. The chips and salsa are delicious. I ordered the El Puerco Loco and it was just ok. The pork was good, but the rice was soggy. I like mexican rice and this rice was watery. Also, too much sauce... It was good sauce, but it overpowered the burrito. We went next door to the art gallery and had a delicious cupcake after lunch!"}
{"text":"This place is EXCELLENT!  I had the chicken burrito with black beans and green sauce.  Delicious!  Expertly prepared with all house made products.  Chips are great.  Salsa is great. Burrito is OUTSTANDING!  The service is great too!  Ill be there at least twice a week."}
{"text":"The good:    *Food was good.  Not mind blowing, but good.    *The horchata was delicious and authentic...not overly sweet which I liked.    The NOT so good:  *EXTREMELY slow service!!!!!!!!!  Our simple quesadilla and burrito took 20 minutes and there were only two orders ahead of us.  We went at noon on a Saturday and lots of people came in behind us.  They had only one cook and a cashier.  Should add another cook during lunch and dinner rush hours.    *Awful country music playing very loudly on the radio.  Barf!!!  How about some Latin music or something else fun?  We heard a song with the lyrics...'you look like I need a drink' wtf?! Lol"}
{"text":"Heard good things, but disappointed.Had the CrazyChicken burrito, chicken so over cooked, flour tortilla crumbled with every bite. Not some place I would recommend or return."}
