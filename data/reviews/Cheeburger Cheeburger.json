{"text":"I can't believe people have bad reviews of this place because we've been here a number of times and it's always been great! They even have gluten-free buns! Yum!"}
{"text":"Great place to bring the kids.   Good burgers, good shake, good fries.   Limited menu that they execute well.    Kids meals come in cute cardboard oldies cars."}
{"text":"I am really surprised by the negative reviews.  This place is awesome!!  We have been here twice now and both times were equally great.  As a fried pickle connoisseur, I can say that these are some of the best I have had and the Loaded Fries with chili and cheese are the stuff dreams are made of.  The burgers have been perfectly cooked both times as well and the topping choices are terrific!  The service is on point and the atmosphere is fun.  A definite new favorite!"}
{"text":"I don't see what all the fuss is about with this place.  Yes, they do have a lot of free toppings, but that doesn't exactly make it good.  The boyfriend got a burger with cheddar-jack, guacamole, bacon, lettuce, and onions.  It didn't look all too appetizing, and we've had way tastier burgers.  I got a grilled cheese with  cheddar and pepper jack, and topped with onions and artichoke hearts.  The cheese wasn't even melted.  It was like they buttered two piece of bread and then sandwiched the cheese and toppings, put it on a plate, and then served it.  It was disappointing because how do you screw up a grilled cheese?  The onion rings were awesome!!  They were lightly battered and thin.  They were pretty much all I ate there.  Their fries were alright, nothing to rave about.    I probably will not be coming back, even if the onion rings were delish.  I'd much rather go to In-N-Out or Smashburger."}
{"text":"Continuing my quest to find a great burger in Montreal, I had to schedule a stop at Cheeburger Cheeburger.  Unfortunately, the quest will not end today.  Retro 50's style decor is OK. The menu was well translated, considering this Montreal location is Cheeburger's one and only Canadian restaurant. Gotta be happy about that.  Service was friendly but could've been more attentive, especially since most of the waitstaff were taking smoke breaks every 15mins outside.. and the place was almost empty.  Two major problems with this place:  1- The Burgers 2- The Price  What a disappointment.  My only reason for going there was to finally try a burger cooked \"medium\" ,not those dry, hard burgers we are so used to in this city. So I was very happy to order \"The Serious\" burger, cooked medium.  What I got was a burger with a 90-10% dark to pink meat ratio. Which is not \"medium\". The burger was bland, not juicy and was lacking big time flavor. We got the mix basket of fries and onion rings. They were thin and crispy, with very good flavor, not too salty.  We finished the basket and wished we had ordered a bigger size, so for two, I would recommend going with the full portion not the half.  I agree that the selection of toppings and cheeses you can put on the burger is great, but what I want to taste is the meat!!!!!  So for 2 burgers, fries and drink, expect to pay at least 40$+tx+tip. This is outrageous. Period. We left the restaurant feeling completely ripped off.   Five Guys is a much better option. Trust me."}
{"text":"i like this burger place, but to me they need to have a thicker ( or stronger ) hamburger bun.. After all the toppings are added, the bread gets soggy and it becomes very dificult to eat. Altough a little too liquid, their milkshakes are good"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lumch with a couple friends and the place was super busy we almost left. Didn't wait as long as I thought we would to get a table. The server wasn't very friendly but the manager came out to our table,I think her name was Stephanie and she was the best. She recommended a burger and some kind of berry milkshake. couldn't have been better. Good service is hard to find these days and the manager was on point. I can see why the place was packed. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"If u like to customize burgers like i do, but feel a little ripped off at places like the burger bar, i would totally recommend cheeburger cheeburger! They have a ton of topping options for your burger and different patty options as well. They also have a pretty impressive array of flavors for milkshakes as well. The large is perfect to share, and i'd highly recommend the pineapple flavor. It has pineapple chunks in it. Mmm, dang it! Now i want to go there. The prices are way better than comparable restaurants and are a reasonable option all on its own. It great for groups with picky or restricted eaters. Just go dangit!"}
{"text":"I been here about 8-9 times already and I feel like the quality is different every time every visit varies if their busy or not , usually when their busy my food isn't at the same quality as when it is slow   Overall I love the food and selection of milk shakes"}
{"text":"Cheeburger Cheeburger: So many choices, so little time, but so much fun.   Enter the 50s themed diner to choose your burger size, up to a full pound, at reasonable prices.  All burger toppings are free, so mix and match to your stomach's content.  I went for the spiciness of jalapenos covered with the coolness of cole slaw, for a sloppy good burger.  If a big sloppy burger is not enough, add a basket of fries and onion rings with up to 5 dipping sauces to keep your fingers busy.  And there are too many milkshake flavors to comprehend.  You can even mix flavors, creating up to a ridiculous 378,000 flavors or something.  I decided on a nice Blueberry Pie shake to act as dessert.  Be sure to stop by and discover your own creation. With all these choices, you won't get bored."}
{"text":"The worst burger I tasted in my life. The color of the meat was strange brown not what a regular grounded meat should look like. The frys were really dark brown. It looked like they used te same oil for the past few months.  The drink was served in a tiny glass bottle and costed $2.50. My wife and I spent close to $30 for 2 hamburgers,fries and 1 small coke plus tip. The price is one thing but the food is the worst."}
{"text":"$50 for 2 adults, 1 child  I'll start with the good.  The service is very friendly and attentive, especially for a burger joint.  This place would be a notch above a fast food burger joint and a notch below an Applebees type restaurant, as far service and ambiance goes.  Our 6 year old enjoyed the decor and was immediately greeted with some crayons and a coloring/activity piece of paper. Our server (yes they have actual servers here) came over promptly to ask about apps and drinks.  She was friendly and patient throughout our dinner and offered suggestions.  Ok, the other side.  50 bucks for a family of 3 at a burger joint is ridiculous.  RIDICULOUS.  A soft drink cost $2.69 + tax. The burgers go for $7-$12 to start, and then cheese is 50 cents, and there are many free toppings to choose from and a handful of additional costs toppings.  So you're really looking at $9-$15 and up for a burger.  That's a lot of money for a casual burger joint.    So my burger.... I ordered it medium and it was cooked properly.  I asked for garlic and S&P seasonings.  I couldn't taste the seasonings at all.  You really need some type of salt on burger meat to bring out the fat and flavor.  The sauce I added was a dab in the middle of the bun, not spread on the bun.  So the first few bites have no sauce, then you suddenly get too much at once.  The beef had a decent flavor, but without the salt, it wasn't memorable.  Over all, it wasn't a bad burger, but definitely not the asking price.  The other burger we ordered had sauteed shrooms and onions and it was pretty good.   I think the overall turn off is the high price for this meal.  I honestly feel it was worth half that, at most.  I hope they improve on the preparation and prices."}
{"text":"There have been many times when I knew right away that I was in love with a burger, but rarely have I disliked one instantly. That is until now of course, in the case of Cheeburger Cheeburger. I actually stated \"I hate this bun\" as soon as I swallowed my first bite, and it only went downhill from there. Read on if you dare.  There are apparently many locations all over the country of this place, although I can't say it's really been on my radar aside from a few recommendations through friends in town. And after my experience, I'm not sure if I would consider these folks my friends... the interior is kind of like a stand-alone Johnny Rockets; 50's diner style right down to the cheesy neon and stainless steel on the walls. It's extremely gimmicky, and much worse than any Fatburger I've ever been near. It wasn't overly crowded the night I was there for dinner, but there were several families and it really confused me as to how this place is popular.  The menu offers burgers ranging from 1lb down to a 5.5 ounce 'beginner', along with chicken sandwiches, wraps, salads and the option of supposedly over 1,285,000 combinations of shakes. They offer some odd toppings such as peanut butter, pepperoni and salsa. I guess there are options for anyone looking to create a disgusting burger.  I was excited to see Heinz 57 sauce as an option, and mistakenly ordered it on my burger along with mushrooms, lettuce and tomato. As I said, upon first bite the bun turned me off; it was incredibly dry, had no flavor, and was way too thick and large for the sandwich. It was grilled and buttered on the inside, but that little bit of flavor couldn't compete with the vacuum of flavor created by the dryness. The meat was actually cooked quite well and had decent flavor, but the person I was eating with didn't have as much luck so I question their consistency and must assume I was lucky for now. My mushrooms had ok flavor but the small amount I was given got lost in the other flavors. And by other flavors I really just mean my Heinz 57 sauce, which completely took over the entire burger with its semi-BBQ flavor. I always thought I liked that sauce, but apparently not on burgers. I also must note that I only ordered the 1/3lb burger which I can easily handle, but this was so bad I only finished a little more than half.  The one positive factor of this meal was that because of my Foursquare check-in we were given a free order of small  1/2 fries and  1/2 onion rings. Both of them were ok; the fries were crispy and had decent flavor other than the couple of really undercooked ones that snuck in our basket. The onion rings were the thin, greasy, crispy battered type which I love, as opposed to the thick-breaded, hard to bite through variety. They were good, although I'm just not a huge fan of onion rings. They offer a few different dipping sauces; we went with the Zesty Horseradish sauce which was ok I guess.  By the time we were done with our meal we were completely dissatisfied and turned off by everything. We almost got mad that there were so many families and other people seemingly enjoying what they were eating. The only tasty parts of our meal were the Oreo and Peanut Butter Cup shakes we got, and that's not something I typically order. With the free fries and onion rings our meal cost $25.20, it would have been over $30 if those weren't free. This price does include $7.98 for two shakes, but is a bit too much for how unhappy we were. $6.99 for a burger isn't a bad price, especially off the strip, but what I was given I wouldn't pay for again. I'm not even going to sugarcoat it, just avoid this place."}
{"text":"I came here twice the first time the burgers were great and the milkshakes were to die for. So went again and the 2nd time was not so great the milkshakes were runny and they left out the bacon and cheese on my burger so I will try again maybe i caught them on an off night?"}
{"text":"This is a throwback to an old school burger joint.  Prices are on the high side for a not so gourmet burger and the service was lacking.  Went once a four years ago and tried it again recently.  I probably will not be going back again."}
{"text":"My family loves the fried pickles with ranch and onion rings with horseradish dip. Everything was cooked perfectly and it was piping hot! My husband ordered an enormous one pound burger well and I got the semi-serious medium. The cook timed everything perfectly.  Try a cherry soda....YUM! Clean restrooms too."}
{"text":"I, like many Americans, come from a cheeseburger family. We don't eat pizza that often. So a fancy cheeseburger restaurant with a retro feel is right up my alley. I'd take my grandfather here if he didn't commit suicide by refusing to take his blood pressure medicine for a month, resulting in a stroke. Because he would have loved it. He would have told me stories about how Hank Williams would have to hand Elvis Presley a gun if they ever fought just so that Elvis could even stand a chance at beating him. He really loved Hank WIlliams, thought Johnny Cash was too much of a prissy though.  But I digress, I love getting to live out an A1 steaksauce commercial from the 2000s. Steaksauce, on a burgerrr? Yes, it's that important. Fried pickles, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, and even more deep fried goodies are usually ordered instead of fries too. So I'm straight ballin' when I come here. It's all good. Put some relish n musta on it, it ain't extra."}
{"text":"I've been really wanting to try this place ever since I missed out on the UYE 1 pound burger challenge. This place tries to have a fun 50's diner vibe like Johnny Rocket's or Ruby's Diner. However unlike those 2 places, it has this garish pink neon lighting which detracted from the atmosphere. I didn't have very high expectations for this place, but my experience still fell far short. My friend and I each ordered a Cheeplatter for $12.99 which consisted of a 1/2 pound Black Angus burger with your choice of fixings, fries or onion rings, house salad or coleslaw, choice of dipping sauce, no drink included. As a portent of things to come, the salad was unappetizing and consisted of far too much shredded cheese and hard croutons and too little greens. I had asked for the burger to be cooked medium and got something between rare and medium rare and served lukewarm. The fries were also lukewarm and soggy. My friend had chosen coleslaw instead of the salad and received 2 tiny plastic condiment containers worth. He normally loves coleslaw but did not find it worth eating. The service while friendly was on the slow side when it came to water refills. From reading the other reviews, maybe I came on an off night. Sadly I may never know because I don't see a reason to subject myself to their food ever again. Next time I have a burger craving, you'll find me at In-N-Out or Smashburger, or even BK or McD's."}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere. Great fries and onion rings. The burgers need a little more....something (I think seasoning would be the word) but they let you put so many toppings on that it hardly matters.   Great place for a quick summer milkshake or to take your family!"}
{"text":"This is a American style diner, or at least it tried to be. Unfortunately the meat did not have any taste which is weird because they provide you with their own seasoning at the table (I wish they would have put the seasoning in the meat) You are given many options for toppings but they don't put much. The cheese wasn't even melted. They say the burger takes 15 minutes but it took a little less than 10 minutes which makes me think it's more of a fast food joint than a sit down restaurant.  The fries were also disappointing since they were soggy and tasteless.  I was ready to give this place 3 stars but the thing that ruined it for me was that the soap in the bathroom was watered down!! Why would anyone do that?! I mean do you really save that much from the soap?! Overall the experience was disappointing since I had seen many good reviews on yelp. I want to say that my bad experience was due to a one time error but it's gonna be hard to come back here again, especially because the price is a little too high."}
{"text":"Fatburger is better than this place. The fries were burnt and old soggy and the patty was bland."}
{"text":"After my initial review where I complained that we were not even given water or greeted by a waiter for 10 minutes, the owner apologized and offered to send me a gift card to give his restaurant another chance.  I gave him my address; I never received the card.   So much for giving this place a second chance!  There are lots of other burger places in Henderson vying for business."}
{"text":"Maybe my wife & I had the one in a million bad experience. We walked in around 3:00 pm Sunday afternoon. The restaurant was mostly empty and our server took our order quickly. My wife & I each ordered the 7 ounce burger, fries, & Pepsi. There are signs posted in the restaurant saying good things comes to those that wait, and we sure did wait! I understand food cooked to order & I don't mind waiting for good food, but this was anything but. The burger itself was average at best and not very hot. The meat was bland, unseasoned, & dry. Both burgers were ordered with cheddar cheese and both burgers were served without cheese of any kind. The french fries were dark brown & cold. They were overcooked and tasted as though they had been sitting for some time. Our server, who disappeared, never came back to ask how the food was or if we needed anything. We flagged down another waitress to have the table cleared & to get our check. That waitress didn't ask about the two servings of uneaten fries or if she could get us anything else. After 10 minutes, I had to go to the register to get our check. The manager took our payment without asking how our meal was. Overall, this place was a $28.78 disappointment, and we won't be going back!"}
{"text":"The burger was awesome!! I like the way they give you a ton of topics and you can customize it. Oh and the shakes are amazing."}
{"text":"Went there w/a coupon card I received in the mail FROM THEM.  It said come in for a FREE CHEESEBURGER & BRING A FRIEND.  The two of us went & my friend was gonna buy a burger.  Showed the card & lady at counter said, \"Wait, I have to get my manager\".  She was back at the counter in 15 sec. & said, \"My manager said card expired\"!  There was NO EXPIRATION DATE on the card!  We walked out & will NEVER go back!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to try this place today cause It was new (despite the bad reviews from other people) we gave it a shot. When we were seated, the hostess was extremely nice and explained the menu very well to us so 5 stars for her! Buuuttttt... Our waitress didn't get to our table for at least 15 minutes with no drinks or anything.. By the time she finally got to the table, she didn't ask us how we were doing, or even being remotely nice about her job. She took our food orders, and we had to speak up about getting our drinks. We told her we wanted water and coke, well another 10 minutes goes by and she hasn't even gotten our drinks or put our orders into the computer yet... A different server came to our table and says \"so sorry, the other server is busy and flustered so I'll take your orders now\" we were extremely upset to find out we didn't even get our food put into the computer systems the first time and we still haven't gotten our drinks... Not to mention the place was practically dead, maybe 3 or 4 tables... At this point we told the lady to cancel our orders and we proceeded to leave... Horrible service, NEVER going there again.."}
{"text":"Great burgers great fries and great cheese.    This place returns you to the 60's dinners.  It's like going back in time.  The waitress are awesome and fast.   They have a awesome shake-a-soda where they make the soda right in front of you.  The prices are a little high and is why the 4 stars.    The hamburgers are awesome and you get to pick your toppings."}
{"text":"Jamed is an amazing manager! Thank you for the wonderful time at this store. Take the pounder challenge if you dare! Amazing burger better than red robin, McDonald's, burger king, etc. Trust me I've had many burgers in my lifetime."}
{"text":"I see many hypercritical reviews on this store. It's not bad at all!! Food is great and the employees are quick to assist. Leave it to a few people to complicate and moan about why they didn't specify what they wanted on their order... Go see for yourself, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My wife and grand children were looking for a place to eat on our way home to New Hampshire. We stumbled upon cheeburger cheeburger. We decided to give it a try because I remembered the SNL skits. We believe that these cheeburgers were the best we have ever eaten. The onion rings were excellent as well. We were also very pleased with the friendliness of the service. We would definately stop there again and would recommend Cheeburger to anyone looking for a great meal. It is not inexpensive but well worth it."}
{"text":"I had a burnt burger couple weeks ago and I posted what I thought about it. They responded and they invited me to go back. They are doing the right to correct the issue.. kudos to them.. that's the way it should be is to care what they serve.."}
{"text":"Never again. First time there, Terrible service we waited 45 minutes for our food and they weren't even busy. Definitely a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Easily one of the better burger places here in the city. The burgers are nothing short of delicious and the amount of toppings is just mindblowing. The french fries and onion rings are great, but the dipping sauces could be better. The milkshakes are wonderful and are a wonderful dessert.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ok...So here's the deal. You know a place is bad when I feel compelled to share my bad experience with the world.  I feel horrible doing this, but I mean come on! Not only was the food some of the worst I've ever had (and I have had really bad food).  But what got me more then the horrible food, was the service.  I sat outside for 15 minutes before I went in to get someone, Than It took another 10 for her to come out.  All the while I had a server that was sitting down talking to a table.  The food was cold, service was slow, and it was not worth the money.  I vow to never go there again! There are so many other great places at Tempe Market Place."}
{"text":"The burgers were good but the onion rings and dipping sauce was very good lightly battered golden brown. The service was great too."}
{"text":"This place rules!! Well, except for the fact that they serve that inferior Cola product here that starts with a P.   Anyways...first time here & I absolutely dug it! I opted for the Semi-Serious, since I was wanting a shake as well ;) The free toppings are awesome! However, I wish they had green chile though :(   I had pineapple, banana peppers, teriyaki & pickles on my burger & cooked medium, which was actually cooked nicely, with hardly any pink at all. I also ordered a Mounds shake with butterscotch, OMFG! Freakin' fantastic! Also had a side of frings :P Lol, that's what Jack in the Box used to call them back in the day, when they used to serve fries & onion rings together. Very tasty & I dug the seasoning as well.   I'm definitely going to keep coming back & eventually, I'm gonna do the pounder challenge as well ;)"}
{"text":"If you want something a little different, or just something you recognize, go to Cheeburger Cheeburger.   I have been there a few times, and I love it. it is your average 50's motif burger joint, with a twist. There are 5 different sizes from the Classic at 5.5 ounces to the Pounder at a whopping 20 ounces before cooking. Now you get to choose your Cheese from a choice of 8 cheeses (there are no hamburgers on the menu, however the cook will gladly forgo the cheese if you want). That is only the beginning, you can choose between 29 different toppings and just for a little more you can add another 5 toppings. I am not sure how many different combinations you can make; however, the fun is experimenting to see just what you can come up with and try as many different combinations as you can. When you finish the Pounder, you get your picture taken and placed on the wall, or in a little book they will show you of different people who came with a Cheeburger Cheeburger appetite.  And that is just the beginning. You need to experience Cheeburger Cheeburger on your own. So when you are in Las Vegas just follow Rainbow Blvd south, and it will be on your left, you have to look out for it, because you can miss it (and that would be a sad experience).  I forgot to mention Milkshakes and Malts, there are 378,000 different combinations, I think I want to try them all."}
{"text":"This place is expensive for what you get and very average overall.  You pay for the 50's theme and decor, but they didn't even spring for booths, just cheap and uncomfortable tables.  We got turkey burgers that were fair at best.  Sweet potato fries were tasteless, the chocolate malt tasted like it was made with that super cheap chocolate ice cream.  Our bill topped 40 bucks with tip for two adults and two little kids that split one kids meal.  We went to Carls Jr and got pretty much the same meal with superior quality and taste for about 17 bucks. Of course, no cool decor, so the experience wasn't quite as fun, but I think there are MANY better burger joints in Vegas than this one..."}
{"text":"It's good... But over priced. Small fries is composed to 8 fries.. Disorganized and food takes forever. Next time I'll go to Five Guys up the road .."}
{"text":"Got seated right away, and should have as there was only one other couple. The place is cute but seems kinda dirty maybe it's just the colors. The place smells like nail polish remover and was hot.   Not impressed with the burgers at all but service was pretty goos"}
{"text":"Burgers done the way you want...LITERALLY! And some of the best milkshakes in town with thousands of variations."}
{"text":"Cheeburger Cheeburger has always been a seeet spot for me. The service is always great when I go there. The servers are always attentive of our needs. This is a great spot to get down to business with your creation of a burger. They do have some chicken items on the menu but creating your burger is the way to go! The milkshakes are on point too. If you want a place where you'll be treated great as a customer. To also have your burger made the way you want it. Sweet potato fries with a side of marshmellow. Then you'll love this place."}
{"text":"I had been told about this location by my daughter and son-in-law as awesome food.  So my daughter, who is recovering from surgery placed the order online.  She received her email verification at 2:16 pm with a pickup time of 2:46 pm.  I arrived a couple of minutes before scheduled pick up time and was told that they just received our order and it would take 12 minutes.  I explained that it was ordered at approximately 2:20 (gave them a few minutes leeway) and that they may want to check their online ordering system since it was reporting erroneous times.  I unfortunately left my daughters phone at home with the confirmation email (which I would recommend anyone who does order online), so I could not show them since they seemed a little agitated that I questioned their system.  I WILL NEVER go there again.  This order was placed not during lunch rush, and there were only 6 tables occupied when I arrived and 4 of them had their food already.  Not sure what the problem with there personnel  making the system work efficiently, but besides my daughter  and son-in-law, I will give others my feelings here in Henderson and I shall take my future business to Five Guys.  At least I have never had a problem with online ordering with them."}
{"text":"Not sure where to start...the absolutely awesome pure beef patties, amazing thick strawberry shake, massive amount of toppings, or the great services. No matter what this place rocks. I started with the 10oz burger with about half dozen toppings, I wasn't sure if I could move up so I stayed again with the 10oz but will be going to the 14oz, 20oz, and eventually hit the TWO POUNDER. This place has the best burgers in town set back in a 50's style environment it's a must eat for sure. I get the medium which is perfect with a little pink in the center and ooohhh somewhat a mess but that's probably why they give you a fork and knife (which I never use). This is a fun place to eat and you won't leave hungry but if you do just remember to order a bigger burger on your next trip."}
{"text":"The burger was average the toppings sparse. Service was average. Milkshake was below average."}
{"text":"I've been talkin' this place up to my pop for about a month or so & last night I finally got him in there... they did not disappoint... I had a serious piled high with goodies... my dad had a patty melt that he raved about the whole time he was devouring it.... unfortunately we couldn't partake in creating a super awesome milk shake.... anyone who's been will tell you it's mind boggling trying to decide what flavors to put together for that perfect shake....                         The food rocks the lol skool dinner feel dig on this place big time  go once & you'll be back again & again"}
{"text":"A burger-building 50's joint? Attached to an upscale mall? In Montreal?!  Yeah, consider me surprised too.  The basic gist with this place is that you're ordering a Cheeseburger. Sure, there are various exceptions, but that's what they will assume out of the gate. You pick how big you want to be (from regular human to \"I challenge you!\", effectively) and load it up with whatever toppings float your boat. Onion rings and pepperoni? Sure, why not? Fries and/or poutine are ordered seperately.  (The expensive toppings (bacon, eggs, etc.) are extra, like every other burger joint in Montreal.)  I'll give the staff a pass. Sure, they seem hamstrung by 10 year old ordering devices. And yes, they still managed to not give me the exact burger I ordered. But they were friendly, responsive, and more than a little rushed.  The real achilles heel of Cheeburger? It's the bun. It tastes great, but collapses under the moisture of its toppings. Eating a \"Cheeburger\" is a fight against time, as wet vegetables and sauces turn your bun into a disintegrating puck.  After less than a minute my burger was dripping out entire toppings to the plate. They seem to recognize this, endowing each table with a paper-towel roll, but I'm fairly certain I'll attack next time with a fork and not my hands.  That's right - next time. There's nothing about the bun that can distract from the fact that Cheeburger makes a really good burger. Drop a few of the wet veggies, and maybe it's a top three burger in Montreal. That's worth a shot, right?"}
{"text":"Great burgers and toppings! The shakes are tasty and the chili fries are to die for! Try it out!"}
{"text":"Where to begin? The decor is terrible, just terrible. It feels like a revamped version of Nickel's, so much so I am curious as to whether Celine Dion holds shares in the franchise or not. The service? What service? You will be served when you are served and they may or may not come back to see if you need anything, it seems to be hit and miss with the service.  Now, to the food, oh God, the food. It's bad. The onion rings are generic and taste like Mc'Cains onion rings that you can fry up at home. The burgers are rock hard! I know that burgers have to be well done (it's against the law to serve a hamburger at any other temperature but well done in Quebec) but they've taken it to a whole new level. It's not 'done' it's overly done and dry. One of the worst burgers I've ever had, ever.   The prices are much too high versus the quality of the food served.  They need to concentrate more on the beef patties and less on all of the fru-fru stuff they put on it.   You can rest assured that you will not catch a case of E-coli poisoning visiting Cheeburger-Cheeburger in Montreal, but, your're not going to have a good meal either."}
{"text":"I have been to this establishment in the past and have had a good experience. The burgers are great and the shakes are wonderful. It was just last night that I decided to take my family of four and two guests with us for dinner. The two additional guests were only ordering milkshakes and the family ordered dinner.  The reason for the star rating is not due to the food but what the server decided to do with the bill. You see there was six of us and they decided to include my 2 year old and my 10 month old as members of the party. They included the gratuity on the bill due to the size of the party. This disgusts me, they should not include a 10 month old as a member of the party. If they thought that they would be guaranteed some sort of tip good for them! I was able to save some money due to the tip being included and didn't feel bad for not tipping more after being a part of this greedy scenario.  This happened to us at another establishment and we have never returned!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent service was super no complaints. I will be back. Great job. Our patty melts were very tasty and made the way we asked for. We were seated and waited on in less than 5 minutes food came out hot and in less the 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Great burgers and desserts, but the fries were not that good.  You get your photo on the wall if you can eat a big burger.  I got mine up there."}
{"text":"I recently went back with my wife and a friend for dinner before a movie. The food was still good and the service was much better than what I experienced last time.   I think the burgers are well done and you get your choice of various sides (as many as you want). A few sides cost extra or if you want another slice of cheese. The fries or sweet potato fries are above average.  The waiter refilled our water and drinks and gave the check to us in a timely manner. This didn't happen during my previous experience.  My wife and I split an Oreo and Marshmallow  shake. The shake was superb! I think we both regretted splitting the shake instead of getting our own. For shake lovers, there is a huge variety of flavors and selections to choose from.  I've raised my rating to a 4 now with the service improvement.  I still need to take the 1 lb burger challenge."}
{"text":"Came here one evening with friends to pick up some burgers and fries and head back to Khoury's for beer and board games (I lurve Khoury's like Celine Dion lurves saying lurve).  The burger itself lacked any real bang (cheddar, bacon, and Chipotle mayo, but they forgot the mayo) and was a bit bland. On the positive side, the fries were quite good and the staff was friendly.  My three friends that joined me enjoyed their meals, however, so maybe I'm just a big ol' Ms. Prissy Pants when burgering!  Honestly, can't take me anywhere."}
{"text":"Okay, to start let's just say it's basically a malt shop.  Burgers, shakes, sodas mixed to order, even egg creams for all you Brooklinites.  They're big on two things here; limitless opportunities to customize your shake and burger and massive, bronto-rib-steak sized servings.  The half order of fries can feed 3 easily.  Their smallest burger is a quarter pounder (and that's cooked weight, not raw weight) and they go all the way up to one pounders (a ridiculous 20 ounces raw weight).  Most custom toppings are complimentary, but bacon, sauteed onions or mushrooms will cost you extra.  The food takes a while.  Is it worth it?  Well, if you like malt shops, sure.  I guess it is. The food is pretty much what you'd expect, if slightly mega-sized.  And the shakes and egg creams are good.  Certainly worth a try if your nostalgic or you can't remember a place outside of the old neighborhood where you can get an egg cream."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Mediocre food. Waited 30 minutes after eating to get our check. Also, witnessed a patron waiting on a to-go order start bussing the tables since the staff wasn't. Not sure we'll be back. There was one attentive waitress that helped our experience and bumped up the rating to 2 stars."}
{"text":"On my second time coming here my burger was still bland tasting. The service was awful. Our waitress had about as much personality as a wet blanket. We had just barely finished our meal when it seemed as if they were already trying to rush us out the door. If you want to make money in this day and age just provide great service don't worry about turning over tables."}
{"text":"Disclaimer:  The only reason I'm giving this place a 4/5 is because of the staff and the restaurant itself.  The food itself gets a 3/5.  The interior of the restaurant is awesome!  It's completely decked out in 50's decor such as pink walls, neon signs, classic car pictures, Elvis posters etc. 5/5  The host and waitress were EXTREMELY nice.  They educated us on the extensive menu very quickly, joked around with us, and frequently checked on us to make sure were were okay. 5/5.  The food.  Okay, first off, the menu is EXTENSIVE.  They have wayyy too many options on the menu.  I get it, they have 25 free toppings, however, when the waitress has to ask 5+ questions to each person when ordering, it really bring the enjoyment down.  Second,  the new wings they have, eh they were okay.  Third, The burger I built was okay, honestly nothing special.  I had high hopes for this place but was somewhat disappointed.  I will be back for the feel of the diner and the awesome servers and perhaps next time I'll try something else."}
{"text":"Lots of choices met us when we walked into Cheeburger Cheeburger. On the hamburger menu there's about 10 different cheeses and 15 toppings. They have a huge Italian syrup bar and they'll add a mix to any soda or iced tea.  The food was good, but unless you live in south Chandler, I wouldn't make the drive if you have a favorite in your neighborhood."}
{"text":"Cheeburger Cheeburger is a retro cheeseburger place where you can get juicy burgers and delicious shakes. The decor is very retro, think 50s diner, and it fits the menu very well. For your burger, you pick the size and cheese, then you can fill it up with as many toppings as you'd like. The shakes are a treat, and you get whatever didn't fit in your glass on the side for later. The price is very good considering how much food you get, and they sell their sauces and seasoning for you to enjoy their taste at home. I highly recommend it for anyone with an appetite or just a non-fast food burger.  P.S. If you manage to eat their famous One Pounder cheeseburger, you get immortalized on their board as you walk in. Do you have it in you?"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the food or the service.  First we were there for 1 hr 40 minutes for a burger, not fine dining. It was not totally the waitress's fault , she did have some lapses ,but  I think it had to do with staffing mostly.                        I don' remember the name of my burger I think it was 1/2 lb, I order my burgers med /well , it was a little burnt on one side. The fillings are generous but the buns do not hold up well , I had to use a knife and fork on mine. The fries and onion rings were alright.  I also had the s'mores shake nothing special ,I can buy s'mores ice cream and blend it up myself. Nothing stood out , except the long wait..."}
{"text":"The 10 oz burger had no taste it was totally bland. Without the toppings it was not eatable. Unfortunately, the fries were cold, soggy and tasteless. Lack of management supervision. Server tried very hard, but should have rejected the fries. Too much competition to allow this place to continue to operate."}
{"text":"Very slow service.  Waited an hour for shakes, then when we got them they where melted and one didn't have anything we ordered in it. Had them redo them. Still waiting on our food. Shouldn't ever take over an hour to get food this is crazy."}
{"text":"The food was good be service was very slow. We ordered a shake waited 15 mins before we learned the main ingredient was out of stock. Our food made it to the table still no shake since we changed the shake order. A table was sat near us was never greeted got tired of waiting they left without eating at all. At the end we sat just waiting to pay so we could leave over all not a good experience may not go back."}
{"text":"let me tell you. this is the best burger in town. I actually went on accident and the dinning area looked very cool. we sat down and ordered and from start to finish it was amazing. great service great burgers. also don't even get me started on the fried onion rings and milkshakes. heaven."}
{"text":"My wife, kids and I just went. My wife stated that we probably won't go again but did give it 4 stars.  I give it five stars and we will deffinately be going again."}
{"text":"Great banana split!  Alex is fantabulous!!! I went for family night out.  We had no left overs."}
{"text":"I was there last night with some friends and we had a great time and enjoyed the burgers & shakes and all of the various options available. The girls were friendly and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Our experience to Cheeburger was sadly disappointing. My boyfriend and I drove past it while looking for something to eat at 8:30pm and stopped in to try it. We were unaware that it was closing at 9, but the staff proceeded to seat us and not inform us on the closing time. While we were waiting, we checked the hours online and realized it was already closed, and apologized to the staff and decided to take the food home. Upon eating the food, we discovered the fries tasted dry and like they were made from earlier in the day. Our burgers were also burned on the outside but rare on the inside. We felt like this was intentional, which is an extremely disappointing experience on the staffs end and also disappointing in the fact that they lost customers that will tell their friends to never visit this establishment for that reason."}
{"text":"Great burgers, suberb shakes.  Staff are all extremely nice.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, great shakes and good burgers. The assortment of shakes and burger toppings is enormous. Fries were good and the onion rings, so-so."}
{"text":"Went again even though I had a less the appealing first experience. Service was better but my burger was still bland as were the onion rings and French fries. Even more friend who isn't a picky eater that went me this time said it wasn't worth it and we should have went to McDonald's."}
{"text":"Great burger place . Staff was friendly our waiter took the time to explain the menu. Tons of options for burger toppings. Fried artichoke hearts to die for . Will be going back ."}
{"text":"This place is amazing with a retro dinner decor, food is very delicious, taste like fat burger but better because the price doesn't hit you hard in your wallet. A-1 Everythang!"}
{"text":"Local Vegas news had a segment on the new location at Eastern  and Ione went there on the 17th of April 6:30 pm, ordered  a banana split with some water so far so good, banana split came took a few bites notice no bananas told our server bananas  were missing she told us that since we took some bites out of it all she could do was to bring some bananas in a side dish not happy but ok, she came back with One old sliced banana and said sorry worst  banana split ever, one star just because."}
{"text":"I gave this place a couple tries because I was really interested in the concept and the menu options looked awesome. On my last visit there was a lot left to be desired both service and product. The burger was sloppy with very little flavor, fries were Luke warm when I received them, appetizer sampler was mostly pickles and mushroom pieces and the shake was supposed to be flavored with white chocolate and key lime, but it was plain vanilla and milk.   Each time I ordered takeout from this location items were prepared incorrectly or forgotten. I love a good cheeseburger, but each time I have ordered from here I have been uninterested after a bit or two. For the price....sit down restaurant prices for oversized meals with undesirable flavor.   I did not want to be so critical of this joint because the look and feel of the concept seemed like such a winner, but a drive through value menu at any fast food restaurant would leave me more satisfied and with less regret."}
{"text":"Burgers a great and toppings are numerous! Sides are great- no complaints here!  Friendly staff as well!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were so excited to try this place. I have a gluten allergy and we saw on their main site that a gluten free bun was available. To make sure, I called before and was told yes, they have gf bun. When we got there we liked the 50's upbeat atmosphere and friendly employees. I mentioned that I wanted GF bun and was told they did not have it! UGH! SO my wife ordered her burger and I ordered mine without any bun and took it to go. We got home to find our orders completely reversed...complete incompetence! The employees were friendly, but they had that blank look on their face when asked questions about their product. Unacceptable! At this moment my wife is driving back to get the order corrected. It will be the last time we take our business there. Too many other options especially at that price!"}
{"text":"Great bun, great meat, great fries (my fav are the sweet potato fries) great concept.  Just make sure to check your bill before you pay, they mess up the charges alot.  Mon-Fri lunch and dinner special. Check in on 4 square and get a free basket of 1/2 onion rings, 1/2 fries. Coupons in the entertainment book."}
{"text":"This is a good option for a quick bite, couple of steps up from your regular fast food restaurant. You can select the size and toppings (good selection). The fries and onion rings are average. If you are into old school milk shakes they have a vast selection of flavors and you can create your own combination. The place is clean and large so I can't imagine someone will have problems finding a table. It is great for kids and large families. The staff is very friendly. Prices are fair. Parking is also not a problem neither. So, as I said, this is a great option for a quick bite if you are not in the mood for one of the traditional fast food places, but you can get better (gourmet) burgers somewhere else in town. Ohh no alcohol beverages, so if you like to enjoy a burger with a beer..well not your place. I didn't try the deserts, but I enjoyed a nice strawberry/hershey's chocolate milkshake."}
{"text":"Worst burger in Vegas...  Probably the worst burger anywhere.    My wife and I walked in one night around 7:30 and there was not a single person in the place...  we should have walked out.  Well, I really wanted a burger, so we ordered.  The kids working there seemed more interested in playing around than cooking our food.  After about 25 minutes we finally got our food.  We made the 3 minute drive home and were so disappointed.  Bottom line, the burger was undercooked and the meat smelled horrible, the frys were soggy with rancid smelling oil dripping off of them, and even the soda was bad (no carbonation).  My wife stopped after 1 bite and I struggled through 2 or 3 bites.  I will never go back to this place...  they will never get a second chance to make a first impression (on my wife and I, at least).    P.S. - My original review was removed by Yelp because somebody (most likely the owners of this awful place) \"flagged\" my review."}
{"text":"Great burger.  A little $$. Loved the music. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable prices and had a great staff, especially our waitress!!!!  Think I'd go back a lot more often"}
{"text":"I feel like it should be more popular.  What can I say: 1. Juicy burger w/ any cheese you want 2. Hand crafted shakes w/ real ice cream 3. Thin crispy fries (I like fries crispy)  Here's the rub, the food listed above is pushing 2000 calories, I'm 30 now and I live in Scottsdale, where I feel like everyone is fit or at least fairly thin. So my vanity keeps me out of there.  That aside, don't let the funny name keep you from stopping in, it's some good stuff."}
{"text":"Very good service and friendly staff!   The food is pretty good too. Reminds me of a 50's diner. The selection of toppings for the burgers are great and several different portion options.  I'll be back here again."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! My husband and I went for lunch and were surprised how quiet it was .. Only two tables were occupied. I liked how they had different sizes to choose from( I had a semi serious he had a serious. 1/3 and 1/2 lbs. ) we also ordered a small combo of onion rings and fries. They were just the right amount to share. Loved the onion rings. Thin cut and lightly battered and so crispy ! The fries were natural cut skin on just the way  I like them. Burgers were juicy although quite messy( they have like 50 toppings to choose from)   Wanted to try their shakes ( they have so many flavors and over hundreds of thousands of different combinations but was too stuffed. Will have to wait till next time. All in all was pleased and would definitely try again."}
{"text":"A second visit in the last 2 weeks. I enjoyed the 1/2 lb burger so muc! I was disappointed to say the least.  I ordered the 1/2 lb Cheeseburger on Kaiser roll and was happy she asked me how I wanted the burger cooked. Medium, Medium Well and Well were the options. Actually, I would've liked it Medium Rare, but that bus left the Inspection station years ago. Also asked for small order of onion rings. All written down and I was 'all set'   After awhile, the waitress brought my requested water and I waited another 10 minutes before a different waitress brought my burger and slid off.  Wait...no juices seen and lifting the top bun showed a dry hockey puck with no cheese. I was bone dry. Took a bite, hoping for a surprise and got none. It was well done, dry and tasteless. Cheese would not have helped.  No onion rings as they weren't ready yet. They arrived later. Thin rings, very greasy. Another disappointment.   The waitress came to clear the table and saw my two bites gone and I told her the burger was terrible and why. I explained my last visit was so good and this was a disappointment.   The check arrived arrived with $1.30 taken off for l'oyalty discount'. That was funny.  Oh, the water was cold in a clean glass. Thus the 1 star review.  Goodbye Cheeburger Cheeburger. My $1.30 discount will not bring me back. You had a good thing going and blew it."}
{"text":"Love it Love it!!! You can add so many toppings to your burger for FREE (w/ a fee extras, real creamy milkshakes and a nice classic feel to the inside of the restaurant! Definately a MUST!"}
{"text":"Interesting that this place closed. The one in Jersey where I lived was packed at all times. I can say perhaps it was the youngsters working here with the attitude of not wanting to serve. Walked in and was the only person there and I could see that I was clearly an annoyance. Not just the waitress but even the person behind the counter -I suppose he was the cook? Food was ok but customer Service is probably what caused this location to close."}
{"text":"Almost as good as the original on Rainbow boulevard. If you order one of the larger burgers make sure you ask for the caiser bum, the honey wheat buns are not large enough for the big burgers."}
{"text":"This place was so AWESOME! After getting the boot from Dave & Buster's i and my friends visted this place to go kick it and get something to eat.  I heard the praise of a few of my friends saying this place was crazy awesome, but I ignored it not really caring what everyone thought. I came in a it's 50s cool! I totally dug it! We sat down and saw the HUGE menu! I barely had enough time to wrap my head around the huge variety of flavors before our waitress came over asking what we wanted.   \"Uhhhh... a few more minutes to read everything on your menu! Oh, waters all around.\"  We got a raised eyebrow from our redheaded waitress and then we ordered practially half the menu. I got the SERIOUS burger which was a 1/2 pound burger and it was a BIG burger! It was so yummy! :) I added their seasonings that come on the table. My toppings were Blue cheese, terriyaki sauce, pineapples & bacon. It was CRAZY awesome, but I'll admit - there were a few bites that made me turn green! But it's all good. After we ordered - we had to ask the waitress for shakes and floats.   BUT their soda did NOT taste good! We told the waitress and she didn't believe us! I think she went off and tasted it for herself before she agreed to remake our floats. We wound up with a dozen cups on the table before the meal was done. I had a cherry coke & vanilla bean ice cream float and my friend had a white chocolate raspberry shake.   At the end of the meal, one of my friends was stuffed and couldn't finish his burger - not sha-girl! I finished my burger AND most of the fries. But danggggg... I was FULL! i dont' think I could hang with their one pound burger! After you're done with the burger - they'll take ur picture with a big burger hat on and they post your picutre in their hall of fame. So everybody can see and aspire to your level of piggishness! LOL, and unfortunatly - I am nothing to aspire to since I could barely finish HALF the amount of food! LOL. Here there were two little kids at a different table who could! *hides in shame*  But eaither way - it's a great place to eat. There's a lot of fun to be had at cheeburger cheeburger. Don't be shy to ask for more time to read the menu because it's HUGE! Have fun and don't bite more than you can chew!"}
{"text":"I always try to stop here on the way out of Cleveland as I really enjoy the burger, fries, and shake.  My only complaint is that it is a little pricey for fast food.  Burger/fries/drink will set you back about $11.  I guess one other complaint as well service is slow.  Guy in front canceled his shake or"}
{"text":"Oh where to begin...  When we first arrived we were seated quickly in a too tight dining area.  My husbands chair was up against another customers chair.  There is no way to maneuver to get to your table so forget getting up to go to the bathroom because you will disrupt the diners around you.  We started w/3 waters with lemon.  Our server brought the waters .... no lemon.  We had to remind him twice to bring the lemon.     The 1/3lb burger is tiny at best, the meat is about the size of a slider but the bun is a regular size burger bun.   A Mcdonald's cheeseburger from their dollar menu is bigger.   So I ordered a classic burger w/mayo/let/mushrooms cooked medium, My daughter had a classic burger cooked medium well w/mayo/let  only.  My husband ordered the pounder and he ordered the \"best of both\" with fries and onion rings.   My daughter and I opted to share a med. fries only.     My burger arrived w/no mushrooms, my daughter's burger was blood rare and we did not get the fries we ordered.  The \"best of both\" was mediocre at best.  The breading used on the onion rings has no flavor and tastes blah so they probably only use flour on them without any type of  seasonings.  My husbands fries were heavily coated w/pepper and appeared old so he didn't even eat them.    I did send both mine and my daughters burger back to be fixed.   It took a while for the food to be returned, I also did inquire about the missing order of fries.  The server said \"oh sorry\" I guess I forgot to order them.   So about 15 mins. later and my daughter and I had finished our mini me burgers, we received fresh hot fries that had not been seasoned at all which was probably a good thing because at least they were edible, but again nothing special.    So all in all I would not recommend this place to anyone!!  It's also kind of pricey.   I received better service and tastier food at Smash burger and it's only a block further.   I will travel the extra block.     This place may do better on the strip especially considering their higher prices and visitors would probably flock to it's doors not knowing any better.  But as local, it's definitely worth my time to drive somewhere where I will get better service and food for my money!!"}
{"text":"Staff was nice. Food needs work.  My burger was VERY greasy. So much so the bun was soggy."}
{"text":"Stopped in to have a shake with my son. I ordered a snickers cheesecake shake - it was good but could have used a little more snickers in the shake. It tasted kind of like a vanilla shake with a few bits of snickers. Buuut I had no idea what to expect either so can't really complain I suppose. My son ordered a blueberry shake that was pretty good- not overpowering with blueberry (they use flavored syrup and no real blueberries). I would suggest offering a kids' size. It is a little bit of a wait so don't stop there if you're in a hurry. Facility was clean and inviting. Overall a decent experience. We will be back to try the food someday!"}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical at first...but the food was good and the service was excellent, considering how understaffed they were. Thin and crispy onion rings and yummy burgers always get me!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite go to places. The owner is always there, friendly staff, completely service oriented. As for the burgers- grass fed beet only which is fantastic and so much better that the franchise burgers you'll find elsewhere. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The roomie is sleeping, good, looks like she will be sleeping for a few more hours, i wanna eat me a BURGER !! But first, gotta earn it - lift weights - check, go for a power walk - check, run back the last 2 miles - check. okay, time to stuff my face !!   CC is about 5 miles from my new casa - kinda of an unusual location. parking sucks. has the 50's diner feel.   so i go for the 1/2 pounder, medium, blue cheese, sauteed onions ( for a 50's diner, should they be grilled onions or sauteed onions ? ) a basket 0f fries and onion rings ( the menu says for 1-2 people, i say it's for 2-4 people ) and an almond joy malt. Total cost - $20 !! damn, that's an expensive brunch !   the burger - cooked medium - i'm impressed with that, but no seasoning to it - call me picky but i just feel a burger tastes better when it's seasoned while cooking as opposed to salting/peppering it after its cooked . also, the meat itself fell apart a little too easily. I still liked the burger but i liked the fries/onion rings but charge a $1 for a dipping sauce ?!? that's bullshit !   the malt ? needed more malt, the coconut taste not too noticeable at the beginning of the malt, but very strong at the end.   And this big deal over eating a 1 pound burger ? come on - at least a 2 pounder if not a 3 pounder to go through all the hubbub !   yeah, i'll try it again, someday."}
{"text":"I am torn between a 3 or 4 star rating. Cheeburger offers a several different sizes patties, from a 1/3 lb. up to a full 1 lb. The meat is nice and flavorful and the vast amount of toppings makes the experience a lot of fun. Many of the toppings are included in the price of the burger and unlimited. The biggest problem I have is that I don't necessarily care for the bun. It's somewhat chewy and takes away from the overall satisfaction of the burger. For example, I think Fuddrucker's has the best burger bun in town. Their bun makes their burger a great burger. I would rate this place a solid 4 stars if they found a way to improve the bun.   The fries and rings are excellent. I like that the rings are battered and not breaded. They also have a nice selection of salads and ice cream desserts which I have not tried. The service has always been excellent. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Because of the fries/rings and service, I am giving a 4 star rating. Burgers alone would have only earned them 3 stars from me. It's very close to home, so I would see myself going back out of convenience."}
{"text":"You know, reviews are really a hit and miss thing since each person has obvious differences in standards and expectations so you kind of have to take them for what they are.   The negative reviews I read almost kept me from coming here but I went with my gut since it was really in the mood for a good solid malt.   I was not disappointed.   The service from the moment you walk in the door is extremely friendly.  Albeit it may be considered a bit slow for some people, my family and I are usually never in a rush when we go out and are always just happy to enjoy the moment of being out and knowing that we dont have to clean up.   The menu is quite expansive and with all of the different combinations that they offer, it is easy to find something to your liking.  Obviously it is a burger joint but they have plenty of other things if that is not your taste.   My wife and I both had burgers and our 5 year old who never eats chicken fingers not only asked for them but ate them up.   The food was cooked well and the flavors were spot on.  The malt we ordered took a bit longer than I thought it should, but SO worth the wait.  And for $6 it was huge.  I can pay nearly the same thing at Red Robin and get half the size malt.   The place gets top marks for atmosphere.  Like others have stated, you would not know that this place is total 50's retro from the outside.   For two burgers, fries, onion rings, chicken fingers, a large malt and a half malt (for our son) the check was $35.  To me that is a total winner.   You will have to make your own judgement but my family will certainly be back.   On a side note, the onion rings are wonderful.  Just a thin light batter so they are not all breading and grease like most you get at other places."}
{"text":"Stopped in before going to the movie tonight and the food was great.  We had burgers and chicken fingers.  The burgers were Big!  with all kinds of toppings... grilled onions, olives, sun dried tomatoes, onion rings, raw onions, lettuce and cheese.  I also had a diet cherry Pepsi.... very tasty.  I always judge a good burger or hotdog place by their fries and these fries were terrific.  Next time I go to the movies it's a cheeseburger!"}
{"text":"Best burgers I've tasted since I got to Montreal (only 2 months ago). The fact that you make your own burger and choose the size according to how hungry you are during your visit is a huge plus. The french fries are fried with the potato skins and are a little bit spicy which are delicious also."}
{"text":"Decor is 1950s diner, boring! Sat down to an explanation of the menu. Basically you choose the size of burger, your choice of medium, medium-well or well done (but basically medium-well to well done, the medium wasn't.) You order your burger and add to that the toppings that you want. One type of cheese from a selection, all the toppings except for a few that are extra, like sauteed onions or mushrooms are $1.49 and bacon is $1.79!   They have malts, sodas and shakes. The soda menu basically consists of soda water and Monin sodas along with some pepsi products including cherry, vanilla and chocolate cola. The malt and shake menus are the most interesting including three different blueberry shakes (blueberry, blueberry cheesecake and blueberry pie.)   My burger was overcooked. The pepperoni was really of low quality, I suggest not ordering it. I don't even want to know who orders the peanut butter on their burger! And I really don't understand why it's an extra $1.49 for onions that are put on the grill at the same time as burger to make sauteed onions.  Service was fine. The seating was fine. Basically it's an acceptable burger joint with good table service. Is this Montreal's best burger? Nope! But it's a nice choice if you are down in the area, especially if you want a great milk shake. In fact, I would recommend them for the shake more than the burger."}
{"text":"Best burger I have had in Vegas. And the shakes are bomb lol staff could do better at being cheery and all. But the food makes up for that."}
{"text":"Complete garbage. Made me sick. Threw it up afterwords. Not worth .the time or money. 3 people and check was 55.00. WTH. Food was sad as hell. Everything al a cart."}
{"text":"ALEX, AJ, AND HIDA WERE OUTSTANDING!! Best service i think i have ever gotten. Very kind hearted and the food was amazing. :D"}
{"text":"Awesome and so much to choose from. The kids loved the food and the atmosphere. I highly recommend this place. It is a nice hidden gem. If you go in grab a free menu to take with. Then you can order pick up and it will be ready to go when you get there about 20 minutes. Customer service is awesome."}
{"text":"Cute place to grab a great burger.  I was so excited that they opened this location in Henderson. I really love the create your own burger concept cause it gives me the chance to try weird combinations. I also love the french fries. They look and taste fresh cut and they have the skin, yum! They have these fun dipping sauces that are cool to try.   The decor here is 50s diner with lots of great little knick knacks. We took our parents here for lunch when they were visiting and they really enjoyed it. The place is also very kid friendly so we are able to take our 1 year old daughter with us which is a big plus. The staff is always really accommodating and super friendly.   I would totally recommend this as a great lunch spot. It's a fun place with lots of nostalgia, and fast service."}
{"text":"I was originally going to give a 2 star, but the longer I waited the visit just got worse and worse. I had been to the rainbow location a while ago and living on this side of town I was excited to see this open. I visited today and had an extremely awful visit. We walked in to a nearly dead restaurant with only two other Couples in the place, we were sat and told about the menu which was the only satisfactory part of or visit. We ordered the appetizer sampler, it came out pretty quick but 2 bites in I see a short curly hair sticking out of my fried mushroom. It was embedded in the batter so I picked up the mushroom when I tried to pick the hair off. We called our server over which took a few minutes, she did apologize and took it away. We could then see her talking with the bunch of co workers gathered behind the counter, no manager came over, nothing was done to make sure we were taken care of. I was upset, because I felt as though we were being so polite and discreet about what we were saying as to not cause a scene of what could have been a pubic hair in my food and I was met with nothing. Our food then came and she told us it was going to be a while for our app sampler which seemed to come out much quicker previously.  My burger was good, my boyfriends hot dog was cold and the onion rings were cold. They finally came back with the appetizer that by this time we didn't want. My boyfriend asked for a box for the app and was ignored,  then when he asked again the other server finally turned around. It took forever waiting for the check which as a discount to our pube food had a \"friends and family\" discount applied and circled. I'm not your friend or your family, I'm a customer that was served awful food with awful service and it seemed as though they were trying to cover that up. We then waited forever for our card to be taken and brought back all while they were not busy and completely over staffed. It seemed like a bunch of ignorant young people who could care less. The overwhelming issue in this restaurant is no management.  Rude, no sense of urgency or customer service. Whoever owns this place needs to clean up quick or its a waste of rent. It has so much potential if they would just hire and staff and manager that had a sense of pride. Check your cameras owners! This place is really terrible."}
{"text":"When you decide to visit this place, be mentally prepared to be rolled out on an emergency bed. I had a serious burger with portobello fries. Can't.. move.. food.. coma.... 5' foot waitress, who looks 18 but really 21, called us out and said we are weak. lol Burger craving satisfied."}
{"text":"We have been here twice. The first time we came because Critical Care Comics was doing a fundraiser and we wanted to support them. I was super happy to see a Gluten Free Bun as an option. The girls working were very patient with us as we ordered our burger creation. The wait for the food was decent we weren't expecting fast because this isn't fast food. We took our food to go and once we ate it it was amazing! We loved the burgers and the fries. The second time we were craving these burgers we decided to do an online order so that when we arrived it would be ready to go. It said it would be ready in about 30 min. We arrived in 45 and when my BF went in to pick it up they didn't even know there was an online order so it wasn't even started so would be another 15-20. They did give us a discount and a free drink and they were very apologetic about it. That is the only reason I reduced the star because I was starving and their online ordering system needs to be communicated with the people in the store better. Online ordering was easy so if I do it again I would probably call to confirm. Definitely will come back food is a 5 and their service is a 5!"}
{"text":"Had a really enjoyable time here.  service was great.  food was delicious. I had the dinner special.  it's the semi-serious burger built to my specifications with a side of their onion rings and of course a shake!  birthday cake and cookie dough!!!  The servers were very attentive.  There was two and both seemed very happy to help us.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Booooo. Lots of hype but I'm not sure why??  Dried up flavorless burger that was a lot smaller than the bun. Bacon was undercooked and the fries were dried up burned sticks.  The only good things were friendly servers and the mocha shake. $45 I'll never see again."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a shake after braving the DMV today for a license renewal. Maybe I was just super cranky because of the two hour wait I had to endure all to have my photo taken, but I was annoyed that even though the woman behind the counter was very warm and friendly, everything there seemed to move in slow motion.   It took awhile to be greeted, the milkshake options were overwhelming, and even after I did choose a milkshake, everyone behind the counter seemed to be socializing, so it took a little while to make. To top things off, the shake was over $6. On the bright side, it was a totally delicious shake, but the price and customer service were kind of off putting.  Maybe my expectations are too high, but if you're a restaurant located next to a DMV, customers will appreciate you way more for speedy service because there's  good possibility that many patrons stopping in are trying to avoid a complete and total mental breakdown after hanging out at the DMV all day."}
{"text":"Good burgers, but they're often undercooked on at least one side. While this may be a step up from other joints where your burger is cooked with little or no consideration for the requested temperature, it's unacceptable for a place which prides itself on its burgers. They only offer three temperatures--medium, medium well, and well--they should be able to nail all three.  Fries are tasty if a bit limp. Rings are a bit battery, if my memory serves me correctly.   No complaints about the shakes... other than they should be bottomless.  Staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This place is a solid novelty burger joint. Order up to 30 toppings on your well-made custom burger."}
{"text":"Don't understand the mediocre reviews.  This place has delicious hamburgers, our server was awesome and helpful, finally, it's really reasonably priced.  $7 for a 3rd ln burger with unlimited toppings?! Yes please."}
{"text":"Hopefully they re open!! :(. This place made you full for a few days! I'm vegetarian and i had many options. My fiancé made it to the wall of fame 2x's."}
{"text":"Great hamburger joint! You can have a regular 1/4 pounder up to over a pounder! Over 25+ toppings. Out of this world onion rings! Awesome shakes with tons of combinations. They have a nice 50's theme inside. This has become a regular spot for me.   If you are looking for a place to have a fundraiser, this is a fun and very generous place to have it at."}
{"text":"We had a great time!  Went with my parents and my small children.  Everyone loved it.  Burgers were awesome.  My dad got the Delirious 3/4lb burger, which was huge but extra juicy as it was so big.  The onion rings were freshly cut, battered and fried.  The chili cheese fries were very good.  Kids meals came in little cardboard classic cars.  The service was very friendly and accommodating to our small children.  The food took a little while to come out, but being as everything is made \"fresh not frozen\", I didn't think the wait was unreasonable.  The whole experience was great.  I loved how they had a lot of vegetarian options for my husband as well.  Overall, a 5 star experience.  Thanks! We will be back."}
{"text":"Burgers were very good...just be careful when you order a side of fries or onion rings...  WAY too much for 1 person!"}
{"text":"Not sure how the food is yet because it's been 45min since we ordered. The service here is SLOW! Maybe it's an off night? First time here & not the best first impression :/"}
{"text":"I had visited this place for the first time due to a fundraiser for the organization, UNLV Circle K International. Both me and my friend weren't that hungry so we each got a custom shake and shared the \"Best of Both\" which was fries and onion rings.   The custom shake i got contained oreos, cookie dough, and white chocolate. I had ordered the regular size so it came in the metal container they used to make it in. Decent size. Flavors were good and lots of cookie dough. Though for some odd reason, it tasted a bit sweeter than i had preferred. My friend had gotten pineapple and ?????. Not as sweet. Tasted pretty good actually.   When the fries and onion rings came. It was eh. Reason for that is because the fries were unevenly sized so some burned during the frying process while some were good. I hope they dont expect people to eat the burnt crispy ones. T_T we had ordered the horseradish dipping sauce too. waiter said it was good with the onion rings. i didnt taste any horshradish at all. disappointing. ketchup and their special seasoning (strong in black pepper and whatever seasoning that gave the sour taste) was better.   A lot of my friends had gotten burgers (ranging from 1/4 lb to 1lb to even the 2lb). the 1/4 lb and the 1 lb looked decent. Good thing about this place is you can almost add any topping on there.  Reason why i said it looked decent was (refer to my picture of the 2lb)... that looks almost disgusting. Then again, 2lb of ground meat is kind of hard to cook together...   Some people were complaining about some smell but i had not smelled anything until later in the night. One of my friends had ordered their 1lb burger late (they came late) and the burger had passed by me. I had smelled this disgusting smell. One of my other friends believe its the cheese but i highly highly doubt it. Melted swiss cheese does NOT give that kind of smell. Or rather almost any melted cheese. Me and my friend who didnt eat much came to the hypothesis about either it being unfresh meat or some odd seasoning or way it was cooked that made it produce such a smell. Once i had smelled it, i actually was happy i didnt have much of an appetite earlier and order a burger.   No one complained about the taste so i guess the taste was good, which was the reason i had not put this at 1 star. The onion rings were decent as well as the fries, aside from the burnt pieces. Most of the burgers looked decent aside from the 2lb one that looked like it was falling apart.   If u were to ask me if i were to come here again, for the shakes, maybe. But for the burgers, most likely not.   But pricing, here's to give you an idea for the outrageous sized ones.   1lb - $12 2lb - $20"}
{"text":"Yuck! Greasy nasty drippy soggy nasty food. If you want heart problems, go here.  Nice inside but food is nasty!"}
{"text":"The cheeseburgers here are great.  And they should be.  Also the atmosphere is fun 50's and my kids love it.  BUT there are a few things that are missing.  The buns should be better quality.  The service has issues sometimes and be careful stepping away from a burger and fries.  I probably should have known better but I ordered a salad and it was gross.  Wanna like this place but they need to step up quality."}
{"text":"the worst !  horrible service- not one sile or thank you  worst fries/onion ever!  it tasted like shit  discusting burger expesive for a burer joint ..............would never ever go there again............."}
{"text":"Was hunting for a new place to try and came across here.  Choose your patty and and of the 30 toppings!  Said there was over 6 million different combinations.  Onion rings were great, from a tempura batter.  I'm not a big shake person but my friend said it was really good and I tried a bit and it was amazing!  Next time in Vegas I will definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband always drive by this place so we decided to try it. The atmosphere was very nice. The theme was adorable and retro. The waitress was very friendly and helpful with the menu. I got a butterscotch shake and it was great. I got the cheese fries and the seasoning was great. Not to salty like most fries. My burger was fresh as well. I will be going back to try more flavor of the many shakes they have."}
{"text":"I am not sure why this place has such high reviews. The food was not good. The fries were flavorless and soggy. Reminded me of old fries reheated in the microwave. The onion rings were ok but lacked flavor. The hamburger was not anything special either. Milkshake was the only thing worth having again. Will likely not be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is all about having fun and enjoying the food!   Once in a while you have a business that truly takes pride in building their business clientele and therefore values honest feedback. I had a terrible visit in July when the chef of this Eastern Cheeburger Cheeburger couldn't get my hamburger temperature correct and my family didn't get shakes made to their specifications. The owner read my comments, apologized about my experience, made some changes, then invited me back.   My teenage boys had the 1-pounder burger loaded with their choice toppings. I had the 3/4 pounder Delirious Burger with my choice toppings. The hamburgers were really good, and the temperatures were perfect. One of my boys finished the 1-pounder and had his picture taken for the \"Repeat Offenders\" board that highlights the few who have eaten the entire burger more than once.  We shared the loaded fries with cheese, chili, and jalapeños. They were delicious. The boys had the Shake-a-Soda with their meal. It is a syrup that is put into carbonated water to make a carbonated beverage drink. You can mix and match flavors and they are unlimited. I think my boys had 5 of them each! I wasn't crazy about it when I tasted them, but I can see why kids like them.  When we were done, we each had a shake. I had the blueberry cheesecake. This was super good. All the shakes were great! The food was great! The restaurant was clean and the staff was pleasant. Thank you Monica and Alex for demonstrating excellent customer service skills."}
{"text":"I was out running errands on New Year's Day, no not shopping and self-indulging, but real life depending on errands.  I had seen Cheeburger Cheeburger before and wondered what it was like.  So in an almost empty shopping center parking lot, I discovered they had cars parked out front and were open.    I wasn't sure at first, because the place wasn't hip enough, but once I saw a burger delivered to the table next to me, I knew this was going to better than average.  They exceeded all my expectations.    The toppings are endless, like the other review mentioned, 15 cheese options including feta!    But the real test was the taste.  Oh my goodness, the burger flavor with all your topping choices was excellent!  Cheeburger Cheeburger is definitely the best \"sit-down & hold with two hands\" burger around!    Please visit them & see for yourself, plus the prices are excellent!  You will spend almost the same for a thin dry overcooked fast food burger!"}
{"text":"Shakes are great, burgers depend of who's cooking them obviously. I come here all the time and the beef patty will be tasteless once in a while. The service is nice and friendly."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a cool feel of a 50s diner with amazing hamburgers, shakes, fries, and onion rings.  I had the chili cheese fries, onion rings, and a 1/2 pound burger with a strawberry/banana shake. You can select from a ton of toppings for your burger, and they offer a half-dozen different types of sauces. The burger was very juicy and tasty. I just wish the bun could support all the toppings and juice before becoming soggy toward the last four-five bits.  You could spend a good half-hour just looking over the selections for shakes. They offer numerous freshly made shake combinations. I loved my shake! The onion rings were great along with the seven selections of dipping sauces. The chili cheese fries with jalapeño slices were also very good.   They sing happy birthday and have a hamburger challenge at Cheeburger Cheeburger that can make the restaurant loud at times. It was all in great fun - but not the type of place for a quiet business meeting or romantic date to be sure. This is more of a family fun and interactive dining experience. The food is truly worth it.  My waitress was Sabrina, and she was awesome! Thank you."}
{"text":"It saddens me to write this review for cheeburger cheeburger but I went 3 separate occasions and all three times I was disappointed. I use to love to visit the locations in Missouri and was always satisfied with the service and the food. This location is disappointing to sum up all three trips into one review: overcooked burgers and un-attentive staff. An example of the poor service is I ordered one of their shaker sodas I had to ask for more flavoring because it was almost more soda water than flavor, then I go to pour the cup and the waitress didn't put the lid on and the soda went all over the table. The waitress did apologize when I told her what happened, when we were leaving I told her I didn't get it all up so she was going to need to move the stuff off the table she said she was not going to worry about it because she was almost off. The last time I was there my husband sat his cup at the end of the table because he was waiting on a refill because it had sat empty for a while she waitress came to the end of their service area looked at us went then turned around and went to go talk in the kitchen for a bit. My summary of this place was that they are more happy socializing with each other than waiting on guests, they over cooked our burgers 2 out of the 3 visits and the servers don't pay attention to customers. I have decided to save going to cheeburger cheeburger until I go back to Missouri were I know I will leave a happy customer."}
{"text":"***Closed***  This place wasn't bad but it is always sad to see a locally owned eatery close up shop."}
{"text":"This place is soooo good. You can put anything you want on your burger. They make it to your liking. Just like the milkshakes you can mix flavors. They are so good too! The wings are nice and flavorful. And the dessert is amazing! Lol. Don't let me get started on the apps either. Everything is just so delicious. I recommend this place to everyone. We usually go at night so it's never packed and the service is great!"}
{"text":"Very good place.  50's Diner theme.  And a 20oz hamburger that if you eat the whole thing you get your picture on the wall.  Over 300,000 shake combinations!  There are salads, chicken and vegie burgers availble if you like.    Service has always been very good.    I will be back!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this new burger joint!  So much so that we were there 2 days in a row. Both times the burgers, fries, onion rings, and shakes were top notch. Love the flexibility of ordering the burger exactly how you want it. The shakes are amazing. The service was very attentive so maybe they worked the kinks out from their opening weeks. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"First, I have to say that I tried to explain the name to my English husband and he just did not understand the humor.  At any rate, he was willing to try this place.  We have been twice and, although my husband likes the burgers, I am just not convinced yet.  It is possible that I have not tried the right combination yet.  On our first visit, I had the chicken wrap with avocado.  Except it was not avocado - it was more of a guacamole spread.  It lacked the fresh avocado taste that I was expecting.  The fries on this occasion were a bit hit and miss with the seasoning but good overall and the onion rings were nice - with soft rather than crisp breading.  Today I tried the Bleu Chicken which includes swiss and bleu cheese.  The first problem is that the chicken is about half the size of the bread.  I can deal with this because the grilled sourdough bread is nice with cheese.  The other problem I had is that the swiss cheese had a really strong taste.  Of course, this is my personal preference but it was a little off-putting.  The fries this time were seasoned perfectly and uniformly.  Also, we ordered the half \"best of both\" as we did with our first visit but there seemed to be so much more in the basket today (certainly not a bad thing!!!).  So, I have not written off Cheeburger Cheeburger.  The chicken is moist and the fries taste good.  I think that I just need to find the combination that works for me.  I will definitely try it again - especially since I joined their mailing list and receive coupons regularly.  I think if you are a beef eater, you will enjoy it greatly."}
{"text":"100 flavors of milkshakes. And I didn't try one. I got the cherry \"shaker\" soda instead. I'm still kicking myself for it.   This place is a dream for the control freak. It's also a nightmare for the indecisive. You get to choose how big you want your burger, what kind of cheese and what toppings you want (and there are lots!)...plus all the damn milkshake flavors.   After taking about 20 minutes to decide what I wanted, I settled upon the \"semi-serious\" burger with cheddar. My counterpart and I shared a basket of \"frings\" which were fantastically greasy. My only complaint: the bottom half of my hamburger bun was paper thin, while the top was practically an entire loaf of bread. You get more than three toppings and you get one messy basket. Just put the top bun on the bottom as well, I say!  I adored the glasses made out of jelly jars, apparently that's how they do it down south as we were schooled by our Missouri-born waiter. I myself never considered Missouri to be part of the south but...to each his own.  I'm looking forward to fattening myself up on many of their shakes in the future!"}
{"text":"Burger was good, The shake was fantastic, I would go back"}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a burger joint.  Is not as good as say a Shake Shack or an In N Out but had a great diner vibe.  I would try it again but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"visit: 7/14/2011 7pm. I am the hamburglar. I can't get enough damn hamburgers, I could eat one a day,seriously. I heard of this place from my sister who does nothing but rave,wear their shirts, and apparently gets free sodas. I thought the 50's motif was pretty cool-seems like the way of the diner has damn near gone the way of the dinosaur,here in Vegas. They have all the decor and look, plus they actually play music from the 50's that everyone is singing in there,lol. I was impressed by the extensive menu options, mind you,there aren't many types of things to order,for example: Specialize in a few types of burgers, but tons of available toppings at no extra charge. you can customize your soda, milkshake, malt, coffee, and sundae/banana split. Also they serve fries and onion rings with different dipping sauces. I don't know about you, but I am a HUGE SUCKER for variety/choices and this place fit the bill.   our food order: Me-1/3 hamburger,done med. pickles,tomato,lettuce,fresh onion. hubby-angus cheeplatter with salad,onion rings kiddo-fried mac and cheese with carrots and ranch in flaming car!!  As far as burgers go, we both agreed the outside seemed a little underdone, and I did notice there wasn't any seasoning,but still good.  drink order: me-pear,mango shake a soda,free refills!! 1/2 banana-chocolate-PB shake (half size seemed big, it was as big as my soda!) kiddo-birthday cake shake  All of us tasted each others things and were very pleased. My shake was fricken amazing, and I'm glad I didn't order anything else.I  was stuffed.  I heard of bad reviews mostly consisting of slow service-we had one waiter covering the whole damn store, and he was quick to refill and take away everything. Love it. good job Chris.  Finish the big hamburger and get your pic on the wall when you walk in. An overall really cool place I will definitely return. Just wish it wasn't in BFE"}
{"text":"I would never eat here again. First of all, the place smells like a nail salon. I would have never eaten there just because of that but I was with my family. No one likes walking into a food restaurant and smelling acetone.  I got a classic burger, it was boring and didn't taste good. My mom got a wrap and that sucked, and my dad got a melt and that was inedible. I wish I never had to eat there. They didn't like any of the food either."}
{"text":"Great burgers and great service! Nothing fancy just the perfect place for your burger cravings. Try the 20oz burger...if you finish you get your pic on the board! My boyfriend finished his along with a large fry and onion ring and a shake!!!"}
{"text":"I visited Cheeburger Cheeburger on September 10, 2016. It was such a bad experience with awful service I do not know where to begin. Alex was our waiter. Alex got our orders all wrong. My son ordered a hamburger no cheese, lettuce, mustard and ketchup. She brought him a burger with cheese. She said that she would take care of his hamburger. It was reordered, but the next time it ha no lettuce. She said that she would take care of this order by taking his meal off of the sales receipt. When we received the receipt, she had only taken off our drinks and a family discount neither o which equaled his meal. I asked her about this and mentioned to her that she said that she would take care of this bill. She responded, I did take care of it. I asked her to do what she said that she would do and she said fine. She brought back the bill and she charged me more than what she had charged me the first time. I asked her how could she charge me more. Her response was, well  took your sodas off before but I put them back since you asked for me to make good on my promise. I then asked her to reduce it as she promised. She refused and walked off. She threw down the final bill. She would not give me my bill.I asked to speak with the manager. She refused. I stood there for 5 minutes and decided it was a waste of my time. I asked another employee for my bill. I was given my bill, I paid and walked out.   I called the managers other store to get his phone number. I received his number and he never called me back. Bottom line, the service at this location is awful. Alex is rude and consistently makes mistakes. She had to correct some mistakes she had made with some other customers while I was eating there. The manager was there at the time and left before I could also complain. In sum, rudeness, mistakes and poor service overall."}
{"text":"Well; It was my choice to go here when asked by my Dad and BF asked where I the prego girl wanted to go for lunch.  I was not too excited about my choice after the service and my food.  Service was very slow and the girl serving us was kinda blah and not interested in explaining their ordering method to us.  Which is a little different.  I ordered a lemonade, for 2.99, are you serious??  I also got a chicken Caesar wrap,  I should have gotten a cheeseburger I know, but we were having steak for dinner. There was WAY too much bad Caesar dressing, a gross amount of pepper jack cheese, only melted on a part of the wrap.  And there was chicken in one half and not in the other.  The other two got burgers and said it was good, didn't look like anything special to me.  Although they do have many choices for you to add to your burger.    The drinks were very over prices and the service lame.  I wont be going back, even to try a burger, I make beter than those looked any ways."}
{"text":"Mmmmm delicious. Had the loaded fries with chili, cheese, and jalapeños and DEVOURED them in 13 seconds. My burger was juicy.....in fact the juices were running down my arm. I also love the fact how the burgers are cooked to order!  Staff very friendly and attentive.  Milkshake was ok.   Go!!"}
{"text":"this place is great, you get incredibly full and its definitely not healthy for everyday eating but it is a great indulgence! you create everything from the shakes to the burgers i recommend going all out when you go there"}
{"text":"My husband is out to try all the burger places in Vegas & this one left us dissatisfied.  The burger bun was awful.  Fell apart while trying to eat it & our fries/rings combo came out 5 minutes AFTER the burgers even though there was only one other group in the place & their order was on their table already.  The rings are great though & they have a nice selection of toppings but those things are NOT enough to get us back to the restaurant."}
{"text":"We saw this place driving by & mad fun of the name. Didn't look like much from the outside either, kind of a hole in the wall place. Finally decided to try & happy we did. Have been there 3 times since. Build your own burger kind of joint, can even choose size of meat. Made fresh, good flavor and TONS of topping options. A little pricey and the wait can be long. Cool kids meal comes in a little cardboard shaped car. Inside set up like old school diner, could be cleaned up/updated a bit. Overall good burger joint."}
{"text":"I try to drink every flavor of lemon aide every time I go. The chicken patty melt is to kill for the flavors of the chicken captures your soul. I love this place  and I am glad it's around the corner I sometimes go alone... I know I have no control. Who every says the food was not good is lying because they are trying to keep it to themselves. YUM YUMMY YUMMIEST"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the burger and the 50's diner atmosphere. Food was Ok but over priced. Two small cokes are 5.50 Onion rings were good and the burger was done according to my request."}
{"text":"I didn't like this burger at all. Dry as wood and at a cost of almost 15.00 I should have walked down the street to 5 guys.."}
{"text":"Cheeburger Cheeburger is a great spot for a good lunch, as long as you are not counting calories.   The burgers are good, and the shakes are great.   Cheese fries and onion rings are good picks here too.   The only criticism i would add is that the service is always a little slow.   I don't think they keep enough servers on staff, and if ordering a shake during a busy time period, expect to wait 20 minutes, before you get it.      Unless you're on a Paula Deen diet, you'll want to limit the number of trips you make here, because the food is delicious, but loaded with fat.  Also, note that the zipcode for this place is Malvern, but it is actually in Frazer, on route 30."}
{"text":"Visiting Chandler we were kind of pressed to find some place good to eat for lunch. My brother recommended Cheeburger Cheeburger and it was a pleasant surprise.   Ultimately: The food was pretty delicious, and if based on food alone I would give it a 4 star rating. There are several little nuances that bugged me which bring it down to a 3.   The menu is pretty confusing. Without any easy to order preconfigured options, it can be a pretty intimidating venture for a first-time customer.   The food takes a little bit of time to cook, like 10+ minutes even during a relatively unbusy time like 3pm... which is pretty frustrating for burgers and fries.   I'd prefer the buns to have sesame seeds, and they charge extra for bacon which I wish was a lot more crisper than how they cook it by default.   If you order sides (which are huge but tasty), expect to pay greater than $10 per person. My brother got the patty melt, which looked like a pound of meat and was HUGE.   In the end, this place's food is pretty solid. My main complaint is what you get for the cost, which makes the little nit-picky things venture into the realm of annoying and unpleasant."}
{"text":"I don't think I've had service this slow at any burger place! Ten minutes to even get our drink order. Thirty minutes in and still no food."}
{"text":"I'd say the Challenge, the atmosphere/service and the shakes are what really sell this place. The wall is lined with pictures of people next to the cute (and dorky) stuffed burger prop indicating their status as people who survived the burger challenge. While I was there, a kid proudly posed for a pic after completing the children 1/2 lb. burger challenge.  I thought the burgers were pretty good. Not stupendous, but above \"average\" which is why this place gets 4 stars. Plus, you have so many options to mix and match burger toppings. I added sun dried tomatoes to mine for no additional cost, though it was 99 cents to have my onions sauteed. Hmm...  The shake was the highlight of this visit for me. I had strawberry cheesecake flavor. Ohhhh it was soo good. I'd come back just for that. Service was really friendly too, and I liked the cute 50s atmosphere. I'd say this is a great place for lunch and good if you have kids."}
{"text":"Nice 1950's style decor, a huge menu, dozens of topping for your burger, including some really weird ones to make you excited about your burger.  Their burgers come in several sizes, including the 20 oz. version.  Wow.  Lots of flavors of shakes too.  I tried the classic burger, which is the smallest, coming in at 5.5 ounces.  I am glad I didn't get anything larger.  The meat itself was dried out and tasted like cardboard, even though I ordered it medium well.  I would hate to think what they do to the well done version.  The lettuce was the shredded kind you can buy in those gigantic pre made bags.  The bun was also tasteless and boring.  I tried the tzatziki sauce, which was not garlicky or very cucumbery.  It tasted like sour cream, basically.  Shoulda had ketchup I guess.  The price of the burger was only slightly higher than Five Guys, but it was smaller.  Ouch.  There are many better burger joints out there.  Like Five Guys, even."}
{"text":"It's really a 3.5 stars.  The service and food was good but then again I went off hours after reading that service and food was better off hours.    I had Sabrina as my server and she was very attentive without being too intrusive.  Hard to find a server that knows the difference. :-)  The food was ok. The burger was not seasoned well but after sprinkling some of the seasoning salt at the table, it tasted better. And the bun was COLD.  It started to kind of break apart as I was biting into the burger. It sat there a little bit as I was eating my fries first. .. But it felt like the top bun had not been heated at all.   Fries and onion rings were awesome!  But I think the onion rings were better then the fries in my opinion.  But then again I love onion rings.  :-)  Overall I would come back to try it again.  It was $15 for one person... burger, fries and onion rings and a drink.  I thought it was worth it.  I just hope that next time the burger is hotter.  Next time I will come at a busy time so that I can compare."}
{"text":"Burgers are cooked with high quality meat.  Very fresh.  Onion rings were top notch as well.  Service was very good although there were not many people there the day I went.  Had a milkshake as well that was solid.  Only gripe is price.  A little too high for dogs and PP&J.  $72 bill (included tip) for 2 burgers, grilled cheese, dog, PP&J, fries and a milkshake.  Will be back again sometime."}
{"text":"I love cheese burgers and what better place to have one than a place named \"Cheeburger Cheeburger\".. Claimed to be voted Best Burger in over 29 cities.. Lets find out the fuss..  The Delirious (3/4 pound or 14 ounces): 100 percent all Natural Angus Beef, 100 percent vegetarian fed, Never Frozen... They had many toppings to choose from. I went with: American Cheese, Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato and Mayo. It was HUGE!!  All in between a pair of Potato Buns. For being All Natural (healthy?) Angus, It had some flavor but it was mediocre. I like the buns, it balanced out the big patty. The toppings were fine and expected. Decent burger but can't compare to the other Heavy Weight Contenders..  Fries and Rings: half fries and half onion rings. the medium is enough for 2-4 people, especially if you order a serious sized burger. They weren't that great.. They had 4 different dips to choose from, I liked the Creamy Jalapeno sauce (the rest I wont even bother to write about). I still prefer Ketchup.  Watermelon Iced Tea and Watermelon Lemonade: Both Refreshing and I love that it was served in a glass jar.   Many Variety of Burger sizes/toppings, flavored beverages, shakes/malts, sauces.... Everything very customizable. I didn't like the fact they charged for almost every little thing (refills on certain drinks and dipping sauce..). The Service was decent, Ambiance like a retro diner or Johnny Rockets and then add a whole bunch of flourescent pink neon lights! Value, on the negative side with all things considered.. They do have a Burger challenge: \"Our Famous Pounder\" or 20 ounces! I barely finished the 3/4 pound (1 step below in size).. But for kicks and a picture of me tacked on their Cheeburger Cheeburger \"Wall of Famers\", it maybe worth a try one day!"}
{"text":"the burgers are awesome.  u choose just about everything that goes into and onto your burger.  u can also order a half onion rings/half fry with your meal.. and create any kind of shake imaginable... you can even ask for a burger shake if you want.  the portion of burger you get can be as huge as you want.  they even have a burger to conquer if your in the mood for that.  if you do kill that cow [again] you get your picture on their wall!    it's a diner that lets u use your imagination with your burger and shake.  they have salads and all that too.... buy why would u come to a place called cheeburger cheeburger for a salad.  add it to your burger!"}
{"text":"The family likes this place. Planning our next trip so my son can eat the 1/2 pound, and I can eat the 1 pound."}
{"text":"We had driven by this place a bunch of times when we were moving from the NW side of Vegas to Southern Highlands. Both my wife and I are vegetarians so we thought that we probably wouldn't enjoy eating here.   Boy was I wrong. This place is amazing. We ordered their grilled cheeses sandwiches. I had rye bread (which most places dont have) and she had hers on white. They were amazing. We got to choose all sorts of options and I think I went for the hotpeppers.   Did I mention the milkshakes? Let me tell you about the milkshakes. This place is worth a visit just for those. You might want to throw some fries and fresh dipped onion rings in the mix too though.   I can't wait to go back is about all I can say. Everyone was super nice to us and the joint has that vintage neon burger joint feel to it."}
{"text":"I try to stay away from writing reviews for chain restaurants, but upon seeing that Cheeburger Cheeburger had an average rating of 4 stars, I felt that it was necessary to bring to light the mediocrity of this place.  It's not that its absolutely terrible, because it's not, but everything about this particular Cheeburger location is a bit off.  The atmosphere is basically a poor attempt at 1950s kitsch-diner, which I don't really understand why they want to make this place look like a '50s diner, it just seems like an idea that was hashed out in conference room one day, and then poorly executed.  This particular location suffers from the \"mall effect,\" that is, a lot of families with young kids screaming.    The food is okay, and the menu has some fun and interesting options for burger toppings (guacamole, onion rings, pineapple, teriyaki sauce, etc).  One thing that slightly irked me about this place was that the burgers don't come with french fries, you have to order them separately, which I think is restaurant sacrileg.  I know I'm getting knit-picky, so I'll wrap it up.  If you want a better burger-chain restaurant experience, I recommend  the Red Robin that is literally 500 yards away in Tempe Marketplace; it has better food, better service, and a much better atmosphere."}
{"text":"Been here once. Service is okay. Burger is okay. Milkshake is of course, sweet. I don't know. I guess people like it here because you can customize the burger. It's not just for me. If I gonna use my cheat day here, I might as well go to Bachi Burger or Fuku Burger."}
{"text":"Cheeburger Cheeburger in the Tempe Marketplace has only been open for two weeks and this showed in the nervousness of the staff and the slowness of the kitchen. That said, the food we got in the end was great for what it was- diner burgers.  You pick your burger size, from 5.5 oz (pre-cooked) through 20 oz, and if you finish the latter, you get your picture on the wall of fame. Hubby and I both had the 7 oz burger, which was plenty big. You choose your cheese, and then as many toppings as you want (which among your classics included salsa, chopped garlic, jalapeno poppers, sun dried tomatoes, pineapple, and tons of specialty sauces). Hubby asked for peanut butter on his burger, which was not among one of the named toppings, but was a shake flavor, and he got it. You can also choose toppings like bacon, sauteed mushrooms, sauteed onions, chili, or even a whole portobello for an additional charge. Our burgers were cooked to medium, just as we had requested, and were quite tasty.  We also split a basket of Frings, an onion ring and fry combo. The onion rings were among the best I've ever had, and Hubby called them \"darn near perfect.\" They were thin and crispy, with a tempura-like batter. The fries are fresh cut and had good flavor- maybe some were a tad overdone and not as hot as they could have been.   I had their VanillaCola (made with syrup) which was good, and Hubby tried a shake with pistachio and macadamia which I thought would have been made with real nuts, but it seems to have been made only with syrup flavors. It was still good, and quite thick.  The decor was 50's diner, the wait staff all seemed like freshmen in college, and apparently there is a way to place your order ahead of time on-line. There are chicken and salad options as well. Our bill came to about $33 with tip. We'll probably try the other new places in the Tempe Marketplace before we return to Cheeburger, but we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had talked about this place for a couple of months before finally trying it. I have to say that I love the 50s décor and the friendly service.   I will admit that I'm not a huge fan of burgers, but these were actually good! I ordered the classic cheeseburger with cheddar cheese on the roll. I prefer my red meats well-done, but the patty wasn't dry at all, so that was nice. For an average-sized burger, it was filling and delicious.   The waitress that night was flustered due to a staff shortage, but she still regularly checked up on us and made sure that we got everything that we needed and ordered. The host was extremely nice and gave us a general overview of the menu as we had never been there.   My only complaint is that the French fries weren't very crispy. The seasoning was great, but I was hoping that the fries themselves would be crunchier."}
{"text":"My visit here was such a major let down. Going in, I was quite excited. The choices seemed endless and my mind was working overtime creating various concoctions of burgers and shakes. But alas, it was all in vain.  The exterior is rather deceptive. It can be easy to drive right by this place. And the outside doesn't even hint at the inside. But I found the inside to be a bit of a let down. 50s diner themes can be great. But this place felt like they phoned it in.  Before reviewing the menu, I had already decided on my custom milkshake. One of my absolute favorite milkshakes I've ever had was a \"freckle face\" (chocolate chip). And here was my opportunity to have that again and add a little something extra, like perhaps coconut. But upon looking at the menu, I discovered that they don't have chocolate chips. Undeterred and still feeling optimistic, I opted for the Almond Joy. When my shake arrived, though, it was basically a chocolate milkshake with some generic flavoring labeled \"Almond Joy\". There were no chunks (like the menu pictures had led me to believe) or great flavors or anything. And I don't know why they even bothered serving it with a spoon - it was all liquidity, no thickness.  For a starter / side, I opted for a half order of half fries, half onion rings. And I, of course, had a mini freak out when I saw the dipping sauces (I have a major love for dipping sauces) and was compelled to order the foursome (one of each of their sauces). Another let down. The fries were delicious, but the onion rings were too greasy to eat. And the only dipping sauce that was edible was the cheese sauce (which was totally out of a can). Though, I guess when it comes to value, I can say that the half order was huge and enough for a family of 4.  For the burger, I went with the 1/3 lb., medium, with bacon, blue cheese, lettuce, and tomato. I figured it was a rather safe, non-crazy choice - so I could be sure to judge the burger on the burger, as opposed to the win or fail of some crazy flavor combination. When the burger arrived, it looked great. I cut it in half and it looked like a perfect medium. But after the first bite, I was seriously underwhelmed. There was zero flavor. How could a burger be flavorless? It was medium and pink, but not juicy. It was pretty much inedible. Now, I am hoping that perhaps this place is just hit or miss. My friend had been here before, and ordered the exact same burger, and loved it. And even he (who was along this trip to watch me eat) agreed that the burger this time was quite bad.  So despite the service being good and there being some neat things (like a photo album on each table with pictures of the 1 lb. burger challenge), the food was not good."}
{"text":"This is a cute 50s-style diner. And, shockingly, they specialize in burgers. But never fear, if you aren't a burger eater, you'll find appetizers, salads, hot dogs, and chicken on the menu too.   It's small-ish, so you may have to wait if it's crowded. Lots of 50s decors to look at. Standard set-up with booths lining the walls and tables in the middle.  Our server was friendly and attentive. Food is brought out by other staff and not your assigned server, and we noticed this resulted in some issues with food being brought to the wrong tables.  The big thing here - and the best part of dining here - is that you can design your own milkshake and your own burger. Like you can go crazy with the different possible combinations.   Creating a milkshake was my favorite part. I went with a white chocolate M&M malt. It was seriously delicious! That said, though, it was not exactly the best quality or particularly well-made.  With the burgers, you choose the size (1/4 lb. to 1 lb.), the bun (just two options for bun), the cheese, and then any number of toppings. Some toppings like bacon cost extra. And while it's not listed on the menu, you can go for a 2 lb or 3 lb burger.   If you eat a \"pounder\", you get your picture taken with a giant stuffed burger and they put it up on the wall. James O., naturally, couldn't resist this challenge.   I loved designing my own burger. Hint: Banana peppers are very tasty on a burger! However, the burger themselves weren't really anything to write home about. Just regular old burgers with not really any flavor or juiciness.  You can order your burger (and some other options like chicken and whatnot) as a platter, so it comes with fries or whatever side. Or you can order them a la carte and get a basket of fries or onion rings (or combo of both) to share. We opted to get a basket of fries and share. The fries were...well, fries. Good enough to eat. Nothing worthy of stuffing oneself with them or craving them. They also offer a variety of overpriced dipping sauces. While all were superior to regular old ketchup, none were exactly tasty.  All in all, this is a fun place. And my experience here was way better than a few years ago at their other Vegas location. Definitely family-friendly. And can even be a fun date spot. Go crazy creating fun milkshake and burger combinations. Do the eating challenge and devour a pounder. Just don't expect the best burger you've ever had."}
{"text":"Like others I wasn't terribly impressed with Cheeseburger Cheeseburger. Maybe it's because of all the hype?  On the plus side:   They greet you when you walk in the door, the staff is very friendly, and the menus are clear with pictures of what you get to order. The meat tasted fresh. The prices were reasonable and the portions were large.  The downside:   They only serve medium or more done burgers. I am a fan of a medium rare burger (leaning towards rare) so my medium burger tasted medium well like there was a hint of pink (barely) and the outside was super done The french fries were burned AND cold.    I will not return."}
{"text":"My wife loves a great burger, so I thought we'd check this place out.  Great atmosphere and very friendly staff. Kolina was our server and she was very attentive. Our drinks stayed full and the food came out pretty quick.  The cook(Olympius) even came out to make sure the food was to our liking.  We will definitely be coming here again!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible.The girl working the counter must hate her job. She was not friendly at all. This was my first time there and it will be my last."}
{"text":"It's so sad that it's gone!  Yes, Best of the Best on the Main Line. Beats 5 Guys, Smashburger, Shake Shack in my opinion. Not only did they have the best burgers, they had the largest selection of toppings and milkshake flavors. They're onion rings were crisp, not greasy. They're fries.. were good..but there is not much you can do with a potato. The people were always so nice and friendly. The ambiance was fun-50's music. I feel a little lost now that they're gone."}
{"text":"I would say this place is a solid 3 stars, but because of our awesome service from Rayna, I gave an extra star. I'll start off by saying the restaurant is absolutely adorable. 50's diner feel with awesome decor, neon lights, and great music. The menu was cool, there were plenty of options to choose from and our server explained everything thoroughly. I ordered the turkey burger, my boyfriend ordered the angus, and we got loaded fries as well. The loaded fries were delicious. My boyfriend enjoyed his burger and I didn't have anything to really complain about my turkey burger. To be honest, the food wasn't extraordinary, but it wasn't bad either. This was worth a visit because of the atmosphere of the restaurant, and of course the service. The food wasn't bad and the price was reasonable. My boyfriend and I came in 30 minutes before they were supposed to close so the wonderful service was unexpected and very much appreciated."}
{"text":"I ate at the original location on Sanibel Island in the late 80s. I can't remember what I thought of the place back then.  Fast forward to 2014...  Ordered two burgers cooked medium. They came out well done and had zero taste. I loved the toppings but for a better burger at a better price, I'll stick with Five Guys. It blows this place away."}
{"text":"Kick ass burgers and shakes and the service is always great. Parking sucks, but I think they're moving locations."}
{"text":"Hmm I ended up just leaving menu is all al a carte? If you order a combo it's a ten oz burger with 3-4 sides? Way to much food. The waitress pointed out a burger and fries is cheaper al a carte then a combo. True , sort of. You pay extra for bacon , mushrooms & onions. So your \"25\" free toppings is regular sauce & veggies most places just offer. Example 5 guys. Then if you get fries you pay for every dipping sauce? So a 5.5 oz bacon mushroom Chz burger with fries will run you almost $15 . Bathroom needs repair , towel dispenser barley worked and fell on me. Unimpressed like one user said similar to Johnny rockets, decor is nothing to write about , food is over over priced & the place is falling apart"}
{"text":"first time coming to cheeburger cheeburger,  I grab something to goo. The waitress was very nice she knew I was  a newbie so she explained to me the menu and told me about the burger challenge.  I got the serious burger with the sampler of fried pickle,mushrooms,and fried artichoke, and they were all great. next time I go I will definitely do the burger challenge."}
{"text":"Wento the nearest Chee burger place and loved the service. people are very nice and welcoming to new customers. I got the pertobello melts and it was good and huge. Not your everyday burger place. Love the 50-60's theme worth the visit!"}
{"text":"CLOSED  But probably for good reason, the place was not well kept. I distinctly remember the carpet stains throughout. The burgers were pretty good.   I recommend the closest alternate location at Tempe Marketplace, but service was not stellar on my last visit."}
{"text":"Giving it a 2-3 as it's a cool neighborhood spot to go to for shakes and dessert, but not a fan if the burgers. I've given it multiple tries but just don't think their good, would much rather have a fast food burger.  Service is good though and cute they have a burger challenge for kids."}
{"text":"First off, the place has a really cool 50's diner feel to it.  Lots of old posters, old time tables and pink neon lights running the top of the interior.  It would probably give me a headache if I had to work there, but only being in there for dinner made sure I didn't start hallucinating in pink.  The food was pretty good.  I got the patty melt which was good, but in my opinion, the burger was simply too thick.  You couldn't taste much of the other stuff on the burger because the taste of the beef overpowered it.  We also ordered loaded french fries which were good but was a little too much since the burgers were so big.  We had to get a shake though since we were in a diner and we weren't disappointed.  I got the strawberry banana one and my girlfriend got the birthday cake one.  Both were very tasty and mine had real chunks of strawberries and bananas.  I'll be back, but I'll make sure to order a smaller burger so I can enjoy the rest of the meal without feeling overly stuffed.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Awesome service.  Great food.  Had the 1 pounder  I'm a repeat offender.  Only because I had the 2 pounder twice and it hurt me."}
{"text":"Been to the Henderson location 3 times so far. I like the old school theme and décor, the staff is friendly.   The lag time to actually get the food seems a bit long but I prefer to think because it's made to order. The food is good, tons of appetizers, if you are a fried food junkie this could be your new heaven. I thought the fries were a little oily, but not too bad.  So many choices on the real milk shake menu, it is mind blowing :)...  I will defiantly go back, want to try Saturday night as it is juke box night."}
{"text":"I went here as part of a fundraiser for a club. The server was REALLY helpful and tolerant of our big crowd. (I think we took up 60-70% of the restaurant!). Not once did he show any sign of being annoyed or irritated because we'd have someone new join our party every 15 minutes or so. We also stayed 30 minutes past closing without knowing, and he did not rush us at all! Just the service alone gives this place 5 stars!  A few of us did the pounder challenge (where we eat the full pounder and get our picture taken and placed up on the wall). There are a LOT of different toppings to choose from, and a few premium ones as well. The burger was a bit messy to eat, but hey, what else do you expect from a one pound burger, right? The burger itself was delicious. The only complaint I have about it is the beef patty... It could have been seasoned a bit more, because there were times where I tasted nothing but beef. No seasoning on the inside, whatsoever, and the sauces I picked for my burger did not seem to reach my taste buds as I was munching down on the ginormous beef patty.  I would have ordered a shake for dessert, but I was pretty much bloated after the burger. I will DEFINITELY be back just to try out their shakes, cause judging from their menu, it seems like there are a lot of yummy combinations just waiting to explode in my mouth. =P"}
{"text":"Walking in I felt like I traveled back into time.. The 50's maybe? Awesome vibe. Totally made me want to sit and eat and enjoy the ambiance.  The burgers are delicious and juicy. Love that you can add as many topping as you want for free, except the special ones (bacon, guac, and egg, etc) free toppings include, onion rings, chipotle sauce, jalapeños, etc)  0f course my burger had a bunch of toppings and I got the classic burger, which is the smallest. It was good size and delicious. I decided on onion rings, grilled onions, lettuce, chipotle mayo, ranch dressing, bacon, jalapeños. Omg hit the spot. Spicy yet crunchy.  We order the mix basket of fries and onion rings. I found the fries to taste fresh, no frozen. Could use a little more salt and I didn't like that the onion rings were not very crunchy. They got chewy and were soggy compared to others I've had else where  The raspberry lemonade they have is delicious and I highly recommend it. Good bye soda! Wish I could get the recipe.  Customer service was good and attentive. Only problem was at the end when we asked him to split the bill and instead he put it all on one card."}
{"text":"As others have mentioned, the waitstaff aren't just rude, they seem really unhappy to be here. Love the food, but the staff needs an attitude overhaul."}
{"text":"1. Decor of a 50's diner.  2.  Riff raff clientele  3. Took forever to get waited on.  4. Another eon to get the food.  5. Young portly tattooed waiter obviously didn't know what he was doing.  6. Salad ordered by my wife.  How can you screw up a salad?  Well, some lettuce leaves had brown spots, that's how.  7. Sweet potato fries had been sitting for awhile before being served, kinda soggy.  8. Make up your own burger.  So I did, so maybe it was my fault it tasted like some fool had put it together.  9.  Is there a minus star rating?"}
{"text":"hi, I would agree, the Hamburger was awesome...i bought the 9.95 one.  I think it's probably a 1/4 pound of meat if not more, and added all the toppings i wanted, including Coleslaw! and worestire sauce. Well made, nice bun also.    Problem was with the Poutine my friend and I ordered. The fries were UNDERCOOKED - we sent them back and i'm sure they just maybe stuck the plate in the oven, and darkened the fries, but once again, they were raw on the inside as they were cold when you'd bite into them..and mushy inside.  We said forget it about them fries. I don't beileve there were curds on the poutine anyway, rather they used a white cheese instead.  The Milkshakes - i ordered peanut butter banana and my friend Double chocolate, we loved em and they serve them in the Steel mixing cups they make them in (tall cups)    I woudl recommend this place, and hopefully they improve their poutine, as you shouldn't have to send it back like that and if you do, it should be made right!  The restaruant is certainly PINK ...but it is a 50's diner like place, so it's a nice ambience, good change from what you see now a days....  thank you KC"}
{"text":"I wouldn't call that a burger... There was no flavor and ordering sautéed mushrooms (one of the few toppings they charge for) was a joke. There were hardly any mushrooms and the burger was actually smaller than the bun! The fries were hard they were cooked so long and the cheese sauce also had no flavor. It tasted like those cheap cans of eerily bright orange cheese sauce. Everything was just sitting in grease. There are plenty of burger places that make fantastic burgers... Try a different place!"}
{"text":"I have come to the conclusion that it is impossible to get good service ANYWHERE in Tempe. Here was no different. Me and my buddy sat outside because it was glorious out. It wouldn't have made much of a difference if I sat across the street. Our \"waitress\" (if thats what you want to call her) was a disaster. The food, however, was actually pretty tasty. I got one of the meal deal thingies that came with a burger, a salad, and fries or onion rings for $10.99 which was a good deal. The burger was really good and the onion rings were super crispy and delicious. I wasn't a fan of the salad but that's because I don't like olives. They also have a plethora of milkshakes to choose from and I was stoked to see that they had a mango one. I was a bit disappointed in the milkshake but like I said the food was pretty good so I'd probably eat there again."}
{"text":"Im giving this a four star rating bc although the service is on the slow side and the dining area is a bit cramped, the food was excellent. Its so hard to find a simple burger and shake joint and this is definitely on my list now. Im a very understanding person when it comes to dining out bc I work in the food industry, so I tend to cut waiters slack if they are polite and smiley, which our server was. It was PACKED on a tuesday around 6 and it was cramped inside, but I feel like if you eat out with people you like, being a little crowded doesnt matter too much. Our service was of course slow but they were very busy with large groups so it was understandable. Our waiter was very attentive and apologetic for the slow service. It was pretty good deal, 2 burgers (5 oz. And 10 oz.) A medium fry and large shake for 25 bucks. I will definitely be returning bc the food was awesome!!"}
{"text":"The burgers are really good there you can customize it anyway you want they also do a mad insane combination of milkshakes as well. i  recommend any one to try this place once and if you're daring try their burger challenge"}
{"text":"Wow.. I can't believe there's more than one of these bad boys. Two stars is very generous.   I don't often write reviews immediately after dining, but these gem deserves special attention. I went the original location years ago, and have no memory of what I had or how it was (clue #1). I've explored just about every restaurant near my job, and I was excited to try something new. I was expecting a fast food joint, but to my surprise I walked into a colorful 50s style diner.   Everything on the menu is a la carte, so I settled on a patty melt and medium fries. It took about 15 minutes to get our food which is decent for 12pm, however, I was completely underwhelmed. The patty melt was nearly tasteless and the fries were similar to Five Guys with less seasoning. It wasn't terrible, but for $8.99 (cost of the patty melt) I can get a complete meal up the street that I'd actually enjoy.   Skip this joint. Instead try Freddy's, Smashburger, Wendy's.. even McDonald's. Yup, it's that bad."}
{"text":"I like the idea of this family friendly place but weve been to better.  They are stingy with their fries.  The rest of the food was average, not an awesome guilty pleasure like these kinds of places usually are."}
{"text":"HOLY S WHY ARE THERE NOT MORE REVIEWS FOR THIS PLACE?!?!! IT IS AMAZING!!!! there are so many milkshakes but the only one you need to know about is the strawberry birthday cake. o the smoress is banging too. my buddy bruce and i we're going to try every flavor milkshake they have but we got through like 30 then i quit my job and we stopped tasting them. but i'll always remember bruce, i'll always remember. yeah they also have these killer onion rings and fries and they'll pile them all up in a big pile and you can eat them all while you drink your shakes. wow. cheeburger squared, you rule."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst burger place in Montreal.. Me and my boyfriend were extremely excited to try this chain brought to Canada for weeks only to be greatly disappointed. So we both ordered a burger with the best of both basket ( onion rings and fries ) and we were expecting something quite delicious , what we got was probably the greasiest , most soggiest , lackluster burger that we could have ever imagined.  The onion rings and fries were a soggy mess. You couldn't even tell that it was an onion ring. That's how sloppy and disgusting everything was. Besides that , just for 2 burgers with the basket of onion rings and fries it came to more than 30 $$.. You could get the same thing , but with actual taste at so many other places like Burger de Ville , or Burger Bar Crescent for less than 15 $. Not to mention they forgot to give us our 3 sauces that we paid almost 2 $ each for from takeout. Will not go back and honestly if any of you guys are thinking of going there , we would definitely recommend you to pass.    F-!!!"}
{"text":"I would the rate the food, but that would require an employee to help me. One was coloring on the door, and everyone else was non-existent. Good thing five guys is next door."}
{"text":"Cute 50's style diner. Cheesy fries were amaaazing. Free refills on their house made sodas and teas. Big juicy burgers. Definitely returning to try one of their milkshakes next time!"}
{"text":"Cheeburger after closing of one year is open again! With an excitement, I and my close friend went there to have lunch. We got there at 12.15pm. Ordered in 10 minutes. They told us that the waiting time is 15 min! We waited for about an hour!!!! the service was terrible! the server came back and apologized for being late and told us that it is coming. At 1.20, he came back with fries just trowed it and left! He brought dishes to the tables that came after us!!!!!! and ordered after us!!!! Before it got closed last year, we knew that service was always bad, but THIS TIME THEY MESSED UP BIG TIME!!!!!! after waiting for an hour we just got up and left!!!! if you want to treated like a decent customer, DO NOT GO THERE!!!!!!!!! WITH THIS SERVICE THEY WILL BE CLOSING AGAIN!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! The chicken is juicy, burgers are fantastic, and you can build your own anything."}
{"text":"well lets see. our service was pretty good. we were seated quickly and our order was taken almost immediately afterwards. my fiance and i ordered the same exact thing. medium well burger with garlic, jalapeno and thousand island dressing. anyways...when we got our burgers they ended up being rare. the stuff was just falling apart and to be quite honest...it was disgusting....however...the onion rings were damn good and so was my glass of water.  so having a crappy burger always sucks but to top things off an annoying customer comes in and decides to sit right buy us. this dude would not shut up! he had an aquarium tied around his neck and kept trying to push us to buy the contents inside. this dude was trying to sell baby turtles. apparently he had a bunch of turtles in his backpack as well. not only was he bothering us but he kept trying to get a trade...turtle for a burger. in my opinion when an employee of a restaurant sees this maybe they should say something. it was obvious to the employees that this guy was bothering their customers. anytime somebody would walk in the door he would approach them and try to get THEM to buy a turtle.....,oh god.....sorry about that. i forgot i was here to review the food. my bad. anyways...the food sucked...really bad...except for those rings and the tap water. i don't think i can ever eat there again."}
{"text":"I'm a little disappointed from this place.  It may have been because all the hype that could have ruined it but I will give them a try again later.  Basically, I came here on National Cheeseburger day and was excited to try this place out.  Unfortunately, the burger didn't have the \"x\" factor.  It tasted like a regular burger.  There were some positive points on this place.  POSITIVE: 1. Good size- it will get you full 2. Free toppings- 25 toppings you can  choose from  3. Nice staff 4. Onion Rings were good 5. Build your own burger  Negative: 1. No special sauce or distinctive taste that will want you to crave it later 2. French fries didn't match the burger.  It thick fries but just didn't go well with the burgers  3. Burger was not juicy   I will try them again just to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"I'm so happy you came into my life Cheeburger Cheeburger. I love me a good cheeburger, what do I love more than a cheeburger? A mik shak. Seriously, their shake list is a whose who in the milk shake world. Dozens of flavors and concoctions, so many to try, such little time! On my first trip to C-squared I went with the classic chocolate shake and was disappointed I only ordered a 1/2 size one. It was awesome, made with actual chocolate ice-cream. That's a rarity. I used to think Denny's had the best shakes, now I think this joint does. Well done!  As far as the cheeburger goes - good grief do you have options. 25 free toppings which includes things like jalapenos, onion rings, standard burger veggies, guacamole - oh ya, and they're all FREE. Free is for me. That's the motto I live by at least. I took advantage of a good 10 or so toppings, ordered a 1/3lb burger, and proceeded to house that SOB. Split an order of Fries/Onion Ring combo with my lovely lady, and called it a day.  This new location is located way too close to home. Writing this review makes me want to head back there for another burger, some onion rings, and about 7 chocolate shakes. What can I say? I love shakin' it up."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad burger here.  This is a place I can always count on.  The burgers are not greasy, which I thoroughly prefer.  The onion rings are addictive.  And while the meat isn't the most flavorful, the abundance of toppings certainly takes care of that!  A solid meal considering this is a chain."}
{"text":"We have been coming here since it opened.  Previously we went on Rainbow.  It started out so so.  Depending who waited on you made the difference in your meal being good or GREAT!  Well we found Alex.  She is hands down the reason my husband and I still come to this Cheeburger Cheeburger.  Alex listens and aims to please.  Alex goes above and beyond to make sure the experience is a pleasant one.  I would not still be coming had I not run into Alex.  Now we ask for her when we come.  Kudo's for hiring someone that knows the service industry so well and is so nice and efficient!  Thanks Alex!   Karen Belcore"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place, but was disappointed.  Forget the fact that the waiter screwed up my wife's burger by writing down the wrong order, it just wasn't that good.  They skimp on the toppings and we ordered our burgers medium (they ask you how you want it cooked) and they arrived well done.  Simply not very juicy.  Shake was fine, but arrived in a silver malt cup?....no glass?  You've got to be kidding.  They don't put any fresh mix ins into your shake, they are simply flavored from various bottles.  For example, I ordered chocolate Heath Bar almond and received an almond flavored chocolate shake, but had no almonds or Heath Bars in it!  WTF?  Save your time and money and go to In-N-Out.  You know they never get it wrong there."}
{"text":"The restaurant decor is 50's style. Clean and good service. Dozens of toppings for free but cheese is extra $0.50. The burger was cooked perfectly and tasted good but the meat to bun ratio was off. Basically more bread than meat. Overall, I feel it was kinda pricey but would come back. If I had a choice between here and In N Out I'd go to In N Out."}

{"text":"great burgers and shakes, cool 50s vibe. what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"They got a ton of milkshake options, but the burger is about average compared to other burger joints."}
{"text":"I've given this place its last chance at redemption. This place has gotten worst with the worst service. They have also limited their toppings options and charges for alot of tye sides. I've always thought the food was ok, not great. But this time it just got worst. I'm writing this review while sitting in their dinning room. It has been exactly 42 min and still do not have our food. No one has come to let us know what's going on with our food but everyone around has recieved their food and almost done eating. WTF! I understand that there's 7 of us but you can serve 4 people next to me and another 3 and 4 in front of me? If I can give this place a negative star I would. Not an apology and no one asked how we're doing. I saw them glance a couple times and they knew we were upset but didn't bother to come by.   You should see their area where they make shakes it was disgusting, they also have a red bucket placed where the pick window (see in picture) and register was at filled with dirty water and dirty rags that they use for wiping down the equipment and tables. Gross."}
{"text":"Probably the worst customer service I've received. A Caucasian bald male was extremely rude to a women,myself, and my girlfriend and had such a terrible attitude when we picked up his menu that was \"velcrowed down for a reason\" as he said because the older woman asked for a menu and he was busy. I will absolutely never go back or recommend this location to anyone which was a true disappointment because my girlfriend said good things about it."}
{"text":"The worst burger I have had in a long time. Took forever to get food. Quality was so bad. Ordered my burger medium and it came closer to resembling a hockey puck than food."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I just can't praise this place enough. The selection of free topping is extensive, you could create a different burger every visit. Plus a huge selection of different shake combinations. This place is awesome for kids as well. Mine love the fried mac-n-cheese wedges. The roll of paper towels on the table are necessary because you will get messy."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  My whole family loves the food.  The staff is always super friendly.  The service is usually remarkable."}
{"text":"At best a 2 star burger place.  I had a simple burger with no taste and it was over cooked.  The cost was higher than expected for a simple lunch.  Five guys is way better if you are going to spend this much money."}
{"text":"well .. dont be fooled by the appearance from the outside. it looks like a lodge, but once you pass the 4 doors you get to Cheeburger Cheeburger. once you enter its a 50's diner.  one you order i choose your size of beef then 1 cheese and then unlimited topings.  so u can make what ever u want.  for me the Hamburger was awesome. very juicy and tasty. fries were good and onion rings were better.   they even have a build your own sunday. too full to eat it but will go back.  IF YOU LIKE BURGER BAR IN MANDALAY BAY, then you will like this place BUT IT IS WAY CHEAPER."}
{"text":"We had previously been to Cheeburger Cheeburger a long time ago and when I saw the Groupon, I decided we'd pay it another visit.   We ordered: Basket with fries and onion rings Kid's meal with 3 chicken tenders, apple sauce, and apple juice The pounder with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, guacamole, bacon, and mayonnaise   The basket was brought out first so we pounced at the sight of it. The onion rings were completely demolished because they were delectable. The thing I hate most about onion rings is when you take one bite and the onion slides out of the batter, leaving you to feel like a fatty just eating the fried battered part of what used to be an onion ring. Not these! I easily bit right through the gluttonous batter and sweet onion every time.   The kid's meal was great. My 4 year old thought the fact that it came in a car was pretty amusing and the chicken tenders were large enough for my two children to share. It came with a side of ranch which I thought was quite tasty and admittedly dipped some onion rings in it when the kids weren't looking. We opted for the apple sauce which ended up being Mott's but I don't think children really care for flashy apple sauce anyway.    Now, my husband and I shared the pounder and we were very very full afterward. We ordered it cooked medium well which the server said would be a little pink, but unfortunately there was no pink. I thought it was still juicy but my husband said it was on the dry side. My issue with the burger was the meat to bun and toppings ratio. As a woman, I like to take my large servings of meat with some veggies, but there was just so much meat that it was making a toppings landslide out of my slightly soggy bun.   Overall, it was a nice experience but the price is a bit steep compared to how much I could pay at other burger places and receive a burger of equal quality."}
{"text":"These burgers are veeerrry good. I'm not a huge burger fanatic, but I thought it was delicious. I used a coupon from my Entertainment book here. They happily accepted. I loved the service here. I went around lunchtime on a weekday and got spoiled with attention.   Our shake, pineapple & pina colada, was... dreamy. My boyfriend doesn't like sweets, but he couldn't get enough of my shake! He almost drank it all. It was big enough for 2 to share. Without a coupon, you would probably spend about $10 per person, but not more than $15. I would go here again."}
{"text":"This reopened as JJ's Cheeburger.   I ordered a chipotle chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. It was hands down the best \"fast\" food I've ever had. The chicken was moist and tasted great. The bun was light a flaky from being toasted. The sweet potato fries were perfectly cooked and delicious.   This place is about 3 times as good as the previous Cheeburger Cheeburger. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place, salivating over their \"1 lb.\" (actually 20 oz.) burger after easy downing the 16 oz. stuffed burger at Gash House A Go Go, so perhaps my expectations were high.   First, the place gets dings for it's location. It's practically in the boonies, quite the haul from the Strip. It has to be a \"destination\" spot, and it doesn't quite rise to that level.   I had the above-mentioned burger, with fries & a raspberry lemonade. The drink is small, served in a mason jar, and is but \"flavored,\" not a raspberry in sight. No tang to it whatsoever. The fries were perry good, and the \"small\" is a vary good portion.  The burger looked impressive. I got just the basics. Lettuce, tomato, onion, & pickles. In my opinion, too many pickles, not enough onion. The bun was about the right size, but toasting it (a good thing) also left it a bit dried out, which meant it broke apart too easily. I ate far too much with my fork instead of my fingers. The burger itself was OK. A nice bit of crunch on the outside from the grill. It wasn't really thick and juicy, as I would have expected 20 oz. of ground beef to be.  Thing is, I want to go back. Not for the burgers, so much, as for some of the other menu items, especially the shakes.   The prices were decent for the amount you get."}
{"text":"Looking for a great burger, skip this place!  our burgers were hard, dry and crumbled apart.  The buns tasted stale and was also hard.  Lettuce was old and brown, the mayonnaise I was served also had clear crusty edges.  Onion rings were totally inedible, soggy, burnt, skinny, and very greasy!  (Nothing like what was pictured, gave us half off the basket of onion rings????)  Dinning room was dirty and the bathrooms were worst.  Mens room did not have paper towels available.  Had to walk back to the table to dry my hands.  Back to Mr Mamas for my burgers,  best in town!"}
{"text":"I've been here about 3 times and each were alright. Nothing amazing or outstanding. Because you customize your burger (cheese, toppings), there is quite a wait, especially if you're with a group. They also have malts and shakes and a great variety of flavors to mix and choose from.  My boyfriend and I enjoyed coming here because of all the great toppings you can choose for the burgers and all the flavors they have to offer for the malts and shakes. They also have the best onion rings ever.   My last experience here unfortunately was my last. We go inside and see that it's pretty busy compared to the other times we've been. The host tells us there will be about a 10-15 minute wait which I thought was odd because there were plenty of open tables. He informs the next customers that the kitchen was backed up and that's the reason for the wait. We patiently waited and were excited to finally get seated. As the host calls up a waiting party, he asks if they have been here before and they reply, \"Yes.\" The host lets out a big sigh and says, \"Oh good because I really don't want to give the big speech I would have to to newbies.\" Really? You'd say that to your customers? Show some excitement about your job.  There was a large group seated immediately after us who received quick attention and service. We waited 5 minutes, then 10, and it was finally 20 minutes later and not one person came to our table. The group ordered the drinks and food and received their drinks before we even had a chance to put in any order whatsoever. I had no more patience and we were getting ready to get up and leave. A waitress (who walked passed our table numerous times) notices us leaving and comes over to our table ready to take our order. I tell her we waited 20 minutes and she was the first person to finally approach our table but only after she realized we were leaving. She just simply says \"sorry\" and we left hungry, angry, and disappointed."}
{"text":"Just plain awful! I should have guessed the food was terrible when I walked in and the place was empty. There are advertisements all over the restaurant for \"kids eat for $1.00\" or \"lunch specials for $6.99.\" When you get your bill you find out these specials only apply between 1-2pm every other Wednesday in months that start with the letter \"A\" or something like that. The burgers are so nasty: over cooked on stale buns with little to no toppings. The fries and onion rings are disgusting: soggy and dropping grease. Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else."}
{"text":"How does this place only have three stars?! This was our first time trying it. It looks like a cute old diner! We got the three appetizer platter. The fried mushrooms were okay, the fried mac n cheese was heavenly, and the fried pickles were amazing! It was only $8 too! We got the Oreo cheesecake shake and it was delicious as well. I got the 3/4 patty and it was way bigger than I expected. It was so good and juicy. You get to pick what you want in it too. (: Sasha was an amazing server too!!! Will be back. (:"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I had in my life. The list of toppings you can add is more than I have ever seen. I had grilled onion rings, tomato, coleslaw, pickles, mayo and mustard on my burger. You can also create your own milkshake and your own salad. So glad my buddy turned me on to this place. Love the old diner feel. The wait for the food to be prepared was a bit too long in my opinion."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. 1 lb burger was huge but defintely worth it. I'll be sure to come back again."}
{"text":"SO MUCH FOOD!! Great service. Great smiles for all employees. They truly appreciated my business. A lot to say for a burger joint!   BTW- the food is AMAZING! Just make sure you don't come without an empty stomach!"}
{"text":"Im rewriting my review on this place for 2 reasons. First, because the first time I came here was back in 2009. Second, when I came here the most recent time, it was not like my first. Im gonna make this short and simple for you non readers. The burger was tasteless. I understand the reason for the unlimited amount of toppings you can add to your burger. But even A-1 steaksauce, chipotle sauce and banana peppers cant hide the taste of dry ground beef. Come on Cheeburger, even Chili's has their own flavor!!! I was very disappointed when I came back here, but im over it now since I wont be back again."}
{"text":"I am not one to turn down a challenge so when I saw that they offered a 1 lb burger challenge on the menu I obviously had to do it. The one pounder is a burger patty that is one pound after cooking which was a nice treat. The meat was cooked well and you are able to choose from a very ample list of free toppings. The patty was a little too greasy for my liking, and the bottom bun was soaked through by the time I finished. This location is not that close to where I live so it will probably not get a repeat visit, but I did get to take my picture with a giant plush hamburger after finishing the challenge so there's that."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite buger in town. I've been to Burger Bar, Fuddruckers, etc. but the meat, toppings, fries and rings, and shakes all make the grade here and cost a little less as well.   The fries/onion rings basket mix is a favorite to share between my boyfriend and I, and with the cheese sauce dip we couldn't ask for anything better. The other sauces were okay, we weren't too thrilled with them, but the fries and rings can stand on their own without the sauces so we're okay with just the cheese sauce.   The meat patty itself could also stand on its own, and it's always so fresh and tender that it still falls apart as you bite into it. You can actually taste the meat flavor in it, which I think is something of a rare find for burgers these days that are drenched in salt and sauces.  Not that I don't like those too, but this patty is definitely the kind that you savor and enjoy. Furthermore, the toppings are to die for and if I could have them all on my burger at once, I'd totally be game to try it just to see if it's physically possible.   The milkshakes, which I guess pretty much everyone else agrees with, were to die for and are customizable to your own taste. My boyfriend has gotten pretty good with the flavor experimenting and we've had everything from a chocolate-covered pretzel shake (which actually had crushed pretzels in it), to a birthday cake shake that forced images of an insane birthday clown into my mind. Fun, exciting, and dangerous if not controlled properly.   The reason why I'm giving this place 3 stars is because of the service. And from reading the previous reviews, I think I'm the only one who may feel this way. I don't know if it's just coincidence, bad luck, or bad timing, but it seems that everytime we pay Cheeburger Cheeburger a visit, the service we receive gets progressively worse and worse. It wasn't bad at first, and we're well aware that it takes at least 15 minutes for the food to come out because it's freshly made, but for one person's burger to come 30+minutes after the rest of our table's food has come out is ridiculous. So is the notorious lack of drink refills, the long waits in between giving the wait staff our check and getting it back, the forgotten drinks and other side orders, etc. I don't think that we're a very demanding table either, since I've worked in food service, and we're pretty frequent diners around town, but it really spoils the experience of the food when the service is bad. Which is really too bad, because I personally think Cheeburger has the best burgers in town hands down.   Sorry for the ranting at the end, but I hope that the service improves soon because I keep wanting to bring people back with me to show them the glory of the Cheeburger, but remembering about how bad the service was makes me think twice about doing so."}
{"text":"Its a decent place for lunch.   Many of my lunches working in this area the moose went here and consumed plenty of cheese burgers.   It is good, and the shakes were awesome.   I would recommend it before I would go to Friendly's or to 5 guys."}
{"text":"As soon as I checked in here I was tempted to go to the edit settings on my Yelp app to correct the spelling. Turns out that's how they wanted it.   First off, do not plan on eating here if you have any kind of time restraint. We came on a saturday afternoon at about 12:15. We were expecting it to be packed since it was lunch time but the place was about 40 percent full. So we were thinking we should have enough time to get to our 2 pm appointment. Well, it took about 10 minutes before our server came over to take our order. Since it was our first time, we had some questions to ensure our order was correct.  Since they are called Cheeburger Cheeburger, of course we were going to try their namesake. How it works is this. You select what size 100 percent angus beef patty. How you want it cooked (medium, medium well, or well). Pick your bun (honey wheat or kaiser roll). Pick your cheese (9 to choose from). Finally, pick your toppings (26 to choose from including peanut butter). Keep in mind that you can only have 1 of each topping and cheese for free. Any doubling there is an extra charge.  So I chose a 1/2 Pound Serious Burger ($7.99) cooked medium with pepper jack cheese on a kaiser roll. For the toppings I chose lettuce. tomatoes, onions, jalapenos, pineapple, roasted red peppers, and chipotle sauce. I also added bacon for 99 cents because it is not one of their free toppings. The taste? It was just decent. The beef patty itself didnt have too much flavor. Im glad the toppings I selected all went together really good flavorwise. I ordered the half pounder because I realized that the price was only for the burger. No sides at all. I should of ordered the next size down because we ended up ordering a fries/onion rings combo to go with it.  We got the medium sized Best of Both Basket (4.99) which feeds 2 to 3 people. This combination of fries and onion rings were just ok. The fries themselves were a little bit thicker than McDonalds fries but smaller than steak fries. The onion rings were really good. You can tell it was just freshly battered and deep fried because of the consistency of the crunch it produced. Dont forget you can add free toppings to these sides as well.  My wife and older son orderd the 1/3 Pound Semi Serious Burger ($6.99) and chose their options as well.  Service is pretty much the main reason why im giving them 3 stars. Everything seemed to take forever from the moment we received the menus. By the time we got the check to pay, it was already 1:30 so we had to leave right away.  Some random info:They also have wraps, sandwiches, and salads that the free toppings apply to as well not to mention milkshakes that you can create over 1,258,000 flavor combinations from. Hours are everyday 11 am to 9 pm. They just opened a new location in Anthem (Basically Henderson) off of Eastern and St. Rose Parkway. Their biggest patty is 1 pound (20 oz before cooking). If you finish all of that you get to have your picture taken and put on the wall.  Overall, the food here is decent but the really slow service needs some improvement. I can understand you cook everything from scratch since the place was only about 40 percent occupied, imagine having a full house. Then you definitely dont want to have any plans scheduled too close to a dining episode here. Im willing to try them again at a future date.  Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #195"}
{"text":"SO MANY SHAKE FLAVORS, OH MY GOD. It's like I died and went to liquidy ice cream heaven.   The burgers are very good for their price. The quality definitely beats some other retro diner-type places in town, ahem ahem. You can load on all sorts of great toppings, including banana peppers and onion rings. I imagine -someone- out there likes that particular combo, right?   Service can be a little slow, but it's in a mall, so I'm not really expecting stellar wait staff. No offense to the Cheeburger folks. I can understand the insanity since this place is usually packed with families, toddlers, and mall rats."}
{"text":"Perhaps the worst burger I've had in the history of dining out.  The Cleveland airport food offerings are bad to begin with, but my stars, I'd have been better with a Wendy's, McDonald's or BK burger.  This restaurant is located in the new food court that connects B terminal to C terminal directly across from Dunkin Donuts.  There's plenty of seating and the restaurant looks new, that's about the best of it.  I walk up to give a quick look at the menu and the employee behind the counter is already hounding me about my order.  I make a simple order.  Plane burger and fries.  How could they possibly mess this up?  Well they did.  The burger was nasty, it tasted as if it were frozen, then microwaved then thrown on the grill for two minutes.  The fries appeared ok, but were extremely greasy and served \"burn your mouth,\" hot.  When I go for a burger and fries I want a Coke.  Of course none of the food establishments serve Coke, and the only place you can get one is from airline catering or an airline club.  The shame of it is I tried this place only because they had closed BanJoe's Cafe, and I was trying to find an alternative.  Seems as if nothing will even come close."}
{"text":"So disappointed! After seeing their \"Voted Best Burger in Las Vegas\" sign, I decided to give them a try. I ordered the one person basket of fries with garlic and pepper salt and onion rings and a Veggie Burger to go. I only live about seven minutes away.  I took a picture of what the fries/onion rings looked like, and the veggie burger. Neither looked very appetizing.   The bun is huge, so unless you want to load up on carbs, you can just take 1/2 of it off. There was way too much onion thickly sliced on the burger, had to take those off too. The veggie burger itself tasted o.k. and was a descent size. They forgot to put the seasoning on my fries. The worst part was that my fries and onion rings were soggy! Yes soggy! Which means they came out of a warmer. The place wasn't even busy. Not like you need to keep fries and onion rings in a warming drawer!  There were only a couple of tables filled, at it was about 1:00 p.m.   Now for the $10.00 plus I spent, I should have gone to another place that I can rely on for fresh fries and onion rings. I will not be back."}
{"text":"50's Diner Style! Not the best burger I've had but the portions were big, prices are great and service was good. Plus: You can order as many toppings as you want and it's included in the burger price! Tons of shakes to choose from or make you own."}
{"text":"Great burger! Onion rings are excellent! Shakes are really good! Friendly staff. Sit down and order at table. Nice to be waited on."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and the last few times it's been a bit of a let down. It really took it from 4 stars to 3. The food is pretty good, compared to the first time I went (I thought it way better my first time) but the service was great. We checked in via Facebook and got 25% off our entire meal.  I would eat here again because the burgers were pretty spiffy."}
{"text":"I love going to Cheeburger Cheeburger and I've never been disappointed. The burgers are top shelf and shakes are awe-some. The beef is Angus 80\20, fresh and never frozen.  I've attempted duplicating them at home, but it just doesn't taste as good. The owner never fails to stop by the table for a quick hello whenever he's there and is always interested in feedback.  I just can't think of a single thing I don't like about this place; except maybe that I live so far from it. Thank you Cheeburger Cheeburger!"}
{"text":"Kitschy place with fun trivia cards at the tables. The setup is odd for a diner because I'm expecting lots of comfy booths. Instead, the layout is very cafeteria-like. The burgers here are decent but not on the top of my list when it comes to flavor. Their yummy onion rings and a great selection of milkshakes and malts are enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is weird in this place.  I get the 50's theme concept, but it feels poorly executed.  The decor is mis-matched and sparse.  The food - I found the menu overwhelming and confusing.  I settled on the patty melt, medium, with onion rings.  It was served as well-done as one could make a burger.  It was tough and over cooked.  The onions where thick sliced and not cooked enough so, instead of taking a bite and getting a little taste of all of the ingredients, I bit in and pulled off a string of onion that could not be bitten through. The flavor and seasoning was not special.  I can make a better burger at home.  Finally, the price.  A little under $15 for a crappy burger, greasy onion rings and a soda.  I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Since we just moved into the area and it did come so highly recommended by a coworker, we decided this would be the first new place we tried in our new neighborhood.  This little burger joint can be found on the east side of Rainbow, just south of Windmill Drive. It's kind of tucked away in there a bit, so you have to look out for it or you may miss it!  I do love the whole 50's Diner theme! It's a fun festive theme. It reminds me a lot of the 5 and Diner restaurant we used to go to as kids back in Phoenix back in the 80's (Do they even still have 5 and Diner locations open anywhere anymore??).  People here were very nice and friendly and the service was attentive. The young man who was our server was great about explaining everything and answering questions. After we received our food another lady stopped by and welcomed us and asked us how everything was going. We were pretty impressed with the service here from that standpoint.  I ordered a \"Semi-Serious Burger\", while my friend ordered a \"Serious Burger\".  We also decided to split a combo side of fries and onion rings. It is great how you can \"build your own burger\"! You have so many great options and combinations you can try! I had a pineapple on my burger!  Let me tell you, the burgers are pretty damn good! They were thick and juicy! The fries were thicker cut and not your standard generic  McDonalds/BK/JITB type fries. This is definitely a good thing! Onion rings were ginormous and pretty tasty as well!  The 2 big strikes against this place that drove us a little crazy was..  1) the service, while super nice, is painfully slllllooooooowwwwww...seriously, I thought they might have been killing the cow back there.  2) it is freezing in this place! It was like a meat locker in there! You realize it is November right now right?   This is yet another perfect example of when I wish Yelp! had a 3.5 star rating. That feels like the perfect rating for this place at this time. That being said we will definitely be back again soon and I can easily see this place bumping up to 4 stars pretty quickly.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"We went there last night, had an almond joy milkshake, which tasted terrible, we shared a half size and couldn't even drink it. The burger was ok, in n out makes a better burger for a lot cheaper."}
{"text":"I avoided this place like the plague because of its name.  I never thought the skit on SNL was funny.  It's just... I pictured some fat, wife beater-clad gentleman giggling about the name \"Cheeburger Cheeburger\" whilst wiping gravy about his chin.    I don't know why the mental image came into mind, but it grossed me out.  A few nights ago, I dropped into Tempe Marketplace to catch a movie.  I was also extremely hungry.  I bought my ticket and I was going to grab something to eat super quick, wolf it down and maybe die of a meat coma halfway through the flick.  I saw Cheeburger Cheeburger sort of looming out of the corner of my eye.  I sort of cringed because it's the worst name ever, but I wanted to try it out because I haven't had a decent cheeseburger in forever.  I thought it was gonna be a fast food kinda order, get in and leave type of thing but it was a sit down restaurant.  I had like twenty minutes before my movie started.  I was kinda like, \"Aw shit.  I'm gonna miss like the first five minutes of the movie probably.\"  The place was packed so I thought service was gonna be slow.  My food came quick and I made it to the movie like right in the nick of time.  It was awesome.  Service was awesome.  At first, it was a little surreal, because the hostess, like, went on this long, \"How to order...\" monologue and I zoned out because, man, I know how to order food.  I'm kind of a hick sometimes but I know how to order food.  Shit.  I didn't pay attention to her at all.    Basically, you build your own burger.  Fries aren't included.  Got it.  I built my own burger and it was pretty bomb.  I ordered one of about thirty TRILLION different kind of milkshakes they have.  That milkshake brought me close to orgasm.    The food was great.  The service was super awesome.  Considering how hectic and busy it was, it was great.  There was a mix up and I only got half an order on my milkshake, but I never would have known unless my waitress told me because it was already pretty huge.  She said she'd bring me the other half but I was like, \"Nah, this is already bordering gluttony.\"  If I'm in the neighborhood I'll pop in again."}
{"text":"I only write reviews when I really fall in love with places. This is probably my favorite place to dine. Everyone i go with says the same. It's delicious"}
{"text":"Not the best place to ever get a salad, burger nor chili cheese fries. I brought my mother and brother to have a nice lunch because someone recommended it but my gosh it was the worst burger place of all (I knew I should have went to Freddy's lol).   I asked my waitress for a salad that was physically chopped. It came to my table with whole lettuce. I didn't send back but I asked for a \"chopped\" salad. Now Martha the \"manager\" didn't know what chipped was. She brought a second salad and it looked the same.   It's very unfortunate that the so called \"manager\" that works in the food industry doesn't know what a chopped salad looks like. And I did show her a clear picture of what a chopped salad looks like online and she still didn't understand the instructions.   Maybe the owner needs to hire a new manager that has more knowledge on food. I will never come here again nor recommend this place! It's terrible!!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries. Pretty great burger customization. You can pretty much make any style burger you want. Fries were great too.  -Party Boy Esteban"}
{"text":"First one I've seen since living in Colorado so I was excited. Disappointment followed quickly.   Restaurant was empty besides the register employee friends so obviously I sat there for 20 minutes without anyone saying anything.  Once he came over he asked asinine questions. I think he may be a little slow.  Prices matched my spectacular service.    Ordered: Patty melt-$8.99 Large fry- 4.99 And an original shake-5.69  Total: $21.26  This place sucks. Stay away."}
{"text":"I was hoping to like this place. It was the second day open so maybe it will get better, the employees were very nice. The place was clean. The fries and rings were super greasy and tasted of just oil. The burger was bland the meat need some seasoning over all not happy spending $21 on a meal for two, that the wife and I were both unhappy with."}
{"text":"Delicious food and even awesome shakes!  A bit on the pricey side because everything is pretty much ala carte. Definitely delicious and worth a try. They have over 1000 milk shakes to choose from. Yummy."}
{"text":"Burgers are good, I like that I can choose as many toppings as I want, esp. when they have avocado! Haven't had their shakes yet, but I'm debating when I go next time. Fries, I can do without, although I havent tried their rings.   Again, I'd rather go to Four Peaks, but when I'm at the Marketplace, I guess this is better than eating at the overly expensive Paradise Bakery!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst tasting burger I've ever had in my life. The meat was bland, the chicken patty looked fake, and wasn't seasoned at all either. The seasoning on the table is the only good thing there."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to a new place I  heard that serves good burgers.  At the very beginning I knew I was not going to be happy with the service.  The server had to repeatedly asked how we ordered each of our burgers and fries.   Now  about the food one of the burgers only covered half of the bun on top of that was cold. They also had no flavor what so ever.  Took two bites and was done it was so small. The other burger that was the same size as my burger as ordered was twice as big and also cold.  My other friend ordered the pounder which is no bigger than any other large burgers in town and was very dry not cooked to order. All three of us also ordered french fries the fries came out cold and needed seasoning but in all the best thing they had.  I ordered the onion rings they were some of the best in town. We sat for nearly 15 minutes waiting to get our bill for our meal. Should have had it when we were done when the server cleared the table. Overall not happy with the place for what one gets all round."}
{"text":"Before I started on my journey of eating less meat, I would say I minored in finding the best hamburgers out there. So every once in a while when I wonder back on the meat path, hamburgers are my first choice. I have driven by this location often and decided to give it a try.  * It attempts to have a diner feel, but the decor feels like its trying way too hard to LOOK like a diner when it looks like someones garage with a collection of diner memorabilia. * It was a slow night and the server rushed us through the order even when I asked her numerous times to gives us a few minutes please. I think the entire experience from walking in to leaving was less than 25 minutes. *The basket of fried pickles was the highlight of my meal. *The hamburgers were a big old mess of ingredients most of which ended up in the basket, not in our mouths. My medium well burger was VERY pink. In my opinion, the meat and the bun lacked flavor so much so, that I would not return.  *$35 was the bill for 2 burgers, a basket of fried pickles, 2 small shakes, and 2 sodas. A bit overpriced in my burger meal experience."}
{"text":"I don't understand what all the fuss is about.  We ordered two burgers and both showed up incorrectly made.  While I appreciate that they are hand-cutting fries, and they were well seasoned and crispy on the outside, inside they were undercooked and raw.  The burgers, after they were remade, were flavorless, unshaped patties that more resembled meatloaf than hamburgers.  The toppings were of poor quality, and the final price tag - ridiculous.  I could have had seven #3's at the God-Squad burger shop for the same price  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Cheeburger is my go to burger shop, it's not too far from my house, and the food is pretty solid.  Where else can you get a burger with Eleventy Billion toppings, pretty solid O-rings, and a malt, served by friendly staff in a pretty timely manner?  The Best way to sum up Cheeburger is imagine if a Fuddruckers and a Malt Shop had a baby, that my friends is Cheeburger.  My only major complaint is that for a burger, o-rings, and a malt, the tab can be a little high, but the quality makes up for it.  There are probably a million different combos of toppings/sauces you can put on your burger, and they will custom blend any flavor of malt that you can dream up. They also have Eggcreams (my NY roommate said they were pretty damn good), and a few other delicacies that you can't get at many places in town.  If you're on the SW side of town and looking for a good burger fix, it's hard to do better than Cheeburger, and mad props if you do the 1lb burger!!!"}
{"text":"I love love love this place. So many options. I am a burger girl and i can't help but love this place.  I can't say enough about your topping options and that goes for more then their burgers. You can customize all sandwiches, wraps and salads.   Bring the kids or friends and enjoy the time out."}
{"text":"My parents love this place. They took a friend of mine and I here one evening after talking it up so much. I walked in and was definitely shocked my the decor. I was expecting some new, trendy place from the looks of the outside, but walking in feels like a time warp back into the golden olden days. +1 star for that. I felt like i was missing my little poodle skirt and wanted to dance around the jukebox. so much fun! I should probably start talking about the food, huh? I got the classic cheeseburger with swiss cheese, lettuce, pickles, guacamole, and onions. now you can choose as many toppings as you'd like. mix and match. whatever you fancy that day and they are free. FREE, i say! Now when my burger came out I was surprised at the size. For getting the small one i knew I would get full half way through. (i have no idea how my father finished the large one and got his picture on the wall. my stomach hurt just looking at it. food coma at its finest.) It was very messy and I had to eat it with a fork and knife. It worked out to my favor because i got to take the top bun off to get more flavor of the burger. I finished it all. It was a tasty burger. I shared a half order of fries and onion rings, but we should have just got all onion rings. addicting. the fries weren't anything special. The service was great. Everyone was friendly and funny. I enjoyed it and i'm sure I'll be back even if it is just to share a shake at the counter. (which by the way you can combine and all sorts of ways to wear you could go everyday for 5 years and still not have tried every single way. cool, huh?)"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a co-worker.  He had eaten here before and suggested that it was a pretty good burger, although a bit on the pricey side.  I thought it was worth the chance.    Points for:  Tasty onion rings, which came in a combo with their fries...free via a Yelp coupon.  Fries were fresh, but a bit over cooked and in so many random sizes it felt like we got the bottom of the batch.  Tons of topping options all at no additional charge, which was good, because the burgers were more than a bit pricey in my book.  Frequent refills on drinks, which was nice.  Points against:  Burger which was ordered \"Medium\", their least cooked option, was cooked to the consistency of shoe leather.  Not a good burger.  Bun, which I presume was special to their location, was stale.  We were one of four tables in the restaurant, and it was  quite a while before we were served our food...not sure what that is about...maybe that is how long it takes to cook the flavor and life out of a hamburger.  Overall two stars....there are lots of better options out there."}
{"text":"Everyone else has covered the burgers but I'm a shake fiend.  These are made from real ice cream in the stainless steel shake containers that are HUGE.  You can make any combo like amaretto + peanut butter +chocolate & no one bats an eye like how can you drink that...    The onion rings are ok, fries are standard, but if you don't have time to wait for your burger, don't come cuz the sign says they are not fast food."}
{"text":"Cheeburger Cheeburger is king of burger customization. Choose a meat patty (up to a pound in weight - yes, 20 ounces), then add any desired toppings from their HUGE toppings list.  I went for their Classic Cheeburger, cooked medium, made with American cheese, Worcestershire sauce, a pineapple slice, roasted red peppers, an onion, jalapeno peppers, sweet peppers, pepperoni, bacon, and lettuce. My Cheeburger was missing more than a \"SE\", unfortunately: while the patty was a good size, it wasn't that moist. The pineapple slice was cold and reminded me of Del Monte canned fruits (not something you'd put on a pizza). Not a fan of their bacon or crusty buns, either. It wasn't a horrible burger, just not a Five Guys or Ruby's creation[1].  On a more positive note, our server handled our group (eight people) without issue, seating us right away, and being polite throughout. You can't beat old-school fifties music, or decor. Did I mention that the half-sized, mint chocolate chip Edy's milkshake I got was a crazily sweet treat? It made lunch more bearable, for sure.  [1] If you dare, go for the Cheeburger Cheeburger challenge, where those who take down one of their pounders will get their photograph posted in the front. If my burger was an indicator, the challenge isn't worth it."}
{"text":"I don't love this place.  The burgers are just OK and the service is slow.  Once I went there and there were only 3 tables of people and it still took forever for service.  They do have all kinds of shakes to pick from and you can mix and match your own so thats cool.  It is a little pricey and the burger is big but nothing special and not real flavorful."}
{"text":"I hate giving out 1 star reviews but after tonight's event I just had to do it. We ordered take out from the restaurant through their website and was told that the food would be ready at 7:40. I arrived at the restaurant at around 7:45-7:50 only to find out that the order was not ready nor had it even been placed into the system by the young lady working the to go section. She said \"Oh, well we have to call you if it is over $30 dollars before we can put it into the system because that is the procedure.\" I looked at her and said \"well why didn't anyone call me since this is your procedure. Of course she didn't have an answer to such a simple question. She then said that she would put it into the system while I wanted. Now mind you that it took 30 minutes for the food to be ready in the first place so it was going to take another 30 or so minutes for the food to be ready. I said \"No thank you and walked out the door.\"  I feel bad for the other 5 faxes that were sitting in the machine. I hope that they got their phone call or spent less than 30 bucks.   I will have to say that we will not be dining with this restaurant again."}
{"text":"We've never been unhappy with our meals or service at Cheeburger. They boast not only a one pound burger, but you can also get a two or three pounder! They have more than 20 Free toppings for the burgers or salads, and over 1,285,000 flavor combinations for their awesome hand-dipped milkshakes and malts! Everything we order is always fantastic, and the service is terriffic!!!"}
{"text":"Walked at high noon and the place had 6 other patrons. Hostess explained the menu with the various options. Our server gave her name but couldn't comprehend or she didn't say it at all. The food was good. Burger was juicy, well seasoned but the bun was soggy and lacked toasted element. Order the onion rings over fries. The fries were greasy, old and warm. Over all it's a 3.5 although better service and acknowledging would have brought this to a full 4.0 stars."}
{"text":"Cheeburger Cheeburger is good, not awesome, but good. I am a fan but there were a few things I wish were just a bit better. Exhibit A: The 1 lb burger was not that impressive, I wanted to try to get it down so I could get my picture on the walls and in the little books, but I decided not to.  I was expecting a monstrosity of a burger and it was just a big piece. I've made bigger burgers on my grill at home and there were 10 year old kids posing for the pictures. If 10 year olds can knock that down, i'm not impressed! haha. Exhibit B: for a root beer float, they charged $5, and for a fountain drink, they charged $2.99. That's strip prices, and this isn't the strip, this is on rainbow in an area that I assume doesn't get that much traffic. But hey, power to em if they can continue to get people to pay it. It was a hot day (duh, it's vegas in late June) Wednesday and I got a RB float so i guess they got me!  The price was good for the amount of toppings they allowed. There were about 25 things you can add to your burger for no extra charge, including a bunch of veggies and sauces, and you could even add two onion rings to your burger. Bacon was an extra charge, I think it was about $2~  Mostly it was a great experience, and the 7 ounce burger was a perfect size with the order of fries we all split and the root beer float for me. I was happy and next time I'm craving a Cheeburger I might swing over to this spot.  3.5 stars, I'll round up cause the food was in fact good"}
{"text":"I give this rating for the chain.Sadly, this location is closed, I guess it was just a bad location, actually I know it was, because we only went there once in the past  2 years, when we went to the one in Maryland at least once a month. And we would have gone more, but calories are kinda real.  I Think the name put some people off, but those are folks who are to young to get the inside joke from the SNL skit. For us geezers, it was a \"hoot\"  If your ever in the mood for a GIANT burger, in a fun 50's atmosphere, is a better value than Johnny Rockets, and has AWESOME fried onions. I highly recommend this chain.  The burgers are grilled, not grilled, which is a downside to me, (and cost a star) but there are so many plus's to this chain, I forgive this. All the toppings are fresh, and a nice, big variety to choose from. Not to mention, you can be insane in the amount of topping you out on.  I guess around here in Phoenix, I'll have to give 5 guys a chance. Though I'm really in search of great onion strings/rings etc... I really liked the fact they let me get 1/2 fries and 1/2 onion straws...   Yeah, it's overpriced, it's that kind of overpriced place, for a good day to day burger, drive through in and out."}
{"text":"I really like this diner. I was surprised walking in. It's  very clean with oldies playing in the background. Alex met me at the door with a smile on her face. My server Stephenie was very friendly and made sure my drink was always full.  THE FOOD:  There are sooo many options I almost didn't know where to start. I had the fried pickles and artichoke hearts, they were great and cooked to perfection. I had the half pound burger. I really enjoyed it, although I think I will take advantage of the seasonings next time. The burger was cook correctly and was very juicy.  THE BAD: The only bad I can think of was the onion you have on the burger. It's a thick slice and I decided to remove it since it Co ered the taste of the burger.  I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a diner. I will be coming back here soon with friends and try the shakes next time."}
{"text":"WOW! I love this place because you can have your burger YOUR WAY! So much different options, you won't know what to put on your burger. Don't get me started on those shakes... There are about 81 different mix ins that you can choose from. So many different delicious ways you can make a milkshake.  I must say my creation was quite excellent: banana foster and heath. Simple, yet delicious. But mind you, you can choose as many mix ins as you want!!! Just try not to go crazy.  The service was also great. She was very patient with me because it took quite some time to actually  come up with a delicious burger concoction."}
{"text":"This place is the best burger place in town. I've eaten here more than enough times to catch every shift change, every waitress and every cook and all that I can say is that these cheeburgers are heaven sent. Some of these other reviews mention slow service, and  less than exceptional food. I must defend my favorite burger place by saying that the \"slow service\"  is to blame on your fresh not frozen made-to-order meat. If you go back to the cook's line, I guarantee you're not going to see a mass of pre-cooked burgers. It takes time to create perfection. If you don't have the know how to create your own perfect burger, then shame on you, not on Cheeburger for your less than exceptional food. As their menu states, there literally thousands of topping combinations and if you can't find ONE to suit you then that sounds to me like a personal problem. :)  As I was saying, there are tons of topping combinations to choose from, more than enough burger sizes- ranging from a measly 1/3 pound to 1 full pound of cooked beef. Speaking of 1 pounders- if you eat the whole thing you get your picture taken and put on the wall of fame for all to see. Pretty spiffy. (Look for my brother: a repeat offender) Top off your burger with unlimited FREE toppings- how can you go wrong? And, I think I'd be selling this place short if I weren't to mention their gigantic flavor menu for their shakes and malts, which are supreme. I've never tried any of their other menu items (there are quite a few choices other than burgers & fries), but I'm sure they are good too. The prices are justified for the serving sizes and phenomenal tastebud stimulation that you receive. If you want a burger, Pepsi and fries, all for $5 that's short on size, bland and pre-cooked- try Burger King; but good luck to you. To make this review a lot shorter than it should be, I will sum up by saying that if you don't try this place and eat a CHEESEBURGER (for which they are named) then you're not getting the full experience here.   Remember: \"Pepsi, Pepsi! No Coke!\""}
{"text":"Holy chee burger batman! This  place was the reciepent of constant ridicual as I would drive by for months but was brought there by a friend. Ridiculous name, RIDICULOUS BURGER! Huge burger with pretty much anything you can think to ask for can be put it on it. They don't even charge you per item which is what every other single place does. This place makes me hate those places because this place rocks the house and  leaves me wanting to drive 45 minutes back to it."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this tucked away burger joint for so many different reasons. For starters I have never had to wait to be seated, but once on a Friday night and I was glad to see them busy. This place is always clean and has friendly staff.   Cheeburger has a build your own burger/salad/chicken sandwich menus with toppings for days. They also offer veggie and turkey patties, too. I always opt for the smaller burger with bbq sauce, onion rings, cheddar cheese, bacon and a side of ranch. The flavor of the patty is what steals my heart. It has a black pepper flavor and not overwhelmingly salty like other places. One suggestion would be to ask them to cut it in half for you. Even the smallest burger is big! Now onto the onion rings and fries.......love, love, love. I always have to get the Best of Both basket which has both of them. The rings are crispy and light without being so oily. While the fries taste is simple and cooked to perfection. Don't forget to order the different sauces. My favorites other than plain ranch are the cheese sauce and the sweet chili sauce. Yum!!!! Now for my favorite thing on the menu. The shakes! Wow, you can order almost any combination of shake imaginable. I have sucked down a Rice Krispie Treat shake, Birthday Cake, Apple Pie Ala Mode, Mint Chip, etc. I would have to say I am now in a committed relationship with the Chocolate shake with M&Ms and caramel now:)  The food is delicious, service a bit slow, but well worth the wait when it all arrives. While waiting they have trivia cards on the table and bee bop 50's music to keep you happy. Every person I have taken here has been back and even brought their families since. Cheeburger is definitely in my Top Ten Favorite Places to Pig Out!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times before writing this review.  I love the restaurant next door, but sometimes you just want a good cheeseburger, you know?  Well, I have to admit, the first time I was here, it was great.  The second time, it was TERRIBLE.  The third time was pretty ok, maybe it could have been the company that helped.  The food is always great, its the service I find lacking.  It took almost 1 hour for me to get my meal.  1 hour?  I didnt even order fries!  *sigh*  The salad topping choices are awesome.  I have yet to have a milkshake.  Inconsistent service is a pet peeve."}
{"text":"Cute 50s diner style with a friendly staff and good service.  The menu says you can have as many toppings as you want on your burger. What I didn't realize was that having my onions grilled would cost an extra buck. The bun was soft and fresh. Meat was a little over cooked for my having ordered \"medium\" but it was still juicy.  Onion rings were awesome. French fries needed to be ordered well done. It's like In N' Out Burgers in that the potatoes are fresh but the fries ain't so good.  Bummer that each sauce you order for dipping is a buck.  All these little extra charges add up.  We basically got one cheeseburger, a small combo of fries and onion rings, a soda and a juice and our bill was $21 not including  tip. The 2 sauces and my grilled onions added some of that extra cost.  Although the meal was tasty, because of the price, I probably won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"My previous review was solely based on the takeout procedure and not the quality of the food or service because both are excellent. The burgers are very flavorful and I love the fries. The owner contacted me and appreciated my comments about the takeout packaging and said they are reviewing their takeout procedure so I know this will improve. Sometimes restaurants don't know there is a problem unless it is brought to their attention and this owner truly cares so I look forward to returning to eat more of their delicious burgers."}
{"text":"I had a friend on facebook post a picture of an awesome looking, juicy Cheeburger the other day and I very eagerly inquired: \"WHERE DO YOU GET A BURGER LIKE THAT?\"  To that she replied: Cheeburger Cheeburger.  I booked marked this into my phone and then the very next day I planned with my coworkers to try this place out.  The time came and we drove further than usual for lunch to try this place out.  I was so excited and so hungry, I could not wait to get one of those juicy burgers in my mouth!  What followed was deplorable.  Our party of 7 was greeted and seated promptly.   5 minutes later our drink order were taken.  5 minutes later our drinks were received. 5 minutes later our order were taken. 25 minutes later our food was brought out to our table.  We were starving.  We were in pain.  We were at the mercy of Cheeburger Cheeburger.  But they were relentless in their torture for us.  My friend ordered a Chicken Salad with the works and he was very full and loved his salad.  I ordered a Serious Burger on Honey Wheat Bun, Medium, with Swiss, Grilled Onion and Mushrooms, BACON, LETTUCE and TOMATO!  What I received was a a Semi-Serious Burger on Honey Wheat Bun, Medium Well, with Swiss, Grilled Mushrooms SANS BACON, LETTUCE AND TOMATO.  I was defeated.  I was hungry.  I couldn't complain for risk of my food disappearing another 5 minutes.  Instead after 40 minutes of waiting, our food was gone in 5.  I just ate it the way THEY wanted to and finished it quickly.  Our lunch time was running out.  We paid and left.  And we left unfulfilled and disappointed.  We were in awe of our let down.  We were taught a lesson never, ever to be this excited for food again...  Refills were sparse.  Food was good.  If only I got it MY way and if only I had more refills and if only food could've came out faster.   When we got there, there were only 3 other tables sat. And two of them already had their food.  Were they short-staffed?    Anyway, this place was decided that it's good \"on occasion\" when we have extra time.  Other than that, this place can't be a frequent lunch joint for us.  Cheeburger Cheeburger, what happened this Thursday during lunch? :("}
{"text":"Had a groupon for this place so decided to give it a try....  Pros: I really like the idea of having so many options! Honestly your dining experience is solely at your discretion...the toppings you choose make it so! I love the fries! They are homemade which I like a lot. The atmosphere is a lot of fun! Retro 50's diner, trivial pursuit cards at the table while you wait.... fun!  Cons: Pricey! For a burger joint I think the prices are a bit steep. And although the burgers weren't bad... I wouldn't say they were great either. I have had better....  All in all not a bad place to check out occasionally...."}
{"text":"Nice clean restaurant with some good old fashioned hamburgers! Younger topics what's on it! I had mushrooms and onions s d coleslaw at no extra charge! The best onion rings I have had in a long time! Very light and tasty! Will come back again!"}
{"text":"So, we're sitting home on a random Monday night trying to figure out what to eat. Every single day of my life I pass Cheeburger Cheeburger and laugh at the name. I figured it was like Chili's or Buffalo Wild Wings; turns out it's closer to a Johnny Rockets or an In N Out Burger!  I walked in and immediately noticed the \"wall of achievers\" to my direct right. Turns out there's an eating challenge here. Turns out that challenge is a one pound burger. Easy. So easy.  My friends all got a shake to start with, and in retrospect, I could have also. However, I decided to forgo the shake and just do the pounder. I ate the 1 pound burger (to which I added bacon) in under 5 minutes. Hardly a challenge. I also ate the fries, onion rings, and finished 3 diet cokes. I hadn't eaten all day. I ate like a champion. They took my picture, made me sign a waiver, and I contemplated another hamburger. I wanted to tack my picture onto the kid's Wall of Fame, but they wouldn't let me since I'm over 18.  I think at this point in the story it is important to note that I shaved all of my facial hair except for my pedo-stache. My picture at Cheeburger Cheeburger has me making a ridiculous face with a pedo stache and a stuffed hamburger. I've never been more proud in my life.  Back to the food; you can customize your burger with tons o' shit. It's like a slightly (better?) Fuddruckers. I felt like there were more topping options. The shakes looked scrumptious. The shake of the day was a frozen oreo hot chocolate; I tasted it and almost slipped into a coma.  I'm really glad I came here, and I'm going to go back so I can tackle the pounder again. I'm going to see if they'll make a new challenge with two pounders. THAT would be tough. They should name it the Burger Boner Bonanza."}
{"text":"Cheeburger Cheeburger is a 50's themed diner.   Think pink neon, 50's music, big burgers, big shakes, big fries and high blood pressure for all.  Take some fish oil or something afterwards and you'll be fine.  Get your burger for 6 for the quarter pounder, up to 10 for the full pounder.  Comes with cheese and all the fixings you want save for the premiums like bacon.  I got bleu cheese and chopped garlic.  They have 20 some odd toppings.  Go nuts.  If you are a shake enthusiast, then get your oreo cookie, mint and mango juice or whatever floats your boat.  They have over 300,000 combinations.  If you are a math geek, you can check the calcuation while you are waiting for your burger.  30 minutes or so on a good day.  They make everything to order and from scratch.  I didn't ask, but the ground beef was about of 15% fat quality, much better than the 30% more places, even supposedly high end places use.  Fries were from whole potatoes, so skin and tiny leftover crunchies galore.  The closest competitor might be Fuddruckers, though I haven't been to one of those in ages.  To sum, good place for burger and shake enthusiasts with a little time to kill.  If you think a big mac is the bees knees, this place is a total waste of time for you."}
{"text":"A new fav in Vegas...this was the best burger I have had in a very long time. Thank you."}
{"text":"This burgers here are great....at being inconsistent.  I thought the burger I ate my first visit here was the best burger I've ever eaten.  Unfortunately, subsequent visits made me rethink my sobriety during my first visit.  I've had burgers that were overcooked, undercooked, greasy, dry, too thick, or too thin. Burgers are never the same.  The one thing they're consistent at is service.  It sucks.  At all times of the day, every day of the week.  This last time we had to wait almost 10 minutes after we were seated to get our drink orders taken, and we were the only customers in the place!  That was the last time I go there, that's for sure.  They have a large selection of milkshakes.  So they've got that going for them, which is nice."}
{"text":"Kids love it  Good burgers and shakes Staff is super nice and they cater to kids"}
{"text":"I've heard about this place for awhile... mainly the shakes. The feel is totally one of a 50's dinner or so.     I came into town and me and my brother decided to try it out... out waitress was awesome,  gave us the low down and had a few laughs. I really like when a waitress /waiter can joke and laugh and make the evening entertaining.   The have a ton of shakes to choose from, I got the chocolate pretzel  and it was delicious!  The burger was just ok. They do offer many side to add to your burger but I've had better. I'd definitely come again, but settle for the more normal  burger add ons."}
{"text":"Ten.  Ten dollar.  Ten dollar burger combo.  The upside is that the burger was better than expected:  The patty was thicker than what you would get at a Wendy's or a McDonald's, but the good news stops there.  While the burger is okay, its not nearly worth the $10 they charge for the most basic combo.  The fries are greasy and soggy.  The wait for the food is entirely too long for an airport (where, more often than not, you're in a bit of a rush), and the folks working the counter have no interest in making your Cheeburger Cheeburger experience either quick or pleasant.  Sadly, this place makes me miss the Burger King that used to be in the main terminal food court area.  I'd even go for the old Manchu Wok with the Chinese food that had been sitting there for hours and hours.  If Hudson News sold those sandwiches encased in plastic triangles, it would be a superior option."}
{"text":"Harry would have never survived a meal at this place with Sally!  My friend and I stopped in here after a movie and I have to say this is one chain that I would whole heartedly recommend to anyone, with the possible exception of people with ADD. I'm not sure they could deal with all the choices on the menu!  We were quickly seated and our server gave us a quick menu 101 lesson (starters here... sauces here... burgers and salads over here... one gazillion toppings and combinations over here, etc). I could have taken 20 minutes vacillating over my selections, but my friend was growing impatient, so I plunged in for their small burger with blue cheese, grilled onions, mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, and a side of barbecue. Generally I like my burgers medium-rare, but medium is as low as you can go and in reality, their medium is more on the MR side so I was happy.  We split the Frings and for my shake I chose to combine the Chocolate Chocolate with White Chocolate Raspberry.  There was a bit of a wait for the meal, but our server was very attentive and let us know as progress was being made. Considering that there were no free tables either inside or out, the wait wasn't really that bad.  When the food arrived I was in burger heaven. Yes, yes, yes this place would likely win the award for most non-healthy option, but when the juices started working their way down my arm and then one perfect drop plopped on to my right breast (ever so slightly exposed in one of those trendy little numbers) my first thought was literally to try and lick it off. Quickly assessing the age of the children at the next table, I decided that probably wasn't the most appropriate response. Sadly I daubed the little drop away... And thankfully, each table has their own role of paper towels, so there was no need to bother our server with a pesky request for additional nappies!  The shakes were heavenly, the fries were twice fried (as all good fries should be), and the onion rings were some of the best I've ever had.  They have a great web order system that I checked out as soon as I got home, but parking is so unbelievably unavailable at the Tempe Marketplace that I'm not sure this \"run in and grab it\" approach will really be of much use at this location.  You can definately get in and out for under $10/person, but if you are going for sides and a shake, it will run you $13 and up, depending on the size of burger and drink. Considering the other options for burgers at TMP, I would strongly recommend piecing together a paper towel suit of armor and diving in to Cheeseburger Cheeseburger!"}
{"text":"I am a burger snob. You can imagine the delight when they have a place named for what you love!   Cheeburger was good. I liked the options but really didn't go wild. I like em standard. pickles, mayo, tomato, mustard, lettuce. and of course cheese. I asked for Medium since they don't to Med rare....   The 1/2 lb burger was cooked as requested (sort of) and was a good size. It came with the correct toppings and the cheese, cheddar jack, was melted perfectly.   3 problems   1x The burger was 2x the size of the bun. Equal it out a little....  2x They flat top grill it. Grill would have been awesome  3x It lacked seasoning, like garlic, onion powder,salt and pepper. I added it once it go to me and it was better.   I would have another burger from here but will not be craving it."}
{"text":"Since I first started seeing the sign for the grand opening of Cheeburger Cheeburger, I was curious to try out this American burger chain in its first imported restaurant to Canada. What you also need to know is that burgers are really my favourite meal so when a friend of mine agreed to join me to try this place out, needless to say, I was quite excited.   The decor was mentioned in most of the reviews I read so I won't bore you with the hot pink walls, cardboard cutouts of old cars and such. I will focus on the food instead and the main reason I wasn't able to give Cheeburger 5 stars.  I ordered with 1/3 pound burger and was very pleased with both the patty and bun. It was hard for me to choose my toppings, so I might have overdone it in that respect. Next time, I will make sure to keep the toppings simple in order for me to enjoy the patty, bread and cheese a little more. As the saying goes, sometimes too much is just not enough. We got to try both the fries and onion rings and I enjoyed both, even though I'm not a huge onion ring fan. The batter on the onion rings was crunchy and tasty and the fries were also very good, although just a little too salty.  All in all, I was very satisfied with Cheeburger Cheeburger, but the one thing that stops me from giving this burger joint 5 stars is the price. A burger, fries/onion ring combo basket, soft drink and small milk shake and I ended up paying 30$. Somehow I feel like I just got screwed by inflation. I'm at a 50s style dinner, yet I'm paying 30$ for my meal; it just didn't feel right. I don't expect to pay 50s prices, but something in the 15-20$ range would be better."}
{"text":"Everyone has their own experiences with this place obviously. I think this place is the kind of restaurant that you really have to catch it on a good day to have a great meal.  Pros- about 5 sizes of burgers to choose from,            an array of free toppings,            a gazillion milkshake flavors,            awesome onion rings (when they are fresh and not soggy)  Cons- super slow service,             over priced burgers ( but load up on toppings and it'll make up for it)             tasteless burger patty (no seasoning whatsoever)             did I mention slow service????  Between the 2 of us we had.... The 1 pounder (which I finished)  The 3/4 pounder Large basket of fries and onion rings 2 drinks  I had a $14 Groupon and I still ended up paying $33 + tip. Unfortunately i still have another groupon to use and I dont want to waste it. If I didn't then I wouldn't see myself going back."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the service, almost always, sucks.  Now that I've got that out of the way, I'll say that I will ALWAYS go back for the burgers.  If you can dream it, they can build it.  The combinations of toppings are endless and the quality is always good.  I love, love, love the dreamy burgers.  So much so, that I can't think of anything else to say. mmmmmm cheeburger."}
{"text":"Came here for a fundraiser, which was very nice of them to do for a non-profit organization. They donated 15% of the bill if you presented the flier with the bill.   Needless to say this was my first time here. Overall it was okay, I ended up getting regular order of half fries and half onion rings (\"bob\"), everyone had mix reviews about them so I decided to try both, along with the horseradish sauce which was recommended by the server. They were both just okay, I wasn't a big fan of either. They were also very oily which wasn't settling with me very well. The sauce was kind of bland, lacking in flavoring so I wasn't a fan of it either. Ended up using ketchup and a lot of seasoning instead.   I also got a shake, which I loved the idea of mixing whichever flavor I wanted into the shake. I ended up getting a mango and pineapple shake, which was good. It wasn't overly sweat so I was happy with my selection. My friend got a oreo, cookie dough, and white chocolate shake which was a lot sweeter, but good.   Prices were okay, about $6 for a regular size shake, $4 for a small, $20 2 lbs burger, $12 1 lbs burger, $10 dinner special (1/3 lbs burger with drink and fries), $6 regular order \"bob\".   I may or may not try a burger next time. There was a weird smell that really made me feel nauseous when all the burgers came out. The most potent one was from the 2lb burger, I wasn't around the 1lb burgers that a lot of my friends ended up getting but some people said those smelled. Someone thought it was the cheese but I don't believe it was. It smelled more like rotten meat to me.   I might be just overly sensitive to smell though, so it could be just me. I do like there shakes so I will come back for another shake, the food, I may or may not try.   Also a check-in will get you 1/2 order of \"bob\" free with a burger!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!! Who would've thought the best burgers are at Cheeburger Cheeburger?!?!  The employees here are awesome and funny, the atmosphere here is great!!   Who would've thought that you can customize your burger, wrap, salads and sandwiches so many different ways!! Their are over 8,721,000 burger combinations!   If your a sauce person like myself...hands down, you have to try the Creamy Jalapeño and the Chipotle Mayo...both are scrumdiddlyumptious!! Don't get me wrong...all of the sauces they have are great but those 2 stood out the most!!   Onto the shakes....oy vey...their are over 1,285,000 flavor combinations!!   I will definitely come back to Cheeburger Cheeburger, hands down...BEST BURGERS I've ever had!!!!"}
{"text":"It feels like a programmer designed the menus.  Let me explain.  Order a burger, and add any combination of 30+ different toppings (most of them free to add). You want a salad?  They have a serious combination of You want a shake?  20+ options in any combination, you think of it, they have it.  Really wish they had a working website so I could link to it.  You select whatever inputs you can think of and 8-10 minutes later the output is something amazing.  If you're an indecisive person, I wouldn't come here. If you like surprises, I wonder if you could come here and tell them \"you decide\"."}
{"text":"Cheeburger Cheeburger isn't really about burgers and shakes, it's about the experience of being bathed in neon pink lighting surrounded by stuffed burgers.  I've passed this place probably 100 times and always make fun of the name and talk about how much I want to eat there. After the 101st fit of laughter a few friends and I decided to see what all the hype was about.  Holy shit do they have a lot of options. Luckily our waitress could tell how clueless we were and walked us through the overly complicated menu with its millions of combinations and options. Fellow Yelper Seth Y. completed the pound burger challenge in under 5 minutes and I felt like a wuss with my half pounder. I guess I have to return for a crack at glory(and my beautiful face on the wall of fame!).  As I mentioned, this place is definitely about the atmosphere. They make a big ordeal about people finishing the challenge including ringing a bell and taking a picture with a giant, stuffed burger. The atmosphere is definitely one of a fantastic burger joint and the shake/burger options are plentiful enough that not even the fattest fatty could try every combination even if they tried.   All I know is that I will definitely think less about the goofy name when I drive by next time and more about the creepy pedo-stache picture of Seth Y. hanging on the wall of fame. Next time it'll be my beaming smile up there in all its glory!"}
{"text":"First time visitor.  Chocolate Malt is fantastic and burgers are amazing. Raynalyn wait our server.  Nothing but smiles and great service.  We WILL be back."}
{"text":"I understand that this is not fast food. So when the clerk says it will be 10-12 minutes when we pay, I'd expect for it to be something comparable. There were two orders in front of me, after all. 30 minutes later... No apology, just hand us our food like that's what to expect the next time. This is acceptable to them? Horrible.   The burger itself was so good. Perfectly cooked. Onion rings were great!"}
{"text":"Good burgers, lots of options. Maybe TOO many. There's quite literally about 10,000 different possible burger combinations to make here, and for an indecisive person like i can be at times, this is a nightmare.   At a point, i feel like im eating out for the restaurant to just tell me what's good in the form of a few options on the menu... the shtick here basically is they give you a list of what they have in the kitchen and they let you do all the rest... interesting concept if you have a really specific idea of what you want.   Other than that, nothing terribly impressive, but also not bad. Worth checking out at least once."}
{"text":"I was so very underwhelmed with this burger place. The decor was very retro and I was excited to try another \"build you own\" burger joint. The menu was simple, although a little on the spendy side. I was OK with the price being a little high if the food was worth it. My wife and I each ordered a \"classic\" 1/4 pound burger (the cheapest burger on the menu) and a basket of sweet potato fries. I had an iced tea and my wife had an Oreo cookie shake. Our total bill was $28.00.  They should rename the classic burger, \"Meatball sandwich.\" They used the same size bun for the smallest burger and the large 1lb burger. My burger patty was the size of a meatball. Spherical, not flat, so there was a lot of bites of just bread and toppings. Both my wife and I were truly disappointed. The fries were good and my wife really enjoyed her milkshake.  My other complaint was the complete lack of atmosphere. There was a group of 6 adults behind me that were loud, rude, and obnoxious. They were so loud, I could not hear what my wife was saying. Not only were they loud, they were swearing every other word. This happens, I understand, but any waitress, owner, or manager worth their weight in cheese would have asked the group to CHILL OUT! With the great amount of burger joints in town, cheaper and better, I'm positive I will not return to Cheeburger Cheeburger."}
{"text":"The decor of the place is a 50s dinner that in my opinion could use a little revamping. That is about the only negative I could find. Our waiter was prompt and after inquiring if this was our first time explained the menu to us. We both went with the make your own burgers which were delicious!! Better than Five guys and In n out by a landslide. They were also not greasey like other burgers which i loved. We will defiantly come back if not for burgers the make your own salad we saw the ladies next to us have looked mouth watering."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good burger and your in the area head down to Cheeburger Cheeburger.  The combinations of are limitless!! You can customize your burger however you want!  one thing I like about this place is when I asked for jalapenos on my burger they actually used fresh cut jalapenos instead of the canned ones which I have had at a couple different places i will not name lol.  Also if you love Milkshakes this is probably one of the best places you can get you fix at.  with over 20+ flavors of shakes which can also be made into malts if your heart desires.  My personal favorite was the Oreo Cheesecake shake, man that was delicious!!  The staff was really friendly and had catering to every need.  Definitely a fun place to go with friends or family for lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"Watered down milkshakes, the place smells like the nail salon next door, Egg Cream was EXTREMELY small along with too much soda. Liked the fry seasoning but they were under cooked.  Long wait time for our food. Given the burger competition on Eastern Ave., the space will be vacant by Summer."}
{"text":"Love the Burgers and home made Milkshakes I usually ride around after taking my Motorcycle through Red Rock. Wish they would build on the North end of Vegas"}
{"text":"I am surprised so many people like this place.  My family and I went last July and we swore we would never go back.  The burgers were dry, the food was overpriced, and the service could have only been worse if I had been verbally accosted and then burned by a grease fire.  I even tried writing to corporate to complain about the experience.  I got a reply from the local store asking about the problem but after I gave details of the experience I never heard back from them again.    I truly can not believe Cheeburger can stay in business with a Red Robin in the same parking lot."}
{"text":"For a place that focuses on burgers, theirs are pretty uninspired and may be slightly overpriced for the quality. The burger was sloppily put together and the bun was obviously not fresh. There are quite a few fast casual burger options, so they need to step up the game a bit in terms of preparation and presentation to compete with even a place like Smash Burger.   I gave an extra star for the fried mushrooms which had an almost tempura like batter. A little on the chewy side rather than crispy, but still better than average and the jalapeño ranch sauce was the perfect spicy!   I'm not sure what brand ice cream they use, but it was just ok. I've definitely had better shakes at fast food places like Braums or even Whataburger."}
{"text":"I definitely LOVE their food and the environment. Every so often, you'll get a waitress that isn't too friendly, but most of the time, everyone there is wonderful. It's a great little burger place to take your whole family!"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd visit here, but my first time ordering a burger.  Well I thought the girl that was taking my order was listening.  Maybe because she had such a big order before us she wasn't thinking.  But I ordered the simi serious burger with tomatoes, lettuce, onions, fresh Jalapenos and guacamole, 1000 dressing, and spicy seasoning! (hubby got the serious burger) Welp, got waxed peppers instead of jalapenos, and no guacamole.  I don't even think they put the spicy seasoning on it.  This burger was so bland!  I'm glad we brought it home.  I had to bust out with my own seasonings to make it taste ok!  So 2 burgers, and 2 med onion rings $35.00  It wasn't worth it!  Not even a drink for that price.  There onion rings are really good though.  you can order 1 med.  And share it with 2 people.  I don't see me going back there for a burger.  I might try the salad.......Depends on the price!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Highly recommend this spot if you are looking for a burger experience out of the ordinary.  To start with,  they have about 25-30 different shakes to start off...and they come in half sizes so it won't fill you up.  You get to build your own burger with about 25-30 different options. ..no extra charge!  We ordered the combo fry/onion rings basket which was as good as everything else.  As for the staff, super friendly!  They have only been open a week, so get here and beat the rush that is sure to ensue!"}
{"text":"bite number one of the veggie burger was reminiscent of hospital cafeteria food, mostly because it was the same veggie burger I have had in..... a hospital cafeteria.  fries, the same thing everyone else gets in an industrial-sized freezer bag.  and the whole 'retro burger joint' is just as flat as the food.  epitome of 'Meh'"}
{"text":"We hurried next door cause we were hella hungry and needed to get away from the dirty mop bucket smell.  The concept is cool here-customized burgers and shakes with tons of choices to have it your way with one exception. If you like pink in your meat, that ain't gonna happen.  Medium is the lowest they can go. The beef itself was good though, but the bun was very questionable-very nicely toasted but cold???

{"text":"Had better expectations for this place, driving by it, it sounded pretty good. The burger patties lack seasoning, like zero seasoning!!! the buns needed a little heating up too. The French fries are those fresh cut types, well seasoned, the onions rings are tasty but a bit sweet.  They do have a burger, drink and/or fries, onion rings for $9.99. Pretty good deal for during the week."}

You can add almost anything to your burgers and the variety of milkshakes are intimidating yet exciting!!"}

{"text":"Although I''m reluctant to go to a theme restaurant inspired by an SNL sketch I found cheeburger cheeburger to be better than a theme restaurant with mediocre food, I was here once before when Tempe marketplace first opened and was overwhelmed by the topping choices Think last time I had a burger with feta, mushrooms, and olives trying to imagine a Mediterranean    burger, really what ended up happening was flavor overload that I couldn't really taste the burger so I decided to give them another try, this time around I got 1/2 lbs burger (sorry a pound is just too much food) with cheddar jack, bacon and sauteed mushrooms, we ordered a half order of the \"best of both worlds\" which is a basket of fries and onion rings with a side of cheese , the fries are good very crispy well seasoned and appear to be fresh cut  or at least a very convincing fake, the onions rings are very crispy with a light batter that almost takes on a yellow tone, my burger was well prepared they use sliced whole mushrooms instead of pre sliced, the bacon was crispy and the cheese was nice and gooey, so all in all it was a pretty decent burger, I must say my burger was a bit greasy I cut my burger in half to eat it and by the time I moved on to the second half  my lower bun had become one and fused with my burger patty  Overall my experience was good, and I would go back but I don't see it being a frequent choice and not just due to distance, the main attraction seems to be the wide variety of burger toppings and the build-your-own inspired menu, despite the food being consistent and good it's nothing I haven't tasted before, though if I ever get the urge for a pepperoni, peanut butter, coleslaw, Sri racha burger, I can sleep easier at night knowing I've now got that issue handled"}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about this place..so let me start with the only thing I don't care for..the fries..theyure the only thing that rates a \"meh\". They're skinny like McDonalds fries but not golden or crispy...does that help? Anyway other than that SCORE! The shake choices are extensive and freakin delicious. Yesterday i had the Blackberry Cobbler one and it was excellent. I managed to suck down the whole thing before my \"My Bleu Chicken\" showed up. There's nothing wrong with dessert first right? The chicken was sooo tender. That is the 3rd time Ive been and before I had a build your own burger and a build your own grilled cheese. You just can't go wrong here! There is something for everyone! Service is great and fast and food is delicious.. what more do you need?"}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place out because I saw my friend post a photo on instagram.  When I walked in, it was a cute little 50's theme joint.  Very clean.  Service:  It was pretty quick for a not fast food joint.  The staff was really nice and helpful.    Food:  The food was ok.  I wouldn't come back out of my way to eat here again.  It was pretty pricey for everything we ordered.  We had to pay for our sauces too which I thought was ridiculous.  The shakes were pretty good that I wouldn't mind getting again."}
{"text":"C'etait bien en général! En ce qui concerne les laits frappés mmm, pas de déception. Beaucoup de choix et très bon dans la bouche! Le burger était bon, mais sans plus . Les frites un peu dècevantes, mais les rondelles d'onions etaient délicieuses. Le choix des condiments, pains, fromages et sauces est très varié, on peut littéralement construire son burger personnel. Le menu est invitant, il y a aussi des salades et desserts aux choix. L'ambiance ressemble un peu au Nickels. Si vous etes au cours mont-royal pour du shopping, ca vaut le detour, si non ca reste une question de goût. Prix très abordable!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to purchase a freshly made burger and a traditional malt or shake.  Ambience: Very clean and personal touch with escorted seating. They also use real flatware instead of plastic, big time plus. Paper towel rolls instead napkins makes for easy clean-up and those people that love to ask for extra napkins. Overall a nice blend of happy days diner meet modern world. One large television is mounted upon the wall however; was not turned on ( great because once I had my lunch companion put the cell phone down we were able to have a great conversation.) This is the perfect place with a moderate crowd to grab an upscale burger without an upscale price.  Food: The burger was very tasty and reminded me of the perfect cheese burger that I ate while I was in Japan. The \"best of both\" was tasty however the onion rings were cut so thin that they reminded me of string fries in a bad way (-). The smallest burger that I would suggest is the semi-serious (highlighted on the menu) as the $1 difference is a noticeable upgrade. I had a hard time finding my classic burger underneath the bun. The picture displayed is the semi-serious burger. The hamburger buns are toasted with butter and made me smile while I jumped up and down. Fountain soda had a good mix and I guess that the price is okay since you get a free re-fill. Other items on the menu wings, shakes, malts, and salads were not sampled. Good nitch as they stayed true to the product \"cheese burgers\". Fair warning $$ and the burger free toppings have a great selection from lettuce to tomatoes however; the premium toppings such as bacon (.99) and mushrooms(.99) cost extra. My bill was approximately $24 for 2 burgers (classic w/free toppings and the semi w/bacon and mushrooms), 1 medium onion ring and french fry combo (able to split between us), 1 fountain drink with free refill, and one glass of water with refill, ouch.  Customer Service was great with frequent inquiries from all of the floor servers \"great concept and job\" (+). Bill was not presented until requested (+) gave me  time to think about other menu items and enjoy the personal service (the reason that you go to have a sit down meal).  This is the first 30-60 days that this place has been opened and I am curious if they can hold the line when they really get busy in the next few months and the summer crowd."}
{"text":"WOW, Service was top notch! Our server even took the time to play a game of tic tac toe with one of my daughters. I ate a 20 ounce (precooked weight) hamburger a few years ago and had my picture placed on the wall. Today I returned and became a \"repeat offender \". My only complaint is that the half of the bun that my hamburger sat upon was a bit on the thin size, so thin my burger wanted to slide off the bun like a fast food burger. Other than that everything, service, taste of food, the music and even the decor, all added up to a very nice dining experience."}
{"text":"Dried out burgers, grainy milkshakes and a greasiest of fries. Our burgers were both ordered medium and they were extra medium well and tasteless. The shakes weren't blended well so were lumpy. $40 on two burgers, two orders of fries and two small shakes, and we threw half of it out. Massively overpriced.  Don't come here if you're in a hurry. We waited about 20 minutes for takeout.   The only decent thing about this visit was the staff, which seemed understaffed but hard working."}
{"text":"I was thinking 4 stars, but the milkshake put it over the top, so it's probably really a 4.5, but dang they have great milkshakes!  I did the giant famous 20 ounce burger challenge and got my picture on the wall of fame.  The cheeseburger was juicy, well cooked, and delicious.  25 different toppings to choose from...all FREE!  Most burger places would charge for extra toppings such as guacamole, but toppings are free here, which is great.  The atmosphere was fun, old diner style, and the staff was outstanding.  Most burger places these days are going towards the thin burger patty with very little meat, such as In N Out, Steak N Shake, Freddies, etc., and that's fine if you're in the mood to enjoy the cheese and/or toppings more than the meat.  But sometimes you're just in the mood for beef, and the burger at Cheeburger Cheeburger will satisfy those beef cravings while still letting you enjoy the cheese and toppings.  Give this place a try, and don't forget the milkshake!"}
{"text":"Was a bit of a drive for me to get here so I was hoping for a decent experience...and it was worth the drive. Good burger with plenty of toppings and make your own options. A la carte ordering, fries and sauces are not included. Excellent shakes! The fries were a little on the skinny side, not my personal fave but they were good."}
{"text":"I was able to make the UYE burger challenge after all, but didn't participate in the 1 lb competition.  I was at a BBQ earlier in the day and since I completed the challenge last month, I didn't feel compelled to do it again.  So, I decided I would give the Milkshake & Onion Rings a try.  I ordered an Oreo Cheesecake & Peanut Butter Milkshake and a Small order of Onion Rings.  The Milkshake was good, but it was too runny.  I like thick Shakes.  The Onion Rings were very thin and very, very greasy....didn't have much flavor either.....very bland.  Despite ordering the Creamy Jalapeno Sauce to go along with the Onion Rings, it didn't help it much.  Overall, I had a good time with fellow Yelpers at the UYE, but the food was eh.  Will I return?  Probably not....there are too many burger joints in town and this one is kind of far from my house."}
{"text":"We had a friend's birthday party here, and we were a large group of over 20.  The restaurant was packed not to mention really pink inside.   I was the only one of over 20 people to order the veggie burger, and it was tasty! You get to pick a selection of ingredients to add to your burger and I chose fried onion ring, black olives, guacamole and roasted red peppers and you also get to choose the type of cheese you wanted (Pepper Jack was my choice). Around the table people chose from the classic burger all the way up to the 3/4 pound burger. (There is the 1 pound burger as well) Considering the size of the group, our serve did their best to accommodate us, and our food came out quicker than we though.  According to the birthday kid Milkshakes were amazing there, but due to the volume of clients, it seems that they ran out of milkshakes, for a few at our table. I think I would like to go back to see what regular service would be like if we were say a table of 4-6 instead."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed it. Desiree took great care of us. The burger was awesome. The mocha shake is to go! I like."}
{"text":"Before a dreadful connection to ATL on Delta I stopped here in my hometown airport.  I always heard how good this place was (as a chain) and finally I got to stop in.  Once again, another fast food stop, but its pretty tasty for being just fast food.  Their specialty is making burgers cooked to order, and I think that in and of itself is pretty awesome  Yes...a far way from Sanibel :("}
{"text":"Very retro dinner with good burgers! Shakes are good too! Not sure how I feel about the sauces, none were amazing, but  a ranch kinda girl. For sure   Not sure I would go back, but glad I made it there once."}
{"text":"Shakes were solid, but apparently their cooks don't know meat temperatures. I didn't know medium meant well done. Very disappointed in the food, but the service was good."}
{"text":"What a fantastic Cheeseburger Joint!!  You'd never expect to walk into a pink neon-lit 50's diner from the outside.  This restaurant is part of a new little center wtih a \"lodge\" theme - river rocks, the whole deal.  But once inside the door, you're back at the malt shop of your parent's teens.  The hostess sat us quickly on a Saturday afternoon and briefly explained the menu to us.  Burgers, fries, rings, salads and shakes - the menu isn't complex, but it's loaded with choices.  40-something flavors to mix and create your favorite combination of shake.  (I can't recommend the Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana highly enough!)  The burgers are straightforward, just choose the size (quarter through full pound!) and choose your cheese and toppings.  The french fries and onion rings are absolutley amazing.  Fresh made right there, never frozen.  We ordered a full size \"half and half\" (fries and rings) and it was too much for the three of us.  The optional dipping suaces were really tasty too - we got cheese, habenaro jelly and creamy jalepeno.  (The spicy sounding ones were not as hot as you'd expect - just super yummy.)  They do to-go orders, and you can place your order over the internet.  Personally, I think this place is best suited for pulling up a chair and enjoying a fresh-made, juicy burger and a tall, creamy malt.  (I do mean juicy on the burgers - the rolls of paper towels on the table got used a lot by my brother and husband.)  Cheeburger Cheeburger will be our new favorite burger joint - a wonderful (and much cheaper) replacement for Burger Bar.  No, it's not as FAB-U-LOUS as Burger Bar (at Mandalay Place) but at half the cost, I'll happliy lose the opportunity for foie gras on my burger.  One note on the wait for your meal: the menu asks for patience as they make everything to order - so expect to wait about 15 minutes.  Honestly, between our milkshakes and the trivia cards on the table, the time went quickly.  And don't be afriad to be adventurous with your milkshake.  My brother's Reese's Pieces shake was a bit bland, so they happily added peanut butter and re-blended it when he asked.  Great service!!  We're looking forward to going back and trying new burger and shake combos!  (and OMG, more of those onion rings!)"}
{"text":"I come here about once a month or so.  Burgers are always cooked to perfection and taste great.  Fries need a little work, but they are overall a good restaurant.  The shakes are always so good and taste frothy with each bite.  Will be back again!"}
{"text":"I can see the other reviewers frustration with this restaurant, but you really can't beat how great the food is.  Our order took literally 25 minutes to get (worse than the rainbow location), but it was cooked to perfection and a really good hamburger.  I always order a shake while I visit them and it's nice bs frothy as I remembered.  Blueberry shakes are so freaking good!  If you manage to come to this side of town, it's a must place to visit.  Only thing that needs work is the wait times."}
{"text":"A lil pricey but great burgers that you customize and awsome milkshakes.  Peanut butter and jelly milkshake.. yummy!"}
{"text":"Great food and great customer service!  AJ was awesome, was totally patient as we worked through our burger creation. :)   The food is made to order so always tastes fresh and their shakes have amazing flavor.  And the large fries truly are enough for 2, as advertised.  Cheeburger Cheeburger is our go to burger joint that's close to home and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed Cheeburger!   Their burgers are big and stuffed with all the goodness you can choose.  You could come here everyday and literally have a different burger for a year if not more.  Their choices are diverse and if you like shakes, you'll love it here.   Creamy, rich and and just all over goodness makes this one of my favorite experiences of my last visit to Vegas.  Chocolate and peanut butter was the bomb!!!   Only thing I would have preferred is that they wrapped up the bill quicker and got our to go items faster to us.   The wait was a bit long.     Great place to try...have a feeling I'll make the trek on my next visit to Vegas..."}
{"text":"They have a lot to learn.  We opted to try this new burger place but will never know how the food is. Talk about slow that is an understatement.  It was so slow we never did receive our food.  After waiting an hour after our order was taken we walked out.  Now I heard excuses before but to say your food takes longer because it is so fresh holy cow!  Because you must have been slaughtering the cow onsite and grinding the meat.  Next time check on your customers more often, then offer the truth when you realize you screwed up.  Don't send a manager after the customer asked about their food 20 minutes ago and tables around them that received their orders before yours when yours was placed a good 15 minutes before.  Amazing Smashburger down the street had our fresh cooked burgers to us in 8 minutes.  A lot to learn."}
{"text":"Update, the  location is closed and the doors are boarded shut."}
{"text":"I actually can't give a thorough review of this place since all I had were French fries and a milkshake which were both good. All 3 of my friends who ordered burgers were violently ill the next day. Not me though. Needless to say, we haven't been back since."}
{"text":"I actually love everything about this place except one critical problem. The buns are probably the worst buns I know of anywhere. They are horrible, and they fall apart. I took the time to write the company, no response. I can walk there, love everything else, but cant go for a burger. sad"}
{"text":"Love it, especially LOVE the orange pineapple shake. They go above & beyond, whenever they have fresh pineapple they ask if i'd like that in the shake also. The onion rings & that dipping sauce are dreamy!"}
{"text":"1 star for food , 2nd star for our waitress . This place is ok . Came here for a dinner with the family we are from L.A and I have always heared this place is awesome well no its not . Our order was all wrong and our burgers were undercooked. Took over an hour for our food and the fries and onion rings were discusting with grease dripping off .   Loud and noisy  Crammed seating  Freezing inside  The hostess was pulling up her pants the whole time when she was walking around seating people her pants were falling and she was pulling them up by the belt buckle holes and her pants were ripping on the thigh from pulling so hard !"}
{"text":"Very friendly service. Pumpkin shake is incredible! Greasy but fun and definitely something to try at least once....maybe more for the yummy shakes. :)"}
{"text":"It's hard to review this place.  I come here often and love to order their veggie burger platter, wraps or veggie burger salad.  The portions are huge, I love their onion rings, sauces, and endless (FREE) burger toppings.   I've had a few shakes from here every once in a while, however I can't jusify the price (almost $6+) to get another one anytime soon.  I'm excited to try their new fried mushrooms in the future and it makes me feel better that all of their items are cooked in peanut oil. I mostly get take out from here, and sometimes sit down to eat.  The decor of this place is just awful but I like the food when I'm looking for a splurge.  I love the menu, the customization options and the veggie friendly choices. The fries here are not very good in my opion, and cannot be kept for leftovers, that is a drawback. The other thing is it seems to take a while for them to make my food, regardless of if I'm dinning in or call ahead for take out. As much as I come here, I am regrettful almost everytime afterwards because of the expensive prices once I get my bill. It comes to around $14 to get the platter for lunch (without a drink), while it is a lot of food, it's a bit too expensive for the quality of food.  If they would lower the prices even by a dollar or two, I'd come back much more and have a better experience."}
{"text":"Came here for the UYE.  I almost drove by it since their is not a large sign or anything out front.  The restaurant is designed to be like a 50's burger joint, I think.    The menu is impressive, with milkshakes and burgers dominating most of it.  They only use angus beef for their burgers, so for some culinary reason, they only come cooked medium or higher.  I got mine medium well, and it was a little dry.  The burger was nothing special.  The unique thing about this restaurant is all the choices you have with the menu items.  There are muliltple, multiple milkshake flavors that you can combine to create something unique.  As for the burgers, there are different cheeses and toppings such as feta, cheddar, american, banana peppers, avocado, honey mustard, A1, etc.  I also ordered an onion ring and french fry appetizer.  The fries were made from whole potatoes, skin left on.  They were a little mushy on the outside as well as the inside.  The onion rings however were superb I thought.  The coating was very light and crispy, almost like tempura, it was not heavy and breaded.  The service was a little lacking for our group's visit.  Granted, it was a very large group, but you figure they would have some system for the waitresses to handle it.  Drink refills were inconsistent and took forever to get our bills.  I think if you were a smaller party, then the service wouldn't be a problem."}
{"text":"Delicious diner food. Great service. Fries are delicious. Milkshakes are yummy! Cooked to order."}
{"text":"// The Bad // - Hostess invaded my personal space by grabbing a very personal pendant I wear without asking permission and was way too close in general. - The food took a long time to reach us. 15 minutes for two burgers and fries. - When the food arrived, half of my friend's 1 lb. burger was completely raw, mine 1/3 lb. burger was only slightly undercooked. - The waitstaff was inefficient. During the first five or so minutes of our meal, we had three servers visit us a total of six times. During the last five minutes of our meal, no one came by.  // The Good // + My shake was delicious. Great consistency and flavor for something super customizable (you can choose from like 30 different flavors). + My burger was tasty. + The pricing is reasonable.  Summary: Go to pickup a shake, but stay away from the hostess and keep a good grip on your valuables and things you don't want."}
{"text":"I can't believe I live near this place and just barely tried it last weekend after having lived in Vegas for a year!  1 star = for the retro atmosphere inside; kind of like dining in the 70's.  2 stars = for getting to make your burger any way you want.  They offer a wide range of toppings from mushrooms, to A1 steak sauce, and even garlic.  Making it your way is definitely a great idea to ensure you like your burger.  If it doesn't taste good, it is your fault!  3 stars = for the different sizes of burgers you can choose from.  You can choose from a beginner's size burger, to a whole 1 pounder.  if you can finish a 1 pounder you get your picture taken and go into their albums of people who were able to complete the challenge.  4 stars = for the option to get a basket of both onion rings AND french fries. Both are yummy and beware, the baskets are huge and the half basket is good enough for 2 to share!  I'll be back for sure!  Especially if I want to make my own burger the way I want it!"}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars.  Vaguely remember trying this place years and years ago. Popped in again for a burger fix and it delivered.   You can certainly taste the quality beefiness of the burger. Very good. The big list of included toppings is fun. I chose chipotle mayo, guacamole, bacon, cheddar and lettuce. Mine was tasty!  You also get to choose from 3 buns. Hubby and I shared a small order of fries (for 1) which was plenty for 2.   Note: if it isn't your thing....they do cover the fries in lots of pepper. I do enjoy the build it yourself concept so you don't end up asking for eliminations and substitutions. You get just what you want.   My little guy got his meal and it came with a cute cardboard fold up car. He was stoked about it.   Obviously, the decor if funky and fun. Perfect for families and kids.   Our server was very nice and friendly and even offered to go cups for our drinks.    I wouldn't hesitate to return if I had a burger craving again soon!"}
{"text":"Didn't get a chance to eat, we waited 10 minutes before anyone even talked to us! And that's only because I flagged a waitress down. She rudley said well we're busy its a 15 minute wait! Couldn't you have told us that earlier? Or acknowledged us? The place was half empty to start with AND this was after a customer walked out telling us the service sucked. We left."}
{"text":"With all the burger places in town we sure Don't need this joint. Meat pure salt and well done fries were just mush! Don't waste your money"}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty good but as others have said for the price there are better options. Burger was overcooked and the fries were pretty limp. If I spend 5 bucks for a basket of frys/onion rings give me a dipping sauce free with it. I am fine with paying a buck if I want more but really?? The staff was really nice and the sodas come in a mason jar with free refills. All in all I wouldn't go back, they had better step it up as by my count there are 5 new burger joints opening around the same area in the next few months."}
{"text":"I decided to go to Cheeburger Cheeburger today because I wanted to try someplace I had never been that had fairly good reviews on Yelp. I was also in the mood for something a little less healthy then what I normally try to eat.   Cheeburger Cheeburger was a little difficult for me to spot, but perhaps  the construction on Rainbow played a factor?  Hopefully that is finished soon.   A friendly employee greeted me when I entered, asked if I was placing an order to go (I was) and then proceeded to answer the questions I had about the menu. This place is a control freaks dream come true. You get to decide almost everything that goes into your burger... The type of meat (they serve turkey burgers), the size, how well cooked it is, the toppings (most of which were free of charge, which was nice). The only thing I didn't see an option for was the type of bun. They also have salads and wraps that you order in a similar fashion, picking out all the toppings you want.  I ended up with the smallest burger, the Classic, and added cheddar cheese plus all the standard toppings I like: Lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup and mustard. That seemed a little boring to me, so I had them throw on some sauteed mushrooms (which was an additional charge).  The food took about 15 minutes to prepare. Nothing unreasonable, but next time I will either call my order in or place it online so I can avoid the wait. Once I got back to work and ate it, I was happy but not blown away. Not by the burger at least...   My birthday cake flavored milkshake was SO yummy! Like heaven in a cup yummy. A little on the runnier side, but I didn't mind, it was so good that I was eating it quickly and a thicker shake would have just impeded my progress!   I am not sure how soon I will head back to Cheeburger Cheeburger. Next time I go, I will probably get a salad. And of course, another milkshake. Actually, I may go back just for a shake sometime."}
{"text":"Visited this place last night. The hostess was really nice, as were the servers (they both came by and made sure we were taken care of during the meal.) The restaurant is really cute, it's SUPER bright pink tacky '50s diner (I mean tacky in the most lovable way). There was a balloon girl going from table to table since it was Saturday night, but there were not really many other tables in the restaurant.  I meant to order the smallest burger they had but I think I accidentally ordered the next size up, 'cause my burger was pretty darn big. Shared the onion rings and fries combo order, the largest size, with my guy. The fries and rings were not really my favorite simply because I like more crispiness, which I didn't get. But I can see how other people might like them.  I'm gonna be honest in that I have the flu and couldn't taste anything. Like... nothing. So this is more of a review of service and price.  My guy commented that they nickel and dime you for everything, which is true. The menu looks really cheap when you glance over it, but the burgers do not come with fries. It was 6.99 for the large onion ring/fries basket, and .99 for a 1oz ramekin of horseradish sauce (at least give a large ramekin for that price.) It was 1.59 extra for him to get onions and mushrooms on his burger. Drinks were almost 3.00 for small mason jars, and it was 3.99 for a small milkshake (that I hear was stellar, he got pumpkin pie and raved about it nonstop. Unfortunately, like I said, everything tasted like nothing to me.) It was 42.00 for 2 of us. After the tip, my guy said \"I really feel pretty gypped that I just spent 50.00 on burgers. We could have had a really nice dinner for that elsewhere.\"  I'll be back to bring my mom to see the decor and actually taste the burgers and shakes, but will be skipping the fries and onion rings! 'til I can taste the food, I'll leave this at 3 stars :)"}
{"text":"We've eaten at Cheeburger Cheeburger several times over the years and our experienced is mixed--good sometimes, less satisfactory others.  I stopped by for lunch the other day, mostly because the Mexican place in the same shopping center was closed.  The cheeseburger was pretty good this time.  Their method is that you choose the cheese and then as many toppings as you want.  It's a nice system.  They also have good fries and onion rings, although I didn't get any this time since I was alone and not all that hungry.  I did splurge on a milkshake (frappes from my Boston days).  They make them in lot of flavors and feature different kinds of mix-ins.  I got a yummy Butterfinger one!  Here was the problem: they will only cook the burgers medium or more.  This really infuriates me because I like my burgers medium rare.  And excuse me, but I think that I should be able to get them the way I want them, even if I have to sign some kind of waiver that I won't sue them.  Here's the pisser: when it came, their version of medium was a perfectly cooked medium rare.    The server I had was TERRIBLE.  Really, one of the worst service experiences I've ever had.  She was very officious about the medium rare/medium thing and from then on practically dropped everything on my table.  I usually don't tell servers how I feel if they do not do a good job--conflict avoidance at all costs--but this one was so awful that I actually told her what I felt.  I informed her that since she's working for tips that being unpleasant to her customers is not really a winning strategy for making money.  I will not likely go back and recommend that everyone avoid it as well, at least the Fraser store."}
{"text":"Love the burgers, milkshakes and the fries oh my! Thanks Alex and Jaslin for the fabulous service, you ladies are absolute gems! Jaslin, my favorite primo espanol I look forward to the Christmas holidays with you"}
{"text":"Very disappointing after waiting this long to try it out.   Other than the shakes, it was a bust. Will return for shakes to go,  but no more over cooked burgers or undercooked onion rings for us."}
{"text":"This is an absolutely fabulous burger place! It is a chain, although most of them are located down south. From the looks of it from the outside it looks like a crappy burger place people that work in the shopping mall go to eat, but oh boy will you be wrong thinking that!   I don't know whether to tell you that the curly fries, the pounder, or the milkshakes are the best part....so I suggest trying all three! This is truly an old-fashioned burger joint where the burgers are huge (and hugely delicious), the milkshakes are thick and creamy, and the decor is from the 60s and 70s.   If you're hungry give the Pounder a shot. It is not very difficult to finish, although they do make a big deal, and take your picture, if you finish it.   If you work in the area, it's a great place to grab a lunch during the week as a break from whatever you normally eat!"}
{"text":"I and my family really wanted this place to be awesome but sadly it wasn't.  Burger came out looking more like a meatball then a burger. The taste of the burger was mediocre. It could use some salt and pepper, trusts me a good seasoned burger goes a long way. The staff was nice.   However we order some of their dipping sauce the (Cheese and creamy jalapeno) and our server forgot to bring them out to us with our food and I had to hunt him down to get them. The cheese sauce was cold and had little to no flavor as for the creamy jalapeno one it was just ok.  The only two things that night was the cardboard car that comes with the kid's meal and the fries and onion rings were pretty. I really hope this place gets better."}
{"text":"The burgers are good but not amazing, the chili dogs aren't bad either but for me the only reason I keep coming back to this place is to keep trying more of the milk shake flavors that they have.  So far blueberry is my favorite, but I've only tried about six so far."}
{"text":"its great because you can build your burger and your shake the way you want it. be cautious with the shakes because not all the flavors are natural. go ahead and get the pounder so you can have your picture on the wall but that thing is the cause of 27% of all cardiac disease deaths in this country."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Its fun and the decor sends an nostalgic images of a great place to eat a burger. It was ok. Staff was great, just kinda wish they had more spirit because it it after all a burger joint. 5 Stars for service. -2 for the place and burger."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, 50s style burger joint. Food was great, lots of vegetarian choices, fries and onion rings were delicious!   Note: we were charged for the sauces we got with the onion rings and fries, our fault for not checking, but they werent the best sauces we ended up using ketchup."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for burgers and shakes! The staff are very friendly and kind! Everything is made to order and is fresh not frozen. Their menu has so many toppings to add to burgers, salads and sandwiches! They also have a ton of shake flavors too! I had the hazel nut shake which was so good! Love their onion rings and fries made fresh to order! So delicious!"}
{"text":"Just had probably the most tasteless burger ever while waiting for my connecting flight. Could have been 'pink slime',  might have been cardboard or maybe hydrogenated fish tails. Fries tasted ok, but limp and greasy - its definitely no Five Guys.  There was a burrito joint on the left and pizza to the right, you may want to try them out instead."}
{"text":"I was shocked when I walked in to Cheeburger Cheeburger last night. The building it is in is so fancy looking with the stone. I felt like I was under dressed just pulling in to the parking lot. But inside tells another story. Bright pink neon lighting. Tourquoise blue and chrome seats. Glass block walls. It is a total 50s throwback complete with the music of the era. I admit, I'm a sucker for oldies music. If I hear it in a place, I'm going to like it more often than not. The food is a big part too and there is no shortage of food here. I tend to be a big eater so when I tell you that you wont leave hungry, believe me. I ordered an angus platter after several minutes of deliberation and deep thought. I was a bit overwheled at all the possible options. Fortunately the staff was there to help and walked me through the process. I settled on the platter, as I said. I ordered my burger with lettuce, tomato, pine apple, swiss cheese and teriyaki sauce. It came with grilled onion already which is fine by me. I chose fries though \" The Best of Both Worlds\" (onion rings and fries) was recommended. I didn't feel I needed both. I got the horseradish sauce for dipping. I also ordered a salad. It was big with wild greens, cheese, olives and croutons. There was just barely enough dressing to satisfy. I could have asked for more but that would have been too much for my liking. My burger came out as 10 oz of delicious angus cooked a perfect medium and topped with my requested toppings. I am not going to say it was the best burger I've had but it was pretty darned good. My main complaint is that the bun was very bready and a tad on the dry side. Still, a good burger that was quite filling. The fries were good as well. Crispy and salty the way good fresh fries should be. I stopped there and passed on dessert last night. I'm regretting that today. To complete the experience I should have ordered a cherry cola and a chocolate malt. That would have been the perfect 50s diner experience. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"My parents, husband and I went to Cheeburger Cheeburger last week.  We've been there before so we knew what to expect this time.  The first time we went was information overload and we all ordered too many toppings.  There is every topping imaginable on the menu!  With too many toppings, our burgers all fell apart and we ended up eating them with our forks.  This time we focused on the good stuff!  I think we finished 2 medium orders of onion rings in world record time!  We were SO hungry and they tasted so wonderful!  Not too much breading and not too much grease...just the right amount!  The onion rings are definitely better than the fries.  We all agreed the burgers were better this time around.  There wasn't a morsel left on the table!  Their shakes are great and service is always friendly.  Only complaint...kind of random location. Otherwise, it's a fun place to try, especially if you like the 50's diner style music and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I totally prefer Cheeburger Cheeburger over the incredibly OVERRATED Five Guys.  Had the Semi-Serious burger cooked medium (I like the fact they actually cook them the way you want them unlike 5 Blokes) with an order of small Onion Rings. Sorry, I don't like their fries or Five Lardbutts fries either ( I despise natural cut fries, limp, greasy and gritty is not my idea of delicious). Burger was perfect, nice and thick, cooked medium just how I asked and it was juicy, and I really liked the onion rings (and a small order was HUGE).  I think back to the dry tiny burger I got from 5 Blokes and scratch my head, wow they are overrated. I'll take Cheeburger Cheeburger everytime over them."}
{"text":"I've been here about 5 times in the last 3 years and this was by far the worst experience concerning the food.  I ordered a well done burger and side salad and was met with a disastrous meal.  My burger was really burnt and hard on the outside, which means they don't know how to do a well cooked burger and the salad was old and welted.  I tried to eat as much of the salad as I could but I was picking through it for most of the meal, so I asked what could be done and the server took it off the bill.  The service is always great here but the food really needs some improvement. Not sure if I'd give CC another chance but sure do hope they get things squared away soon."}
{"text":"Personally MY favorite place! I'm into those 1980s typa restaurants, and this is definitely the place to be. Although, I haven't tried their burgers, but wow they have the best and cutest desserts! Everytime I come in here I would always order my own customized banana split. Their servers are also nice and welcoming! It's such a cute place, it's like a flashback in the 20th century. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Twice in one week, love it here, love it that it's far away from the huslten and bustle from town and the staff is super friendly and the food is SUPERB."}
{"text":"Well there was so much hype for this place and I have to admit I wasnt impressed. Service wasnt great, wasnt very clean, and the burgers from what I heard were suppose to be amazing but I say In and out burgers or Mcdonalds are better if not close to their quality of burger. It reminded me of a place trying to be a higher class fast food restaurant. I am however very picky so maybe I'm not one to ask how good it was but I say it wasnt anything to brag about. Plus mcdonalds fries are waaaaay better. No joke! Wont be going back to this place unless I am on the verge of starvation."}
{"text":"I went to this location with my family went to this location hoping that it would be a great third time, man was I wrong.  The staff they had on hand during the time was extremely slow, not to mention that they messed up mine and my sister's order, three times! I wanted to let the situation go but then the waitress said she'd take care of my order and she ended up STILL charging us for the orders they messed up on despite her saying, \"she'd take care of it\". The rest of the staff laughed at my family as they were disappointed with their meal and the waitress named Alexa was nice and replaced her fries that she was unsatisfied with but still making us pay for the whole meal?! The total even came out to $3 more than the original bill was. I'm highly disappointed with this location and will NEVER come back!"}
{"text":"Food was so bland that it made me want to slap somebody lol. No seriously I had a cheese burger with bacon and cheddar cheese and it had nooo flavor. It was pretty gross, and my fries weren't even done. Smh."}
{"text":"Yum!  If you are in the mood for a good, juicy burger exactly the way you like it- Cheeburger Cheeburger is the place for you. Everything is build your own- burgers, shakes, and chicken sandwiches. My husband was a bit more adventurous than me. He had a 1/2 lb burger with pepper jack, sauted mushrooms, black olives, and honey mustard ( I know he is a weirdo) he was in heaven. I played on the safe side with a 1/3lb burger with jack/cheddar cheese, thousand island, and bacon. The burgers were actually cooked to medium, the buns were good, they are just god burgers. It is an al a carte setting so you order the fries separately. Those are also delicious. We spent about $20 for the both of us to have a burger and split an order of fries- not too shabby considering how tasty it was."}
{"text":"I only gave it 2 stars because the server was friendly although not good at returning to refill my soda.  She was behind counter chatting with other server so I had to call out for her to bring me a refill although I was the only customer in the place.  I returned the french fries because they were oily and overcooked.  The bun had been toasted at one time but it was cold and did not compliment the cheeseburger.  Although it was Wednesday and I got a senior discount, it was too expensive for the quality of the food.  I got onion rings to replace french fries and the breading was scarce and not tasty.  Best onion rings are at Farmer Boys. I will not return to this place nor recommend it."}
{"text":"These guys can't even spell cheeseburger let alone make a decent one (see what I did there)...You really have to work hard to make burgers and fries unappetizing but this place manages to pull it off. Buns on are cold and dry, and meat is usually cooked until it becomes vulcanized.  Onion rings are oil sponges and they use flavored syrups in the shakes (even Elvis wouldn't approve)... I like the idea of place that does basic diner food, but this place isn't it... Lots of people seem to like this place but I'm pretty sure it's because the portions are large, the prices are cheap, and the food is fried; that is the holy trifecta for American opinion. If you are just looking to fill your stomach with lots of calories this place will do, but if you actually want good food, move along."}
{"text":"Best Burger place on Eastern Ave. Great beef and amazing shakes and Sasha was very nice."}
{"text":"JE SUIS TELLEMENT DÉCUE QUE CE SOIT FERMÉ!!! :(  C'était mon restaurant préféré a montreal. Meilleurs burgers, toujours a mon gout, meilleurs milkshakes, excellent service, super ambiance (retro), j'ai adoré mon expérience. c'était le seul détour que je faisais pour un bon restaurant a montreal avant le cinema ou tout autre sorties. Très décue de voir que c'est fermé."}
{"text":"Ok so we decided to try out Cheeburger Cheeburger, and if you love kids then this place is for you.  Not only is the service slow they also messed up our order. The manager of the place is timid and does not approach problem tables and only go to ones with no problems. Just sitting here and watching numerous issues among other tables and how long food took to get served. Not sure we will be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant already had mediocre reviews but I wanted to see for myself.... shouldn't just relied on the reviews.  Interior: 50s diner decor but this is more restaurant than fast food. The layout is set up to make you sit down and eat rather than to just get your food to go. Hostess in the front to greet and seat you.   Service: For the most part was pretty cordial.  I had ordered their chocolate, banana and peanut butter shake which was too thick but the server was more than willing to blend it longer.   Food: The lay out of the menu is extremely confusing.  For a cheeseburger place, you wouldn't think that the menu could be that extensive and difficult to comprehend. 25 toppings but when i received my burger didn't seem like much of the toppings were there.  The burger patty only comes as medium and higher (NO MEDIUM RARE). This was really disappointing since i love pink in my beef but whatever. Their cole slaw is actually really good probably better than KFCs.   Shake: Got the chocolate, banana and peanut butter shake but there was so much peanut butter in it that it felt warm. The server blended it a bit longer and added chocolate but it still too peanut buttery.   Overall: I wouldn't come back here.  The burger was dry since there is no medium rare option and the toppings were hardly there. Go to in n out down the street or even freddys."}
{"text":"I just had one of the most disgusting meals I've ever had in the past 35 years.  I had them deliver a burger and fries and the fries looked like they had been cooked in grease a month old....and tasted like it too.  The hamburger was so pink, it looked like someone had taken it out of the fridge, slapped it on the grill for a minute, and put it on a bun.  It was even \"rare\", it was just pink......like it was still raw.  It was all nasty and I threw it all away.  You're better off going to a dumpster than eating this garbage."}
{"text":"I'm marking this off my list of options for burger joints. Yes it's close to home and it's pretty affordable but the taste...eh and the service, meh. That's how I feel, no words. Got the burger deal for the semi serious, I think and it came with fries and a drink for $10, not bad. The decor is fun 50's diner-ish and they have a burger club for those brave enough to eat their ridiculously sized burgers. The night I went was very slow, maybe 3 tables including mine. I asked for egg on my burger. I just want to note the EGG is FAKE. I expected runny yoke in a fried egg. Check out my pic. I should have been warned but thankfully they took it off seeing as I didn't touch it. It's an ok place that might be fun for kids but for us true foodies, no thanks."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a new place to have lunch on weekends. Yesterday we set out to drive down Eastern until we found something that interested us. We didn't get far before my husband saw the Cheeburger Cheeburger sign and wanted to stop in. I don't get as excited about burger places, but I was pleasantly surprised.   First, everyone working there was very friendly. Some of the friendliest service I've had in a long time. They greeted us as soon as we walked in which made us feel very welcome. They also  explained the menu when we said we were first timers. We were checked in on several times while we dined. It just seemed like the employees took genuine pride in the service they were providing which was refreshing.  The menu offers a great selection. For the burger you choose the size, cheese, add-ons like bacon or egg, and then choose from a huge list of toppings that are included in the cost. I love that there are plenty of toppings included unlike many of the gourmet burger places that charge for every last item.   I started with a half order of a raspberry malt and my husband ordered the peach shake. Both shakes were very tasty and I liked the option to order a half size (still plenty of shake). I ordered the 1/4 pound burger with bacon, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayo, and lettuce. It was really good and plenty of burger for me. My husband ordered similar toppings, but on a 1/2 pound burger. That size was good for him, but would have been too much for me. We shared an order of the onion rings and french fries. Both tasted like they were made in house and were lighter than the usual fried foods. I really enjoyed those. I ordered jalapeno sauce to dip with them, but enjoyed the onion rings and fries too much to ruin them with dip."}
{"text":"This place has a oldies diner look. I like the style of the restaurant. However, the food  that I ordered was mediocre. I ordered a hot dog as the one shown in the menu. It didn't taste that good. The hot dog wasn't cooked correctly. I should of played it safe and ordered a burger since it is a burger place. I had a stomach ache after leaving. I tried their coffee shake. It was good. I would go back just for the shakes only."}
{"text":"Wow, nothing bad to say about this place. After my first visit, it has become a weekly staple.  The fries are good (one order will definitely feed two), but this place isn't about the fries. It's burgers. Love the menu. You pick the toppings, all of them. Have been trying different combinations, and they've all been good. So far my favorite is my teriyaki combination with swiss cheese, pineapple, bacon, and teriyaki sauce. The burgers are definitely hand-patted, and if you get the half-pounder, it more than covers the bun. Service has always been good, and the place is clean. I'll take this place over the burger bar at Mandalay anyday."}
{"text":"What a great family place to eat!  You get so many options on your burger that it's always a new experience when eating there. The shakes are my kids favorite too. My favorite is the ONION RINGS! Yum!   It's a 50s style restaurant and the interior is full of neon and era worthy furniture. I could not give 5 stars because of two issues. Inconsistent service usually good but sometimes awful. There have been a few times that there's a sewage type odor.  Worth the check out though!"}
{"text":"very good burgers and fries i have lots more to try here. And very friendly"}
{"text":"No Bacon? Really? You serve breakfast sandwiches and you don't have bacon? That wouldn't be a big deal if the cashier hadn't waited to tell me this until after ringing up my bacon, egg and cheese sandwich. The two employees definitely seemed annoyed I walked up and placed an order while they were prepping for the AM rush, which caused me to wonder if they were really out of bacon or just shoeing me away while they finished their prep. Either way, not good."}
{"text":"Fun place to eat out at. Burgers as promised are yum and big! I am yet to try the shakes.  Old American diner look and feel with great burgers! Like the place."}
{"text":"While this place offers good service their burgers leave much to be desired. Even after ordering seasonings for my burger it still tasted bland. The onion rings are soggy and you can do without them. The fries however are amazing!"}
{"text":"Drove past as many people do. Menu was fair sized and the host spent about 5 minutes going over all the items being our ' first time' , I would suggest skipping the run down had a bit of a headache with all the choices and combos. The burgers may be healthy a better beef but once cooked it didnt fit the bun maybe from lack of prep making them thin sized? Everything seemed a la carte, and a big bill for something I could have gotten at Carls Jr ($6 burger) for less.  The ambience was nice, lots of neon and 50s decor. Service seemed slow. How long should it take to make a burger, few people when we were there. Ordered 2 burgers, fries & onion rings and cokes added up to a $25 bill plus tip."}
{"text":"I love a good 50's themed restaurant but it isn't quite like the one I grew up with in San Diego. I typically rate restaurants based on the best I've ever experienced so that would be Corvettes for me.  The food  at Cheeburger Cheeburger is still good and it looks like the atmosphere has shaped up a bit from when I was last there a couple of years ago.  I liked the idea that you can choose your own toppings. I'm glad they had some spicy selections like pepper jack cheese, jalapenos and I think they even had chipotle mayo. I loved the different sauces that you can order with the curly fries. I think next time I will not order all of them because I only found myself dipping the fries in Ranch or the melted cheese.   We ended our meal with a huge banana split that can be easily shared by three. I chose some of the topping like chopped M&M's and nuts ..yum!"}
{"text":"Nice burger joint from down south. A tasty burgers made to order with 20+ toppings and 7+ cheeses available. Milkshakes tons of flavors 50+. Everything was juicy and made to order. Gotta come back and try more stuff."}
{"text":"I LOVE being able to pick from dozens of toppings for my burger, and endless variates of milkshakes. The burgers are delicious, beware, anything bigger then the SMALLEST burger is HUMUNGOUS!!! I was disappointed by the fries though, they weren't very tasty and were a little burnt. I'm not sure if I got an old batch that was sitting there for a while, so there's a chance that it was a fluke. Nevertheless, my husband and I play it safe and just get the small burger and a milkshake (one each), and we're always stuffed afterwards! Always great, speedy service."}
{"text":"This play is not ideal. The manager did not put bacon, cheddar cheese and cole slaw on my burger like I requested after I waited for a hour for them to open outside. When I called and told him he said that he seen the chef make my burger and that it had it on it basically calling me a liar! Very poor customer service..It takes them forever to get your order ready and the hot cheese is not good at all! It's over priced and the manager asked me to promote the business like i was a employee or something. I see why they are so SLOW! This place is trying to be the next Fuddruckers but don't even come close. DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Do you like a basic Cheeseburger made fresh with what you want on it?  Have you already tried Fuddruckers, 5 and diner, Hamburger Works, Hamburger Mary's, Lenny's, Ted's, Ruby Tuesday's, TGI Friday's, heck even Outback for a burger that's right?  Do you want thin onion rings that aren't a messy pile of strings?  Is a light tempura coating preferable to a thick greasy breading that falls off? Do you want a choice of over 100 shakes- mix and match flavors or straight up vanilla? Want a place to shake and make your soda flavor custom? Want to pay $30 bucks for a well staffed, courteous, clean establishment and have all of the above? Cheeburger Cheeburger is your place.  Yeah, it's  chain... and it's \"off the chain GOOD.\"   I had a semi-serious size blue cheese and avocado, bacon, Jalepano Jack cheese, sweet onion burger that was gone before I realized it. I had a Cheesecake Snickers shake. I had a waitress named Amy who was totally on the ball. My partner had a buffalo blue cheese chicken sandwich that tasted like hot wings without coating and a Chocolate Peanut Butter shake. Our onion rings were crisp, light and stayed in their tempura coating when we bit them.   The potential health consequences for eating such a carnivore dream is worth every finicky choice you select to get it just right and the waitress has zero problems with your particular perfectionism. Highly recommended for that time when you swore you'd never eat another burger, but there you are ordering one anyway.     Finally...a smile from me and a wave back at the staff when we left. Good job Cheeburger Cheeburger."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  Great staff and milkshakes are always great. Especially the birthday cake one."}
{"text":"So I went back here last night with a group of friends who were in the mood for burgers.   It was literally just the four of us in the place until we were leaving another family came in.  Anyways, we got distracted by the apps, fries and onion rings, and all also wanted to try a shake so we ended up not ordering any burgers! Funny how that worked out.   All of the food came out fast and was super tasty. We all liked our shakes, though mine (PB&J) was everyone's favorite!   So apparently if you're in the mood to wait for an hour to eat, get a burger. Otherwise fill up on apps and what not and you'll be fine (that's why it's still an even 4 stars for me).  Also, all of the waitresses were super friendly and helpful; they definitely  contributed to our positive experience!  But most importantly, do not forget to try the fried pickles!"}
{"text":"I have had CBCB bookmarked forever. My family of 4 and I finally made a stop. Upon entering I could think of one thing. Pink. And lots of it. My daughter loved it! We were seated rather quickly and started looking at the menu. We sat for a little longer than I find acceptable before we were offered beverages. My husband had a bananas foster/swiss chocolate shake that was AMAZING, it had fresh banana and a nice chocolate flavor. My kids each had a flavored lemonade. I ordered a pear/pineapple shake a soda but it didn't arrive with the others drinks. I had to remind our server to get my soda. So far our dinner is off to a bumpy start.   On to the menu. I really wanted the fried artichokes, mushrooms, and mac n cheese from the front cover, BUT,  I came for a burger. I noticed an Angus burger platter that comes with a 10oz burger, fries or onion rings, side salad or cole slaw, and grilled onions. You're able to choose from the free toppings list. I had my asked for my burger to be prepared medium and I chose blue cheese, tomato, cole slaw, pickles, 2 onion rings, mayo, and roasted red peppers as my toppings and onion rings for my side.   Our salads came. Nothing exciting mostly romaine, a little mixed greens, chopped tomato, black olives, and croutons.   One of the other servers? overheard my daughter saying she was hungry and had the kids food brought out right away. I love when people pay attention to the kids because usually servers noses are upturned when kids sit at the table. They had the kids hot dogs and fries. Neither of them are the hot dog but the fries were AWESOME.   Our burgers came and they were huge! I cut mine in half to see ZERO pink. We waited for a while since everything is prepared fresh. My 2 little ones were getting bored and were ready to leave by tike our food had come. There was no chance I was waiting on a re-cook. I took a bite. I was very underwhelmed. The meat patty was thick and flavorless. Dry even. I ate about a quarter of my burger and boxed the rest. The onion rings were okay, nothing to write home about. I wish I had ordered fries. My husband only ate half of his burger. We ordered a bananas foster/swiss chocolate shake to go.   Our server was nice. A little too busy/unfocused, but nice. Our bill was $53 before tip. The food was mediocre. I might order fries and shakes to-go though!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner with the family and it was alright. The burgers weren't anything special taste wise. Also it was a bit pricey. My boyfriend and friend did the one pound burger challenge and both finished and got there pictures on the wall with the big hamburger. I ordered the combo that was a 10oz burger all the toppings I wanted onion rings and a side salad. Side salad was good. Everyone ordered shakes and enjoyed them. Service was also good but the amount of time it takes for them to take an order was ridiculous! Guess that's Cheeburgers fault for having so many options to put on your burger."}
{"text":"Alright, Now this is a place I can really pile the toppings on my burger.  I like how you can pick and choose what you want. Instead of getting your ordinary hamburger with lettuce, tomato, pickles, mustard, etc... Personally, I think the 1/2 lb'er is not enough to satiate the stomach. Next time I will order the next one up. The list of shake combinations are a little overwhelming yet I'm considering ordering a different one every time I visit the place. I had my favorite Oreo Shake which was Yummy!"}
{"text":"This place was okay as far as burgers go. The decor is designed to give you the feeling of being in a 50's burger stand. They make milk shakes in one of those old fashioned blenders too.  They have a book of people who had eaten their giant burger. I don't remember how big it was, but it was more meat than a person should eat."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite burger joint EVER! Food is always fantastic and everyone is super friendly. The shakes are also amazing. I do warn you though. This is NOT fast food everything is cooked to order so you will wait either at your table or to take out. If you're in a rush go to the arches. If you want the best burger you will ever have go here!"}
{"text":"I love that I can order my hamburger and fries with all the toping I want. My husband and I got super full with $25 (tip and tax included)"}
{"text":"This is a bit of a hidden-gem of a diner - tucked away in a little complex, and with the little gimmicks of the oversized food challenge and the jar water bottles, and the spruced-up 50s retro thing going on... Really, really cute. It's laid-back, but preppy with the pink walls, and the servers are adorable. I like the place.  I appreciate the customize-your-burger menu style too, there's lots of options! The food is decent, just a bit above average in taste and quality, with large portions. It's on the expensive side, almost not worth the food order, but good enough.   This review is probably closer to a 3.5 for such a cute establishment, but I have to round down for the fact that too many burger places are overrated, and a burger place has to have some fantastic burgers to stand out to me at all.   This is a place for burger-and-fries aficionados, and for meeting up with friends. I don't think I'd be back for the food myself, but I'll tag along with friends if they wanted to meet up here, and it'll always be fun to watch someone try to down a two pound burger. I'd probably just have a milkshake if I do come back again."}
{"text":"I should start by saying I haven't actually tried their burgers. We went here for my cousin's birthday, but I was still full from lunch. As a result, I only ordered a Black and White Malt. It reminded me of the chocolate malts I used to always get at Sonic. It was delicious. Their fries were also rustic and fried perfectly.  Now for some random thoughts. I must say that their menu isn't very Feng Shui. I'm not sure why I thought about this while I was there. It just seems overwhelming to newbies (we had a few in our group). Of course, in reality, the variety in the menu is a good thing. I mean, the shake/malt selection alone offers 78 different flavors, and you can mix whatever you want.  I will have to return to do the one-pound burger challenge. I don't really see it as a challenge; I've had one-pound burgers before. I also want to try their shake sodas."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my family tonight.  Rave reviews for the hamburger, turkey burger, hot dog (Cheedog), fries, onion rings and shakes!!  Great service!  Pricier than other burger locations nearby, but the quality and burger size is better.  So many menu options -- salads, wraps, platters, ice cream, shakes, etc.  Go check this place out.  You won't regret it!  ;)"}
{"text":"First off, this place could not be more perfect for me!!!! The music, the decor, and staff were very \"50s diner\" and I couldn't love it more! The food was very tasty and filling and their chocolate cola is the best in the West!"}
{"text":"Love the food. THE SERVICE SUCKS! Let me be more specific. Waitress was friendly. The bald guy that showed me to my table was OK. Been to the one on Rainbow a few times so i knew what I wanted. I ordered my burger with my drink and then i waited. And waited. And waited. The place was not full or even have full. And waited. There were only 5 other tables seated. All couples but me and one other. And waited. Thirty minutes and the food still wasn't out. I ordered a burger and small fries. Give me a break. The real insult was when they charged me for the iced tea. Waitress didn't even go to the manager, just rang me up. Never going back. I'll drive to the Rainbow location instead. Or just go to the 5 Guys down the street."}
{"text":"Dining out makes my Saturday night alive. This weekend, Cheeseburger Cheeseburger made my Saturday night live.     As soon as I stepped inside I was in a lively 1950s diner environment that is similar to Johnny Rockets. The friendly hostess greeted me before leading me to a booth to the left of the counter seats.Lindsey. S was my attentive server. She explained the process of inventing your own burger. Step 1 I picked the semi-serious burger which is a 1/3 pound of beef for $6.99. The menu alleges that it is everybody's favorite. Step 2 I chose a medium done burger. When it came to a choice of kaiser roll or wheat bun at step 3, I picked the former. At step 4, I chose pepper jack cheese out of the nine choices. Finally at step 5; out of 29 toppings I added lettuce, tomatoes, onions, 1,000 island, chopped black olives, and jalapeno peppers. I am slightly disappointed that there is an additional 99 cents charge for mushrooms. Oh well! Lindsey admitted that this is confusing. I think what she meant was decisions? decisions? At Cheeseburger, Cheeseburger the fries or onion rings and Pepsi beverages are separate. When the bill arrives, the 1950s environment disappears. I ordered the small best of both basket that is a tasty combination of fries and rings for $2.99. Complimenting the food, I drank a Pepsi (free refills) for $2.69.     The toppings were so abundant that the plate included a fork and knife. After my last bite of the 1/3 pound burger, there were leftover jalapeno peppers and tomatoes with the remaining kaiser roll. On account of the quality ingredients, they tasted good without the burger. The onion rings were not these large showy off things that are nice for pictures yet difficult to eat and enjoy. They were three star good just like the fries.     The 1950s and 1960s soundtrack made the restaurant alive. I prefer the upbeat restaurants that play the feel good oldies of Elvis, the Beach Boys, and Marvin Gaye to some of the upscale restaurants where you can hear nothing but your thoughts. Restaurants such as Cheeseburger Cheeseburger and Johnny Rockets have done to dining to the oldies what Richard Simmons has done to sweating to the oldies. That is utilize upbeat oldies to improve an experience.     Lindsey had promoted the shakes. I was stuffed. Cheeseburger Cheeseburger is obviously Cheeseburger Shakes. Their menu features 73 flavors of shakes that include cherry cheesecake, peanut butter cup, blueberry, and strawberry. On top of all this deliciousness, they can make the shake a malt. Ultimately they serve ice cream sodas. The strawberry ice cream soda is one of my favorite ice cold treats.    Leaving this 1950s and 1960s environment, I was singing \"Mother In Law\" instead of saying \"Cheeseburger Cheeseburger.\" Being in the casual burger category with major players including Five Guys and Smash Burger, Cheeseburger Cheeseburger is a Ready for Prime Time Player. In Yelp reviews that is the equivalent of four stars. In the future I plan to step back in time to treat myself to either a Cheeseburger Cheeseburger shake or strawberry ice cream soda."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband and two of my girlfriends and it was unanimous!--This place rocks! It has a casual, laid back atmosphere, and the staff is friendly and helpful. If you're in the mood for a REAL American style burger this is the spot!! The decor is right out of an American movie...retro chairs and tables, as well as the 1950's American cardboard car models used to serve fries or other. Your food comes in baskets, and your burgers are topped with olives! Flashback to NJ. The menu is varied enough to satisfy everyone, including picky customers. You can play trivia games while you wait for your food, and the kids can express their talent with colored crayons and paper.You can choose the size of your meat patty, as well as your toppings, and cheese. I had a hot-dog and it was amazing!! The others ordered a variety of burgers, and loved their meals too. Fantastic onion rings, and topped it off with a small vanilla shake! YUM!!! Spoke briefly with the owner who is an American transplant who's lived in Montreal for the past 20 years. They have a chain of these in the USA, and this is the first location in Canada. Loved everything about this place. A definite do!"}
{"text":"It's OK, I'm not going to go out of my way raving about it, but it was definitely better than Strip Burger.  At least this seems like hand pressed beef, where Stip Burger uses the preformed SYSCO patties.  The bar for me is The Great Grille from Burbank, unfortunately they are long closed due to the owner passing.  If you have your choice, go to In-N-Out or Tommys!  $40 for two including shakes, a soda, and twofer or whatever it was.  The basket of fries and rings."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect walking in here. The misspelled name should have been a sign. The place was small and pretty full. The food was pretty good overall, except for over seasoned french fries.  My biggest dislikes were the attire and professionalism of the employees. Seemed a bit inexperienced and undressed for people I want handling my food. The menu was confusing and poorly laid out.  The place had a 50's dinner feel, certainly not a ritzy upper class feel, so charging for sides separate from your burger seemed way over expensive. Maybe if the place looked nicer and the staff dressed nicer I wouldn't mind paying so much. You can choose coleslaw or side salad. The coleslaw comes in a tiny little dressing cup vs. the side salad on a nice size plate. Thankfully I ordered the side salad, but if I hadn't I'd complain about those serving proportions.   The place seems good for kids as they were running about."}
{"text":"I haven't reviewed Cheeburger Cheeburger yet? Shame, for shame. So here goes.  It's a build yer own burger joint. But hot damn is it awesome. You have the Chassis. Start with a delicious glossy moist bun. The patty, anything from 1/3 of a pound to the full-pounder. On that you can pick from an impressive array of cheeses and like the menu says, you can have it without cheese but why would you? This is followed by a plethora of free toppings and not-so-free topping, but worth every extra penny because you can go freaking nuts on the combination possibilities.  I had the semi serious, which is 1/3 of a pound and opted to slap some bacon and a fried egg, with mayo, ketchup and American Cheese. It was crazy good. The patty was piping hot, well seasoned, moist, fatty and delicious. The toppings were amazing. The bun is simply AMAZING.   I had a side of Onion Rings. The only thing I can say that's wrong about the rings is that the onions were not allowed to dehydrate overnight after being cut, when that's not done, the moisture makes the batter mushy. But they were still awesome. The fries.... poor, poor Americans. They couldn't make good French fries to save their lives. I've eaten all over in the states and only at the Navy Yard's Bistro did I find good fries, otherwise, they are always dry and crunchy. But they weren't bed, just not how I like me some fries.  All sides (fries and rings) come with a choice of 5 dipping sauces. I of course hit the melted cheese sauce... you can dip the last remains of the burger into it as well.  Wait it gets better. Made to order soft drinks served in Masson jars. Cherry Coke in a Masson jar.... just perfect. But wait again, it gets even better. Homemade milkshakes. Tasty, cool, delicious shakes, about 30 different types. I love me a good shake.  Tacky 50's decor which is cool, great service, supremely nice owner, trivial pursuit cards with the condiment tray, 50's music, lotsa pink and what is currently the best burger experience in Montreal. Nothing else comes close to it. So despite some very minor blunders, it's SERIOUS 5 outta 5"}
{"text":"Very good, but over priced.  Their strength is in the variety of ingredients that they offer, so if you are more adventurous, you will probably find something to like at this place.  If you stick to the more traditional concept of a burger, then you will probably find this place overpriced.  Their milkshake / malt selection is pretty impressive though, and worth the trip just for that."}
{"text":"Great place to take your kids to. The burgers and frys were ok."}
{"text":"I am surprised at some of the low reviews of this place. I almost didn't try it which would have been a mistake.  The service was very friendly and a lot quicker than I had expected based on previous reviewers. The restaurant itself was clean, comfortable, and had a comfortable noise level in spite of being fairly busy.  The food was great and when it comes to variety can't be beat. I had the 1/3lb cheeseburger on a wheat bun. The bun was grilled and delicious but I had to forgo most of it otherwise I never would have been able to eat as much of the burger as I did. The medium size fries was too big for a party of two so next time I will try the small. We were also very happy to have the shakes and malts come in a half size which was much more manageable than the usual size you get in restaurants.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Service was great. I ordered my burger med well and it came very well done. It was pretty dry and lacked flavor - not the best. I was not a fan of the bun. It was too big and dense. Cute atmosphere, lots of families with kids. I like how the burgers are all natural, never frozen and cooked to order. Good fries and onion rings."}
{"text":"I thought this place was freaking adorable. The staff was attentive. The burgers were were good, not die hard to eat.  But their shakes blew me away. You have so many options its overwhelmingly awesome. Plus who doesn't love a blast from the past with jukeboxes and pink wallpaper?!?"}
{"text":"morning at Hopkins  I indulge with a burger  delicious indeed   I tend to choose as early a flight as possible when flying out of Hopkins. You always have time to kill after your special TSA experience, and there are some surprising food options in the food court. Its cool, I'm glad it is not all of the standard fast food options.   That being said, I am not above eating a cheeseburger for breakfast, and I'd be lying if I said the \"Cheeburger\" wasn't pretty damn good. Three times out of three, for me.   Fresh toppings, pseudo designer beef, and a few cheese options.  I wouldn't exactly drive to the airport to get one, but I'll go out of my way for one when I'm there. Yup.   Carry on."}
{"text":"Whahhh??? None of you bitches have been to Cheeburger Cheeburger?!?!  This place is tied for first for burger chains in my book - right up there with In-N-Out.  It's like In-N-Out in that it's a small chain, and in these parts apparently NOT KNOWN.  I might commit sacrilege and say that it's actually BETTER than In-N-Out (don't smack me!) because they have a bigger menu and better fries.  (Lets face it - Out's fries suck.)  And their milkshakes are reason alone to head to this place.  The ambiance is...themey.  It's got the whole 50s diner thing going on.  At first glance you'll think the Easter Bunny threw up in there - pastel walls, pink lighting, turquoise chairs.  But once your eyes have adjusted, you'll notice it's PACKED.  Granted, with what appears to be about 5 kindergarten classes and their \"chaperones\" - but this isn't Chuck-E-Cheese fare - the burgers are for realz.    They are famous for their 20oz monster burger (called The Pounder - a misnomer - obviously weight has been adjusted to meet 21st Century America's expectations for mo bigger junk food) and if you finish it, your picture will be placed on the \"Wall of Fame\" with the other 10 year olds who accomplished the feat.  I myself go for the \"Semi-Serious\", a modest 1/3 lb (ok, 7oz) and then rationalize that with the calories saved I can gorge on fries and a large shake.  They have TONS of toppings so you can customize to your exact liking.  (hmm...banana peppers?  Or jalepenos?  How much do I want to feel this later?)  Save room for their \"Best of Both\" basket of fries and rings, and then choose from one of many sauces.    Wash down with one of like 50 milkshakes on the menu or create your own out of a zillion different ingredients to choose from. They make them fresh with real ice cream.  The Chocolate Banana Peanut Butter usually wins out, but I need to mix it up a bit, I know.    OK.  I know where I'm having lunch tomorrow..."}
{"text":"*Best Milkshake in Las Vegas*  That's right, I said it. Go ahead and try to prove me wrong. They have more flavors of milk shakes than most place have items on their menus. On top of the staggering amount of choices you have to the option to mix more than one flavor into a shake. Cheesecake Smores? Done! Coconut, mango, and pineapple? Done! This just opens the door from amazing to mindblowing. Don't even get me started on the quality of the shakes. That cheesecakse smores I just mention above, real graham cracker crumbs in it. Yes I had it, and it was delicious. A large milkshake runs around six dollars and is served in the milkshake tin, but dont let the price scare you away. It's definitely more than enough delicious milkshake to warrant forking over six dollars for. Now as for the rest of the menu......  The hamburgers offer you another array of choices in the form of toppings and size, but even with all the toppings I just could not get over the lack of flavor that the hamburger patty itself had. It's definitely not on the bad end of the scale but for the price of the hamburgers you'd expect better. Their fry and onion ring platters do serve up a large amount of food for a good price but their dipping sauces are amazingly overpriced. One dollar for a dipping sauce? Come on now. The fries are a bit soggy and mediocre but their onion rings are a lightly battered, sweet ring of deliciousness.  I hate to give Cheeburger Cheeburger three stars but the only thing I can recommend coming here for is the milkshakes and onion rings. If you're looking for a great hamburger, look somewhere else."}
{"text":"Hubby and i eat here at least once a month i love being able to turn my burger into a wrap!! They have a lot to choose from, the flavor combos are amazing. Even the left overs warm up nicely.  We have never had a problem with staff,  there is a bit of a wait to get your food but its freshly made! I love my chee burger!"}
{"text":"This was my 1st time here and it was GREAT! My server Stephanie told me how everything goes (menu wise) and that made choosing what I wanted easy. My classic burger came out hot and the way I wanted it in which I finished it all. The fries I order were hot as well and they were okay. I ordered a milkshake to go and it was perfect(actually started on it before leaving the restaurant). Overall whenever I'm on this side of town I know where I can go for a fulfilling meal."}
{"text":"I wanted to get something different for my kids to eat instead of always going to Del Taco(Which is our go to fast food of all time). I was looking for burger places online and came across the Cheeseburger Cheeseburger site. It was either Smash Burger or this place and I decided to go here. I went there and ordered two kids  meals cheeseburgers for take out. One with bacon and the other with pickles with. a side of fries with one meal and onion rings with the other The cashier was nice and friendly. When my order was ready I didn't bother to check it and so when I got home I opened my children's meals and was so disappointed. They didn't any bacon I was charged for and they were shady with the onion rings. There were literally 3 to 4 pieces of onion rings! Mine kids didn't bother finishing their meal. I tasted one of their burger and it was so bland. Never again will I go back there because I wasted $17 bucks for two kids meals that were not all that great.......I wish I can go back into time and go to Smash Burger instead."}
{"text":"You walk in and are almost immedietly blinded by the Pink Neon.....  after a few minutes your eyes adjust to the brightness and you can focus on the Kitchy decorations- and you feel like you stepped back in time a bit.  I must say I love the idea behind the place- it has unbelievable potential- and this may seem wierd but what I feel the problem is, nothing there is made with LOVE/PASSION.....  stay with me... I have been there twice, as I didn't think it was fair to give up after one try we all have bad days....  but the same thing came through both times....  the people cooking the food dont care about the food. Example...  I asked my server what shake combination they would recommend, the only thing is I wanted to have it malted that was my only request- the response to me was- I am lactose intollerant and do not drink them, and this same person is the one who ultimetely ended up making my malt, which was runny and nothing special....  Add some love and this may justify the higher than normal prices..... if not just expect to pay too much for an average burger..."}
{"text":"Takes very long to get your food and it seems to me that it's a hang out for the employees.. as I'm writing this review there's about 15 employees just hanging out and once again our order is taking long..they are just making food for the employees and I have been here for about 40 min and there's only 3 other customers I give this place a 3 star because it's not properly managed..the food is great though because I have eaten at the original one on rainbow"}
{"text":"I showed up here about 15mins before closing time, and got brusque but friendly service.  I went with a burger and a mushroom poutine. The burger was solid, and I would definitely go back and eat there again.  The menu has a ridiculous amount if toppings available to choose from, and so I don't remember exactly what I got. I've come to expect a large number of topping options here in North America, but even with high expectations this place killed it with the toppings.  The poutines have a decent selection of ingredients to choose from too, and I really rate their mushroom version. The gravy was thick and dark, which I'm a big fan of - if you've never tried a poutine in Quebec, ignore that last sentence and just know it's good.  The decor is 50's/60's burger joint (with lots of neon lighting), which is pretty par for the course these days (not bad, but not good).  Just remember there's no 'S' in the name of this place! I'd been thinking of going here for a month before I realised that it's \"Chee\"burger - what's with that?!"}
{"text":"So last night was one of those nights, where I didn't feel like cooking for myself or even less cleaning the leftover mess. I had promised myself that I would try Cheeburger since I had begun following them on twitter last week ( http://twitter.com/CheeburgerMTL ) I made my way over there around 7:30 PM after having spent just enough time sitting in front of my laptop replying to emails and making like what I do will save the world.   I have to say that on a dark rainy evening in January Cheeburgers's store front doesn't exactly scream \"Here I am\" as I drove by it without even noticing it on my first go around the block, even after parking and walking up the road it still didn't jump out at me.   Once I'd found it and made my way in I was greeted by a very friendly staff member who said hello and then asked me where I would prefer to sit as the place was almost empty, as one would expect on a rainy Monday evening. I pointed towards the counter and she promptly said that I would have a great view of the kitchen from there, with an enthusiastic tone.  I sat down and the waitress asked if it was my first time here, I said yes and she opened the menu in front of me and gave me a crash course in Cheeburger. The menu isn't particularly complicated with 4 different sized burgers and a variety of wraps and sandwiches, not to mention Onion rings and fries. The impressive part is the list of cheese and condiments (most free) that are listed, you know they have lots of condiments when Peanut Butter is on the  list. I ordered a classic burger with Swiss, guacamole, hot peppers and pickle http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RK5YJ01Rla3nLOTe7JPktA?select=Ek6X-g3e-T3cv4lalvuL6A  . As I mentioned I follow Cheeburger on Twitter and one of the things they tweet is a weekly promotion, last week you got a free milkshake when you mentioned the magic word, this week it was a free beer when you said Yummy.I said Yummy!  My Beer arrived with a frosty cold glass (nice touch) about 10 minutes before my burger and fries but once the burger arrived I almost forgot the beer was there! I'm not a big eater quantity wise but I love burgers and I always find that most burger place try to make up for so so meat by giving you a massive burger but not this place. I ordered the smallest size, the \"Original\" cooked medium expecting the same thing as in most burger joints, an overcooked tough patty but was I wrong! My burger arrived cooked exactly the way I had asked and when I was done I wanted to order another one, good thing I had some fries because if I hadn't I would have ordered a second one for sure. As for the fries they nice and crispy cooked in peanut oil to give them the nice old fashion flavour but next to the burger they didn't stand out, which in my opinion is a good thing. The fries should never out shine the burger. Since I had the free beer on this visit I didn't get a chance to try the milkshakes but if I the variety of flavours available on the menu is any indication I would suggest giving them a try, I plan on it next time I stop in for a burger.  The decor is vintage American diner, with lots of stainless steel and neon lights, in this case all the neon's are pink giving the place a pink Cadillac feel. I'm not a huge fan of the pink but that's just my taste and and really isn't a draw back since other then that the place is clean and well kept, the staff are courteous and efficient , the food is excellent and they have something for everyone, except maybe vegetarians.  I think what I appreciate most about Cheeburger is the fact that all they are trying to be is a burger place, plain and simple, no pretentiousness, just good food. Next time you're in the downtown core shopping step out of the underground maze of shopping centers and give this place a try."}
{"text":"Good  family place for a create your own meal. From burgers to shakes invent what you will."}
{"text":"Ok, so I was starving, and found myself wanting a cheeseburger badly.  This place seemed so promising when entering, but overall, its mediocre at best.  I ate at the bar, and the service was mediocre.  The gentleman who helped me seemed alright, but something was lacking.  I can't put my finger on it, but it was lame service, ya know?   Somewhere in between lack of entusiasium and bland.  The food itself was okay, and I guess if your at Tempe Marketplace, and are dying for a cheeseburger (like I was) I would say 'lets just go here.'  I would not go out of my way to dine here."}
{"text":"Bread is super dry and covered in flour. Burger was bland. Not much good to say really. Carpets were gross, service was non-existent. Some of the apps were decent. Won't go again."}
{"text":"If ordering online, I extremely recommend that instead of the mandatory 25 minute wait before you swing by to pick up your food, go ahead and pick up your order about 15 minutes after you place it.  I picked up my order right at 25 minutes and when I opened it to chow down at home EVERYTHING was soggy.   The burger was a bit cold and my fries were cold too except for the middle.  I wish they would at least call me to tell me my food was ready."}
{"text":"Went here last week right before closing (we didn't know!) and service was excellent! Yanno.. usually when you're the last ones they rush you.. but not here!   We sat down behind a couple of guys that finished the Pounder and they got their picture taken to put on the wall. They flashed the lights and shouted out so the whole place could here. It was entertaining..  I'd say this place gets 3.5 stars. Amazed at the amount of toppings they offer.. but the burger patty itself was a little disappointing. =( The toppings helped alot with enhancing the flavor but I prefer a burger that almost doesn't need any toppings and then I pile em on anyway. lol. Loved that guacamole was included in the FREE toppings cuz usually its almost $1 extra. yum! Also had the onion rings and fries. The cheese sauce is deeeeelicious! Fries were fresh and hot and kinda crispy but not toooo crispy. Perfect!  I definitely will go back to try to eat the Pounder. I saw there was only one chick up on that wall and I'm about to be second!"}
{"text":"if it's good enough for flavor flav it's good enough for me. No really they make a good burger here, and there are so many options. I love that when I asked if they used the same fried for the fried mushrooms as they do for the fries they looked into it for me, and another guest, and they use separate fryers. personally a burger is better with a fried egg, and peppers on it ;-D here you can do that and a whole lot more."}
{"text":"Okay little burger joint, not bad but nothing spectacular.  In a town inundated with burger places you'll find better."}
{"text":"When the business owner goes out of his or her way to make things right, I listen. Invited for another try, I  stopped in last night and met the owner - a very nice, professional fellow. I kept it simple to truly evaluate their performance and I'm delighted to report that this location is top notch. First, the shake was everything I could ask for. Creamy, flavorful, the right touch of malt - delicious. The burger was what we call back East a \"cheeseburger special\" - ¼ # burger with Swiss, lettuce, tomato, onion and mayo - toasted roll. Money! We sometimes get carried away with too many choices, so this 'sample' was flavorful, perfectly cooked and stacked.  When in the neighborhood, give it a try."}
{"text":"Got some burgers for takeout... Saw that it was supposedly the best burger in 29 cities and it had great Yelp reviews.  I'm not sure which cities this statistic is referring to, but I've had much better burgers in Las Vegas alone.  The really awesome thing is that they have different sized burgers, so you can get a small (5 oz) or extremely large (20 oz) burger and put almost anything you want on it.  They have toppings I would never think try, like artichoke hearts, banana peppers, etc.  They have several different types of cheese including feta, mozzarella, provolone, etc.  Unfortunately I wasn't feeling too adventurous so I got the Semi-Serious (1/3 lb burger) with bleu cheese, 2 onion rings, bbq sauce and lettuce.  The burger was good, a little bit chunky for me on the meat for me, I probably should have gone with the smallest burger.  My boyfriend ordered a medium burger and it was delivered well done, but still good.  The fries were pretty good, I wouldn't RAVE about them, but they were good. I've never had fries with the skin still on them, and they were pretty tasty with the seasonings.  I'd like to try the milkshake and onion rings and probably be more adventurous with my burger next time, I would definitely try this place again and I'd say everyone is different when it comes to burgers, so this place is worth a try."}
{"text":"Great burgers, excellent onion rings, fabulous milkshakes. We go here whenever we're in the mood for a burger."}
{"text":"This would easily be a 5-star rating if the review were based on food alone.  However, the service has to be considered.  We waited at least 15 minutes before our drink order was even taken and waited quite a while for drink refills.  The food was absolutely amazing though! Onion rings without the grease and incredible burgers!   I definitely recommend!  Just go with the understanding that the service will be less than great!"}
{"text":"OMG!!!! This place is the BEST!!!! The food is outstanding. The shakes are out of this world. Go...eat...enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"The Cheeburger chain (that is NOT a spelling error) has been around since the 80s. While not as well-known as most dine-in chains, they have maintained a small but loyal following.  I discovered this restaurant when I won a free lunch there through a radio station promotion. Since then, I haven't stopped going back. Essentially, the restaurant is a 50s-style diner (with appropriate decor and music playing), serving a good variety of classic American food (burgers, chicken fingers, fries, etc.) All the food they make is excellent.  What makes Cheeburger stand out is customization. The restaurant lets you create your own burger/chicken sandwich from tons of options, and even lets you mix and match malt/shake flavors! The staff take care of the customers and always have smiles on their faces. Not to mention if the malts and shakes aren't enough, there is a plethora  of other dessert dishes to choose from.  My one complaint is that there is only one location in town - halfway across the city from my house. Still,I can't fault the restaurant based on where I live.  Cheeburger is excellent, and it's a shame the restaurant isn't more popular than it is. Don't pass this place by. It's the ultimate 50s diner experience.  Food: B Atmosphere: A- Service: A-"}
{"text":"I like this place. Its a little pricey cause they charge for everything, including dipping sauce. But it taste good."}
{"text":"With a name like Cheeburger times 2, you don't have to guess what their specialty is.  What most diners in the area don't know is that Cheeburger Cheeburger is actually a chain with over 50 locations!    Walking in, newbies will be surprised by the 50s-inspired diner atmosphere.  Their menu definitely takes some time to navigate, but you'll get the hang of it.  Burgers - their main focus and what everyone really comes for.  You can have your meat cooked to your liking (medium, medium well, well) and in various sizes (5.5 oz, 7 oz, 10 oz, 14 oz).  Apparently, they have their own farm where the beef comes from.  What makes them over the top is the number of toppings available.  Things like sun-dried tomatoes, avocado, and artichoke hearts are only a sample of their 25 plus topping selection.  The Husband went for The Semi-Serious (7 oz) for $6.99.  With nine types of cheeses to choose from, he went for the Pepper Jack Cheese and a fair amount of toppings.  Melissa G. went for The Classic (5.5 oz) Wrap for $6.79.  She also added a few toppings too.  If it's not meat you crave, portabello mushroom and veggie burgers and wraps are also available.  Salads are also hearty on the toppings with over 25 choices to choose from.  I went for the Portabello Wrap for $7.99.  They offer white or whole wheat wraps and you get a signature sauce to dip your wrap in.  My wrap was okay, perhaps there's so much stuff going on that it's hard to enjoy the actual taste of the wrap itself.  We couldn't resist their \"Famous Fries & Rings\" and wanted to go for the \"Best of Both\" Basket, Regular order ($5.89), but the waitress dissuaded us by saying it was huge and we should really get a Half ($4.69).  Apparently, she underestimated our craving for fried foods, and we ended up ordering up another basket of fries (Small $2.59 / Medium $3.59 / Large $4.59).  We weren't too fond of the onion rings, but we did like the fries.  They also offer five signature sauces, so we did the Adventurous Flight of Three ($2.49).  Since two of us ordered wraps, we ended up trying all five - Creamy Cheese, Zesty Horseradish, Creamy Jalapeno, Sweet Pepper, and Garden Vegetable.  We overdid it with the sauces and maybe should have just chosen one for our fries.  They weren't anything special unfortunately.    But the real winner is their milkshake selection.  With over 378,00 possible combinations, you can build any kind of milkshake you want.  The waitress did point out that once you get past the three topping combination, there's an excess of syrup as most of the toppings are syrup-based. (So, be sure to ask the staff what toppings are concrete versus syrup.)  I went for the Oreo Green Mint, Cookie Dough, and Heath Bar combination and it was REALLY good.  The Husband went for the Pina Colada and Berry Berry combo and his was pretty good too!  Melissa G. has Chocolate Banana Peanut Butter with Reese's Pieces.  They serve them up in two sizes - Half $3.59 or Regular $4.99.    Service was okay, the waitresses were super friendly in the beginning but slacked off a bit as more business arrived and our section was left empty.  (We were seated in the back section, although they ended up closing it off and seating everyone else in the front.)  When it comes down to it, we paid over $50 for dinner and that was not including tip.  Pretty expensive meal for a party of three at a diner.  For those who know what toppings to pick, you can get a better bang for your buck.  But if you prefer the no frills on your burgers, this place is not for you.  We'd go back for the shakes and fries, but not for the rings, burgers or wraps."}
{"text":"Great selection of shakes though the consistency of the shakes is lacking. The burger is good as they keep things simple."}
{"text":"If you don't mind the price it is a great place to go wild in. You can create your burgers, shakes, soda, etc anyway you want.  I loved being able to make a chocolate/root beer malt. The burgers come in multiple sizes. Service was good. If it wasn't so expensive I would go more often. Decor was 1950's soda fountain style."}
{"text":"Upon entering Cheeburger Cheeburger, I had high expectations.  I mean, any place that decides to name themselves after a reference in SNL's Olympia Cafe sketch should be good, right?  I went with several friends and we were hungry!  One of my friends even went as far as to order the full pound burger.  As soon as we walked in I was immediately turned off.  There were a good amount of gnats hovering amidst the whole front bar area. I figured it was from the fluorescent lighting inside and they were being attracted inside from the dark, so we chose to sit outside.  I do have to say I was impressed by the fact that I could get myself a Chocolate Coke and that it took me way to long to actually decide on what toppings I wanted on my burger.  The selection of drink flavors and burger toppings is certainly not lacking.  However, upon getting the food, I was less than impressed for a place that prides themselves to the point of putting their product in their business name.  The service was slow.  After my friend finished his full pound burger- the employees were not thrilled at all to have to take his picture with the Stuffed Cheeburger and put it up on the Wall of Fame.  I would think this would be the most exciting part of their job!  I don't think I would give it a second chance if I was craving a juicy burger again. I'd rather drive down the street and grab a delectable In-N-Out Burger Animal Style- spending less money and leaving much more satisfied."}
{"text":"Service, slow and it was empty. Took 15 min. To get drinks! Burgers were dry. Bread tasted old. The fries had a weird taste to them. Maybe undercooked? Only thing good was the rings. Much prefer Fuddruckers.  Such a disappointment as we use to go to the one in Florida all the time and it was good!"}
{"text":"So we have been driving by the one on Rainbow in southwest for about a year now and saw this newly opened gem while we were getting our pictures taken near by. While we waited for the pictures to print, we decided to try this place. The food was pretty good and the service was fantastic. Definitely  worth a visit."}
{"text":"I have been here several times for lunch and dinner. It has always been good This time  I had the semi serious burger, fries/ onion rings and iced tea. The burger was really good. Nice and juicy. I love that you have so many choice of toppings! Service was very good."}
{"text":"This is a great place if you have a burger craving! They have so many toppings to choose from! I had the semi serious burger with cheddar cheese and guacamole, it was awesome! We ordered an order of fries for the table which were very tasty! My daughter got a banana shake that was really good. Lots of Shake flavors too. They also have salads and wraps. The whole staff is super nice and we had great service! I am so happy that there is a location on my side of town! I will be back! This is my favorite burger place!"}
{"text":"I went here for a friends Bday.  I lived nearby and passed it so many times without ever giving it a thought because of its bland exterior.  Wow, how different it was inside.  A retro interior design with posters and wall papers that take you back to the 60's, only thing missing was a jukebox, unless I just happen to not see it.  They won me over with James Dean life size poster on the men's restroom door.  I'm a huge James Dean fan, no homo.  Now as far as the food goes, it was great as well.  You decide what you want on the burger and if you finish a 1 pounder, you get a picture taken and posted on the wall with the other future heart attack wall of fame.  The fries we're great also, the type of fries you usually find at great philly cheese steak joints.  And it wouldn't be retro without the milkshake.  I got the oreo milkshake which was worth taking a dump over because I'm lactose intolerant.    They were serving around 20 of us and we were pretty rowdy.  The server held her cool and was pretty much nice to us the entire time.  Fun great staff, retro style joint, good food, a definite thumbs up in my opinion."}
{"text":"They've won me over now that I think about it more.  I had them at 3 stars in 2011. I've been back a few times and had a chance to compare them to other places.   I appreciate the fact that Cheeburger has waitress service where their competitors don't necessarily do that. I appreciate that they have more menu choice.   In the world of casual burger chains, I take this place over Shake Shack. I might take it over Five Guys if I'm in the mood for more than a burger, though Five Guys is a better burger (most of the time)."}
{"text":"Holy crap is this place good.  With the gazillion milkshake flavors to choose from, I had vanilla....... kinda anti-climatic I know. Next time though.  The burgers were huge with 20 some odd topings to choose from. I had onions and pickles...... I know, another let down. Next time I sware.  Also the onion rings are tops here. Fries looked good too.  The decore is a nice 50's diner type with very friendly staff.  Outdoor seating is nice when it's not hot out and it's very close to the theatre which makes it the perfect stop before seeing Mama Mia........ J/K on that one. Saw Batman."}
{"text":"Very good service...haven't been here in over 10 years.  Had a Semi-Serious burger, which tasted fresh.  You get to choose toppings, etc, which are listed on the menu.  Had the medium (sharing size) fries, which tasted like fresh-cut.  My friends had shakes, which they also liked.  Waitress was very nice and kept out drinks filled.  Would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"We like 5 Guys and people told us it was similar.  Good burgers, lots of topping, decent fried and rings, but we were underwhelmed.  Probably won't go back.  We had a \"buy 1, get one at 50%\" coupon, so thought we'd give it a try.  Many size options, prices, not bad, ($6.99 for a 1/3# burger), lots of topping, but.....  We order2 burgers Medium Well.  (No pink inside)  My wife's was pretty rare, and mine was also medium to medium rare.  We were hungry and didn't want to waste time sending it back, so we told the server our disappointment.  She gave us a free small shake, but we still had a pink, cool-center burgers, which were order Medium Well.  Fries weren't fresh from fryer since they weren't crispy, but floppy.  The onion rings were alright.  Even the water which my wife ordered with the lemon \"on the side\" came with the lemon in the glass.  They've been open at this location for quite a while, so you'd think they have it right by now.  Maybe this explains why they have lost locations elsewhere, like one in Michigan I always wanted to visit.  But by the time their traffic slowed down, they were closed, without warning.  Sorry, but for the money, we'll stick with 5 Guys, or a new place in DT Las Vegas....Flippin' Good Burgers, which opened a bit ago to great reviews.  We just want a good burger, but this place.....shouldn't have to send a Medium Well burger back for being served rare.  Mooooooo..."}
{"text":"my husband & i went here tonight for the first time. we also brought our 2 & 4 year old kids.  the kids split the kids meal (one kid's meal was the perfect amount of food for two toddlers to share). my husband got a portobello burger and a large basket of fries & onion rings. i got a veggie burger and nothing else.  the burgers were both HUGE - even the veggie burger patty was large. and the basket of fries & rings was large.   food was good. total bill was around $35. not horrible - but for one complete meal, one extra veggie burger and one kid's meal - it was a bit higher than expected for burgers. add a tip and we're in $45 for burgers & fries.  we probably won't go again, but i do think this place would be great for someone who is really into good burgers & fries.   like others have said, our family could have gone to a pretty nice restaurant and spent around the same amount of money.  i'm giving it 4 stars -  because i didn't get food poisoning, my kids had fun (and their food was served with a paper car to play with), my husband said his mushroom burger was amazing, and the service was good. the place seemed relatively clean - everyone was friendly."}
{"text":"Cheeburger, Cheeburger!  It's a restaurant called Cheeburger, Cheeburger!!  The little kid in me squealed with delight.   Like pasghetti and sammiches, cheeburgers are one of those willfully mispronounced foodstuffs that bring back a little nostalgia. They remind me of those rare days when we'd all pile in my chain smoking babysitter's Caddy and cruise to McD's for cheeburgers, cheapo happy meal toys, and a romp in the pee covered ball pin.   Urine, second hand smoke, and cheeburgers. I couldn't fathom a better combination at that age.  Then again we didn't have Cheeburger, Cheeburgers when I was a kid. If we did I'd be eating my kid's meal out of a super sweet pink hot rod that looks almost identical to the Barbie mobile, sippin' my hand shaken soda and munchin' on a cheeburger, American, ketchup. I'm in my twenties but I still wanted one of those little card stock car boxes, even if my taste in toppings has become a bit more adventurous.  Just because my tastebuds have matured doesn't make me any more decisive now than I was then. Not a good thing with a place that boasts 50 or so toppings for you burger (or chicken sandwich, or salad-- they're all based on the same \"every order is a special order\" model). I didn't even attempt to figure out what kind of fancy pants shake or soda flavor I wanted (100 flavors, people! 100!!) and just kept it simple with a glass of water in a mason jar. The fries vs. onion rings debate was also too heated, but a basket of crisp and delicious frings came to the rescue. The onion rings were thin and lightly battered, definitely the better of the two options, and the fries were fresh cut and uber greasy, just how I like 'em, even if they were under-salted.  In the end I went with a Classic green chile cheddar burger with the traditional fixins (lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, mustard, ketchup). It was cooked to a perfect medium and the price was right, ringing in at about 5 bucks. I agree that the top bun was way too big in comparison to the bottom, but I solved that by shaving half of it off so I could wrap my mouth around that thick slab of meat, because let's face it people, the bun is just filler. It's all about the meat. It was messy and juices were dripping all over my face, and I must have gone through at least four paper towels, but hot diggity damn, it was a great burger.  The smallest burger possible (the Classic) is about five ounces or so and they increase incrementally until you reach the big mamba jamba 20 ounce 'nother nail in the coffin coronary on a bun. I can't even guess how many pieces of cheese it takes to cover that beast. I did however witness two people finish this outrageous burger while I was enjoying my dainty (by comparison) fare. Both gastric champions had their pictures taken with a gigando stuffed cheeburger (I would have worn it as a hat), and then had their image pasted on the wall of shame...err...fame.  My inner child's parting words are: \"Cheeburger! Cheeburger! Go eat cheeeeeburgerrrrrs!\"  My more mature counterpart: \"Ahem, a myriad of combinations are possible between burgers, shakes and sides, variety enough to satisfy even the most discerning of palates and leave everyone...CHEEBURGER!!!\"  P.S. Fuck Red Robin in its bony little chicken wing. This place is miles ahead of that bland dump."}
{"text":"Now, I am not saying that the meaty patties here are the best in the business. I had a veggie burger, and honestly, it wasn't the best veggie burger I have had. It was big, but a little dry and more of a grain patty than a fake meat variety. I have decided I prefer fake meat. I really should have gone for the turkey burger... or the 1lb burger challenge. Sometimes you just gotta have the real deal.   However, I am still a fan for a couple of reasons. First, from build your own salads for the vegetarian to the 1lb burger for the overachievers, there is definitely something for everyone. Second, there are a million ways to customize everything. Generally, this makes me a bit crazy, but I appreciated the choices. Numerous toppings for your burger and your salad, a gazillion milkshake flavors. Heck, you can even create a custom-flavored soda!  I had the platter which comes with a salad or coleslaw and rings or fries. It was $12, which may be bordering on pricey, but for some reason I did not mind. The salad came in a bowl (a decent size), and it was not iceberg! Brilliant!  And, I liked both their fries and their onion rings. Their fries were homemade, sliced not too thin or too thick, and served with a little bit of skin still on. The onion rings were lightly battered, skinny and delicious. Some people might prefer a big, fat onion ring, but I found this skinny variety rather addictive. They were just so easy to squash, dip and then slam in your mouth! Dangerously simple consumption.   The decor is retro diner, which leaves me neutral. I neither adore nor detest this theme.   As for service, I found it pleasant, organized and fairly prompt given that there were close to 20 in the party! They were accommodating and as far as I could tell, they did not mess up anyone's order-- rather impressive considering all of the customization that was going down!"}
{"text":"We have been going here for a few years and take friends many times because the Burgers are a great combination of build your own and excellent Firs, Onion Rings and variety of shakes and floats. What I am sick of is Mediocre service and untrained, inattentive wait staff who have no clue on how to treat customers. Our Waitress (maybe 17-18 years old) had one table, ours yet couldn't manage to find the time to stop by, refill drinks, or properly take the order as it came out wrong. She did have plenty of time to \"hang\" by the grill window and chat with the cooks and other staff while our drinks sat un refilled for about 7 or 8 minutes. The other waitress seemed on top of her game, but the woman whom I guessing is in charge or related to the owners or Manager are oblivious to what goes on. Yet there is always time to check your phone and text because that is more important then a paying and tipping person whom is 15 feet from your location. Who ever hires and trains these people should be ashamed but if you like a good burger and 50's atmosphere, then give it a try."}
{"text":"Overpriced, but filling portions.  The Cheeburger Platter was decent value, but the onion rings were far too salty.  Good thing I had a float to wash it down. Someday, restos will stop serving those horrid, indigestible white bread buns, too.  Noisy, youthful crowd.  Interesting music choices; they play '60s ye-ye tunes mixed with American oldies hits.  Friendly staff, though."}
{"text":"Although I ordered my burger medium, it came out dry and tasteless. The topping list is great, but as many have mentioned the extra charges here border on ridiculous . When I'm order $6 worth of fries/onion rings you can't throw in some sauce for free?  The shake we created (for $5.49 mind you) was really delicious, but I haven't met a shake I didn't love!!   A decent burger, but with LBS, Burger Bar, Strip Burger, In n Out, BLT, etc all in our fair city it's hard for me to get excited for this place !"}
{"text":"I LOVED this place! I think what sets this place apart is having CHOICES. Everything is made HOW YOU WANT IT and the best part is that they have so many choices and flavors for you to choose from. Not to mention the quality was superb.   MUST TRY: THE MILKSHAKES, with plenty of flavors to choose from, I cannot stress how delicious this babies are! And you have the option to MIX flavors.   I reccommend if you're going to try the 1 Pound burger challenge, then you dont get extras (fries, milshakes..etc) with your meal. I was able to finish a Dilerious 3/4 pound and it was HUGE.   Great and friendly service, great spot for friends and family, and even a cute little romantic spot! Great for lunch and dinner!   Repeat EAT :D"}
{"text":"5 stars for the food, but come on! The Fifties diner thing is way past getting old. I almost left when I walked in the door. 50's mixed with  cafeteria style tables and chairs. But when I saw the food they were bringing out I swallowed my pride and put my arrogance in my back pocket. The food was great albeit unhealthy. I will probably make it back sometime."}
{"text":"We are driving to find a new place for lunch and guess what we found...Cheeburger!!! The place is very clean and well organized, good location and not problem for parking,customer service is awesome Sandy explained everything on the menu and offer lunch specials,she answer all our questions  nice and friendly, the bathrooms are very clean, the food is excellent!! We enjoyed the hamburgers every bite, the shakes are delicious!! I will recommended this place, we are definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Descent, this was a chain I have been wanting to try but never came across in our area. I was expecting it to look a bit nicer, this location seems a bit run down/outdated. The girls working were nice though and for the fact that we showed up at 8.30 pm and they close at 9 they will still friendly even if we made them have to close an hour late. The reason I had wanted to go is the huge menu of free toppings for burgers and salads and they did raise a brow when I said I wanted EVERY topping on my salad. That is over 20 mind you and I got all this for just over $6. Pretty damn good, it was tasty too, not gourmet by any means but filling after a long day on the road. The man got the pounder for which he got his picture taken and put on their wall. He ate it cuz he was hungry not to get on the wall but said it was pretty good. My son noticed after ordering his kids meal that they also have a half pound challenge for kids and was pretty dissapointed when they said it was too late to switch his order. Other than that he enjoyed his meal as well. The prices are fair, they have the biggest selection of shakes I have ever seen, I was more than tempted to get one with about 20 different flavors but talked myself out of it once I saw all they use is flavored syrup and none of the actual fruits/candies its supposed to taste like. In all a fun dinner but not worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"Drove by the location a couple of times, but finally had the opportunity to visit for lunch with a coworker in tow.  50s diner theme aside, our friendly server was quick to seat us and introduce us to the menu.  I liked the build-your-own burger menu, and was pleased with the freshness of the toppings.  The freshly made beef patty was a nice change of pace from the typical frozen kind, though a little seasoning in the meat would have been nice.  Everything, including the fries, were cooked just right, and without that greasy feeling.  It's definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"Love the onion rings, all the toppings choices and the kaiser buns. Wonderful milkshakes , too . Delicious !"}
{"text":"The atmosphere in this place is great! Reminds me of a classic diner from the 1950's. However, the food fell short from what I consider a GREAT burger. Although Cheeburger offers a wild selection of toppings and customization - the execution of said burger was nothing more than mediocre. For what it's worth my girlfriend really liked it. I just expected more"}
{"text":"I expected more from this place, especially being pregnant and craving anything and everything in sight. I expected that a place with the word \"burger\" in it twice would have blow-your-mind burgers. The burgers were OK and the buns were just disappointingly hard and uninspiring.  Very much enjoyed the swiss chocolate milkshake. In fact, I've been craving it ever since having it. There are about a million milkshake flavors I want to try there but since the first one I had was so amazing I don't think I'd ever choose anything else. But I don't want to make a special trip back to this place for an average burger and an awesome milkshake.   The service was OK, I guess. A TON of very young workers kind of walking around like chickens without heads.   I think there are some kinks to work out. I prefer Five Guys... or Red Robin... or a long list of other burger joints besides this place."}
{"text":"Some of the tastiest burgers in town! Friendly staff, awesome malts/shakes and fast service make this restaurant a good place to visit. You can come to this restaurant to enjoy a burger with all the toppings you can imagine (most of them are free!), fries and a shake for less than $20. Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"This place has overall good food and drinks. The atmosphere is nice, giving you that feeling that you're in a 50s-style diner. The only issue I always have with this place is their service. They are always slow with the food, and the waiters/waitresses are nowhere to be found when you need them. There have been a couple of times where customers who have walked in after me received their food earlier than I have. Plus, it's not like the place is packed for them to be slow. But in the end, they do have good food."}
{"text":"So I have now been here many times and I have to say that my previous review must have been from an amazing night here.   The last few times I was here the burger quality has gone downhill significantly. The tomatoes were green and crunchy. The lettuce was white or almost white. The bread was either stale or soggy. The meat was under or over cooked. Not good.   We used to come here for their amazing shakes. The last bunch of times I've been here their shakes have been lackluster. They have obviously changed their ice cream supplier. They were using high quality and now it's probably equal to off brand at Walmart. I probably won't be back!"}
{"text":"The options here are almost endless. With the bevy of toppings and countless combinations, you could come here on a regular basis and not get the same burger twice if you chose to.   For most, the draw of customizing your own burger is a deal sealer, but for me it made for a random burger that sunk in my stomach. The platter deals are a great price at $11.99. You get a 1/2 burger (ask for a bun if you want one.), a side of fries or onion rings, a signature dipping sauce, and a choice of a side salad or coleslaw. I got mine with grilled onions, tomatoes, lettuce, pickles, peppers, A1 steak sauce, and horseradish. It was ok in flavor, but the patty fell apart. The horseradish does not deliver the kick I had hoped for either. The buns are big and soft. I could only eat the bottom piece because it was too much. The fries were seasoned well, but soggy. The salad was impressive. It was a mound of mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, croutons, olives, cheese and slice carrots. Way better than most burger places. The balsamic dressing was delicious. I shared the sides with a friend and was beyond stuffed.   Although their shakes and desserts sound amazing, there was no room for anything else."}
{"text":"Tired of fast food? don't wanna break the bank? In the mood for a cheeseburger or/and a milkshake?...try this place. Diner atmosphere, great staff, child/family friendly. The burgers are good, you can pick your toppings and the size of your burger. Try the Pounder challenge and get your picture on the wall of fame. They're pretty tasty, can be a tad greasy, but it's a burger, it's not supposed to be healthy. The fries and onion rings (portions are big) are ok nothing great, add dipping sauces if you wish. One of the best parts of the menu is the astonishing list of milkshake varieties. You'll never get to try every one, there's over a million combinations."}
{"text":"Cheeburger is a super cute 50's themed diner that specializes in you guessed it, cheeseburgers.  They have fun trivia cards and Hall of Fame photo albums on every table.  (Jump to last paragraph for more on the HOF albums.)  I'm amused by their paper towels; each table comes with a giant roll like you think of in your home kitchen.  You really will need quite a few to keep up with the yummy goodness that oozes from your burger upon every bite.  I wish that I could rate food quality and service quality separately.  Their food is a definitive 5 star, while the service deserves a big egg.  So, I'm gonna split the difference and offer up a 3 star.  The service is PAINFULLY bad, and this has been consistently the case on every visit.  I'll leave it at that, but you've been warned.  If you feel that you are brave and in a very patient mood, give this place a shot.  They have every topping that you've ever considered and  never thought of to add to your cheeseburger.  I highly recommend the chopped garlic, which adds a magical quality to your Cheeburger.  And if you are in the mood for something indulgent order one of their shakes.  They bring them out to the table in the big metal mixing cup, which is really fun.  My personal favorite (due to personal palatial prefs) is the pistachio shake.    Bring your appetite because portions are quite large.  They have a massive burger called a Pounder, which is actually 20 ounces.  If you finish this burger they take your picture and put it in their Hall of Fame photo books.  I've never attempted to wrestle this beast.  Maybe one day."}
{"text":"This place was actually really good for a burger joint. The ladies/servers had their hair pin up style and I totally dig it! Goes with the decor of the place. I ordered the serious burger and holy cow it was big! You get to choose your toppings and bun. They do take their time making your burger so I do not suggest going here if you are in a hurry. The only down fall is they charge you for fries instead of making it a combo deal."}
{"text":"It was a Thursday evening, around 6:30pm, the dinning room was packed, but we manage to get a seat.  It seems there are only two people working the dinning room, and they are running around too busy to take our drinks.  Finally someone came and we ordered.  What seemed like a long time, our hamburgers finally arrived.  I had what looked like a magnificent burger, only to discover my 1/2 lb patty was so small and lopsided, it only covered 1/3 of the bun.  I cut the burger in half and began to eat, only to find that very few bites had an actual patty in it.  Since I have enjoyed many a burger, this place was is not on my go list.  I think the golden arches servers better!  Too bad."}
{"text":"I had a Groupon voucher for this restaurant, and I went with my husband. I thought the burger was okay, but my husband was not happy. The bun is almost three times the size of the patty. The toppings? Most of them are actually sauces, not toppings.   If we had to choose between Cheeburger Cheeburger or Harvey's, we'd pick Harvey's. Cheeburger was also pretty expensive. We got nothing extra at all, not even a beverage and it was still about $25.00.   We were placed right by the door and it was freezing each time someone opened the door to come in or leave (although it wasn't all that busy).   Not a great experience and we won't go back again. Sorry Cheeburger Cheeburger!"}
{"text":"Our bill had errors!!! We checked in with yelp deal and was supposed to get BOB but was charged! Then we ordered the dinner special for 9.99 but was still charged $2.49 for the drink! Service was ok but I server rushed and didn't seem to take a real interest in us as customers.  We have been here a few times but everytime it is a hit and miss.  After this we prob won't be back unless we are desperate for a burger.  They don't even offer \"protein style\" so I opted for the wheat wrap but it was a $1.00 up charge.  Oh well.....we tried.  Prob better off at Five Guys (they have the cool coke machine with sugar free options)!"}
{"text":"The burgers are good, the fries are okay...  but the custom milkshakes are to die for.  I go for that reason alone.  Hells ya!  Cheesecake flavored milkshake, blueberries, cookie dough, etc etc etc.  Oh man, that's good stuff.  I hate the decor but you can get a milkshake to go and life is right."}
{"text":"Interesting concept with customizable hamburgers with about 50 or so ingredients you can put on a burger. The burger was good, not great, but good. However I felt their onion rings & french fries were horrible and that they charge you for flavor sauces like jalapeno ranch and cheese ($.99 for a little tiny cup). They also give you unlimited refills on sodas & teas but the glass they give you is about the size of a thimble. Also have milkshakes with umpteen different flavors. Its an OK place for a pricey burger. Better then Fatburger...a little bit."}
{"text":"Burgers are decent. Shakes are good. Service is horrible. After a long wait, got only part of the order. Had to ask for our onion rings, which they forgot to make. Got charged for big shakes when we ordered small. Asked for ranch upon ordering, could not get anyone to give us our ranch-our daughter went to the counter to ask and she was ignored by the manager. We then had to go up and ask...and then still waited around. The food was good enough to come back for the most part but the service was so bad that we will not come back to be subjected to that."}
{"text":"Cheeburger Cheeburger..... They totally deserve the additional SE in the name.. This place was nothing short of spectacular.. We had never been there before and after checking out a new Church called the Verve here in Vegas we decided to go snatch some grub and we ended up at cheeburger cheeburger. Pulling into the parking lot was again one of those experiences where you are the only person at the place since it just opened.. Walking in with my daughter and wife the woman at the door just popped up out of the corner with a huge smile and a how are you. After we were seated she asked if we had ever been to cheeburger cheeburger and we said..... well no.. And she proceeded to give us the \" demonstration\"... Okay lets pause for just one second.. What Burger joint have you ever been to that required a Demo prior to consumption... Okay, moving on. After the \"demo\" we started to construct our monstrosities, mine was the delirious which is 3/4lb with bacon, Swiss, tomato, onion-rings, BBQ sauce, Jalapenos and a dash of deliciousness.. The wife scored a Semi serious which is 1/4lb burger with Swiss, pineapple, teriyaki, and avocado.. And we split the best of both which is a combo basket of fries and the most amazing onion rings... The only complaint that I have is that my burger did not come served in a sweet 56 Chevy box like my daughters chicken strips.... I can say that i would sport the box.   If you are ever in the area of blue diamond and rainbow and have a hankering for a delicious, moist and perfectly seasoned burger with any topping you think of this is the place for you.. Well and me for that matter, this is now the go to place for any burger outings."}
{"text":"Some friends and I came here for lunch today. We had 7 people and came in separate cars, and the host didn't want to seat us until we were all there. I know that's standard at some places, but he could have been more gracious about it. When we assured him that they were going to arrive any second now (they were about 2 minutes or so behind us), he gave us an annoyed look before reluctantly seating us.  I got a Semi-serious (7 oz) burger with pineapple and teriyaki sauce. It was pretty good, except that the bun was just too buttery. Don't get me wrong - I love me some butter - but it was just too overpowering. We also got fries and onions rings, which were good. My friends who had milkshakes were raving about them. Unfortunately, I was feeling kind of ill and I didn't want to push my luck with lactose.  Drinks are served in cute little jars, and the place is decorated with a 50's theme. We had to wait about 10 minutes before someone came to take our orders, but our waitress was attentive once she realized she was assigned to our table. She must have realized we were all on our lunch break and anxious to get back to work, so she was pretty quick with getting our check to us.  Cheeburger Cheeburger is overall an alright burger place, but it's a little pricey for an average burger."}
{"text":"Before going to see a movie last night hubby and I set our sites on a restaurant at Tempe Market place.  He really wanted to try the place and I thought why not.  The place wasn't busy but it did seem to take an incredible amount of time to be seated in a dead restaurant, with signs ALL OVER Place telling us to wait to be seated.    Now that we've been seated it's time to look over the huge menu, which is basically your normal burger fare with lots of options.    I ordered a portabello mushroom burger with mozzarella cheese,  sun dried tomatoes, and mayo.  It was Yummy!  We had the Frings basket that was really good with one of their specialty  condiments and I had a cherry soda, made the old fashion way of soda water and cherry flavoring.  It was not worth $2.79.      If you are looking for a lot of choices for your burger this is the place to go.  They have options that even I didn't think of.   Otherwise, there are a lot of better choices at Tempe Market Place."}
{"text":"My husband really wanted to go here and try their shakes, so we came here for dinner last weekend.  Unlike so many other establishments in town, they did not charge for extra stuff  (grind burger, dad's grilled cheese) on the shakes and burgers, which was nice.  We ordered the following: Chocolate Shake with tons of candy in it for the husband Semi Serious - with cheddar, lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion, and guacamole (for me) Serious - with Pepper Jack, Garlic, Bacon (for husband) Best of Both Basket - fries and onion rings for both of us  So while the burger was decent, I didn't think that the meat was flavorful enough to order it again.  My husband felt the same way.  The onion rings had nice batter but it was too salty for me.  I liked the fries, however.  The dipping sauces weren't really worth getting, but my husband liked the cheese.  I felt the horseradish sauce was the best out of the four they offer.  I would have been happy with ketchup or plain.  We thought we might come here again, but with other choices in town with better quality meat, there's really no point.  However my husband absolutely loved the shake and would come here again just for that."}
{"text":"food was amazing!! Burger was delicious, super juicy and flavorful..2 thumbs!! I'll have to try the shakes when I go back. Glad it's close to home :)"}
{"text":"After reading the description I was excited to give this place a try.  I mean the name evokes memories of 70's Saturday Night Live skits, the menu is the ultimate in flexibility regarding toppings and they have over 50 ingredients for their shakes. They have been open at this location for 2 weeks now and there are the usual bugs in the service but nothing major. I ordered a Best of Both (Fries and Rings) and made a portabello, bacon, lettuce jack/cheddar and banana pepper burger).  The menu is truly flexible with tons of free toppings as well as the portabello which costs an additional 1.99.   We also tried the chicken fingers, watermelon tea and watermelon shake.  The onion rings were very good in a tempura type batter instead of the usual breading  The fries were overloaded with pepper and seasoning and neither myself nor my dining companion enjoyed them.  The shake was excellent and I would recommend the shakes to anyone who tries this restaurant.  My daughter enjoyed the chicken fingers and they were actually moist inside.  The burger was serviceable. The best part was the portabello, a nice bun size mushroom fresh and flavorful.  The bacon was crisp and the other ingredients fresh.  I ordered the burger medium and it came just the right pink inside.  Unfortunately, when I broke a piece off to try it without the ingredients, it was flavorless and tough in places,.  With the ingredients it was a good burger, I didn't love the bun but it wasn't bad either.  The burger just doesn't stand alone.  The deserts look great but we were too full so I will update the next time we go.  Overall a good addition to the burger scene and hopefully the burger will improve."}
{"text":"Went with my family to try out cheeburger cheeburger. The only good thing at this place is the hamburger meat itself. We ordered burgers and loaded fries. The burger came but it wasn't the right burger. They got our order wrong and the burger was cold. The loaded fries was ordered twice and it arrived after we finished our burgers. The first order of loaded fries had horseradish on it and we didn't order horseradish. The second order of fries which came after we finished came with the chili on the fries when we ordered it on the side. We also ordered crispy fries and it was not crispy at all. The shakes were okay and we were just wondering to ourselves because there was only two waitresses, would we still be waiting 30 minutes or a hour ? We wanted to try it, and came out unhappy."}
{"text":"Big burger, but my rye was not toasted, tomato missing, and fries were overcooked and greasy.  Slow service too."}
{"text":"This place blows.  Food had no taste and shake was below average for a higher than deserved price.  Johnny Rockets blows this place away and I even prefer a Denny's burger and shake for half the price"}
{"text":"Pas du tout ce à quoi je m'attendais. En entrant le rose et bleu fluo m'ont un peu frappé en plein visage! Je pensais plutôt que c'était pour être un \"snack shack\" mais non, c'est dans l'univers des dinner à la Marilyn et Elvis que je me suis retrouvée. Les repas sont en majorité décidés par vous. On commence par la viande, puis le fromage, les garnitures et les extras. J'aurai aussi aimé choisir mon pain. Puisque je me suis fait ma propre combinaison (classique, fromage de chèvres, piments rouges grillés et onions grillés) j'ai presque l'impression de ne pas pouvoir commenter sur le repas parce que c'est moi qui a tout choisi! Le viande était bonne et cuite juste à point et la grosseur du burger m'a convenue parfaitement. Le service était courtois mais un peu lent et puisqu'il n'y avait que 2 autres couples, et un autre serveur, c'était un peu difficile de comprendre. Je n'étais pas pressée donc ça ne m'a pas trop énervée, mais j'ai quand même remarqué le temps qui s'écoulait avant qu'on viennent prendre notre commande ou donner notre facture. En résumé, beau, bon, oas cher. Parfait pour un repas avant le cinéma!"}
{"text":"Good food and fin 50s music.   Doing the 1 pounder.  Get to have the employees cheer for me and picture on the wall if you finish it.  Game on!"}
{"text":"If the five stars didn't do it, let me just say it... I love Cheeburger Cheeburger!  The burgers are cooked as asked each and every time.  The fries are hot, crispy, and fresh cut.  I don't always have room for desert, but when I do, the waffle sundaes are killer.  I love watching the people around me start smelling the air and pointing as they chatter about what the wonderful smell is.  Since they cook the waffles to order, it always happens.  I can just tell they'll be soon ordering themselves one shortly.  That is if they have room left after eating their huge burgers.  Who in their right mind could find fault in this place?, honestly.  I've been to the Vegas location more than a few times, but even after my first visit they remembered me.  By my third visit, everyone in the place including the cooks greeted me like I'd been a patron for years.  I like that, and in a city with such an ever changing resident population it is so uncommon.  I love the burgers, but I've got to say, the people make each visit a special one."}
{"text":"Keep in mind this review is based on the first time I went to this restaurant 2 summers ago- before I lived in Las Vegas.  I went here for my cousin's ballet recital dinner and ordered the portabello burger.  \"Portabello\" made me think of \"steak\" (that's right, I didn't know what portabello was!) so I ordered it.  When I got my burger, I bit into it and discovered that it was not a steak sammich, but a mushroom. A big mushroom.  I like mushrooms and regularly eat them- so I ate the burger. Something about it was not right though and I stopped 2/3s way through.  Later that night I was having agonizing sharp stomach pains. I was sweating and drifting in and out of sleep.  I continued to feel ill and have additional symptoms throughout the night and into the day.  I started to feel better the next night and was well enough to get out of bed, and even eat at a restaurant in the hotel.   After that experience when returning to Vegas, and eventually moving here, I've time and time again disagreed to going to cheeburger cheeburger due to this incident.  I would not recommend going there- I wouldn't even go back if I was offered free food."}
{"text":"Awesome! Had a late lunch with my boyfriend who downed his brownie batter shake in less than 2 minutes! Alexandria I think was our servers name she was sweet and explained everything. I'm very indecisive so being greeted with a total build your own menu can be overwhelming but still made a delicious wrap and with all the other options I definitely want to go back and try more! Loved the 50s diner theme, super cute lunch spot."}
{"text":"Not the most spectacular burger I have ever had, but not the worst. Not the cheapest burger I have ever had, but not the most expensive, either. It's really your general run-of-the-mill burger joint with a 50's decor. I will say that the sweet potato fries and marshmallow dip are pretty darn tasty though!"}
{"text":"Not sure what Chee stands in Cheeburger. How about S***burger, a big expensive disproportionately large chow called a burger. It is not any cheaper than those on the Strip such as the Burgr. You have to wait forever, pay a whole lot of money for a burger, expensive sides and shakes. Note: Shakes aren't too bad, if watching the calorie chart sin't your thing. I understand this is exactly the place for some folks, some patrons actually love this place. In my opinion the only good thing they have going for them is the 50s diner themed interior.  A-OK... is the best I can muster up for this joint."}
{"text":"This is a chain restaurant, from Florida I believe. But, it's one of the best burger/shake joints around. The onion rings are top notch. When I say top notch, I mean the best anywhere I've been. The coating is light and crispy, not too much, just enough and done right, almost sweet. The fries are solid, and the burgers are very good with almost unlimited options. The shakes are plentiful and varied. I've been there dozens of times, and even though I've moved away, I still go back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Wow, put me in the minority because I was not very impressed by this place. I've heard alot about this place and alot of people have been touting this place as the best burger spot hands down in Vegas. Well I don't even know if I would pick this place over Carl's Jr., or McDonald's. The decor is 50s dinerish which I understand the theme they're going for but the food, eh not so much. The burgers ...are okay, the fries...tasted like basic potatoes, service was cool, she was nice. I would say the only thing that was good was their selection of milkshakes but I am not really a fan of sweets so can't say much about that. Maybe this place would've been better if people didn't hype it up but regardless I would've rather gone up the 215 to Kilroy's or even Fuddruckers for a better burger."}
{"text":"Asian review:  Service was retarded. The service sucked, who cares they brought me my food. I never base a review on service, it's all about the food.   Where can I get super full off a burger meal? The 1lb burger was easy to put down, still hungry. No worries add a shake and a basket of fries then it's magic. I eat a lot. I never get full. I did today.   Next time I'm gonna do the 2lb burger. Girls won't like this place. Especially if they don't cook and don't know what ingredients they like. You have to be crafty and know how to put your food together. It's all customize-able.   If you eat like Joey Tribbiani from Friends this place is great. The only thing that makes this place worth going back is the 2lb burger. After that I don't know what's left Chee Burger Chee Burger. Do a super Spicy Challenge too."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place to dine. The fries are so-so. Pretty overpriced for what you get as well. There are lots of other places where the food and service are better."}
{"text":"Foodies beware: if you want to avoid bad service, avoid this location. Cheeburger is a good brand but this location fell short of what cheeburger cheeburger should be. Our most recent visit we had to send the food back three times.. The waitress took 15 minutes to greet us meanwhile she was playing with her hair and not washing her hands. Took more than an hour to get our food.. And it wasn't even close to being right. After all the trys I gave them I finally gave up on this location. I really do hope they get their act together for the business.. If they want a good waitress I could do a better job then the kids they have working there. ( with no experience)"}
{"text":"I come here from time to time for lunch with my boyfriend. Previously reviewed by Bryan M. The burgers are okay. Not a huge fan of burgers in general. The chocolate cherry shake is amazing if it's made thick and right.(not with whole cherries.. It's dangerous). I would like to try the sweet potato fries but haven't yet. Onion rings are very good. I really wish they had iceberg lettuce that's not shredded... Absolutely hate shredded lettuce. And it makes the burger fall apart. It's alittle pricey, not price friendly to go here on a regular basis. But everyone should at least try this place. Recommended.    The staff is great. Very friendly and always helpful."}
{"text":"Fries and shakes are the only this I liked about this place. Both my husbands and my burgers were dry and seriously lacking flavor. Service was terrible as well."}
{"text":"The burger - not bad, after I had to send it back realizing 2 bites in that they gave me the wrong one. Thankfully it was a long layover. The service - slow. The attitude - horrible. These people did not greet anybody or crack a smile the whole time I was there. They made me feel (especially after I had to take my burger back) that I was an interruption to their time. It was just an overall yucky feeling. Customer service training might help."}
{"text":"First timer and definitely won't be my last time! I've seen this place in the southwest part of town and I've always wanted to try it and today was that day! For the amount of food they give you the price wasn't bad at all! I was easily impressed. I've been craving a damn good turkey burger and this place surely didn't let me down! I'm loving the 50s diner feel too! Service was outstanding! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The last time I tried this place was in Lone Tree, CO about 10 years ago. I didn't think it was great there, and it wasn't great in Vegas, either. I'm not sure what all the hype is about, and I'm not sure how they've been voted best burger in 29 cities-- unless Vegas and Lone Tree were not included in that.   The service is SLOW. Granted it was a Friday night, but there seemed to be plenty of people working there and yet it was impossible to get a drink refill. I ordered a milk shake- definitely the hi-light of the meal- but it came so far ahead of the meal I was almost done with it and felt sick before food even reached me.   The food... I've had better at so many other places. I ordered a build-your-own chicken sandwich with BBQ sauce, cheese and bacon. The chicken was tough and over cooked, the bun cold and hard, not enough sauce and the skimpy 2 pieces of bacon were over done. I had about 3 bites before my jaw gave out.   The fries? Undercooked and cold. COLD. WTF? It's a busy Friday night and you bring me a basket of cold fries with my already sucky sandwich? Ugh.   We ordered the grilled cheese for the baby. I didn't think you could F that up, but apparently you can... by bringing it out without the cheese melted. WHAT? How can the bread be warm but the cheese still stiff? Needless to say he didn't eat it. What a waste.   My husband got a burger that was uneventful. He said he's had better, but did manage to finish it. He's the only one that actually ate.   I would not recommend this place or go back. There are so many other better places in Vegas for a burger that wasting your money on this crap would be stupid."}
{"text":"This place has a pretty cool topping selection, but it does not hide the fact that the patty has no taste. I really love a patty that has some seasoning!!!  I also tried the onion rings and french fries. They were good, but I have had better. I also tried three of their signature sauces:   - Creamy Cheese - It needed salt. - Texas Horseradish - I usually do not eat horseradish, but I tasted it anyways and came to the conclusion that I still do not like horseradish. - Creamy Jalapeno - Bland.  It sucks that you have to pay for the sauces. I found myself dipping my fries and rings in ranch, which was free anyways.  Cheeburger Cheeburger has a couple of things going for them. The shake and malt selection is awesome. The 50's diner theme is pretty cool. Also, the contest for eating their 20 oz. burger is entertaining. Lastly, you could \"Invent Your Own\" anything here - cheeseburger, chicken sandwich, grilled cheese, salad, soda, iced tea, lemonade, shake or malt.  I doubt I will be back, but if I do, I will not be coming back for a cheeseburger, but for a Cinnamon Bun Shake!!!"}
{"text":"Just left there and Omy it was delicious! My son did the 1# challenge and he did well! The serious burger was serious!"}
{"text":"Have become quite regulars now so review is due. Always good tasting fresh burgers with friendly staff. Onion rings are amazing the regular fries not so much wasn't a fan. You can get lunch special for 7 bucks not bad worth the price. Minus one star for my girlfriends milk shake (chocolate cherry) being made with whole cherries with the stem still on all of them. Almost choked during  the car ride home called and informed manager who promised it would be taken care of and did take care of us well the next time we came in. Overall recommended"}
{"text":"Finally tried this location out. We are frequent visitors on the rainbow location and the staff treats us like family there and calls us regulars. But was on this side of town and had the craving for it so settled on trying this location. Previously I had heard very negative things about this location so I was a bit nervous but it turned out to be pretty good for the most part. Burger was juicy and fresh. Onion rings were good but seemed to have much more breading on them compared to the ones I normally have but nothing major. Service was quick for the most part. Why not four or five stars then? Because I think it's bad business to advertise lunch and dinner specials at one of your locations ( rainbow) but have no specials of any kind at your other location when your wanting customers familiar with the brand to visit both your locations. So to close I would say stick to rainbow location of you can but its not bad at this one either."}
{"text":"It was good, service was great, bit prices are too high for what you get. $50 for two adults and two children to eat burgers and fries seems a bit steep. Will go back, but not often at that price point."}
{"text":"Clever, cheap and delicious.  Whether you are in the mood for a shake or malt..... Or just there to customize a burger this place is so yummy! I've gone quite a few times and probably would go more but the location is desolate and far from home! I've gravitated to the grilled cheese where I customize with veggies to my hearts desire.  The burgers are great and meat really good, but I feel like the meat sometimes gets in the way of my inner child who wants to throw a hairy combinations of toppings with cheese between a bun and EAT! :) Fries and onions rings are supurb! From the outside looks like a bar and pub - from the inside looks like the diner from back to the future with all the neon lights!"}
{"text":"My favorite burger place near my home. Working my way up to the crazy huge burger challenge. And yes the onion rings are the best ever!"}
{"text":"Had a really great experience with my family the other night for dinner. Love the \"build your own\" concept. Love that there are alternatives to beef, my daughter loved the salmon patty!"}
{"text":"Just stopped by with a family of 15 people and the ppl here was not welcoming at all!!!! They looked at us as we walked in and was absolutely not happy at all. Would have made them a a few hundred bucks with this party. I feel bad for the owner as I hope they are not struggling for business. But Lori which I believe her name was, had this face of not wanting to help us get dinner. Good luck with going in right before they close. They look like they are constipated when you arrive in a big group right before they close on Saturday. But tell me, Who closes at 9pm especially on Saturday?..."}
{"text":"Trying this joint for the first time love the friendly atmosphere so many choices I am almost overwhelmed but I did the semi serious burger couldn't do anything larger will let you all know how it goes when I am done devouring my burger lol"}
{"text":"Really? I've never written a review for this place? Well, here we go I guess.  I've been here on a number of occasions. My most recent trip was with my recently purchased Groupon. The diner atmosphere is fun, the wait staff is super friendly and welcoming. They make you feel right at home. They play all the great oldies, it really puts you in the mood.  The burgers are great, you get to specify what size (up to a 1-pounder) you'd like and then there's a topping free-for-all. There is an extensive list of toppings that you can have added to your burger, which is my faovrite thing about this place. I usually order mine with swiss cheese, teriyaki, artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, extra jalapeno, tomato and lettuce. Sides don't come with the burger, so me and my fella ordered a medium onion rings to share. They're enormous, so err on the side of caution when ordering. They also have a variety of dipping, if you'd like. Their menu is large and they have plenty of non-beef burger options as well as sandwiches, wraps and platters. You'll definitely find something for almost everyone here.  If you order the pounder and are able to eat the whole thing you get your picture taken with a giant stuffed burger and you are forever remembered in their photo album hall of fame, which is fun. I usually just order the \"serious\" which is a third pounder. Might be a great idea to share a larger burger if you can agree on the toppings.   They have an extensive list of milkshakes to choose from. Every flavor you can think of and you can combine as you like. Definitely worth a spin if you haven't tried it before.   Great nice little diner. Plenty of coupons are available, so keep a look out for them (I never set foot in this place without a coupon) and take a trip. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"I am a PICKY eater.  I don't like lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, or mustard on my burgers.  That's kind of standard fare.  Whenever I go to a restaurant and order a burger, I hang my head in shame as I politely request no veggies, just the ketchup or mayo.  This makes for a usually boring and unimaginative burger.  Imagine my delight when I find out that Cheeburger actually wants ME to pick whatever I WANT to top my burger!  They won't look at me funny when I ask for things like black olives on my burger.  They don't question my desire to top my burger with a pineapple and have it covered in ranch dressing.  This is a place for people like me.  It's nice to not be questioned or judged based on your burger preferences.  As far as the quality of food goes, I have never been dissatisfied here.  They always cook it exactly the way I like it or really close to it.  The meat is always fresh tasting and juicy.  The ingredients they top it with are also fresh and plentiful, no one likes a cheapskate.  The fries here are pretty good, and the seasoning they have is not as good as say, Red Robin's, but it is it's own unique salt/pepper/garlic blend that my tastebuds enjoy.  I have had the onion rings before and they are pretty decent, just a little thick for my taste.  The soda options here are fun, and again they never question when you want a kiwi diet coke.    The decor in here is ugly as sin, but you can sit outside like we usually do and avoid the ugly decor.  If you are in the mood to be creative and surprise your palate, this is the place for you.  If you hate to be judged on your pickiness of food, then you will be right at home here.  Also, the added bonus is that it is a FANTASTIC place for people watching."}
