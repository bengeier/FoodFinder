{"text":"The service was awful here. We had a party of 10 and couldn't even provide us with enough menus. We had 2 to share amongst the whole group. The food took an extremely long time to come and was nothing spectacular. The risotto was very watery and the steaks were very dry and bland. This place is too expensive for the quality of food they provide. Would much rather go to the Keg for a decent steak."}
{"text":"Great food and service here! We thoroughly enjoyed the wine, starters and entrees that we ordered!   The meal started with freshly baked dinner rolls in a cast iron pan paired with black truffle butter, roasted garlic and olives. The bread had a nice crisp to the outside and warm cottony dough on the inside.   For starters, we ordered the smoked octopus, fried calamari and crab cakes. If you are looking for something more substantial, the calamari is the way to go! The dish itself and each ring of calamari was huge and perfectly fried! The crab cakes were the perfect texture, and the octopus was unique and served on a hash brown like piece! Let's just say that with our wine and starters, we were quite satisfied already!   We appreciated that our servers constantly checked on our progress, never rushing us to finish. They timed the serving of our dishes perfectly, and always asked before they took our dishes and cutlery away.   For entrees, we ordered the xxi chophouse select cut steak, lamb, Cornish hen and ny strip loin. All of which were cooked to perfection (medium rare as requested). The seasonings were flavourful and supplemented the flavour and texture of the meat perfectly. The portions were also much larger than we expected, and were served with potatoes and vegetables. We definitely left beyond satisfied!   The only issue reason why I gave them a 4/5 instead of a 5/5 is because they did not come to fill our water glasses as frequently as we would have liked and the restrooms are shared with the doctors house (outside of the restaurant and upstairs in the venue). But all in all a good experience!   I would definitely recommend coming here for their steaks, although you need to be willing to pay for the quality!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner experience last week with them! Our friends were impressed with their steaks so we decided to go check it out. It took us around 30 min from downtown To to get there. We didn't make a reservation, but they gave us one of the best tables available on Friday night. Menu has a nice variety of meets, fish, salads, desserts. We ordered two dry aged steaks which were amazing! The meat was so tender and medium rare was cooked to perfection! As well, cocktails were well done! This is a MUST spot to visit for all meat lovers!"}
{"text":"This was my first time there today. We chose the restaurant as there were few gluten and lactose free options in town. I ordered the arugula salad and opted for shrimp to be added at an extra cost of $9. Woohoo I got one shrimp for the splurge. It also had a half pear. Not recommended."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner for Valentine's Day. I had the 14oz striploin and it was better than any steak I've had downtown. The ambience was great, the place just has a great vibe. This place is a gem, we will definitely be going back again in the future, it will become one of our regular spots for sure."}
{"text":"This is place is average at best. They have tried to have an upscale look but the devil is in the details. The entrance and washroom is shared with the doctors house. The stake looked promising as it is dry aged and on display but even that was just average not very flavourful. Service is just OK. Tried Chop a few days later and it was way better which is dad because Chop is a chain."}
