{"text":"Uncle Louie's Rest is great. A lot of locals go their on a regular bases. The Steamed Clams are to die for, and the Veal dishes are wonderful. Uncle Louie visits the tables as the owner and takes a real interest in the customer. Great Italian Food, and great prices on wine."}
{"text":"My fathers favorite Italian place and very popular with others in the neighborhood, particularly popular with those 70 and over.  The food is conistently bland and the management confused.  My visit last night was typical - we were seated and given menus.  10 minutes later the table next to us was seated.  5 minutes after that they had their orders taken.  We were still holding menus.  After 25 min. the table next to us was enjoying their salads and we were still reading menus.  When I asked the owner (Mrs. Louie) to remind our waitress that we were there she snapped and told me that the error was \"not deliberate\".  Yeah, I understand it was an accident but a simple \"I'm sorry, I'll take care of it\" would have been great.  Her taking our order would have been even better.    The food is just plain OK.  My wife ordered pasta that is difficult to mess up.  I ordered Veal Parm. for the 2nd time.  It was no better than the first time I've tried it.  There are some really good Italian places nearby, if you are not seeking bland, boring and poor service look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian restaurant run by a beautiful sweet family!  Try the eggplant Parmesan-top menu choice!  Veal Marsala, another great choice, tender and fantastic!"}
{"text":"Yummy  loved not too much crust, sauce or cheese  Kiddos love the pasta & meatballs almost like grandmas meatballs.  Bar & eating area  - happy hour specials nice"}
{"text":"I am a fan of this place. We really like veal and Uncle Louie's does a great job and it always on the menu. Very friendly place, very local and still busy even on off season.. Food is all great.  We like the casual atmosphere ."}
{"text":"The ambience is where this place puts its money. Unfortunately not the kitchen. Eggplant parm was fried in old oil and had a rancid taste. Caeser salad drenched in heavy dressing masking how old the lettuce was. We are from NY so we know good Italian. This place isn't anything like a home cooking, neighborhood trattoria it pretends to be."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza and convenient for those living in Terravita.  Retro menu with emphasis on Italian food from the early 90s.  Friendly service makes this a neighborhood favorite.  Downside is that it's a touch on the pricey side --- at $17 each the pizza here is more expensive than at LGO"}
{"text":"Great Italian food. Always delicious! Always great friendly service. Usually pretty busy, so make a reservation if you think of it, just to be sure"}
{"text":"Not worth the drive.  Nice service but the food is over priced. Air conditioning not working properly, and it was WARM!"}
{"text":"A \"neighborhood\" restaurant in the truest sense. It's friendly atmosphere and high quality food make it a casual evening winner.  The menu offers a great selection of Italian specials that do not disappoint. Taken altogether it's a place I have on my regular return list."}
{"text":"We appreciate great Italian food and love this out of the way place.  The food and service was top rate. The portions were generous."}
{"text":"Went there once and the food was ok. Husband thought it was terrible and swore he wouldn't go again. I convinced him to try it on another occasion. He agreed. We sat outside and it was cold so they put the heater on for us, and we were happy.  Soon a table of 6 arrived who were a bit older than us (& must've appeared to have fatter pockets) because the owner's wife hurried over, took our heater and brought it to the new table. The new table was embarrassed because they hadn't mentioned they were cold and it was obvious that I was cozied up to the heater. They kinda made faces as if to say,  \"We're sorry,\" shrugging their shoulders, etc. No one said anything; it was just one of those things that was astoundingly awkward to everyone watching. Soon after, they were sweating and taking off their jackets. After all, they'd never asked for a heater. I wouldn't have been surprised if the woman had taken the bread off of our table next, the way she was spastically arranging for this potentially lucrative table.  We never reclaimed our heater, we just finished up and got outta there, our decision never to return final."}
{"text":"The new location for UL is pretty well tucked away at the end of the new AJ's Shopping center but it is well worth finding.  Sounds like there were some issues they had to get over when they first opened but my experience was great!  Went for an early dinner at about 6 pm.  The service was prompt and our server was very friendly.  We ordered a Mediterranean pizza and Penne with Wild Mushrooms in Cream Sauce.  The Penne was amazing.  A wonderful mixture of different mushrooms in a delicate cream sauce over perfectly al dente penne.   I'm sure it's a million calories but I could easily have snarfed down another serving!  The pizza combination of artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, feta, banana pepper rings, etc was great.  The only reason I knocked a star off is the middle third of the pizza could have been crispier.  Of course that can be difficult with that many wet ingredients.  One side note for all you ladies with a fireman fetish.  There is a new fire station across the parking lot and the bar area was filled with at least a half dozen firemen.  So, if that's your cup of tea, then you might find someone to help put out your blazing inferno!"}
{"text":"Ordered one blue bomber pizza and two pasta dishes for take out.  Bill was $62.  They said it would be 20 minutes, so I showed up in 25 minutes.  My pizza was already setting on the counter, but I waited over 20 more minutes for my two pastas.  We had to reheat all food when I got home.  There were 11 people waiting to give there names for a table, but nobody was at the desk the entire time I was there.  There are better Italian restaurants, less expensive, with better service."}
{"text":"Poor service.  Waited an hour for food.  Server told us it was because we didn't order appetizers...hmmm.  Overpriced. For a restaurant in my neighborhood that I have eaten at for years this was my last meal there. Love the vodka sauce but too many other restaurants that appreciate my business."}
{"text":"Used to go to the old location when it was new way, way back.  Finally tried the \"new\" location a few weeks ago with the family.  Everyone loved it.  Not sure if we'd come back for date night but definitely a place to bring the family.  Fresh food and something for everyone.  Louie stopped by to welcome us and thought it was a nice touch to make sure everyone was enjoying their meals.  My daughter ordered spaghetti & meatballs.  I can't believe how much she ate.  I don't usually order this at restaurants but tried a bite of hers and might try it next time.    My son had the fettuccine alfredo and it was delicious!  I ordered the sea bass & vegetables.  I could have shared it with the entire table.  It was so big.  Really good.  The hubs enjoyed the veal piccatta.  We shared Spumoni and the Tiramisu.  Not usually a fan of Tiramisu but it was light and creamy."}
{"text":"I always go to uncle Louie's. Always consistent always excellent. The calamari is delicious. As wonderful a glass of Pinot."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Scottsdale! Kept it simple with just cheese and pepperoni, perfect ratio of cheese, sauce and pepperoni. The thin crust has just the right amount of chew with just a little crispy. The white bean soup and their salads are also amazing."}
{"text":"There are lots of better places than Uncle Louie The Restaurant. The Mediterranean Pizza was good. The salad with chicken was tasteless and the chicken was dry and the lettuce was just iceberg lettuce. The veal Parmesan was burnt. The waiter forgot to place one of our orders. All in all, not a good experience. I apologize for giving such a negative review. It's obviously a family run business which I generally try to support rather than chain restaurants. However, they need to get their act together and improve on the food preparation."}
{"text":"My wife and I stumbled on to uncle Louie's while staying at a near bye resort, we had the eggplant parmigiana, it was Absolutly wonderful, we now live in Scottsdale and frequent uncle Louie's, Louis and Marie are genuine people and make you feel welcome, we'll be seeing you there, peace, John"}
{"text":"Ok, so I will say they got us a table without a reservation, but I think they burned the crap out of the calimari in retaliation....  The pizza was ok, not quite like something out of a box at home, but not as good as costco pizza even!  If it haddn't been for a couple of great martini's this would have gotten a much lower rating....Good luck"}
{"text":"Average food combined with really poor service.  Owner's wife seated us, and sat across from our table conversing with friends.  Ten minutes later, not even a glass of water while she was sitting directly across from us the entire time.  Hope she enjoyed her chat.  Epitome of arrogance."}
{"text":"Uncle Louie is the kindest man and has the best family!!! The food is amazing!!! Pizza great, Pasta great just like home!! Dessert is great!!! So worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Uncle Louie's is the classic local bar and eatery. The restaurant services up excellent and pasta and pizza dishes and pours a strong drink. We usually sit at the bar and enjoy the game and always happy to see Louie and Marie.  For Phoenix the Italian food is great and you won't be disappointed. My wife sticks with the pasts which she loves and I usually go for the pizza. You won't be disappointed. The staff is young and the restaurant is new so that may be some of reasons for peoples comments on the service, but these are areas that will be worked out in time. Don't let it stop you from coming.  Its in North Scottsdale (I do mean North) so things die down at 9pm. if you coming oast that call and make sure their open."}
{"text":"It's interesting how a neighborhood family own restaurant can succeed, specially being in the top of the hoods. I guess good food, nice decor and great service builds regulars.   I had the uncle Louie salad which was good, nice serving and with a lot of flavor.   The penne wild mushroom was super good.  A nice touch is that the owners (I assume they were the owners) talked to us a couple of times. Not the typical annoying manager/owner who engages into an endless conversation but a gentle genuine courtesy chat.  All in all a very nice place."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, particularly the fennel sausage.  Items other than pizza do less well, but highly recommend the pizza"}
{"text":"Great food, great wine and awesome atmosphere!!!! Great service and fresh food. Louie sat and visited with us like we were family."}
{"text":"Local Pizza place needs a little work. Date night with Susan at Uncle Louie pizza. Food was great but a little pricy. We had the steamed clams at $14.00, halibut @$25.00 and $14.00 margarita pizza and a slice of Tiramisu @$7.00, plus wine. Very awkward situation with the wine.  First off they have 25% off all bottles going on. GOOD.  We odered the Baby Speri Amarone at $52.00. The waitress brought the wine to the table and poured it. It was very dry. Dryer than any Amarone I ever had. BAD.  Curious I looked at the bottle and it was a Masi Campofiorin. I retrieved a menu and it was listed for $39.00. I told the waitress she pulled the wrong bottle. She looked puzzled and took it back to the bar. She came back and stated the bar tender said it is a Amarone . \"It even says it's a Amarone in the computer at $52.00\". VERY VERY BAD. I asked her to look at the bottle and tell me where does it say Speri Amarone anywhere on the bottle? It took a bit of coaxing to get her to realize the bottle, the menu and the computer are not aligned. I had her look at the menu listing it at $39.00. She went and got Marie the owner and they agreed to lower the price to $39.00 or pull the Armarone we wanted in the first place. (That was very nice of them) I said will just keep it because dinner was already in front of us. It made dinner a little uncomfortable and people were looking at us.  So, we got home and looked at the bill, Remember the 25% off all bottles? Never happened. Never took 25% off the $39.00. BTW you can get the Masi Campofiorin at total wine for $10.00.  All in all the food was great, but they need to get organized, sync up the menu and computer with the wine and realize they have a problem without all the Drama. The waitress said she doesn't know wine very well, but she could at least read what she's serving.. LikeLike ·  · Share"}
{"text":"Right off the bat I was extremely unimpressed with the casual atmosphere of this place.  I don't know why I assumed it was more of a classy vibe, but Yelpers, feel free to go in your yoga and car wash best.  For the prices of this place, I expected I \"nicer\" atmosphere.   Now the food:  We had calamari to start and it was WAY over breaded and the sauce was ALL horseradish.  I couldn't even eat it.  The pesto dish was more like a butter dish with SOME basil pesto... it was literally drowning in sauce.  I have high expectations on Italian food and I just don't think the food and atmosphere match the prices.  Service was below average - just a bunch of kids not knowing anything about the menu."}
{"text":"I live in Parker, Co and I have to eat at Uncle Louie's every time I visit my mom here on the \"Carefree\" side of Scottsdale. I can't get past the spaghetti and meatballs and/or minestrone soup. They use fresh tomatoes only, the sauce is amazing! Marie and Louis are always here and make us feel like family!"}
{"text":"When were in town we always  have a meal or two here. Great food and friendly servers! A must when your in town."}
{"text":"Decided to order a pizza from Uncle Louie since it's pretty close to my house and I am always looking for new places. I ordered an extra large pepperoni pizza for 21$ (which is extremely pricey) and went in to pick it up. What I got was barely a large, about 15 inches. It was overly oily, to the point where I had to use a paper towel to suck up the grease on top first before trying to eat it. It was overly salty yet somehow had no taste and the crust was soggy. I wasn't sure if I was looking at a regular pizza or a thin crust, it's like they couldn't make their mind up when they made it. I have eaten better pizza from a circle K. I was very disappointed in not only the price and the size but the taste and quality as well. Will not be going inside to try anything else they make."}
{"text":"Louie and Marie are great hosts and son (chef) and really skilled guy! The fresh halibut with a light tomato sauce underneath and yummy breadcrumbs on top with a great variety of veggies was beyond compare! Better than the best Seattle restaurant. Yum!! On top of that it was the Chef's birthday, a warm pleasant night with the two of us able to eat on the patio."}
{"text":"Great food great vibes an all around good time. I had the salmon picata, they killed it. The staff was friendly, Sheree was an awesome server!"}
{"text":"There are not many options in N Scottsdale, so you really do hope the restaurants do well (and stick around) up here...friendly staff and decent food....but, the pasta portions are ridiculously small while being very pricey! The beer selection is minimal...no IPA on draft..and, a tiny bar space...the outdoor area is cozy with the fireplace and heat lamps when there is a chill in the air...but, re-think the $$$ ratio to portion of food....kinda a rip-off."}
{"text":"Just meh. Service was friendly, but the food was well, fine. Just fine. Not bad, but nothing especially good either. Nothing to justify the prices, so we won't be back."}
{"text":"Very Friendly Staff, over priced, poorly prepared italian food. Bottom line is that it is simply not worth the effort. My meal was so bad that I sent it back and left."}
{"text":"Timid chef, bland sauce, way over-priced. Lasagna pasta actually  overpowered the sauce. Rigatoni sauce was underwhelming. Brad was good. Each entre is roughly 50 - 100% more than the  price at other, better places."}
{"text":"This was an overall great dining experience while I was on vacation in AZ. I had a wonderful 5-star Italian dinner. Great food, wonderful atmosphere, and superb staff. I realized I left my credit card there by accident and I called them right away, they were extremely helpful and, after verifying that the card was mine, they mailed me my card the next day. Will definitely make a point to go back here every time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious food, fabulous drinks, and wonderful customer service. I highly recommend eating here. The staff is welcoming, and if you're lucky you'll run into Uncle Louie! I have loved every dish I have tried here, and have never heard a customer complain! Thank you for the amazing food, I visit whenever I get a chance!"}
{"text":"This is a great place I can get a quick sit down bite at when heading back from Heard Museum North Scottsdale, with locations just north and south of \"HMNS.\"  I'm a fan of the salad and the UL pizza. Its not bianco but its good midwest italian."}
{"text":"I heard of this place and it is very good.  I really my fish sea bass special.  The salads are great.  I will come back and try again.  My husband had the pasta.  Yum!  The host was so gracious and we didn't wait long at all.  I would recommend this place if your up in the n. Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, best pizza in town. Louie and Marie make you feel very welcome. The staff are friendly, fun and effiecient ."}
{"text":"Several customers of our had recommended Uncle Louie's so on our way home from Flagstaff we decided to place a togo order. Nice atmosphere and very clean. An older couple (seemed to be the owners) were warmly greeting customers and the place was full on Monday evening.  My wife had a pasta and I had a pizza. Both were great. When we have more time we will be back to enjoy the restaurant and try additional dishes."}
{"text":"The service was great, I didn't like the five dollar coronas. But the food was awesome as well!"}
{"text":"Made reservations for 7:30pm for a party of 9. Walked in and they did not have our table ready and was shocked to see that someone actually booked a reservation of 9. Not a good way to start the evening with friends. 30 minutes passed our reservation they put together two tables in such a tight area it was impossible to enjoy the food, it was TIGHT.  Food was super expensive for the portions they give you. Caesar salad, I've had better. Ordered the Penne Vodka and had them add shrimp, it was really good but again, for the price, felt like we didn't get enough pasta.  Server did not check-in on us enough, had to get up for more forks, had to ask for serving spoons, napkins, etc.  Happy we stopped by to break bread with friends but we will not be back due to the price and the portions and lack of customer service."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for great Italian food and this place nails it to a T! No matter how great food can be the service makes or breaks it in my opinion and I couldn't have been more pleased with our adorable server Cherie! 5 stars from me:)"}
{"text":"I want to love and support this place so badly. The entire staff are all so sweet, friendly and attentive.  The bread and salad are so delicious, but the serving sizes of the entrees are so small. When my pasta first came, I was wondering where the rest of it went.  I was starving and hoping to have a nice filling meal. Not filling up on a pasta dish is practically unheard of. I hope they will work on their portions so we can go back for a nice, filling dinner."}
{"text":"Came on a recommendation...the clamp luginini  was  very tasty, but the vibe in the restaurant was so welcoming..the bread was yummy..and now finishing off with the an expresso and Taramisu...I definitely will be back and recommend it."}
{"text":"This is a one of a kind! The owners will greet you and welcome you. It feels like your having dinner with your family. The food is delicious!! The wine was amazing!! I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Just had the Rigatoni Bolognese which was the only thing I had yet to try in the 6 yrs I've been coming to this fabulous neighborhood restaurant. The Pizza and Pasta dishes are to die for. The chalkboard specials are always worth a peek. My wife's favorite pizza is the Brooklyn Bridge with meatballs and roasted peppers. The service is always friendly and the make a mean Manhattan at the bar. Louie and Marie welcome all their guests like family. Don't hesitate to make this a regular stop in North Scottsdale/Carefree/Cavecreek area."}
{"text":"Many restaurants in the Phoenix area are in strip malls. Uncle Louie is in a nice one - but one just the same. The decor looked it too. It's a good thing that the place was busy and the host was warm and gracious - as if you were an old friend. (I think Louie's wife?) Service was good and prompt. I read that others haven't been so lucky but maybe it's because I was with regulars. The Caprese salad was very good and had razor thin slices of prosciutto on it. Yum. Between the 3 of us, we had the Veal Picatta, Shrimp Scampi and Pizza - all were delicious. The shrimps were a good size and perfectly cooked. My friend didn't share her pasta but I assume it was tasty. The veal was fresh and tasty! Big portion and lots of capers. I have to say that I did not try the pizza ... until the next morning cold. It was still amazing and I am kicking myself for not eating it fresh! Overall - the food was fresh and true - meaning I didn't get lots of food that tasted processed like a big chain might have. They are pretty pricey but in that area, it's not a problem. I can tell you one thing - If I lived close by - I would go pretty often. I live in an area of chain restaurants and getting something family owned that isn't a diner is hard to come by. Next time I travel to Phoenix, I will try Uncle Louies and get the pizza!"}
{"text":"We went to the recently opened new location, which didn't have the sandwiches but I guess had more pastas? We had the rush street (pepperoni) pizza and the one with sausage for appetizers. I had the lobster ravioli which was really good. Everyone else enjoyed their food, all got a variety of dishes.   The downside was it was newly opened, they didn't get our reservation call from this location (we went to this location and they called the new location for us and put us on the list and the hostess was not at all nice about this) and so we waited *forever* (a good 45min) in a packed place that had no sitting area (the bar of course was full). Also we sat between the kitchen and the waitstaff area so I got to listen to the complaints and drama of the waitstaff. I get places are new, but try to *look* professional even if you can't do your job."}
{"text":"DH has been wanting to eat at Uncle Louie's for ages and we finally got there.  We may always be there!  Hands down, we think this was probably the best Italian food either of us have had since we were in Priaiano on the Amalfi Coast and we became addicted to a family-owned restaurant called La Strada.  It's not a big place, but the booths and tables are set comfortably spaced and the ambiance is warm and cozy.  DH and I had to wait about 20 minutes for a table at 7 pm on Saturday night----the dining room and bar were full of happy eaters!  The smells were out of this world and we just got hungrier!  We got seated and within moments, Uncle Louie himself came to take our drinks order since the servers were super busy.  I chose an Angeline Pinot Noir and DH took the Leese-Fitch Adobe Merlot.  I am a fan of Angeline and there's always a few bottles in the rack at home, so it was what I expected, but DH said his merlot was very good.  Again, only a couple of minutes passed before we had our healthy pours and we took a look at the menu.  A lot of lovely offerings without being overwhelming.  I decided to start with the Lobster Bisque (not the most Eye-talian choice, but it was cold and a hearty bisque sounded good) and DH selected the Uncle Louie's house salad.  Italian or not, the Lobster Bisque, as our server said when I ordered it, was off the grid delicious.  Creamy and rich with a hint of sherry and FULL of chunks of succulent lobster.  I could hardly eat it fast enough!  My only caveat was that it could have been hotter.  It wasn't cold or even cool, but how incredible it would have been warmed a few more degrees.  DH said his salad tasted \"just picked\" and the light balsamic vinaigrette was delicious.  For my entree, I had the veal picatta and DH went for the chicken saltimbocca.  We had the choice of pasta or a medley of fresh sauteed veggies---we both had the pasta.  Well, there is a reason the veal picatta is the house specialty.  It left me speechless---probably because I was stuffing my mouth!  The quantity of perfectly cooked veal scallops was generous---I really shouldn't have been able to eat it all along with the mound of pasta, all deliciously soaking up this lemon and caper and wine sauce---oh, my!  Yet, I did.  And DH had absolutely no problem scraping his plate clean of his chicken saltimbocca, he said it was perfectly executed, without the over-reaching saltiness you often get with the prosciutto-wrapped chicken, and the chicken itself was so tender and moist.  Oh---I can't forget---my veal picatta was accompanied by two crusty wedges of buttery toasted bread and the most wonderful bruschetta...  It was juicy and garlic-y and all the things you want from a bruschetta.  Our server suggested the tiramisu to finish, but really---we couldn't.  We were ROTUND, at this point.  Which was sad, because everything was so good, we just wanted to eat more!  As I said, ambiance was comfortable, Uncle Louie and Marie and our server made us feel welcome and cared for.  We can't wait to go back.  The only reason I didn't give five stars is: 1) I SELDOM give five stars---I mean, that's the ultimate, right?; and 2) the lobster bisque and our entrees themselves could all have been a little hotter.  I know it was pretty cold for an Arizona night, but even so.  A pity they don't have the facilities to warm their plates, that might have helped.  But really---I have often mentioned that Italian food is not my very favorite cuisine, but I tell you---Uncle Louie's could change my mind.  Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I have always been obsessed with uncle Louie's! Their Italian food is so delicious and we have been coming here for years! They make one of the best antipasto salads I've ever had."}
{"text":"I dined on lobster ravioli, chicken Parmesan, spaghetti and Cesar salad, this restaurant is a family owned and operated gem! The food is delicious , the service is exceptional and the prices reasonable, the next time I visit Arizona I will return to this eatery!!"}
{"text":"This is my home away from home! Always very good food, Chef Michael is family owner. Pasta is yummy , salads good and his Lobste Bisque outrageous, ( only special occasions)"}
{"text":"Amazing drinks by the bartender Alex and found was super tasty !!  Can't wait to return perfect happy hour!"}
{"text":"When I suggested that we go to Uncle Louie's for dinner tonight, I forgot that the new location was open... I was starving, so I was excited that we didn't have to drive an extra couple of miles to get to the original.  We were greeted by Louie and Marie themselves, and the restaurant was hopping around 8:30pm on Saturday night.  Angela was our server - she was super friendly.  The three of us shared 2 Greek salads, a pasta dish, and an eggplant parmesan.  It was plenty of food, and really hit the spot.  Only three stars this time, since service was on the slower side, and perhaps the young kids working could use a bit more training.  I'm sure I'll return and hopefully in time, I'll update with that extra star.  Thanks Uncle Louie for filling our bellies yet again!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for mediocre pasta dishes and minestrone soup featuring canned vegetables and thawed meatballs then you've found the right place.  On a number of occasions I've had decent Italian food at their older location at Scottsdale/Carefree Highway but at their new establishment the owners have hired cooking staff that serve substandard Italian fare.  Louie and his wife need to be sampling what's cooking in their new kitchen.  For now, stick with their pizzas and salads."}
{"text":"Kinda wish I would have went to AJ's instead and bought some penne with rao's vodka sauce instead.  Food was very average, and portion size was small compared to most Italian places.   Wasn't cheap either.  Overall not a good value."}
{"text":"Italian food in Arizona.   Coming from NY, I found this place to be lovely with great food.  Perhaps because they're from the NY area as well.  Food was delicious"}
{"text":"Had heard a lot of good things about this place so we just tried it. The food was pretty good albeit a tad pricey for what it is but the service was just horrible. I'm guessing that they were understaffed or something like that but our waiter was pretty much nonexistent. Our drinks came after our salads and after our dinners (none of which arrived quickly). I actually had to get up from our table and track him down in order to pay our bill. As we were leaving, the manager asked how things were and we told her. While she apologized, nothing else was forthcoming. I'm guessing that it might be a better placed than what we experienced but we won't be in any big rush to try it again."}
{"text":"Just tried the gluten-free crust pizzas from Uncle Louie last night. I was very happy that it was much better than the frozen variety available in the grocery store! It was good! I've had gluten-free crusts at several places in the north valley and have gotten so disappointed I stopped even trying new places. I just get salad instead.   Glad I tried the GF pizza at Uncle Louie. It was crispy and had a nice toasty flavor. The toppings were fresh and flavorful as ever. Very good GF pizza-- recommended!"}
{"text":"Had the same experience as K.F. when we walked in.  No one was there to seat us and no seemed too anxious to do so.   If the food was good, we might have been able to forgive that, but it just wasn't good at all.  Started w/ the fried calamari which was soggy.  Both my husband and I had a pasta dish which neither of us enjoyed.   Don't know if the pizza is any better, but we won't be going back to find out."}
{"text":"One of my favorite casual Italian restaurants in North Scottsdale!  Used to eat at their old location in Terravita, but prefer their new location much better near Whisper Rock. Chef Michael does a great job and everything is delicious!  My favorite dishes are the Osso Bucco - also known as their \"Awesome Bucco\" and their Shrimp Scampi!  The bar is really great at the new location and it is always fun to sit and meet all the locals!  Uncle Louie always has some great appies like their fresh oysters and one night, he even flew in fresh stone crabs from Florida!  My favorite hostess in the World is Marie and it is always a pleasure to go there when both Lou and Marie are around as they both make you feel at home! They also have a very nice outdoor patio with heated lamps."}
{"text":"Old location was great and had character. Now it's overpriced, average food and ambiance is lackluster."}
{"text":"We absolutely love Uncle Louie's Restaurant.  The food is delicious and the entire staff is amazing.  We will be recommending the restaurant to all our friends."}
{"text":"Nothing special...  We didn't try the pizza, which is the attraction.  We had minestrone soup to start. Cubed fresh veggies and a nice broth. Spaghetti and meatballs, pistachio crusted sea bass, and I requested a special plate of meatballs coated in mozzarella and marinara round out the service.  The fish was very nice. The meatballs were average...  If my glass was kept full, the tea was served with a tea bag and the fish didn't have go back I guess we would of had a nice dinner.  Don't see a reason to be back."}
{"text":"We came here last night- the food was good. Our mussels were a little over cooked, the veal and penne pasta was solid and service was great. I do wish there was more of an ambiance in there, it's a bit bright for a dinner restaurant/date night."}
{"text":"we arrived at 5:00 PM.  Someone served us water and bread and said our server would be right with us.  No one else ever came.  Then a man walked in and sat down at a table and immediately was served.  We watched the staff chatting, drinking sodas, putting on makeup.  No one ever came over to us and asked if we wanted a drink.  We decided to give them 8 minutes to pay attention to us.  Never happened.  Have never been to a restaurant where we were ignored.  We got up and left.  We did find a restaurant in Carefree, Giordano's.  It was excellent and the service was great.  We would suggest that you by-pass Uncle Louie and go to Giordano's.  I went to Uncle Louie's website to see if I could contact them and tell them about the horrible service, but they don't have a \"contact us\" option.  We used to love Uncle Louie's.  So sad it has gone so far down hill.  Apparently they don't pay attention to their staff anymore."}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant in far North Scottsdale! The owners, Lou and Marie are ALWAYS there and could not be nicer.  The food is the best Italian in the whole Phoenix area! Go enjoy it and say Hi to Marie and Lou."}
{"text":"Service slow to nonexistent. Calamari soggy and obviously cooked in old grease. Pizza greasy and soggy. Highly disappointed."}
{"text":"The place has the best pizza!  I have a regular craving for their four seasons pizza.  As the name might indicate it has four different toppings and you get two slices of each.  Cajun shrimp, prosciutto, olive, and mushroom and onion. The Cajun shrimp and the prosciutto is just fantastic!  Add a very tasty Greek salad which goes perfectly with the pizza.  We have it almost once a week to go; but also dine in occasionally and service is always nice.    I am giving the 5 stars for the pizza, Greek salad and eggplant.  The eggplant is great, it has a meat like quality but is all eggplant.    When in North, North Scottsdale visit your Uncle Louie,  you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Why would you go here when Nicks and Tomassos are nearby?  Pizza is terrible, service so so ( the bread guy literally threw it at us) and the food is mediocre at best.  And the meatballs are better at Costco.  Forget it."}
{"text":"The food and service are excellent.  We are from Denver, Colorado and look forward to going to Uncle Louie's every time we are in Cave Creek. We have never had a service experience or a meal that was not exceptional. We would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"A strip mall restaurant that evidently has a strong local following.  Mostly older, well to do types from the gated communities in the area.  Small bar, huge wine list, and ordinary decor.  Waiter was a bit too familiar, and the prices of pizzas are out of line.  One pizza, two beers, and a glass of mediocre white wine are not worth over 50$.  But there you go for North Scottsdale area.  Their pizza sauce is pretty good and they had an Italian lager on draft, which is pretty rare."}
{"text":"Overpriced for basic pasta dishes and pizza. Couple that with the owners speaking mostly to people they know and well, its certainly nothing to write home about..."}
{"text":"sold to a different owner. not sure what's going on!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in a beautiful shopping center in North Scottsdale.  I had a salad and a pasta dish and the food was great... I was pretty stuffed after eating.  Service was friendly and the place looks good.  Overall, I'm a fan and I'll be back."}
{"text":"We are regular customers and this is certainly one of our favorite restaurants.  The service has always been great (especially with Fabio), the owners are friendly, and the food is great. We have had several items on the menu and have enjoyed them all."}
{"text":"Neighborhood favourite maybe...However, Food is overpriced. $ 17 for Lasagna - you would expect some wow factor. Well, don't get me wrong it was good, but the $ 17 price tag left me blah!  On top of that, the portion was tiny and accompanied by a ridiculously small and uninteresting piece of garlic bread.  My taste buds convinced me that my homemade pasta and pizza (pictured) won their return visits. And I can drink all the vino and espresso I want without a guilt trip and go straight to sleep like a bambino. Thanks for your loyalty tastebuds!"}
{"text":"First time visiting from the Midwest and stopped at what we thought was nice looking restaurant. Not very busy but we were seated in the back next to the restrooms and kitchen. Anything resting on the table for more then a few seconds was taking away including half of our appetizers silverware and drinks.  Ordered entrees and waited a least 20 minutes for them to arrive. Very disappointing the portion sizes. Back home and around the Midwest for the same price you take home a box full of leftovers. Not here left still hungry. The food was good but micro portions. We will keep looking for another good Italian restaurant just not here"}
{"text":"This is a community restaurant. I noticed a lot of take-out orders. The menu was interesting with a little of everything. Pizza, soup, salads, sandwiches, pasta dishes, seafood and appetizers. I enjoyed the meal. They have very attractive, young ladies as waiters who were very knowledgeable, helpful and personable."}
{"text":"A local favorite!    Uncle Louie personally greets everyone.  It was a busy Friday night but we were able to enjoy dining on the patio.  Very comfortable setting with the fireplace and the heaters on.  Service was good which the servers are always attentive.  I typically order the Dalmon Piccata which I have always enjoyed, however, tonight was disappointing in that it was under-cooked when first served.  The server was apologetic and did serve me a fresh new dish.  To my dismay, the salmon was once again under-cooked. Chicken Parmigiana was so delicious!  The vegetables and the salad were delicious though.    The entree was taken off of our bill and we were treated to a delicious dessert of Tiramisu for the inconvenience.  Despite this experience, I would still recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I Love this place. First you are always greeted with a big smile, it make me feel happy. Of course the food is great and the service is fast and very friendly. I love the lobster ravioli. My friends organized my birthday lunch there and it was fantastic."}
{"text":"I was really hoping to love this place but was not impressed especially for what you pay for the entrees'.  Table water was disgusting, service was inadequate (placed a salad on the bill when they should not have, barely saw our waitress and when we did she was rushed and when we asked for a to go box for half of a meal left over - they brought out a tiny container and acted surprised when I advised them that it wasn't going to work).  I met the owner Louie and he is the one bright spot in an otherwise disappointing experience.  Will not be back !!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service on my visit to this place, which is incredibly rare.  St.Louis-style toasted raviolis were delicious, and interesting with the creamy marinara dipping alternative.  My marg pizza had some of the most delicious tomato chunks I've ever had on a pizza, so incredibly sweet and yummy.  Crust had great color and texture too.  Cheese was alright.  Pasta options looked good, but I've saved those for next time.  Quite pricey, but I suppose this is a nice area so it's not so out of line."}
{"text":"This is truly authentic Italian food and reminds me of Little Italy in New York City. Our party had veal piccata, lasagna, lobster ravioli and the calamari.  All were delicious. Service was excellent and and the atmosphere was lovely. Great place for parties of six or less.Owners are very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Lovely place. Great food. Marvelous environment. The pizza was divine as was the Veal.  Nice little place"}
{"text":"The best Italine restaurant in Phoenix and Scottsdale!!!       Ed Altman"}
