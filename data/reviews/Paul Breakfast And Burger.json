{"text":"Nice little place to grab a bite,came here after walking at the zoo for hours. Burgers are pretty big and fries are good. Customer services is really polite they seem to have some regulars coming here and I received a free tote."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 20 years , even before it was called pauls ! Great burgers and old school fries . Friendly service and always quick !  I disappeared for a few years as I moved away and when I came back to visit they recognised me lol nice to be remembered. But ya the food is great and people are nice . Give them a try for sure !"}
{"text":"Love coming here! This place serves great dishes the whole family can enjoy! I love getting their large poutine on the side as I enjoy my scrambled eggs and toast! This family run restaurant serves food fast too!"}
{"text":"Great spot! Family run, super nice people! Definitely try the burger, delicious and reasonably priced. The western sandwich is awesome, perhaps a bit pricey but its big and could be two meals. Close to the zoo so stop by on your way in or out!"}
{"text":"Really nice place. Got the big breakfast, 6oz steak w/ 3 eggs and fries. Would def come back to try more food!"}
