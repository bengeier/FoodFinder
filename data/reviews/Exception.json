{"text":"I only went once for a bday party so I havent really had a rich glimpse of the place. But their menu is very large, the food is great, staff really welcoming, and the atmosphere is very cosy for families and friends!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Try the shakshuka for $16. It is divine! Prices are higher because it's kosher, but the quality is outstanding. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"This is a Kosher dairy restaurant which means there is no meat, but plenty of cheese and fish based food. I didn't know what to expect since their online presence is sparse and the reviews that you can find are not very good. Luckily I was pleasantly surprised!  The food was great, the atmosphere was nice and the staff were very good. The kitchen was also efficient, so we didn't have to wait long for our food even though the place was pretty busy and we were a party of 7. I had the salmon entrée which comes with grilled vegetables and your choice of starch. I got the mashed potatoes... I'm a sucker for mashed potatoes. Everything was cooked to perfection and the portion was more than fair. My dinning partner to the left got the mac and cheese and I got to try a forkfull. It was probably the best restaurant mac and cheese we've ever tried! Super cheesy and creamy and topped off with toasted herb bread crumbs.  I finished the meal off with a homemade blueberry apple crumble with vanilla ice cream. Decadent.  If you keep kosher, or even if you don't, I highly recommend this restaurant. P.S, the pizza looked amazing!"}
