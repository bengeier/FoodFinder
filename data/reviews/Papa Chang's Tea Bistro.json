{"text":"A few days ago I visited this new Papa Chang's, I felt so disappointed. I ordered the salty fish cakes and roasted milk tea to take out, at the first they told me to wait for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes they said they don't have the salty fish cakes, but they can give me the deep fried fish cakes. However, when I went home I found that they gave me the salty fish cakes but not the deep fried one......Plus, I was waiting for the drinks at least 15 minutes, even it was already done. There were 4 to 5 servers were just standing next to the bar, but they just keep chatting and no one realized that the drink was ready. The \"bartender\" didn't tell us too because he was busy on discussing the duty roster or studying the drinks? I think I may not come back to this location despite I like Papa Chang's. I think this store was too new, so the waitress were not very familiar to the working process."}
{"text":"Having been a fan of it's other location in Markham, I was pleasantly surprised to learn of this new location. I liked the atmosphere f this second restaurant but I think the food is better at its Markham location.   Food Ordered there signature beef noodle soup. I liked the texture of the fresh hand pulled noodles. That was the best part but I thought the beef wasn't tender enough and not much vegetables. Portion size was decent.   I also ordered a minced pork rice for takeout. That was a disappointment. The rice portion was okay but it came with an unproportionally small portion of minced pork and no vegetables.   Atmosphere Came on a weekday and even then most tables were filled. Service was fast and attentive."}
{"text":"Similar menu to the original Papa Chang in east Markham. Quite a small restaurant, probably about 20-25 seats, in a plaza that is always packed for parking. There was a short line when we went on a saturday night, but the line moved quickly.  The beef noodles had pickled greens that make the broth a little tangy compared to the shanghai / Chinese beef noodles. The brisket wasn't thoroughly marinated and a bit lacking in flavour.  The omelet pancake is a great surprse. The thin crepe wraps around some egg, pork floss, lettuce and some thousand island dressing. Small enough to share as a snack or can be your main if you plan to order popcorn chicken (must order for Taiwanese food).  They have a special everyday from 3-5 (?) and you can get the minced meat rice with sausage and some popular dishes for a reduced price.  Seating is not super comfortable, but I'd come back for some takeout whenever I need a popcorn chicken fixing."}
{"text":"Yum! I was so happy to discover Papa Cheung has come to us closer to the west side :)!   Food is food and service is great! The inside is also really cute and roomy compared to the 16th location.   I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This visit was a whole lot better than the last. The waitress was nice, the food tasted great and there were not rude attitude in the atmosphere.  I got my usual, the fried pork chop bento, with the combo this time. It came with a pudding, a drink and a slice of pineapple. The pineapple and pudding were a bit extra but the drink was really good.  The bento this time had enough of the minced meat under the fried pork chop and it was were portioned and well made. (Not dry like last time)  The visit this time showed that the store manager cares about the reviews and actually fixes them.  **This place is a whole lot better so come and get your Taiwanese groove on!"}
{"text":"I ordered a fried chicken with rice. It came with three side dishes, yam, lettuce, and fish cake.   Side Dishes:  The yam is tasty and sweet. I believe they added sugar when cooking it. It is on the hard side. They may need to cook it a bit longer. The lettuce on the other hand is quite plain. Looks like just cooked in boiling water.  The fish cake is slightly spicy.  All three side dishes have three contrasting tastes.  Main Dish: The chicken tastes good and not very greasy. The rice underneath is a bit hard. Need to chew longer before swallowing it."}
{"text":"Instead of waiting for them to call you in, they have an electronic system that sends you a text message when your seat is ready. The service was very fast; my food came out in less than 10 mins.  The food was decent; the rice dishes are pretty oily but the other dishes were pretty good, not too salty. Their popcorn chicken is the best."}
{"text":"Location/Service Along Highway 7, it's in the plaza right across from Commerce Gate where Yu Seafood and a Chinese Dim Sum restaurant is. Lots of parking available, but it is a relatively busy plaza. Simple decor with plenty of seating available compared to their original location. Staff were nice and fast with our requests.  Food I liked how there is a wider variety of menu items to choose from - actually had a hard time choosing cause I really love to eat Taiwanese food. Ended up order a bento - braised pork belly with preserved vegetables. This came with a drink, watermelon and mango pudding (~$12.50).  I'm not sure if the bistro's prices were higher compared to their other locations; or if they had a different chef too. But something about it didn't feel quite right. I was a little surprised on the portion - which was less than expected. Although the preserved vegetables had no issue, the braised pork was a little tough to eat - little disappointed with the results. Watermelon/winter melon drink was perfect fine. The mango pudding was too sweet for my tasting - but having it as a combo was something extra.   I generally enjoy Papa Chang and would often buy it to go, but this location is a little off to me. Would probably go to their original or Pacific Mall location for my personal preference. It's still new and running, hopefully they work our some minor kinks and details to make me bump up the rating and come back regularly."}
{"text":"I was in this plaza for wonton noodles, but changed my mind last minute.  This taiwanese restaurant seating arrangement is a little awkward and crowded, but I guess their space is limited, so can't blame them.  I order a set lunch, pop corn chicken, and a roll that has a thick piece of fried egg as the wrapper.  The flavours were quite good.  I loved the pop corn chicken, so very tasty with the five spice powder and basil.  Not bad, but I think it is a little bit pricey for the tight space.  I think it was around $25 before tax.  I would comeback for the pop corn chicken though."}
{"text":"There are three locations and I've tried all of them. This is the best location out of the 3. They provide unique Taiwanese Snack that you must try. If you love eating deep fried food, then you must try their popcorn chicken and fish on the stick."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on a weekday...good value for money. I had the popcorn chicken value meal...for 12.99 you get a bento box, drink, fruit and pudding. The chicken was crispy and tasty. The rice underneath had some sauce and toppings. The wintermelon iced tea was refreshing. The pudding was not heavy.  Their chili oil which you can add for 50cents looked and tasted homemade. The rootbeer tasted weird to me."}
{"text":"I was skeptical of this place at first because I don't usually go out for Chinese food. But since I have never tried Taiwan food and am looking to visit Taiwan soon, I thought I would give this place a chance.   I opted not to get the set meals which are $12.99 and come with an entree, side dishes, a drink, dessert and fruit.  Instead, I opted for the Popcorn Chicken on rice ($6.95) and a crepe with egg and pork meat floss. The Popcorn chicken on rice was packed! It didn't seem like a lot of food but it was super filling. The food came fast and the chicken crunchy, and flavourful. It had the perfect blend of spices. The rice has some type of soya based sauce on it (the one they use with the preserved meat and vegetable) and the side dishes included a fried vermicelli, a bean sprout dish and a cream corn. All of these dishes were very complimentary to the popcorn chicken.  The egg and pork meat floss crepe ($4.95) was very good. It was better than I thought it would taste. It was the perfect blend of juicy-ness from the pork floss, the aromatic flavour of the egg and the crunchy and refreshing taste from the lettuce from the wrap. This is something I would definitely come back to eat again.   For the price, service and the little time it takes for the food to be served, this is a great place for a quick lunch or even dinner. I went on a Monday night and it wasn't too busy but still had a decent amount of people.  Next time I will try their drinks."}
{"text":"Visited on a Monday around 1pm - it was a public holiday so it was probably more busy than usual. Went with my mom and brother, and dropped them off to get a spot in line while I looked for parking. We live closeby and always find parking to be a bit of a challenge in this plaza. Got lucky and found a spot without any major difficulty. The wait was around 10 mins, and then we were seated promptly (the queue was around 3 groups the entire time).   Ordered the Signature Beef Noodle Soup while mom and brother both ordered the combos (Taiwanese Sausage & Minced Pork w rice and Popcorn Chicken bento respectively). The taste was alright, but I wish the portion was bigger as I was still hungry afterwards. The noodles were the thick flat ones, and tasted quite nice. Would have liked the beef to be a bit softer, but the serving of beef was big relative to the overall size of the dish. There were also some pickled vegetables along with the noodles and beef.   Had the pudding (and watermelon - nothing special) from the combos as well, and the pudding was nice and light, with a sweet taste at the end from the syrup. Service was fast and attentive, although my noodle dish took much longer to arrive compared to the two rice dishes.   Came for the 20% opening special (until August 15th), and that was what made the value alright (beef noodle normally 8.99). Without it, there are just so many options in the area with similar prices to consider.  Disclaimer: Have not been to the other locations so not sure how the Papa Chang's experience differs (if anything)."}
{"text":"So much hype around Papa Chang's third location in Richmond Hill. This location is in the same plaza as Golden Court and Yu Seafood, tucked away in the back. However, even though it's in the back, it is super busy! Came on a Sunday afternoon at 2pm during soft opening and it was still a 15 minute wait for table for 4!  Onto the food. The popcorn chicken C04 is really, really good, as well as their chicken cutlet. The noodle N03 that is served with the chicken cutlet is egg noodles, and it is so so. I'd say get the rice instead. The signature beef noodle N06 was decent. We also ordered a pork floss omelette P01 and this was also a tasty choice. You can't go wrong with pork floss!  Their value combos include a drink and a dessert, for an extra $5. This may seem like a good deal, as all the drinks are minimum $5 anyways. However, their drinks suck! I'd save the $5 and go across the street afterwards to Commerce Gate where you have all the elite bubble tea places to choose from!  In summary, make sure you order the popcorn chicken! Their rice is better than the noodles and don't upgrade to the combos unless you want a crappy drink!  3.5 stars!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  Like what many people have already written, it feels like the portions here are a bit smaller than their original location. But if i think hard about it, i think it's the proportions. I've been loving the traditional Taiwanese sausage with minced pork rice, but i noticed that there's less minced pork for this location than their original, with the same amount of rice. The prices are definitely higher as well, and they tried to mask that with the \"meal deals\" but when i costed it out, i'm not really getting a deal. I would say that the quality of the dishes are the same.  The servers are nice and friendly enough - they're young and ambitious but don't really know what they're doing, whereas their original location have seasoned and efficient servers.   I would probably still go to their original location because they've always been consistent with portions, quality, and service. I would probably event prefer the takeout location by 14th and warden, since traffic is usually bad around this area of richmond hill."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food was great! Staff was polite and friendly! Everything i expect when eating out. Food portion was perfect! Really enjoyed the minced pork with rice.   Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Papa Chang's is one of my favorite places for my Taiwanese fix in Toronto. This location is amazing and therefore is also a bit pricier than the other stores. Papa Chang's quality of food is pretty good, delicious, and quite authentic. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the pudding that came with the value combo. The pudding looked good but all I tasted was sugar. Anyways, service here is pretty quick and friendly. And currently, if you like their page on Facebook, you get 20% discount on the entire bill during their soft opening. Now is definitely the perfect time to try Papa Chang's if you never tried."}
{"text":"This papa changs franchise is nice. Small shop but very clean. I like the idea of the combos. One improvement I would suggest is putting some soup noodles in the combo section. I wanted a drink with my meal but all the combos are rice dishes. That being said, the food tastes good.   No stinky tofu smell which I appreciate a lot seeing as it IS a taiwanese place. Service was polite and efficient. The prices are very standard for richmond hill.  The bbq chicken pancake thing my friend ordered was sooooo delicious. The popcorn chicken is not bad. I think I've tasted better."}
{"text":"Authentic Taiwanese food! Love their popcorn chicken.. very freshly fried and side dishes are so delicious. Resturant is very clean and staffs are super nice! I would totally come back again!!"}
{"text":"So I dropped by here with a few friends for dinner. I've always want to get some authentic Taiwanese food. However the original location is a bit out of the way. The new restaurant is at a convenient location. That's a plus.   Decor for this place is a bit more trendy. Lots of individual tables and for a party of 5 to 6 is still okay, anything larger will be hard.   The menu is the same between the restaurants. I chose my go to dish, Taiwanese sausage and minced meat on rice with a shareable popcorn chicken appetizer and my friends ordered the popcorn chicken bento and braised beef noodle. Portions are alright, taste ain't too bad. I mean the food is alright? Just no thrill. I agree with another review, the food just isn't the same as the original location.   Service wise, they are pretty attentive. Wish they turn down the loud music so a conversation can be done with friends."}
{"text":"A little disappointed as this location isn't as good as their main location on 16th and hwy48. Friendly staff and clean interior, but I find the portions to be slightly smaller and the flavours weren't as good.  Ordered their value set meal which came with an entree (rice dish), a drink (certain flavours), some fruit (got watermelon) and homemade pudding.  Minced pork and Taiwanese sausage rice - I like the taste of their Taiwanese sausage as it was sweet but not too sweet with a hint of salty and just the right consistency. Minced pork mixture was good but not enough for the rice it came with.   Green milk tea with tapioca - added tap for extra 75 cents, but unfortunately my tapioca was overcooked. The drink itself was creamy and flavourful, but the tapioca kind of ruined the experience.  Pudding was not the best. Very solid and not as jiggly as what I envision pudding to be. Caramel taste was decent.   Also ordered popcorn chicken. Great flavours. Not too salty nor oily. Sauce could've been stronger in flavour.  Not sure if I would come back to this location. Possibly for take out as they have specials."}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is a good portion. Location is convinient. Although the place is a bit cramped.  They are giving 20% discount until Aug 15. Hurry and try their food."}
{"text":"I have actually never been to the original location so I am a blank page.   Devour is was well done in this smaller store.   Service was polite and efficient.   They has combos that came with a rice bowl, pudding, watermelon and cold drink for about $11-12 which is not cheap for lunch.   They also have Bento boxes but I found them quite small (portion size).   The bowl rices is my choice-decent price and good portion size (not to mention good tasting).   A good place try pretty authentic Taiwanese food and a nice environment."}
{"text":"It's weird the the beef noodle is non spicy in this location and you have to pay extra to have it spicy compared to the same store but at a different location. I think I prefer the location at pacific mall or other. I did not like how their picture showed 2-3 slices of oranges as their combo selection but when i got my combo i only got 1 piece of pineapple. I get it if oranges are not in season and they have to change up to a different fruit but from 2-3 slices to just 1!! maybe the prices should have an adjustment too."}
{"text":"3.5*   The first time I came here was with a group of friends, and the second time was me ordering takeout as I work in the plaza.   I've always wanted to try this place out as Papa Chang's is well known for their authentic Taiwanese food. This location is located on West Beaver Creek, across from Commerce Gate. They have seating for about 20 people with a variety of splitting amongst tables. We came as 7 people and were given menus and water. We each ordered an assortment of food, ranging from combos to the braised beef noodle.   Their value combos are okay, however, I felt that their food does have quite a bit of MSG in it. Their braised beef on rice is delicious, and comes with a side of pickled veggies to combat the oiliness. The combo includes a drink, a dessert, along with a piece of fruit. Service could be more attentive, as I had to follow up with the drink AND the pudding without the restaurant being busy. With tax and tip, the combo came to about $15..not too bad. I'll have to try their original location to do a proper comparison of which I like better.   I had their appetizers on another occasion and the fish cakes are super yummy, albeit a tad salty. Their popcorn chicken which I ordered on my most recent visit for takeout lacked seasoning, however the chicken was juicy. =(  May or may not be back"}
{"text":"So I took my parents to this place and it was our first time. First off the things we wanted to order wasn't avaliable. The waitress there barely spoke English and stricktly mandarin. Over all it was expensive and the food wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Just came back from a road trip and thought about papa chang on the way back. i think this location deserves at least 1 star since i never did get a chance to try their food. i hope its nt as bad as their service. The both of us walked in and tried asking for a table for 2. We had been clearly ignored by both waitresses and the barista. We then tried asking and waving and was clearly ignored again. there were 3 empty tables and the place wasnt even closing. i thought i didnt want to yell out for service that the whole little 400 sq ft of restaurant would hear us so me and my girlfriend left for a quick dinner next door. it was fav cafe that earnes our business tonight. i didnt want to go at first but she said its not bad. My girlfriend was right. it was not bad. the food was half descent but most importantly we received service right away. We where acknowledged right away. The place was also half empty and we gotten a table right away.  i would say papa chang at Richmond hill would never earn my business no matter how hungry i am."}
{"text":"Tried Papa Chang's for the first time very pleasant to be greeted with a good morning as this was just before lunch time. The location in Richmond Hill seems small it was filling up fast shortly after 11:30am on a weekend.  We ordered the two popular items signiture beef noodle soup the picture in the menu looked like a dry noodle dish because of the plate anyways it tasted okay and portion was good noodle was chewy.  Taiwanese sausage and mixed pork on rice was good could have been it litte bit hotter in my opinion.  Will come back and try popcorn chicken next time.  No credit cash and debit only"}
{"text":"I have been to the original location too but I prefer this location because it's more spacious. I can't compare which location serve better food because I have only tried noodles at the original location. I love their popcorn chicken! Juicy meat and light batter. Generous portion and friendly service as well. They only accept debit or cash. If you want cheap and tasty food, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"OMG!!! Papa Chang's has opened a third location, this time in Richmond Hill. The 3rd location is located in the Hwy 7 and West Beaver Creek Plaza, right next to Fav Cafe. This is the same plaza as Yu Seafood, Golden Court and Crab Harbour.  I was in the area today to pick up some items when I saw the new business sign: Papa Chang's Tea Bistro. My eyes widened immediately. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the Papa Chang sign and thought I was dreaming. I quickly went up to the place and saw a notice on the door that said they just opened over the weekend.  For their grand opening, this new location is offering  a 20% discount promo if you like their FB page. The promo ends August 15th.  I told my friend about this new place and we both got excited. We decided to stop by later for a quick bite. We got there exactly at 920 pm and they told us it was last call soon.  Browsing the nice colourful and glossy menu, all the items were available to be ordered. In addition, the food items are exactly the same as the original location. Nothing seems to be missing. new on the menu is a vast listing of bbt milk tea drinks.  Popcorn chicken is definitely a must and is one of their specialty item. We quickly ordered that, the fish skewers and the Taiwanese Beef Omelette. The food came out quite fast. Other than the food, we shared a can of apple cider. All in all, with the discount, it was $10 per person..tax and tips included. Food wise: taste and quality are exactly the same as the original location. I am so glad they kept the consistency. Could have ordered more but could only eat so much. Definitely can't wait to go back and order more of my favourite items from Papa Chang.   This location has 32 seats and is definitely more comfortable and colourful than the one on 16th  It feels definitely more relax and enjoyable and u don't feel as stressed.  How much do I love Papa Chang? well, I once waited 35+ mins for a table for two and once we placed the order, we waited another 45 minutes for the food..  I WAS SO STARVING AT THAT TIME... This is how much I loved that place. Since then, the food comes out super fast.   Papa Chang is the #1 Best Taiwanese food in town!!! There is no comparison between other places that offer Taiwanese food. I am quite mesmerized by their vast selection of food items. I think I tried almost everything on their menu.  People complained about how far it is and how small the place it.. well, now they can't complain anymore since there is another franchise in town and the restaurant is much bigger in size.    I highly recommend this restaurant and to anyone visiting Toronto!!! :D  A MUST TRY!!  Congrats on the new location Papa Chang's"}
{"text":"Advice: stick with the original location if you like it. I always go to their original location in Markham, trying their new location was A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! Wanted to order curry but it's sold out.  Wanted to order just a simple drink diet coke but they don't have it. Food tastes different than the original location,  the noodle is totally different.  After eating 80% of the food,  found a little short hair in the potato side of the bento! UNACCEPTABLE!  Will never come back again!"}
{"text":"Whenever I have cravings for Taiwanese food I always come here. I have been here several times with my hubby. The services were so so the food was delicious.   We always order spicy minced pork on rice with sausages. Every single time I would tell my hubby I hoped they provided fresh sliced garlic because they go well with sausages. The oyster omelette was yummy, but hubby thought it was bland.    The portion for the minced pork on rice is pretty decent. Although the price is on the higher side we still come once in a while because I cant think of any better/ authentic Taiwanese restaurants in GTA."}
{"text":"This plaza sucks for parking compared to the one at McCowan/16th, but the location is great.  The value set seems new and the prices look a bit higher than the other one but given its location, it makes sense.  It's a pretty small place with maybe around 40 seats? But they bring the food and drinks out pretty quick.  I ordered the braised pork combo and it was good, the pork belly wasn't too fatty and it was soft. The meat to rice ratio is ok too. It came with a drink which is primarily the reason why I got it and it was refreshing. The pudding wasn't as good as it looked, really bland.  Nothing overly special but great place to get your Taiwanese fix."}
{"text":"Great little unique place. Fast service. Very tasty food for a very affordable and reasonable price. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"So happy about their 3rd location. Food is just as good as the original location and about the same amount of seating. If you are looking for good Taiwanese food, this is my go to."}
{"text":"I was in the plaza to get lunch on Saturday when I saw Papa Chang's sign. At first I thought it was a \"Papa Chang's wanna be store\" because I had never heard that they were opening a new location, but when I saw the famous logo of Papa Chang's I knew it was the real one! I went with my husband and we were checking to see if it was already opened or if it was still under construction. Apparently it was opened and had couple tables occupied by customers. We both were so happy and immediately told our friends that Papa Chang's opened a new location that's closer to us.   They food offerings were pretty much the same as the original location, but at this location they added combo menu, which includes one of their famous dishes, bubble tea, pudding and fruit. I got the minced pork and sausage combo and my husband got the popcorn chicken combo. The taste was same as the original location, it was delicious and the portions were? also the same size. The combos we got were about $11-12 each and the other combo options were around same price. We got the combo because we knew we could get discount if we liked their page on Facebook lol.   When I paid I asked since when they opened the restaurant there and the server said it was the first day. No wonder I couldn't find it on yelp yet that day to check in.   The reason I gave them 4 stars is because they had this oil/frying smell that bothered me a lot as soon as I entered the restaurant. Maybe they had issue with their venting. I hope they fix it as soon as possible because I have never had a problem with the other location.   Other than that, I'm super happy they opened this new location on highway 7, which is so much closer to home!"}
{"text":"I love Papa Chang for years now and i was so pleasantly surprised when they opened this location less than 10 minutes drive from my house (used to drive 45 to the old location). Food is just as good, even though i feel like the portions are a touch smaller. Service is ok, but i do miss the overly nice ladies from 16th Avenue! :) If you guys want amazing tasting Taiwanese food, please go to Papa...the signature beef soup, the pork belly, the minced pork on rice...and of course the popcorn chicken and Taiwanese pickles, everything is delicious!  Thanks Papa Chang for never disappointing!!!"}
{"text":"I like their combo, for $10 you can get a minced pork on rice, pudding, fruit and 1 drink!! The drink is not that fountain pop, it's handmade milk tea or green tea!! It's a great deal for lunch. And they even offer 20% discount before August 15th for their side opening promotion!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food here isn't as good as their original location. The service is no-nonsense, amenable and on par with similar restaurants in the area.  The Taiwanese sausage + minced pork on rice was decent, greasier than usual (huge amount of oil at the bottom of my bowl) while the sausage was dry.  The BBQ chicken sesame flat bread was fine, the sauce was sweeter than I would have liked but otherwise it was fine.  The popcorn chicken bento was disappointing- the chicken didn't seem to be freshly fried and wasn't as good as expected. This was part of a combo and came with a drink (which was okay), a slice of watermelon, and a very gross pudding. The pudding is made in the kitchen (as we saw the imprint of a \"SOLO\" cup on the top of the pudding) but it seems to be from a low-quality powder mixture. Just thinking about that pudding makes me feel grossed out.  I'd only come back if I was feeling lazy, had a craving for Taiwanese food and didn't want to go far to get it. Otherwise, I will pass on visiting this location again."}
{"text":"Love this new location, so close to home!  This new Papa Chang's Tea Bistro has everything the original location has and more. I love that they offer combos that include a watermelon slice, pudding and a large drink.  I absolutely love the minced pork and Taiwanese sausage with rice as well as the popcorn chicken bento. The menu is slightly price ($11-13 per combo) but it includes a lot of food!  Their drinks are delicious (I recommend the milk green tea!!) and can also be modified similar to Chatime and whatnot with the ice/sugar levels.  This place can fill up very quickly, but they have a cute little system at the front where you punch in your party size and phone number and they will notify you once a table is available!"}
{"text":"The food was good but service wasn't the greatest. They can't seem to manage the spacing of the table very well either. They put their tables too close. so trying to fit yourself between the tables to get by was near impossible. The SMS ticketing system didn't work for us. And why were we still asked to use the ticketing system when there are clearly seats available? I don't think they have their logistics in place as it has only been a few months since their opening."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS I have to preface this review by saying that the wait staff here are absolutely wonderful.  Sweet natured and polite - to everyone.  This place is adequate.  Don't expect Shilin Market vis a vis variety and/or taste, 'cause this isn't Taipei.  But what they execute here, is done quite well.  However, most of the food is fried.  Regarding the soups:  Background notes of star-anise, sesame oil and chili are there - and it leaves a fragrance in the mouth which is lovely.  The fish cakes (non-fried)  - 3.5/5 Beef soup with noodle - 4/5 Crumbled pork with soya-soaked egg and noodle - 3.5/5  Not salty, not greasy, polite staff.  Portions reasonable size.  Prices reasonable.  More importantly:  patrons are nice which leaves a positive ambience."}
{"text":"My review may be a bit biased because I love Papa Chang's. I accidentally discovered their new location which opened a month ago and am excited to come more often for lunch. The restaurant is small, seating 30 people. Service was quick and attentive and the food came within 5 minutes of ordering.   The chili minced pork, Taiwanese sausage and stewed egg on rice was excellent! You can order the non-spicy version for $1.50 cheaper. As someone who has 0 spicy tolerance, their homemade chili oil (dried chili, fried garlic and onion) was very spicy but very very tasty! I loved that their minced pork sauce was flavorful but not salty, and the entire rice bowl was drenched in the sauce. I also ordered the Taiwanese popcorn chicken and Japanese cabbage cake. Compared to the original location, the cabbage cake here is thicker and tasted more bland- wasabi sauce had no punch to it. It's unlikely that I'll order this from here again.   Their menu is extensive, portions are decent and fairly priced. This place is perfect for a quick bite, bento boxes, lunch combos or sharing with friends/family!"}
{"text":"I saw this new location, which was previously Noodle Mi. I'm giving this place a 2 because I'm very disappointed with their service.  The girl asked me to enter my info with their snappy system to add myself to their waiting list, which is dumb because why did I have to serve myself? The screen said there were few tables ahead of us and they'll send me a text so I walked around to kill some time. By the time I got back, another girl asked how many ppl so I said I already checked into their system. She had no clue what I was talking about and said oh there's a free table but I didnt get a text!  The table was inbetween two other tables so we had no way to get in and the waitress just walked away.   Customers ended up moving the table for us.  The food was A-ok. I still prefer Noodle Mi.  The Value combo seems pricey esp since it's almost double the price just to get a drink, pudding and slice of watermelon.  I rather go to Chef Papa to get a Presotea for $2.50.  They should get rid of their crappy, I mean snappy system."}
{"text":"3.5 is my rating.  Was so happy they opened a Papa Chang's in Richmond Hill. Of all taiwanese places I've tried in Toronto, I still like Papa Chang's the most.  Taiwanese Sausage and minced pork on rice value combo ($11) The combo comes with one of their taiwanese drinks, a fruit and pudding. The rice doesn't come with egg. The sausage was thick and slightly dry. The minced pork was tasty with rice and the pickled veggies on the side. I had the wintermelon juice, 30% sugar since normally they are really sweet. Tasted nice and refreshing! The pudding was mediocre tough - I believe it was egg pudding with caramel syrup. The pudding essentially was tasteless and relied on the syrup, which was too sweet for my liking.  Big pork intestine vermicelli ($6.99) This came in a giant bowl. The soup was thick and saucy. Quite salty, but the flavor wasn't on point with the traditional ones I've had in Taiwan. Lots of ingredients though, not just the pork intestines but also fish cakes.   Meat floss omelette ($5.49) This was like an egg crepe wrapping some veggies and pork floss. The pork floss really makes a big difference in flavor. Tasted good but I would have preferred the outer omelette/crepe wrap texture to be crispy than soft."}
{"text":"I've been to Papa Chang couple times already...for the first time, I was so excited because I simply wanted everything on the menu! I've tried their ?????, ?????, ???, ????, ?????...I find their ????? are way too fat to my taste, I mean the pork. I know this is the  traditional Taiwanese style, just not to my liking; but I can say the taste is pretty good. The rest are all soso, but they do have one of the best ???! When I'm crave for popcorn chicken, Papa Chang is the first place I can think of. It is VERY good!! The sauce that comes with it is sooo delicious. I always ask for the second one. No doubt l will go back for their popcorn chicken."}
{"text":"Average Taiwanese place as the prices cannot be justified with the quantity of food you get for each bowl or bento box. I've had the popcorn chicken on rice as well as the stewed pork belly on rice. The rice is a bit dry to be honest, and could have some sauce on it. The entrees are just okay in my opinion, it does not have a lot of visual pop or taste amazing. I've had better.  If you pay a bit more you can get a cold milk tea, fruit, and dessert. During my most recent visit, the fruit is a couple thin slices of pineapple. The dessert is the same at this place: factory-made caramel pudding on the dense side."}
{"text":"4.5 stars because I feel like the noodle soup at the 16th and Markham Rd. location is better.  It's hard to beat this place in terms of value. Portions are very generous, prices are cheap and the food is delicious. Food is not too salty or oily. I've already gone twice since the opening. It's THAT good!."}
