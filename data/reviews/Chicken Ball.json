{"text":"As a first time buyer you'll be amazed with the price and quality of food! 

     But as you continue to buy it you'll find out that the chicken is really not chicken but more flour. The rice can be really dry and may lack taste at times. If it's your first time there then go ahead your going to love it!"}
{"text":"I strongly suggest anyone to disregard this place. They have horrible tasting food. I spent 45$ on a family meal and 85% of it was thrown away cause it tasted nasty and the 2nd day it had an awful smell. Stay away from this place..."}
{"text":"Good food generous portions always ready fast. Food 4 out of 5. Service 5 out of 5.
Our go to place for chinese food
Best bang for buck in Brampton"}
{"text":"This place is okay. I don't think the food is worth the amount of money I paid for though. It's cheap but the taste is okay. I've had better for sure I paid 30 bucks for 3 lunch specials which is 5.75 each and lemon chicken which is 9.15. Delivery is free but the guy almost ripped me off and almost ran off with my 10 (I gave him forty) so I had to remind him that he still owes me 10. He came back saying he doesn't have enough change and could only give me 9. Like what the f? I just let it go as tip or something but that really rubbed me off the wrong way."}
{"text":"When first opened 4 out of 5 stars. Last 2 times we ordered the quality of food was poor. This seems to have happened every time someone new takes over in this location. Once they get a good clientele they raise the prices and cut back on quality and quantity. 2 out of 5 stars and I'm being generous."}
{"text":"Great food, good price and portions.  One of the better places to get chow mien. Service is good. Maybe be a hole in the wall of a restaurant but it's my fav for this type of food."}
{"text":"The staff were friendly and courteous. We ordered in and had the food arrive within the time specified. Generous amounts of food however the menu offered westernized renditions of Chinese food including chicken balls and egg rolls."}
{"text":"This places food is total crap. At least the food I had. I ordered the Chicken Noodles & they were terrible. Lots of cheap veggies (carrots/Bok Choy) with lots of poor taste. I'd say avoid this place."}
{"text":"Normal typical Chinese fast food location with extra large portions that provide good value. There appears to be only one person cooking in the back at lunch, so our food was made sequentially and probably took longer than it should have despite it not being that busy on a weekday lunch. 

The Singapore Rice noodles were good, though the meat content (bbq pork) was sparse and left me wishing for more. The egg drop soup was ok, it was thick with very little taste.

The seating area is very small. Two tables with four seats at each. Sitting by the door meant you felt the cold air everytime someone came in or our. Utensils were thoughtfully wrapped up with soya sauce and hot sauce in a napkin."}
{"text":"Ordered dry chilli chicken and got bits of plain fried chicken and veggies. No sauce at all."}
{"text":"Had a really bad experience last night at Chicken Ball. A chicken dish with beef gravy, pretty gross. Sweet and sour ribs, no meet what so ever. 
The special fried rice is one of the best I will say. But was the only good part of last nights dinner. Only thing that made this a 2"}
