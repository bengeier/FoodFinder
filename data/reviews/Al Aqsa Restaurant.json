{"text":"Awful all around. 
We ordered this from Foodora.  Everything was bad - watery butter chicken, weird tough and overbooked chicken in the \"chilli chicken\", the naan was hard and rigid.
Aside from that, the food was packed in flimsy plastic containers and Saran Wrap.  The containers were broken and food was everywhere.  I had to pick pieces of plastic out of the food.  

Very poor experience.  I would avoid this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was cheap and was delivered quickly.  One of the best beef biryani's I have ever had and the pakoras were melt in your mouth delicious, great veggie samosas too. My only complaint is that I didn't ask for extra of the green chutney.  This place will be a new go-to for me."}
{"text":"Very bare bones Indian restaurant, I only tried the vegetarian dishes, which were hot and yummy and the price was EXTREMELY reasonable.. you can get a combo with mixed vegetable curry, salad, and naan for $5 any time of the day. You can see the menu on Foodora."}
