{"text":"Normally a great place with wonderful good that I go to regularly, but don't go within an hour of closing because they start to strip the buffet then."}
{"text":"The man on the barbecue bar really sucks, though the food on the whole is good at this price. It really sucks to see him when I was eating. Never try it if you want to have a good lunch."}
{"text":"I would have given this restaurant zero stars if the app allowed it. This is a disgusting restaurant. You can find roaches lurching around the food. The 'clean' dishes next to buffet items are mostly dirty. Just look at the bottom of the plate. This restaurant should really be inspected by authorities."}
{"text":"Good food east side of building  outside is absolutely disgusting trash everywhere it's gross"}
{"text":"AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!! This place is an accident waiting to happen. Years ago, they were pretty good. Horrible service there though. Sit much over a half hour and they are bringing your check and \"slowing down\" on drink refills.   We ate there in early January. Food was horrendous. We left early because we couldn't eat any more. We told the manager. They took half off the bill. I told them we would NEVER be back. She told me \"I don't care, that's your choice.\" I couldn't believe it.   So, if you want both bad service and bad food, this is the place to be!   Wish I could give zero stars."}
{"text":"We moved out of state a few years ago and were excited to eat at this restaurant last night. It used to be our favorite chinese place. The service was awful and the food completely tasteless. We paid way too much for a dinner that did not satisfy us. We will not be going back! Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"So...no. Just...no. Before I picked up a plate to start in on the food, I noticed a roach on the buffet. I alerted a waitress, who acted as if it was nothing new, and she removed the tongs the roach was crawling on. Sadly she did not remove the bread the roach had been crawling on before it made its way to the tongs. I quietly walked back to my seat to retrieve my belongings and exited the establishment. I will be calling the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District to log a complaint and make sure they follow up."}
{"text":"We've taken the family multiple times, it's not bad. No to the wonton soup, the wontons are soggy. The garlicky green beans are awesome & General Tso's chicken is good. We always enjoy it, remember: it's a buffet."}
{"text":"I was very excited for late night Chinese, this place closes at 9:30, we got there at 8:45 and from the moment we got there till the moment we left no fresh food was brought out even with more customers walking in. There was none of the food that I wanted out and the food that was there when we got there was not fresh or full In anyway. Have been there a couple times the food is good but it made me extremely mad that I payed $20 to beg for scraps at the end of the night. Employees acted like they were closing an hour early while customers where still coming in. It was an all you can eat buffet but I was barely fool when I left."}
{"text":"Rude came in8:45 close at 9 told us we could eat quick we could if not no do not eat here rude rude"}
{"text":"Short answer: Avoid this place. The Chinese restaurant life has been my family's livelihood since as far as I can remember so trust me. Chinatown, this is NOT how you do business.  Walked in, not greeted, was asked \"How many\" and then quickly led to my table and she pointed to my seat. Waitress didn't smile, asked for my drink and nothing more. I spent the longest time walking around with my plate because the food looks sloppy, the crab rangoons are too pale, and they obviously replaced an old pan of food and put the dry old meat on top. Throw that sht out! It wasn't even worth putting those few dry bits back in the pan. Keep in mind it was 6 PM prime time dinner. The food should not have looked that bad.  It's 10.99 for a dinner buffet and I wasn't about to spend that on that food. I walked out. Yes I didn't try the food but believe me when I say I didn't need to.   Not trying to tear down this restaurant because I know how hard the restaurant life can be. But to keep people coming back you need to have quality and you need to train your staff to be friendly or courteous at the least.   I hope they improve in the future. Otherwise I recommend going to Panda Express (I'm serious) or order out at Best Wok or Golden Harbor."}
{"text":"the variety is huge, but the food isn't the best. however, the price is good, and out of such a wide selection, you're sure to find *something* you like."}
{"text":"I am not sure what to think about this place.  It is big.  The food is mostly fried.    I much preferred the slightly more expensive Crazy Buffet, but since it went out of business a couple times I must have been one of the only ones.    What this place has to offer: Make your own stir-fry, steaks, ice-cream machines, dessert table, many typical American Chinese staples.  Also pizza, salmon, crab legs, chicken wings, soups, sometimes duck, and crab legs.  (The crab legs tend to go quick!)  The problem is that not all of it is that good.  You'll get full, of course, but you might feel a bit guilty afterwards.  Salad bar?  Not really, it's not that kind of place.  Sometimes they have fried shrimp balls, greasy little nuggets of compressed shrimp meat.  They are the best thing here in my opinion.  Terrible for you, like everything else, but delicious.  I am also partial to the fried dough with sesame seeds on the outside and red bean paste on the inside.  They're on the dessert table.  The \"fried meat + syrupy sauce + maybe a vegetable or two\" dishes aren't really to my taste, but they have a lot of them.  There's sweet and sour chicken as well, and dumplings.  The stir-fry options aren't as involved as, say, Flat Top but this place is generally cheaper.  You can get meat mixed in with the veggies at the fry-grill.    The sushi has improved a lot in the time since I started going there.  It is still, definitely, buffet sushi but it's not bad and they seem to make more fairly often.  We go here about once a year, which seems about right to me."}
{"text":"After leaving Walmart myself my wife and two children decided to stop in for some Chinese food it was not that good and there was not that much to choose from.  Judging from the other reviews I'm assuming that we just came at a bad time because the food was hard and cold! I'm giving them two stars because the egg drop soup was pretty good."}
{"text":"We love it here! Sooooo much variety to pick from.Simply delicious. Everyone here is really friendly.Delicious food, great atmosphere. very resonable PRICE!!"}
{"text":"I am surprised to see that more yelp reviewers do not enjoy Chinatown Buffet as much as I do. The food is consistently tasty -- the standard Chinese dishes, the sushi, and the Mongolian barbeque, which I sampled for the first time on Christmas. Some of my favorites include General's Chicken, Pepper Chicken, and Mongolian Pork (or beef or chicken).  Although I love the food here in general, there are a couple of negatives: the desserts and the chairs. The desserts are the general unappealing desserts that seem to be standard at several Chinese buffets. Many of the chairs are in dire need of repair -- torn plastic covering and wobbly.  So ... if you can live with chairs that are in a state of disrepair, his just might be the place to scratch your itch for a variety of Chinese dishes."}
{"text":"It's impressive how filthy this place is. Someone had puked in the bathroom and there the mess sat for all to see and smell. Aside from that the bathroom condition was dirty everywhere. The floor was sticky in the main part of the restaurant and especially around where I sat. Even the area where the staff hung out, where the drinks were dispensed, was very dirty. You would think the staff would pick up trash from the floor, but no. The only worthwhile feature is that the food is plentiful. The quality ranges from poor to mediocre. There are no more crab legs on Sunday. There is no longer fish to be found at the \"sushi-sashimi\" bar. It's veggies and rice only (they used to serve fish, at least last time I was here a year or two ago). I will not return to this restaurant, even though you can stuff your gut for $13 if you so wish. That is not my objective. I like to eat someplace clean with better food."}
{"text":"Nasty. First time I've ever felt DIZZY from eating something. I discovered that the crab rangoon was acceptable, and the red-bean filled donuts were actually kinda good. Otherwise, nothing else even tastes much like food. And that's my opinion after trying one plate of the least unappetizing things I saw. Both my partner and I had seriously uncomfortable stomachs afterwards. If I had to go here again, I'd just eat a million red bean donuts. But I'm pretty sure we won't have the misfortune of being invited here by someone again."}
{"text":"absolutely disgusting. arrived for lunch on a Sunday. not only were they not prepared, the food they did have available was lukewarm and disgusting. warm drinks... this is by far the worst sushi I have ever seen in my life. I managed to stomach one plate of stale, cold chicken and they had the absolute nerve to charge me about $15! I would rather eat a pile of dog dook than eat here again, it would certainly be a healthier, safer alternative."}
{"text":"Went there last night for a family dinner. I use to really like this place but over the years it keeps getting worse and if I could give it a negative star I would. The food was very poor quality and and with all the other choices for Asian food in this town it will be another 5 years before I step back in this place. You have to chase down a server to get a drink refill and I was pushed out of the way several times as employees were walking around shouting into radios about what need to be refilled.   While I was there I walked into the bathroom and it smelled like urine and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months. All the stalls were broken and graffiti everywhere. Both paper town dispensers were out and the sink area was  gross. Makes me wonder if the employees ever wash their hands."}
{"text":"My friend took me there. Price was ok. Everything is just within the normal range. Nothing special."}
{"text":"I am somewhat of a Chinese buffet connoisseur.  It's a family staple to find a Chinese buffet on every vacation that we go on.  It's both a blessing and a curse, but one of my favorites is Chinatown.  They have a huge selection and unlike most places they keep the food fresh.  I have been told it's a good sign when an Asian restaurant is packed with Asians, and this is true here.  They also have a plethora of fresh sushi that is on par with a lot of the sushi places in the area.  I don't get the bad reviews with this place, but my only complaint is the plethora of townies."}
{"text":"If you've only ever lived in Champaign-Urbana, perhaps this restaurant is passable. But if you lived in Chicago for 10 years before coming out here like I did, the Chinese and English languages combined can not describe how bad this place is. Overcooked food that upsets your stomach, wilted, dry vegetables and a poorly lit, dirty restaurant."}
{"text":"I've gone to Chinatown buffet more time than I'd like to admit -- This is your run-of-the-mill Chinese buffet, with lots of Americanized Chinese food and dishes containing Krab (with a K). The food isn't very good, but the only redeeming quality is the all-you-can-eat snow crab legs and Chinese-style crayfish you get on weekend nights. I've been there for lunch once and the quality of food was very different from what you'd see around dinner-time... The worst part was the clams, which were full of sand."}
{"text":"I came here many times. This is one of my fav chinese restaurant. Many varieties of food.  Saturday's lunch deal was good."}
{"text":"Chinatown Buffet is located in Indian Trail next to Genarros in the same plaza as Walmart. The restaurant is extremely basic as far as the buffet items. However, on a busy work day I do not find this to always be such a bad thing. With that said it makes it very easy to get in and out of there and leave full. For dinner on the other hand, not so much. The great thing about having a smaller buffet as they do is that the food seems to always be fresh."}
{"text":"If ya don't want your stomach to wretch, You'd better not eat here!!! The steamed crablegs are favorless and I bit into one of the dumplings (supposedly pork) and I smelled doo-doo!!! I spit it out and kindly told them that I wanted my money BACK! Don't eat here."}
{"text":"Terrible service with bad attitude. They got upset over a party of 20 paying separately.  Deseert is absolutely dry. Automatically putting in a full tip in our checks. They also tried keeping our extra change. Place is peni$"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for dinner..... worst service from Joan the server!  She was very rude, disrespectful, and not friendly at all!!!"}
{"text":"My husband likes it because there is a lot of fish.  I would like to find some vegetable stir fry dishes.  I tried the \"create your own\" and found the flavor (seasoning) to be bland and somewhat distasteful.  I fill up on the honeydew melon and soup.  It would be nice if they offered some vegetable dishes.  I might have eaten the ones with chicken...but those were all described as spicy.  Oh, and I do like \"fried biscuits\" the donut type things with sugar on them..unfortunately, they put the garlic bread and the fried biscuit in the same pan with shared tongs!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here thje other day. Lots of buffet choices, but none seamed to really stand out.Most of the entrees were bland, with no spark. On the good side, they have peel n eat shrimp and a good hot and sour soup. The outside needs attention, and the restroom has graffiti and broken doors...very poor shape. I noted the Health department had some violations posted on the door...but since they were open I thought they must have been minor. Overall it looks dingy inside with need of cleaning and maintenance."}
{"text":"Haven't been back since leaving review and have given up on Chinese buffet since they are all terrible."}
{"text":"I was visiting the Champaign area with my family who just recently moved there.  And they suggested that I try this buffet.  When I got there was amazed how good their food is.  It is far better than my regular buffet in Lansing.  If I ever return back to Champaign I will be going back, even though it is a little pricy."}
{"text":"Trust the reviews and stay away.    Staff is friendly but food is gross.  Went here with my boys (2,9,10) and they all said this place was gross and they Love Chinese food.  Even the 2 year old said \"yucky\" when he took a bite of his pizza."}
{"text":"Came here for Valentines Day when it was busy, and honestly the food was extremely fresh given that there were a lot of customers coming in and out. The sushi was the best part of this buffet, including rainbow rolls, spicy salmon, ahi tuna rolls, and California rolls, along with the BBQ Chicken Wings, Crab Rangoons, and made to order Rib Eye Steaks that are fresh never frozen.  Come here when it's busy, and you won't be disappointed!  There aren't much Asian buffets in Champaign, but this one made one of my favorites after visiting here for the first time. We expect to come back here every Sunday for our weekend dine-out meal. Keep up the great food!"}
{"text":"Not necessarily the best Chinese food in town, but it's pretty good, there is a large variety of things to eat, and the price is pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"Service: 3% F AWFUL AWFUL service! The first thing out of the lady's mouth was \"how do you want to pay\" (Nearly walked out right then and there, and I should have.) Every employee was playing around on their phones,  and it took like 10 minutes for them to even acknowledge that I was there.  (There where only 5 or 6 other costumers who where already eating.) A couple of guys even looked over at me, and just continued playing in their phones. If I where manager, I wouldve fired everyone.  Cleanliness: 33% F This place needs to be SHUT DOWN. Dust, grease,  and yes even dead bugs where on some of the tables! I didnt even dare go into a bathroom either.  Food: 11% Not fresh, flavorless, and gross. Gave me one heck of a stomach ache afterwards.   I would NOT recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"In general, I am not a fan of Chinese buffets. They start out amazing, but then as time goes on, they become a mess and the quality of their food turns sour. However, this is not the case with Chinatown Buffet. No, they are not amazing, but their food quality has been pretty consistent.   You can get a good selection of Chinese foods and be a patron of their mediocre sushi bar. You can also create your own stir fry or ask for a steak to be grilled for you. There's plenty of seating here and you generally know what you're coming here for -- quantity, not quality. If you have that as your mindset, you won't necessarily be disappointed.  Overall, Chinatown Buffet isn't bad. It's cheap and you get your fill."}
{"text":"Ok, just your typical cihinese buffet. Stop by for lunch on a saturday afternoon. With all the 4-star ratings I was expecting better. this is just average."}
{"text":"I have read the other reviews after I had started eating here. Some were pretty harsh and some are right on the money.  First things first, folks it's a BUFFET. When reviewing buffet places, you are not going to get a fancy 5 star restaurant experience. You are going to get many items to choose from at a set price. Which means that the place is going to have many dishes that are really cheap to make so they can make a profit. Yes, this place has crab legs and steak but at the same time, its not porterhouse steaks and king crab. The steak is really thin and seems to be more like over tenderized flat iron steak. As for the crab legs, they are from crabs but are not of the highest quality you would get at real seafood places.  They so carry sushi which is most of the time fresh, the only complaint I have against their sushi would be that sometimes it isn't kept as cold as it should be. As for most of their other dishes, they are okay. Rice is made and kept in a rice steamer, and the Lo Mein is really good. I usually have beef pepper steak on my Lo Mein and you can tell that the beef in this topping is not a prime choice cut of beef. Once again, I keep in mind that their dishes are going to be made as cheap as they can so the restaurant can make a profit.  As for the restaurant being clean, I usually see someone always sweeping under tables and wiping down the tables. My concern would be about their bathrooms, which never seem to be clean. Toilet paper on floor and their sink area seems to be failing apart.  Three stars out of five. One star off for their dirty bathrooms and one more for the overall quality of service. Overall, you get what you pay for. This place is a buffet, which means low quality food in mass quantity. It is what it is, if you want high end food then go down the street to high end restaurants where you will pay more than you pay here."}
{"text":"It was just ok. It was so close to my hotel, and I didn't feel like driving around. The sushi was eh, the food was eh. It's a huge ass buffet, almost too big. If they made it smaller, they could focus on making everything better. It's just your average Chinese buffet. You get what you pay for. I don't think I would go again."}
{"text":"It's a very nice restaurant clean and the service is friendly. The buffet itself is decent, there is a salad bar and dessert bar. And pretty much all the regulars you see at a chinese buffet. I tried the wonton soup which was adequate, lo Mein was good, fried dumplings, egg roll, sweet and sour chicken and potatoes everything was good. If you want a quick adequate chinese meal this is your spot."}
{"text":"I was looking for reviews and I saw how bad the general reviews for Chinatown were... it isn't bad!   It is a Chinese buffet!! They have a lot of sushi! and by diner they have steaks!!!  They have a wide range of things to eat and they are the one with the most variety in town."}
{"text":"terrible food ! if you care your money and time , dont even try ! i wish i did not stop by. terrible terrible food !!!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth the price! We paid 15$(included taxes and tips) definitely will go back there again."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Monday.  Food was below average, although there was variety.  Sushi was really not sushi, just vegetables, cheese and a little fish (or at least that is what it looked like, did not taste like it).  Found a dirty diaper in the lot and the inside was not the well kept and seats had rips in them.  I have eaten at the location for several iterations and it looks like the same seating that was there 20 years ago.  Much better options for Chinese (non buffet) in the CU area."}
{"text":"I was tricked in to going here for lunch by one co-worker who said to another 'we should go to that great Chinese place you like'.  Then we arrive and damn... it's a GD buffet!  Requisite deep-fried things, Mongolian BBQ (didn't try, but no scary smells and co-worker #1 didn't get sick after eating his) and sushi section (run of the mill buffet sushi, but I didn't touch anything raw).  Rows and rows of hot food plus a row just for salad bar (with OK veggies).    I loaded up on the sauteed green beans and pulled other cooked veggies out of various trays.  Not all of the chicken was breaded mystery meat - I liked the Black Pepper Chicken.  All in all, this was a decent Chinese buffet.  Don't get me wrong, I still felt like crap afterwards and needed a nap..."}
{"text":"As far as a buffet goes, Chinatown is one of the larger ones I've been to.  As I recall they had 6 buffet bars, with maybe 40 things to choose from.  They have your standard fare of various deep fried mystery meats, hidden in thick sauces to cover their low quality.  Finally, as you'd expect, they have a large desert and ice cream bar.  Interestingly though, they had a whole section where you could make your own bowl of food and have them cook it for you.  There were lots of veggies, meats, and various sauces to choose from.  Simply put everything in a bowl and the staff tosses it onto a huge grill, similar to places like Mongolian BBQ.  This might be your safest bet, as you know exactly what your eating.  I'll admit it, I'm not a huge buffet fan, so I'm a little biased.  I give it 3 stars based on size alone."}
{"text":"Why are you reading reviews of a buffet? There's not much to say. Chinatown is a Chinese buffet, and that's all you really need to know. There is a huge selection of foods, including a decent sushi bar, desert table, and a pretty good stir-fry grill. A few dishes are really good but the majority are just ok - but that's the point of a buffet, really."}
{"text":"Food was very good! Also very fresh!! The staff is somewhat rude. They are very short with you. We never got a refill on drinks. And every time the kitchen staff was out to check the food, you had to watch out where they were going. They could cut in front of you and stand right in the middle of everything like you are in the way. But good food! Large variety and stir fry!!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today. Haven't been here in awhile. Thought I'd stop in and see how or if it had changed at all.    The food was hot and fresh. They offer a good variety of options to choose from. The staff is great as always. The place is neat and clean. And not to mention it has awesome ambient music. Can't ask for anything more!"}
{"text":"While the price may be a little steep depending on your budget, I like the large selection and the food is good (relative to what you'd expect from a Chinese buffet). I just can't shake the substandard health standards the place provides...from the food, to the dishes, tables, etc. The manager is also extremely unprofessional and rude.  Do not recommend."}
{"text":"The worst buffet I've ever had. Not worth of the money. If you are looking for some gourmet Chinese food, don't go here. STAY AWAY OF THIS PLACE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good price for an abundance of food. I went there for their Christmas buffet. It's normally $12 which is a good price, but, without asking he only charged me $11 for the senior price, must be my grey hair. Thanks, sincerely. I also got a Lime Margarita, (I'm thinking the bar service is kind of new,) Quite tasty. They have a nice variety of food, which includes crab legs. Having to fight for the crab legs, I did manage to get my fill. I tried the frog legs, just to say I tried them, but did not try the pickled chicken feet. They have an attractive variety of sushi, but, I overheard it wasn't anything special. I stuffed myself, and will go back soon. There is no way you can try it all."}
{"text":"This place stinks! The service was lousy and food was below par.  The floors seemed to be sticky in some areas and wet in others which might cause an injury.  We went for dinner service and made a reservation for this place and was charge a reservation fee (not disclosed).    We had hot tea at our table and yet we were charged per cup.  If a single person orders tea, the customer would get a pot and a cup.  But we were charged 7 teas for only 2 pots and 7 cups.  A huge markup on tea!  Also, we were told that they ran out of hot tea (which was found to be untrue later on).  How hard is it to have boiling water and tea leaves?  We were told that the tea was made in a large pot made in the morning to be served throughout the day. So not fresh tea is served to customers.  When we complained and ask for the manager, a manager was not brought to our table and instead the staff was deciding who wanted to be \"the manager.\"  Large selection of food, ranging from sushi to stir fry.  The food was some warm at best and some of the sushi was not fresh.  I suggest doing the stir fry if you want a hot meal.  Finally, what was disgusting is the employees were wrapping napkins to the eating utensils after servicing guests and touching the fork and spoons heads without washing their hands.  This is unhygienic and extreme unprofessional.  If you want clean utensils, I suggest the disposable chopsticks or bring your own fork and spoon.  The only reason why this only given one star was that the ice cream machine misspelled \"swirl\" with \"swril\".  I had the \"swril\" =)  Please look elsewhere for Chinese food.  Your stomach will thank you and you will definitely have better service than this dump."}
{"text":"The best food I want to the a lot of the buffet restaurant this is the best place to eat and Great service"}
{"text":"Dirty inside and out. Bathrooms are in rough shape. Food was cold that should be hot. Don't risk a day in the bathroom from eating here."}
{"text":"Kinda just \"meh\". Nothing really fun about this place. Looks run down from the outside. They need to change the food selection up once in awhile. Go here about once every other month, but it's gotten quite boring. Nothing really special about this place. Would recommend you drive a few miles to KoFusion for something better for a little extra money."}
{"text":"It's my favorite place to eat other then the fact they rush you the whole time until your out and expect a tip ..like seriously first of all I'm not small I love to eat Chinese food an its rude to stand over someone and star an rush them like you have no sense"}
{"text":"Inedible noodles, canned fruit, underdone chicken... Avoid this place."}
{"text":"11.99 for Sunday dinner buffet. I did not see any nigiri sushi. All of their sushi is 1 piece of imitation crab and 1 piece of egg with either avocado, more imitation crab on the outside or tuna. The fish was not fresh. Sushi bar as seaweed salad. This place has a hibachi grill where you can make grilled shrimp or ask for a piece of steak. The steak was not flavorful, took a bite and tossed.  I made a noodle stir fry at the hibachi grill, this was my least favorite dish, no taste to the noodle, very poorly executed.  Decent fried rice OK lo mein. Good green beans, good mushrooms.  Terrible deserts, call the cakes were stale and rock hard. Worst egg tart I had in my life. Amazing egg drop soup, not sure what is in it, maybe overload of MSG. Either way, gets the job done and I definitely had two cups. They also have chicken soup here which I've never seen at any other chinese restaurant or buffet, did not look enticing enough to try. They have an ice cream machine here but my ice cream melted immediately after dispensed, too watery.  Good spring rolls and good crab ragoon. Overall, you will find something you like here because there were at least 7 isles of buffet plus 1 more sushi isle and a hibachi grill. Don't come here expecting anything more than what you can expect at any buffet and you will be fine."}
{"text":"I've always loved this place!   Been here too many times to count.   Great food, wonderful servers, and free ice cream with your meal.   This place is a tradition with my whole family."}
{"text":"I have had my fair share of Chinese buffet. This was definitely the worst among all. Over the last four years, I went to this restaurant four times at an approximate interval of one year. Each time I went there, I felt that the quality degraded compared to the previous time. This time I felt like puking. The food was gross, stale and full of soy sauce stench. Remember it's a buffet and I found not a single item to be edible. All of the food items seemed to be recycled from week-old leftovers. Horrible, slam dunk horrible. I would probably try to report this restaurant to the corresponding food inspector. Please avoid this restaurant at any cost for your own good."}
{"text":"Perfectly serviceable buffet, but probably not worth a trip if you're not in the area.  While the food is generally fresh, the selection isn't that large. It's a bit of a trek, but you're better of heading to Matthews for the Hibachi Grill for their selection - and if you have the time, go all the way to the new China Buffet in the converted Olive Garden at Albemarle Road (though that one is a real drive from here).  But if you're in the area, and don't mind the funky parking lot, they work out just fine - fairly standard buffet eats, fried and non-fried, as well as some dessert selections and they do a decent job of taking care of the items that you work through during your meal, and friendly to boot."}
{"text":"Good lo main chicken for a very good price. Prices are decent and food is like everywhere else. If someone is looking for a fancy Chinese than they have to go to a pfchang"}
{"text":"I give it three stars for size alone.   IMHO, the bigger the Chinese buffet, the better. You know what the food is gonna taste like (meh), you know how much you will eat (too much), and you know how it will make you feel afterward (like a meat turtle: http://thisiswhyyourefat.com/post/385824028/bacon-cheese-turtleburgers-ground-beef-pattie).   So, this place is huge. It has lots and lots of choices of crap Chinese fast food to eat. The food is not at all bad when compared to most crap Chinese fast food, but a fried turd is still a turd. Also, and this is the biggest highlight of the restaurant, they have a station where you can select ingredients for them to cook you in a wok, like at Flattop Grill. Their crab rangoons are pretty good. There is also a gift shop (WTF?) in case you want to relish your trip here forever. They will let you take some with you, though I never have. Expect to spend about $10 with a drink, a little less for lunch."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. The buffet is extremely limited, with 75% of the dishes being chicken of some sort. The General Tso's chicken was sickeningly sweet (when it is instead supposed to be spicy), the Hawaiian and Pepper Chicken were grisly. The sushi tasted as if it had been frozen and thawed. The Rangoon was tasty but mostly cheese and not much crab. The egg rolls somehow tasted burnt. Even the obviously premade cakes were somehow stale and hard. The only redeeming quality was the staff who were very nice and attentive. Will not return."}
{"text":"This is not the worst Chinese buffet I've ever been to.  And that's the best thing I can say about it."}
{"text":"As far as cleanliness, choices and prices, this place is really good for a buffet. Our waitress was very sweet as well. However, we brought a coupon that we printed out TODAY off of their website. We didn't see it had expired, and the manager argued with me. She kept saying, \"we won't honor the coupon. Print out the one that is updated on the website.\" THE ONE WE USED WAS THE ONE ON THE WEBSITE! She was so rude. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"As I expected--greasy, fried, quasi-Chinese-but-mostly-American food. Egg tarts good. Not worth experimenting though if you've never been here. I think there was seriously only one vegetable dish, and Chinese eat a lot of vegetables. So, it's that kind of \"chinese\" buffet."}
{"text":"-5  Worst food of my life...My son ate some chicken and threw up about 5 min later...the few things I tried (in the 5 min it took to come back on my son) were so sweet like they poured sugar on everything. Then I still had to pay for the 10 min we were there full price...The waitress didn't care put I didn't put up much of a fight just wanted to leave...I should've followed my first mind and never sat down"}
{"text":"Spring rolls and fried chicken are good and they have ice cream.  The rest of the food needs work."}
{"text":"Not the best Chinese in town, but I think my perception of this place is affected by circumstance. I've only come here when I'm craving Chinese, will be in the area, and am starving. Therefore, I appreciate the decent selection at a cheap price, and the bottomless crab rangoon and soft serve."}
{"text":"This is a o.k. Chinese buffet.  There is a large variety of food that seems standard at many Chinese buffets.  The food is good, when I went it seemed like there was good turnover so food wasn't sitting out too long.  There is a section of food that can be cooked over the grill, which is something that I haven't seen in other buffets in the area.  If you are looking for Chinese food, I would order take out.  If you want a buffet, then this can do."}
{"text":"Pretty good, even at 2:30 in the afternoon. There were fresh items being brought out to restock the steam tables. The usual staples of such things - beef and brocoli, battered chicken in a lemon sauce, lo mein noodles, fried rice and the like. As well, one bar dedicated to fried stuff, including french fries, onion rings, crab rangoon and spring rolls. I skipped that one.  Dessert bar had some fruit and cake that looked like it wasn't worth the effort, but they have to try, right?  Full meal, $6.99. $3 tip because the gal kept my water glass filled and cleared dirty plates quickly.  I thought it was pretty good. Better than most. I was especially pleased that it was this good between the lunch and dinner crowds."}
{"text":"The food was terrible. Over cooked and without taste (though the pepper steak had a strong flavor of freezer burn). I sampled two plates worth and only took one bite of each dish.   The place is filthy. After leaving I had to scrub the bottom of my shoes because of the sticky floors.   There were ants on our table.   The desserts were stale.   There was nothing redeeming about our experience, and after leaving two members of my family felt sick. Suffice to say we will never be returning."}
{"text":"Restaurant has a somewhat small buffet, but does offer an excellent selection. They have the BEST lo mein and fried rice! Not a huge fan of their crab rangoon (a little too much cream cheese) and their egg/spring rolls are just okay. I love their teriyaki chicken, general tso's chicken and their chinese donuts! It's well worth it for just $8 something a person, and you can also order takeout!"}
{"text":"Restaurant review: Another restaurants make the DNV list in Champaign. I was hungry and against my better judgement decided to go to this AYCE buffet for dinner. It was a weeknight so luckily there was no line. At first glance I was super excited by the variety of food offered here and 10.99 this is a lot cheaper than the sushi/asian seafood buffets up north. This is where Chinatown buffet took a sharp u-turn from other restaurants that at least feign cleanliness. I watched as they were preparing food from a white bucket on the floor by the grill. I have no idea what sort of food was being prepared, but it should neither be stored in a white unmarked bucket, in a unrefrigerated area, or anywhere near the floor. Let me tell you about the food I ate: 1. Sushi- yes they had salmon nigri. I was excited that there was 4 fresh pieces of it when I arrived and 4 other pieces of an unknown fish. I took the 2 pieces of salmon, not fatty at all very thin cut. Not cold either... I didn't think much until the end of the meal when I went back outside and the same 6 pieces were left. I guess other people were smarter than me. I also had a few pieces of the rolls. The fried roll was somehow ice cold and the one that had some sort of seafood rolled was warm. This is bad news 2. Chinese food crab rangoon okay nothing exciting with this, chicken okay nothing exciting 3. Crab legs- these should be exciting and super expensive, but for some weird reason they are dark colored and very dirty. Even the water that they were boiled in looked like no one washed the crab legs and the dirt or sediment was cooked with it. The meat was slightly firm, but not mushy which you would except with dead crabs 4. Clams- stir fried in black bean sauce. Okay but you always worry what quality is being served as they are a filter organism that can harbor hepatitis A, bacterial, etc. 5. Grilled \"ribeye\"- how would you like it done.. medium rare.. 5 minutes later I get a minute steak that when I cut into it, the meat is well well done. I eat it and go back for more because I like meat. Again same thing. It looks nothing like the steak in the pictures and I question whether this is really ribeye 6. More asian food egg rolls, salmon, green beans, and ribs. Most of this was over cooked and very greasy. Just check out the shininess in the pictures I took 7. Crawfish- another seafood item that looked good but not clean with dark dirt material. Ugh 9. Corn, fried chicken, chinese donut. Well you can't mess up these basic items so no complaints. 10. Dessert- The only POSITIVE thing was the red bean fried sesame balls. I ate 6 these were tasty. The brownie looked disgusting with the sprinkles losing color into the brownie. The peanut brittle was burnt and not edible. The soft serve ice cream is served without cones. It did not appear to melt as it sat on the table and the \"hot fudge\" that was used basically deflected off the ice cream. I have no idea what was in the fudge but it tasted very artificial.  There is a lot of other things I did not try including make your own stir fry, soups, etc. If you want quantity this is the place to go. Quality is way below acceptable levels both in quality or hygiene in my opinion.   FINALLY to make matters worse, at 3 AM I had rip roaring abdominal pain. No other symptoms so I don't know if something was not prepared well or just too greasy. I am glad this experience is over.  Pro: Run away  Cons: Poor hygiene, seafood that did not look clean, below average quality, you can get food poisoning especially based on there preparation of food  Hidden gem: Go to centralillinoissavings.com and print out coupons for lunch and dinner if you dare come here Lunch Buffet 6.99 Dinner Buffet 10.99 Weekend Buffet 11.99 Sunday Buffet 10.99 Soda 1.99"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed dinner here with my two older kids. Wonderful selection of food, there is something for everyone. My daughter loves sushi and she says it was delicious. I loved the freshly grilled steak, it was wonderfully flavored. My son loved everything. Lots of vegetable choices and I liked that almost everything is labeled and says if it is spicy. Sauteed green beans, broccoli chicken, pork buns, mushroom chicken, salmon, peanut chicken were some other favorites and the apple pie was good desert. The decor was beautiful and the staff were all very friendly. We will definitely become regular customers."}
