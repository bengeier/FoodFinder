{"text":"I've read a lot of negative reviews about Palate Bistro after going online following my own underwhelming experience there.

Cold soup and overcooked meat and fish seem to be this restaurant's trademarks. At least you can always get a table since it isn't packed like restaurants in the Strip or E. Carson St."}
{"text":"Went here after a nice evening at the Benedum. Just a quick walk from the theatre, we were excited to get inside where it was warm! The host staff was very friendly. We absolutely loved our table on the top floor. Mike, our waiter said that our table was his favorite in the entire restaurant. 

We were disappointed to find that there were no evening specials, but we were able to find good things on the menu. B.J. had the mussels and frites appetizer. The mussels were served in a white wine garlic, tomato and tarragon cream. He loved it! I had the french onion gratinee soup which was good. 

For my meal, I chose the Filet Mignon with hollandaise. It was wonderfully cooked and delicious. It was served with truffle potato puree and grilled asparagus. Everything was great. 

For dessert, we shared the s'mores.  It was super yummy and we both loved it.  Service was very attentive and we had a great time here."}
{"text":"I was here last night for the third time and sadly while it was acceptable the third time was not a charm.  I've had a different chef on every visit.  This place first garnered much buzz last summer/fall when the chef was Chef Racicot who is the brother of the other Chef Racicot at the AAA 5 diamond Lautrec at Nemacolin.  I was more than pleased the first time I ate here when this talented chef was at the helm.  Okay, I'll start with the good.  The space itself is beautiful.  It's ultra modern with high ceilings and warm lighting.  There is a nice bar upstairs with plenty of seating and a few large leather chairs for lounging.  The service was attentive if not overwhelming.   Tim was our main server and he was very nice, friendly, and had a decent familiarity with the menu able to give genuine opinions.  They validate the parking, which is a plus when having to drive to the city.  It's also a good thing to have a decent french restaurant in Pittsburgh, especially now that Cafe Allegro is closing after 22 years on Saturday.  Now, on to the food.  I started with the Mussels and Frites, which were mussels in a campbells tomato soup type broth.  The broth was okay, but heavier than I would have preferred and the mussels did not taste that fresh and had a somewhat unpleasant flavor.  I didn't finish the mussels.  The frittes were delicious.  I'm guessing double fried and fresh cut.  My friend ordered the calamari which was okay.  The creme fraiche dippping sauce was a nice change and the calamari was cooked well.  However, I feel they soaked it in a bit too much lemon.  Next I tried a chicken noodle soup.  It was very good.  The chicken was well seasoned.  The broth delicious and the noodles firm.  My only complaint was that it was served luke warm.  Finally, my entree was the hanger steak, which was delicious and probably my favorite thing I tried that evening.  It was cooked perfectly (medium) and was well flavored and a healthy portion.  The broccolini was the side and was rather unmemorable.  However, again the steak was quite good.  The current chef has been here for about six weeks and it's clear he has some talent.  However, there is definitely room for improvement.  Overall a good restaurant.  I also give it kudos for serving the full menu at the bar.  My hope is that this will become a very good restaurant someday soon."}
