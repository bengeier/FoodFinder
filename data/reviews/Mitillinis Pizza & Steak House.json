{"text":"I called earlier to ensure an order could be delivered. Was told yes - also had an order delivered to this address a week prior. Upon ordering, was told it would be 45 minutes. Not a big deal. Was then called back by a hostess saying the kitchen is refusing to drive to Sherwood (approx 15 minutes from the restaurant) due to \"being too far\" and that the delivery made a week prior was a \"mistake\". I was ordering for a \"celebration of life\" and reiterated that, in addition reminded the people I spoke with that I was told previously I could make an order. I was met with NO compassion and was told that if I complain I should say \"no one in the kitchen is willing to make my order\". This was coming from \"Mike\"... don't have any other information as he refused to give any other information. I have worked in customer service for over ten years and have NEVER experienced such a lack of respect. This was a celebration... shame on this establishment!!!!!! I was born and raised in silver springs and I have gone here for over 15 years and I WILL NEVER go back and will NEVER refer ANYONE after such a lack of customer service and compassion."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for take out pizza ever since our friends who live in the area told us how good it is.  That's 10 yrs now!  Their pizza is amazing!  Best we've found in Calgary.  The crust is not greasy!  Yay. ..it's good and chewy and has a hint of sweetness to it. Delicious!  This is a crust you don't leave on your plate.  Toppings have always been great.  We usually do a half and half bcuz I love pineapple and hubby doesn't.  We have never come across a hair in our food nor the box.  I'm sure that was a one time thing hopefully for the other commenter.  The cheese is fine. .never found it to be runny?  As previously stated.  Like I said if we want great tasting pizza this place has never let us down in our many times over 10 yrs!"}
{"text":"Had a delicious pizza dinner with the family here.  The pizza crust is really thick and covered with toppings.  My wife ordered a gluten-free ham and pineapple pizza and says it's the best gluten-free crust that she's had.  The kids meal was reasonably priced.   The atmosphere is kinda meh, but the service was fast, the restaurant warm (on a cold day) and the pizza delicious."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Silver Springs.I had a 9oz New York steak with soup to start and garlic toast as well as stuffed potato and vegetables all for under $19.You can't get a quality steak for that much anywhere else.The service was friendly, personable and very attentive, never missing a beat.We have been looking for a new place to get a great steak ( although this place has awesome pizza , chicken and pasta as well), and this restaurant definitely makes the grade.With quality food , service and super reasonable prices I think we may become regular customers."}
{"text":"OMG - do not go here! We were given a recommendation to try this place, we had never heard of it or had been in this area of Calgary much yet. Ordered at near closing time a half veggie-half hawaiian. The hostess left even before we did after we paid! They had a slow night and were trying to close for 9pm.I had a peek of the pizza in the car and I was STARVING. WELL there was no way I could lift a piece as the cheese was that runny kind - not good. Waited until we got home to dive in and try, What more can I tell you that after my 2nd piece I found a nasty hair lurking in the bottom of the box. EW, not nice. Disgusting. Repulsive. Anything nice that I could say about this pizza just went out the window at that point. Threw the rest out, end of story and waste of $20. A large pizza these days looks like a small. Nasty, nasty pizza and very expensive. I am very sorry to write this review as I wanted to like it, it is not a chain and these are the businesses that I want to support but there was no excuse for this experience and after the fact - not even worth calling them on it. Maybe the owners will see this review and consider hair/arm nets!"}
{"text":"We always order delivery pizza from here. The crust is light and always cooked to perfection.  Best place we have found so far that delivers to Tuscany.   Haven't tried anything else on the menu yet. Not much reason too.   Sunday pizza is half price when you dine-in."}
{"text":"Mitillini's is a favorite spot of mine. The food is always great, the atmosphere is comfortable, and the staff are friendly and prompt. In truth, I'm almost only ever here for their half-price pizza on Sunday, which is fantastic. If you're looking for Neapolitan pizza, try Pulcinella - my other favorite spot. But if you want a hearty, brimming to the crust pizza that's loaded with toppings you don't see on traditional pizza - read: a good old fashioned 'North American' pizza - Mitillini's is the place to go.   The crust is perfect - never burnt or undercooked - and their extensive menu has something to please everyone, from plain cheese to the House Special, trimmed with ham, pepperoni, green peppers, mushrooms, shrimp, tomatoes and black olives (I get mine with anchovies on the side). Note that the half-price pizza night is dine in only, with no reservations, and no half-and-half pizza. And you can't take your leftovers home, either, so choose wisely.   If you're looking for some tasty Italian, don't miss their $7.95 pasta special Monday to Wednesday, or their $8.95 steak and fries special on Thursday."}
{"text":"B - List. Family owned and operated. They try. Affordable family dining. Nothing to send you into orbit. Good people. Good service."}
{"text":"Pizza is very good. Nice, light, semi sweet crust. We've ordered takeout a number of times, and always been happy with the results."}
