{"text":"The food was so fresh and the naan was light and crispy. The staff was very friendly and polite. Will definitely ne returning."}
{"text":"Had the Sunday Buffett little bit of everything they  offer. Excellent food.  I tried almost all local Charlotte Indian places and this is by far the tastiest Indian place in my opinion."}
{"text":"The food is great and the owner is a very nice person! But the owner definitely needs to replace the host/cashier; one of the most unpleasant hosts I've ever seen. He never greets people with smile, barely ever says 'Thank you' to customers during check out; and guess what, never offers any services to the customers who are being seated; initially, I didn't even know where to find some drinks or a glass of water. During the buffet, the guy stands behind the register doing nothing while plates are piling up on tables. I love the food there but sometimes I just feel like I wouldn't go because of the service."}
{"text":"Been home from India for a few weeks now and was very much in need of some SPICE and FLAVOR.  Boy did I get my wish!!!  The food is wonderfully made. Just the right amount of heat and a ton of flavor.  Highly Recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I had the best Pakistani food today at Zafran in Harrisburg. The food was very yummy and delicious. Very nice service."}
{"text":"What a disappointment... like many others, I was excited to see Harrisburg try to improve its cultural restaurant scene with an Indian/Pakistani restaurant, but unfortunately it seems this place won't be part of the scene for long. 

We visited Zafran around 8pm on a weeknight. There was only 1 other table occupied when we arrived. We helped ourselves to a table and a host gave us menus and glasses of water. Then the service went downhill from there. We sat and waited 15 minutes for the server to come take our order. As we waited, we watched 2 other families come in, get seated and waited on before us. Another gentleman (not the host who gave us our menus and water) finally came to our table and didn't even say hello; he just stood there with his pen and pad waiting for us to speak. We ordered the assorted family Kabob plate and garlic naan. He took our menus and walked away. We then waited over 50 minutes for our food. 50! As we waited, we watched the server attend to the 3 other tables, as they were served their food and even dessert! 

We strongly considered leaving after about 30 minutes, but as to not be rude, we sat there patiently waiting. Not one time in nearly an hour did he come by to check on us, refill water or apologize for the delay. We were finally brought our food and for what it's worth, it was good. Nothing I'd write home about (I'm a huge fan of Indian, Pakistani and Afghan food and have had some exquisite food elsewhere) but it was authentic and flavorful.

Once again, as we ate, the server never once came by to check in, nor fill our glasses which were now empty. Even after we finished eating, I had to get up and stand by the cash register, waiting for him to acknowledge us. He finally came, didn't say a word, swiped my card and walked away. I had to help myself to a bag and box for our left-overs before we walked out. What a horrible dining experience it was. 

As mentioned, the food was good, so if you're looking for a quick grab-and-go for lunch without dining in, it would probably suffice, but service as horrendous as this will simply drive customers away. I've received better service in a drive-thru, so I'd suggest ownership looks to drastically improve the service and friendliness of the waitstaff and hosts, or this place (especially given its sub-par location) will be out of business quickly."}
{"text":"Worst service as they also running out of items. If you order anything the answer is always this over take this instead. Just not worth it. Feels like they do not care about their menu and it's just for the sake of it."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite Indian food in the area!  Harrisburg is lacking in the restaurant department so I'm super excited to have variety and quality move in :).  If you like chicken tikka masala, it's the best you'll ever have.  And if you're adventurous, it's the right place to go because they're authentic and perfectly prepared.  I also greatly appreciated the amazing attitude and enthusiasm when even picking up to go orders :).  Always looking forward to eating here!!!"}
{"text":"Chicken Haleem is awesome.  Tastes like chkn n gravy. 

Lamb seekh kabab is good and kind of like a good meatloaf.  I liked putting it inside a piece 
of garlic naan.  

Afghani rice was a little plain n a little sweet with carrots n golden raisins.   Was very good with the haleem ( but it came with the lamb)

My husband felt the same as all above.  Great 

Garlic naan is awesome too. 

I think it was the owner or manager taking everyone's order. Very helpful with dish descriptions.  Laughing with people at times. 

Great first try."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Omg. The kebab platter, the chapli kebab, the rotis!!! Every single item I have had here has been so so so good. The people here are so friendly, great service! I have been here at least 5 times and the food and service has been awesome! I would definitely recommend this place for any one looking for some great Pakistani or Indian food!"}
{"text":"This is a no frills restaurants as mentioned by fellow reviewers and i really liked the food, we ordered mix grill and kadai chicken which was by far the best i have tasted in Charlotte. I would suggest to go for the sheek kabob as it is the best out of the mixgrill. The other two kabobs in mix grill could have been better. The peshawari naan and chili naan was best among the naans that i tried.Ambience could have been better. Nevertheless good food."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've had in Charlotte!! I never usually write reviews, but this place deserves it! Fresh off the grill kebabs, Lamb Karahi was full of flavor and the naan's are soft and hot! If you are looking for authentic Indian/Pakistani food, this is definitely the place to go!"}
{"text":"Finally some authentic north Indian/Pakistani food..Tried beef nihari, mutton korma, butter chicken , mutton biriyani and Peshawari naan and all of them turned out to be delicious..if the Garam masala is a touch lesser in the biriyani I believe it will taste even better..
Haven't yet tried the buffet but I guess the variety will justify the price which I guess is a little on the higher end on the first sight.."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews but I need to give this place 5 stars for sure. This place is a heaven for chicken tandoori lovers. I haven't had better grilled chicken tandoori and biryani than this place. There buffet is worth the price with a lot of options. The only thing I would say is that there isn't a lot of options for veggies out there but the owners is always kind enough to add something special if there's a veggie in the house as well. I would Definitely recommend this place to anyone craving for good authentic Indian/Pakistani food."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy authentic Pakistani - Indian foods! Hospitable staff and delicious options both on the buffet and menu! Great addition to the Harrisburg community, looking forward to enjoying it for years to come!"}
{"text":"If you love Indian food you will love this place!  The food is authentic and extremely tasty. The owner provided excellent service and offered many recommendations. This was my first visit and it will not be my last.  The naan was amazing."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh ingredients, with great friendly owners. Lamb kebab and goat dish were fantastic."}
{"text":"It was an amazing experience of authentic Indian/Pakistani food. The food was delicious and the staff was very polite and they did serve us even after the closing time. The mango lassi was amazing as a dessert. I would highly recommend it and will make sure I visit again before going back to Tennessee, where I am from. I wish these guys good luck for the future and hope the continue the taste and customer service."}
{"text":"I went to the buffet hours around noon, everything was warm and delicious. I have eaten at a lot of Indian restuarnets so the quality of food here is way better than the ones near the university area - for sure. My only setback is the price, the buffet is overpriced for the variety of food you're getting. It makes it hard for most college students to afford this place, so with that being said I probably won't be coming back very often due to the price. But overall the atmosphere is super friendly and clean."}
{"text":"The food is delicious!  I love the kababs. 
I think my favorite so far is chicken achari,  but I haven't been there enough yet to have tried most of the other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a Tuesday. Really wanted some Biryani but the buffet looked too good so I went for it. Good choice  everything was delicious and the bread was perfect. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great new Indian restaurant in Harrisburg! Lunch buffet is 12.99. A little expensive but worth it!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Pakistani food we have had around! If you like Indian cuisine you need to come here! Family run and the naan is to die for! Spicy plates full of flavor. Thank you guys for being here!"}
{"text":"The mixed plate for two is amazing and feeds almost 3 people. We just had it for the first time and I we will definitely continue to get it. This place is very authentic."}
{"text":"I am giving 1 start because I felt been cheated . 
I went yesterday for Buffet and i have been charged $16 extra . 
1st of all the cashier never have me the receipt so I have to request for one. After looking at my bill I asked about the $15 + $1 charged and I have told that $15 Is gratuity but that should only be added if you have more then 6 people or having a party . 
We were only 4 adults and 2 child's under 3. 
And this is not the 1st time they charged me extra , I did noticed that before as well but didn't asked for the detailed receipt but at this time I did."}
{"text":"Love the food from this restaurant but not crazy about the service. 

At lunch time you can only order the buffet. We are not huge fans of buffet for many reasons but it does give you an opportunity to try a variety of dishes. We went once and choose to go for dinner instead. 

We order the lamb kebabs, mixed grill, zafran chicken, Chana masala (chick peas).  All are excellent and craveable!!!   My favorite is the zafran chicken which is #56.  It is lightly fried, spicy, tender and delicious! The Chana masala is the best I have ever had...I don't make it anymore, I order from This restaurant.  Oh and the naan...awesome!!!

Con:  they need experienced servers and it takes a bit of time to prepare but worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"We always look for Indian restaurants to stop when we're driving. This one may become a destination stop...and its an hour from where we live. The food was amazing!!  Everything!!  And the service. These are the nicest, most welcoming people!  We felt right at home from the moment we entered."}
{"text":"Tried the buffet today and loved every single time in the buffet.100% Authentic Pakistani tatse. We highly recommend this place, do check it out if youre looking for authentic desi tatse."}
{"text":"After hearing so many great things about Zafran, I was looking forward to trying them since this location is not far from my side of town.  I visited this location during the week but I called my order in since I had a few questions about some of the menu items.  Once I arrived I was greeted by an older gentleman that I believe is one of the owners, he was very sweet and offered a few samples for me to try off of their dinner buffet while I waited for my to go order.  I didn't realize they had a buffet but I will keep that in mind for my next visit.  This location is not very spacious, especially with the buffet so it was a little tight around the buffet area.  I was able to sample the biryani, tandoor chicken and a dessert.  All just ok.

I ordered the samosas, chicken kabab, tikka masala, daal tadka, peshawaree naan, and regular naan.  The samosas were pretty good, crispy and fresh.  The chicken kabab is ground chicken not boneless and I was not a fan, not flavorful just bland.  The tikka masala was also very bland and greasy.  Both naan were plain and lacked flavor which was very disappointing.  When I placed my order for the daal tadka I wanted to make sure that it was not spicy and I was told it was not, however it was too spicy for me to enjoy which made me sad because it was the only thing that I really liked but it was just too hot.  I would like to think that I would return because the staff was so welcoming but the food was such a disappointment."}
{"text":"Went to the weekend buffet. The selection wasn't as large as some other places, but the quality of the food more than made up for that. All of the chicken dishes were SO tender and the veggies fresh and savory. I got to try a dish or two that I've never had along with some old standbys like tikka masala. The restaurant was very clean! All around a great experience."}
{"text":"Finally got here. Wish I had earlier. Got the mixed grill - just amazing. Plenty of food and tasted wonderful. Perfect amount of spice. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome, just plain awesome. Sometimes the food at a place is so good, I don't feel as though my review can give it justice. This is such a case. Let me start out by saying if you are a fan of Indian/Pakistani cuisine, you HAVE to check this place out.
Not only was my food delicious but it was an educational experience. I have been to several Indian restaurants and have come to love the food. I have never tried Pakistani food and didn't know the difference. Both of the gentlemen that I spoke to at Zafran talked to me about the main differences and how their food differs from the others I have tried.
I noticed that the special was called goat hareem. I'm a big fan of goat and lamb so I knew that I wanted to give that a shot. I was not disappointed. So incredibly yummy. The garlic naan was fantastic as well.  It arrived uncut and covered in garlic. So good. I can't wait to go back and try something new and spicier!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for truly authentic Pakistani food in Charlotte, look no further than Zafran. This establishment offers consistently fresh and tasty South Asian cuisine at a reasonable cost. I've been here several times with family and friends and have never been disappointed. 

I recommend the nihari, chicken 65, butter chicken, and mixed grill platter."}
{"text":"We live in Harrisburg and love Zafran. Food is amazing!!! Make sure you get the garlic naan and vegetable samosas with all your meals!!!"}
{"text":"Had achari mutton, chicken tikka masala ..both dishes were awesome .. there was a mixup with order but owner was really nice and immediately fixed the issue .. chicken biryani was delicious .. and the garlic naan was outstanding .. both the brothers who runs the place are very nice to talk to .. my daughter threw rice plate on the floor by mistake, they immediately came for rescue and helped .. i got lil embarrased but these guys were very nice .. i am really impressed with food and service .. do not miss out on this place .. vll be back for sure .."}
{"text":"Randomly ordered take out from here one night and I ordered the Daal Tadka and it was so good! Everyone else liked their food as well. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We order take out a lot, but their Sunday buffet is where it's at. Everything we've had has been delicious but some favorites are the lamb kabobs, palak paneer and tikki masala."}
{"text":"I never leave reviews I just creep around reading everyone else's but with this place I had to. They are SO nice they have customer service DOWN PACK! Then to too things off the food is amazing it's must!"}
{"text":"Food is okay,  too much oil.

Service is okay, they tend to pay more attention to regular customers, like handing naan to them on the table. Its rude, either you do it for everyone or none. Very expensive!"}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of Indian food, so when my husband brought home my chicken tikka masala I thought it would just be an ok dinner. To my surprise the chicken has become my favorite meal ever! I was actually upset when I finished it! I am so glad we found this place!! Definitely a MUST try!"}
{"text":"First time visit with friend for dinner.  Menu is huge, our server made excellent recommendations, everything was delicious!  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"We were very impressed, especially since this place is in the middle of Harrisburg North Carolina, not a town I would think would have a wide variety of yummy healthy food. But that's what it is at this restaurant. Also the owner is very nice and was very accommodating to my children not all of whom wanted typical Indian/Pakistani fare. Of course all kids like the white rice and the naan -, but the owner was kind and brought out a couple of things that were not spicy and more basic and my children love that. Although after tasting some of the other dishes half of the kids I was with ended up loving tikka masala and chicken baryani. The food here is prepared very deliciously with fresh ingredients. Also the staff is very nice. Also the price is amazingly low in my opinion. We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing staff!  I look forward to returning here and bringing my family.  The seasonings were perfect--not too much and not too little.  And the cashier was very friendly.  I am so glad Harrisburg has a new gem!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! The naan bread was baked to perfection! And the staff was incredibly welcoming, hospitable, and attentive. I would absolutely recommend Zafran to anyone looking for Halal in Harrisburg. Next time, I look forward to sitting on the lovely outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place rocks. We were having a hard time finding good indian/pakistani food in Charlotte...it's not a town with a lot of alternative cultures.
But, now we found it!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  We had the chicken and fish karahi, chicken kabobs and naan.  The food was excellent.  It is the Best chicken karahi I have had since moving from dc.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We are so excited that Harrisburg is finally getting some culture.  If you want authentic Indian food this is your place.    The staff is very friendly, the food arrived very quickly and was unbelievably good.   We will Be back again!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted to try something new and I had heard a ton of people who really enjoyed this restaurant.  We made it over for lunch and we're some of only people there because it was later for lunch.  

They had both the buffet and the menu available, and the man working was super helpful!  He explained what everything was on the buffet and also brought us fresh naan to the table.

I have had Pakistani food before but the Indian flare was new to me.  Many of the dishes were very good- not totally my thing, but I'm happy I tried it!  If you do like this type of food I'd highly recommend.  Lunch is 9.99 for adults, kids 11 and under 1/2 price.  Kids under 6 free i believe!  Not sure what kids can eat unless they are into spicy- my son (1.5) was with me and had tikka masala and naan and loved it!

Definitely a different addition to The Burg and the Town Center."}
{"text":"5 star buffet at lunch from Tue - Sun. Everything is fresh and delicious. I highly recommend it if you like Pakistani and Indian foods."}
{"text":"We stopped by during the lunch buffet which gave us a chance to try a variety of options, great since we aren't familiar with Pakistani food. The owner was very helpful as he walked us around the buffet bar describing and recommending dishes to us. 

My favorite was the grilled kebab meats, the mutton and the rice pudding was amazing. Was not a big fan of the chicken tikka masala and the naan was too dry, maybe just sat out too long. 

Overall we had a good meal here. I didn't find the buffet to be any more expensive than other Indian buffets around Charlotte."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and love Indian/Pakistan food and this place blew our socks off! The warm blend of spices used in their dishes will touch your very soul. They have only been open 8 months and if you have an appreciation for international cuisine you must give this place a try."}
{"text":"Best kabobs ever. You must have to get the kabob platter. Glad to have at least one authentic Indian food place, not like other restaurants where every single item taste same lol."}
{"text":"Best authentic Pakistani restaurant in town. Highly recommend to try this restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with few friends over the weekend and we had a great experience here. This is a Indo-Pakistani restaurant so they have variety of different food but mostly set of Pakistani food with mix of Punjabi.

If you are a fan of lamb kebab or lamb meat in general, this is the place for you. My friends were really raving about their taste on meat. Obviously we took the buffet so the taste is little mild but think about it, if their buffet was this good, how awesome it would be if you order with your custom taste?  

The folks at the counter were friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend this place to all the meat lovers out there. There isn't a whole lot of options for vegetarians here but if you are smart you will get it just by reading the name of this place, keyword = Kabab"}
{"text":"This place was suggested by some friends.
We drove almost an hour for dinner!!
The food and service was fantastic.
We enjoyed the authentic taste and flavor of the Goat Korma and Beef seekh Kabab 
The nan was excellent too.
Will definitely visit them again and again.
I wish they don't charge for the water as I drink a lot of water when eating !!
Otherwise 5 Star.

{"text":"It's tucked away from the main drag, however, for Northern Indian/Pakistani food, I don't think there is a better place than Zafran! Working nearby and being able to walk is super convenient for me, but even if that weren't the case, I'd still make the time to get to Zafran.

The owner is a super nice guy, and the lunch buffet is delicious. The only thing I'm ever left desiring is that the buffet had more items on it, however, anytime I've been there, every item on the buffet has been delicious!

If you like flavorful Indian food, and haven't been to Zafran Kabob Palace, you are robbing yourself of one of life's simple pleasures! Get to Zafran Kabob Palace especially for the lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"Amazing food as always. First time at this location, but food was held to high standards. I have to say i loved the kabab at this location a lot better. And naan was delicious as well, freshly baked hot out of the oven, mouthwatering. Compliments to chef for making it mild and still keeping it delicious. Amazing Service as well."}
{"text":"We found this place by accident and decided to try it based on the reviews and it was delicious! Ask the server what they recommend- you won't be disappointed. Authentic, fresh, and the chai is the best I've had in the Charlotte Metro area. Also - they have Uber Delivery if you live in the area. Thank you for a great dinner!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem!!!! Authentic!!!! The food was amazing. Tons of selection. Tons of flavor. A treat.  The service by Asaad and Haan was exceptional. We were surprised to find this gem in Harrisburg.  I would recommend this place all day long."}
{"text":"Having Indian friends I've been to plenty of Indian restaurants in Charlotte and New York . But I must say this one top them, all including the one in pineville by the same name. They food taste fresh hot and delicious. This will be my new spot for India/pakistaní cuisine. I definitely recommend this place you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The only reason why I go to this place is for Pakistani nihari . That's my favorite and they really make that amazing . There seating is decent and they have a good varities of buffet . Highly recommended. 

Prices are reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Lovely authentic Pakistani & Indian food. Went here for their lunch buffet the other day with a friend to try it out after seeing all the good reviews and I have to say, we weren't disappointed! 

The hosts were very friendly and the food was fresh (we saw them come out to change the main dishes at least once in the 30-45 min we were there, and the naan bread & dumplings [they weren't actually dumplings, more like battered and deep fried bits of spiced vegetable that were *DELICIOUS*] more than 3 times as they were flying off the buffet. 

It was all very tasty and I will have to go back for dinner soon! 

Would definitely reccomend."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place has been open for over a year and I didn't know about it! I am Pakistani and I know authentic Pakistani food and let me tell you, this restaurant is as authentic as it gets!! I am so incredibly happy I found it today and I will be returning back many times and bringing all my friends. The food is incredibly delicious and the naan is beyond perfection! Just like mom's food! I feel at home."}
{"text":"We were looking for a classic Indian restaurant on Yelp and saw this place not far away. We arrived and learned it was Pakistani/Afghani. They do not sell alcohol but that did not matter. The food was outstanding. Spicy but not hot. We ordered several items to share and everything was perfect, especially the naan and the Afghani rice. I will be back."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I'm a VERY picky eater, so I was hesitant about the dinner choice for my girls night out  with Diana Saavedra-Bryan and Natasha. We had dinner at Zafran tonight and it was DELICIOUS!! Told our waiter I had never eaten pakistaní food, and he offered some suggestions. We ordered the Zafran Mix Grill, Chicken Tikka Masala, Zeera Rice, a garlic/chili naan and a regular naan. OMG!! The meat was fresh and tender, the naan was fluffy and soft, and my favorite was the Tandoori chicken. Tasted like Mexican chicken adobo. Yummy!! The staff was attentive and courteous.  Sat there and chatted for a couple of hours after we finished dinner, and we weren't rushed or hovered over. Mr Khan, the owner, even came over and spoke to us. If you haven't tried this place, it's a must!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Grill for 2 is delicious. Fresh food. I will come back for the buffet."}
{"text":"I went for dinner and found the food delicious. The staff were very polite, the place was clean and inviting and the options were great. This is definitely worth the visit and is not your standard Indian restaurant. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious! The owner is very welcoming and accommodating as well. Would recommend to anyone craving Middle Eastern food!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, excellent service. Very kind people serving excellent food in a family friendly environment. Will go again and wholeheartedly recommend."}
{"text":"AWESOME! Stopped in on a whim after seeing the awesome reviews, and couldn't be happier that we did. Our server was very kind, attentive, and helpful, explained any dish we had questions on, and even let my sister taste test her food before finishing everything so it wouldn't be too spicy. We will definitely be back for the buffet on Saturday! If you like authentic Indian food, CHECK IT OUT! :$"}
{"text":"Always have a good variety of different dishes in the lunch buffet.  Fantastic mix of Indian and Pakistani food. The Naan is always baked fresh and the staff are always very friendly.  Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Small and no frills but absolutely delicious!!!

I walked into this place not knowing what to expect and was pointed to take any table I wanted. I chose one and sat down expecting for the typical silverware and napkin to be brought and to be asked my drink order. This does not happen here as it is completely self serve, but there was no offense that I was not aware of that. The gentleman told me to help myself and I requested a glass of water to drink, to which he gladly obliged. Only later, after I observed regular patrons, did I learn that even the water is self serve by grabbing a pitcher off a nearby tray.

The buffet is smaller than some nearby competing Indian buffets (while this is a Pakistani restaurant, the cuisine is similar since most of the Charlotte area Indian restaurants serve North Indian food), but the quality and taste of the food is much higher.

There were several chicken, goat, and vegetarian dishes including Chicken Tikka Masala, Goat Curry, Pakora, and one of my favourites: Channa Masala! 

One of my problems with several of the competitors in the area is that they are clearly catering to the \"local\" palate and are too afraid to spice up their dishes. While the food here wasn't up to the level of heat that I would order a personal dish, it definitely put a thin film of sweat on my brow and was much appreciated!

The television runs on an Arabic speaking Pakistani channel (sound muted) and there are a lot of patrons that wear hijabs and abayas, so if you are Islamaphobic, this might not be the place for you.

However, if you are looking for a delicious and well priced \"Indian\" buffet outside of Charlotte City limits, this is your place!"}
{"text":"This place has gone terribly wrong on it's food quality so as the service. We were regular to this restaurant, I had to update my previous review which I gave earlier this year. Me and my wife went there for dinner and ordered Mutton Biryani and Chicken Korma with naan bread. Korma and naan was ok to eat but the Biryani was really bad. It taste like chewing gum, the mutton was old which was microwaved and placed in the biryani. I have attached picture in this post as well. If you don't know the taste of the food also you can tell the food was not fresh, I mentioned this to the waiter and he agreed that it was cooked this morning and it has be microwaved.
I talked to the owner and wanted to give my honest feedback but he sound so stubborn, he told me that the food was top of the world and very fresh. 

Please try to avoid this place if you can, there are plenty of good option near university area or in south Charlotte."}
{"text":"Friendly wait staff, delicious food and super convenient to home. I ordered the Chicken Kabab and my mom had the Lamb Kabab - both were excellent but I think I would order the Lamb Kabab for myself next time (grass is always greener, right??). It looks like they have a buffet you could take per-pound to go as well for lunch so would be great for a quick grab on the lunch rush. Thanks for a great, easy and unique meal!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Pakistani and Pashtun cuisine with lots of yummy dishes- mutton biryani was delicious as was chicken tikka. Their naan bread is very fluffy and fresh!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place based on reviews and decided to visit for Saturday lunch buffet.  Service, non-existent, rice overcooked and hard, Panner tasted old, only one kebab was available.  This joint was overpriced to begin with and then they also charged me an extra $4 for chai tea which was on the buffet line.  Kabab Palace, methinks not.  Do yourself a favor and go somewhere with better service and selection like Passage to India or Peacock."}
{"text":"Fabulous food!!  We went to the Saturday buffet. Great selection.  Friendly management discussed dishes with us regarding spice and such. Indian/Pakistani food at its best!"}
{"text":"Great service. Have never had this type of food before.  They server answered all of our questions and helped us make yummy selections"}
{"text":"We love the weekend buffet. Get there on the earlier side for best selection. Great mix of traditional Indian dishes and Pakistani food. The kebabs and tandoori chicken are amazing. We've ordered the mixed grill off of the menu before and it was so good. Very friendly staff and owners."}
{"text":"Not only was the food delicious but the owners could not have been any nicer. It was our first time there and they were so helpful with suggestions. Everything we had, we loved!! Go, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I only ate there once, and it is because the service was terrible the food was terrible. The meat was very dry, the rice was very dry, and things that they said we're not spicy turned out to be very spicy. We got our rice a half an hour after we got our meat, and had to ask for it."}
{"text":"My family ate here this evening and the food was excellent. If you're not familiar with the cuisine, the staff is more than willing to offer suggestions and explanations of the items. There is a wide variety of food on the menu, so regardless of your palate you will be able to find something delicious. We ordered the Zafran Mix Grill (for 2 people) which is a good sampler of five different dishes. We ordered the Chicken Malai Boti for our kids. They were a little skeptical until their plates arrived, but proceeded to devour their dinners. We will definitely be returning customers."}
{"text":"Ordered the Zafran mixed grill - such a great opition when you want to try all the different kinds of meats. 3 adults and 1 toddler couldn't finish it. Meats were great, the lamb was my favorite. But my favorite was the white sauce, had to asked for it atleast 3x for more, literally licking it out of the bowl each time."}
{"text":"The hubby and I came to Charlotte from California for a training class. Been here for 4 days and we were looking for Pakistani food for days. So we decided to try this restaurant. I ordered takeout online on yelp the chicken mixed signature plate, some garlic naan, and some lassi. Food was still warm when we went to pick it up. And smelled amazing! We enjoyed the chicken tikka the most! Would totally recommend this restaurant to my fellow Pakistanis."}
{"text":"Amazing new location to compliment the other. Much closer to home and the same, actually even better service and taste! Ordered the grilled platter with Afghan rice and it was amazing ! Very fresh and plenty for 5 people. Recommend this place to be the best in the area !"}
{"text":"I finally stopped in tonight for dinner. The food here is superb! The flavor is wonderful and they don't spare the heat. So many restaurants in this area time things down and it just ruins the flavor and experience. Not the case with Zafran! I can't believe this place is in Harrisburg and so close to me. I'm looking forward to going back during the buffet hours so I can try more things. The owner stopped by to say hello and hoped we enjoyed the food and he even opened the door for us when we left.  I wanted to give them 5 stars based on the food and hospitality, but I had to subtract a star for the ambiance. The quality of food and price just doesn't fit the scenery. I would only subtract a half star if I could. It's really not a big deal and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Chicken 65 is awesome! Chicken kebabs on skews on rice- Amazing! Mango lassi-Delicious! They have another location in pineville with the exact same menu! Great service too! Owner is very friendly and helpful. Will come back and try more on the menu!"}
{"text":"The food was very delicious, and very authentic. I came a little bit after the lunch hour so the variety wasn't as much. But all-in-all will definitely return"}
{"text":"In Concord for Carolina Rebellion and saw this place on here so made the 10 minute drive out to check it out, very glad we did. Very authentic feeling place, very clean. Awesome mango drink. Got the Zafran platter for 2 and it was out of this world, me and my girl loved it. Everything was super hot and fresh, the naan bread was freakin killer. Also, the two men who were hosting and serving were very attentive and polite. This place rocks and I WILL be back next time I'm in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Trust me when I say I have never given a 5 star in any of my other reviews. I have always found faults with either the service or food. 

After going through a lot of reviews for this restaurant, I was enticed to see for myself what they are all about. So I was very happy when my roommate suggested we come here for dinner. 

Let's start with the review now. ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!!! The hospitality, the service, the quality and taste of the food - EVERYTHING!! What we had - Chicken Haleem, Garlic Naan, Chicken Kadai, Malai Boti Kabab and Mutton Biryani. Delicious, tender And scrumptious pieces, and perfect quantity of food. Very authentic food!! The owner and his sons are very nice and decent who give importance to every customer. Loved the food and the service. Will definitely recommend to friends and keep visiting them. Unfortunately was in a hurry and was not able to take any pics and post!! Will definitely make sure to do that next time I visit them."}
{"text":"Super yummy food! Wish I took a photo before I ate it all!! Staff was great and it was VERY clean! The aroma walking in made it hard to wait for our food, but it was worth it! Everyone needs to eat here"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the last two weeks, and have thoroughly enjoyed the buffet and friendly staff.  They have a good selection of both meat and vegetarian dishes.  The rice and naan are also delicious.  I would highly recommend to anyone who has a taste for Pakistani or Indian food.  This is a great value."}
