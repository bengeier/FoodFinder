{"text":"Absolutely horrible food and the worst customer service I have ever experienced.  My food was absolutely horrible. I ordered the cat fish with hash browns and the salad bar.   1St the salad bar was gross everything was brown and withered. The ice that was supposed to be in the salad bar to keep the food cold and fresh was water. But I didn't complain about that. Ha  2nd when I received my food the cook slapped two sliced of American cheese on top of my hash browns. Processed cheese disgusting but it was only melted where it stuck to my hash browns so I couldn't remove it but hard on the top.  The cat fish was so fishy you could smell how bad it was going to taste.  So I took one bite of my fish and two bites of my hash browns.  I could no longer eat it let alone have it on my table. My fiance told the server about my food and she told us she would have to talk to the manager. She came back to tell us that the manager Lindsey said because I took one bite of my fish and two bites of my hash browns that she could only take half off of the ordinary price. I was so shocked to hear this.  They didn't apologize for the food or the experience but put blame on the customer. So then the bartender came to my table pulled up and chair and pretty much put the blame on me for not liking their food.  She said, \"well you did order it and it's not our fault you don't like the food. She said, \" I don't know if it's because it's Monday and the batter was not freshly prepare, but that could be the reason why the fish tasted fishy\". Oh my goodness this woman was delusional. I couldn't believe the service we had. I couldn't believe we left 1855 to come to The Black Bear inn. Then the bartender had the nerve to discuss it with someone else in the bar area loud enough so we could hear it. She was very rude,  uneducated, with horrible customer service. My family went to the car and I stayed to thank the server, because it was not her fault our food was not edible and she did not contribute to the terrible customer service, she was only being lead by unprofessional leaders that have NO business in the restaurant industry let alone interacting with people.  WE WILL NEVER COME BACK!!"}
{"text":"Good place to go for your standard American cuisine. Don't expect to be amazed but do expect good food, good bar food, that is."}
{"text":"Fun place to hangout drink play shoes volleyball darts or poker. Plus they have cold beer"}
{"text":"Great place for fish, prime rib or just a burger. Salad bar is always fresh and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"We stopped over the weekend for lunch. Both had a sandwich and some chilli. The food was acceptable. As with other posts service was a little slow. We sat at the bar and noticed how dirty it was behind the bar. Ice machine vent was full of dust and the floor was disgusting with dirt that has been there for a long time. The place needs a good cleaning."}
{"text":"Visited the Inn for lunch with a friend a couple of weeks ago now. We ordered their sweet potato fries, and I had a chicken wrap, both of which were delish. Decent prices too (around $5 for the fries, around $7 for the wrap). Friendly service as well.   SO why only 3 stars? Well, unfortunately, I ordered a Fat Tire, and it definitely tasted off...so their taps need to be cleaned. Another downgrade is the decor, which could use some updating. Also, their specials were not super-clearly explained, and could be placed more prominently somewhere in the restaurant (like those table tents or something?)."}
{"text":"The prime rib breakfast special is great. It is only served Sunday till it runs out though.I prefer my hash browns crunchy and they were perfect today."}
{"text":"This was hands down easily the worst resturaunt i have been to in years.  1st off the service was terrible. We had to ask in the time span of 20 minutes for drinks. All the waiters and waitresses were very young and unprofessional.   Food took forever to get to the table. I asked for a half baked and half fried cod platter and was served all fried cod. When i asled why i was served only fried the waitress told me they didnt offer half platter to which i asked i would have preferred all baked then if she had bothered to tell me they didnt offer the half platter. So i recieved an all fried fish dinner which i then asked to have exchanged for  a sub par chewy baked fish fillet. My husband order the catfish platter and was asked for a soup or salad with the meal which we didnt realize never came until after we had eaten and even then we asked why we never recieved it to which our reply was \"sorry\".  During the meal we had a substitute waitress bring out my plate of baked cod because she didnt know where our waitress was.... ANYWAYS. ALL IN ALL PLEASE FOR YOUR SANITY DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Review is only about using a credit card here.  When we received our credit card receipt it had a non cash adjustment of 4% on it.  No where on the menu or on our bill did it say there would be a charge.  Our waitress never told us this either.  We asked and she said this was something new and there was nothing she could do about it.  For this reason alone we will not be back."}
{"text":"Ive only been here once. The food was overcooked. Staff wasn't very friendly. Save yourself a bad night out and avoid this place."}
{"text":"My last review of another place, Yelp forced a one star. Today I had lunch here and I'd like the choice of another so I could give six stars. Hey, it's Friday, calling for a fish fry. My first thought when my food came was if it's as good as it looks and smells, it's going to be good. The fish (two large pieces) was perfectly fried, not greasy and flaked beautifully.   The fries were  just right. The salad bar while small had a nice variety of veggies as well as real bacon bits. There was coleslaw (very good), cottage cheese (very fresh) and potato salad. There were 6 dressing choices. This was my first visit but won't be my last. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My wife and I received a gift certificate to try this place. I was a bit unsure about going after reading reviews online.    We arrived at about 7 pm on a Saturday night. The place was pretty quiet. It looked like a few regulars were at the bar socializing.  We sat in the dining room to the left.  The smell of firewood filled the air and gave you a comfortable cozy feeling.    My wife ordered the Snow Crab legs which were  $17, she said they were just \"ok.\" I ordered the fried cod  (available all week). The cod was actually pretty good.  That ran  $10. We both took the salad bar option which is included with dinner.  The salad bar seemed clean and well stocked.    The service was actually timely,  we didn't wait long for food,  refills or our check.  The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.    Overall I'd go back, although I think my wife would order something different as would I.   3 Stars for being just \"Ok .\""}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night. It was OK.  I hate giving bad reviews but this place was definitely not destination worthy.    My GF had the prime rib which was tender but bland.  I had the crab legs. They were pretty small. The \"juice wasn't worth the squeeze\" on a couple of the legs.  Both entrees came with a salad bar which had maybe 10 ingredients to choose from. Not impressive.  To top it off there was a fan running full blast right above our table. When we asked the waitress to turn it down she told us that the manager was the only person who knew how to turn it down and he was on vacation.  So our food got cold really quickly.   If you are in Cottage Grove and want a bar burger I'm sure this place will suffice but not much beyond that."}
{"text":"Food is so-so ( if you end up getting what you ordered!) and the  service is awful. Last visit we were overwhelmed by the scent of a possible sewer back up?! Yuck!"}
{"text":"Far east side Madison resident so quick and easy to get to the Black Bear.  The casual and friendly feel of the place suits me well because I usually stop in for a quick dinner by myself.  I like that I can get a good piece of fish that is not FRIED.  Nothing I have had to eat there is really special but all has been good.  Would like to see a couple better craft beers on tap but they have some good bottled ones as an option.  TIP:  Nice fireplace if you sit in the dining room but don't sit too close to, it gets a bit smoky at times!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in Madison! I have never had a bad dining experience here. Everyone is friendly and the service is very good."}
{"text":"Oh Black Bear Inn... You have so much potential!   It's been almost a week since I devoured your sweet potato fries and I'm still thinking about them! SO GOOD! I'll go as far to say they were the best I've ever had! Super crunchy on the outside, sweet, and soft on the inside. My chicken sandwitch was also delectible. The chicken tasted like it was cooked on a char-coal grill, pounded thin, juicy, tender, and slathered with pepper-jack cheese. Yum Yum! You are right on par with food!  The downsides...Service was friendly but slow. It was Taco Tuesday but your specials were hard to understand and unfortunately, our very kind server had pretty broken english. We wished there would have been something on the tables to reference in writing what they were. We would have loved to try those tacos! Also, your place is ditry! A thick coat of dust covered every surface in the dining room. While that's not the end of the world, it makes me wonder how the back of the house looks if that's how the front of the house is.  Also, our beer tasted a little funky, clean your tappers please!   I really want to make this a regular go to spot, ooohhh those fries, but it needs a really good cleaning. You have potential to steal the scene in Cottage Grove! Your food is delicious enough for people to make a special trip but you need to clean and organize your front of the house a little better. This is one foodies plea to you. I want to spend my money there!"}
{"text":"It was a fun new place to try. They gave us so much food for a good price and it was wonderful. We had a great breakfast and I tried their black bear soda. Loving it"}
{"text":"Delicious fish fry/baked on Friday night.   Waitress took our drink order but didn't return from the bar until about fifteen minutes later with our drinks. Salad bar came with out meal but was completely bare...looked like a crowd just went through but they weren't that busy.  No cheese, no cottage cheese, no \"cukes\", a few pieces of lettuce...that was sad. Every table had complimentary dinner rolls or bread in a basket except us; again our waitress never came back until she brought out bill.  another employee brought out our fish. We finally asked another waiter if bread/rolls came with our fish and he brought us some.  It was worth asking for; nice and warm with butter...mmmmm All things considered, the meal was good and If your lucky enough to be in good company or with someone you love,  you barely notice the inconveniences.  Will definitely come back though, because it was reasonably priced, good baked and fried fish and I believe maybe just an off night for staff there.  A quaint little joint away from the college scene that is my neighborhood.  Sometimes just a little break ."}
{"text":"We have been to the Black Bear several times because we live nearby. We have not been there in several years for fish because the breading is just too thick, but we DO like the breakfasts. So we tend to go there for breakfast or sometimes on Saturday for Prime Rib. That is what made our experience yesterday so disappointing.  We arrived around 9 AM on a Sunday morning for breakfast. We were immediately seated in the dining room. and were told that Marilyn would be our server and she would be right with us. (I'm not sure if I caught her name correctly or not). Anyway, we both quickly decided what we wanted to have to eat. There were 3 other tables of people at the time that we sat down-definitely not busy. Then we sat, and sat, and sat, and sat......3 different servers walked into and out of the dining room during that time. Not one of them made any eye contact with us, nor did they acknowledge that we were there. In the mean time, another table of people were seated right next to us. They were immediately seated, drink order was taken and food order was taken. STILL NO acknowledgement to us. We were seated directly next to this other table. After 15 minutes we got up and left and went to McDonald's."}
{"text":"The food is good - both breakfast and lunch, however every time we have eaten there, it is a little slow.  One time we were there for 30 minutes after we finished eating - waiting for the bill.  Seems to happen quite often."}
