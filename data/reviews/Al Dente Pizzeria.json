{"text":"Horrible!! We went there tonight and the place had about 5 tables with customers. We sat for 10 mins before the waitress came. She took our order and 20 mins later we still didn't have our salads (at this point we had been there a half hour). We witnessed one table get up and leave and another getting apologized to by the manager due to a food mix up.  When we finally walked out there was a lady outside that said the food was horrible and they had to wait an hour for it. The staff is very casually dressed and the atmosphere is very open and strange. No booths, just tables.  I will definitely not be visiting this place again, I give it 1-2 months more and it'll be closed."}
{"text":"Food was okay for the price.   The restaurant is huge and it was very empty at dinner time when we went. Maybe about 2 other parties were seated.  I looked up at the ceiling and the vents and ducts were covered in dust.  It seems like it wasn't cleaned since it was Steak on a Stone As far as customer service it was horrible the waitress was not interested in serving us and when asked a question about the menu she had attitude and kept looking in other directions.   They have cans of pop which is fine but when I asked for a glass of water after I finished my pop she never came back with it.   If it wasn't for the waitress I might try it again but honestly she left such a negative impression that I would have to have a free large pizza coupon to go in order to step foot back into that restaurant"}
{"text":"Not sure where to really start with this one but here goes the long and short of it. In our experience the place did not live up to its \"Al Dente\" name...  The good: -Prices -Fresh mozzarella -What seems to be fresh/homemade dough -Decent Decor but a lot seems to be carried over from Steak on a Stone  The not so good: -Pop only served in a can (not sure if this is just because they just opened or what) but the do have a full bar!?!? -The pizza we had was extremely undercooked and far from \"Al Dente\" -We were there a little after 7 pm and the place had two other people in it that were not the staff. -No side salads on the menu to add to a pizza order, unless you purchased a full size $7 option. -Slow service and overall just seems like a half attempt at a decent restaurant.  My guess is this place is just a filler for an open building in Willoughby. I hate to be overly harsh but it seems the ol' college try wasn't even given on this one. I don't think we will be back to try the other dishes on the menu, which is a shame because they sounded pretty good. The staff seemed completely uninterested in new customers and it really reflected. They either step it up or the building will be empty again."}
