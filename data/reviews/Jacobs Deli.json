{"text":"I cannot believe this. This was my first time ordering from here. I thought, based on the reviews, the food would be good. A little pricey but good. I used UberEATS and got their Big Burke burger. With delivery the bill was $27 dollars. The photo shown on UberEATS was of this beautiful burger with fries. What shows up is an overcooked patty with some smoked meat on it. No toppings. No fries. What an absolute and utter rip off. I feel like they reached into my wallet and stole from me. I'm not one to believe that I'm a special snowflake but this is the height of absurdity."}
{"text":"Just called from LA to have a small order delivered to my mom who is under the weather-  Sydney and his lovely wife made it so easy for me to help my mom. Their kindness and eagerness to help was overwhelming. My mom LOVED their soup and chopped liver!
Wonderfully special people with big hearts --"}
{"text":"The stuffed burger is something unique you can't get anywhere. Really highly recommend"}
{"text":"I would expect a lot more for a place that would call it a kosher deli.  You are a Jewish deli, how can you be out of knishes? How can you have only one option for knishes? Pastrami was not as tender as should be expected. Housekeeping is not their specialty either. If the seating area is less than presentable, what does the kitchen look like? First and last time there."}
{"text":"I love the food at Jacob's deli! Its one of my favourite take out places for a quick and delicious sandwich. Their steak sandwich and burgers are to die for! I just wish the place wasn't so far from me or I'd be visiting it a lot more often. Keep up the good work and please open another location in Toronto (not Thornhill)."}
{"text":"this place definitely caters to the neighborhood clientele. so if you like your deli extra lean, the soup is nuclear hot but under seasoned, nice protein salads, this place is for you..."}
{"text":"I came here after blogto made a note on their latke burgers. I've never had latke before so I was super excited coming in. 

The diner is a little hole in the wall, and weirdly in the same plaza as 2 other diners. There's place for small groups to sit and eat, about two tables and a wall table. I had to wait about 15 mins to get my food on a Wednesday night around 5 pm. 

The menu is looks very diner/pub like. Lots of different types of burgers and poutine. Didn't see any vegetarian options other than the fries and salad. Other than the wraps, nothing was under $15. 

I got the latke burger, and my honest review was that it was okay. I did like the latke. And I do usually like beef burgers. However when it was put together, it wasn't amazing. It felt just the whole product  was just forced. The beef was juicy, and chewy, I usually have a preference to crispy burgers but it wasn't the worst. 

The latke was thick, and yummy but way too soft. You definitely can't hold it in your hands for too long without it breaking apart. The whole burger was just too hard to eat, everything fell apart within seconds. I definitely would've enjoyed the latke better if I was to eat it differently (with a fork and knife)"}
{"text":"Great food! Ordered the large smoked meat sandwich - can honestly say It was better than the Centre St deli, Katzman, Reuben's and Schwartzs deli. Prices are very expensive (even though it is kosher $17 for a sandwich and half a pickle). Will go back and try the poutine next time."}
{"text":"I stopped by Jacobs Deli today first time I've ever been there. Saw the sign driving by and thought here's a hole in the wall little deli. Let me tell you this place might be small but they pack a huge punch in their food. I decided to try the Black Angus Prime Rib sandwich and initially I thought wow $14.99 for just a sandwich is a little steep but that all change in an instant. One bite and I knew it was worth every penny. The flavor and seasoning was spot on the the meat I ordered medium rear and I swear it was like butter. Every bite melted in my mouth so juicy and tender. I'm still thinking about that sandwich right now. There are other items on the menu for example... Smoked meat, burgers, steak etc... I definitely need to go back and you should definitely go try them. Location North East corner of Dufferin and Center."}
{"text":"Our family always tries to try out the kosher restaurants nearby. We love Indian food, and were excited to actually be able to try some meat-dishes for once, so tried to catch the 'Jacob's Curry' pop up. Unfortunately we missed it by a day, but as we were leaving the main shop, the owner suddenly remembered that he was working on a catering order, and offered to give us some portions for that.

Wish we had just left and gone to another restaurant. The food just wasn't good-- it was extremely greasy. The meat dishes tasted OK, but nothing was terribly fresh, and the garlic naan was barely edible (you could have it straight, in which case it was stale and tasteless, or microwave it heavily, in which case it tasted OK but dripped oil everywhere).

He also overcharged us by about $10 (it was very expensive anyways for what we got) and hasn't bothered responding to our emails to him. Presumably, he figured this was a good way to ditch some extra food. Given that Toronto needs more innovative kosher restaurants, I really wish I could recommend Jacobs. However it just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"The front cashier really delivered top notch service and was very welcoming to the never ending line of customers coming in and out. The food was as good as people say so there was no disappointment - just a pleasant surprise for a girl like me who doesn't frequent deli's as much as I should. My man's turkey club sandwich was fresh and one of the best he's had in a while. My black angus burger was cooked to medium, as requested, and they remembered to put lots of ketchup and mustard. The patty my have been slightly drier than desired but the seasoning and freshness made up for it."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. I'm just going to get that off my chest.

There are some hits and misses but this is a place that is well worth going to. The quality of the food is great the selection is great and the staff is friendly.

I tried the following (We're a group that like to share our food):

The Deli Sandwich (Fresser) - Corned Beef and Honey Mustard - I had one serious problem with this sandwich and that it was dry. The meat was great and the amount received was generous. But it needed something to moisten the Sandwich. Next time I'm going order gravy on the side to have it ready to dip into.....then this sandwich will be EPIC.

The Deli Sandwich (Fresser) - Smoked Turkey (No Mustard) - I found the meat cold but more moist than the corned beef. Good flavor going on here. I'd recommend it.

Large Fries - REALLY generous for a Kosher place....do not change that.....that was a lot of fries for $4.50

Open Faced Roast Beef Sandwich in Gravy -This was a good sandwich and I'd have it again....and again and again....from different angles....really a good meal here. It's not directly on the menu but the staff will work with you there so have fun!

The one thing that deters me from going to this place is the parking lot. I hate it. I hate parking there and I hate how cramped it is there. But then again....the craving for deli meat can overcome that once in a while.

Check it out! Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This is a good burger deli joint anyone seeking out kosher or halal burgers/deli the Angus was decent sized and fresh and smoky and the service was nice n fast
However the downer is being kosher they dont have cheese and for a 15 bucks a pop no fries :( wished they also did ribs. 
Given that halal/kosher deli is a rare commodity will definitely go back to try out the rest of the menu"}
{"text":"The greatest deli! Amazing smoked meat and sandwiches of all types. Ask for a sandwich in a baguette- so good!"}
{"text":"The service is great, without a doubt. 
The question you need to ask yourself is, 
Are you willing to pay $18 for a quarter pound burger patty that will sometimes be inconsistently burned to a crisp? 
Also, $20 poutine? Seriously?! I mean, it's good, but let's get real. 
Verdict:
Friendly, very over-priced and inconsistent."}
{"text":"Food is really good but the cashiers taking your order need to learn a lot about customer service.  This restaurant seems to have an endless number of people at the front, and very few over the last few years have been any good.
Bottom line, I go for the food but the cashiers always make me a bit uneasy whenever I go in."}
