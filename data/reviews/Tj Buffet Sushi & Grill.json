{"text":"For $5 he can't go wrong . The  sushi itself is worth the $5. I almost feel guilty so I usually order a pop ."}
{"text":"Skip at all costs. They had 3 sushi offering out on a Sunday evening at 6pm and no menu to choose from to have more made. The lady said they don't make more because it's not busy. All of the buffet food was lukewarm, bland and flavorless. No one was working the hibachi station but they had hibachi food sitting out. Would not recommend....plenty of other sushi offering around, try those instead."}
{"text":"Me and my sweetheart decided to stop in for lunch the other day. Ive been to this location when it was under different managment and it was acceptable. The place looks clean and has a sushi bar and hibachi grill. For 6.99 lunch how can you go wrong??? Well to put it simply, the food is gross. I understand chinese buffets are never high quality but this place is ridiculous.  Not much variety and what they have isnt very good. The honey chicken was just soggy chicken with cheap honey drizzled on top. The fried rice was dry and tasted old. The bourbon chicken was ok. The fried potstickers were greasy and chewy. The sushi bar is a joke.  In the glass window they have sushi grade fish on display but none of the rolls contain the fish. WHAT A TEASE!! Their rolls consist of cream cheese cucumber and imitation crab...that was it. I stayed clear of the hibachi grill. It looked rather suspect. My sweetheart who normally eats 2-3 plates ate 1 small 1 before tapping out. I normally try to eat myself in to a coma when I go to buffets but that didnt happen here! I guess since its so cheap you cant expect too much but its pretty bad. Pros: clean environment, cheap price cons: the food is terrible."}
{"text":"Went here for some quick sushi take out. Was not expecting the best, but I was expecting something at least edible. Stay away from any sushi with fish or imitation crab! Fish tasted chewy, smelt very strong, and did not taste right. Imitation crab was hard like it had somehow gone stale. Again, as I said, I was not expecting anything fancy... but I threw it out, it tasted like food poisoning waiting to happen. Not sure about other food at the buffet, but after that, I am never coming back."}
{"text":"The worse buffet I ever been to, the place I say it smell like  piss. The food were cold and there is barely any food. Never going back again!"}
{"text":"The customer sevice was excellent and the waiters were friendly..They came to check on us a lot and the food was delicious  for a great price...Please come here, they were awesome!!!"}
{"text":"We tried this place out when it first opened under this name and it was one of the best buffets I have ever experienced. So much selection, very fresh...that being said, we went again last week (over a year after the first time) and were SEVERELY disappointed. We walked in expecting the same as last time and were very upset to see that the selection had been GREATLY diminished and it was back to being one of the worst Chinese buffets around. They had no white rice the entire time we were there, I also kept watching the servers pouring new food into the older food and just mixing it up... not a great practice... The sushi was okay, but it was basically like grocery store sushi and everything else was nothing special. Left very disappointed and won't be back."}
{"text":"I went to this place just to try something new. Sometimes the daily grind wears on you, and you need to introduce some variety into things. So, we went to TJ Sushi.  And then, everything changed.  Upon entering, you get the feeling that there's something going on here -- something amazing. You walk by a mysterious bubble tank and a small plastic cat on your way to a generously sized table in a cozy dining area, and are then set loose to enjoy the myriad treasures inside.  The first several buffet carts trick you into thinking that this is merely a specialized Chinese cuisine restaurant - but not so fast. Cast into the mix of authentic East-Asian delicacies are generously portioned gobs of garlic bread, fresh baked pizza, chicken wings, French fries, and more. To your right, an active and very trendy sushi bar, with real Japanese sushi chefs chopping away at the morning's catch. In the back, delicate French pastries. In short, the kitchen is staffed by a global assortment of the best chefs and cooks from every continent - a culinary Olympics, if you will - with every entry sticking the landing, and winning gold.  Standard buffet behavior ensues - go and get a plate of every single available option. Nothing is thrown away. Our group engorged themselves on the finest offerings of any restaurant in Ohio - we recommend the squirrel-on-a-stick, chicken with red stuff, or the egg-fu-young. The soups-of-the-day are amazing on their own, or go ahead and get a ladle-full each, and drop in some chives and won-tons -- at TJ Buffet, the world is your oyster. Unless you want oysters, they don't have that. Well, they might, because there's a lot of chewy stuff in the seafood medley. Go there and find out!  The desserts are where this place distinguishes itself and achieves excellence. A world-class ice cream flavor bin gives you the infusion of cookies-and-cream, white, brown, and green that you need to build up your stamina. Skip the fancy pastries and cakes and head for the bananas. Bananas with red is amazing and I can only imagine how many generations of real live Chinese people have passed down the recipe with the hopes that some day, it would get to me. Well, it did, and it was breathtaking. Even better is bananas with white - that comes with a high concentration of 'nilla wafers, which is how you know this place spares no expense. Finally, I recommend the dessert \"sticky peaches,\" which doesn't get the fanfare of the banana dishes, but in my opinion is highly underrated. The marshmallows, sticky white goo stuff, and fresh-cut peach slices from all-American Georgia peaches don't just tantalize the taste buds - they force their goodness right into your bowels.  Finally, the waitstaff leaves fortune cookies. How is it that they always know when I am done? 5, 6, 7, 8 times refilling, but the last time is always the time they bring the bill! It must be some ancient Japanese wisdom type stuff. The fortune cookies at this place we find to be more accurate than fortune cookies from any other Chinese restaurant. They are also specially designed to be paired with the phrase \"-in bed\" added to the end - just like ancient Confucian wisdom intends.  In the car ride back to work after lunch (or home after dinner -- which I believe costs $0.75 and comes with fresh steamed crab legs, locally sourced from the shoreline of Prospect Ave) you will still be in awe of what just happened to you - what you did to yourself, your dignity, right there in public, with all those willing participants. Something special goes on in that building every day, and it's called America.  At the very end of your car ride, you'll probably experience intestinal discomfort - ignore that, it's normal and probably unrelated."}
{"text":"I did not like this Chinese buffet at all. Unfortunately, there are no other Chinese buffets in this area so you were kind of out of luck. If it were me I'd rather drive over to Eastlake or down to Boston Heights then eat here."}
{"text":"AWEFUL!!! ... We love buffets and we are not big in fancy restaurants but this place is just horrible ... there were FLIES in some areas of the food section ... food selection was sub-par ... the only decent thing was their hibachi which was cook in front of you and you know it is made fresh ... NOT worth the money and trip!"}
{"text":"It, like many buffets started out some promising and then just kind of started to decline.  I will say it is not horrible food and the hibachi and sushi kind of help to off set the the rest of the menu.  Service is great and the folks are nice."}
{"text":"The booth we sat in was torn to pieces. The food was not even hot. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"It gets the job done, cheaply. I just wish they'd bring the little egg custards back."}
{"text":"So, I've seen this place go through several incarnations of late, but this one is truly exceptional. I stopped by yesterday for a bite and I was actually impressed.   The food quality is good and the prices are really great for someone who wants something healthy and tasty all at the same time that won't break your wallet. They have a small selection of sushi, and more of standard Chinese Buffet fair, all of it good. On top of that the staff are very personable and the new re-design of the place is open and inviting. I've seen this place in past versions, and I think this one is a winner.   I'd heartily suggest this place for a quick bite with friends, or maybe a place you and your co-workers could go for some midday fare.   All in all, I'd say TJ all the way:)"}
{"text":"An impressive selection of food including sushi at a very reasonable price. I am particularly fond of the grill selection"}
{"text":"Place is dirty, tried it twice now the second time we got violently sick. The hot food section barely keeps the food warm let alone hot. The owner really needs too step back and realize the poor food and lack of food safety. Patron beware this might have been a one time thing but by the looks of it lack of care seems to be ongoing and not worth a third attempt."}
{"text":"Food is average, staff is friendly but sometimes a little absent. Food would benefit from being a little warmer, but a constant stream of clientele allowed for constant refreshing of the buffet at lunch which was good.  Sushi was surprisingly decent with a hibachi offering too. All in all, for 6 dollars you can't go wrong"}
{"text":"This place use to be really good but the last few time I've been in it's been close to awful. The  sushi sucks completely. No flavor in the rice at all and the have like 2 kinds might as well not have sushi at all! The hibachi table is always unattended, the Chinese buffet section is like a vegetarian section cause all the dishes that mention chicken beef or seafood are only prepared with veggies! Which is not bad but to the management don't be stingy with your meats!!! The fruits where good Thoth. I hope next time I came back is better..."}
{"text":"This WAS a place we came often.  No more.  Visited Wed. 9/21 about 6:30 PM and there were only 2 table filled.  Buffet usually fine..... egg foo young COLD    baby fried shrimp hard, not eatable, the food on the buffet was not only cold, but O L D.  It was apparent it had been there for hours.  It was truly not appetizing, or chewable.  We will NOT go back there. It's sad because it started off as a friendly, good food buffet.  Old food is not acceptable."}
{"text":"Second time here and smartly started off at the build your own hibachi station.  While my assortment of noodles, vegetables and beef in garlic sauce was being prepared, I filled a plate with a nice assortment of sushi. The sushi was surprisingly good. Enjoyed this place more the second time due to being knowledgable about what to get (and pass on).  Don't come here expecting to have exquisite Asian cuisine ... But you can uncover a few great dishes if you have a discerning eye. Great value at only &10 per person."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when going here for first time. We have a great buffet we go to close to home in Mentor, a great Chinese buffet. Oddly this one was laid out very similar as far as food trays in same locations on buffet line. I did like there fried chicken, ribs, and rice better. Oh and sweet dour chicken was really good. Spring rolls/sushi was as expected. Nice place to relax, clean and friendly on out first visit. I'll take kids this time and see what they say. Not sure why food wasn't steaming like our regular place, it was not as hot...as far as disappointing was egg foo yung one of my favs, couple things seemed a little under browned. All in all...enjoyed a nice meal!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place today with a friend. We went around 2:30 to grab some lunch. A very nice guy greeted us and sat us at a booth. I guess the place recently changed ownership or something. Inside looked very nice. In my opinion the food was good most of the buffet options are your standard buffet food choices but I also think they tasted a lot better then some other buffets I've been to. My favorite is the hibachi. Only one sauce but they put garlic chili oil and a teriyaki sauce on your stir fry. The had a good selection for hibachi napa cabbage good quality chicken/steak shrimp glass noodle or rice not sure what they were they also have lo mein noodles onions fake krab zucchini and a few other options. I enjoyed the sesame seed chicken and there potstickers. They sushi bar only offers about 5 different types or rolls but the young guy making sushi was very nice to me and made whatever i requested. Most buffets I have gone to only offer normal rolls for lunch with the bigger cuts or fish on rice only for dinner. I asked for the strips on salmon on top of rice and he gladly made me a plate. We have a coupon $2.00 off two lunch buffet came in a coupon book from the mail. I would go again but since I live about 20 min from here sadly it will not be my to go to spot although I wish i could make it my go to spot. Stop in give it a try. think lunch is $6 and dinner is like $8 or 9."}
{"text":"The reason why i gave tj buffet sushi & Grill 2 stars ws because when we went to go up to the hibachi area they had raw chicken, meat, etc they even had shrimp, and when i was going to grab some shrimp i saw a hair in the shrimp!! yuck good thing i looked twice, everything else was good, the decor was outstanding, and they actually play american music! they also had a decent crwod i say that because all the booths were taken."}
{"text":"I've given this buffet two chances and I can officially say that I've given it all I can take. I remember the first time, the service was so bad at the front desk that we almost walked out. This last time I went on a Sunday when the dinner price was $7.99 per person. Can't beat that price, but I feel that the buffet has a very limited variety compared to other Chinese buffets.   What I really went there for that day was the hibachi. I prepared a plate of what I wanted grilled and ended up standing there for about 10 minutes even after both ringing the bell and asking another employee to notify the chef I was waiting! Unacceptable. Once I finally got it, it had to be the hottest, freshest thing in that restaurant because I found most of the buffet food to be cold.  Sorry to say that I won't be wanting to come back here unless I'm absolutely desperate."}
{"text":"'60s rock and Motown hits, pink and green cove lighting, bright colors and fixtures and chicken done dozens of ways, this buffet will deliver if your hungry and want something tasty.   Food is fresh and hot (come when it's busy, the food is rotated frequently). There is a Hibachi grill and sushi bar, and a fruit and dessert bar. Most of the dishes are chicken and sea food, with one or two beef or pork dishes. Of course there is an American flair in the cuisine here, really good french fries.   The staff is friendly, but seem not to speak much English. Every time someone leaves, a hostess rushes up and says \"thank you!\" with a great big smile. Before you can sit down to get your coat off, they rush over to ask what you'd like to drink. But they're all really friendly. The the front desk host is really nice and very accommodating.   Overall, this is a great spot to grab some lunch or dinner at a very affordable price!"}
{"text":"Thank you to the previous reviewers because that ultimately helped my co-worker and I decide to try this place out. We were hesitant because you know, sometimes these Chinese buffet places can be gross. This one was not. Really good selection of different types of foods including vegetables. hibachi, sushi and other typical buffet offerings. I liked the brussel sprouts and the green beans.  Nice to have some veggies with all that fried food. The fried rice was kind of weird, like yellowish, tasted ok. My friend liked the hibachi a lot. I did not try it as I was stuffed. I had a couple pieces of sushi that I thought was above average for this type of place. All in all, great place to have a decent and affordable lunch. Close to work too. Yay!"}
{"text":"Visited here with my daughter for the lunch buffet.  We have been to this location before, when it was under prior ownership.  I figured we would give it a try...would've been better off going to Taco Bell.  Strangely, the food tasted pretty good going down.  I'm going to guess that the small sampling of sushi we tried was the problem.  I stayed away from anything raw, but I should've just stayed away...period.  Let's just say both of us had some gastrointestinal issues once we got home...  Well, at least it was pretty cheap, but it is also the last time we'll eat there."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting and I'm very disappointed. They do have a large variety of food but the food is tasteless, which is my biggest complaint. The egg rolls were basically empty inside and tough. The fried wing dings were not that tasty. I couldn't eat the brocolli on my plate because something that I couldn't recognize was hanging off of it. The vegetable fried rice barely had any vegetables in it. All of the food was cold. On top of that my glass was dirty with someone's lipstick. Though everyone I dealt with was quite nice I can't go back. Good price at $4.99 before 4pm but still not worth it."}
{"text":"Typical, Chinese  buffet. Lunch was only 5$, that's right 5$. F-the 5$ foot long. Food was fresh and service was attentive. Not a lot of seafood but for 5$ you can not complain"}
{"text":"It was horrible.. i found a piece of hair in the sweet and sour sauce. Besides that they wouldn't bring out new food! So you eat what has been out all day... lukewarm everything. Dont waste your time."}
{"text":"I typically have avoided Chinese buffets after finding most are unappetizing and not well stocked.  So I never paid any mind to TJs either.  I was really missing out!  I've only been here for lunch when they are busy, which is the best time to eat buffet style food so everything is fresh.  Incredibly, this is by far the best Chinese food in the area and it is half the price too.  The sheer volume and variety of food they offer is pretty amazing.  In addition to the standards you'll find at any Chinese restaurant, they also have french fries, chicken wings, soups, and whole baked salmon.    There are a half dozen serving stations and each has 10-12 items.  The steamed rice is served from the steamer with a lid, so there are no crusty dried grains to avoid like other buffets have.  The sushi offerings are also good and have variety of at least 8 different rolls.  California roll and Philly roll are here, plus some adventurous ones as well.  Save room for dessert too.  There are puddings, fruits, cookies, cupcakes, carrot cake, jello, and even ice cream!  This is a great place for kids.  Mine are picky eaters, and the wide variety along with all the dessert offerings always has them eating without a fuss and leaving satisfied.  The service is fast and friendly.  You don't wait to be seated, have your drink refilled or to pay.  That alone is better than most places I can think of.  The buffet is constantly being replenished too.  If you are in a hurry, it's faster, cheaper and better than the many fast food offerings nearby.  They even sell containers to go, by-the-pound."}
{"text":"I was feeling a bit adventurous and agreed to go with the family to a buffet, an Asian food buffet. I do NOT eat at buffets let alone eat sushi from one. Tonight though, I put my life in their hands.   The dinner buffet is $8. They will make you sushi rolls to order. The staff was super friendly and attentive and when they saw me looking around the sushi counter, they came right over and asked what I liked in my sushi. I told them tuna, avocado, crab... within a few minutes she had prepared three rolls for me, a tuna and avocado roll, salmon and cucumber and one with crab avocado and cucumber. The sauces are available to add to your liking. This is all I ate. The rice was slightly gooey but I enjoyed the three rolls at the price of $8, that was a deal!  As for the rest of my family, the buffet food looked pretty gross and they were only able to find a couple things to eat. There were many of your typical buffet sweets and fried doughs and that's what they mostly filled up on.   The environment was dull. It did appear clean. I don't think I'll be back, but if you like to eat sushi and lots of it for a low price, this is your spot... hence the two stars."}
{"text":"Excellent for the price point. Did not try the sushi but next time definitely plan on it. Very quaint atmosphere."}
{"text":"I would easily given this a hearty 5 stars, glowing review for the buffet alone!! The broccoli was bright green, the pepper chix was delicious, (i was a little meh about the gen tso's chix lack of spicey heat) and the dessert were fresh and varied (the beat of any buffet I have ever been).  The hibachi even looks like it could be promising (not too much variety, but a good amount). But, and its a big butt (this is a buffet after all), the sushi looks rough.  If this place was not called TJs sushi and buffet, I think more peoples expectations would be met and this would easily be a four or five star place.  This is by far the best Chinese buffet anywhere on the east aide of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, you do not come to a Chinese buffet for the finest in cuisine. If you are comparing one to a Michelin star restaurant, you might need to check your expectations.  However, this place is better than any Chinese buffet I've tried. The food was hot and fresh, they had my usual favorites, and the staff was very friendly.  The sushi was tasty according to my companion, and they had a decent variety.  But the best part was the hibachi style stir fry.  Choose your meat, noodles and veggies, enjoy some conversation with the chef (the other guy didn't want garlic so the chef tossed it into mine with a smirk - thank you!), and before you know it you have a hot garlicky plate that I couldn't stop eating. I'm smacking my lips thinking about it, now.  I finished it off with one of the classic sugar doughnuts and some hard ice cream - not soft serve, like most buffets.  Ten dollars. Ten. Dollars.  Cheapest, best Chinese buffet, bottom line."}
{"text":"I'm impressed by the food quality at this Chinese buffet.  I've gone to this restaurant for lunch on Saturday and on Sunday.  Lunch on both days is for under $10.  For what you're getting, this is an excellent value.  Don't expect anything radically different from your typical Chinese buffet.  The choices are the same, but of higher quality and fresher.  Items that stood out: the barbecue spare ribs (probably the best spare ribs I've eaten at a Chinese buffet), the peanut butter chicken (think of chicken tempura with a peanut sauce), and the chicken with mushrooms.  Overall, the food was tasty, but not greasy.    The sushi selection isn't as large as in other buffets, but the quality is very good for a buffet.  The hibachi is decent - less vegetables than in other buffets and there is only one standard sauce.  I did notice that they cook rice noodles as well as egg noodles on the grill, which I have not seen in many places.  Things that could be improved: the hot and sour soup, while reasonably tasty, was way too thick.   The cakes were okay, but not very moist.  Also not a huge fan of the dumplings."}
{"text":"The sushi was actually good for buffet sushi. I think general consensus is that the price is nice and cheap, so make sure you go during a busy time so that the food is fresh and well stocked. You are less likely to be disappointed that way. My husband got a giant plate of teriyaki shrimp from the hibachi, which was awesome. So yeah, when fresh, it's a great deal and pretty tasty. During the slow hours, not so good."}
{"text":"Cheap. Greasy. Nothing great. Actually enjoyed it more than the place across the street that costs 2-3 times more.   You get what you pay for and for $5 bucks, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Positives:  - The price! Where else can you find such a cheap price for so much food!?  - Hibachi Bar. While the selection for it isn't great, it is nice to be able to get a fresh hot plate.  - Usually nicely stocked. You don't have to wait long for them to refill a food tray.  Negatives:  - Quality of food. After having other buffets in the area, the quality is lower. You do get what you pay for.  - Amount of oil. I do realize that most Chinese places use a lot of oil, but this place uses a lot of oil in everything.   - Trying to communicate with some of the waitresses. Getting individual checks and not just a check for the table is not always the easiest.   Overall- price keeps people coming back, but quality is lacking. 3 stars."}
{"text":"I guess if you are looking for an all you can eat buffet that won't cost an arm and a leg, you MAY like this place.   I did not.   Most of the food is either fried and/or is covered in one gelatinous \"sauce\" or another. I came away feeling crummy.   The staff is borderline hostile. While you're pulling your chair out to sit down, they run over and ask what you want to drink. No menus, they don't tell you what they have to drink - you're just supposed to know.   Ok. Beer? No beer. Coke Zero? She looked at me like I asked for horse piss. She wrinkled her nose and repeated back to me, \"Coke zero?!?!\" I said, \"Diet Coke?\" She said, \"Diet Pepsi\". Whatever.   Off she went. I wondered if they had the deal where you pick your meats and noodles and whatnot and they cook them for you. I approached the hostess/manager and said, \"I've never been here before. Can you tell me how it works?\" She said, \"All food.\" and walked away. I saw some people later with it so apparently they do offer it but when I walked over to what I thought was that section, there was nobody there to help me.  It was very loud in there and they played the music very loud also, making it impossible to have a conversation.  As you probably gather, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Today, my daughter went to work with me, so I decided to take her out to lunch.  Her options were a Chinese buffet, an Indian buffet, or a Mexican buffet.  She chose the Chinese buffet, so off to TJ we went.  Upon arrival, we were greeted and seated.  Drink orders were taken and we were on our way to the buffet.  There were quite a few buffet booths with various types of food.  Most of the classic chicken dishes were available, including General Tso, teriyaki, honey, sweet n sour, sesame, and wings.  There were some steamed green beans and also some Brussels sprouts, which were very tasty.  The fried rice was just okay and the noodle bin was empty the entire time, so I didn't get to try those.  I feasted primarily on the spicy mushrooms.  They're offered with chicken in a spicy sauce, but I only grab the shrooms.  Why?  Because mushrooms are God's gift to my taste buds.  Love em!  Most of the food was just average, but one item stood out.  The egg tarts were amazing.  I ate two of them!  It was the one thing on the buffet that I found to be delicious.  They were crunchy on the outside, they were visually pleasing, and they were soft, sweet, and delicious on the inside.  Definitely the best egg tart I've ever had.  The sushi was weak, however.  Every type had cream cheese in it.  It's good, but What gives?  I'll be back, but not for sushi."}
{"text":"We found this place accidentally and because we've never heard of this place before, we took a look at the food before we decided to sit down and eat there. The food was ok. Nothing too fancy but not bad or low quality either. Just some chinese food - some very americanized like seasame chicken. They have a hibachi section too but I didn't try it. The sushi was not the freshest so I didn't eat too many of them. It was 10.50 per person for lunch for us. Pretty cheap huh. I liked our waitress - she was nice. I didn't like the manager/boss sitting at the front desk tho. He looked disinterested in treating us well."}
{"text":"OK, not great. Not even good, really*.  But cheap!  All-you-can-eat dinner was under $8.00. I estimate the actual value, assuming five heaping plate-loads, at around $6.50. Would be worth $7.00 except many \"hot\" dishes are room temperature--they can't afford to keep the buffet hot apparently. That said, service is friendly and decor is trippy. And being charged $8.00 for a huge meal worth $6.50 is only a waste of $1.50, at the end of which your digestive tract has successfully been filled. I'll go back, when I'm feeling cheap. Not much for vegetarians, I'm afraid, but you'll find a few things.  * The mini chocolate cupcakes are delicious! I bet you'd have to go to China to find better."}
{"text":"It's actually pretty good!  The service is friendly and quick.  The sushi is very good.  The food is very good except for the chicken which is sub par.  I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Trying any Chinese Buffet is taking a chance.  This one was a pleasant experience. Meats, veggies, salads and desserts, and sushi! Everything I tried was tasty.  Sushi, Bourbon chicken, Peanut butter chicken, steamed green beans, Lo mein, and more.  Didn't try the desserts.  Too much other good foods.  Very nice decor.  Clean restrooms.  It's a big place. Lunch was $6.99.  A pot of tea was $1.  Located in a strip center. Lots of parking along Mayfield Road."}
{"text":"This place is good to come during the week and if you come before 4:00 you pay $4.99 but today I'm giving them 2 stars because the food was terrible, so I would never come back on a Monday. If this had been my first experience you would never see me here again. The egg foo young was out, no dim sum, very small selection of sushi, egg rolls cold and old, I didn't even try the broccoli it wasn't even green anymore. I've never seen it this bad. If it's busy then the food is good hot and fresh"}
{"text":"I was expecting good things based upon the reviews. However, it wasn't very good at all. First of all, vthey need to take the word 'sushi' out of their name. 4 selections? Just because imitation crab is wrapped in rice doesn't mean you can call it sushi. The other food selections were luke warm at best.... There are much better places to go in the area"}
{"text":"Maybe I was here on the wrong night, but I thought most everything I tried was mediocre, at best...  Some dishes were terrible: Potstickers were dried out, shrimp was off, seaweed salad looked a little slimy, sweet & sour chicken tasted like old meat, lo mein noodles were over cooked and broken, sushi fish was dried out...you get the idea. The hibachi bar closed at 8pm, although there was no sign indicating hours (I was there before 8 PM, but had a plate of something else first, and therefore missed it).  Three soups were so disappointing I didn't finish them (wonton, egg drop, hot & sour). The only thing I really liked was the Veg Egg Foo Young and the accompanying gravy. The nice ladies at a nearby table told me they only have a few dishes, avoiding the rest. So, I'm not alone in being disappointed.  I don't recommend this place."}
