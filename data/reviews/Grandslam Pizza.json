{"text":"I didn't have time to take a picture. Our pizzas came and we wolfed it down. Fresh ingredients; nice crust; a good mix of cheeses.   I'm known as the \"Pizzaholic\"- Grand slam is 20 miles from me but worth the drive. I'll be back - SOON."}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza there and it was one of the blandest pizza I have ever had. There was no tastes whatever. Don't think they had any spice in the sauce."}
{"text":"Enjoyed one of their 6 inch Italian subs.  Delicious!!  Nice dining area.  Even better was the service and friendly staff.  I will be back to sample the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing staff and even better food. Friendly and fun environment. A place where they care about the customers needs. Never experienced a bad anything here. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Honestly this pizza is really average... nothing fantastic at all. The salads are 99.9% lettuce and nothing else. But the worst of all is the owner runs his shop. Sometimes they are closed at random times throughout the day and never answer the phone. Also they do not always have a delivery driver. VERY disappointed in this place"}
{"text":"Customer service is excellent! The sandwiches and pizzas are excellent. The prices are a very good value.  They often have Facebook offers that make a good value a great value.  The ingredients they use are of very high quality.  The seating area is well decorated in baseball memorabilia and has always been clean each time we have been there.  They also from time to time have wing or pizza eating challenges. And they are always a very good time."}
{"text":"The sauce and toppings were good and it arrived fast and hot... however, the crust was bland and the large was not large at all. And we got the fewest toppings on a pizza we have ever seen. I'd take your business elsewhere for the price."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.  Waited 1 1/2 hr for home delivery.  Was told I would get free order plus coupons.  Did not get either.  When brought up to management, they did not make that offer good.  They do not back up their word.  Go to Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite pizza in Monroeville. They put seasonings on the crust so that you enjoy the entire slice of pizza, not just the part with the \"goodies\". They frequently offer deals or coupons and it's a great value for such good pizza. Two thumbs up from our family!"}
{"text":"Well, since there is a 1 and 5 star review I should be the tie breaker.  It's a really solid American style pizza place. It's not a 5th generation recipe perfected in Tuscany. It's not gourmet, artisanal, gluten free pizza place. But if you need a pizza itch scratched, this place will do it and for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Blah! Ordered a medium pepperoni. Store bought crust, minimal cheese and pepperoni, with a cardboard taste. Really disappointed. Don't bother!"}
{"text":"Ordered a steak and cheese hoagie. I ate less than half and threw the rest in the garbage. I was the only customer in there in the middle of the afternoon. The meat was just warm and they put cold cheese on the meat and never even melted the cheese which was very dry and tasteless. As I was leaving they never even asked how my food was as i had told them This was my first visit. I will never go back and I pass this place every day"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the flavor of the pizza a lot from here and honestly the subs were not bad. This isn't the greatest pizza but better then chains. The problem is I think they do not get off all of the cleaner from the pizza pans. This is the only place that kills my family's stomach when eating pizza. It's every time to the point when we drive by we now call it Grand Slam Waterfalls. I really wish this wasn't an issue because taste wise and where it is is very convenient. Our stomachs just can't take the after effects."}
{"text":"Location gets an A+! When we needed to feed a group of people in a stitch, this place was accessible and convenient. We used an online special for a large 1-topping pizza and the speed and quality were good! It also looks like they have a bunch of sides and wing flavors so I'll definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Pizza! Always affordable prices and daily specials I swing by this place. Obviously yyour pizza choice is largely about proximity, but if you are anywhere near this place you should  check it out! I love how much cheese they use, and you can tell the dough is always fresh!"}
{"text":"Grandslam pizza is the best pizza around, imho. They are so nice to speak to. Delivery is fast and food is always nice and hot. It is also great tasting and inexpensive.   I am also a fan of their steak n cheese hoagie. It's so delish!  Fad@@Â€++ their calzones!   The only food item I think needs to be better is their breadsticks. They are hard and tough  And the seasoning on they needs to be upgraded some how.  If they can fix the breadsticks better I'd definitely buy them.        I"}
