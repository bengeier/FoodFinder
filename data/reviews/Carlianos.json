{"text":"If i could give no stars I would, server was poorly dressed and dirty. Food was disgusting  The muscles came I. Two different colors I wouldn't even try it. Bruschetta was different but ok. I orders a martini, gin it cam cloudy looking, he called it dirty, I called it disgusting. Will not go back ever"}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here via Skip the Dishes for a company lunch, so I can't comment on the restaurant or service, as I've never even stepped foot in the place. I also can't comment on what other people ate. The main reason for choosing this place was that there was free delivery and the place was close by just in case we wanted to do pick up.  The correct food order came, which can sometimes be an issue through StD. I had the NY steak, which was nothing special. Not worth the price and would not order again. The meat was tough, not seasoned well, and completely forgettable. I could make a better steak at home for half the price paid.  The calamari and tzatziki was okay. The PEI Mussels were okay. The jalapeno poppers were good.  Overall, it was just okay. I've definitely had way better of everything I ate here. Will probably order from somewhere else next time. Food was overpriced and not worth it for the quality received."}
{"text":"Do not go here. The end.   We should have known to avoid this place when we saw the owner (?) sitting outside of the restaurant because there was not a soul inside. We asked to see a menu before we decided to sit down and asked about the speed of service. We had somewhere to be and couldn't afford to wait long. He mentioned that he would tell his \"cook\" to pick it up (I use quotes because we later found out there was no cook, he was the cook). I'll add that the man had attitude with us almost the entire time, as if we were a bother. We all ordered. He brought drinks. And then we waited.. and waited.. and waited. For someone who promised quick service, he did not deliver. I think it was about 45 minutes before one of us went to knock on the kitchen door, and finally he came out.   Hamburger meal: $16 before tax. Burger was a burger but literally six (we counted) French fries.  An order of fries and small Pepsi: 12 fries on this plate burnt so crispy that there was no potato left inside and charged for a large Pepsi and he wouldn't change it.  Bruschetta with so much jalape√±o that it was hard to eat. And this comes from someone who is a fan of spicy foods.  Zucchini sticks: $11 before tax. Literally four hunks of a zucchini stick burnt to unrecognizable. It should have come with a side of sour cream. Whatever he sent out was not sour cream (unless it was gone bad). I asked for sour cream and did not get anything.  Another order consisted of sweet chili Thai wings. Again, so burnt you couldn't even taste the flavor.  Finally, and maybe the funniest order, we asked about an adult chicken tender meal. He said no problem. Then he came out with the kids order and said yeah I forgot. Ummm..what? Lol and laid it down. It wasn't even worth the price for kids ($8 and change). She also got a shit amount of fries and it was all so burnt. She couldn't even chew the chicken strips they were so hard.   One girl appeared and helped him bring food out. She was a total bitch. We asked for silverware and she snapped at us saying we had to hold on. Then she didn't even bring silverware for everyone. We had to share    We brought up our issues to him and he ignored us. He just said want the bill? We got charged and paid for everything even though so much was not edible. He added wrong things to bills and refused to add them to the right places and just told us to pay one another. Again, what?    None of us tipped. We all wanted our change back. I gave him my amount and waited for the change and he wasn't really budging to give it back. So I asked, could I get my change? Again, he snapped back that he needed to wait to get change before he could give change. Someone from my party spoke up saying there's no need to have attitude with us. This was his issue and we, as customers, shouldn't have to hear his back talk.   We also requested he unlock the bathroom doors so we could use the restroom, which he also ignored. Glad we didn't though. It would probably be more to write about here. He was covered in grease, gook, and food and his fingernails were filled with grime. Delicious."}
{"text":"Disrespectful \"owner\" kicks us out immediately upon walking in as a party of six. Meeting a friend of ours we were discussing what we were doing for maybe 60 seconds and we were settling in review the menu to order a number of items to fill all of us up. He's at the bar and says \"hey guys you can't just stand around here if you're not drinking or eating you need to get out.\" We said we haven't even had a chance to look at the menu. He says there's cameras there that will see we are just \"hanging out\" even though we literally arrived for 60 seconds ago. We don't like being talked to like that and walked out of the establishment instantly. No wonder this place has 2 and 1/2 stars. I'm surprised it has any more then 1 Star. Incredibly disrespectful customer service. BEWARE we came in at 2am Sunday April 8th. Who ever was working there is horrible."}
