{"text":"Just had breakfast here was good not overpriced at all. Friendly staff too. What a Cute little go to place in the mornings!"}
{"text":"A terrific spot for Bennie!
Service was fast friendly focused and fun...Benedict was beautifully presented with sliced fruits/berries encompassing delicate and delicious Hollandaise adorned medium cooked eggs on a fresh muffin. The ambiance is that of a nice bistro with high ceilings, a \"foodies\", atmosphere but with a family feel! Fantastic for breakfast....
I discovered on this visit that not all Nellie's' are the same. This was not the rushed standing room only, hurry up and eat  and pay and get out experienced at the 17th Ave Nellie's! It was a nice experience..... but no wonder- it is owned by a family who cares a lot about its clientele...
Go visit. A few more visits will ensure it stays around to show  Nellie how to do this right!"}
{"text":"This was our first Canadian meal. Service did not disappoint. Server was super friendly and attentive, refilling my coffee. My meal was OK (breakfast maple BLT), it seemed like the tomato wasn't ripe enough but the potatoes were great. Fiance liked his meal."}
{"text":"Nellie's is a good spot for efficient breakfast. The diner is low-key, and has a homey feel, but nothing is overly fancy."}
{"text":"A basic breakfast place with decent food and a homey feel. Nothing special, but still good. I had the two eggs breakfast with bacon."}
{"text":"Whoa, Nellie's!

This quaint downtown caf√© looked promising - the customer service is incredibly friendly and accommodating (not to mention possessing a wonderful sense of humour). Unfortunately, it spirals into a tailspin of disappointment when the food is delivered upon your anticipating stomach.

You know the drill (For breakfast, I always order the traditional eggs Benedict). Was it awesomely delicious? Nope. Was it horrendously bad? Kind of, yes. The English muffin was insultingly soggy and the ham was mediocre and salty. What about the Hollandaise sauce, you may ask? Well, it was certainly some type of sauce yet it definitely wasn't Hollandaise. It was a viscous translucent white liquid that was reminiscent of hair gel. It tasted absolutely awful. I would rather squeeze hair gel in my mouth and eat it. Honestly, it was the worst \"Hollandaise\" sauce I have ever had the displeasure of tasting - which is saying something, because Humpty's has a similar Hollandaise sauce and I gave that a score of minus five. This? Easily a negative integer past ten. In addition, the 'fruit' you receive are two hair-thin slices of various melons and one strawberry. The hashbrowns were average, nothing special; no seasoning, no salt and a bit soggy. The only redeeming quality of the dish were the eggs, which were perfectly poached soft as per request. Overall, I was not impressed. I really need to learn how to voice my complaints and concerns to the restaurant staff in person.

I may return for desserts, but the breakfast has left a queasy sensation in the recesses of my subconscious."}
{"text":"Have eaten at many of the Nellie's restaurants and this one has been the worst. Order is rarely cooked properly and dishes are dirty. Won't ever go back to this one."}
{"text":"Excellent Ukrainian and traditional breakfast. The service was good and the food came out quickly. The coffee was even pretty good. It also has a nice cozy atmosphere and thankfully was open on Thanksgiving. The bacon and eggs were done perfectly and the banana pancakes were next level!"}
{"text":"This location is easy to get to, is spacious and not overly crowded. The staff is friendly and accommodating and you are greeted right when you get through the door. I like the ambience and set up of the restaurant, it has a happy-go-lucky diner feel to it. 

I have two favourite dishes there and on both occasions they have been absolutely delicious - the California omelet which is packed with chicken & avocados and a nice side of salsa & sour cream and the Nellie's Oven Melt where you get to choose either tuna, chicken, eggs, or crab. I decided to choose chicken with a side house salad and it was a perfect amount of food for a great brunch. 

If you're willing to pay a few bucks for a good breakfast/brunch this location has it going on."}
