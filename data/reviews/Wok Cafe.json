{"text":"Unfortunately, the Wok Cafe does not stand out with the other asian restaurant nearby. Although service is quick, the food quality is lacking for the price paid. I got wonton soup with curry beef dish. The wonton (pork) soup is not bad, but nothing special. The main course is lacking in flavour. The curry is diluted so much, and the beef lacked any seasoning. The rice tasted reheated (cold in certain sections). The vegetables were okay. Also, the place just feels very dirty, and no one seems to care. My plate was chipped at two corners, and my table still had some sticky spots. Overall, there are some many other alternatives nearby."}
{"text":"Ordered the \"General Tao Chicken\" which came with the rice, vegetables and the choice of either the spring roll or soup, which I chose wonton. The food came quick, but didn't taste too good. Wasn't cooked well. The staff were nice but a bit pushy at the end on tipping them even more money. This place is only good if you're super hungry and willing to eat anything."}
{"text":"Cheap asian food, tastes ok, not the greatest tbh. Fast service, plenty of room to sit, but I would recommend looking elsewhere if you want asian food, plenty of other choices around."}
{"text":"I read the reviews on Yelp just before stepping into this mess of a resto, thinking it can't be that bad, I was really craving asian food after all... I ended up chewing on funny smelling hard beef cuts served with anemic vegetables and the driest, dullest rice I've ever had... I love discovering cheap and good food, but this place has neither. The prices are slightly higher than what you pay for your mall food, and what you get to eat is just unacceptable by any standards."}
{"text":"I went to this place with my dad for lunch on a Wednesday at around 11:30. We both really enjoyed our meals!   I got the Singapoor noodles with shrimp only it was loaded with shrimp, which I was very happy about. The noodles were just the right amount of spicy and they weren't dry like you usually get, they were fresh and you could taste it. Veggies were crunchy and fresh too.  I also tried the shrimp dumplings. Was very satisfied with the filling; you don't get a shrimp puree, you get actual shrimp. The only think I didn't like was that the dough was a bit chewy and there was a lot. Still great dumplings.   The waitress was very nice and helpful. Service was fast; everything we ordered arrived in 5-7 minutes. Water was cold and your glass would be filled up almost every time you took a sip. I saw some reviews about how the staff was rude; I really can't relate!   Overall I'd give this place 4.5 stars. If you're craving Chinese and don't know where to go to eat great, cheap, non-americanized food: this is the place!"}
{"text":"Went there the other day for a take-away,was offended by the arrogant waitress and grumpy boss. felt very uncomfortable when talking to them. Won't go there anymore. What a ridiculous service..."}
{"text":"Avoid this place if you can. Bad customer service, and bad food. Everything doesn't taste fresh, and or is just not cooked as well as other places. This place has become a running joke for my friends and I."}
{"text":"Went here because it was a rainy Tuesday, and Kazu - across the street - was closed.   I usually don't experiment with the food at these types of places, but even the General Tao was iffy, as was the salad it came with - emaciated, thawed leaves served in a watered down sauce of some sort. Terrible.   We didn't leave much of a tip, just whatever change we had left. Our waitress took the tip, gave it a stern look, and promptly threw it on the ground (!!!), yelling, \"No tip!.\"  Yea, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Worse ever no vegetables in soup  Waiter is wack didn't even offer something else for 10$ worse soup ever and he said I'll ad sprouts he added like 10!! Worse place in Montreal honestly   Never go there it's not worth it at all"}
{"text":"Worst food and service ever. The food is pure crap, awful general tao and chowmein. The chowmein was dry and flavorless. Also, the general tao, i have had way better than here, didn't even finish 1 quarter of the rubbish food. The lady who served us was horrible. No smile at all, and worst part during taking our orders she got a phone call and went right away while I was speaking to her about our order, and came back after almost 5mins. Disgustinh."}
{"text":"I dunno who on earth gave them a license for this place. Dirty, dirty, dirty!!!!! I was starving and I happened to pass by there so I went it and ordered shrimp dumplings, while I was waiting I wanted to leave the place bc I couldn't even sit there. tables,chairs, chopsticks, floor literally everything was dirty to the point that I wanted to eat with my hand cuz there was nothing there that was clean! The dumplings were so chewy!"}
{"text":"Heure d'ouverture pratique. On aime ramasser un bon plat sur le chemin du retour de travail.   Très accommodant, même si pas sur le menu, on m'a gentiment fait le délicieux Tofu à l'ananas dont j'avais envie.   Le service n'est pas des plus chaleureux mais ils sont sympathiques et c'est bon. Le seul hic est qu'il semble y avoir un problème avec la ventilation, le restaurant est souvent enfumé. J'y retourne pour les nouilles Singapour et le Tofu Tao.  Aujourd'hui, avec une bonne grippe,  la livraison rapide d'une délicieuse soupe avec dumplings aux arachides est tellement appréciée"}
{"text":"I'm not sure about the other locations but the service at this place is unbelievable our server went from the cash to the phone to mopping the floors then serving our food with out even washing her hands once (EWWW) and this place would need a flood to clean out the mess and lingering dirt . we strolled in the location at 11:15pm (munchies)  and were rushed to make our order and hurry up and eat because  they wanted to close at 12pm.  I'll sum it up like this this is a take out joint because the dieing experience isn't catered in this Wok Cafe.  oh the Pad Thai is out of intergalacticly out of this world and is to die for !"}
{"text":"The prices are relatively low but you definitely get what you pay for. The food is very bland and the beef ribs were extremely dry. There is only one waitress for the whole restaurant so the service is not that quick for a Chinese restaurant.   I would unfortunately not recommend."}
{"text":"Despite the bad reviews below, I've been going there for years and love it! As a student, the price is very reasonable and the plates are huge. I always have a good amount of leftovers that I bring home. The servers aren't the best servers ever, but I've never had a problem with them. They've never been rude with me or i've never felt not welcomed. Whenever i'm downtown and want Chinese food I always go there without hesitation."}
{"text":"On our way to Kanbai we decided to try Wok Cafe instead since we were in the mood to try something different. (We love Kanbai and I highly recommend it for legit Szechuan.)  Where to start with Wok Cafe? Well let's start with the food. It is bland, re-heated or defrosted and will give you stomach pains after a dish or two. The dirty kitchen and floors might be to blame for that or the very low prices which reflect the lack of quality/fresh ingredients being used.  Seriously, I wonder if they would pass a health inspection judging by all the old newspapers on the ground and the moldy floors. It's not a well kept establishment.  The service.. about what we expect from a Chinese restaurant which means basic and quick service, no frills and no smiles. Up to par there until the lady grunted and seemed really unhappy that she was only getting $1 tip on a $30 order. After paying she caught up to my wife to complain and asked for more tip.  Unbelievable but true. Yes we didn't tip well but that's because I was getting sick from their food and barely ate because of it.  Anyway, avoid at all cost. Walk a few more steps, go to Kanbai and enjoy a good meal. Wok Cafe is bad... and dirty.  Food: 1.5 Service: 1.0 Value: 3 toilet flushes"}
{"text":"Ordered the General Tao Tofu... I thought perhaps someone had chopped up a bath sponge and served it too me; , the tofu was boiled (and boiled, and boiled) so it came out full of water; terrible tasting water which diluted the sauce and made it inedible.  Our group had three tofu dishes and they were all equally bad.  They did remove the dish from our bill though.  Two stars based on service alone."}
{"text":"My perspective is from somebody who likes asian cuisine, and Toronto has many of them.  I asked the waiter what he would recommend / if there was something good. The server recommended the combos (which i would describe as, things you offer to non-Asian diners.)  You get a bit of rice, some heated vegetables, and a protein (lemon chicken.)  I added some shrimp dumplings to my order because i was hungry.  My traveling partner ordered a plate of shrimp rice.  Comes in the color brown.  Verdict.  Its Chinese food, a step up from what you would get at a shopping mall.  But if they were good at something, the waiter didn't direct me to order it.  At least they are fast at making the food.  But its nothing to get excited about."}
{"text":"We were a group of four and ordered delivery I ordered the chicken and broccoli and it tasted like I was eating a rubber band. Everyone else said the food tasted the same."}
{"text":"Les dumplings sont frais et délicieux. Mon plat test pour ce type de resto, le cantonese chow-mein est une réussite."}
{"text":"The reason why i have one star was because of their convenient hours.  However, the server pointed to where we should sit and was dismissive. We were there pretty early so I guess the food taking longer than usual to come out was due to the kitchen just opening up.   The food itself, 3 out of the 3 dishes were really bland. I understand everyone has different pallets but all of us (3 people) unanimously agreed on the lack of depth in the food.  Upon checkout another server counted the money in front of us after we told her we were all set. Not the best experience."}
{"text":"yuck! eww! impossible to eat , the soups taste like crap , smells horrible . The sesame beef was purple and impossible to chew! avoid this place! run!"}
{"text":"Don't expect luxury when you walk into this place. It's a small hole in the wall where the waitresses answer their cells while taking your order and give you dirty looks if you stay too long. But for $7 you can have a HUGE plate of really tasty Chow Mein and leave there completely stuffed and ready to take a nap. I enjoy this place. Their general Tao is apparently what they are known for but because I'm not a huge fan of General Tao, I wouldn't know however I've had a few of their dishes and they have all been quite tasty!! If you're in the area, I would definitely suggest dropping in."}
{"text":"Yeah Im usually around this place whenever TM-soup is closed, Food is okay just about whatver you get is what you pay for. Service is fast, food is prompt and thats about it. The whole experience is just walk in get seated right away(assuming no line up rush) eat, and leave. Pretty much so. I only order the regular General Tao as I dont want to experiement much in these places but overlooking the grungy appeal the place is good for a late night snack as most places are closed. I stick to their fried rices and general tao and im good to go. Prices average, a quick hit and run here is about 35-40 tip inclu."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the worst Chinese food I ever ate. I ordered the General Tso and the chicken was very rubbery and didn't taste like chicken. Absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"I guess you get what you pay for. Makes mall food seem like gourmet cuisine. It would be difficult in blind taste test to tell difference between General Tao chicken and sesame beef. Lots of bland sauce."}
{"text":"I got the vegetarian dim sum combo but what I really got was 4 mediocre Americanized dishes. The portions are huge for the price but more comfort food/greasy and not what I was craving or expecting."}
{"text":"En sortant du film Ju-on the last curse à Fantasia j'avais une soudaine envie subliminale de nouilles à l'encre de pieuvre.   J'ai finalement opté pour des dumpling, plus rapide et délcieux comme collation de nuit.  Je suis donc entrée ici par hasard, première vitrine à offrir des dumpling en vrac.    Accueillit avec un magnifique sourire, elle me dit nous fermons, mais puisqu'il y beaucoup de gens encore, entrez,asseyez-vous!  Déjà les ariômes m'enivre et l'ambiance feutrée me plait et me calme afin d'oublier Toshio.  J'ai commandé deux ordres de dumpling à la coriandre et 2 aux crevettes. Quelle délice!  Vraiment frais et à point, servi agréablement et avec les sauces apporter à votre table sans que vous ayez à demander.  Je vais revenir c'est certain essayer leur canard à toute les sauces et les combos de Ramen.  Donc possible mise à jour de l'avis à venir avec un menu plus copieux.  Une belle découverte,  une belle expérience."}
{"text":"This is a typical American Chinese restaurant.  I've ordered a dim sum combo, a Singapore noodle combo and a sesame beef combo. A combo is a choice of soup or spring roll and a main dish with rice or noodle.   There was a hair with my dim sum combo. They've promptly changed the dim sum.   Appetizers came really quick. The hot and sour soup was delicious, I can say the same for the spring roll. Just meh.  The sesame beef is not amazing. A little dry. The Singapore noodles were good and it was a big portion.   I would add that the manager of this place is not really nice. There was even a party of 2 who even decided to leave this place after talking with her.   When we paid, the manager ask us how much we will give tips by typing herself with the machine. This way who can't decide how much we will give. A little cheap attitude, just like this place."}
{"text":"One of the best places for General Tao Chicken. Quick service but unfortunately I felt like the servers were angry at me or something. I don't know what I did to upset them but after eating the general tao chicken I no longer cared or even remembered feeling like that."}
