{"text":"First time trying the restaurant. Their menu is pretty smll and many items were not available even for Sunday lunch time. No dumplings were available, only pork or vegetable buns. 

Price i think its a bit expensive; 13.95 for a beef with pepper dish.

Every table comes with a small dish of seaweed salad and kimchi as starter.
The food is good but slightly salty to my taste. I ordered pork buns, the beef dish, une spring roll and a small rice on the side. We were 3 people and finished eveything.

I will probably return again but the down side is the menu that was not fully complete."}
{"text":"Not worth the price at all. All the dishes are too salty. They made the beef so hard that we can hardly swallow. We told them we didn't want spicy, but they still put too much pepper. In addition, the quantity is so small. This is by no means a northeast China restaurant. So below average!"}
