{"text":"The hotdogs are always bomb. I used to buy one almost everyday after class when he was on Thomas but I still go downtown to get them. The dogs are cheap and always different types with specials everyday. Best hot dog stand downtown!"}
{"text":"Second night in a row that I have hit Yogi's Bistro.  This Hot Dog cart is always outside of the Hyatt Regency in down town Phoenix. Great service and bomb Hot Dogs. Pause!!!!!  

Each time I went I asked the guy working(Lonnie) to just make something good. With no expectations I was pleased each time. He would hook it up with a ton of ingredients and both times it tasted just as good. All and all a good experience at a super cheap price. Hard to get a Hot Dog wrong....reccommended"}
{"text":"Juicy, bursting with flavor, and easily the BEST HOT DOG IN DOWNTOWN PHOENIX!! My hubs and I went to the symphony, starving, desperately looking for a quick bite to eat. Lo and behold, a hot dog stand right in front of the symphony (corner of 1st st and Adams). I wasn't sure he would have anything for me (Damn vegetarians) but he had veggie dogs! We ordered just two hotdogs to satisfy our hunger. He asked me what I wanted, I ended up with a cream cheese, green chile, jalape√±o, and Sriracha hot dog. 

The first bite was nothing short of amazing. I couldn't believe it was a veggie dog. I double checked my husbands just in case. It was the most juiciest, flavor packed hot dog I have ever had. The bun was warm and soft. The whole thing itself was a great value for $4.00 (add 1.50 for drinks and chips). I had to get another one. While I was stuffing my face, people where staring at us like we were savages. Well they are that damn good. You need to try Yogi's. I'm not sure where he'll be at next time, but you bet I'll be driving around and stalking his social media for where he might be at."}
{"text":"I'm visiting downtown Phoenix for a few days. Hotel is close to where I need to visti so i'm carless. I was actually walking to another place for some dinner and wasn't crazy about crossing Central at the Thomas rail station when I saw Yogi's. It's in a nice quiet spot back off the street a bit on the NW side. 
Had a great experience with the owner as well as getting some first class dogs. Will be grabbing food here again before I leave. I recommend exploring the \"Styles\", there are simply too many sauces and topping to list. Safe to say you'll get a dog just about anyway you can imagine. Prices are great."}
