{"text":"Uhhh...this location (hudson drive) has, I believe, closed. Others remain open and are enjoyable places to dine, with large servings of good quality food. Fresh cut fries are great, as is their humongous fish sandwich. Not a special occasion restaurant, but a nice, informal local chain entirely suitable for families."}
{"text":"Went  to Rockne's just the other day
was on my way to Louie's in the falls but couldn't find a place to park and I hadn't been to Rockne's in a 5 years so I thought i would try it
i had a cheese burger with fries and a side of wings
first the wings
don't bother they were soggy and had a breading on them that did nothing for the wing or the flavor
the burger was greasy and again not up to par
the bun was good but i asked for mayo on the side and it came as a individual serving package the food just seemed low grade bar food 
no care in the preparation
the fries were just average and the ice tea weak
Skip It!"}
{"text":"*Location Closed*

picture of For Lease sign uploaded... sent an edit the other day... still not marked closed... lots of other locations in the area still open."}
{"text":"This location is now Beckers...same building, except for the name change out front. Atmosphere of a pub/sports style restuarant still exist as well as menu items. Was like a ghosttown when we went, especially for a Saturdat night with an OSU game on as well. Fries were cold, and waitress continually forgot items we had ordered. Chicken and dumpling soup looked good, but was bad to the taste. Owner was there \"gladhanding\" people as damage control as each time we drive by location less that 10 cars i nthe parking lot. And that is a HUGE decrease as location would be packed for lunch and dinner. My opinion would be to let this location pass you by as you drive by...there is better out there."}
{"text":"This was my favorite Rockne's back in the day.  Very sad it closed because I had lots of fun times and yummy meals here!"}
