{"text":"Went again this past weekend and it's official- I'm in love! Excellent Pad Thai, and their house soups are pretty great too!"}
{"text":"Great service, great atmosphere, delicious food- we got a noodle dish and a curry dish. SO good. Feels very authentic inside and food also tastes very authentic."}
{"text":"I'm sad because this was my favorite Thai restaurant. I took my son there for New Year's day and he got a steamed bug in his food.
The food is excellent and the staff is hit or miss."}
{"text":"We have visited this place now couple of times. The folks are very cheerful here and the wooden sculpture of chain of elephants is cool. On our quest for finding places that offer vegetarian choices, we tried this place. The pretty much make anything vegetarian, by replacing a tofu equivalent, which worked out very well for us. We tried the PadKraPraw with a tofu replacement and this was very flavorful and hit the right taste buds. I am slowly beginning to become a fan of this place."}
{"text":"I've ordered their pad thai for take out a couple of times from this place, but last night was the first night that my husband and I decided to go dine in at this place. It was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!! The service here is HORRIBLE!! 

We went there around 9pm and was the only couple there besides another group at the place. The other group left shortly after we came, but we never got service after we received our food. We never got asked if we needed anything else and received no water refill. They had 6 staff walking around working and doing their own thing and NOT ONE of them ever even stop to come check on us especially our waitress. When we finally got up to leave she was talking out loud from the far back asking us if everything was okay. I wanted to throw a fit and say.. \"no, everything is not okay we got no service!\" 

Aside from the poor customer service; we ordered my favorite dish which was the pad thai. I asked for no onions and bean sprouts, but we still got it with LOTS of big onions and bean sprouts. My husband told me to say something about it; but I figure I would deal w/ it because I'm always iffy about what people do with my food after they take it back and have to fix it for me. It already took about 15 minutes or so for them to bring out the dish and I didn't want to have to wait another 15 minutes. 

We also ordered sticky rice..and I LOVE sticky rice. It took them longer to bring us the sticky rice than the other three dishes that we ordered. The sticky rice was not moist and sticky at all. It was dried and crusty like its been sitting out for too long. I guess they were trying to microwave or steam it before they brought it out, but didn't do a very good job.

We also ordered the green curry dish; that dish cost $13.95 and came in such a small size plate that should have been worth $7 at the most! Big disappointment on that dish. 

So base on my experience last night; I have concluded that I will NEVER go here again nor will I even bother to order take out from this place. Bangkok Ocha down the street is so much better!"}
{"text":"We just had the worst possible experience in a restaurant. We love Thai food and we're looking at places to eat. We thought we found our Thai rest but we were in for a big surprise. We order pad Thai and it was so dry and tasteless. The waitress offered to bring me something else and my husband kept eating even though he hated it. A second waitress offered to bring him something also. I told him to do it. All of a sudden an old man came out of the kitchen yelling at
My husband like he was a child basically saying that he took
More than one
Bite and should not get another dish. We were outraged. How nasty can you get. The waitresses apologized for him but it didn't matter we spent $45 to throw food in the garbage. I would not suggest eating this food. I'm sick to my stomach"}
{"text":"Great food for the price.  I enjoyed their vegetarian options especially the pad Thai. Love the inside. Great service as well."}
{"text":"I love this place! The Pad Thai is amazing but you HAVE to order it with the BROWN sauce..not that red sauce (it's not very good this way.) I like mine just a little spicy at one star but it's perfect every time!! If you were turned off by the Pad Thai...try it this way!! And everything else I've tried from there is great too!!"}
{"text":"Went there for my Birthday along with my friends. We went at 9.30 and they said the last order would be taken by 9.45 . We took quite sometime to decide and they were not polite to watch us scanning the menu.

Food was good, the Rice Wine Saki too was good. Overall food is good and you can go there for a simple evening but don't expect anything special."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  I've been eating here for 5 years and it is consistently good every time.  The one taller young guy is the friendliest guy you'll meet and gets the order right.  The soups are great, the fried rice dishes are great, and the curry dishes are delicious.  Charlotte needs more restaurants like this one."}
{"text":"My husband and I are definitely \"foodies\" and I am particularly snobbish when it comes to Asian food. Sad but true. We frequently eat here! The food is WONDERFUL and the service is great. The people are personable and friendly, atmosphere is very nice (elaborate wood carvings and polished feel). We often eat in, but have frequently taken food home (carryout). 

I will admit the pad thai here is not the best I have had. I actually only ordered it once and then decided I didn't need to do so again. However, I totally crave their Rama of Sunset dish. We have had a number of their other dishes and my husband tends to try something new each time we go. Their Panang curry is also very good but you do have to empathize MILD if you don't like spicy food...

Overall great place and certain dishes I would say rival the best Thai places we have eaten at in NYC and DC (where we have previously lived....)"}
{"text":"I have to say it pains me to give this place a bad rating but I honestly had to. The food here is very good and I will likely come back simply because of that but I will be ordering take out from now on. The reason for this is as follows:

The waitresses at the front of the house are great and very pleasant but the man who runs the food out of the Kitchen into the dining room is very rude and unprofessional. My wife and I ordered and the above mentioned man brought us the wrong dishes. I was not paying attention (and honestly had a hard time understanding what he said) but when he aggressively belted out what I assume was the name of the dish he delivered out loud I nodded and he set it down. It was only when I looked up at my wife's plate did I notice that he had brought another table's food to our table. Normally not a big deal but he scolded me for nodding my head earlier and said \"so why did you say it was yours if it wasn't? He then proceeded to scold the next table because they didn't recognize the dishes immediately when he brought them by either. The table tried to smooth things over by making a joke but he immediately threw that back in their face too. 

It didn't stop here either, when he finally did bring us our food he set it down in front of my wife and barked out \"Is this right? Make sure because I don't want to have to come back again.\" As if that wasn't enough he then scolded another table because they asked for a dish without onions and he brought it with onions and they called him on it. 

I have a suggestion for you, Thai House - keep that man in the back where he isn't around people because he has absolutely no people skills and you will continue to lose customers because of his bad attitude. Most people don't complain about things like this. They just don't come back."}
{"text":"I hope that this review does not get filtered, as I am a fan of this restaurant. It is quick, so I can get in and out for lunch, the prices are good, and the food is really delicious. Staff is efficient and friendly. The parking is never bad which is nice when you are trying to be quick."}
{"text":"Incredible consistent Thai food.  Authentic as far as I can tell.  Great Thai Tea.  A must eat charlotte place for sure."}
{"text":"Love this place. My family has been going here for the past several years. My kids love it. They love the Thai House Soup as an appetizer. My wife and I always get Thai Iced Tea. Fried Rice is amazing. Always cooked perfectly. I have not had a Main Dish that I wasn't happy with. Decor is beautiful inside. Lots of ornate wood carvings. Staff is also great. Most I assume are native to Thailand."}
{"text":"I get thai food attacks frequently, and sadly most of the time, I walk away thinking.... meh, almost. Not so at Thai House. 

I can tell you in all honesty that this is the BEST thai food I have EVER had in my LIFE. I'm apparently not alone in experiencing this, because right on the wall above the register is a sign that tells you it won something ridiculous like 100 best restaurants in America. Or something like that. I don't doubt it one bit. 

The outside facade is unassuming. I was blown away when I walked in by the intricate and beautiful wood carvings that cover the restaurant. 

The service is impeccable, the food is to die for, I debated even writing this review because I felt like this place is a secret (MINE!) but Thai House doesn't deserve it. So, I'm yelping it from the rooftop! (Ha.) THIS IS THE BEST THAI FOOD I'VE EVER HAD. 

Great (the best) food, fantastic service, and a gorgeous dining environment. Trifecta.

When that craving hits, get in your car and immediately go to this place. You're welcome."}
{"text":"We really like this place.

I think it's not only the best Thai food I have had here in Charlotte, but I also find that it's better than most Thai restaurants I experience when I travel (so far there is only one place I found that's better, but it's in Petaluma, CA... so bit of a drive for a quick dinner ;-)

I have tried numerous items on their menu and have never been disappointed.

Service has always been friendly and prompt. 

This will continue to be our \"go-to\" Thai in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Hidden gem !!!
Authentic, authentic, authentic !!!
Masaman curry is awesome
Staff very nice, attentive.  Carved woodwork decor is one of a kind."}
{"text":"I had chicken Pad Thai, it was nice.  It would have been excellent if they had put more spicy as i've ordered for 5 star spice.  However, food was good, good ambiance. I would suggest for dine-in."}
{"text":"I can't figure our why this place doesn't get a better rating. First of all it's a knockout to look at. Someone went to a lot of expense to make this place look like a Thai restaurant and it shows. Food was good, spicy and different. We had softshelled crabs, They were outstanding. All the tastes were unique. Perfect of course not. We needed bigger spoons to get the sauce onto the rice. The fried tofu was a little bland. Otherwise the food was good. The service was just right. (I hate it when the new waiter at Applebees asks you 9 times mid bite how your burger is) The ambiance is more than pleasant. Thai House is a great stop on a weeknight when you want Thai food and a bit of a treat. Overall, my new go too place for Thai."}
{"text":"Not good.  Monsoon beats this  place X ten.  Phad thai like mush.  Bland.  Doesn't look or taste like it was prepared by Thai cooks."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the best I have ever been to the staff where wonderful and polite the food was fantastic I would recommend this place as a must if you are ever in Charlotte"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Thai restaurant!! They have the best spring rolls and the best Pad Thai. The service is excellent and always consistent. I can never get enough of the jasmine tea!!"}
{"text":"Better than most of the other area Thai restaurants in my opinion. 

Really Good: jasmine tea, spring rolls, pad Thai, Kai Cashew.
Service has always been good. 

Wood carvings alone are worth the trip. 

Whenever we're in the area, we always try to plan to eat here."}
{"text":"I've been going to the Thai House about once a month for over a year now. I love it! I've tried a number of other Thai restaurants in the area and this is my favorite.

I often bring friends and no one has ever disliked their meal here. My favorite things to get are the Pho and the Green Curry (which is really spicy). The food is always great. 

The service is even better than the food. They are always prompt and friendly. Most times I am surprised at how fast the food comes out. After going here a while they treat you like family. I would definitely recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"Rude staff, tried to take away the menu before I finished ordering. Asked for desert and gave us the check instead.

Food is nothing special. Had better Thai food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for lunch! Their lunch prices and portions are the best!

-First you get some type of soup...they change it every day. We had some type of rice and chicken. It is always broth based.
-I ordered the Red Curry Chicken dish. The curry sauce was nice and watery with a creamy cocounut taste. Pour the bowl of chicken and red curry over the rice and then enjoy! The small spring roll was a nice little touch and very good!

They are quick serving and are a great lunch spot option!"}
{"text":"Had a very disappointing experience with takeout this evening. Called placed order 20 minutes prior to arrival. Upon arrival, cashier confirmed the order and had me pay for the food. She said food would be right out. I waited 15 minutes and no food arrived. Other take out customers came, picked up three orders and left. No update in my food was given. Went to the hostess desk to inquire but no one present. Finally a harried waitress came to the desk and I asked her to please check on my food since I had been waiting. She scurried off but did not return with food nor information. Hostess finally returns and says  my food would be ready in an additional 15 minutes. Says kitchen mixed up my order. I finally asked for a refund and left."}
{"text":"Very charming atmosphere and the food was delicious, authentic and satisfying. I appreciated seeing a diverse crowd of people patronizing this store. I'm a white American myself but Ive learned that whenever eating at an ethic restaurants if you don't see any other ethnicities dining at that location - they are most likely only catering to the stereotypical bland palate of the American people and essentially you are not going to be served anything close to authentic food!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. Lovely decor, great selection of Thai dishes which are well executed. Quick service and fair pricing. They are nicely considerate of those who like the flavour but can't handle the spice."}
{"text":"This used to be our go-to place for Thai, eating there t least twice a month. But over the past year, the quality of food has declined. Not just the entrees -- even the previously CRAZY GOOD dipping sauce for spring rolls has declined.  My heart is still with them, but I only go here once in a while now given the change.  I sincerely hope they return to their better days, as there is new competition in S Chl now."}
{"text":"Excellent family run business, great atmosphere and most important, FANTASTIC food.

(P.s the pad Thai is da bomb!)"}
{"text":"Thai House was my favorite Thai restaurant in Charlotte. Their food is fresh, spiced to order, and delicious. Portions are huge, so I always had leftovers for lunch the next day. Try the spring rolls- delicious! 

The decor in Thai House is beautiful, and the waitstaff wear traditional dress. They are friendly and attentive, and I always enjoyed my meals here. They occasionally offer promotions in the area, which are a great way to save some money. They also have a weekend lunch menu that features some of their classics at a great price. 

I would recommend Thai house to anyone who loves Thai, or those who want to try!"}
{"text":"Beautiful surroundings and decor, friendly and attentive servers, kind management, and very good food.

Spring rolls were good sized and flavorful... a bit on the greasy side (as they usually are anywhere you fo.) Rice soup with chicken was delicious and plentiful. Thai Iced Tea was just right. 

Really great Thai place.

My mom (a true southern belle raised on southern cookin') eats there often, which speaks volumes. I recommend it.

* Note: This review is based solely on one visit and then items we ate then.*"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Great service and the yellow chicken curry is perfect every time. We love their fried strips of chicken to dip in curry sauce. Duck is amazing and the pat-see-yew is always good"}
{"text":"Look, if you want good Thai food.... well look no more!
This is the place. Been here approximately 5x's and every time I got something different on the menu. 
How bout everything is really good.
I recommend this place to YOU. Hits my spot!
The waitresses are super nice and attentive. 
So many restaurant in this plaza but hands down this is the best in the Charlotte area!!! 
And don't forget your glass of Thai Tea!!! So good!!!"}
{"text":"Below average and I will not return. The shrimp in two dishes did not taste fresh and were not deveined. I got 4 items: knock out rolls made with shrimp (instead of tofu) (shrimp not good), pot stickers (too salty in the interior with very little filling), chicken pad thai (not bad but definitely below average compared to other Thai places I've been to, and the worst of the dishes the shrimp fried rice (the bad tasting shrimp ruined the dish entirely, and no egg was in the rice as it states it should be in there on the menu).  I threw out the rice but was able to eat the remaining items."}
{"text":"This place is authentic.  I loved it. As a person who has been all over the world and had authentic flavors from several countries, this place took me back. It is nice to have a restaurant that makes and prepares their food in house."}
{"text":"Exquisite. Beautiful interior, excellent food, and friendly service. Coconut curry shrimp was outstanding. Go. Go now."}
{"text":"Two things hit me when I walked in here.  The decor and the delicious smell.  First off the elaborate wood carvings and other ornate decorations really set the mood for a good meal.  Then there was the food itself.  It was actually pretty good, even though I'm not usually a big fan of food with a lot of spice. But if that's your thing go for it.  I had a lot of fun here, and I'll certainly be back to try some more."}
{"text":"Best thai I've ate in a long time."}
{"text":"Fabulous consistent meals! I adore their pad thai whether chicken, shrimp or pork, and 
the pad (basil noodles), is what I call it because I do not know the thai name, which are a wide noodle dish with a nutty basil sauce that is delish! Their spring rolls are fabulous too."}
{"text":"We ordered Tom Kha Gah (soup) and Drunken noodle. The drunken noodle wasn't spicy at all and the soup didn't have any Thai curry in it (it was completely white with no orange tint). Disappointing because we were looking for a good Thai place in Charlotte. The atmosphere was nice but the food was just okay. Very little chicken in both the soup and the Drunken Noodle."}
{"text":"We have been going to Thai House since we moved to the area and I'd say it's the best Asian restaurant in Charlotte for a number of reasons. 

Lets start with service. Thai House consistently provides me with amazing service. From their manager to their wait staff they are the most courteous and helpful people. Always nice, well mannered, and gracious. 

Their food is top notch. Hands down best Thai food I've tasted. I have never had a problem with their food tasting any different no matter the time or day of arrival. Take out or dine in it's the same great food experience. I will say that the menu is a bit pricy but real talk you get a ton of food so no complaints from me there. 

Overall unbeatable food and service make Thai House a must-try if you haven't already."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite thai restaurants. Best pad thai in town. The food and service is always great and they have huge portions. I am a big fan of art and mainly oriental artwork and this place is full of it. The wood work in this place is unreal. Even if you do not like Thai and appreciate good artwork I would strongly recommend going into this restaurant and checking it out."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre and service was lacking
The old man waiter in his 60's (maybe) was downright rude"}
{"text":"I was actually looking for Viet Thai, but it is hidden and came across Thai House in Pineville, NC.  Good luck on my part.  Authenic decor, friendly service and great food.  My Tom Yum shripm soup had four large shrimp, peeled to the tail.  The chicken panang curry was flavorful and spicy withou adding spices.  I tried Chang beer instead of my usual Singha...not as good IMHO, but OK.  There are 5-6 choices for Thai in the Pineville area and Thai House is a good one.  Check it out.  Pat"}
{"text":"By far the best Thai food in Charlotte. We drive all the way from Uptown just to eat here since there is absolutely no good Thai in Uptown. Our go to dishes are the obvious Pad Thai, Green Curry, and Red Curry. Highly suggest you try it and don't forget the Mango Sticky rice at the end."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai I've had in Charlotte. It's a nice, quiet place to go after work, the food is always fresh and the staff is very friendly. Great pad thai and green beans and tofu!"}
{"text":"In the area looking for a new place to try and picked Thai House. Don't let the strip mall front put you off...the detailed woodwork inside is fabulous and it's a great date night spot. We arrived on Saturday at 6:45 pm and were seated right away.

We started with my favorite Thai appetizer, chicken satay. The chicken was good, the peanut sauce, sadly, not so much. The flavor was a distant place from many others I have loved before. The accompanying cucumber,  red slice onions and carrots salad was good, but nothing special either. I would try something else next time for sure 

I ordered red chicken curry and asked for a tad spicier and boy was it. Not \"too spicy to eat it\" spicy,  but certainly cleared my sinuses and keep the water coming spicy. I would get it again at the regular spice level. Hubby ordered Thai roasted chicken and liked it very much. He said the sauce was sweet and sour like with a kick of chili spice. It was quite a bit of chicken for the money!

We topped it off with some mango sticky rice which was good but not close to another Charlotte location that I definitely prefer. It's served on this heated stone ware bowl platter that was perfect for date night dessert. At $42.00 for an appetizer, 2 entrees and desserts,  we'll worth the money and I brought home at least a meals worth of leftover. 

The waitstaff work together to take care of customers, and aside from one lady, we're all super friendly,  the last was just not personable despite my efforts to be super friendly back. Otherwise, I was very pleased with my service! 

We will certainly be back to try some other items,  maybe try to come at lunch and enjoy some of the specials!"}
{"text":"Good ambience and good food. Have tried the green curry and a couple noodle dishes and they've all been good.

Can't go wrong here if you've got a Thai craving."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere, the decor, the service and the food! Charlene had the Green Curry with chicken - medium spicy, and I had Basil Fried Rice with beef - 4 spicy on a scale of 5. We are very happy with our entire experience, and it was about as good as we've had in our favorite places in So. California. You want good Thai and a great authentic atmosphere- come eat here!"}
{"text":"This place likes to rob money, every time I come in they charge me a different price...and the lady up front expected a tip..sorry the food is okay but not the service"}
{"text":"Great food for over 20 years. Never had a bad meal. Can't miss for good Thai food. They will make it hot if you ask."}
{"text":"Great. I always order the tom yum soup. If you like cilantro and lime, this is for you. You can also add your choice of protein. The panang chicken curry is also a favorite. It is a light and creamy tomato base curry. I order it with the white rice. Going to try the hot pot next. Lots of vegetarian options as well for those who like tofu etc. If you have an allergy to nuts I would recommend reading the menu carefully and talking with the staff. The sweet tea is also not southern. It is made from jasmine tea which I found bitter."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, service was good and friendly, however, food was just ok. Had Red Curry and Pad Thai lunch special. Asked for spicy and neither was spicy, maybe they didn't think we could handle it (happens more than you think), pad Thai had a weird ketchup-y aftertaste. Soup served with lunch specials was not vegetarian (NBD, but they didn't offer any other options when we asked.) Great price though, we may give it another shot."}
{"text":"I picked up take out for lunch on the way back to the office after an appointment today.  They are really fast with take out orders and my food was ready in under 15 minutes.  Instead of just getting an entree which I would normally do, today I splurged  and ordered a side of Spring Rolls and also a Thai Iced Tea - which is jasmine tea with cream and  sugar served over ice (so good, it tasted like dessert!).  
 
I haven't had Pad Thai in a super long time so I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai.  Theirs is made the traditional way - rice noodles sautéed with beansprouts, onion, egg, ground peanuts and Thai spices.  I asked for \"medium spice\" but this one was not spicy at all. (Thankfully, I keep red pepper flakes at work, so I was able to spice it up to my preference.) 

The lunch entree comes with a vegetarian spring roll which is quite small but tasty.  The side order of spring rolls I got today are with chicken and a larger than the vegetarian version. Both were good though!  

My total bill came to just over $11 (which is more than I normally spend on lunch) but I definitely have enough food for 2 meals, so I have yummy left-overs to look forward to tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Decent Thai food and decent service.  The inside of the restaurant feels \"more Thai\" than other places I've been to in Charlotte with a more traditional feel.  I dig the dude in the front with the MC hammer pants in purple seating everyone.  That was pretty fun.  I actually went for pho, which is actually Viet and not Thai and was pretty pleased with it.

The prices are a bit steep I feel considering the location and the portions, but can still find a few decent dishes for just under $10.  I wouldn't plan to go out of my way for this, but since I frequent Pineville often, I wouldn't be surprised to find myself back there again in a few months."}
{"text":"My very first time having Thai cuisine. While the appearance was quite pleasing, it was a tad more sweet than what I thought a Pad Thai with chicken would taste like! I added a teaspoon of \"red hot sauce\" from the squeeze container and mixed it all around in my food. It did help some and took a little of the sweetness away. My husband and I ordered coffee...thinking it would be regular hot coffee with cream, instead it was Thai coffee, an iced coffee that was really good. Another first for us!

Atmosphere was very nice with the soft Thai music. It was easy to hold a conversation at the table.The portions were good size and we were stuffed when finished.  The service was really good and we will be back but next time I think I'll try something less sweet!"}
{"text":"Had couples dance lessons across the street great idea to give this place a try. I was VERY impressed. Service and food great. I am not a super big curry person but I will be now. I had a very common dish. Can't remember the name.  It had noodles and bean sprouts, I had 3 star spicy, could have gotten a little more spicy. Nice authentic environment."}
{"text":"There is typically never a day where I'm not in the mood for some Pho. Especially with the onslaught of colder climes, Thai is my go-to for all things noodly and soupy. Thus, Thai House off of 51 has popped up on our radar a few times and we finally made it in this week to check out the fare. I'm happy to say, I'll likely become a regular. 

Started with the \"knock out rolls.\" Standard rice paper rolls with vermicelli rice noodles, tofu, cilantro, carrots and cucumber. The hoisin peanut sauce wasn't my favorite, but was reminiscent of other Thai places I've been to. These suckers were huge, too. Much bigger than your typical rice paper roll and the wrapper was a little more al dente, which I enjoyed. 

The Pho....just perfect. All of the standard fixin's and just right. Perfect for the colder air that has abounded as of late. 

My wife ordered the pineapple curry. Man, this was incredible. Coconut-y, creamy, with chunks of pineapple and great pieces of pan-fried tofu. Served with white rice. The flavors were so complex that each bite had a little more creamy, coconut flavor, or chili spice, pineapple and other spices. So creative and good. 

The service is stellar. So friendly and attentive. Your water cup will never be empty. 

Also, an element I typically don't comment on, the decor is phenomenal. Rather intricate and intriguing. 

I'm looking forward to frequenting this place for many a dinner visit to come. Lunch is next!"}
{"text":"My first time at this place and considering it was a thai restaurant, I ordered a beef pad thai. Before I approached the restaurant, I was reading other yelp reviews and came across a few negative reviews, claiming that the pad thai tasted like watered down ketchup. Feeling optimistic, I neglected those reviews and ordered it anyways. When the dish arrived, it was red, I thought this was very odd considering most pad thai that I've seen are brown. I gave it a try and I was really disappointed. It tasted exactly like watered down ketchup. At my table, there were 7 of us and 4 of us ordered pad thai. All 4 of us were really disappointed and left majority of our plates untouched. However, we had the papaya salad as an appetizer and that was great. For dessert, I ordered the mango sticky rice and we all shared it. 

Take away: I wouldn't order the pad thai anymore. Service was friendly, overall decent. Papaya salad was fantastic and so was the mango sticky rice."}
{"text":"I would give them five for great customer service and the awesome food!! If you love Thai food then this is a must try. Me and my sister when on Saturday evening to have lunch there and it was amazing. My sister order a dish and then figured that it was to spicy and she cant eat it. When our waitress came to check we told her that it was to spicy. They took her dish and made her a  new one.. Really it wasn't there fault cause my sister should have read the ingredients but it was very nice of them to do that.."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in the food that had previously been decent. My noodle dish was suppose to be drunken noodle but the sauce tasted like watered down ketchup. I barely ate it and they asked if I wanted a to go box. I told them it did not taste good. Response was \"oh, you like the \"authentic type, we make it regular for the locals who like this flavor but next time you come ask for the authentic.\" Seriously!!  No offer to change it, comp it. They even skimped on the tofu. It seems to be liked by the locals which is unfortunate because it tastes nothing like what its suppose to. To each its own, but I dont like the fact that they didnt try to rectify the crap they gave me. Nothing. I wont come back."}
{"text":"Are you kidding? Eat here! 

I have been a fan of the Indian restaurant next door for a while, but today I just thought I'd try this place.  A lovely find!

Their steamed spring rolls are definitely different from what you expect- not bad- just different. I've had a lot of Thai and this is a unique take for sure. Peppery, and nice.

I got a yellow curry- it's exactly what it should be- fresh, spicy, a little sweet, and tasty. Not a ton of food, but just enough. It was delightful.

At this price point it's hard to beat this place. Some places will serve you beautiful dishes with orchids on the plate etc, but this place just serves the tasty meal (without the orchid, without having to break into the kid's college fund).

Yep. Do it."}
{"text":"For the last few years Thai House has been a staple in my lunch rotation offering delicious and affordable large serving lunch options that have never disappointed. The interior also has a ton of hand-carved wood decorations and siding which make it a neat place to grab lunches for work meetings and large crowds alike. 

Not familiar with Thai and don't want to look like an amateur? I would recommend these simple tips:
 - Thursday is egg drop soup day, which is the best IMO.
 - Ask for the chili paste to add some heat to your meal.
 - Order the lunch menu by number. L5 (pad thai) and L7 (red curry) are my favorites. 
 - you can rate the heat of your dish on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. However, in my experience these are much like the points on \"Whose Line\": made up and don't really matter. Whatever the chef is cooking is what he is going to give you. Also I'm convinced that my pasty white complexion helps to tone down the amount of heat in my order. 

While I haven't tried this place for dinner, I would imagine the servings are a bit larger and cost a bit more."}
{"text":"I lunch there a few weeks ago and enjoyed it so we decided to try dinner  last night.  We were impressed with the fast and attentive service, the authentic clothing the waitstaff wears and the food.  YUM!  We began with the chicken Satay as an appetizer, so tender and yummy, Gulf of Siam with shrimp as the main course. Lots of delicious flavors, very appealing to the eye and the rice was perfect.  Of course we had warm Sake.  A little pricey, good parking, I will be back."}
{"text":"My favorite place of all time!! Great price for lunch specials!! My favorite dish here is red curry. Yum!"}
{"text":"It's a decent restaurant with some delicate decoration. Dined in twice and both were pretty good. Helpful server with abundant food knowledge. Recommend to anyone who likes Thai."}
{"text":"Love me some Thai house mmmm mmmm mmmmmmm and their staff is sweet they even have Apple Pay so who cares if you forget your wallet!!!"}
{"text":"There are a couple of amazing wood sculptures in the place.  The food however, is not as noteable.

The food is average or typical of Thai cuisine.  The dishes are standard and taste and look like what thai food should, however, nothing stood out as being anything more than average.  I am wondering if I am being to critical and if yelp should have 2 rating systems.  1 rating for how a place might compare against local establishments, and another rating for the restaurant nationally.

With that in mind, of the 2 places in Charlotte I have tried for thai, this is clearly the better."}
{"text":"This was my first visit. The atmosphere is warm and exhibits Thai culture with statues and various designs. The staff was friendly and accommodating. I tried the spring rolls as an appetizer. They were ok. There were a couple of over fried pieces that I had to dig out of my molars. My entree was very pleasing to my palate. I chose the Red Curry dish with Shrimp. When I first put the spoonful of sticky rice and red curry concoction in my mouth I thought steam was going to come through my ears. I then had to pull it together or I was for sure going to choke on the spicy delicious bowl of yummy goodness before me. I braced myself and went in! I recommend that you try the Red Curry dish. The shrimp was a very good addition. My total came to $22 for the entire dinner meal Portion."}
{"text":"The food seemed very authentic, hard to find thai food as good as in Thailand but for Charlotte this is very good. Reasonable lunch prices and great thai tea :)"}
{"text":"Decent pad saw ew. Water and Jasmine tea are excellent. Will be back again to try some other dishes. Clean and moderate noise level. Attentive staff and great service."}
{"text":"I have alway love love the food here. You want Thai food. This is place to go too. Straight forward. No sushi or Chinese dishes. 2 of my favorite dishes 

1) yellow curry with coconut milk, potatoes, onions and peanuts with chicken. I never get it spicy. Very creamy and filling. 
2) the pineapple fries with the Chinese sausages. This is THE ONLY place that offered Chinese  sausages. Something I grew eating and it's perfect with fried rice. Of course, pork and pineapple goes well with each other! 
3) there special iced Thai Coffee. Coffee, cream and sugar. I'm not sure if it's special coffee but it's close to Vietnamese coffee. Not as strong tho. 

I took the one star away because of the customer service. Every time I come, it's alway something. She got the order wrong. They charge us wrong. Asked the wrong question,, I just wish they pay a little more to the details!!"}
{"text":"Tonight we ordered take-out... my husband ordered- veggie red curry and I ordered Massaman curry with chicken (substituted potatoes with more veggies). Both of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals! My Massaman curry had just the right amount of sweet and spicy! My husband said the smoky/spicy balance was just right in his red curry as well. Neither one of us are big rice eaters (watching our carbs) but we both continued to eat rice with sauce, after the veggies and protein were gone, JUST to keep the flavor in our mouths..."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to The Thai House and although I don't remember the particulars of the first visit, this time was not as good. The food was average and the spicy dish I ordered was not spicy at all. The restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived. We had good drinks and was promptly served. Our meals arrived with correct temperature and quickly. It was not a bad experience but definitely nothing to write home about. We ordered appetizer, entree and disappointed that we could not get specialty rice. I picked out the meat and left most of the veggies in sauce on my plate-refusing to take it home. Fried items seem to be better prepared. My experience with Thai food is more thinner sauc bases but my entree was thick. We've discovered some better eating(s) in the area so this place probably won't see us for a while."}
{"text":"This is my probably favorite place. I love the waitress here.. they are so friendly.. definitely suggested..."}
{"text":"Dropped in famished for lunch after a hectic hospital spree. I didnt know X-rays can push the 'hunger' button so hard! Anyway, this time and many times in the future, my lovely momma has been and will be my lunch/dinner buddy! My other buddy (best friend, little sister) took off to Texas, where everything is bigger, including the club I have ready to club her down for deserting me here in Charlotte :(  Ohhh Lord, I digress......

Anyway, the lunch is served with a soup which is always delicious. Very watery but rich in flavor. Full of cabbahe and tofu the day I went (it changes sometimes) The entree also comes with a spring roll which isnt of the kind that leaves an entire sip of oil in your mouth ......ughhh.
We ordered 1 entree and a Pad Thai that almost went entirely into a doggy bag! It was either too much food or small apetites run in the fam? Since we shared the shrimp entree, which was chockfull of veggies like zucchini, carrots, red peppers and a scant amount of almost raw brocolli, we ended up having to get an extra small side of jasmine rice. Its so yummy and sweet and delicious!

Overall, good service, good food, good portion, and wonderful iced Jasmin tea. I likey :)"}
{"text":"Okay so I've eaten here a few times now and I feel it's time to review.  I'm not a fan really. Every food experience I've had here has been mediocre, It's kind of like delivery Chinese food but Thai.  

Now to describe my experience today... I ordered takeout for lunch as I was in a hurry to get back to the office.  Normally I would have ordered from another Thai restaurant around the corner but they seemed to be closed. So I decided to try Thai House again as my craving was strong. I seriously want to like this place but my pad see ew was just not very good. It was over cooked, hardly any vegetables at all, and I asked for spicy and there was no heat to my dish. The lunch special comes with a spring roll, well it was more like half a spring roll haha. Which that was the least of my worries but it wasn't any good. It's supposed to have chicken, clear noodles, and mixed vegetables. It had what looked like bok choy and that was it!!  

I have some friends who like this place and I've had good that was good but  nothing special here. Essentially for me, it's like fast food quality.  I don't like giving poor reviews especially when the people there seem fairly nice, if a little out of it, but I just don't think I'll be back again!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to grab some spicy, or not so spicy, Thai food. Sometimes service is slow or not so attentive, but I have never been in a hurry while there anyway. so not a huge deal. I always look forward to the Namprigpaow or Red Curry. If you do the tofu instead of meat, you get veggies like broccoli with your meal. I think the tofu is better than the other protein here.I prefer going for lunch since dinner is about the same portion and costs significantly more. Gotta try the Knock Out Rolls which are an appetizer; fresh roll, vegetables, basil leaves and tofu wrapped in rice sheets and served with plum sauce. So refreshing."}
{"text":"We love walking into Thai House where friendly staff always greets you with a smile. Their authentic delicious food is full of flavors that bring memories back from the time when we visited Thailand. Thai House homemade clear noodle soup is my must have, especially on a chilly winters evening."}
{"text":"A great staple Thai restaurant here in Charlotte! Been coming here consistently for years and it never disappoints. From the great decor and atmosphere to the attentive and friendly staff, I have never had a bad experience here. Service is always very quick and the food is incredibly fresh. I've visited as a vegan, vegetarian, and omnivore and have always enjoyed my meal. I was a little sad to see it so empty on a Friday night.

Tonight, I had vegetarian pad thai with extra veggies (clearly feeling the vegetarian side tonight). It was just as good as I remembered, except perhaps a little bit sweet. If I had to be critical, I'd say the sauce was a little too much and too sweet - almost like pad thai sauce from a jar. But still delicious and I enjoyed it! I visited with my father and his girlfriend, who ordered the panang curry with duck and sweet chili chicken and veggies, respectively. They both enjoyed their meals very much! 

With multiple locations in the CLT area, you should find a Thai House and go ASAP. Nom."}
{"text":"My new favorite Thai place. The decor inside is beautiful. It is filled with hand carved wood panels. We went for the lunch special. The lunch specials come with spring roll, chicken rice soup, and rice unless you get a noodle dish. We both ordered the pad Thai - one American style and one traditional Thai style. Honestly the American one is too sweet. The Thai style is delicious. Would definitely get that again. We also saw some fried rice that looked really good so might try that next time. I've also read good things about the mango sticky rice. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice place for lunch or dinner.  Traditional Thai foods and there are some non-Thai items available on the menu.  We think that this and another Thai restaurant further north on Hwy 521 are the best in the Charlotte area.  Thai House at Tower Place has been consistently selected regularly for recognition in the various people choice endeavors.  Newspaper reviews are posted highlighting what you will experience when you come here to eat.

Service is fast and well done.  You can make adjustments to your meals as to components and degree of spice.  Remember that Thai food is normally spicy hot.  Ask your server and they will guide you on a scale of heat that will satisfy you.  Prices are very reasonable, especially at lunch times.

The lunch menu has some quick items and a good selection so if you are rushed, you can sit, eat and get out quickly.

The decorations are interesting and pleasing.  Very Thai with lots of wood carvings and, as the restaurant is named Thai House...there is a carved wooden Thai House in a large display case.  Children will enjoy finding things in it.  Ask the waiter or look at the sign asking where are the birds, turtles, etc. in the multiple carvings.

Very relaxing for dinners and a great date place."}
{"text":"Food, ambiance, and staff are awesome. This place has the most interesting eating space of any restaurant in Charlotte. It's full of incredibly ornate wood carvings and transports you straight to Thailand.  Everything I've had here has been of exceptional quality and flavor."}
{"text":"Hubby loves this place...I however do not really care too much for it. The curries are too sweet and their stirfry's are always packed with too much cabbage! and I mean raw cabbage. I also don't understand how they expect us to eat dry stirfry with rice.  We eat here if hubby has serious thai food hankering and I have decided to stick with their noodles which are actually decent."}
{"text":"Not bad for Thai food if your in the area. Offers decent lunch specials that include soup, a spring roll and a drink for usually under $10. Dinners can get a bit pricey. The duck panang is my fave thing on the menu. Its a solid curry dish with tender duck  breaded and deep fried. Not my #1 duck panang but it was my first so gotta give them credit for that. It is pretty good. The house salad makes for a great cheap lunch. Its $5.50 for fresh lettuce, bean sprouts, chunks of pineapple, fried tofu, tomatoes and onions. Served with a spice/sweet/peanut/ginger dressing. YUM. Also the spring rolls are  delicious. I've eaten in and grabbed to-go numerous times over the years and service is always acceptable. When i have gone with others everyone in the party seems to enjoy their food. Overall an A-ok place to eat."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in a Pineville small business area with auto shops, grocery stores etc. It's a little hard to find if you're not looking for it. The service is awesome here. The owners take the time to make the experience personable and enjoyable for the customer. The food is good and comes out quick if you're ordering in and they have an expansive list of teas they offer."}
{"text":"I am 8.5 months pregnant and ordered green curry for take out from here. When I placed the order, I emphasized I wanted MILD curry since spicy food has given me horrible heartburn during pregnancy. But, when I got the food home, the curry was so spicy I could not take more than two bites. Secondly, it was not that great. It was mediocre curry at best. So, goodbye $13 curry. Thanks for making the food too spicy for me to eat.  What the heck!?"}
{"text":"I had a really negative experience ordering takeout from here. I often order Pad Thai from restaurants I haven't tried before because I feel like it gives a gauge of what to expect from the place. Well I placed an order to go and showed the coupon I received in a mail flyer. When my food was ready, a lesser discount was applied to my bill. I questioned why they wouldn't honor the coupon I brought in, but they said that it doesn't apply to takeout orders. This wasn't printed on the coupon (though others were marked dine-in only) and the difference was about $1.50.  I'm not sure why they didn't tell me this upfront but I let it go and took my food. 

The Pad Thai itself was really disappointing. The noodles were so over-cooked that they were falling apart into tiny pieces. There was also something in the dish was that gave it a dominating burned flavor. I ate about a third of it and threw the rest away. Overall, my experience here was poor on all fronts and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Have eaten here regularly for 15 years and have never been disappointed. Don't comprehend how anyone could give less than a four star rating. Food is always artfully prepared, fresh and hot. Service is consistently friendly and efficient. Atmosphere is elegant yet comfortable.

Regarding the food... skip the salad and start with a delicious soup, which is a must, whether you go with the savory coconut based Tom Kha or the slightly spicy Tom Yum. As far as appetizers go, you can't go wrong with any of the dumplings (but if you must choose, go with the soup!)

My favorite entree is the Namprigpaow with chicken or crispy duck. Both come in a light brown sauce with perfectly prepared veggies served with brown rice and the best spring roll in town. If you prefer noodles, the Pad See Ew is an excellent choice but, be warned, it is addictive. The pineapple fried rice is also fantastic.

For dessert, try the mango and sticky rice ('cause it's the only one they offer and it just happens to be tasty and enough for two). 

Again I love this place! (Did I mention the soup?) Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Nice Atmosphere, Delicious Thai Food. I am picky when it comes to Thai food but this place is awesome. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times this week and really love the fresh flavorful dishes!
The food is delicious and the staff is so friendly...
I'm going to miss this place when I have to fly home."}
{"text":"The urge to consume Thai food has hit once again and once again we are back at Thai House. Though it was crowded tonight we were given a booth right away. I've ordered Thai ice tea, tod mun, chicken satay, fried pot stickers, fried tofu and a bowl of chicken Tom Yum for appetizers. My entrée,  if I still have room will be garlic prawns and sea scallops. My wife will be having #63.

Well we ate our way through the appetizers... Did anything stand out you might ask. The answer surprised even me. I never thought that Thai food was supposed to not have any flavor. I never knew that it was simply a platform for the sauces,  very disappointing. The Tod mun for example was described as a blend of ground fish and best Thai spices. It had no flavor that stood out except for a slightly fishy aftertaste. It was simply a base for the sauce that accompanied it.
Now the entrée,  garlic prawns and sea scallops. .. Prawns to me are seriously large shrimp bordering on the size of young lobsters. At the very least they should be as large as the shrimp that you would get in a shrimp cocktail at a nice restaurant. Sea scallops are fat and juicy with a diameter akin to a half dollar coin. What appeared on the plate were a lot of vegetables, shrimp the size of ones that you'd buy in a bag at HT and tiny scallops. There were more veggies than seafood. Bummer. I couldn't taste any garlic in the dish and asked for some garlic on the side. I guess all my time with Peter Pan made me believe that I would be given a dish of either raw or roasted garlic instead I was given a small bowl of dry garlic bits.
The only things that saved the meal from being a complete disappointment were the company, the Thai ice tea and the mango with sticky rice for dessert. If I decide to eat here again I really need to review my reviews and order nothing but the Thai ice tea and the mango and sticky rice."}
{"text":"I LOVE great Thai food and I have eaten here a few times, though this last meal was the best this place has done so far!  The service was great and the Decor in nicer than most Thai Restaurants.

Tom Yum Soup 3.5 yelp stars.  Red Curry with Chicken 4.25 stars.  Mango with Sticky Rice for Dessert 2.90 stars."}
{"text":"Really liked this place. The food was delicious and well priced. The atmosphere was incredible, and had a very friendly waitstaff!"}
{"text":"Went to Thai House on a Thursday around 8PM.  A few others were in the restaurant but not crowded at all.  Like other reviewers, I liked the dress of the servers and the decor of the place was pretty cool.  I sat in a booth by myself and was immediately greeted by the server with a menu.

I ordered a Green Tea Sake...SOOO GOOD!  It came in a little glass bottle and it called Sake2Me.  I plan to buy it!

As I enjoyed my sake, I ordered the steamed shrimp dumplings.  Totally not what I expected...two roll-like, dough things came out and it tasted like it looked...just like raw dough stuffed with lots of crunchy lettuce-like pieces and tiny chopped meat.  I didn't see any shrimp, not even mini shrimp.  I was thinking they brought me the wrong item but when I didn't eat my dough, the waiter said \"You don't like your shrimp dumpling?\" I didn't have the heart (or the energy after a long day of travel) to say anything except \"I want to have room for my Pad Thai\".  So, I awaited my Chicken Pad Thai hoping it was what I am used to.

The Pad Thai wasn't bad...not great, but not bad.  Once in a while, I got the taste of mayonaisse but I was starving at this point and it did the trick.  i actually took it back to my hotel for lunch the next day but decided in the morning that the taste wasn't worth the risk of Pad Thai all over my rental car.

I'm not sure if I'll go back to Thai House.  i will certainly look for an alternative next time I'm in town.  If I'm starved and can't find any other place, I'll probably give Thai House another shot...I'll just stay away from anything that says \"dumpling\"."}
{"text":"Four stars instead of five because my service could have been a little better. I came in 40 minutes before they closed down lunch on a Monday and was the only person in there. I still had to hunt my server down to get a refill on my water glass. Anyway, I ordered the pork pho and it was delicious! Excellent broth, plate full of pho fixings, sriracha, hoisin sauce, the works. Perfect temperature to where I didn't burn my mouth on my first bite. Only $8.95 for a huge bowl that I couldn't even finish! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"It was a very tasty and pleasant late lunch for me and the wife. I got the cashews chicken B8 and the wife had B 2 sweet & sour chicken. The only thing 1/2 way though lunch a couple was seated behind us who started crying and making a lot of noise. But luckily we was almost done."}
{"text":"I am so happy for the existence of this place. This is my favorite charlotte thai food restaurant. The curry fried rice and basil fried rice were on point. Spice level was just right and hot the spot. Staff was friendly and very warm. Loved the crispy spring rolls too. Decor is so pretty can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. The prices are fair, the portions are reasonable and the taste is great."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai that you will find in Charlotte. The cuisine is authentic, and always delightful, and the service is superb. Six days out of seven, there will be no wait when you show up, so of course reservations aren't necessary. The longest I have ever had to wait at this restaurant was ten minutes tops. To compliment the Thai theme, the restaurant is beautifully decorated, everything very tasteful and not overdone. The wood carvings along the walls are interesting to behold, and the music is soothing, but not overpowering to conversation. 

The Thai House is versatile as far as occasion is concerned; it serves well for dinner dates, but equally well for business lunches. Though I would recommend business casual attire, the servers never look down at customers in jeans or casual clothes. They are always friendly, and happy to please everyone. 

At lunch time, along with your entree, you are served a soup of the day which is always light and refreshing, and a fried spring roll. The sweet orange sauce that you dip this spring roll in is to die for. I could make a meal on those spring rolls alone. 

Nearly every time I dine at this restaurant, I order the Sweet Jasmine Tea-- absolutely delicious. And although many people recognize Thai food for Pad Thai, PLEASE be adventurous and try some of the curry dishes. My absolute favorite is called Panang Neur (with chicken): this has coconut milk, crushed peanuts and bell peppers over rice. When you are served this dish, it will look like soup-- simply dump the white rice on your plate, and spoon out as much of the chicken, bell peppers, and curried liquid over the rice as you please. This is a SPECIAL TREAT. 

Unfortunately, the above entree is extremely addicting, and you will find yourself craving Thai House curry dishes on the regular. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do! 

PS 
As far as price range is concerned, lunch is very affordable, $10 or less. Dinner dishes range from $12-14 and up, but the food is ALWAYS worth it."}
{"text":"I am a Thai lover so this place really hot the spot. The staff is so knowledgeable. The food is so hot and fresh. Their spring rolls and sauce is literally to die for!! The traditional pad Thai is spicer then their signature one. I'll be back !!"}
{"text":"I've eaten lunch and dinner here a few times, but this was my last visit. I just find the food to be so-so. There's better Thai in Charlotte. The plus is that lunch is cheap. For $8, you can get an entree, soup, and spring roll. The downside is that the food is just not all that flavorful. For example, I had chicken pad Thai today. It was in a sweet red sauce, which was weird. The soup was a bland version of egg drop soup. And the spring roll was flavorless."}
{"text":"Good spot for quick Thai fix- but not if you want authentic Thai. We ordered the chicken pad Thai and the chicken pad ke mow both Thai style. Each dish was slightly sweet- probably due to the oyster sauce. Pad ke now came with a lot of vegetables (carrots, eggplant, green onion) and was saucier than what I'm used to seeing. Only down side was that the restaurant itself felt damp and sticky."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it was pretty decent. The food is alright, a little oversauced at times which I'm not a big fan of. The only problem I have with it is that they give you a huge bowl of curry with a small scoop of rice, and when you ask for more rice, they charge you 1.50 a bowl! Either give larger portions of rice with a dinner-sized curry entree, or cut down on the portions, it's RIDICULOUS that I have to spend up to an extra 3 bucks just to have enough rice for my entree."}
{"text":"I figured out the mystery with the Pad Thai dish. When you order you have to request the brown sauce. 

Today I ordered Pad Kah soup and added red pepper chili sauce... yum. I ordered the tofu pad thai with brown sauce...wow! Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"The items i picked for example the Kung Pa and Beef Pho tasted awful. The Kung pa which was listed as a curry, it did not look like curry at all. It tasted like medicine chicken soup. The beef pho had too much garlic which was odd as beef pho almost never have garlic. I haven't tried other items other than these 2."}
{"text":"This restaurant is AMAZING and the staff are the sweetest. Highly recommend the Chicken Yellow Curry and the fried spring rolls :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and price!!! You will definitely want to eat here if you are a Thai connoisseur like I am. The miso soup is complimentary and is delicious. The restaurant is very clean and I am looking forward to coming back this summer."}
{"text":"Still the best Thai Restaurant in Charlotte.  Quiet and warm ambiance.   Consistent food quality.  The family who owns this small area chain is so kind and so concerned about providing diners with the best experience possible.   I have patronized them for thirty years.   Hopefully I can squeeze out some more visits here because I just can't get enough."}
{"text":"After hanging in pineville for a few hours I decided to make an order here.  I got my favorite green curry with mango sticky rice.  I've never been to this location but I've ordered from the university city location twice or more.  The food was ready as soon as I left the mall's parking lot.  Very friendly manager(?) and nice to talk to.  As always a beautiful restaurant."}
{"text":"It's Valentines Day. All I have to say is the service was pretty horrendous and food was subpar(Pad Thai tasted like ketchup?! And my husbands roasted chicken was frozen in the inside but cooked through?! I don't know how these things happen....) But the mints were good. *prepacked mints*"}
{"text":"My wife and I were starving and I'm the mood for  
a Thai tea. We chose this place on Yelp because they had 4 starts and good reviews are very important. When we pulled up we weren't sure what to expect from the outside because the shopping center was a little slow on a Friday night. Once we got in we could see the place was busy. As you walk towards the tables you are drawn to the hand carved wood decor. Not sure how they got some of these in the restaurant? The staff was very friendly and seated us quickly. We ordered steamed pot stickers and a Thai tea to start. The dipping sauce for the pot stickers was on point and the Thai tea was nice and sweet. My wife ordered veggie pad Thai with the brown sauce and extra peanuts. Can never go wrong with pad Thai. I ordered the sweet and sour chicken. I have ordered this dish at many Chinese and Thai restaurants and I have to say this was the best! The chicken was fried perfectly and they give you the perfect amount of sweat and sour sauce. Many places drown the dish in sauce and lack in vegetables. The dish had large pieces of tomato, zucchini, broccoli, peppers, snap peas and pineapple. SO GOOD! I would highly recommend to anyone. We will be coming back real soon."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic Christmas dinner! Food as always was great, and the service was excellent for a busy Christmas evening (all the staff worked together to make sure we had everything we needed)! 
Thai House is going to be our new Christmas tradition"}
{"text":"Yes, this is a good place for Thai cravings! Many options on the menu, great flavors to the food. The service is really fast and efficient , we ordered had dinner and paid our tab all under an hour!.....but yes delicious curry meals and rice or noodle dishes you are sure to enjoy!"}
{"text":"Fellow Yelper Elisa S. & I have been here 2 times in 7 days for lunch - that's how MMMMM this place is! The lunch specials are just hands down hard to beat. With soup, spring roll in duck sauce and an entree, I've tried the red curry with chicken and the pad thai with chicken and both made me go \"ohhhh, yum!\".

Having never had Thai before this, I am not sure how much I can really speak to the spices, authenticity, or things like that but here's the rundown:

1. Place is AUTHENTIC looking, with all the ornate wood carving it's just a cool place!
2. Waiters are very helpful and attentive
3. The tea they have is minty - yummy and refreshing
4. Every meal I had I've loved - it just takes great!
5. BOGO in Entertainment Books ROCK!

I will keep going back long after the coupons end... :)"}
{"text":"Pad Thai is a little too sweet for my liking. I've tried pad Thai at numerous locations throughout the U.S. and I have to say it didn't taste bad but it wasn't my favorite either. The waitress was hovering so I felt like I needed to make a quick decision. The spring roll that came with my meal was cold. Overall not a bad experience but I've had better."}
{"text":"A friend and I came here for dinner and when I tell you the veggie pineapple fried rice is EVERYTHING.  Just the right amount of savory and sweet; the broccoli wasn't overdone--it was a bit crisp just like I like them.

Nice restaurant and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"My go to place for their Thai house soup and spring rolls. We've been going here for the last 3-4 years. Their food is consistent and the atmosphere is great! Highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Good food. Very bad service. Waited 45 minutes for someone to take our order. Ignored many times. It was like we weren't there. Oh, and we did ask to order many times, but just ignored."}
{"text":"I have really grown to love Thai food, and this is one of my favorite places to come: warm atmosphere with traditional wood carvings, large intimate booths , beautiful friendly people waiting on you and dishes made with rice noodles (gluten free). 
They know how to cook my favorite comfort food: Pad Thai and Pad See Eww perfectly. The chicken satay appetizer is juicy and I love the slaw and peanut sauce it comes with. Every dish has a beautiful palate of vegetables. 
My husband loves extra spicy and if you ask for it, they will deliver it. The flavors in the curries are so wonderful and the dished are garnished with carved vegetables. 
Another favorite of mine here is the Cashew Chicken, which has almost a sweet and sour sauce, balanced with crunchy cashews, sweet peppers and rice. Once again, they will give it a kick if you ask!
The mango dessert is sublime, with just the right amount of sweet creaminess.
I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered vegetarian pad Thai and if was pretty tasteless, even when I asked for extra peanuts. I ate it just because I was hungry. The decor in the restaurant was nice though. Just wish the food was better"}
{"text":"Everything was great. Order things a level or two more spicy tho since I think they serve stuff mild."}
{"text":"Always a great meal with very consistent service. I've eaten here at least 50 times over the last few years and it's always a good experience."}
{"text":"I love Asian food and am always looking for me places. This is a very nice new addition. The decor is nice, a bit formal but not so much that you feel underdressed in jeans. 

The service was good with everyone checking on you as they walked by. 

The beef Satay appetizer was excellent. I could have ordered more and made a meal of just that."}
{"text":"Worse pad Thai I have ever had! Big mess of tasteless nothing all soggy and mushy! Never been there before and never going back!!"}
{"text":"Ugh.  Had the Pad See Ew, and yep it was ew.  Noodles were so overcooked they would disintegrate when picking them up.  Greasy, relatively flavorless.  Spring rolls were burnt and greasy.  Years ago, they had good food.  But the past 4 or 5 years have been terrible.  Best part of the meal was the mints.

Just keep on driving past this joint."}
{"text":"Amazing food and a beautiful atmosphere! I got a delicious coconut dish that tasted like heaven. The sweet tea tastes like green jasmine tea which is a nice new flavor and goes well with the cuisine. However it was really really sweet and they kept refilling our glasses without asking, so be careful because I got a sugar high!"}
{"text":"The decor and restaurant is nice. I ordered pad kee Mao with chicken. On the menu it stated it came with green onions and onions. When I got my dish, there were so many different types of vegetables in it. There was one I had no idea what it was. When I asked the server what it was, he had no clue and asked the chef. Turns out it was eggplant. I wish they would make better descriptions. Plus side to this restaurant is that there is hot sauce on every table."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Charlotte and the prices are unbeatable. The interior is nice and relaxing. I order to go a lot too and my order is perfect every time."}
{"text":"We came here for an early dinner so it wasn't crowded and were quickly offered a seat and the server was already ready to take our order.  We had to ask for another minute just to look over the standard, yet mesmerizing, menu.  

I ordered the Pad Krapraw with brown rice and chopped chicken.  Yes, even for me that was new.  When it came to the table, I even forgot it was chopped and thought there were too many nuts on top.  I was skeptical as I usually prefer the cutlets of chicken and thought they were pulling a fast one on me with substandard meat.  I added the brown rice with the sauce and I couldn't stop eating.  The sweet, garlic and basil flavor really came out and reminded me why Thai is my favorite of Asian food.  I tried to save some to take home for later, but I just had to take more bites.

The prices are reasonable for quality Thai food.  I've tasted much worse in NYC but dishes were less than $10.  Appears they have two other locations in the Charlotte area, so expanding from a small family business suggests that's good news."}
{"text":"Exactly what we've been looking for.  All the flavors were perfect- especially the peanut sauce!  Can't wait to come back for more.  Have a few more dishes to get the dish on."}
{"text":"Not my favorite place, but you know what, the service is good, the pad see ew is legit and plentiful, and the curries are OK. 

3 stars because if you want to order green curry for lunch, you have to pay dinner prices for ($14! WHAT!?). There was an abundance of rice and chicken, but I didn't think it was salty enough. Next time I guess I would try the Red curry for lunch, or the Mussaman if I'm ever here on a Friday (available for lunch only Fridays).

This is odd, but I really really like the free soup that comes with lunch."}
{"text":"I've been a frequent diner over the years for some obvious reasons:  Amazing Food---Excellent Service---Beautiful Ambiance.  Also, the food is always consistently good...without fail!  It's possibly my favorite Thai restaurant in town.  What more can I say?"}
{"text":"Well I have a favorite Thai restaurant (Thai First) but the good reviews persuaded me to give this place a shot. Now I wish that I hadn't wasted my time.

The decor is nice, but that's it. When we sat down in this almost empty restaurant, it took about ten minutes for a server to greet us, and that was only after I waved one down.

They do NOT sale any liquor, only beer, wine, & saki. I ordered the cold saki (the only cold saki on the menu) and my bf ordered a Yuengling. They were out of both...... she acted as if this were normal.

The Tom Yum soup was just okay But the knock out rolls were really good.

We split the Kai Khua and it was also just okay. I would write more about it, but there's really not anything worth mentioning.


End result: We will not be back. It was a below average Thai restaurant and they should better stock their restaurant. 

GO TO \"THAI FIRST\" INSTEAD!!!"}
{"text":"Sweet and sour chicken. Great if you like deep fried- hardly any chicken inside. Broccoli slightly brown tops. Sauce not sweet or sour just there.... Hope for good based on reviews. Disappointed but I'll eat it"}
{"text":"This place has been around for awhile, since I moved to Charlotte.  It was one of the first Thai places I went to, ever in my life.  They have nice décor and a very large area for seating customers.  The atmosphere is nice.  The customer service was pretty decent as well.  The staff is overall friendly and accommodating.

The food is ok.  I got some type of curry dish each time I've been here.  It was never really consistent, but never bad.  Sometimes the spice level was a bit off from the time before.  The mango sticky rice is my favorite item on the menu.  It is very delectable.  If you've never had it, it is a must try and definitely worth the price.  

The food is not 100% my favorite, but would come back for the sticky rice alone!"}
{"text":"The menu is great. There are so many options to choose from. I love all of their rice dishes. The garlic and ginger chicken is yummy. The lard nar is really flavorful. I also tried their fried tilapia with vegetables and it was superb. The servers are so cute in their Thai outfits. They are really friendly as well. The prices are good, they have great deals for lunch. You have to try it."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp, very nice inside, very friendly i came here because of the great reviews. The prices are very reasonable. They have daily specials too. For LESS than $10 I can get healthy yummy food, Instead of going thru a drive-thru for horrible fast food! 
I ordered green curry, what a GREAT CHOICE! i now have a new favorite Thai restaurant!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid. I went recently with my family. The food was great and the appetizer was good too. Come check this place out soon if you are interested in trying new foods besides burgers and fries."}
{"text":"I got take out from here today for lunch and it was ok.  Portion size was good but I'd prefer to go to pei-wei. Their food is a lot bettee plus thai house messed up my order."}
{"text":"We love Thai food & the Thai House doesn't disappoint.  Food is fresh, well seasoned & hot when it arrives to your table. we started our meal with spring rolls. Nicely deep fried with crisp shell. Delicious sweet sauce to dip in. 
I had the Pad Kee Mow, AKA Drunken Noodles.  Chicken was grilled nicely before added to the noodles. The vegetables weren't undercooked and the dish wasn't overloaded with veggies vs. meat. Plate presentation was nice. 

My wife chose her favorite Red Curry (med heat). Perfect curry seasoning. Excellent meal. Excellent price.  

We also had the 3 springs rolls as an appetizer. They were complimented well with the sweet sauce that comes with them. 

If you like Thai then I strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Try their brunch specials - we tried #6 with tofu - our new favorite!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I usually order the yellow curry chicken.  HUGE portions and they'll make it as spicy or NOT spicy as you like."}
{"text":"This is really a 4.5. Excellent as always. We always do a red curry and a masaman curry, and it never disappoints.  

A little light on the veggies in the masaman which is why it wasn't a perfect review"}
{"text":"I stopped into Thai House for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  The restaurant wasn't very busy and I was seated right away.  The decor is very interesting, carved wood everywhere with a carved log sculpture dominating the center of the restaurant.  My server came over and took my drink order.  Shortly after another server brought a bowl of chicken soup which was OK.  It took a little bit for my server to come back to take my order, but I had the chicken soup to slurp on while I waited.  I ordered the chicken pad Thai along with an order of steamed spring rolls.  The spring rolls weren't like the typical ones I've gotten in other Thai restaurants.  They had tofu instead of shrimp and the wrapper wasn't the translucent rice wrapper other places use.  The spring rolls were OK, but I wouldn't order them again.  The pad Thai came out shortly after I finished the spring rolls.  It looked good and OK tasting.  The lunch prices were very reasonable, $7.95 for the pad Thai. The service was OK, the food was OK, I guess that makes Thai House an OK place to eat."}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for years now with my family and we never leave disappointed. It's always been great experience and consistent with their food. Their staff are very attentive and always make you feel welcome and you can also feel their culture as well."}
{"text":"Ummmm, what changed??? Went tonight and ordered Pad Thai. Disgusting.  They have switched sauces, the usual peanut sauce was missing.  In its place was a watered down ketchup sauce. I had 3 other people taste my dish just to make sure I wasn't  crazy,  and they all agreed that it tasted gross.  

We also ended up with 2 waitresses. They didn't communicate so we were constantly interrupted and honestly we felt like they were being very pushy with us.  

Not impressed,  left hungry."}
{"text":"The spice here is on point! Loved the heat of the Tom Yum soup. I have been to and love the Thai house in Huntersville, so I had high expectations of this one. The staff were very kind, so it pangs me to have anything negative to say. I ordered Tom yum soup and of Thai take out. The tom yum was pretty good. The pad Thai was just lacking. The shrimp were tiny (smaller than in the soup), there were too many noodles, and not enough sauce (it was a bit dry). There were plenty of peanuts and sprouts, but the fish just overall was lacking.  For the lunch price paid, I expect better quality! The Thai tea was pretty standard, so that was good."}
{"text":"Food is super tasty!  Delicious flavors and textures.  Just the right amount of sauces and curries per dish.  I ordered the Vegetarian Yellow Curry, which was top notch perfect!  I don't remember what my parents ordered, but they were equally as delighted and satisfied as I was.  I cannot wait to return.  Also, the ambiance and decor inside is really nice!  I like the detailed woodwork and artwork.  Family run!"}
{"text":"I realized that there are not many thai restaurants to serve soft shell crab dishes and I found it! Nice restaurant with exotic and nice decorations. 

Main dishes were soft shell crab in a red coconut curry and panang curry with chicken and beef. The soft shell crab was crispy and the curry was creamy and tasty. 

For the panang curry, we asked the spice level of 3 and it was spicy enough. Both of dishes were red curry but it was very different. If you are a fan of spicy food, panang curry will be good for you."}
{"text":"The Thai carved wood and overall decor is amazing- and the service was fine. Sorry to disagree with others, but my wife and I found the food to be quite ordinary and well-below quality at other Thai restaurants we visit. 

The fried spring rolls were greasy- possibly were just fried a second time to get them hot. The Mee Krob was a good appetizer except the lettuce was partially wilted and brown in spots. I usually love pad thai but what was served had soggy noodles and not a lot of taste. 

Perhaps the main chef was not working on the weekday night I was there. Not likely to try again though."}
{"text":"A great place for Thai foods! Awesome staffs and wicked foods ( wicked =awesome)! Went there yesterday and order curry duck dish ( dont know the name though) it was soo good! Prob one few best Thai restaurant in charlotte! :)"}
{"text":"Pineapple fried rice was delicious! Ordered with the chicken but I will probably try something other than chicken next time. (It was cooked well just dull on flavor.) But the rice by itself was enough to be amazing and I surprised myself by eating the entire plate."}
{"text":"Thai places can be swing or miss. This place was a nice surprise.

Me and some work buddies stumbled in here one Friday because we got to Mr. Tokyo too late to get a seat but we wanted Asian for lunch and only had an hour or so to be back to work.

It was very pleasant, I noticed they have a bar for dinner and weekends, the staff was very friendly and the vibe was really nice. Decorations were very easy going and gave a good Thai/Asian feel.

They gave us some complimentary chicken noodle soup while we reviewed the menu, and it was really nice on a cold day. Nothing crazy but definitely nothing to complain about.

The menu was simple and sweet with some lunch specials that were really nicely priced. My whole thing is that when you go out to a new  Thai place you have to try their Pad Thai the first time. If they cannot nail this nothing else will probably be good.

I told her she could make it as spicy as they want. It came out shortly after we finished the soup and the dish was beautiful. I wish I had taken some pictures but I couldn't wait to dive in.
They had the perfect amount of ingredients on the plate( not too many bean sprouts and onion like some places) , the chicken was excellent so tasty and the sauce had just the right amount of peanut flavor.

The plate comes out assembled like it's right off the wok on a street cart like I remember from little Asia. So you get the right to stir it up how you want. 
It was spicy and delicious and she even gave me a bottle of in house mad chilli sauce to add myself. I was in heaven,  stuffed and sweating when I left.

I will definitely be back soon to try more menu items and if I ever have a sitter want to drive up to Charlotte for dinner.

Thanks and good job."}
{"text":"I never quite understand why some people look so miserable... especially when one works at a restaurant, where people come and dine for enjoyment.  I haven't been to Thai House in a long time, and this's my 1st visit to this location, and they still manage to have the same unfriendly, slow, unacceptable level of service as they always had (the one at University area) and apparently known for... hmmm, not sure if that's a reputation you want there Thai House.

To use up a Groupon, we had dinner there last night.  Amidst it's Father's Day, it wasn't really that busy or crowded.  Somehow we still had to sit around for a LONG time before our order was taken... this was after a seemingly non-busy waiter walked by us numerous times and never even turned his head our way AND after a waitress ignored the heck out of my \"excuse me.\"  

Food wise it was ok.  I had the roast duck with pineapple curry sauce while my dinner-mate ordered the Tom Kha (coconut brothy soup) and the beef Pad Krapraw.  The soup was interesting, since coconut tends to be associated with sweet food items; I personally like it, it's not heavy at all.  My roast duck was a little misleading considering it was more fried than roasted.  The meat was a little over-cooked, but the curry sauce was good enough to compensate.  I had half a fork full of the beef Pad Krapraw... can't tell if it was good but this is normally my fav lunch dish (except I think it works better with chicken or pork). 

In all, this is an average meal (food quality wise), but the service was  unbelievably bad.  When the most impressive part of the dinner is the decor (rich & ethnic without the tackiness)... well, enuff said."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today.  Except I didn't realize they don't serve lunch on the weekends.  They serve brunch.  The single sided paper menu offered ten to twelve different options to choose from, none of which I was jonesing for.  C'est la vie!

I had the pineapple curry with chicken.  It included a fried egg roll and a bowl of soup, for $8.99.  The price was right and the entree was tasty, but other two items were \"just a bit outside.\"  The soup was nothing I was familiar with, but consisted of one piece of dry chicken, a couple of pieces of carrots, and a plethora of cabbage.  It was nothing exciting.  Nor was the egg roll.

But the entree was good.  It was red curry based and had some solid flavor.  I enjoyed it a lot. 

The service was good.  When I placed my order, the gentleman let me know that it was going to be a little bit spicy.  I told him that I was okay with that, but I appreciated the warning.  Drinks were filled promptly, and the check was brought in a relatively timely manner.

I might try to go back when there they are serving their full menu, to try the dish I was looking for."}
{"text":"Always look forward to going to Thai House. The Thai tea is very delicious. The food is always so delicious and the price is pretty fair. Definitely recommend the pineapple fried rice and the hot pot."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a Thai House near my new job because I go to the Thai House University location all the time. While the University location is amazing, I quickly found out that this location is anything but.

The first time I ordered lunch, I received a dish that was way too salty. I didn't save the leftovers. I ALWAYS keep my University Thai House leftovers for a second meal.

I thought maybe it was a fluke, and decided to give them a second chance.

Ordered again today- even worse than my first lunch. My chicken pad thai tasted too sweet. Another yelp'ers description of it tasting like ketchup is not far off.  The noodles were overcooked and mushy. The spring roll is slightly burnt and the chicken rubbery. To top it all off, the man who gave me my food had a bad attitude. Considering I was simply waiting for my food patiently, no grumpiness was needed.  Never going here again, though the other location I will continue to go to regularly as they have delicious food and super friendly staff."}
{"text":"The food is good and it comes out fast. the turn around here is great if you have somewhere you need to be after dinner but a little too much if you would like to hang out a little and take your time with dinner. But, the food is good. The dinner portions are always better, from the amount of food you get to even the size of the shrimp. (The shrimp on the dinner portion are actually twice the size.) And the food is good."}
{"text":"We loved our Thai place in Boston and really missed having someplace to go get Pad Thai. We moved into the area and found this place and fell in love with it.

The inside of the restaurant is beautiful and really clean. The staff are all really nice and attentive. They have takeout, which works for us since we live a few blocks away.

I thought the food was great. We've tried a few different meals. My wife does not enjoy very spicy food and the mild versions suit her fine. I do like my food spicy and if I had one complaint it's that I wouldn't mind if the spicy dishes were a little hotter than what I've experienced so far. The food has great flavors and think it is spot on."}
{"text":"Not sure why the $$ this place is over priced and bad bland food. 12.95 for beef basil? They don't use real Thai chili peppers, I like spicy and asked for it. They sprinkle Nasty old chill powder which ruined the dish. No flavor and not worth $12.95 

Skip this place.

Also called to let them know: response was \" ok, is there anything else I can do for you??????????\"

Wow what rude jerks!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is seriously becoming my favorite Thai place in Charlotte.  When I come here for lunch, I am never disappointed.  Even when the restaurant is busy, the staff has been friendly, the food comes out fast, the service is superb and the food is always flavorful and fresh.

I usually get the Namprigpaow or Pad Krapraw with chicken, no rice and extra spice.  My belly and tastebuds are always happy.  This is comfort food at its best! 

Lunch also comes with soup and a spring roll.  The soup varies from day to day.

Also their iced tea is jasmine tea...sweet or unsweet.   I love jasmine tea!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food. Even soup was brought out to us before our lunch meal. Everything was served hot, fresh, and quick. The waitresses and waiters wear traditional Thai clothing. Absolutely loved it!"}
{"text":"Outside of building was unassuming as it is located within a strip mall. Service, interior decore and food was amazing, will definitely come again. I recommend the crispy duck, mango sticky rice and cold saki."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food in South Charlotte.  This place is good for lunch, dinner and take-out.  Be sure to tell them how spicy you want it - sometimes they ask your preference on a scale of one to four, or low/medium/high.  (Hint: \"medium\" packs a punch!)  

The service is usually good, though a couple of times they didn't come around to my table fast enough to refill my tea.  (If I remember, I'll sometimes tell the waiter, \"Your tip is tied to my glass of tea!\")  Their spring rolls are good, and the Pad Thai is the best I've had anywhere. 

Tips:
- Parking is good.
- Mentally drained from work?  When you leave the office, call Thai House with your take-out order and it will be ready by the time you get to the restaurant. Take-out is usually ready in 10-15 minutes, maybe 20 if they're packed."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!! Service good, restaurant decor is really unique. Wouldn't have picked this place necessarily by outside looks, but don't let the cover fool you!! It's in a strip mall and looks like your run of the mill everyday restaurant, but once you step inside you'll be transported to Thailand.  You really should do yourself a favor and check this place out....you won't be disappointed!"}
