{"text":"Had dinner last night (a Tuesday) night and it was pretty decent for a mid-week dinner. 

We each had the house special pho, regular size ($7.95), the broth was on par with other pho locations in China town and the portion was a good size with a variety of meat, including tripe, meatballs, fatty beef, and even two little quail eggs. 

Husband also ordered Pnb spring rolls, there were 6 in an order for $7.95. They look like the ones in the picture. At first I was thrown off, as its a shrimp wrapped in egg, that made an interesting texture. Husband enjoyed them though!

For service, there was only 1 server, and one person in the open kitchen (which your can see, so that's good too), so she was busy, but there were only 3 or 4 tables going, which I think is normal for this strip mid-week. 

All in all, it's a good place for me to get my pho fix, close to home. Would be willing to go back and try something else!

Also, it's a bit suspicious that two reviews on here have the same spring roll picture?"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a bit. Although I think they may be closed.

I usually get the house special's when I go for Pho, usually has a nice assortment of meats. Pho Noodle Bar is no exception. However, I'm not quite sold on the Quail Egg that they put inside. I've started to ask for them to hold on the egg.

I love their Pho, great portions. However, I ordered their vermicelli with a spring roll and was somewhat disappointed. The spring roll was dry and the pork with it had little flavour. I also got a smoothie on special, in what seemed like child like cup. 

In conclusion, Go for the Pho. Steer clear of the other stuff."}
{"text":"Seems like a nice place décor and food wise, but for somehow now when some time has passed from our visit there, we can't remember much of the food :) It wasn't bad, most definitely not, but not something extraordinary as well.

On a rainy Saturday evening we were the only customers in this fancy décor Thai and Vietnamese restaurant. Wanted to try their Pho, but didn't see vegetarian option so instead chose something from their vegetarian menu which was Tofu, bean curd and veggie noodle soup. 

Since it didn't leave amazing culinary for us, it is hard to recommend, but check out yourself, as the reviews are good."}
{"text":"Stumbled in here months ago with a friend since I live in the area and wow what a surprise. The portions are huge and filling and pretty cheap too. Since then, I've been taking different people there from time to time. My only gripe is that the pad thai isn't great at all. I'd stick to pho."}
{"text":"I had such a great experience, the food tasted great , server was friendly and it all came super fast! And only 4.50 for a Sapporo can't go wrong my new favourite pho place close to home. I'm gonna be coming back weekly!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here a lot. I love their Coconut curry chicken pho and their shu mai! We ate here 2 nights back to back this week. Chicken thigh lemongrass is a bit bland though. Restaurant is very simple, casual, quiet, decent, and clean. This is our go to place when I am too lazy to cook."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was delicious! We had the pnb spring rolls (had to order a second bc it was that amazing), curry chicken pho (as recommended, this dish sells out fast!), satay beef pho (loved the flavour in the broth) and Thai fried rice (one of the best I've ever tasted!). A cute little place to hang out at.. $4.50 Sapporo 's were a bonus! Amazing food, fast service and great atmosphere! Will definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"I can't stop coming here, the food is excellent and I've been dragging friends there every chance I get. Rare beef and flank, as well as the Curry chicken pho are definitely must-tries!"}
