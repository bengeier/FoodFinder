{"text":"They have the best eastern foods all types of grills . I'v ate the best kabab ever. I love everything they have and they always have new activities . I highly recommend it ."}
{"text":"I love the friendly staff, wide selection of premium Shisha flavours, and  the freshly prepared in-house dished that are unmistakibley Middle Eastern. This has made it stand out from the other handful of Shisha Cafes in Mississauga. The dish that you must try is the Shish Tawook. So if you're ever with a group of friends and you can't figure out where to go to in Mississauga, I would strongly recommend that you give C U @ Cafe a shot!"}
{"text":"Well, i wanted to try the place.  I gave it my best shot.  I drove up, i walked in...............................................and i stood there.....................................................and i stood there............................................................and i stood there....................................................................................and i stood there some more.  People looked at me, people whispered, people ignored me as they did things in the back of the restaurant.   After feeling like an idiot, i turned around and walked out disgusted with the fact that i felt as if my business was not wanted because i am not middle eastern.  Screw you C U @ Cafe, i wont be back unless its to C U @ your bankruptcy auction."}
