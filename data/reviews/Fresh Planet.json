{"text":"While their smoothies are not necessarily the best, their hummus is amazing. I love this place based on the hummus pita wrap alone. The service can be a bit slow, but they are always really friendly and sweet. The hummus is really a lot different than a lot of others I have tried."}
{"text":"Two visits in the last two weeks. First visit, salad was full of old lettuce. Second visit, we were in the bathroom less than an hour after eating the salad. Did they wash the lettuce? Not sure what is going on with the salads. Not going back."}
{"text":"There don't seem to be many places in the Avon area that have fresh food options that isn't a sit down restaurant. This is a go-to place for my boyfriend and I when we want something not made with grease, butter or oil. I love the wraps/pitas here and have recently tried the rice bowls which I have come to love. They have tons of flavor options with their smoothies but I do wish you could get a larger size smoothie for a more affordable price."}
{"text":"Not fresh at all.  Pace salsa, bottled dressings, etc.  The place needs cleaned too.  One star because smoothies are good but doubt their freshness as their food isn't."}
{"text":"First time at fresh planet and I was impressed! Huge menu, the staff was patient while my husband and I decided what to get and were very friendly. The food was extremely fresh and full of flavor! We usually eat pretty healthy so we liked that everything is prepared fresh when you order. We will definitely add this to our healthy take-out options! I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I really like the liquid planet local chain! This was my first time to this location but it is exactly the same as the others even though the name is a little different. Their smoothies are always good and they don't add a bunch of fillers to them. For example, instead of using ice which could water it down, they use a few frozen pieces of fruit like bananas to keep it cold then other fresh fruits added in. They have a wide selection of smoothies with all kinds of boosts. I definitely like Liquid planet much better than some of the national chains around town. 

I have had a few of their salads and pitas which I have also enjoyed. Be careful, they tend to go heavy on the sauce so if you prefer just a little bit, just tell them!"}
{"text":"Food always makes me sick and is very bland. Have found hair in my food before too. Also, their online menu prices are cheaper than the actual menu prices in store. So if you want to look online at their menu beforehand, don't pay attention to what it says because it's most likely incorrect. Hours posted online are also incorrect. Bottom line, don't eat the food unless you want diarrhea and don't look at their information online unless you want to be lied to."}
{"text":"The smoothies and juices are very good. However, for the concept they are selling the ingredients in the dishes are POOR. If you claim to be a health food store... Don't serve me basic shredded cheddar cheese, don't give me nutrition-less iceberg lettuce, don't give me day old pre-cut red onions. I've had higher quality, fresher ingredients and better flavor at chipotle. If your business is named \"Fresh Planet\" things need to be ORGANIC... Step it up."}
{"text":"First time in a \"liquid or fresh planet\" facility. They gave us time patiently to figure out what we wanted off the menu. I got the Neptune salad and a Men's Only smoothie and Balsamic Basil vinigrette, everything was very tasty. They have a points program, spend so much and get $5 off. The wife and daughter got wraps, wife got the Clevelander and daughter got a chicken wrap. Both wife and daughter also got the chicken paprikash , could've used some healthy seasonings. Over all a very good healthy alternative to eating out."}
{"text":"Great healthy food options here.  The peanut butter walnut smoothie is my guilty pleasure.  The chicken paprikash is good too."}
{"text":"Got the Clevelander pita combo, it was delicious. Their paprikash is yummy as well. Decent pricing too, it was $15 for 2 pita combo's."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it a 3.5. Had a Groupon and it was still pricey.

Theses poor girls looked like chickens running around with their heads chopped off. It was chaotic. The lines where long, the services was slow. 

The food was OK, nothing I couldn't make at home for cheaper. Nothing special. 

Personally, I like Robeks smoothies better."}
{"text":"This place has a great menu for lunch. Fresh ingredients and combinations give healthy options that many restaurants do not. I recommend the Thai Peanut Bowl. It's packed with veggies and the sauce is delicious. The staff is great at recommending smoothies. They stay open later now, but never changed their sign. That can be confusing."}
{"text":"Had the spicy Chilli Thai rice bowl.  Advertised as Hot. But I would judge it as medium   Nice fresh veggies   Had a Celery Kiss Swirl to drink, ginger gave it a nice zing."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. Always freshly made. My reason for giving this 3 stars is because they're a little pricey for the amount of food that you get. And they don't offer any nutrition information. Some of us count calories or carbs and would love to have that info. Even though they're a bit pricey, if nutrition info were available, I would probably go here more often."}
{"text":"We stopped into Fresh Planet on a whim since we were shopping over at Avon Commons and wanted a quick \"light\" dinner before going to see a movie. We were going to opt for Panera but we've passed Fresh Planet a few times (it's in the plaza with Chipotle and Marc's) and decided to try something new. We walk by the Liquid Planet in Crocker sometimes and this is a sister store of the brand apparently. We walked through the door and the place had a bright but dated feel and reminded me almost of a forgotten ice cream parlor. It had some older looking booths and tables throughout and there was a small gathering of patrons on the inside.
 
The menu is pretty simple, salads, wraps, smoothies which are all supposedly fresh and made to order. The menu is displayed brightly and loudly when you walk in and there are tons of options; the menu was actually a bit intimidating with so many choices. We were greeted kind of sheepishly by what seemed like a newer employee who wasn't very friendly. She took our order of 1 hangover smoothie (to split), the Clevelander chicken pita and the \"special of the day\" buffalo chicken pita. Both pitas come with sides and we both opted for chips and salsa (the other options of sides didn't seem all that appetizing).
 
We waited about 5 minutes for our food to be prepared by one girl who was working extremely hard (probably the manager) and another who looked as if she would rather be anywhere else. Our food was brought to the service station where they hand it to you and I grabbed a cup of the complimentary water. We decided to go halves on the pitas and I dug into the buffalo style one first. This was like any other buffalo chicken wrap I have had. Decent chicken, decent sauce and decent ingredients. Literally decent but not one step above decent. My \"Clevelander\" sub pretty much tasted exactly the same but it had bacon and & peppercorn sauce which made it slightly the better of the 2.  The chips were Tositios Rounds and the salsa pretty much tasted like it was from a jar. I really wasn't a fan of the Hangover smoothie (strawberries, mango, banana, OJ, and a bunch of other things I can't really remember); to put it honestly it wasn't worth the money I spent on it.
 
Fresh Planet wasn't the worst dinner I have ever had but I would expect a place with the title of \"Fresh\" to have a little fresher menu. Nothing seemed all that fresh, the complimentary water was lukewarm, the employees weren't very friendly at all and the place seemed kind of dirty. I wish the side items they offered were more homemade and that the smoothies tasted a little better. 21 dollars for 2 pitas and a one smoothie seemed a bit high considering the items we received were not all that \"fresh\". I will most likely not return."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is healthy and flavorful with good portion sizes.   I've been to the Avon and Crocker Park (Liquid Planet) locations a number of times and have never left the place disappointed.

I'm a big fan of the rice bowls and pita wraps. The rice bowls come in a nice, reusable container and they load it up with brown rice! I usually get the chicken paprikash bowl. The Cleveland pita wrap is great..very flavorful, healthy and filling.Their pizzas are really good too..crisp and lightly topped with not too much cheese.  

They have a huge selection of freshly made smoothies and salads too!  My go-to smoothies are the Workout smoothy and the Green Genie. The young ladies working there are very polite and efficient. 

Check Groupon for deals!  I buy one every time!  Don't forget to sign up for their rewards program!  They'll text you deals every now and then.  This past week, I got a $5 credit and then a text for a free cup of fresh made soup!

Stop in for fast, friendly service and good, healthy eats!"}
