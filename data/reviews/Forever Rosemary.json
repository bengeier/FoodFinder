{"text":"I get to leave the first review! Hoorah!  I ordered delivery through grubhub and everything was great. Good, standard, tasty Chinese takeout. It came a little earlier than the estimated delivery time. Nice portions and decent prices!"}
{"text":"This was probably the worst Chinese food I've ever had. Spring rolls were salty and inedible and the vegetable lo mein had no flavor...just greasy noodles with very salty vegetables. The crab rangoon was good, but it was probably because it was literally just cream cheese in a wonton. Quick delivery, terrible food."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Chinese delivery I've ever had.  I always leave detailed instructions for the driver, but it was very obvious that they did not read them. The driver called me and YELLED into the phone asking where I was. I repeated the instructions to get him where he needed to be, and we hung up. Five minutes later, he calls back and proceeds to YELL at me again, saying he's on the wrong side of the building than what I had just said. So I correct him again and we hang up. I go outside to wait. The driver pulls up and yells over at me, you order food? So I approach the car, only to find two other people in there with him. Some guy in the back seat roughly grabs my bag of food and shoves it to the front. The driver then rudely asked me if the order was paid for. I said it was, the whole time wondering why he wouldn't know that.  As for the food, it was awful. I ordered coconut shrimp, general tso's chicken, and fried pork dumplings. The shrimp was beyond overcooked; it was chewy and soggy and overall flavorless. The chicken was similarly overcooked and soggy, and definitely not spicy like the menu said. The dumplings were also soggy and lacking flavor. To top it off, the food was barely even warm. It was completely inedible.  Do not order from this place! They hire crazy drivers and clearly can't cook food."}
