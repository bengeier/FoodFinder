{"text":"I stopped in because of a coupon offer and had wanted to try them out for awhile.  I was pleased to see that there were plenty of menu items and lots of types of smoothies.  However, all the good things about this place were wiped out for me because of the actions of one of the employees.  After placing my order and paying, I watched an employee make my smoothie.  As my drink was blending, she reached for an empty cup in preparation for the transfer but she missed and knocked it onto the ground.  Instead of throwing that cup away and getting a new one, she bent down, picked the cup off the ground, proceeded to transfer my smoothie from the blender INTO THE DIRTY CUP, then handed it to me like there wasn't anything wrong.  I called her on it, and she proceeded to make me a new smoothie, albeit reluctantly, because she was clearly agitated that I asked for a replacement.  It's too bad really, because I couldn't enjoy my smoothie without freaking out just a little bit with every sip.  You'd think it would be common sense move to replace the soiled cup but if that employee didn't care that I saw her drop then reuse my cup, who knows what other unsanitary practices they use out of sight when they prep the other foods they sell here?  *NOTE*   This experience happened to me on April 4, 2012, and I have not returned to the business.  This employee may already be long gone..."}
{"text":"Smoothies taste great. Service is often unfriendly. They charge for a cup of water here. I'm sure that's illegal in the state of Arizona."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a couple of times with an OK experience, but tonight we arrived 3 minutes before closing and the clerk had already turned off the open sign and locked the door.  We tried to walk up to see if he would change his mind but he wouldn't even look up for at least a minute, endlessly staring at the floor or at the walls in an attempt to avoid eye contact...low class move.  I would have minded less had he simply acknowledged us and said \"sorry we're closed\".  It was almost closing time - I understand wanting to go home - but regardless it's not the way to treat customers.  I have contacted what I presume is Smoothie King management (Greg) about this as well."}
{"text":"Excellent service every time. The owner is their often and he keeps things running very well. I've been to other locations and the service was not this good. Very friendly staff. I go all the time."}
{"text":"The guys working here seemed very bothered I wanted to purchase a smoothie.  Very unfriendly!!"}
{"text":"I have been a long time patron of smoothie king and I have to say this one is by far the worst one that I have ever been to.  The service was horrible and the drink that I ordered (Gladiator) was not made correctly.  I would not visit this location ever again and I would not suggest that it to anyone either."}
{"text":"I love this place. I usually go about every other day. Today was my 16th visit. Great reasonable prices. Great service. Great products. A very diverse menu with soo much to choose from. Wether you are looking for a meal replacement, an after workout drink, an energy pick me up, or just wanting to trim some pounds. They have litterally anything to your hearts desire. For vegetarians and vegans both they even have smoothie categories to choose from for you! Bring the kids they have choices for the little smoothie enthusiasts.  I only have had one very minor bad experience by one of their regular employees. However , great news about that is I brought that to the Store Manager's attention the very next day and he went above and beyond my expectations on resolving the issue. Again great truly exceptional service. Don't ever second guess stopping in, they are not your typical smoothie at the mall kind of shop. Smoothie King Fitchburg is THE BEST smoothie store in all of the Madison area. Stop by next time your passing through the south side of Fitchburg =)"}
{"text":"So bomb! I had a terrible sinus cold and this place saved me. I can't remember which one I got but it had a lot of vitamin C or something. Anyways. It was really great cause I was feeling so crappy and that smoothie really helped.   Great service!  It's priced decently for what you get!   Yum!   We will be back!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a cool refreshing smoothie. The customer service is awesome. I was greeted fast with a smiling face. It's a great place to go for a pre or post workout smoothie or even just a quick cool drink for these warm Arizona days. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"excellent customer service! I went in my first time and the women working was so nice and gave me so many excellent suggestions. they were super friendly and very fast!! I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Please be aware that the Smoothie King on Indian School is one of the most unprofessional and disgusting establishments I have dealt with in a long time. Besides the fact that the place is a mess for all customers to see, the owner and manager are about as rude and unprofessional as they come. I have been a member of the Arcadia community almost my entire life and take pride in supporting our local small businesses, but the way the owner and manager treat their customers and employees is borderline harassment. If I had a young teenager or adult looking for a job I would advise them to STAY AWAY from Smoothie King. The owner blatantly belittles and humiliates his hard-working employees.   I heard through the grapevine that one of the employees was robbed at gunpoint recently and the owner did not so much as check on his employee and then had him return to work the following night to work alone again. The fact that the owner and manager completely disregard their employees safety is unfathomable. I cannot even begin to imagine what it would be like to have a gun waved in my face and then not be supported by my supervisor and owner. Besides the fact that they do not regard safety they openly curse and use profanity in front of guests, sometimes in regards to an employee. I could not believe my ears when I heard some of the comments made without any realization that I, a guest, was standing nearby.   Please do not continue to support this local business. There are many other choices of smoothies in the area. In fact, McDonald's makes a much better smoothie that the so-called \"Smoothie King.\""}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow, lemme tell you! My mom use to try and get me on the smoothie kick and ive never liked them, but my man Greg gave me a free smoothie coupon to try and i hate to say it but theres no lookin back now ! Ive tried a lot of different smoothies and shakes but my go to is \"the hulk\" but aside from the life changing flavor the staff is fantastic, almost too nice !! Ahah jk but keep it up guys, ill defenitly see you soon !"}
{"text":"I love getting my smoothies from Smoothie King, but I've noticed that the employees at this location are not very friendly. I'm not one to give negative reviews and I hope I won't have to make one again for a long time. I've tried giving them a chance time and time again because I know what it's like to work in customer service, but yesterday I came in around 4pm and saw that all the chairs were up, but the door was unlocked and the sign said Open. I was kind of confused about the chairs and so I asked the cashier up front if they were closing and he just stared at me and said nothing and just stood there. Ok.. so then I expected him to ask me what I'd like but he just continued staring at me without saying anything, so I made my order. After he made my smoothie I thanked him, but he just stared at me again and didn't say anything. Really? I always try to be understanding and I know sometimes it sucks working in customer service, but that sort of attitude is completely unacceptable. I hope this location does something about their employees because I love their smoothies, but their customer service is just outright terrible."}
{"text":"So glad this establishment has come to the neighborhood. I would highly recommend having enough staff working for the crowds though. My smoothie was awesome.... My husbands probably would have been great if it wouldn't have gotten double blended with all the extra ice added in."}
{"text":"Great place in the Central Valley of Phoenix to grab a smoothie. However just recently learned they close at 3:00pm on Saturday. I'm sure the biz has its reasons, but dunno if it's wise too close early on Ssturday"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. Kind of glad I found it. Nice place to get a pre or post workout shake. Staff is friendly, place is clean, and service is fast. Can't complain. I had the Vanilla Coffee shake. It's kind of confusing if you don't know much about protein shakes. But they have patience. I also got some meat chips there which is pretty interesting but pretty tasty. The medium sized cups are like extra large! Very nice place. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Poor Smoothie King....it looks like you're not exactly everyone's cup of tea but I still heart you. I have grown up on smoothies from Jamba Juice during my junior high days, Blendz during high school and Juice It Up throughout college and post grad. While almost any smoothie can make me a happy camper I would prefer Smoothie King if possible. While it is a bit pricey I enjoy the texture of smoothies here more than others. Jamba smoothies are icier than I'd like and Juice It Up is more creamy. Smoothie King is more about the fruit and that's particularly refreshing. Each time I have gone the service has been great and we watched our smoothies being made with no problems or concerns."}
{"text":"I used to love this place back in high school, so I decided to drop in for a delicious protein smoothie.  I ordered a medium high protein smoothie, and was absolutely salivating over the upcoming flavor as I hadn't eaten all day.   Well my first disappointment came with the price, a whopping $10.00 for a d*mn medium smoothie! Holy cow! What are they adding to this to make it so god-like you ask? I have no idea, my only add on was friggin peanut butter, which was only a small dollop.   My second complaint was the service, although it wasn't awful, it certainly didn't entice me to ever want to return.   I think I will stick with One Stop Nutrition, I can get the same exact smoothie, with peanut butter, for $5.00.   I'm not trying to bring the gavel down on this place, but they certainly need to double check their prices, I definitely don't taste the quality or see the justification in charging an arm and a leg."}
{"text":"This is my goto! Brittany is fantastic and always has a great suggestion. I'm hooked on the Lean One with pineapple mangos and strawberries now! The service is superior and quick so I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a good summer spot, but I must give a warning about the inconsistency. I could get a smoothie one day and it would be so fruity, delicious, and refreshing, and then I come back another day and order the same thing and the smoothie is watered down or overall less flavorful. These smoothies are a little on the expensive side too, but then again when aren't smoothies. The smallest size available is the 20oz, so you at least get a lot for your money. They do have child sizes but they have a very limited flavors. I really like the Mango-strawberry Re charge, berry carrot dream, and orange kabam."}
{"text":"Not sure why the reviews are saying the staff here aren't friendly because every time I go in the morning, I'm always greeted by Shea (spelling?) and her energy is contagious! Awesome people making awesome smoothies - better than your typical morning coffee!  I usually get the mango pineapple Greek yogurt as a meal replacement for my breakfast - it's on the expensive side ($5.29 for 20 oz) but it tastes good and does the job.   Small parking lot up front but usually don't have an issue finding space in the morning."}
{"text":"Yummy! I have tried this location twice now, I'm new to the area. The selection is quite vast with a little something for everyone. Each time the employees are very nice, and seem to like their job. I do have to consider this a treat, due to the prices. I have paid about six bucks each time for a small, each time skipping the \"boost\" add in because it adds another dollar. The boosts are vitamins or protein blends to add more nutrition. I was pleased with the flavor and texture, just seem a bit sweet. But you have to consider, fruit and sherbet are quite sweet on their own. They also offer small packaged snacks (clif bars, protein cookies, pirates booty, etc) and health supplements. My only gripe is that you can't add a tip when you pay with plastic, so bring a buck or two to leave a tip for great service."}
{"text":"The worst service possible(super slow) They only had 1 person working and it took 35min to get a smoothie. I told myself I would never come back until I tasted the smoothie. Wow it was delicious. This review hopefully will help get more staff so we can enjoy the great taste and not sit waiting 35min."}
{"text":"The prices are still way too high at this smoothie chain, but the $5 Friday banner caught my eyes as I was cruising past the place recently. All mediums are 5 bucks plus tax and normally they would be over $7 on most drinks. For $5 you can barely get a small on any other day. I had some tropical concoction with mango, papaya, sherbert and a banana of course. The smoothie had flavor, tasted good and refreshing and good quick service. Not opposed to this place, but likely only on Friday or until that deal expires."}
{"text":"First time in Arizona and tried this place after the Camelback hike. Skipped Starbucks to come here and glad I did! $5 fridays for 32oz is soooo worth it. It tastes healthier too. Extra points for being able to add extras for no added cost! The workers were super nice and helpful too with recommendations! Definitely recommend if you're in the area! They're the king for a reason!"}
{"text":"I Love SMOOTHIE KING and wish we had one here in Tucson. Whenever I am in the Phoenix area, I always make it a priority to stop by at this location and refuel with a healthy treat. I also like the wide variety of smoothies to choose from. The store and customer service is always great and friendly!! Keep up the great job, and sure to see you all soon!!  Rick"}
{"text":"Good selection service.   They have products for weight gain, weight loss energy boost, as well as pre and post workout. I step in here regularly after working out at anytime fitness.  Call ahead and have it waiting for you when you get there!"}
{"text":"Came in here in between work shifts, the guy at the register (cam I believe he said) was super knowledgeable and very respectful. Knew exactly what I was looking for and was constantly smiling."}
{"text":"Quick service, great smoothies. Good deals on certain days of the week, (like $5 32. Oz). Some room inside to sit as well, which is nice."}
{"text":"Start with correct customer service. I rushed all the way over here to make it by 8:45pm as their website listed they are open until 9pm, only to see the shop closed and the doors outside stating 8pm. Getting the times correct should be the bare basics and a simple thing you'd think of when running a business. Sad to see I'm not the only one who's had an issue similar to this here."}
{"text":"This is pretty much the only straight up smoothie shop in the Madison area. Sure you can get two or three options at some fast food spots and even orange Julius inside of the DQ. But Smoothie King knows what's up.  It's my hangover cure and my energy boost. I prefer these guys to getting a coffee at Starbucks. Smoothie King also offers other nutritional products, though, I haven't really seriously browsed their collection."}
{"text":"I can hardly contain my excitement, we FINALLY have a Smoothie King back in the neighborhood!!! We had one when I was growing up and it moved about 10 years ago. My favorite has always been and always will be the Angel Food smoothie! It has strawberries, bananas, non-fat milk, vanilla, and turbinado. It is so creamy and delish! You can also order it \"skinny\" to take off a few calories. AND for a limited time only, their 32oz smoothies are only $5 on Fridays!"}
{"text":"Really sweet customer service! The two employees working were very accommodating and had great recommendations for my vegan diet. Will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"You can taste the powder in some of the smoothies. Service was good today, other days it is a real struggle.  $5 Fridays is pretty sweet."}
{"text":"Stopped in to check it out because it's next door to my nail salon. It's a very good place, and I happen d to hit it on $5 Friday.   My Very Berry smoothie is delicious and refreshing. I can't wait to stop here before work in the summertime. I think it will be the perfect treat.  The man working the counter was super friendly and efficient too. Great place."}
{"text":"I love this Smoothie King, especially on $5 Fridays. I always receive great customer service. Arren in particular provides helpful recommendations and always makes me feel welcomed."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Smoothie King and this one is in such a convenient location! Most days it's a wee bit pricey but totally worth it. $5 and $6 32 oz smoothies on Fridays! I'd highly recommend any of the Greek yogurt meal replacements!"}
{"text":"I did not like the flavor   Takes to much like yogurt. The staff was not friendly. I like Tropical Smoothie better"}
{"text":"Finally, Fort Mill has a Smoothie King!  The address on Yelp says Tega Cay, but close enough.  I have been a fan of Smoothie King for years.  If I order a smoothie from any other place, it is never as good.  This Smoothie King is similar to the other ones.  It's clean and efficient and the smoothies are good with a lot of options to choose. They also have the nutritional snack items and supplements for sale.  The only thing I would ding them for is that they still use styrofoam cups."}
{"text":"I came in with my 9-year-old daughter who just had 4 teeth extracted at the dentist. She had been looking forward to a Smoothie for \"lunch\" since the night before. When we arrived at 10:30 am she was extremely parched because she had not had food or water since 9:00 the night before. I asked the employee (manager, I think) for a small cup of water for her while we looked at the menu. He replied by pointing to the kids menu and promptly welcoming the next customer, turning away from us and NOT giving her a cup of water. My daughter was holding back tears so I promptly headed to the car to round up an old, partially used water bottle for her. Needless to say I will never bring my business to THIS Smoothie King, which is unfortunate since we live 3/4 of a mile away!"}
{"text":"Very nice ppl  They work fast , very clean .  Good prices  They take orders over the phone and will mix anything you want in drink"}
{"text":"Wow EXPENSIVE!! $19 for two large with one booster. Good but not $9 good!! Very disappointed. And so glad we didn't buy for a bunch of kids.   Another huge factor - I can't stand it when there are no prices online! That is just rude."}
{"text":"Staff was really friendly and helpful. I'll come back again. I see complaints about staff but it must have been different people working on those days."}
{"text":"I look forward to the days I get my Angel Food smoothie with no turbinado. Ever since I started drinking smoothie king I am unable to really enjoy jamba juice smoothies. Right up my alley."}
{"text":"The second smoothie king I went to because of my friends.  I highly recommend this place. I usually go to this the Middleton one but  when I'm on this side of town which is like 25%% of time otherwise I'll go to this one. If you like to actually taste the fruit go to the one in Fitchburg. If you like the one there it's less fruit choose the one in Middleton"}
{"text":"Tasty Treats and Friendly Service  The service was great... The guy and girl were both friendly yesterday. They made good recommendations and I liked my smoothie quite well.   I like that you can get a 40 ounce smoothie here which is my size!   They have a more unique array of smoothie flavors than some of the regular places. It lets you break out of the normal smoothie flavor box and experience something new.   All in all a good spot if you are over that way and need to feed your inner animal!"}
{"text":"As the other reviewer (Kate) said, this place is ALWAYS understaffed.  We live in the area and have gone here around 10-12 times since they opened.  Well over 1/2 the time they don't have enough employees to help the number of customers.  Good smoothies (like any smoothie king) but the manager/owner better get the staffing correct or they are going to continue to lose business.  Witnessed 2-3 families walk out today because of the delays.  And I know our personal family will be heading to other places for our smoothies moving forward.  On a positive note, the one and only employee (Jose) did an amazing job of working as quickly as possible. Made 15 smoothies in the 25 minutes that I was there.  Whatever he makes, it was not enough for the amount of effort he put in."}
{"text":"This has got to be the WORSE location. I have been here like 3 times and they are always closed. I don't understand why hours are posted when they don't follow them. I am going to complain to the corporate location. Don't support this location!"}
{"text":"Well i have definitely had better smoothie's and the Staff while friendly seemed a bit stressed. The guy making the smoothies i think owned the franchise and the girl that was working for him didn't really seem interested in selling smoothies as she was trying to sell other products in the store. I had a strawberry malt...which was not bad which is why i did give it 3 stars rather than 2. My wife had the Pineapple, Strawberry, Kiwi, with protein smoothie. I tried it and i didn't really think any protein was in it....but wife did and she enjoyed and i guess that is all that matters...LOL  The other major problem was the price...a small cost about 5.00 for my malt and the smoothie was close to 4 bucks. You can get a large one for that price at Jamba Juice and while the products at Smoothie King are all-natural that is still expensive. So if you want a decent smoothie for the price go to Jamba Juice...if you want all natural, expensive but decent smoothies then go to Smoothie King. Eat, Drink and be Merry my friends!!!!"}
{"text":"I came in and got a small smoothie that I paid $5.20 for. A small. I was expecting something amazing with produce grown from the Gods but I ended up with a sugary drink blended with juice in it. Next time I'll go to Jamba Juice but the staff was nice and they sell these cookies I can't find hardly anywhere. I'll return for the cookies."}
{"text":"My wife went to this location at around 8:40pm. Your website says you dont close until 9pm. As she was walking up to your door, an employee went to the door to lock it and then ran back. I've called the store and never heard back from anyone. I guess that's just how you do business... by losing what you could get. Needless to say your lack of response speaks volumes and we will not be going back."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to Smoothie King. I prefer it over Jamba Juice, easily. They have more options and I feel like the drinks are healthier. Plus you get what you pay for. And the people who work here are really nice. Other than the parking lot, I love everything about this place and have recommended it to multiple people."}
{"text":"$5 Friday is the best deal going. The Vanilla Hulk tastes great and is very filling. The service is always prompt and helpful. I have interacted with the owner and manger. They always have been friendly. The app also provides good deals and allows you easily to earn free smoothies."}
{"text":"Very clean fast! Love all the smoothies there! This location has $5 40oz smoothies on Friday! Yay!"}
{"text":"Pineapple breeze is like crack.  Amazing.  Friday is a good day to visit, 5 buck deal.  So rare to find a DEAL these days..."}

{"text":"Pineapple breeze is like crack.  Amazing.  Friday is a good day to visit, 5 buck deal.  So rare to find a DEAL these days..."}
{"text":"Fitness Blends. Slim Blends. Wellness Blends. And even Blends to Take a Break! By far THE BEST place to get a smoothie in town, and fantastic customer service as well. If you haven't been in, you're missing out. Each smoothie really does serve a specific purpose.   I can always count on my smoothie to be so yummy and guilt free!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. The staff does not ignore the customers but engages in conversation while your smoothie is being made. The smoothies are great too and you get good value for your $$"}
{"text":"We really like some of their smoothies.   They can be very flavorful and they are always well made.   We focus more on the few that don't have banana in them. We feel they are fairly priced but some may find them more expensive than they would like."}
{"text":"Hours show open till 7 but the homemade signage listed 3pm. 3pm!!!! That's not king behavior."}
{"text":"I get smoothies here about once a week and buy large orders (25+) for my office. They genuinely make the best smoothies.  Lots of options for flavors.  What I like best is the consistency of their smoothies. They are very smooth and don't have chunks of ice or fruit that hasn't been blended."}
{"text":"I love this place. Good smoothies that actually have some nutritional value to them! The staff at this location was super friendly and helpful! I love that they have milk alternatives and you can add/substitute things in your smoothie. Come in on a Friday to get a large size for 5 bucks!"}
{"text":"Don't know if this guy is the owner or manager but he has some issues somewhere. I had gone into this location a few no. Back and he was going in on a young girl who worked for him and he was just chastising her. I was thinking maybe it's his kid. Hopefully she quit. So I go back  a few weeks ago and I was wearing my Co. Shirt the first girl who spoke was kind of dry so I was thinking bad day? So she went to the back. The other lady that was there had seen my shirt and asked me what do I do and she asked about how things work as far as the service we provide. The store was empty at this time and the drink was being blended. So while we were still talking the same guy who was going in on the other girl the last time ,comes out of the back and gives her the slash throat sign to stop talking and tells her \"no\" What the ? Ok so he stopped the conversation and she gave me my drink and I left. I was really bothered by that. No one was in the place. I will not go back ever. If that's how he treats the employees like that no one is going to stay. I'm thinking about letting people know at You Fit about his antics. He has to understand that sometimes the employees can make an average product better just by there personality."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now, not bad service,  seems like when you walk in they expect you to know exactly what you want or they kind if sigh when your perusing the rather large menu.   I was looking at the so called \"muscle maker\" type shake but it only had 5 grams of protein in it, didn't make too much sense to me.  Being a guy who is in decent shape and above average build I think it should have a bit more protein in it.  Then he said you can add more protein if you like which brings it up to about 35 grams.  Good idea I guess.  The other shakes are delicious though, I usually get the Acai/blueberry mixture.   All in all it is a good place to get a refreshing smoothie or meal replacement."}
{"text":"They make smoothies.  Can a smoothie ever be bad?"}
{"text":"The workers decided to start closing 30 minutes before that actual closing time. One girl was mopping and one girl was in the back stocking. There was a line of 7 people waiting in line. A total of 15 minutes went by before I was even address (mind you I was first in line). I was addressed only due to me asking them if they were going to help us & if they noticed we were standing there. I recommend you going 1 hour after they open & 1 hour before they close, because God forbid they actually work they're posted hours."}
{"text":"If you want to be treated rude by the staff and enjoy sub par smoothies then this is the place for you.   I love smoothies and had never been to a Smoothie King and was in the area so decided to give it a try.  Big Mistake!!  When I entered the store there was an older man towards the front and a younger girl making smoothies towards the back.   The place only had about two people in it.   No greeting given by the older man at the front.   The menu here is very, very hard to decipher.   The menu board is so discombobulated you don't know what end is up.   It lists the name of the smoothie for example, \"Cranberry Cooler\" or \"Immune Builder\" but they don't list what is in these smoothies.    You have to look at a \"to-go\" menu to have the smoothie ingredients explained.   I asked the older man what was in the \"electrolyte mix\" (as this was listed as part of the ingredients in a smoothie I was considering)  his answer to me was \"ARE YOU KIDDING?\"   \"You have electrolytes in your body.  They are minerals\"    I have no idea why I even continued with my order after this rude treatment.   Anyway,  I ordered a \"Light and Fluffy\" smoothie.    Basic ingredients;  OJ, Banana, Strawberry.   It was average at best.     On the expensive side too.  Over $5.00 for a small.   Sorry for the long review but this place deserves only one star."}
{"text":"Awesome selection of healthy and fun smoothie options.  What a great service team! Try the peanut butter chocolate protein drink or any of the veggie options. Fast, friendly and healthy!!"}
{"text":"Pros: smoothies are good. I recommend the chocolate gladiator protein smoothies with banana and peanut butter and carribean way.   Cons: They said they are open on Sunday's (on their door sign and here on Yelp) at 9:00am however when I went there 9:32am they were not there. False hours. Drove 15mins so wasted my damn time. Also, when they were open, guy working was kind of rude. Did not even say hi or welcome. Just asked what I wanted and seemed annoyed when it took me awhile to think of what I wanted to order."}
{"text":"Service service service! Shay-linn was out of this world amazing! She is kind and happy and makes my morning better no matter what! When I come in she calls me \"the hero without a cape\" and she makes me feel like 1million bucks. Now the smoothies they are always helpful when I'm feeling like i can't make a choice. The smoothies are always smooth ;) and delicious. I would come back to just for the service but the smoothies are a bonus! Keep up the great work here with your team Shay-linn! Come try them out. They are lucky to have the people here."}
{"text":"Prices are a-typical to these kind of places. Five bucks for a small smoothie. They do taste better than at Jamba Juice and I appreciate being able to see the caloric intake for my choices. Downsize is the ever rotating, under trained staff who are 90% high schoolers who clearly don't want to be at work. Last time I was in there I stood at the register in front of the board for a full five minutes before even being acknowledged. The young lady was helping a client but she was three feet away from me and looked in my direction several times. A smile and a \"I'll be right with you\" goes a long way. If it wasn't for craving an acai adventure I would have left after the lack of customer service.  It's not always like this and that's why I'll return"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  I was sharing my smoothie with my kids and wasn't sure if the protein was a good fit for the kids or not, the cashier did not know and did not have any recommendations.  Everyone that worked there truly acted like it was first day on the job. I was the only customer there and it took forever for them to get me my smoothie.  The taste of the smoothie was meh. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I love this place. The people are always nice to work there and the smoothies are tasty and ingredients are fresh. Everything is always really clean. Definitely a good spot to check out"}
{"text":"Checked online and it says that they close at 9pm. Drove 20 minutes here, arrived at 8:30pm and their doors were locked, lights out and empty. A girl that clearly worked there walked out from the kitchen then walked back in after seeing us. Rude?! Change your hours online and I'll change my 1 star review!!!! #HangryNoCarbsGirl"}
{"text":"Great smoothies. Lots of options - almost too many to make a decision. But very tasty and great protein options."}
{"text":"I meet a running group Saturday mornings at the church across the street from this Smoothie King and I audibly gasped several months ago when I saw it had opened. Funny thing is I didn't stop in until today.  I'm not sure how long ago the location in Old Town closed, but I used to love it and frequented it. I was sad when it went bye-bye.  This location is just like I remembered. There's several smoothies that I like and there's a ton of variety. Some of my favorites include Angel Food, Peach Slice Plus & Power Punch. I actually got something new today. I forget what it was called, but it was simply the one where you pick a fruit (I went with mango), nonfat yogurt, vanilla, and like one or two other things.   Luckily it wasn't very crowded when I popped in. Like someone else mentioned, there's only two employees working at a time and I can see where things can get backed up if it's busy.   I also noticed they do a thing on Fridays where 32 ounce smoothies are $5. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I love this place, but I went to this location at 2pm today and the gentlemen that attended me and my boyfriend was rude. I didn't catch his name, but his attitude was negative. When I asked to add kiwi and mango unto my smoothie, he looked at me with a disgusting face. He seemed like he wasn't having a good day or he was upset of bothered by something, because he did not have Positive attitude towards us. The customer service was disappointing. The smoothies taste bizarre. It tastes like if it was watered down. I'm disappointed because me and my boyfriend love this place, but today wasn't good."}
{"text":"First time here was today. I typically get protein smoothies from Whole Foods, but didn't feel like driving the extra few miles, so I figured I'd give this place a shot.  All I can say is yuck! The smoothie tasted horrible - a very distinctive chemical taste and watery. I won't be back."}
{"text":"While I do Love their smoothies, especially the ANGEL FOOD which consists of Strawberries,Banana & Protein powder, The prices leave you feeling a bit \"ripped off\" 7.00 & change for a Medium? Really?"}
{"text":"They mix good drinks at this location. Most of the group seems to be friendly.  Pricey drinks, but tasty. They also have a variety of snacks and health goods for your choosing."}
{"text":"Phoenix might be in the desert, but it is definitely an oasis for franchises. Smoothie King #1353 just opened on Central Ave and Thomas in a strip mall, situated betwixt bread/bakery and burgers/fries joints. Franchise or not, it'll have to work hard to stand out.   The staff was friendly and gave me some coupons for chocolate smoothies. Could there be such a thing? Ooh yeah! I also picked up a menu and the nutritional guide. Kudos to Smoothie King for having such extensive literature. The company is really aiming for customers who care about what they eat.   Open from 7AM-9PM Monday through Saturday with shorter hours on Sunday so seriously, you could plan your daily meals. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Just be wary of the sugar and request no turbinado.   Unfortunately, during my visit the sensory perception was not picking up any love. There was no sweet smell of fruit in the air. I miss that! What I saw were a lot of small packaged nutritional products for sale.  And, it was white everywhere. The whole place was white...like The Matrix construct. Yo! My residual self image was trying to make sense of it all. \"Welcome to the desert of the real smoothie.\" I'm pretty sure Morpheus was there.  Then, in my head, I heard the operator say, \"What do you need?\"  \"Smoothies,\" I said, \"Lots of smoothies.\""}
{"text":"The smoothie was really good and I feel their prices are very reasonable. You can tell from their menu and product offerings that they know what they are doing. The seating is also very comfortable."}
{"text":"I love Smoothie King! I wish Arizona had more locations and the store hours were a bit longer. I'm used to them closing around 9/10pm in Houston. Nonetheless great smoothies! Rewards program is super beneficial. Definitely a favorite spot for healthy options!   Try the Green tea tango smoothie with mango fruit!"}
{"text":"Owner is rude!  Will never go back here again.  I will make sure to let people know.   Worst customer service ever!"}
{"text":"I will drive out of my way everyday to come to smoothie king. Shae is helpful and sweet and very attentive"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and it's definitely going to be my new go to smoothie place. First off, the blonde young woman who was working was so sweet and cheerful. Like if you were having a bad day, she would make it better. It was my first time so she gave me lots of info about her favorite smoothies and customer favorites. Secondly, it was a Friday, so they have 32oz smoothies for $5.... this is amazing to me!!! It's like $7 for a small at jamba... and the smoothie is so good!!! So I will be here every Friday lol. It is full of fresh flavors and is very refreshing."}
{"text":"I went to Smoothie King for the first time the other day. It was quite busy on a Saturday afternoon and there was only one man working. He did an awesome job though handling the customers and making all the drinks. My smoothie was delicious! It was a fair price for the size of the drink, as well."}
{"text":"First time here. In town for a couple of hours from Cali. Needed a pick me up. This was awesome. Had a pineapple drink, OMGOSH!! It was so good! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The Management/franchise owners are really missing the mark here...always crowded on Saturday and Sunday mornings with one or two employees busting their humps trying to accommodate all the guests. NOT good for business, people (including myself) turn around and walk right out the door when it's that busy. 20mins for a smoothie is not worth."}
{"text":"I walked into this place for the first time. I felt unwelcome by the employees. They didn't greet their customers including myself or made contact. I was not familiar with the menu & did not know where to choose from. I decided to leave & an employee said \"thank you for coming\". Bad first impression, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This smoothie queen really enjoys her Smoothie King. In fact, at one time, we were quite the couple. I lived around the corner from this one, and you couldn't keep me away from his royal juices. So sweet. So ripe. So. So. Well, um....so blended. Yea, blended. Add a shot of wheat grass? Sure, why not. It will only make me friskier Smoothie King. What? A shot of triple Vitamin C. Bring it your majesty. I shall have increased stamina. And while your at it, throw in a bag of those all natural peanut butter filled pretzels. And while I'm waiting I'll peruse your homeopathic book, the size of an armchair, and get the latest on colon cleansing, liver detox and why your poop should be in the shape of an \"s\". Thank you Smoothie King. For making this smoothie queen feel like a young, healthy princess once again!"}
{"text":"Bad quality. Ordered a carrot berry smoothie and they poured in a bunch of syrups and a lot of ice. Just a whole lot of sugary water. I ended throwing away the entire contents. Spent nearly 10 $ of a glass of some very unhealthy sugary stuff."}
{"text":"Three stars is average. And that's not bad. It's just not a wow. You won't be disappointed in the product. The shakes taste pretty good although they are a bit sugary to me. But, they are not amazing. The staff is always friendly at least. They do have a nice range of extra products in the store such as supplements and protein/energy bars. One thing that could get this review to 4 stars is if they revamped their iPone app. It's pretty terrible and provides no real assistance to the in-store  experience."}
{"text":"Chocolate shredder with peanut butter is the way to go. Wish they had extended business hours... back home smoothie king is super popular and opens at 5a... would love to hit here before work but for now I'll swing by on the weekend!"}
{"text":"I love this place. All the shakes are geared towards being healthy unlike Jamba Juice. And many contain 300 or less calories in the 20 oz size. The staff was great in making suggestions and explaining their supplement/protein options.  I ordered the Island Impact which already comes with protein in it, and it was delicious. Will be back again next time I'm in town for sure!"}
{"text":"Although the smoothies are quite delicious, it is FAR from natural. Everything is frozen and preserved, i've noticed. This pisses me off! They advertise like they are healthy and support the customer's well being when in reality they're just sticking all this sugar down our throats. I soon realized after I ordered my drink (for the first time) that it had about 800 calories for a small and 70 grams of sugar!! Not so healthy if you ask me.   The management is corrupt. They always made the poor employees work alone and although it would get incredibly busy, they didn't seem to mind. This comes across as SELFISH, and I refuse to support a company that operates in such a way. In addition to this, Sean (tall black guy) would always try hitting on me, he has made uncomfortable remarks and he was VERY unproffessional. He would stand and talk to me for hours and I CANNOT deal with that when I have obligations to address on a daily basis. This made me dread coming into Smoothie king. Overall this place is trash, I definatley wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Went to walk up at 8:06 and the guy was running out. Closed early and I drove 25 minutes out here. Super upset. Never making that drive again."}
{"text":"Good smoothies, poor service. The woman behind the counter was very rude, and difficult when placing an order."}
{"text":"Good variety of delicious smoothies!  Tip:  You can order your smoothie \"skinny\" which means they don't add sweetener. According to the nutrition guide, this saves you 100 calories and 24 grams of sugar."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have Smoothie King in the 'hood. I'm not so happy about using so much styrofoam. I purchased a Smoothie King blender bottle for the sake of sustainability, but when it's crowded, it's hard to know when to offer my reusable bottle. Maybe this is a corporate issue, but please pass the feedback along. We need recyclable or compostable cups."}
{"text":"I love Smoothie King!!   I used to both live and work right down the road from this particular Smoothie King, so it was a frequent stop for me. In the morning as breakfast, or mid-day as a snack, or when my work folks were in need of a pick-me-up to get through the day: Smoothie King hit the spot in all ways.   I love that they have such a variety of options from very health conscious to I just want a sweet treat. It fits in almost anyone's diet! The Kale and Carrot (yeah doesn't sound awesome, I know) is my all time FAVORITE! Not too sweet, but not like drinking dirt either. It is really very yummy.  I have since moved to the East Side of Madison and I miss Smoothie King sooo much!!! It really blows my mind that there is nothing over here, nor in Sun Prairie!   Please, someone, anyone! Open a franchise closer to me! I will spend lots of money there, I promise :)"}
{"text":"With a name like Smoothie King, I was hoping to find smoothie worthy of a crown! What I got was a mediocre blend of frozen yogurt, a fruity syrup, and protein powder. I didn't care for it, and the stryfoam cup it came in is disappointing to my environmentalistic side. The store definitely had the chain, mass-produced feeling. However, there was quite an extensive menu, so, for a smoothie lover like me, I suppose this joint is worth more than one shot."}
{"text":"Ordered a small Yogurt D-Lite, the person originally seemed a little over the edge and over worked.  The drink was good but was pricy.   As she was done completing the drink she seemed to be better.  Overall drink was good but the price is on the expensive side."}
