{"text":"I've worked in this area for years and just came across this gem.  8 of us in the office ordered and everyone was very very pleased.  Ordered to go can be a nightmares and some places...not here!  The bartender made sure everything was right and labeled everything.   The bar was very clean inside and had a large selection of beer/booze   They have Keno and a bunch of TVs.     I will definitely be back."}

{"text":"Very impressed with this place. It's a clean, nice neighborhood bar with great prices. I ordered a bunch of fried food and it was \"real\" food - not just frozen stuff dropped in a deep fryer. There were two ladies and a guy working, and all were super friendly. I was there for happy hour and it did get fairly busy. I will definitely return!"}
