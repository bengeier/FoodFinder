{"text":"The brass monkey is by far the best pub in south calgary. Small great food unbeatable prices and everyone is friendly. Open mike Wednesdays and karaoke Fridays are a blast. I for one along with many other people will not go anywhere els. And I don't even live In the area. Mike and mark the owners like to have fun with the pub goers and are friendly and it's just a great place to be. Wings in Monday and Wednesday are the best wings I have had."}
{"text":"Recently visited with neighbors, as much as we enjoy Jias we were very disappointed with the food. Two poorly cooked duck breasts. The crab cakes were good. I ordered a salad and asked for it repeatedly during the meal and it arrived after being told three times the chef was making it. Doubt we will return . Will keep Jias at the top of our dining choices."}
{"text":"Really great prices and amazing food. We had the special Thursday tacos which were very yummy plus the homemade lager chips really really good!!! Friendly staff. Highly recommend this if you are looking for a pub night out."}
{"text":"Wow.  I had such a good meal at The Brass Monkey last night.  The menu is diverse in both price and selection.  The kids menu is also really good.  We started with the calamari.  It was large, tender rings with a delicious, light breading.  Off the kids menu,my daughter, a mac and cheese lover, got the mac and cheese and I added chicken to it (it is an option on the pasta kids meal).  It wasn't the blue box, not that we don't eat that too, but it was refreshing to see a kids mac and cheese which is made with a roux.  My son got the sliders and fries.  The fries were delicious!  It comes with 3 sliders and the meat is not junk.  It was flavorful and cooked to medium. My husband got the shrimp and grits. He said they were good but on the side of ok.  I didn't try as I am allergic.  I got the Parmesan Crusted Salmon with the corn risotto and saut√©ed bok choy.  It is outstanding.  The risotto is creamy, flavorful and mellow.  The bok choy is cooked to perfection and very tasty.  The salmon is creamy with a tasty crust.  We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We came just out of chance based on Yelp! Reviews.  Food was freshly prepared. The scallops and hangar steak were well seasoned and beautifully presented. Service by Charlie was excellent. There were two large grips that came in and we were able to get our order ahead of them. We will return."}
{"text":"By far one of the best places locally. You can definitely tell they use fresh ingredients. Will be going back!"}
{"text":"This pub has a great crowd and great food specials. $1 tacos can't be beat. Also love their karaoke night."}
{"text":"Nice new restaurant on Gastonia offering a varied menu with some great choices. I have eaten the crab cakes which were surprisingly good. Also try to Mac& cheese as a side it is excellent. Staff is friendly and accommodating. Flatbread pizzas are great as well, they have duck and lobster pizza!"}
{"text":"The food is wonderful and the staff is very pleasant. Don't expect this to be a fast meal, typically we are there for close to 2 hours for dinner."}
{"text":"The food was great! The mac and cheese was my favorite. Probably the best mac and cheese I've ever eaten. I got the Carolina burger, it comes with pimento cheese, greens, pickles (I think they were house made), pork belly, and a barbecue sauce. The beef itself had a great flavor.   My only suggestion is some music! It was a little quiet."}
{"text":"Seems like this place is being run by a couple of teen kids. The veal porter house was awful. Service was slow and waiter had no clue about what he was selling. Maybe they will get things together later. But not worth the money at this time. Left here hungary and frustrated."}
{"text":"We ran into Brass Monkey for a late lunch. We were the only customers there,  which was a little scary. We were greeted by a friendly young lady and seated right away.  After reviewing the menu,  we chose the lunch special soup Broccoli and Cheese for $1.99 and the Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Roll. 2 for $8.95. Everything arrived promptly. The soup was served with toast points and was delicious.  The Summer Roll was served with a great Thai sweet chili and hoisin sauce. With two sweet teas, our bill was $18.00. Great food at a reasonable price. We will go again !"}
{"text":"This restaurant's food made me want to cry.  They put marinara sauce on a panini and called it \"tomato jam\". WET SANDWICHES SUCK.  I'm told they are getting a new chef and/or owner.  Let me say NO chef ever stepped foot in their kitchen.  A cook perhaps but not a chef.    I tried their food twice.  Will not go again till assures their are changes"}
{"text":"I have been coming to The Brass Monkey about once a week since they changed chefs, and my goodness...this place is outstanding! I have yet to try something here that I didn't thoroughly enjoy. The southwest chicken egg rolls and mussles are great starters, and I'm a huge fan of their Kobe burger, as well as the duck breast for entrees. But my favorite dish there would most definitely have to be the Parmasian Salmon! It is served with a sweet corn rissoto, and both the entry and side have wonderful flavors that make you want to just keep on eating! Our server, Kayla, was very polite and attentive. She did an excellent job of making us feel welcome, and had some great recommendations for some of our party's first-timers! Highly recommended to anyone who is looking for a high quality dining experience for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Did not have high hopes but was blown away by the Parmesan crusted salmon (the special). Salmon was cooked medium on the rare side, exactly how I ordered it, and the taste -- from the first bite to the last -- was exquisite. The sweet corn risotto upon which it was served was excellent, and the haricot verts were crunchy and fresh. Partner had the wings and kale Caesar and was similarly approving. Service was great, although it was not a busy night so can't say how it would be if the place were slammed. Can't wait to go back. Could this be the next great restaurant in Gastonia?"}
