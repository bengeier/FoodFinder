{"text":"I really enjoy this spot! Great staff and the food is pure comfort. The price is right too. I recommend the strawberry juice, and the corn soup."}
{"text":"Amazing service and fantastic food equals fabulous experience! We had a group of 7 and the staff took great care of us"}
{"text":"We had dinner here, 3/29/16, our first night visiting Toronto. My daughter had her first ever bison burger and really enjoyed it, especially the fry-bannock roll. I had an elk-venison steak on fry bannock and the Three Sisters soup (corn, squash, green & wax beans in a broth with fresh herbs and carrots). Both our entrees came with a mayo-based coleslaw. I also sampled the Labrador tea.  The soup was definitely the best thing we ordered and I wish I'd had a bowl instead of a cup. The elk was surprisingly tender and very flavorful. Portions were so large that we didn't get dessert. My daughter was a bit disappointed to find out after she'd ordered that the fresh strawberry juice was unavailable after all. The restaurant is decorated with various First Nations historical items, images, and a large (handpainted) outline map on one wall. There was a soothing flute and drum CD playing. Service was slow, but we were given a nice bowl of freshly popped corn to nibble while we waited. Everything is cooked from scratch so it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"I loved the decor and the food was great. The bannock was not as dry or hard as scones and is worth trying. The trout burger was really good and would recommend having as your main."}
{"text":"Nice experience in there. It's my first time try Indian taco, it's like a chilli with salad on top of a fry bread, fresh and delicious. And the soup is amazing, made of fresh corn, carrot, green bean, onion, pepper and some herbs, it tasted healthy and fresh, I love it...."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. We came in around 6:30 on a Wednesday night.  We ordered the bison burger, salmon burger, bannock taco and a pickerel dish between the four of us. The server kept forgetting the settings and our orders.  He gave us popcorn as an appy that he grabbed with his hands from the big bowl in the kitchen.  The bison burger patty was not cooked through being quite red.  Ground meat needs to be cooked through!  Obviously the patty was frozen and was just seared.  The salmon was dry. The taco was covered with a tepid, ill-tasting sauce that I suspect was from a can.  The pickerel was pan-fried and was as dry as the salmon. Mashed potatoes for the pickerel were cold.  The coleslaw was sloppy and very watery.   My wife got the wrong tea drink.   To top it off were given the wrong bill. There was only one other group there besides us.  I cannot recommend this restaurant at all."}
{"text":"What a great place! We had the blanket dogs, three sisters soup with blueberry and raisin pies. Everything was beautifully made and oh so delicious! We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place has great food and terrific prices. We had the corn soup and tacos. I couldn't shove the tacos in my mouth fast enough. The corn soup was great with big chunks of hominy and a tasty broth.   Service was good once the serving staff showed up...apparently they were late so the cook was serving which resulted in a bit of slowness but we weren't there for a fast food experience so it didn't bother us. The decor is pleasant. I will certainly be returning."}
{"text":"be careful not to miss this place. when I found it by referral and never suspected that little gem. the staff is extremely friendly and the food very good. we tried their special which was Bison roast and the salmon. all was cook perfectly, well arranged and very tasty. I want to go again to try their other dishes. they also have a little white/chalk board for the kids."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! My husband and I were visiting Toronto for the first time and we happened upon this little place. We'd never tried First Nations food, so we were excited to give it a go. The service is so warm and friendly, very cozy atmosphere. But let's get down to it: I swear, this place has the best salmon I've ever tasted in my life. Melts in your mouth. Perfectly cooked/seasoned. The wild rice is no joke, either. I mean, we were literally picking up every last grain of it with our fingers lol. My first time trying bannock and it is definitely good comfort food! Seriously, just go. Excellent food that straight up tastes like it was home cooked. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"While riding my bike through a rainy afternoon, I took refuge in this quaint little cafe/bistro. I was drawn in by the teepee, not going to lie, but I'm glad I was. The atmosphere was great, the wait staff incredibly attentive and sweet and the food was exactly what I needed on a rainy summer day. The corn soup was good, the bannok was better but the wild rice salad was by far the best. Looks like I've found my staple in the east end!"}
{"text":"Although I really wanted to like this place because it had a rather quaint and unique atmosphere, it just didn't blow me away in any aspect.  Upon walking in no one greeted me so I went to the counter and asked if I should order there or at the table - to which the woman in the kitchen said either was fine. After perusing the menu and indicating that I was ready, I was then told to take a seat and someone will be with me shortly. Well, OK?  After a while, someone finally came from the kitchen. I really wanted to try the three sisters soup, having heard that it's a classic dish. At first I was informed that they were out and it would take half an hour; but when the food came, it turns out that it was made in time after all. Yay!  Unfortunately, the meal was somewhat underwhelming. The taste was certainly different and interesting in a way, but there was nothing exciting about it - in fact, I felt that everything was a bit bland (and I usually eat on the less salty side). The portions were also on the smaller side considering the price. That being said, they do advertise that the ingredients they use are rather specialized, which could account for the discrepancy. On the other hand I did like that the food was fresh and light and not made with an abundance of heavy oils and such.  Even though I didn't personally feel that the restaurant was super welcoming or friendly, I do want to mention that I overheard the owners having an animated conversation with another pair of customers, perhaps their regulars? It could be that this place just needs some time to grow on me. :)"}
{"text":"I had a trout burger and it was big and delicious!! Great value. Nice friendly staff and great service. I highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"This is great addition to the neighborhood. Serving authentic first nations recipes and specializing in delicious bannock (a fried flat bread sort of like a savory beaver tail).   The fresh soups, like smoked elk or three sisters, are excellent, and the blanket dog (a hot dog wrapped in bannock) is an improved pogo. Habit forming.   The atmosphere is friendly and easy going. Its pretty easy to find yourself striking up a conversation with fellow patrons."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant with food I have not been exposed enough to! My friend and I stopped in for dinner this evening and had a very nice experience. The service was pleasant and the food was well prepared. We shared an appetizer platter, then I had the elk roast and my friend had the meat taco. We finished with blueberry dumplings and a raisin pie. Very tasty - thanks for a nice meal!"}
{"text":"Really good native indian food, the best fried bread I have ever had. Nice atmosphere and the chef took great care of his food.  Friendly service.....I am very happy to find this restaurant and hope to go back very soon!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Yesterday, I tried First Nations food for the first time. I had absolutely no idea a restaurant like this existed in Toronto. We tried the bison burger and the bison stir fry. Both dishes were great, and the complimentary bannock and popcorn added to a very fulfilling meal. In fact, we were quite full after we didn't even finish the bannock!   But not only was the food unique and delicious, the owner was also very friendly and the two of us talked about living and working in northern Ontario.   There were only a few people coming in and out of the restaurant, and I was a bit surprised as to why. I would definitely encourage others to support this local business. It's quite the Canadian gem!"}
{"text":"Having never tried aboriginal food, I don't have a starting point. I'm just a person who loves food prepared well; if you got it, I want it! My partner and I have eaten here twice. I am giving somewhat of a backward review as I'm starting with our second visit. We came back just to eat the salmon sandwich, which has excellent texture and flavour. The salmon has a lovely smokiness without being dry, the bread (fried bannock) has a slight crispiness on the outside while fluffy on the inside (almost like a biscuit), and the mayo, red onion and lettuce are simple but perfect complements.  The first time we ate here, we shared the three sisters soup, I had the salmon plate with wild rice salad on the side, while my partner had the sandwich. Although the soup had corn and beans in it, the third sister (squash) was visibly missing, and the broth was a bit watery and lacking flavour. The salmon on my plate was the same as the sandwich, so no complaints there. The wild rice salad was a little on the sweet side for my taste.   The service is friendly and the venue is quaint, with traditional products near the cash register and decor that reflects the culture. We would go back to try other menu items (or just for the salmon sandwich!)."}
{"text":"Wow, the best salmon I've ever had! A great bbq flavour. Now that I've had the catering I'll be dropping into the restaurant for sure!"}
{"text":"I am working on an aboriginal project in Regent Park and just had to have aboriginal food and this is the place. Aboriginal cooks who treat the kitchen as if it is their own actually means you get scratch cooking.  The corn soup with hominy corn, shredded pork, kidney beans and onions is low cooked. You get a flavorful soup that cannot come from a 50oz can. You need the large $4  Bannock is just their traditional bread, and ask for jam and butter or get their wild blueberry bannock.  There you get a hearty and fresh lunch for $6  I also had a week later the Buffalo Burger. Its actually Bison with the usual fillings and a side of coleslaw. I loved it and better than the one I had in Winnipeg.  I talked to the owner and he does catering so that would be a interesting dinner and would support the local regent park economy.  It is a great restaurant story providing First Nations food, providing jobs for local aboriginals and keeping the culture and spirit alive.   You will just be impressed on how they spent time and effort to decorate the place."}
{"text":"This is an Canadian Indian food restaurant. Food is excellent. Had a Bison stir fry, delicious. Bannock is Indian fried bread the best bread I have ever tasted. Corn soup also amazing. Very friendly staff. Lady there is a sweetheart."}
{"text":"My friend took me here for a late lunch and we sure indulged. I ordered a bison sandwich, we had bannock bread, wild rice salad, she ordered a b sandwich and dessert we had the donuts and bannock bread to take home. Everything came out fresh made to order (don't go if you're in a hurry), they cater, I bought a bottle of their salad dressing, and will certainly go back and support them. We had an hour or so chit-chat with the staff and they were so wonderful .  Recommend if you like me have never tasted or had any idea what aboriginal food is. Their menu gives you a lot of information about the tradition of what you are eating and where it comes from.  I will return!  Bang for buck - absolutely  To be updated"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The Bison burger is great as well as the fish dinner. Very clean and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Wanted to really enjoy this place, however it wasn't really great. Food lacked flavour, and quality. Paying high prices for tea, would have like to see the tea leaves. Felt like it was kind of a money grab."}
{"text":"Lovely spot with attentive and friendly staff and management.  I'm not sure how authentic \"Indian tacos\" are, but I always enjoy myself here."}
{"text":"A lovely place has great feel, delicious First Nation food, nice aboriginal music in the background. Reasonablie prices and servings."}
{"text":"Late Friday afternoon lunch. Delicious and unique food. Love the soups, salads and entrées. The strawberry juice and my Indian tea were delicious. Nice touch with the free Indian popcorn while we waited for our meals."}
{"text":"The food is SO delicious and so affordable. The owner is such a lovely person as well. The bannock is delicious, and the stew is a thumbs up. Always a go-to for me!"}
{"text":"Haven't had bannock in a long time and eating here hit the spot.  Food was great!  fried bannock with blueberry jam is a must."}
{"text":"I'm so impressed with the food! I went there for dinner. Relax environment and very friendly service. Their corn soup is very tasty! And the bread tastes so great that I still remember the taste the next day!! The bison burger is amazing! Definitely a hidden gem in Leslieville! Their opening hours is short (I think until 9pm) and no alcohol but it definitely worth to try. So much better than a lot of higher end restaurant on Queen st"}
{"text":"It's a quaint and casual eating establishment. The food is good and they do a good job of educating people about the culture and sourcing sustainable wild food. The service could be better. Every one was friendly and helpful but needed more training and/or help. I overheard one of the employees mention that they just started providing table service instead of requiring people to order at the counter. I ended up still ordering at the counter because our server, who probably had other responsibilities, didn't come to my table regularly enough. As a result, I also had to ask for water and ended up with two glasses instead of just getting a refill. Over all I do recommend it for the food and experience."}
{"text":"Prices was ok. But we felt a bit nauseous after eating the trapper snack. Meat of the burger was delicious but sides were not good."}
