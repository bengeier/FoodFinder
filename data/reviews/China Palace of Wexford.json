{"text":"Best Chinese food in the area.  The restaurant itself is always clean and well-maintained, the service is always friendly & overly accommodating, & the food is consistently delicious no matter what you order from the menu.  What more do you want?"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese  in the north hills! Lunch is cheap and fresh every time! I visit once a week!  Kung pao is probably the best I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Yummy!

This place is small, but great for a casual date or take-out.

I usually go to the one in Shadyside because it is closer to my house, however my fiancee and I were out running errands and doing some shopping one Saturday in Wexford and decided to try this location. Major win! It was about 7:30-8 on a Saturday night and I say we waited about 15 minutes for our food to go, and they were busy! The people working there were super nice, told us to take our time when we looked at the menu. Unlike the Shadyside location, (which I love, don't get me wrong) this one offers Mongolian Beef and a Crab Rangoon appetizer. The food was sooo good and I had plenty left over to eat the next day.

Delicious!"}
{"text":"You know........There is something to be said about returning to a certain restaurant over and over through the years. Is it just habit? Or could it be that you may have stumbled on to some place special.
I know it's the later. I have visited this restaurant on numerous occasions with family and friends. 
What a unique place. Regardless of what you order, you are in for a very enjoyable experience. Nice atmosphere.  Owner always says hello. Friendly staff. And entrees that always satisfy. Pricing is fair.
So the next time you need to find a place without the stress of not knowing what to expect, the China Palace is a smart choice."}
{"text":"Great fresh prepared food at reasonable prices given quality of ingredients. Immaculately clean, including restrooms which is true tell of any restaurant. Server knowledgeable of menu, excellent service , very attentive yet not intrusive. Owner stopped by table to inquire how meal was.  Delightful woman !  Several regulars stopped in , she called them by name and asked how their family was doing. Awesome! Who does that these days? First time there, will definitely return.  Good prices for lunch specials if in area. Treat yourself !"}
{"text":"Recently moved into Wexford and had to find a new Chinese takeout place. The service and delivery time was very good. Unfortunately the food was over priced and to be honest not so good. Tried it a few times and the last time my Amazing Chicken was more Amazing Batter than anything. 

It's not the worst place to get Chinese food from. If it wasn't 't for the price I'm sure we would stick with it."}
{"text":"This may sound hard to believe given its location and unassuming exterior, but the China Palace in Wexford has arguably the best sushi in Pittsburgh. Owner Mike Chen pays special attention to the freshness and quality of his fish. And his sushi chefs are well trained in not only preparing the fish, but also presenting it in artful ways. Mike also pays special attention to his customers. He, and his staff, make guests feel like they are part of a family.  In addition to fantastic sushi, China Palace has a very nice and well priced wine list and excellent Chinese fair. I recommend the eggplant dumplings. A true gem of the North Hills, and all of Pittsburgh for that matter."}
{"text":"A bit pricy but worth the experience. Excellent cuisine, welcoming attitude and consistent quality. One of our favorites. Nice menu."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese take out I have ever had. Had the 7 wonders of the world. The fried chicken filet was obviously out of a bag, same with the butterfly shrimp. Tough, chewy, flavorless. The sauce had no flavor. I have never thrown an entire meal in the trash before, but did just that. 
My daughters orange chicken was chewy and overly breaded. She said there was barely a hint of orange to it. The wife had Chicken with vegetables. Flavorless. Asked for it to be spicy...it was not. 
Even the soups were no good. Hot and sour was thin and watery, wonton was chewy as well.
The only one in my family who enjoyed his dinner tonight was my 6 year old son. He opted for Chef Boyardee shells and meatballs. 
On a positive note, the volcano roll was passable.
First time back in several years, last time back for ever."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday evening and it was pretty crowded. As a result, I had to wait a little while for the food. After reading some favorable reviews I thought to myself, this had better be good. When my Pork Osso Buco finally arrived I devoured it shortly after first taste. I mean it was absolutely delicious. The meat was tender and the flavor tickled my palate. The manager was also very nice as well. The decor was pleasant and seemed authentic enough. Given that the more important points, being quality of food and service were well covered, I give this place a five star rating."}
{"text":"This was my second time eating here. I came for lunch today. The place was very clean and nicely decorated. Service was excellent. We ordered the palace appetizer from the dinner menu and both had the egg drop soup, sweet and sour chicken and fried rice. The food was perfect temperature and looked as wonderful as it tasted. The prices are really reasonable for all we ate it was about $30. We were both stuffed and took home enough left overs for another light meal. I would eat here more often and I would have given them 5 stars if they had different chairs. The chairs are NOT fat chick friendly. The arms of the chairs really made my thighs uncomfortable. I braved the thigh biters a second time though because the service, food and prices are that good. Give them a try."}
{"text":"The \"special\" Won Ton soup had very little flavor! This restaurant has always been my go-to place for very good food but not the last two visits. Even the spareribs had little taste unless I put on the duck sauce. I am not sure what happened but I am unhappy...."}
{"text":"Definitely best Chinese food in North Hills. Definitely try the firecracker pork and bok choy in garlic sauce. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Excellent fried tofu and vegetables, and a nice crispy spring roll. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"This restaurant combines affordability and a great menu variety.  I had the Beef Lo Mein, which was wonderful. I was dining with someone who has some dietary restrictions, and China Palace was so accommodating! Everyone was very kind, and you couldn't ask for more as far as the service."}
{"text":"New ownership. Food not so good. Meat cut too thick. Sushi was also too thick and chewy as well as warm. Dough on dumplings was thicker than a pierogi. Mr. Chen sold it about a month ago. Might not go back."}
{"text":"Oh wow!  China Palace isn't your run-of-the-mill Americanized Chinese food joint (though there's nothing wrong with places like those).  China Palace is definitely more upscale than your typical $6.95 lunch special joint.  My husband Rick and I met up here with some friends of ours we hadn't seen in awhile.

We started off our meals with some soup.  I tried the hot & sour and--good morning taste buds!  We then moved to the Palace Platter for our appetizers.  The platter is a medley of some of their best--spring rolls, spare ribs, won tons, and coconut fantail shrimp--yum!

Now for the main courses, I love the flowery names here:  Ocean Breeze, Flower Basket Medley, and Happy Family.  I went for the Ocean Breeze:  fried filet of fish with mushrooms and broccoli in chef's special sauce.  Now when eating fried fish, the breading shouldn't overpower the fish.  And nor should the sauce drown the dish.  Trust me, this was done perfectly!  Rick went for the Crystal Gems--seafood, scallops, and chicken in a mix of Chinese vegetables.  Our friends wet for the Peking Duck.

I've eaten at the Shadyside location and as a previous Yelper said, the owner and his staff do a great job at both locations."}
{"text":"We go to this place almost every week, because they have the best Chinese Food in town! Mongolian Beef, Tender Blossom, and Chicken Lettuce Wrap always on our table. My daughter loves the Dragon Roll, and I enjoy the Beautiful Alaska Roll as we'll.  And the Shrimp Lao Main so delicious, whole family love it. We will be continue to visit this place!!!"}
{"text":"Moved to Pittsburgh recently and this is my favorite chinese palace.  I've been to three of them so far, but the food is best here.  Try the eggplant and spicy pepper chicken.  Their convenient parking lot makes it easier to park for take out or dine in."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh - and the sushi is great too (especially the tropical roll and spicy tuna roll made complete with asparagus)! Everything they make is good - the vegetables in each dish seem fresh and crunchy.  Our favorites include the egg rolls & Grand Marnier Shrimp!  The ambiance is nice, and it is great that they have a full bar too."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and very fair prices.  Received a large pot of hot tea and plentiful water refills.  I had the schezwan shrimp and hot sour soup, both were good but could've been better; Portion size is equivalent to low prices.  It was good, but not great.  Would definitely go again to try other items"}
{"text":"The General Tso's chicken and the dry fried string beans were ok - at least they were edible.  The scallops in lobster sauce were swimming in a heavily cornstarched viscous soup with some peas and egg swirled in. The beef with bamboo shoots and black mushrooms was absolutely tasteless -- it is hard to imagine how one can take black mushrooms and make them tasteless, and it used canned bamboo, not  shoots.  The whole menu seemed heavily americanized, but it did not even do the chinese american food well.  This place also refused to honor a discount card, that clearly stated it was good at the China Palace in Wexford and China Palace in Monroeville (but not the one in Shadyside - as the food tasted totally different, they must not be part of the same chain as the one in Shadyside, which is americanized but has several tasty dishes).  Up in this area, the Oriental Express on Brandt School road by Soergels or China Star on McKnight are much, much better."}
{"text":"Find this China Plaza off 19 in Wexford, near the Bairl Chevrolet, smack in the middle of a little strip mall.  I came for lunch and was probably one of the first diners of the day.  

The lighting is dark and there is plenty of seating.  Each table had baskets of fried noodles and duck sauce for snacking on while you wait.  Great, because I was early and the person I was meeting was late.

Lots of standard dishes you'd expect from a Chinese restaurant with some good lunch specials.  Also, there is a sushi bar to choose from.  I had the shrimp in lobster sauce and was pleased.  Prices are very reasonable and service was quick."}
{"text":"Despite delivering to my house for the last three years, they have decided that 2.7 miles is \"too far.\" You guys suck."}
{"text":"Pretty easy to tell if this place is good.  If no chinese person is commenting on here then this place is a waste of your time and money.  Fairly simple.  It's just like when you have Panda Express and Meizhou Dongpo next to each other; and all the non Chinese people go to Panda and while all the Chinese go to Meizhou.  Coincidence,  don't you think!!! 

DISCLAIMER!!  

In no way is this meant to be taken as racist.  It is just stating the facts!! Would you trust a non wine drinker to give you a wine recommendation!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place! There wasn't one item on the menu that wasn't fantastic. However, my sister and I ate here yesterday and it just wasn't the same.  First, we noticed a new menu that had Thai food on it. I was getting kinda suspicious at this point. We got our soup and egg roll and everything seemed ok. Then we got our entrees... I ordered beef and broccoli, my usual for years and my sister ordered her favorite lemon chicken.  My beef has a weird, fake kind of flavor to it.  Not the beef and broccoli I've known and loved for years.  My sisters came out as a single, flattened chicken breast that was kinda sliced.  The sauce on hers was so thick and goopy, it had the consistency jello. Disgusting.  The staff was all new, so I'm pretty sure they got a new owner and thus the chef was different.  So sad, I used to love this place and now it is soo gross (and still expensive).  :("}
{"text":"New owner sucks...not the old China Place that I have been to many time no longer owned by MIchael C.

New owner closes at 10:00 while sign on door clearly says open til 10:30.  Hostess, leftover from old crew was rude.  Much like the reason she was never the hostess under previous owner.

Did enjoy it before sale....I'll never eat, or attempt to eat here again, and is only 1.4 miles from my home.

Totally ignorant to customer arriving  1/2 hour before closing time."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food is always good, the service is friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is clean and welcoming."}
{"text":"Great food, and pricing not bad. Good portions. Friendly staff. If you are in the area this is a place to stop!"}
{"text":"I love their wonton soup the broth is fantastic and so are the wontons. I will only eat Sushi if I get it here and I also LOVE their sesame chicken, lomane, and fried rice. The price is also VERY reasonable! I would defiantly recommend going their!!"}
{"text":"Decent spot for Chinese.  The interior is small, but completely dipped in red, very vibrant.  We have only gotten take out here.  Prices are pretty much in line with what other joints are charging.  Service is quick and somewhat friendly.  Their food does seem to have a bit of a higher quality.  Another plus, they know how to properly cook shrimp.  They never overcook it to make it rubbery.  And their rice even seems to be a bit more fluffy, never sticky.  Our favorite dishes so far are Du Du beef with snow peas, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts and mushrooms and General Tso's Shrimp.

So when we are in the area, this place is a good go to place."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it a 4.5 stars. The only thing I was wishing to have were crab rangoons. Other than that it was wonderful. Best Chinese that I have had in a Very long time. I got the egg roll with my lunch and it was light and mild. The hubby got the wonton soup which was nice (I feel as though it was a little too oniony for me but good). I chose the sesame chicken and fried rice. Really good. Best I have had. The chicken is tender and moist, best I have had at a Chinese restaurant, ever! The hubby got the cashew chicken and it was just as good. Fried rice was excellent as well. Good size portions for lunch. Not too much, just enough to fill you up! Service was amazing as well. Never had an empty water glass and the hot tea they give is relaxing and delightful especially on a chilly, rainy Pittsburgh day! We will certainly go back!"}
{"text":"I'm always looking for great sushi and this place is one of my favorites in the north hills/cranberry area. The selection of speciality rolls is pretty good. My favorite is the crazy tuna roll. The Chinese food is good too. I always make sure to get some chicken fried rice to go. It's delicious heated up the next day. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"General tso tasted like I cooked chicken tenders from a frozen bag from grocery store and lathered it up in sauce.  Tuna rolls weren't chunks of actual tuna, but ground up pieces.  Not the best, and probably won't go back"}
{"text":"The woman at the counter who took my order was so rude, I almost walked out. The food was inedible. The chicken was like rubber and the sauces had zero taste. It was disgusting and went in the trash. Total waste of money."}
{"text":"My family has been eating ad CP for as long as I can remember.  They make very good American style Chinese food that is always fresh and consistently good.  The sushi is good - fresh ingredients, nothing fancy.  (I have yet to find good/excellent sushi in Pittsburgh!!). Service is good if you dine in - excellent for carry out."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten in and ordered  take out from this establishment more times than we can count and have never been disappointed. We've never encountered a wait & the service is polite and conscientious. We really like the sushi and very chill atmosphere. You won't be disappointed."}
