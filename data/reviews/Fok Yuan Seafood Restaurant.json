{"text":"First impressions walking in isn't the greatest but I have heard quite a few good reviews about this restaurant so I gave it a try. I went with my family. The place isn't decorated. it looks pretty old and not really given care. The servers were dressed really casually (sweat pants, hoodies and tshirts), but their service was great.

We ordered the Hot Pot meal that they offered for $52.95 which included a whole Crab, Lobster, Tilapia. several slices of Beef and a basket of greens.

The food took 20 minutes to be delivered to our table... The food was supposed to be cooked on our table by ourselves so I did not really understand why it took so long to do it. This was a bit ridiculous but I assumed that because they had 2 tables that were the owner's, the kitchen was occupied by their orders first.

There was only one thing that I didn't enjoy with the order. The lobster was really small, probably no more than 1lb. Other than that, everything was fine. The beef was really tasty, had a good beef taste to it. It didn't taste like the frozen products that you get at other hot pot restaurants.

Just as I finished my meal, I noticed an insect crawling along the wall and onto the table. Grossed me out but I do not expect too much from these dated restaurants. 

We finally got the bill and noticed an extra $3 charge. At first we thought that maybe they made a mistake with the initial price entered on their cash register, but when we asked them, they said it was for the soup base for the hotpot. Not once were we told that the soup base would cost extra money. And really? $3 for a bit of parsley and a century egg? That's a ridiculous price. They have told us that they will be updating the price in the future but that is not really what we were concerned about.

We paid it anyway since we had no choice but we hope that people know about this charge in the future.

Overall experience was not too bad, I didn't get to try other foods but judging from how many customers they had that service, I would assume that their food is good for their prices. They offer a lot of seafood and a variety of chinese dishes."}
{"text":"The food is very good for it's price.

You have to try the stick rice stuffed chicken. You have to call in advance because they need to prep it."}
{"text":"Fam and I come here all the time. The quail is delicious."}
{"text":"A pretty delicious place for dinner with some pretty excellent menu options.

Warning: if you don't read Chinese or have a good grasp of Chinese cuisine, you may not be able to get the most delicious things on the menu. Personally, I relied on my aunts and my brother to order everything.

Peking duck: very good. But really, I have yet to meet a peking duck I didn't enjoy. We had the meal with the wrappers and with the lettuce leaves. Very tasty.

Deep fried soft shelled crab: There had to be maybe two crabs in this order. It was HUGE and very very delicious with just the right amount of crunch and saltiness.

Deep fried oysters: Not nearly as good as the crab, these were incredibly oily and soggy, which is weird since the crab was deep fried to perfection. Not sure what happened here.

Fish and tofu... dish of some sort: Very good, the fish was excellent, but the tofu seemed a little overdone.

Service was fine, and they had the Chinese TV going, which may appeal to some. Cleanliness was on par with Chinese restaurant standards. The portions were quite huge and we ended up taking almost half of what we ordered home (we did order too much, though)

I think I would return again and bring friends!"}
{"text":"First of all this place won't win you over by its decor or ambience. The place is pretty run down and grungy looking. But the food was actually not bad. 

They started off the meal with a bowl of soup, what we had today, was Ginseng and Pork.

We ordered quite a few items on the menu:

Deep-Fried Oysters ~ Not bad, wasn't fishy nor soggy. It was quite crispy and tasty.

Deep-Fried Bitter Melon ~ This was a first for me. I never really liked eating bitter melon but this dish was ok. The bitterness wasn't that strong and the batter they use to fry it was quite unique and tasty.

Fried Pipa Tofu~ I've had this dish at other restaurants before. But their was just as good tasting.

Braised Ox Tail ~ This came in a big wok and was placed on top of a portable hot pot gas stove. It was in some kind of tomato and veggie sauce. This was also a pretty good dish.

Fu Yu Stir Fried Tung Choy ~Very Fresh and Tasty, but a bit on the salty side, but goes well with rice.

Maggi Sauce Shrimp ~ These large shrimps were first light fried then toss with Maggi Sauce. Taste was very good.

Ying Yang Rice ~ Half is a White Cream Sauce Fried Rice, other is A Tomato Base Fried Rice. This was also not a bad dish.

Black Bean Sauce Stir Fried Clams ~ This one I only had one piece of it, but from that one piece, the taste was ok as well but a bit salty, if you eat it alone without rice.

At the end of the meal they also give us tong siu (dessert), what we had tonight was, Chinese Kelp Green Bean Sweet Soup.

Also I saw the one post of this place prior going to dine at Fok Yuan, from Elaine K. stating she ordered soft shell crabs. But apparently they weren't in season, so we didn't get to order them tonight.

Overall the food was quite good, I would go back and try more stuff. 
But I minus 2 stars for the ambience itself and also the wait staff wasn't too friendly. But I think they can win you over with the food they serve."}
{"text":"Reliable late night Chinese seafood restaurant.

Usually come here after 11pm but I have also been here before for dinner.

They have specialty seafood every 2 weeks on Fridays -  you have to make RSVP. What I mean are live seafood which is not normally carried.. like exotic clams and fresh exotic fish Asian style.

Expect typical diner quality with their stir-fry.  Usually have live lobsters, eels, bass, and clams in stock.

I'm especially giving props to these two menu items:
Spicy Salted Noodle Fish
BBQ Pigeon


The spicy salted noodle fish is super tasty! Reminds me of fish French fries!!

The BBQ pigeon is also really good! It's perfectly BBQed with nice crispy skin everytime!

Beers are also super cheap here, I think $2.75 or $3 for bottle of domestic.

Great place for fresh seafood and cheap beers on a late-night snack mission!"}
{"text":"Fok Yuan Seafood Restaurant is located inside the strip plaza near the food court area. I did not even know it exist because I never see it when I drive along Midland Ave. But on a cold winter night, my friend ask why we go eat some hot pot but not the AYCE type.

The interior looks and feels dated. This place totally has this old school feel. 

As planned we ordered: Chicken ???($15.99) + Herbal Soup Base ????($4) + Fatty Beef ??($12.99)

Great for a cold day as the broth and the chicken both suppose to be immune-stimulating and restorative. All I know was I feel warm and fuzzy after I finished my meal.

Service here is fast and efficient. 

A decent place if you want some cheap eat."}
{"text":"I'm really unimpressed with this place and not just because of decor. 

Service here is the typical no frills type. Not a problem if you're used to it.
Prices are average for a Chinese restaurant. What irks me is that their portion sizes are smaller than what I would find at other restaurants (if we were to compare to the other Chinese restaurant in this plaza, that one would have bigger portions). Maybe it's the fact that they put the food on such huge plates that it makes the food seem minuscule, but it just seemed off to me. Despite the size though, most of the food was tasty. 

I wish I could give this place a three star, but honestly, there are better places around."}
{"text":"We came here for Chinese style lobster and geo-duck sashimi because of a recommendation.  So it costs $20 for a pound of lobster.  The smallest lobster was around 2.5 lbs.  For the geo-duck it was $40 per pound and the smallest was around 3.5 lbs.  Now, geo-duck is not a type of duck as i found out.  It's a kind of sea creature as my friend called it.  
Both the lobster and geo-duck sashimi were combined on a plate of ice.  We were surprised and disappointed by how little in quantity the meat were.  My favourite was livster sashimi.  It was tender and delicious with a hint of sweetness.  As for the geo-duck, the meat was a little more tough.  It tasted very fishy so i didn't care much for it.  
I would advise you to order additional dishes or else you would leave hungry."}
