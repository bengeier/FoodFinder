{"text":"Fairly good pizza with great service and environment. Not exactly worth the 5/5 rating, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Used to love this place and tell everyone about it (see my last review), but sadly no longer. It's just not as good as it used to be, so we've order less and less. Then with my last order I asked for a Greek salad with \"a lot of gyro meat\" and I got the most pathetic looking salad with almost no gyro meat that I was charged for.  When I called to let them know I was disappointed, the owner seemed to have cared less. He told me he put 4 slices of meat on it and charged me .50 a piece. Maybe if the slices were an a quarter inch each.   I don't mind paying for what I want, but a greedy owner with little regard for his customers won't be getting my business or my word of mouth.  Also, there NY style pizza has been far too thick. if you're looking for thin pizza, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Nice pizza thanks, I was able to personally customize my pizza which was a great experience for me! Down to earth manager and good side options"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I moved out of town but every time I come back to visit I make sure to order a New York style pizza from here! The family who runs the place are all really nice and the service is fast. They have a great selection and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good slice of pizza. I always want to try more things on their menu, but my regular orders are SO good that I can't bring myself to branch out and get anything else!!!"}
{"text":"Best local pizza spot by far! Owner is always on premises and food is great. True NY style pizza."}
{"text":"Love this place great New York style thin pizza, small family owned help support them very nice people"}
{"text":"Quality New York style pizza. Thin and greasy with a great sauce. This is our go-to pizza joint in the Copley area."}
{"text":"Can't beat it for the price and friendly service. Local favorite for sure!  My company eats here at least once a week seeing that we are close by. Never fails to satisfy. Can't say I've ever once had a bad experience. Every time I introduce Big Star to someone who has never tried it they say they love it! Might be my lunch today actually!"}
{"text":"We are new to the area and looking for a place to get a good meal at a good price.  We are so excited to find Big Star pizza as it is family owned and food made fresh.  The Pizza was amazing and the prices are decent.  We know we will be long time frequent customers and can't wait to try all the other menu items.  The family was very welcoming to us; we really appreciated the friendliness of the owner's son as he told us about the food, the family, and the area."}
{"text":"Awesome New York style pizza. I hope the word gets out about this little pizza shop. Fast delivery, nice service, reasonable prices and tasty food."}
{"text":"Great pizza great service on the P tonight and I have had New York tile pizza for a long time until I order from big star pizza. This is my first time ordering from them and it was nothing but pleasant I'm a chef and this is a great tasting pizza it's a little pricey but you  you get what you pay for i'll be ordering again"}
{"text":"Great food! Great prices! Huge menu and if it's not on the menu that they'll make it for you anyway! I can't say enough good things about this place. One of Copley's little hidden gems."}
{"text":"Delicious! Lunch special is a great deal, two slices and a pop for under five bucks and the pizza is great. I had the cheese and it was very basic but super tasty. No special cheese or ingredients, so I was pleasantly surprised, at the twabut I'd definitely make a repeat visit if I  was in this area. Friendly staff tops off a good experience."}
{"text":"This pizza shop is great! We always order the  cheese pizza. They go light on the sauce though so we always ask for more. It doesn't take long for them to get your prefer, and if you go in you can order pizza by the slice. The prices are inexpensive and the food taste great. The chefs there are very kind and make good food!!"}
{"text":"We just tried Big Star for the first time the other night, and were pleasantly surprised. We went with the New York style, cheese only. The dough was thin and crispy, but still retained a bit of chew to it. It was really good. The bread sticks we ordered appeared to be cut up pizza crust, so they were crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle too. Would recommend to anyone in the Copley area looking to get pizza"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service. Nice family owned restaurant with a variety of options on the menu. Food is always made fresh. Staff is very welcoming and I appreciated the son's help to inform me more about the food and area. Definitely coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"I have been ordering from Big Star for several years. I love the pizza and have had salads, spaghetti with meatballs and love their chocolate cake!  Great family too"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Copley. Classic thin New York style. They also have excellent Sicilian style. Cheap prices. Family owned. Clean. Great lunch special. Used to be known as Scotto's pizza in summit mall."}
{"text":"My husband and I usually order Gioninos, but tonight we decided to order Big Star after seeing the positive reviews and wanting to try something new...it was just ok. My husband got a NY style pizza, while I tried the Chicago style, we also got some stuffed shells, breadsticks. The NY style pizza wasn't bad, I would give it a 3/5. The Chicago style however wasn't all that great, the crust tasted stale almost, I would give that a 2/5. The stuffed shells were actually pretty good, I would order them again, you get 3 in an order. The breadsticks were pretty bland and again, tasted stale. All in all, I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in northeast Ohio. My girlfriend moved here from New York and it has fell in love with this place. They have a new York style thin crust, a Chicago style deeply dish. And one in between. Plus they have a huge menu from gyro to chicken taook. A great place with a friendly family that owns and runs it."}
{"text":"Was very excited to try Big Star Pizza, but was so disappointed. I was happy because they offer \"Chicago-style\" deep dish pizza....well maybe they've never been to Chicago. The pizza was expensive ($22 for a large pizza, before tip), skimpy on the toppings, but worst of all, the crust is the same thickness though out! I'm talking 1 inch thick crust, way way too much dough, grossly too much. After 1 piece I couldn't eat anymore due to the bread overload. Chicago-style is not thick through out the pizza, and for this price, they really should have delivered (no pun intended)."}
{"text":"My partner and I have been searching for a place that serves New York style pizza for over 2 years now. And we've finally found Big Star. They've satisfied our 2 year long pizza craving.  The crust is thin, and is nice and toasted on the bottom, and \"cracks\" when folded. Sauce and cheese ratio and flavor are there. Quality ingredients. And the prices are very fair. Large is about 16 inches for $11.50 and $2 for each additional topping.   It's definitely a hole in the wall, family owned kind of place that focuses on food rather than being flashy.  Will definitely be going back to try other things like calzones, etc."}
{"text":"I had a good experience, friendly service, clean location although I had called and ordered from work and picked up on the way back to the hotel. I found the dough was excellent, the crust was baked perfectly and not too thin nor too thick, I had ordered a  medium pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms pizza and it was really good and even better the following day.  It was a quick pleasant experience and the pizza has been one of the best in the area that I've sampled. I would recommend giving it a try,"}
{"text":"In town for the night, and was in the mood for a Calzone. After looking at several reviews of other places, I decided on Big Star... and I'm glad I did. I didn't want to patronize a national chain, I wanted a small mom 'n' pop shop, and Big Star is what you would expect. Nice couple of guys, Father and Son.... I ordered a warmed cheese slice while I was waiting for my calzone, and I found the dough to be light, yet crispy... easily foldable. The sauce was balanced - not too sweet, not too salty, not too spiced. A good amount of cheese covered...  The calzone, Ham and Cheese.... They use old school ovens here (major brownie points), no conveyor belt ovens.... so you get that \"pizza oven\" taste... he opened the door, and pulled out this golden pillow of mana... just like the pizza, the dough was soft and tender, yet crisp on the outside... brushed with butter, sprinkled with herbs, and sliced into four generous pieces... more than enough sauce was included....  I'd say this is definitely a go-to if you're passing through, they also offer subs, and Mediterranean fare (checked out their menu)... so, I'm sure whatever  you try, you'll taste the love... ;-)"}
{"text":"This place is a gem, hand-tossed new york style pizza in Copley, Ohio. They also have awesome lemonade, and the grape leaves are good too. I found one time while waiting for my daughter to take her gymnastics class, I took my son over to grab a bite to eat. We visit almost every week. Instead of giving money to Donato's or Dominos, we would prefer to support a small local family business."}
{"text":"We always try to grab a New York style pizza whenever we are in a different town and this pizza was great!! Definitely worth grabbing a pie!"}
