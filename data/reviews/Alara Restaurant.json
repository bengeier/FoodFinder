{"text":"Disclaimer: I didn't actually try the food here. But for good reason!

About 2 weeks after a trip to Turkey, I was craving a pide and some Turkish meatballs. After reading a few mixed reviews, I grabbed a member of the parental unit saying they HAD to try some (potentially) good Turkish food. As it turns out, Alara is about a 3-minute drive from my house - the location used to be a Golden Griddle and I was completely unaware of the switch.

First of all, it was extremely hard to find the entrance. The huge sign facing Sheppard at the front of the building is very misleading - there was no door to be found. The entrance is actually at the back of the building right beside a window full of plastic replica Japanese meals - how confusing! We got there around 8:30pm - prime dinnertime for people from that part of the world. However, the place was completely deserted except for a happy family of 4 in one corner. There was a musician playing some music on a stage half-heartedly. All in all, this was not the setting I had pictured for my Turkish feast. The waiters and kitchen staff seemed very friendly but I grabbed a take-out menu and fled.

We sat in the car perusing the menu for a while - $14 for a pide?! That just seems ridiculous. I would give this joint 1 star but since I didn't actually eat anything, 2 seems fair.

And so my hunt for good Turkish food continues .. somehow, I don't think Alara is where it's at."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill quickly.  Prices used to be about 20% lower and food quality and quantity was 20% higher.  I used to get a Turkish Pide there about 1.5years ago for under $10 and I would always have plenty of leftovers.  I just got one for lunch and I'm still hungry.  Unfortunately, it seems ecomonomics has caught up with this place."}
{"text":"I JUST discovered this restaurant with my family who have high expectations of Turkish food in general. This spot just blew our mind. 

We have tried the following items as main course which I HIGHLY recommend:
- Kiymali Pide (If you don't like your food spicy, ask for the non-spicy meat for this one. Otherwise the meat is spicy, but delicious for those who like a little spice)
- Peynirli Pide (They use a delicious authentic Turkish mozzarella cheese for this one) 
- Karisik Pide (A little bit of everything)
- Kapali Pide (Similiar to Kiymali Pide, but the top of the pide is closed as well and a bit less spicy)
- Iskender Kebap (Although Alara specializes in pides, this authentic Turkish dish is DELICIOUS!)

Although I have reviewed Turkish Grill as well, I would definitely choose Alara over Turkish Grill. Don't get me wrong, Turkish Grill is delicious as well but Alara just actually blew my mind :P"}
{"text":"Alara  is CLOSED indefinitely. Rumor has it that the Sashimi House will move into that location. So, I have gone from 4 Stars in November 2009 to 1 Star in March 2012."}
