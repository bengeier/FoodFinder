{"text":"Only Authentic Indian food in Montreal. During my stay in Montreal, I visited many Indian restaurants but 'Peg N Tikka' stood out to be 'The Best'.   Food: DELICIOUS. Their's Fish Tikka is my favourite. Must try.  Service: Service is super fast. Owner of the restaurant is very friendly and takes good care of customers' preferences.  If you like Indian cuisine and you are in Montreal, I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and amazing food. We tried four different dishes and everything was delicious. Worth every penny. Good to know is that they are still waiting for alcohol permission, but they will get it in a month."}
{"text":"New bar and restaurant in town . It's the sister restaurant of \"Namaste Montreal \" . There skewers are the best. Try the chicken tikka skewer for the starters. Vegetarians had a lot of options to choose from the menu . Try the paneer tikka , it's the cottage cheese grilled on a low flame with Indian spices and served with mint sauce. Tofu addicts had the option to choose a lot too. It's a big place that can seat 55 people. It's Ideal for families and to party with friends . It's a stone throw away from saint Laurent metro station , so it can be easily accessible to everyone ."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to coming here for so long. Great place with sufficient seating. Restaurant owned by the same guys who run Namaste Montreal in McGill Ghetto. The owner gave us a warm welcome and served us himself. He recognized me from Yelp reviews and we had a fun chat. They are soon getting alcohol permit and will be serving beer. Most dishes are $11-$12. There are a few fusion dishes that I feel were experimented to serve dietary needs preferences such as veganism (there's tofu curry people!). I took chicken karara which was so good: sweet AND spicy! Great thing about this place, they will adjust to your spice level accordingly so my food was perfect for my tastebuds. Having only one type of curry might get monotonous so I will recommend them offering Thalis maybe? Or maybe have a good side of salad to go with the curry? Either way, I'd totally recommend this place for a chill Indian night.   They also have authentic Mithai (sweets) and chai! We closed our meal with a Mithai and cup of hot chai. The Mithai was complimentary with yelp check in. Will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Hipster kids are taking over everywhere ... from Mumbai à Montréal ! I'm pretty sure a couple of monied Indian expat Millennials who study Chemistry at McGill tripped balls on some new laboratory/designer party drug one fateful brunch, saw the Universe as it is, and decided to open up a restobar smack dab on the corner of boul. St-Lau and rue Sherbs.  These folks are go-getters. They make a pretty mean chana samosa. I also had their shahi paneer thali which was also legit.   When you're hungry after hangin' at the bar or club and you're on your way home ... stop in late at night and have a hearty snack to soak up all of those libations and night caps. You won't regret it.   Nothing tops the evening like a nice piquant midnight snack at 3 o'clock in the morning.   Ask the kindly proprietor to tell you about the thesis of her doctorate in Chemistry from McGill University! It's pretty much like Breaking Bad, Big Bang Theory and every single Bollywood film combined up inside of this piece."}
{"text":"Nous avons essayé le poulet au beurre. Très bon. Un peu épicé pour ceux qui ne mange pas épicé, Mais c'est de la nourriture indienne, C'est normal.  Petite cuisine alors chaque table est cuisiné une à la fois, ce qui rend le service long.  La musique est très forte par contre, Et à part que sa semble parler indien, C'est décidé par le staff jouée d'un iPad connecter par Bluetooth. Donc ça changeait souvent en plein milieu, grichait..."}
