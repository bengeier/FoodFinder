{"text":"Great variety of tasty salads and paninis. Prices reasonable and staff very friendly. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My real desire was to leave Christine a tip due to her great service. In lieu, I've decided to leave a great review. The food was awesome- I had the Siam and Ty Cobb. More importantly Christine rocks! A+ for service!"}
{"text":"This review is not about the food because I like that. However today when me and 2 of my work friends ate here there was a big mistake. I ordered and got my salad, my first friend ordered and got his sandwich, but my second friend never got his order. We sat there eating because we all have to get back to work in an hour, and my friend had NO food. I finally had to get up and tell someone that they had forgotten to give my friend his order. The girl made the sandwich (so the order was completely not made at all) for my friend, but by that time we had to take it to go, and he had to eat at his desk. Also when he gets a sandwich he usually gets a little side salad and that was not provided in the bag. The girl who made the sandwich apologized, but that does nothing when my friend left mad greens hungry with his lunch hour wasted."}
{"text":"If you like food born illness this is your place.
I had a Siam I am here today and got some pretty painful food poisoning."}
{"text":"First.  they have MAINE ROOT NATURAL SODA.  AWESOME.  The  hummus is a great way to eat light and then feel full.  The Jalape√±o Hummus is Great.  The beet hummus, I thought would be GROSS, but it grows on you and it is actually a favorite of mine.  Staff is very kick back .  Good place."}
{"text":"Don't go here at lunch on weekdays if you can help it. They take the longest time to serve and mess up your order. Happened to me 2 times and now I learned my lesson! I have seen other customers standing in line simply to ask what happened to their order.

Otherwise good food, friendly staff. Just not happy with the speed of service."}
{"text":"Fantastic salads and sandwiches! First time in, ordered the Siam I am and the mad Cuban; both wonderful! Great customer service too!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical but my wife convinced me to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised.  Generous portions, great mix of flavors, good service.  Only downside is the extra charge for tomatoes.  They claim heirloom tomatoes are premium ingredient. Still, very good food. We will add to our rotation."}
{"text":"I am not a salad guy, but I am trying to better.  I got the Athena with pita and hummus.  It was wonderful and satisfied me without making me sluggish.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm calling a salad joint of all places not very vegan-friendly. Only one salad and grain bowl option are vegan as-ordered and no soup or wrap option is. Of course you can always make substitutions and get a different add-on for salads, bowls, or wraps but you get charged for the meal as if it still has the (more expensive) animal products in it. And again, there's no way to have a vegan soup here and a large proportion of the dressings aren't vegan. Thankfully, you can get oil and a few vinegar options as a vegan dressing instead.

If their food didn't taste good this review would be a 3 star for options and service. Overall very fresh and tasty ingredients. First time I went in, I was the only person yet it took a really long time to make one salad and a side of pita. I got a Siam I Am with some substitutions but I was not told at this visit that I could get other toppings in place of the ones I didn't want. Tasted good, but did not have enough dressing with the \"medium dressed\" option.

Second visit tonight, I asked a female employee why the red wine vinaigrette was not vegan when on their website it claimed to be only made with oil, vinegar, and salt. She politely answered my questions and told me that I could get two other add-ons for the chicken and feta I didn't want on my Athena salad as well as a simple red wine vinegar and oil salad dressing. Another male employee told me that there is mustard and honey among other things in the red wine vinaigrette and was rude when I pointed out that the information on the website is confusing and not accurate. The salad and pita I got were both very good and I'm glad that at least one employee tonight was very helpful."}
{"text":"Definitely good. Like Chipotle for salads and sandwiches but without the ecoli.  I like how you can customize everything so it can be as healthy as you'd like. They list calories, protein, etc on the menu too, which is helpful in deciding what to eat. 

Check your mail too. They sometimes send out coupons for buy one get one free meals."}
{"text":"Quick and easy way to get a decent salad. I like the ability to pick exactly what I want. Service is always fast and friendly. There are definitely better salad places around but none that you can run in and out of quickly enough."}
{"text":"I live in this neighborhood and frequent this spot often. I have yet to have an above average experience. The over the phone ordering never is quicker than the line. If you order a juice where you order a salad, make sure someone is making it. I have had multiple times where I've ordered a juice and no one was there to take the order so I subsequently waited 20 minutes because I was too kind to butt in. When I finally did, an employee looked at me and said \"do you need that now?\" 
I'm pretty sure the staff has changed frequently, generally they're nice!"}
{"text":"Got to love a nice filling salad perfect for your vegan or vegetarian friends, a great place to build your own salads or pick a special one and add to 
Choose a base and build from there plenty of fresh toppings 
Salads come in 2 sizes small and large both are very filling
Or choose a pre made great pressed juices"}
{"text":"This place got my order to me immediately, Wow! I ordered the da Vinchi with no onions and she suggested I use roasted broccoli instead. It was perfect and a huge portion. I also love that the calories are on the bottom of each salad :) great place."}
{"text":"Super good salads and wraps for good prices. Easy to track if your into nutrition and tracking your macros. Overall great place to get a quick healthy meal."}
{"text":"I went in to try MAD Greens tonight and I am so glad I did! The friendliest staff and delicious food! I got a Bollywood wrap (curried chicken salad wrap) and a Green Detox juice. Both were delicious. My only complaint is that they put cayenne in my drink even though I asked them not to. Will be back here for sure though!"}
{"text":"Not a very organized system I must start off saying. 

Mad Greens made me Mad!!   
It's a salad bar where the staff makes the salad for you. There was some pretty tasty options so I had gotten the Crazy Ivan salad and my two children ordered 2 create your own salads.

So they started off creating my daughters salad, I then paid for the whole 3 orders after they completed only one salad. The one employee who made it said for me to just go back to the beginning to finish the rest of the salads. By then a few customers had came in and my order got pushed behind theirs. I had to keep reminding them what I ordered. I was getting skipped around although I was there before everyone else and had paid before everyone else. This would of been unnecessary if they would of had a better organized system. The guy that finished my order was a completely different guy that started it. He had asked the other employees what happened to the ticket and all the other guy could say is I got busy. While the girl in front stood there waiting to get off work. Talk about annoying. Other than my bad customer service. The salads weren't that bad. I like the idea of serving up fresh salads and healthy juices. I just wish they'd figure out how to deal with 3 orders next time."}
{"text":"I literally came in here 3 days in a row for lunch as I had training right down the street. Super glad I found this place as I was looking for something quick and healthy and this place more than fit the bill. I quickly went from ordering a menu salad on the first day to making my own the next 2 days, always adding in additional proteins. Service was quick and friendly and the portion was on point for the money paid (I averaged $14-16 per salad). I loved all the diff toppings and protein options and sauces. Honestly I wish there were more of these places around, but it's probably easier on the wallet they aren't."}
{"text":"Send me a coupon and I will come. This was a BOGO and I tried the salad with the blue cheese dressing. It is a bit pricey at $10 for a small though. The chicken, bacon pannini was decent I heard and the spicy hummus received more good tidings. With the coupon it is worthy, but otherwise maybe a few times a year. The limit for salad ingredients seems to be four before you start jacking up the price too much."}
{"text":"Hubby liked his sandwich
My salad had smoked salmon
Nobody told me my salmon Caesar Salad was going to smoked
Taste kept getting stronger
I specifically said I didn't want anything hot or spicy
Not happy with the service or suggestions
Salad was just okay
Prices good
Not overly impressed"}
{"text":"Great for a healthy lunch. I always get their create your own wrap. Gets a little busy during lunch so if you're in a rush call in your order!"}
{"text":"A pretty good spot to grab a quick, healthy meal. I always choose the Siam I am salad. The food is fresh and locally grown. 4/5 stars. They are a little stingy with the chicken in the Siam I am"}
{"text":"I love to see healthy franchises popping up left and right.  I accidentally stumbled upon Mad Greens when I was going to get a juice at nearby Nektar.  It had just opened, so I gave it a try.  I was really impressed.

If it's your first time, I recommend going with one of the menu salads.  If you try to build your own, there are soooo many options it can be overwhelming.  And I can only imagine how annoying that is for the workers (\"can I have some of those beans?  No wait do I want beans?  Let's do quinoa.  No, actually make that chicken\")

If you want to eat healthy and actually get full, this is the place for you.  Pro tip:  order ahead online and skip the line (even though there hasn't been one when I've went).  It also helps reduce that \"what should I order?\" anxiety."}
{"text":"My first time here and I would say the experience was good.  The salad portion was fair and it was very tasty. I had the Ty Cobb with some of the Mad spices and spicy avocado. This is a great lunch spot for a quick salad or panini and I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Love their salads but they most def down-sized their salad bowls if you get it to-go. I mean c'mon, with all the healthy\"ish\" places popping up I'm a little disappointed  that they think they can charge $10 for 1/2 salad. I feel I need to try their larger salad to-go and see if there's a big enough difference."}
{"text":"I really REALLY enjoy MAD Greens. I've been to 3 locations now and this one is my favorite (mostly because it is super close to my house and I don't have to deal with terrible parking at the 7th Ave & McDowell location).

I like the bigger store and the friendly staff. I brought my sister for the first time this past Monday, along with my twin toddlers. SO much yummy happened. The boys loved the potato soup - they were dunking the pita bread in it and making yummy sounds so I will assume that is love :-) And my sister was amazed to find out that the salad she created was so healthy (she looked it up on an online calculator).

I love how fresh everything is, how clean everything is, and the variety.  I prefer the setup at this location above the 7th Ave location. Here you can see all the ingredients. There, they are and you are not able to see everything.

Plus the parking at Hilton Village is so easy."}
{"text":"I eat here every time I come to Scottsdale. Healthy fresh food and excellent service. They have unique salad menu and a huge variety of dressings. Love this place."}
{"text":"Still can't get over the quality of vegetables at MAD greens here in the Valley.  If you're wanting a light lunch or dinner, which I tend to do before a race as I did on Saturday.  Easy to pack high protein, low carb, and medium fat meal.

I've never seen a guy work here and the girls at this location were very nice people."}
{"text":"Great food,fast service!  Love it! They have great salad options.  All calories are listed too."}
{"text":"I love the range of ingredients you get to pick from here. Everything seems fresh and flavorful and made with love- not your standard preservative filled restaurant meal. The ingredients here are real. The proteins could be better- chicken has been dry on every visit but I'm still impressed overall"}
{"text":"I usually have no trouble with ordering but today I decided to order online beforehand. There were 6 salads on my order. A salad takes about 30 seconds to make in this place, and it was empty of customers when I showed up. After waiting about 10-15 minutes I asked what was taking so long. I was told my \"promised time\" online wasn't for another 5 minutes. THE PLACE IS EMPTY and there are 4 people working here. Where is the customer service? 

I'm not ordering beforehand anymore. I'll just come in, order my group order and hold up the line. At least I'll get immediate service."}
{"text":"Finding a local salad joint with dairy free options is next to impossible, especially one that is as delicious as MAD Greens.  I absolutely love the Crazy Ivan with added shrimp and the miso vinaigrette is vegan! The hummus trio is also a must try.  The garlic is my favorite and is pretty spicy.  Plus their fresh squeezed juices are to die for.  If you're looking for something light and delicious for these hot, almost summer days, try this place out.  It is definitely worth multiple trips!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I feel right at home because this is the kind of food that I make at home! Mike the manager was awesome and so was Ally.  My new favorite lunch spot."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite salad bar as of late. They have really fresh ingredients and quite a large variety as well. Everything is customizable and the staff is very helpful in making sure you get the exact kind of salad/bowl/wrap that you want. The only minor inconvenience is that they run out of some key ingredients sometimes but other than that I love this place and will continue to go!"}
{"text":"There's just so many toppings for me to choose and the dressing is just so delicious. What really gets me is the Maine Root soda. Absolutely better than Coke or Pepsi products. 

I usually like to get the large salad, and to me, the Cobb and Don Quixote are one of the better ones. Although the Crazy Ivan also is up there. The place is pretty modern and clean. You just walk up and they make the salad right in front of you. I highly suggest ordering some of the olives because they bring out some intense flavors of other toppings and the salad.

Usually not a fan of $10+ salads but I might make an exception. Also, I suggest not doing take out because those bowls are smaller than the eat-in bowls mainly because they have to close the take out bowls with a lid. With the normal bowls, the salad can be piled on into a mountain shape. That means more salad!"}
{"text":"First time visit, had the Pamona salad. It was amazingly delicious.The sweetness of the apples, craisins and praline pecans really made this salad stand out. I ordered the combo with sun dried tomato hummus and pita bread... also very delicious.  Service was fast (although I was there late in the evening) and staff was super friendly. If you're looking for a new salad place, I'd highly recommend Mad Greens!"}
{"text":"I've been to a couple Mad Greens locations and they are all good.  The employees are always friendly and the salads are consistently well made.  This last visit I had the Edgar Allan Poe which has steak, apples and bleu cheese among the ingredients.  It was very tasty and the portion was large enough that I was able to take some home."}
{"text":"I love this place. I am dairy free and they have the best dairy free soups!! Salads are always fresh. Staff is super friendly!! So happy they are in Hilton Village!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  I need my protein and they have plenty of it, on demand ordering.  Great fast-casual right down the road from my home.  Good location, great service."}
{"text":"Needed to kill time before a hair appointment and I was hungry so I stopped in Mad Greens tonight. It's a chipotle style salad bar where you can design your own salad or choose one from off the menu. I went with the Ty Cobb. I was really impressed with the service when my salad was being made. They were very thorough and made sure I was ok with the amount of each item that went in. They even asked if I wanted to swap any items out for something else. As a picky eater I really appreciated that. My final thoughts on the salad were...meh I could make the same thing at home. Average. If I'm going out I want to feel like it's going to be worth it. That being said I still think ill go back to try their paninis and soup. 

Oh and it was so cold inside!! Do yourself a favor and outside while you still can!"}
{"text":"Just a meh here.  Came here the other day looking for a healthy and quick meal.  When it comes down to it, it's just a salad.  I can make it at home.  The quality of meat they use isn't really great and tastes like it was precooked way in advance.

You might as well just go to the salad bar at AJ's or get a pre-made salad at Trader Joe's.  Or just drive the extra mile to ChopShop in Old Town.  All of the servers were really nice, but this is a pass for me."}
{"text":"I'm thrilled to have this MAD Greens location super close to where I work and live... 
This is my go-to spot for a healthy and delicious salad when the mood strikes or the body craves...

My top three recommendations, and the salads I typically order are:
*Siam I Am
*Dionysos
*Ty Cobb

I sometimes switch up the protein options and go with shrimp instead of chicken, and if you like spice, I highly recommend adding the spicy avocado to anything you order!

This place gets super busy mid-week at lunchtime, so avoid the 12-1 hour if you can... even so, the line moves fast and I love this fast casual, order at the counter concept.  There is indoor and outdoor seating and super friendly employees.  

Food is fresh and moderately priced considering the quality of the ingredients.  They have a handful of kids mini meal options on the menu too, which are perfect for my toddlers.  I hope to try their catering soon as well!

If you're looking for a healthy salad or sandwich in a super casual environment, look no further than MAD Greens.  Whether it's this location or one of the others in the Valley (or in Colorado, Texas or Utah), you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"So this was my first time at a mad greens and the closest thing I can equate it to is a chipotle for salad bowls.  You go down the line picking what greens, grains, veggies, meats and dressing you want.  I ended up with a pre-constructed salad since I was overwhelmed.  I ended up with a steak and pear salad with a vinaigrette dressing.  It was...ok.  I wasn't blown away, and it wasn't as fresh as I would have liked.  Plus at $10 bucks a salad give or take, I expected a lot more.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I can walk to this place and pick up fresh, and I do mean fresh, made to order salads to enjoy on my patio at home.  And the price is right. I make a weekly pilgrimage when we are in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"I love this place for quick and healthy food.  And I love the  Mad Spice.  I had a party of 14 for lunch this week and it was quick and the service was flawless.  You can travel the world's cuisine here!"}
{"text":"Love this place went feeling like delicious salad. You can have a salad with a lot of great ingredients without having to buy it all at the store and make it at home. Their Maine root soda is tasty as well. Service is always friendly and accommodating"}
{"text":"love this place!! Great selection clean kitchen whole food with kind service add to that affordable & wha else could you ask for???"}
{"text":"Yuck! Cute place, friendly staff, great idea, bad tasting food. My cobb salad was filled with gristly dark chicken pieces with skin on, some of the lettuce was brown, the bacon was tough, and there was barely any avocado. Ick. When the manager came to ask about our meal, which was very kind, I told her I was disappointed by the dark meat in my salad. There was no mention of dark meat on the ingredients list on the overhead menu. She apologized and said that's how the Cobb comes and I should order the buffalo chicken next time! Sadly, there won't be a next time...very disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! The juices are great! I love eating here plus the prices are very reasonable! I had a great experience and the staff seem to be very knowledgeable and friendly. The cashier i have encountered various times is a very helpful gentleman"}
{"text":"Great salad, reasonable prices, good location. The wait was too long because they need another person (a 4th) to help them during lunch hour. Not a viable spot uf you are in a rush, but otherwise good."}
{"text":"Om nom nom. I haven't been to this location since the Elite event so it was nice to try it on a regular day. I came to grab dinner before going home and the place was chill; a few people inside and outside enjoying their meal.

I tend to be a creature of habit and expressed that to the young woman working and she suggested I try the seasonal Pancho Villa instead of my usual Don Quixote. I got shrimp instead of the chicken and the salad comes with baby greens, corn, quinoa, mad spice pumpkin seeds, and a cilantro chili lime dressing. The combo worked and it was delicious! I got extra Mad spice added and bought a bottle since the one at home is almost out. Their spice is good stuff, worth bringing it home and using on all types of dishes. 

Glad I made it back to Mad Greens, and hope it won't be too long before I come again."}
{"text":"Had a great dining in experience. Great food, loved the Siam I Am with tofu. MAD had super service (shout out to Emerald) and very pleasant for dining in. Unlike places with big carry out trade, the bathroom was very clean. Ditto for the seating area inside."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today with our family! We loved it! The customer service is stellar! I think we found our new spot! I made my own salad and it was unbelievable. We will be back"}
{"text":"Delicious healthy food options and ample outdoor seating if you want to bring your pup after a visit to Chapparal Dog Park. Cant go wrong with any of the menu items, but the Buddha bowl and fresh juices are stellar and 100% worth trying!!"}
{"text":"Did a quick search on yelp for places near by where we could get a salad, and we came across this gem. The ordering process was extremely easy and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"This is such a great place to eat healthy and walk away feeling satisfied!  Since discovering this place my family and I have eaten here half a dozen times it's a high end salad restaurant made to order.  They have quinoa as a topping which I love and are reasonably priced.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great healthy salads, wraps and sandwiches! We stopped here after a hike and it was the best spot to fuel on good food! So many choices for gourmet salads. We need more places like this one!"}
{"text":"What a great place for healthy eating! Interesting & delicious salads (we had the Crazy Ivan & Pancho Villa) served Chipotle-style. Portions were plentiful & staff was pleasant. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Where have you been all of my life??? I Healthy, tasty food at good prices that lists calories, protein AND friendly, fast service???  I'm so excited to have discovered this gem!!!!  I eat salads daily, and love knowing nutritional info so this will become my \"go to\" place.  Very cool that they have choices (even a dozen plus dressing options) or you can build your own. I can't wait to try all of these. Such great combos and options.  Lots of seating and clean.  Can sit in the beautiful front courtyard or plenty of space inside. 

Thank you for joining Scottsdale Chamber so I could learn about you.  You are somewhat hidden so I would have missed out.  :( 

P.s Only thing I would change is to add wifi and a frequent eater card or something like that."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this location since it first opened.  Unfortunately the standards seem to be slipping.  The romaine lettuce today was mostly white and not appetizing at all.   This is disappointing especially given the pricing."}
{"text":"So excited Mad Greens has come to the neighborhood. Have been to other locations, but they weren't super convenient as they were far from where I work and live. This new location is close to both and I couldn't be happier. The food is fresh and delicious, made to order and quick! If you like it spicy, try the mad spices. Yum! Perfect place for a quick healthy meal. Will be a regular here for sure."}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times and finally have had it.  I had the ceasar/chicken salad and as usual the chicken was tough as nails....horrible....will not go back"}
{"text":"I love the variety of made to order Salads. There is every nut, grain, veggie that your little healthy heart desires. The dressings are unique and you can stay on the light side or splurge a bit. Love to get a big salad where I can munch for days and not feel guilty."}
{"text":"The low rating is due to the estimated markup this business charges customers for some leaves.  

We got a two for one coupon and tried it this week.  The establishment is clean, hip, and the customer service was quick and efficient.  However the end result is a bowl of greens with a small amount of other added veg for $11.  I would guess the markup is 5x to 6x  of what I could make at the supermarket with added veg.  So bottom line, $11 for a bowl of leaves.  The menu is tough too, as it's hard to distinguish from one item to another, basically little differentiation.  The dressings had a strange gooey texture, which makes me think they are not healthy - real dressing doesn't look like that.  I would pay max $6 for the convenience of a salad to go, definitely not more than $10.  Approaching $12+....nope."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting MAD Greens. A coworker has been bragging for a while about this place, she finally got me to visit. 

I ordered the Siam I am and it was great. Quinoa was cooked well, I asked that they use all kale for the lettuce and they were more than happy to oblige. The portions were generous and their spicy seasoning was a great balance of salt + spice.

I'll definitely be back here for a meal sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Well, the MAD Greens addiction is in full swing as this is my second day in a row eating it. I stopped into this location to order a big Doc Holiday salad. This location seemed a little bit off kilter, however. I have had the pleasure of trying out 3 of the 4 locations and usually don't have any sort of issue...not that I had an issue this time. It's just the the avocado added to the salad didn't look so hot and I ordered a big salad and she put it in the regular sized bowl so it was squished and hanging out the sides. Also, since I got it to go, it would have been nice to have a bag so I didn't have to carry the salad, fork, straw, napkins, and jar or MAD spice I bought. Anyway, it's a newer location so there are probably some kinks to iron out. These are just minor things but I felt they were worth mentioning so they could be corrected."}
{"text":"The staff at this Mad Greens is nice. Sometimes, they do get your order requests a little mixed up if you deviate from the way they typically make a menu item so you need to be sure you are paying attention or at least that they are paying attention when you make your special order. 

I was super sick on Thursday and my husband took my son to school which is a block or two from this Mad Greens. I didn't feel like eating meat so I requested he bring me home a Mark Twain made with tofu instead of the citrus chicken with which it normally comes. You can imagine my disappointment when he arrived home, and I discovered they had made it with chicken. :-(

That aside, USUALLY, when they make it correctly, I love their food. Greens are fresh and excellent. This place has been a huge go-to for me since I have converted to a mainly plant-based diet. 

Healthy, fresh, delicious."}
{"text":"Lots of options, tasty but a bit pricey, ability to manage calories, nutrients and flavor

I have frankly never been to a place like this, but to enjoy and benefit from it most, I found it very useful to visit their website before going there. I otherwise would have felt overwhelmed by choice when I walked in. They offer a variety of salads, paninis, wraps, juices, soups and other items in an essentially healthy vein as opposed to other fast foods. Their web site allowed me to completely understand all nutritional and caloric elements of what I might order. It also allowed me to clearly understand that salad and health don't automatically add up, although they offer lots of healthy options.

I've been there four times in the past week, once for a freshly made juice (green detox), once to have a dine in salad (the Ty Cobb) and soup (Jalapeno & Tomatillo Gazpacho). and twice to pick up custom salads to consume at home. 

First of all, they have very creative standard and seasonal offerings that run the gamut of flavor combinations and include vegan, organic, gluten free and dairy free options. The calorie and nutrient range is broad, and you can order their regular offerings, or create your own to specification.

I loved my initial Ty Cobb salad, but didn't realize that the calories identified on their menu don't appear to include the dressing, since they make a recommendation, but it is a matter of choice. The salad was excellent. They offer salads in regular and big sizes. I found the regular to be a generous meal for me. 

To their credit, they allow tastes of items to aid your choice from a flavor perspective. They also allow you to swap certain elements of their standard menu offerings.

I love the element of choice here, and I love their nutrition calculator on the website that fills you in on everything from cholesterol and sodium to fat, protein and other key nutrient elements as you add or remove components of a dish. It's like my pre-dining entertainment. I also like that I can order my selection on line (standard, or as I custom as I could imagine) for pick up with no wait in line in about 15 minutes. 

This location just opened this month, and the staff is still learning the ropes to some degree, but they are friendly, helpful and attentive. The focus of mad greens is their commitment to high quality, organic and local ingredients. They are also committed to fair trade

Their Cannellini Beans have become a staple in my salads here, and I love the spicy avocado (avocado and their mad spice). I am hooked on the slow-roasted chicken and the fat free balsamic vinaigrette. Even so, I haven't had the same salad twice.

I think it will be a long time before I get tired of dining here. You should note, it is not inexpensive, but I think the prices are fair for the quality and quantity."}
{"text":"My first visit, I had the Ty Cobb, the ingredients were very fresh, of a high quality and most of all very tasty.
The veggie soup was also very good. The herb tea and green  were too sweet for me but the black tea was good."}
{"text":"First time trying out Mad Greens - I had a few coworkers mention it, and decided to try it out on my lunch break. The staff was friendly and quick to greet me, and were more than happy to help me pick out the salad that would most suit my tastes. I decided on the Doc Holliday salad and a cup of tortilla soup. Both were delicious, and the signature black tea was just what I needed as a little pick me up. My only complaint is that none of the tables were wiped down, and a few tables had leftover napkins and papers people had left on the table, so I had to wipe my own table down - not the most appetizing way to start your lunch. Other than that, I enjoyed it quite a bit, and will visit again."}
