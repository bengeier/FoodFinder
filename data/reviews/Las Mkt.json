{"text":"It's airport food . Actually not bad airport. Just not a 4 star place. Sandwich had decent flavor. Baguette roll could have been better being toasted. A bit pricey and being anything more than a few sides you had to pay extra. My food was fresh and moist.my kid had the turkey sandwich on the same roll and felt about the same. We felt the food being made to order and you had the selection to personalize the selection helps this place. It did not feel fast food. A few tweaks and I felt they could earn that higher star rating. Past reviews had horrible pictures so I took a few to help out."}
{"text":"Service as awful! Girl I ordered from was not helpful at all and seemed to have an attitude.  Zero leadership from the workers, as everyone (customers) were confused about where to order and pick up!  Sandwich was overpriced and didnt taste very good, especially after dealing with such lazy, unpleasant workers!"}
{"text":"2.5 rounding up to 3. It's airport food. (I'm feeling nicer today, I guess.)  Kale Chicken Caesar salad - I forgot how scary chicken can be when it's not so fresh / probably not veggie fed or cage free, etc.   It's basic sustenance & I needed it so I paid $11+ for this sad, sad, salad.   Maybe go for the hot food instead."}
{"text":"TURN AROUND AND GO TO JERSEY MIKES NOW!!!!These place is horrible. The people that work their have no clue what they are doing. We ordered (and paid) for two sandwiches. First the rude sandwich maker said we only ordered one. Showed her the receipt that shows 2. She made the other sandwich then THREW it at my husband. Then I get my sandwich and it's missing turkey. It's a turkey and cheese sandwich! She said, that's not what you ordered. First, she didn't  take my order. Then she handed me a stack of turkey on a piece of paper. They say that the meat is fresh carved, I call bull."}
{"text":"Just skip it. Burger king next door will deliver a meal of similar quality, but at least your expectations will already be at fast food level. I had a CBLT sandwich. The chicken was nearly frozen, they didn't bother toasting the bread or even cutting the sandwich in half."}
{"text":"I honestly left wishing I had stopped at Burger King right next door; at least at Burger King I know what I am and what I am not getting.  The place looked promising, which probably added to my disappointment. My expectations at anything in an Airport are pretty low, but I didn't even end up finish my food.  I got a steak sandwich, the steak was dry, the veggies were not crisp and the bread was dried out. It still got three stars as I don't know anything better in Mccarran airport."}
{"text":"Any place with an establishment in an airport would never survive outside in the real world where people can actually choose not to pay hundreds of dollars for crap, because there's more than crap from which to choose. This place is no exception, which is no surprise to anyone. The reason I write a bad review is related to service. There was one other person in line ahead of me. I ordered a cold sandwich. And waited. And waited. A guy later came up and ordered the same sandwich, but with an ingredient I excluded. He got his well before I did. I figured it was because I'm female. But even when I went to the restroom in the meantime, while still waiting, the sandwich they gave me included the ingredient. I really wanted to just give that ingredient back to them. But, alas, it's in an airport for a reason..."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst service I've had in 10 years.  It really seems like they were moving in slow mothion.  Food was so so but if you're in a hurry like most people at the airport then do not go here."}
{"text":"Horrible service and food. The guy at counter took at least 5 minutes entering a simple order, but it turns out he writes a few small words on a piece of paper for the incompetent food assembly person to process.   The bacon tasted like stale cardboard and the sandwich wasn't even close to what I asked for.   Avoid this place at all costs. There's a Jersey Mikes not too far way. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"First, shame on me for not checking Yelp first. However, I will try to be as objective as possible: 1. I understand overpriced airport food all too well. I've been in a traveling job for over ten years... 2. Service was extremely slow and I only had one lady in front of me. I was never acknowledged until it was my turn. Not spoken to or anything. Mentality of lady serving me was One. Sandwich. At. A. Time. 3. I ordered the ham and cheese sandwich. It was basic; she asked if I wanted everything on it and I excluded mustard. I asked for lettuce and tomato, she didn't have lettuce but could put tomato on there for $0.50 extra! Did I get credit for the mustard off the $10 sandwich...no!  Keep moving--my advice!"}
{"text":"Horrible attitude by the few staff members.  Long lines while the staff bickers.   Ordered Southwest turkey salad and the staff member gets in an uproar when I asked if smoked turkey was placed in the salad.    Never again."}
{"text":"Yay my new go to for when I have a layover at he airport.  At the c boarding area.  Got the southwest salad and was able to substitute the cheese for kale and fried onion for fresh red onion.  Super fast and better than the fresh fare that's grab n go here.  The sweet lady was accommodating and quick.  And she assembled the salad for me right there and then so it hasn't been sitting in a heat lamp for hours.  Will definitely come back.  And score also for not having to stand in the long line for Starbucks either!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here eating and the first time I have much better memories of what the sandwich was.  I really enjoyed the pickled onions and the cranberry a aoli sauce but my big complaint is with the bread.   The bridge itself is good I like Rye my problem is with it being not toasted.   They warm it up in an oven and I kid you not it was like a brick.   It hurt my teeth in the roof of my mouth even biting into this thing.   If I was paying five or six bucks I probably just shut my mouth but for chips and a drink and a sandwich it was $17 and change so I expect better quality.   I like my bread toasted so get a toaster oven not it's a commercial huge oven to toast bread. It took an additional 10 minutes to toast bread. Wtf?  I'm not coming back I'll stick with pizza or Mexican food if I want to get real fancy.   Lol.   Airport food blows donkey nuts"}
{"text":"I wish I'd checked Yelp before eating here. I had The Gobbler sandwich. The bread needed more toasting for sure and of course airport mediocre ingredients. My husband got a flat bread and it was so gross. He threw it out and got Jersey Mikes"}
{"text":"They had some good options for an airport restaurant, but not amazing food. I ordered the classic flatbread and it tasted like frozen ingredients in pita bread. Also, they charged me for the wrong item and I ended up paying more than I was supposed to. When I asked about it, they didn't offer to fix it right away and said if needed they could call their manager, but wasn't very apologetic about their mistake. Even though I'm limited in the airport, I still won't be coming back to this option."}
{"text":"Wow. The review gods are not happy with this place. Reading the angry reviews about the overpriced food in an airport is quite hilarious, was airport food ever really priced fair?  This venue offers plenty of space to sit down and get some extra work done on your laptop before take off. Plus they have a decent menu for a fast casual airport restaurant eatery. I went with the kale breakfast sandwich with ham, egg and cheese. This meal came out fast and did what's it's supposed to do, filled me up and kept me going for the day. The kale seemed a little old and wilted, but everything was decent.   Yes. I would eat here again and probably will have too, since I'll be back here in a week."}
{"text":"For a airport restaurant their flatbreads are great. The service was friendly and the lady who made out food didn't phone it in. She took great care in placing the toppings. It was about $9-14 per item depending on toppings.  I'd totally go back.It takes 10 minutes to get your food.  I really loved my spinach and portabella and mushroom pizza with arugula and pesto.  They also make toasted sandwiches and fresh salads.  It's like a MTO shop had a Panera feel."}
{"text":"The gobbler me of earl of sandwich's thanksgiving sub. It's pricey, $11 for just a smallish sandwich but it's pretty good. The menu is incomplete and the staff seem pretty downtrodden and struggle a bit. I have no complaints but probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Sandwich was tasty. Go with the Turkey bacon sandwich. I would avoid the build your own sandwich if you can. Ain't nobody got time for that!  The prebuilt sandwiches i got quickly and got on my plane without any problems. Took me maybe 5 minutes. Service was good and the ingredients were superb.  They also sell water, etc."}
{"text":"If you didn't look closely, you would miss it. Tucked to the left of Burger King.   We did the Create your Own with roasted chicken, rye, arugula, lovely thick bacon and a combination of horseradish aoli and English mustard.   Quick service and delicious sandwich. Perfect for a quick transfer."}
{"text":"This was better than expected for airport food.   I had the Portobello Pesto sandwich.  It's served warm.   My friend had a salad which she enjoyed."}
{"text":"Sandwich, Coke and water... $28.  I would get extra generous and boost this to two stars.  However, the attitudes of the employees reminded me of movies showing a prison chow line. I get it airport pricing - I fly 3xs a week.  So most airport food they don't worry about customer service because they know that you will only eat here because you are stuck. But they could at least try.  This place makes the DMV look like a shiny city on the hill for employee attitudes"}
{"text":"Every person that eats here is usually leaving Las Vegas....they've either ate too much, drank too much and/or spent too much money! Either way, their customer base is grumpy!!! Lol I enjoyed my custom breakfast wrap.  The price was steep, but standard in terms of airport prices.  Las Mkt was a nice change to the usual fare we grab on our way out of town."}
{"text":"Before our flight left for Seattle, we shared a Phat Philly sandwich with some chips.  Our sandwich was very good, plenty of roast beef and toppings.  The baguette was also very good.  Fast service."}
{"text":"Ruined my lunch and almost missed the plane. The service lady took about 20 min to make a sandwich, if you have a plane to catch I would avoid this place, service is sooo slow also she had no idea what was in the salad or sandwich. Wasn't just the lady, the  guy stuffed up my order and didn't add the extras I requested, and it really peed me of. But I didn't have time to complain as I had to board. The only nice person was the Asian lady taking the orders."}
{"text":"Was trying to grab some food before my flight and thought this place might be a better option than Burger King. There were three ladies all gossiping, while I stood there not exactly sure where to order. They let me stand there for a few minutes before I had to get their attention to ask if I could order. The one woman proceeded to yell at me for standing in the wrong place, as if I had ever been there before. Finally, another woman starts to make my flatbread, but continues to take breaks while she gossips about some other employee there. All in all, it took around 15-20 minutes to get ONE flatbread, which was just OKAY. Meanwhile while waiting for my food I watched them all be rude to everyone else who was confused about where to stand. I travel a lot for work, and am always in McCarran but will for sure stay away from this place from now on."}
{"text":"This is a convenient stop for a sandwich, salad, or flatbread in the C concourse. The service here could not have been more friendly. As we were walking up the line cook asked what we were going to order so he could start on it. The cashier noticed my husbands airport badge (from another airport) and offered us a 10% discount! Yay. We shared a CBLT sandwich, which came with grilled chicken, crispy bacon, mixed greens, tomato, and chipotle ranch on toasted sourdough. The ranch had a good kick, the chicken was tender, and the bacon was good also. It was a great sandwich. The bread tore my mouth up a bit, but what do you expect from toasted sourdough. Hit the spot! We would definitely stop by here again during a layover. Happy travels!!"}
{"text":"Save yourself some money and time and go straight to Starbucks or even Burger King. This food is not good and is expensive. I ordered a bacon, egg, & cheese panini. They were out of paninis so I got a sandwich for $9. They don't carry butter and the only choice was white bread. I asked for avocado as a spread and they gave me an extremely thin spread and charged me an extra $1. I ate half the sandwich and threw the rest away. I was regretting not just getting a sandwich from Burger King. It would have been cheaper and more satisfying. To add, there were no smiles from any of the employees & they weren't very friendly at all."}
{"text":"So you're stuck in airport purgatory, hungry, and looking for something low carb.  What to do? The Burger King next door isn't going to do it for you.  But the Classic Cobb here will.  It was fresh, had chicken, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, and mixed greens.  It was pretty big too.  Honestly, I think this is the best bet for low carb in the C Terminal."}
{"text":"Las Mkt will do the trick if you need something to satisfy your hunger before a flight. My husband and I stopped here before our flight for a quick bite.   The menu is pretty simple for lunch and dinner. There are several varieties of flatbreads, sandwiches, and salads. For breakfast they also have a few sandwich options. The location is mixed in with a couple of other food spots in a food court style setting. There are tables in the area for all of the restaurants. We didn't have a problem snagging a table.   We both ordered flatbreads. They weren't anything to write home about, but they were good enough. The crust was crispy and the amount of topping was about right. It did take about five minutes to get our flatbreads. It isn't Burger King so don't expect it to be ready by the time you pay. Pricing for the flatbreads wasn't more or less than typical airport food."}
{"text":"Short line, long wait, bland food. I wanted a quick bite before my morning flight so I ordered the Southwest egg tblt wrap and I am sorry to report that it was bland. Absolutely no flavor despite advertising it as a having avocado, Chipotle ranch dressing and pepper jack. They put almost no sauce or avocado, so it mostly just tasted like eggs. It doesn't help that the man making my sandwich seemed annoyed. For the price, not worth it. You will be better served by going to Starbucks (which is next to this place) and purchasing a wrap there."}
{"text":"Yuck! Can you say MAJOR disappointment. Dry bread and just all around poor sandwich. Should have gone to Jersey Mike's."}
{"text":"Landed and needed some food but not fast food so I walked around and decided on this joint. A build your own sandwich is only $9.99 which isn't bad when other places selling sell them at a higher price, same but less food an pre-made. They also have some sandwich combos pre-set for you should the building be too much. :)"}
{"text":"I walked up trying to make the better decision because Burger King is directly next door.    The girl behind the register was new and honestly shouldn't even have been there because she had no idea how to ring anything up.  The other girl making the sandwiches was helping her but wasn't really giving her clear direction   So I ordered my sandwich and a side of potato salad, come to find out they are \"out of potato salad\" so.... that's fine but then when I told her to take it off.... because she had no idea how to ring anything up she couldn't do it and then the girl that was helping her went in the back and never came back out  So we were standing there awkwardly and she doesn't have any idea what to do. I asked her did you slide my credit card yet? she said no. so, I just took my credit card back and left   I then went to The Great American bagel company and received quick and prompt service, sandwich was made just as I ordered it and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Awful service and they forgot to toast and put cranberry sauce on the gobbler. Needs new staff those ladies had no clue.:("}
{"text":"Keep walking!!! Horrible service can't tell if food is real? Unable to use knife to cut large sandwich. Interesting how Jas Mkt remains in business?  Twenty feet away is a good bbq."}
{"text":"This was above my expectations! I had a flatbread pizza, portabello and arugula toppings! 7 minute wait for freshness! It was $10.50 and the service was nice. Tables were clean! What more can you expect for an airport food court. I had an hour to kill, so food is the perfect pass time!"}
{"text":"This review has nothing to do with the price. This will focus solely on the service and the food.  The people behind the counter seem like they are super unhappy. It's kinda bizarre, I don't really ever see a place where it's 100% of the employees, in this case 2 and a manager, that all equally and fully hate their life. I would give negative stars if I could. Rude, and crap attitudes.   The food was average. Not horrible, not great. 3 out of 5. I had the gobbler, a turkey and cranberry aioli that was served warm, probably wouldn't order ot again without a change in the recipe. Also had a classic cobb, it was good  All in all, I will never return, the negative vibe is enough to keep me away.."}
{"text":"Five people standing around with a line of people waiting to be served. You can't have that type of slow service in an airport."}
{"text":"It's an airport option, so you know it will be expensive and less than ideally fresh. The options are laid out in the deli cases, looking sad but accurate.  Be warned, going through the oven takes time, but the construction of the sandwiches, etc. takes way longer than it should given the number of people working and the Subway style lay out of ingredients.   Burnt bread, lots of sauce (not necessarily a great thing), very little of the portobello in my sandwich of choice. It was $11, so I was at least hoping for a better offering than the Burger King next door.  Service wasn't surly. The mixed greens in the sandwich were ample and were current enough not to completely fall apart after heat, and the mushroom had been toasted prior to the oven run through so it was soft throughout, otherwise would have gone with a 1 star."}
{"text":"This is a great option and I stop in once or twice a month when I travel to Las Vegas for business.   The only complaints I have is that they don't serve their breakfast items all day and they have an employee in the morning that is always cranky. I thought she hated me, but after watching her actions over my last few visits I can tell she is cranky with all customers. I try every time I'm there to be extremely polite and friendly. I try to make her smile, but all she does is scowl. I also noticed this week on my visit that all the employees wear name tags except this lady.   The steak and egg burrito is delicious and worth dealing with Ms. Cranky. :-)"}
{"text":"Las Mkt definitely stands out among the Burger King and other fast-food options around it. It offers flatbreads, sandwiches, salads and some brunch items. The smell of fresh-made bacon draws you in from across the food court.   But there are a few issues with it that hold it back from being an airport food option to seek out.  1) It's not clear where you stand in line to order. Not a huge problem, but my boyfriend and I walked back and forth from one end of the counter to the other, convinced we were going the wrong way. My boyfriend called this the Las Mkt Mambo. (He thinks he's clever.)   For the record, line up on the end opposite the registers.  And we weren't the only people doing this. A couple of people after us asked where the line ends, and an angry man in front of us berated the cashier for the confusion. Some \"Order Here\" and \"Pay Here\" signs would work wonders.  2) And speaking of the cashier, he was also the line cook and prep cook -- pretty much every role along the line. He was working hard, and it seemed the few other employees were working hard. Yet it took a while for orders to be placed. There was a bottleneck of people waiting on their food by the registers.   My bf was standing behind me in line, but there was probably 7-10 minutes between when I ordered and received my food and when he was finally asked what he wanted.   If you're in a hurry to make a flight, check to see how the line is moving first.  3) The price. I get it -- it's an airport. Food isn't necessarily economical.   But my Gobbler sandwich (turkey, cranberry aioli, stuffing, gravy) costed about $10. It does not come with sides or chips or fruit, though I was happy to see healthy options offered. And it's pretty standard, sandwiched between two slices of average-sized, bakery-style sourdough.   Again, I was drawn in by the bacon and didn't really notice the prices until I had to pay. That's on me. But now you are are forewarned.   When I finally received my sandwich, which was served hot, it was pretty good. I liked the mix of stuffing and sweetness from the aioli. It definitely beat out a fast-food hamburger.   But Las Mkt could be an eatery to search out when you're awaiting a flight at LAS. That's the most frustrating part. It has potential that could be realized with just a few tweaks."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches I've ever tasted. The \"steakhouse blue\" sandwich was AMAZING. It probably could have been a little warmer, but I almost want to go buy a second one right now.  The staff could've been a little warmer as well, but I don't know how much I can hold that against them.  Would definitely eat here again, I forgot how much I liked this place! When you compare it to most airport food spots, this one is a CLEAR WINNER. :)"}
{"text":"I would give less than 1 star if could. 30 bucks for 2 sandwiches and drinks. Price would be fine but both sandwiches were not even decent. Bread was ice cold and chewy, very chewy. Chicken was very poor as well. My wife's ham and cheese was just that, no tomatoes or lettuce. Menu said spicy mustard and they were out. Nite to self and anyone who finds themselves in the Las Vegas airport should avoid this place. A bag of chips from store would have been better, at least would be edible. One of the worst places I have ever tried to eat at."}
