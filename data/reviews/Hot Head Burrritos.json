{"text":"Staff was very nice but every other aspect was horrible!!   First, I tried to place a large order online.  I ordered three burritos, one kids meal, nachos and two bags of chips.  After customizing everything, I put in my payment information and the webpage froze.  Eventually a screen came up that directed me to contact the store.  Well, that phone number on the webpage was not in service.  So, I went into the store with my two year old to place the order.  There weren't many customers when I went in and I felt bad for the family of three that came behind me so I let them go first.  Well, more people came in but I would never be able to place my own order if I kept letting everyone in front of me. So, it began... I initially let a staff member know that I had attempted to place an order online and was told that none was received so I should place it there in the store.  I said it was a large order and it would take a bit to fill.  No additional staff came to the line at first.  Customers kept coming in. Eventually, what seemed like the whole staff was on the line to try and get out of the weeds I had put them in.  At this point, there were about 20 less than happy customers behind my now very crabby daughter and me.  As I struggled to keep my toddler calm while reciting each order, it was difficult to see what exactly was being placed on the burritos.  To everyone's credit, they each had exactly what I had requested on them.  The issue was the portions.  The only burrito that had an adequate amount of meat was the one ordered with double meat.  One burrito was about 80% lettuce.  My daughter's lil burrito had three nickel sized pieces and a few sawdust-like scatterings of chicken.  This is not an exaggeration.   The staff was very nice and kept their spirits up while getting swamped with my order and the orders behind me.  Again, no issue there.  The issue was the portion size which is most likely set by corporate.  Also, the meat that was on the burritos was quite flavorless.  We ordered the steak, the pork and the chicken on the burritos.  The taco meat on the nachos was acceptable but reminded me of the taco meat from the salad bar at the Wendy's fast food chain when they had those.  All in all, I won't be going back.  Hopefully you'll have a better experience should you decide to try it out!"}
{"text":"Was there twice.  First time there the first representative to greet us asked if we'd been there before.  We replied \"no\" with the assumption she was going to explain but she just stood there with a blank stare.  We placed our order after a review of the menu.  The whole staff seemed a bit confused throughout the process.  One worker did suggest I add a sauce (probably the only thing that's not a copy from Chipotle).  The sauces are a nice addition and the food was quite good.  My greatest reason for the low rating was my second visit.  We went in that day because I had a BOGO free coupon that was soon to expire.  They would not accept the coupon.  They pointed to a sign taped in the middle section of the service line, an area you would see it once your food is halfway done.  The sign states they did not authorize such coupons.  It was not at the front door, not where you order, but conveniently placed at a point of no return.  I was ready to say \"cancel everything \" but my partner didn't want to create a scene.  There were two managers working behind the line and I  expressed my frustration but they were completely quiet, as though they were used to it - like some old bait and switch scheme. It's not that I had an issue with the price, but it seemed awfully convenient for the restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok, so it's a Chipotle knock off.  But they have way more sauses and grilled veggies that. Are killer.  I will be back"}
{"text":"I like it. Not quite Chipotle, not quite Moe's, but equal in quality to both. Unique. I wouldn't say it is better or worse than other burrito chains out there, but it's a great alternative if you want to mix it up. I only review places when I plan on going back, and I definitely plan on going back."}
{"text":"This place cannot hold a candle to Chipotle.  Their sauces are not good.  I asked for some more onions on my bowl and the server literally picked up TWO stringy pieces of onion! Chipotle is generous when you ask for more stuff.  Food is very unremarkable and servers are CHEAP!  I will not be back."}
{"text":"My son and I love hot head burritos! It's definitely a better option than fried food. I get the barbacoa, my son loves the spicy steak my favorite sauce is the sweet habanero. Sunday and Monday they do 2 burritos for $12. We have a rewards card, and it saves me a dollar almost every time.  The staff is really nice, and they treat repeat customers very good. One time my son ordered a sauce that was too spicy, and he couldn't eat it.... when we went to get a new burrito, they gave it to us for free. Which was unexpected, but very appreciated:) I've been to other locations in Las Vegas and Ohio, but this one is my favorite! Very small town friendly vibe!!!!"}
