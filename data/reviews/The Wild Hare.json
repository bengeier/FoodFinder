{"text":"Awesome food. Great atmosphere. You won't leave hungry. Great waitstaff and management. Definitely a destination restaurant. Great road trip from Champaign. And I don't usually do reviews."}
{"text":"Been here once before as we loved the atmosphere and came back again for another shot.   It is a really great place in a small town to just enjoy yourself, have a few beverages and eat some great food.   Had the chicken wings, a corn meal crust, awesome and some pickle spears...this is certainly unique, they are more of a julienned style which kept the crispy but tasty. A burger and a patty melt to round it out and all was delicious.   We will most certainly come again."}
{"text":"Nice place, opened this year a  new business. Had the T-bone steak. Menu selection small. Bar and grill but good."}
{"text":"We moved to Fisher a few months ago, and this is definitely our go-to location when we want to take our guests out for lunch, dinner, or drinks. The atmosphere is great, the food selection is great, and the staff is great. All great!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch at this Resturant.  Great experience.  Our Waitress Lora went out of her way to accompany our needs.  Very much Appreciated. Looking forward in going back there soon.  The food was delicious and their chips are out of this world."}
