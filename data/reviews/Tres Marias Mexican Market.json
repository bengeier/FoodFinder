{"text":"I stopped here for lunch after yoga on Saturday and asked for Chicken Tamale, they're a staple for me in Mexico and run about 5 pesos or 50 cents on the beach or corner stores.  Imagine my surprise when one tiny chicken tamale ran me $10.00.  It was supposed to come with beans and salsa but I got about 1/8 cup of beans and no salsa!  Sorry - it wasn't even good - couldn't taste the chicken in it.  I've eaten hundreds of these things.....so, know what they should taste like.  The said \"fresh\" tamales but I find that doubtful.  Disappointing as I love Mexican and go by there once a week for yoga!  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Happy overall with the quality and taste of everything here, BUT it is very expensive. 
Probably won't deter me from eating there a couple times a month, but if you're looking for a cool little authentic street food taco experience...you're going to more or less get the taco you're expecting...but you better bring twice as much money as you're thinking."}
{"text":"Love the GMO GF corn tortillas & veggie tortas. & great selection of take home meals. So glad a friend told me about this Mexican market."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast after Pilates. Huevos Rancheros were delicious and the coffee fantastic. I'll be back to eat again, for sure and next time I want to make Mexican food there is a good selection of ingredients. They also have ready made food in the freezer."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this little gem after attending a meeting nearby - it was totally by chance!  Being from California I have been looking for a Mexican Market with some authentic ethnic ingredients and that's exactly what we found!

I really wanted my Tajin to season fresh fruits with and they actually carried it!

While browsing the shop, we found they have a fantastic fresh Mexican food business that is primarily for lunch, but you could pick it up to take home for dinner too!  The day we were there she was serving Mexican Salad, Tortilla Soup and other specialties.

We decided to take and heat some items from their freezer - tamales, black beans, spicy salsa and homemade tortilla chips.  We were very impressed with the homemade flavor and the care to create something that tasted better than anything we've had in a Mexican Restaurant here in Calgary - period.
Now we compare all the restaurants we go to with this place, and by far TresMarias wins.
If you follow their twitter, you can be up to date with whatever fresh items they are preparing that day:

{"text":"As a market, Tres Marias earns 5 stars.  It doesn't get any better than this for a small ethnic grocery store.  You'll likely find all the things you'll need to prepare your own Mexican dishes at home.  The food they offer, however, is a different story.

I've only had the opportunity to try out 2 dishes but will update this review to develop a more accurate rating on their food.  In the mean time...

Tortilla soup with chicken...1 star.  I've had many varieties of tortilla soup in my life time and I can honestly say that the worst one I've ever had was average at best.  This one, however, has taken it to a new low.  Some places starch up their soup for a thicker consistency but Tres Marias offers a more brothy base.  The soup itself looks inviting, with its deep rich color and herbs playfully floating about.  But once you take your first spoon full, you'll be sorely disappointed.  The flavor of the broth is just a notch above tap water.  This lack of seasoning sends a domino effect to the the rest of the ingredients, i.e., chicken and vegetables.  If \"bland\" is your cup of tea then you'll enjoy this dish.  Otherwise, there can only be two explanations...1) they forgot to taste and season the soup or 2) this dish is NOT Mexican but rather somewhere further in South America where they prefer less spicy foods....I tend to believe it's the later.

Tlayuda (Mexican pizza) with chorizo...3.5 stars.  If you like eating hard shell tacos then you'll enjoy this dish; it's basically a flat taco or tostada.  The corn masa is nicely toasted and topped with black beans, chorizo, mozza and shredded iceberg lettuce.  Add some sour cream and salsa on top and it's all good.  I couldn't really taste the chorizo cause they were so finely chopped but I enjoyed the dish.  They offer a vegetarian version of which I assume will taste no different."}
{"text":"My family has been visiting Tres Marias infrequently for many years.   Staff is kind, quick ... able to suggest things to try ... been a few months since I've been here.  Love the tortilla soup, salsa in the bags (seemingly very inexpensive) and of course - the awesome taco chips."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but it just didn't live up to my expectations. They do have a good selection of tasty salsas and authentic chips, but their chorizo is definitely not Mexican, it's the same as what you get at a regular supermarket. It's also on the pricier side...for a small container of homemade basic frijoles (pork free) you're looking at $5, and a small mole container is $8! The mole is OK, I've had tastier and their pozole was decent, but again quite pricey...$13 for a small bowl. I won't be going back for my Mexican fix. 

If you're looking for good chips, salsas and tortillas check this place out. But if you're buying ingredients to make your own meals or wanting a hot Mexican meal, try a different, less pricier place."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes yes!!!! This is exactly the Mexican I need and love in my life!! This place is a total hidden gem. It's so unassuming, you'd totally miss it if you weren't looking hard for it. I've never been discounted here, not by the take it food or the frozen meals, I'll be back a million times over! You can eat in the store, they have a few tables, or take out a hot meal. If not, pick up a frozen entree for 1 or 10 people! You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Won't be back here again. Very poor value for the money. Too bad because the owner is nice and I respect the hardworking independent entrepreneur. I used to come almost weekly for the tortilla soup but had a bowl two weeks ago and hardly anything in it but broth. Used to come chockfull of avocado and Mexican cheese so you'd feel satisfied. Had chicken tostado last week. Tasty but very skimpy on the chicken. Had tacos last night and huge let down. Fish tacos were a tiny greasy fried piece of fish. Beef ones were tough. At $12 for 2 fish tacos and $15 for 3 beef tacos we felt like we'd been duped in a tourist trap experience. Sorry won't ever return. Cute place just offers little value for $."}
