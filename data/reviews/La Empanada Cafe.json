{"text":"Excellent breakfast.  Eggs benny is great and potatoes are different from other diners. 
Churros are heavenly, especially the dulce de leche filled ones!
Also had the chicken and beef empanadas.  Olives are a nice touch!"}
{"text":"Another hidden gem in this industrial neighbourhood. I believe the owner himself serves, and he is a friendly guy. I went for lunch and ordered the special, which is, soup of the day with two empanada's of your choice. It was delicious and filling. They also have various Argentine confections and m√†te. So if you are craving some don't be shy to order it. For the price this place is a steal."}
{"text":"I had hamon con queso, spinach and meat empanadas. It was Meh! Nothing special. Cheap prices if that's what you like."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious fresh food made by an Argentinian grandma. Family owned and service was great. Best empanadas in Toronto! Churros are freshly made daily. Lomito sandwich is to die for. A must for anyone who loves South American food."}
{"text":"Delicious empanadas! I recommend the ham & cheese one! The beef one is also good! The staff are very friendly! From the outside it doesn't look like much so it's easy to miss. Nice and clean on the inside. They also sell Argentinian mate there."}
