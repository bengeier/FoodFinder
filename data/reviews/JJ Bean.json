{"text":"I discovered this cafe when trying to find an independent coffee shop near my new workplace, and honestly, I couldn't have asked for a better spot. The coffee is great, and they sell excellent wraps that have improved my lunch breaks immensely (I can only speak to the meatless ones, but both the vegetarian and vegan wrap are legitimately great). They also have the usual assortment of cafe snacks (croissants, cookies, etc) if you're looking for something smaller.  The cafe itself is the front portion of their roastery, and it's bright and airy with a decent amount of seating. The interior is perhaps a bit spartan, but it's done well enough and is basically in line with your typical downtown Toronto cafe.  The most notable thing about this place, however, is the staff: it's a rotating cast, and they are *without exception* the nicest set of baristas I've ever encountered. Super friendly, accommodating, and just plain pleasant to be around, they really elevate this spot to another level.  While the location is perhaps a bit off the beaten path, I really can't recommend this place enough.  (Quick tip that they don't seem to note anywhere: wraps come with a side salad if you choose to eat in)."}
{"text":"This is hidden gem.  It doesn't look like much from the outside, but the coffee shop inside is both gorgeous and filled with amazingly delicious coffee and food.  I don't drink coffee, so I can't comment on it, but everyone in the office LOVES their coffee and they've earned rave reviews.  Their baked goods are so yummy - and gigantic!  I got their spicy southwest chipotle chicken wrap.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but I really wasn't expecting it to be THAT GOOD.  It was really hearty - it had black beans, rice, cheese, corn, DELICIOUSLY prepared chicken, and lots of other ingredients - and fresh.  I was honestly really shocked at how good it was.  WELL worth the price.  And the staff are very friendly and helpful.  Very highly recommended.  It's off the beaten path, but worth the trip."}

{"text":"Serendipity: the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way.  A few months ago I was working at my head office and a coworker mentioned that there was a JJ Bean a block away. It quite literally took me several seconds for that to register and believe it. JJ Bean is a treasure to Vancouver, that until recently was unique and special to it, much like Stanley Park or the North Shore mountains. Hailing from Vancouver, I could hardly believe this was true, especially in a location which isn't seemingly that busy or lucrative.  This location was set up to be JJ Bean's headquarters in the area in the sense of being where the beans are roasted and all the food is prepared for their locations in Toronto. In that order, let's break it down:  -The coffee: If the aroma that greets you when you first enter isn't wonderful to you, just turn around and go back to the nearest gas station, Timmy's, or 711 for your favourite cup of coffee. Though the drip coffee is terrific, I always order an espresso-based drink since this place is so special. The full flavour and freshly-roasted taste of the coffee is nearly as good as it gets. They have a very strict and dedicated approach to roasting and fresh product. Feel free to look it up on their website if you're curious.  -The food: All the food is prepared at this location, made fresh daily and with quality ingredients. The baked goods are delicious, but I'm floored by how good the wraps are. The southwest chicken wrap has legitimate spice to it, with quality cheese and full flavour such as cilantro. I will eventually try their chorizo breakfast wrap, and the staff confirmed that it's made from genuine egg and not from a powdered egg mix. They include a complimentary side salad with their wraps (and possibly their sandwiches too) which is made from fresh greens and has cranberries and almonds in it. The cost is only $7.95 which is a steal.  The interior is nice, modern and very relaxed, with plentiful comfortable seating and very good wifi. Staff have always been wonderful. I genuinely couldn't ask for more of this place and so glad to have it near work."}
{"text":"\"Hidden gem\" gets thrown around sooooo easily. But for JJ Bean, it's the perfect description. Away from the main thoroughfares, hidden away in an industrialized area where workers from surrounding business and regulars happily flock here for some really good coffee and delicious food.   Walking in you'll be greeted by friendly staff who actually enjoy working there which translates well over to their attentive customer service. The atmosphere is chill with jazz playing in the background. The place is nice, bright and clean with no decor except for what's outside the windows and what's reflected off the glass. The furniture is simple but functional and comfy; they actually make all (for all branches) their wooden furniture at this facility.   Now the food. I decided on the  El Wrappo Ranchero Breakfast Wrap after the cashier informed me that it was the spiciest out of all their wraps, beating out the Spicy Southwest Chicken Wrap and their Chorizo Breakfast Wrap. It came with a side of spicy salsa and a delicious salad with greens, cranberries, slivered almonds and balsamic dressing. Also got a HUGE oatmeal cookie and a large Mocha Shiver (frappe).   Hubby and I shared everything. I should have bought another wrap because it was absolutely delectable! The wrap was a med spice level and the salsa kicked it up a notch (you could see the pepper seeds). The oatmeal cookie was scrumptious and I don't like oatmeal cookies (I got it for hubby). It had a toasted grain in it that gave it a more complex texture, hubby thought was rice but it was smaller in size. The edge was crisp but the center had a nice satisfying chew to it. The salad was a perfect side for the wrap and I loved that I didn't have to pay extra for it. The Mocha shiver was made with real espresso, cream, chocolate sauce made in house and ice. It was blended very smooth, yummy and not too sweet."}
{"text":"So happy to have this place in an otherwise pretty industrial heavy, tasty food sparse, area of town.   Sandwiches and cookies are HUGE and absolutely delicious. I was told they bake their bread in-house.   This will now be my regular go-to for my coffee needs while at work."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by JJ Bean today after running out of beans, and boy am I glad I did.  I first had JJ Bean coffee out west in Vancouver & loved it. I'm pretty sure they helped start my coffee addiction, but it's been years since I've had a cup & I'm thrilled they're in Toronto.  The staff were super nice, & very knowledgeable. They helped me choose some beans & offered suggestions for next time. Apparently if you buy a bag of beans you can get an espresso for free. Totally unexpected but now I know for next time.  The space itself is very clean, and HUGE! It's bright & airy, lots of space to sit in & enjoy your coffee. It is in a random business/industrial area. Luckily for me it's about 5 minutes from work. There's lots of parking, but transit isn't as frequent.  The only downside would be their hours of operation. They informed me that they will be opening 2 shops in the near future (Yonge/ st Clair, and Yonge/Adelaide), so hopefully they'll have something open later/weekends."}
{"text":"This is the first Eastern Outpost of JJ Bean based in Vancouver. As usual I did not come with much expectation but this is one of the better cup of Caffe Latte I had of lately.  A hidden gem in out of the way industrial office area. The space is welcoming and spacious. The barista and staff must have bring in the West Coast vibe as they are just so cheerful and friendly.  Coffee menu right at the counter would tell you what kind of roast they are sharing depends if you want an Espresso drink, French Press or Drip. All espresso drinks are double shots so I decide to opt for a latte. The Espresso JJ has a balance caramel nutty taste and the milk was frothed to a smooth and velvety texture.  Here you can also buy beans that roasted freshly on site.  JJ Bean though not a small local business but I welcome their arrival to Toronto. Who can say no to a perfectly coffee that made from beans roasted freshly on site? And all these friendly staff made my stay such an enjoyable experience!  Maybe they will be offering some free cupping session just like what the other locations in Vancouver? That will be interesting!"}
{"text":"The employees here are great! All smiles and helpful. One just came over to refill my coffee. Glad it's not in a busy area - total gem of a place."}
