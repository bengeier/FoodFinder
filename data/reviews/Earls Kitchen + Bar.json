{"text":"Didn't know they had a brunch menu and happened to go at brunch time.  1. French toast The french toast was filling and rich. The sourdough was good and not soggy.   2. Wings Small wings so they gave about 15 wings. Not bad but wish they were bigger."}
{"text":"Earl's is nestled amongst the business giants at King and University and was teeming with suits and loosened ties on the Thursday night I paid a visit.  The place was packed, and I soon realized that this was not only attributed to its convenient location.  Earl's serves up some seriously good food.  I'll be totally honest right out of the gate and say that I rarely frequent chain restaurants.  If I do, it's because it's for a birthday or office party where the show of hands wins.  Chain restaurants don't usually sell me on coming back for more.  Earl's did.  We started with the Tuna Poke Nachos ($11.50).  Served on crispy wontons, and loaded with cubed raw tuna, cucumber, avocado and tomato, they looked like they would be a task to eat.  I envisioned myself taking a bite and (if the toppings made it as far as my mouth without falling off) having it crumble, leaving me with half of a naked nacho, or in this case, wonton.  They surprised me though by maintaining their structure (and toppings).  The spicy mango coulis they were drizzled in leant a nice kick with some crushed macadamia nuts paying tribute to the Hawaiian roots of the dish. I'm not normally a big fan of sushi, but in this case the texture of the tuna and avocado married nicely with the crispiness of the wontons.  Next was the Gnocchi with Italian Rose Sauce ($10.50).  I love gnocchi, but it is associated with being too heavy and too filling often because, well, it usually is.  Not in this case.  Earl's handmade potato gnocchi was the perfect consistency throughout.  Consistent consistency if you will.  And true we shared it, but it was a generous portion and neither of us felt weighted down afterwards.  That wasn't the best part though.  The title of the dish doesn't do it justice.  This gnocchi isn't served in just any ordinary rose sauce... it's served in a rose sauce made of San Marzana tomatoes, burrata cheese and fresh basil.  This, my friends, is the Margharita pizza of gnocchi.  Enough said.  Being ambitious (see: gluttonous), we welcomed the Pulled Pork Sandwich ($13.50) and Potato & Leek Soup ($7) to our table.  I'll start with the soup...although in reality that wasn't the sequence of events.  The soup was creamy and filled with chunks of potato (skin still on...because that's where all the vitamins are!).  It was good, but let's face it, it didn't compare to the main event of this course.  Even halved, our plates were dwarfed.  This is one behemoth of a sandwich.  Piled with tender BBQ braised pork and coleslaw then dressed with a fiery chipotle mayo, this sandwich was a nice balance of spicy and sweet.  It was messy like it should be so keep the napkins close at hand.  I had almost reached my limit but I knew dessert was on the way, so I exercised some will power (says the girl on her third course) and left a few bites on my plate.  I would be lying if I said I wasn't sad to see it go.  You might think that by this point we were too full to even consider the possibility of dessert, and by daily caloric standards, we probably should have been.  But we laughed in the face of those standards and pushed onward...onward to Warm Gingerbread Cake ($8).  Rarely do I find myself at a loss for words, but this cake found me there.  It might have had something to do with the fact that my mouth was full of the aforementioned cake, but also because it was really, really good.  I could use a plethora of colourful adjectives to describe this cake (see: heavenly, divine, decadent) but it all feels so clich√©, and none of them would do it justice anyway, so I'm sticking with good.  Damn good.  It was served warm (as promised), drizzled with salted caramel sauce and with sides of brown sugar apple slices and vanilla bean gelato.  Now on any given day, I'll take a cookie over a slice of cake, but not on this day (or any day going forward where I'm given the choice between a cookie and this particular cake).  It was impossibly moist and as we ate it we debated about what made it so.  We came to the conclusion that... well, we didn't really come to any conclusion, except that it was killer, and we would be back for more.  Whoever is slicing the cake at Earl's isn't stingy (bless their soul) but that was one plate that went back to the kitchen devoid of crumbs.  Now Earl's isn't the place to go for a quiet date.  The people are loud (because there are a lot of them), and the music is loud (because it fights to be heard over the people), but the food is excellent and the service, equally so.  It's a hike from my house in High Park to the Financial District, but one I'm willing to make again.  Three words folks... warm, gingerbread, cake.  Do yourself a favour."}
{"text":"I finally made it through the door of Earls this weekend. I personally am not a fan of chain restaurants as they are usually void of that personal touch that makes a great restaurant unique. Earls is a great looking restaurant. Absolutely. Food was good enough. The service was sloppy. Our server had to be no older than 18/19 and seemed very nervous and unprepared. I wish them the best but doubt I will be back any time soon."}
{"text":"I haven't been to an Earl's in a long time, but the memories I have were good.  I don't remember not being satisfied and leaving hungry.  I ordered the cajun chicken burger with fries.  I am not one for huge portions by any means, but come on, this sandwich was teeny.  It equaled to about half of a normal sandwich.  Also, the cheese looked and tasted like Kraft processed cheddar.  Fries were cold and the little bowl they came in appeared to be half full.  My friend ordered the lobster linguini and it looked like it had been sitting for while.  Looked like a dried clump.  Won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"sorry but i didn't like the fajita (too mild) nor the fish and chips (too greasy), nor the chowder (too much potato)!!!   but i LOVED our waitress!!! she was super nice and passionate! keep it up girl."}
{"text":"Move on, plenty of other choices in the vicinity. Very poor, immature and unprofessional staff who hide behind copius excuses as to why they fail to perform the very basics of running a restaurant. My one and only critical business meeting was ruined because of an apparent reservation system breakdown. A lousy excuse because i received a confirmation phone call the day before - if this system was not functional then how did they get my number, reservation time etc. ???"}
{"text":"Very rude security guard/bouncer and waiters. Showed no respect or customer service for their customers. The establishment said Raynor or Cory was the security on duty at that time. It was not only an embarrassment  to us but also a loss of loyal customers.   They need to throw their ego out and learn to treat customers with a little bit of respect."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting service. Sat down for twenty minutes and didn't even get a single person to get our order. A dozen people came in after us and were all served and had received their drinks."}
{"text":"You can usually expect a consistently good dining experience at Earl's. I prefer to dine at more independent establishments, however we stopped here before attending a performance at the Jubilee. Our server was quite good with informing us that we needed to order by a certain time to ensure we had enough time to eat. The restaurant picked up quite a bit, so we were lucky to have her recommendations.  I had the salmon which was pretty good (but nothing special). I know what to expect when I come here, so am not overly wowed by any of the menu items, although I know I'll be eating something I enjoy."}
{"text":"Large group, most excellent service! Warm potato salad was best thing I had. I am from Louisiana, so I will give you a little give on the lack of spices! Can't say enough great things about the staff, atmosphere, cleanliness! Really good dinner!"}
{"text":"Went here for a late lunch for 2. There were no more than 10 tables occupied in the entire restaurant at the time. Service was the slowest I have seen. Ordered the spinach dip to share, it got cold quite quickly and not enough bread sticks are served with it. Although the server brought some more they too were cold. Our empty plates sat on the table for quite some time as our server walked by on 5 different occasions. We were seated right by the open kitchen so had a view of all the food sitting on the pass waiting to be picked up. Our entrees were brought over by the chef at the pass sadly our dirty plates were still on the table. Our sever came over at that point to clear the plates. Ordered a burger with no tomatoes and of course two large slices of tomatoes were on the burger. Good thing I wasn't allergic as I would have had to wait for it to be redone. The food was okay, nothing to stand out. Plates were cleared and we asked for the cheque which took 10 minutes. We wished to pay with our credit card but didn't see out server after that so we're forced to leave money on the table and walk out.  The service from all the staff we saw was beyond terrible. They spent more time visiting the two ladies who were sitting two tables over who were employees of the restaurant as well.  We saw as a single diner waited 35 minutes for his entree and even then not all of it came together. And he didn't look to pleased either.   This is not a restaurant I would visit again or recommend simply due to the lack of service and long wait times - total time 1hr45 min - one app, two mains."}
{"text":"Earls Kitchen + Bar on King Street offers good food and an enjoyable dining experience. I dined there for lunch two Sundays ago and ordered the Bacon Cheddar Burger ($16.50) with a side of Truffle Fries (extra $2.00). I also shared a Mojito Pitcher for $20.00 (cheaper because of the Cool Summer Pitcher Happy Hour + Sunday Special) with three others. The burger was huge, mainly because of the oversized brioche bun. Both the burger and the fries were really good.  I did wish there were more fries but in the end, I was happily stuffed so no complaints. The mojito, on the other hand, was quite disappointing. It was extremely watered down and flat. I could barely taste any rum and the mint leaves were likely not even muddled prior to mixing the drink. I might as well have been drinking water instead. In retrospect, I should have sent it back. We dined on the patio and it was very comfortable and relaxing. I highly recommend dining outside if you love patio dining. The indoor dining area was clean with an urban modern setup.  Our server was clearly new and at times slightly frazzled. He did not know what glasses to use for our mojitos and left the pecans out of my friend's salad due to a mild nut allergy, even after my friend clearly insisted pecans were absolutely fine. Otherwise, he was a nice chap and we had no real issues except the occasional awkwardness. All things considered, I would definitely dine at Earl's Kitchen + Bar on King Street again."}
{"text":"the restaurant is really close to my office so I really had no excuse not to try it out....   A coworker and I had previously tried to go on a Thursday afternoon, it was impossible! There were too many people and had a wait time of over an hour so we decided to give it a try today at lunch to see what the hype was all about ( we had a reservation this time, which was really not needed).  We all shared some guacamole which was pretty good. Two of us ordered the Reuben sandwich from their seasonal menu, we both had only half of it. My friend even left the bread of her first half on the plate and ate only the meat.The sandwich was nasty and extremely greasy, a complete waste of money! AND I've had a stomach ache all afternoon.  Huge disappointment"}
{"text":"I love Earls!! One of my favorite Friday night resto!! Selection of food are excellent and wine too!! Friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service started when my meal was delivered 25 min after the rest of my party. It ended with stone cold coffee."}
{"text":"After a long absence, my family dined at Earl's this evening and while the food was pretty good I was dismayed by the state of the women' washrooms and outside lighting.  In the womens' bathroom, lights were out in two stalls and toilet paper was out of one that had a light.  The lights on the stairway to the underground parking were out making it very difficult to navigate the steps in this inclement weather.  In addition to this, several of the overhead lighting in the parking lot were out.  As my husband worked near Earl's, he used to lunch there on a regular basis.  He stated it was not uncommon to find unshoveled walks and other life safety issues not dealt with. I find this rather appalling as Earl's is such a popular destination.  Surely management could improve these conditions. Margaret Swinton"}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times and I've been to Earls in another province. This location plays fairly loud music at all times, so it's not a great place if you want to chat. Most of the food is ok, but the spinach dip and mixed drinks are amazing. I did experience one poor visit where our server ignored us and forgot parts of our order and I received burnt food; however, I said something about it and they made sure my next visit was great. I think it's great when a restaurant responds to feedback and I'll continue to eat there."}
{"text":"A good place to eat and drink. It is nice to have variety in the south! Service can be hit and miss but the food is generally consistantly good. Good deal on Monday for $5 Corona. Also, the BBQ Back Ribs and Cajun Chicken are really good - full order is massive. Wednesday is a good wing night too!"}
{"text":"Earls is a really good place and has good things to eat it was a little slow but our waiter was so good and I can't stop talking about the food it was so good not kidding"}
{"text":"Earl's is a strange place.   After work it is jam packed with suits and skirts. More suits than skirts however. Testosterone runs very high. If you're lucky to find seats and you're a girl, you will be pounced on by these devils in bankers' clothing. Or the other way around. I suppose the two are interchangeable. Hehe.  On weekends you have your typical bros watching the game and getting hammered over beer and enjoying snacks.   This is a solid part-restaurant, part sports bar. Good, reasonably priced food and drinks. This place will be around for awhile."}
{"text":"Had lunch/drink here on a gorgeous summer's afternoon.  Blended Mojito = smashing  Grilled Chicken and Baked Brie sandwich = quite good  Wait staff is nice to look at as well.  Overall pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Usually head to the lounge for food and drinks. Place is pretty jammed during the week after people get off work but it makes it a fun spot to meet people and check out a game or just enjoy whoever you're with. Even while packed it's nice that you don't have to yell across the table to hear the person you're with. The tall ceilings must have something to do with that."}
{"text":"We went to Earls on Sunday night at around 9pm, and the place was fairly empty.  For some reason, the waitress wasn't that attentive.  She forgot to give one of my friends a fork.  Initially my water didn't get refilled, and our waitress seem to be busy talking to some guy at the bar area.  I had to walk to the bar to get water myself.  Eventually she did come by to refill our water, but she did the \"touchdown\" with the pitcher, which transferred some mysterious spices into my glass.   The burger that I ordered was dried.  The fries were thinner than the ones at McDonald, and I can't taste the potatoe.  Overall, I wouldn't recommand anyone coming here.  There are better alternatives like Joey's or Moxies."}
{"text":"In Toronto for business so I stopped by for 1/2 price wine on Tuesdays. The first 2 bottles that I ordered, they were out of (wtf!). So finally got something that was stocked. No compensation offered...ok that's fine. Then was asked to shuffle my spot at the bar to open up seats for groups together...again no compensation...but whatever...must be a Canadian thing?! Ordered the crispy ribs...tasted oddly familiar...evidently they found the recipe for KFC..shhhh don't tell the colonel lol. Thought about ordering a steak to which..\"sirloin\" or strip was the top of the top (this is no Mortons, Gibsons or Ruth Chris). Settled on the chicken which was OK. This place masquerades as high-end, but is just middle of the road."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service, the food was pretty good, had the salmon it was slightly over cooked but the flavours were good. Great place to. Ring your family lots of kids there when we were there"}
{"text":"Never go back again for this location. I love Earls but never been to this location before. Loud music, wait more than 45mins, our server brought wrong food, but too busy to handle the problems"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere, it was rather calm for the patrons.  The staff didn't sit around and doddle!  We had prompt service and the coffee always had enough in it.  I'll definately be back!!"}
{"text":"This review is specifically for the Hunan Kung Pao at Earl's.    Copy, paste: \"spicy ginger soy sauce with wok fried noodles and seared vegetables, topped with peanuts, customize spice by adding 1-6 hunan peppers.  Add pan fried chicken or sauteed shrimp\"  Heaven on a plate.  Delicious.  That is all."}
{"text":"This location has done a lot of work to fix any less than perfect service in the past.  You have to give them a second chance.  Earl's is the best restaurant in town and the McLeod Trail location knocked it out of the park.  We had a fantastic dinner and a fantastic time.  It's unusual that a couple gets an actual experience going out for dinner, it was unexpected!  Steaks = Perfect Vegetables = Perfect Appetizers = Perfect Wine Recommendation = Perfect Tea = Perfect & Unexpected Desert = Unbelievable Service = Incredible Hostesses = Awesome  Best time we had at Earl's - EVER, (and we have had some great experiences).  Thanks go to the Earl's team for such an awesome time!!!"}
{"text":"No complaints ...enjoyed their spiced up bibimbap, and managed to stay late to try their fish and chicken tacos from their happy hour menu..great taste and generous portions."}

{"text":"One of the lamest front entrances. Felt like you're going through a side door. About 10 coasters shoved under the table to keep from wobbling. Dirty napkins under the table as well.   Felt like a frat president got a job as manager and employed all his friends. Servers moved a glacial pace. Ours checked on us once.   No side plates with our dry ribs and no spoons for our pasta entrees.   Icing on the cake tried to charge full price for my drink special and stood their awkwardly without making conversation while we processed our cards.   Only reason for 3 stars the food was actually really good."}
{"text":"1)Indoor environment: 4.5 out of 5 2)Service: 2.5 out of 5  -Too long waiting and slow responds even there was no many customers. -Personally don't like the waitress padded my back and shoulder several times. 3)Price: $$$  4)Taste: 4 out of 5. I had the 10 oz steak with no extra seasonings, the steak was good, but lack flavour, mushed potato and sides were ok but same lack flavour."}
{"text":"What a fun place!  I went here this past weekend after always seeing it on my commute to work and so glad I did.    The minute my friend and I stepped in, doors opened for us and we were greeted by the hostess.  While she looked to see if there was a table for us, another girl gave us some bubblies!    When we were seated, we were able to persuade the waiter to get us more champagne.  The menu looked fab and our waiter even gave us an iPad to play with to see what type of wine works best with the entree we wanted.    My friend and I looked up our entrees and wine pairing on the iPad and I then proceeded to look and see if the iPad had angry birds.  It had the app listed but stupid thing wouldn't let me access the actual game.  Clearly that's where this restaurant lost a star from me.  We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip.  YUM! For my main course, I had the chicken and bri sandwich with the New England Clam Chowder soup.  The soup was delish!  My sandwich was good... it was an interesting good.  The menu description for the sandwich wasn't too detailed so I was a little taken back when a slice of apple hit my mouth.  I also think there was raspberry jam in my sandwich.  Nice for lunch, not so appealing for dins.    Along with my meal, my friend and I split a half litre of the Down Under half blend Riesling (can't remember the actual name of the wine).  The atmosphere, the amazing and friendly service, and the good food pretty much made my night.  I would def go there again for food and drinks."}
{"text":"First time at Earl's. Great calmari + Med Linguini. Attentive service and easy parking. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Hatten Lust auf was kleines - die feinen Pommes kannten wir schon. Dazu nahmen wir eine Vorspeise. Melted Cheese - bei uns ein Fondue. War sehr gut - dazu Laugenbrotstangen. coole Idee"}
{"text":"I usually dont write bad reviews because i feel every restaurant sometimes can have an off night. However, this time to many things were wrong for me to ignore it.   I came here after a movie and from the start just didn't have a good time. There was a small waiting time so we were told by one hostess to wait and that we were on the list. 15m laiter that hostess stepped away and someone else came in to her desk. A couple walked in and were taken to a newly cleaned table. Ha? I though there was a list.    A bunch of apologies laiter and more waiting we sit down and it really didn't get any better. -The restaurant is extremely loud, you have to yell a bit to the person siting across from you. I think it's because it's just one big room so there are no sound buffers anywhere. - the menu is all over the place so they don't do anything very well. Dynamite roll was really bad if you are used to going to a great sushi places. The burgers where really really salty.  I mean you could taste the salt in the burger. - the service was really not good. I got the wrong soup from what I ordered, I had to wait almost 10m to catch my waitress to tell her as she never came to check on us after the food arrived.  I felt I was constantly looking for her either for water, or spoon, or catchup. With a great server, that just doesnt happen. The bill was delivered after the desert even though we haven't asked for it. And the soup mess up continued as we found both soups on the bill where any decent restaurant would have not charged for it at all due to the mistake. Obviously she rang in the wrong soup in the first place.  I really would not recomend it unless you are coming for drinks only, and it's still a maybe.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Maybe if they spent half as much attention to their food as they do to the waitresses they hire their food would be worth the prices charged."}
{"text":"Just an update to the original review - while the food was a bit better the second time, the wait staff still leaves much to be desired. This was another office function so there were 10 of us at the table. The waitress came to bring water to us, poured one glass, then started talking animatedly to the assembled crowd, completely oblivious that she was holding the pitcher directly over my lap, and at a 45 degree angle. She poured the next glass, began talking again, and once again poured about half a glass of ice water directly into my lap as she tried to make small talk. She then sensibly recused herself from further contact from us and one of the more experienced waitresses took over. The group heeded our experience from last time and no one ordered the hamburgers. I had the fish and chips - slightly undercooked, and quite unremarkable. French fries seemed to be cooked from frozen rather than fresh."}
{"text":"If you're willing to wait 20 minutes to be greeted and then half an hour until your drinks arrive, then this place is for you!"}
{"text":"This place screams mediocre. Came in late Wednesday night. The place was empty. They sat my boyfriend and I next to a huge screaming party.   Our waitress was nice but the food was just so meh I can't give it over 3 stars.   Would give a 2.5  Asked for my steak medium it came more well done."}
{"text":"Although the d√©cor is rather dated at this Earl's, the food is consistently good and the service is generally very good.  They obviously spend a lot of time training their younger wait staff, as it's hard to find that kind of service from a younger staff here in Calgary.    I ordered the Chicken, Brie and Fig Sandwich, my favourite here.  Very tasty and a great value.  I  will definitely be going back to order this again!"}
{"text":"It's incredible how inconsistent the service around this place is. I used to be a regular customer at this location, but it's incredible how such poor customer service can stray one away from a spot. Some days, (and most often in the past) my service has been exceptional but I find that out of, let's say..my last 9 or 10 visits in the last few months.. I have received one or two trips with good service. The others, oh my..was it bad. Servers who did not care, staff who would forget orders and spend time talking to other staff who were finished their shifts, hostess who just don't care where they seat people and tell people it's fair game so they can gossip about some high school drama..and the worst: the bartenders who care to impress the rest of the staff and sometimes, and this is dating back to my last visit, shattering glass all over one of the guests I was with and not even caring to throughly clean it up. I'm sorry, but there was a chance something could've happened and I'm sure there are measures that should be taken but nah..not with this staff. I hope they found that giant chuck of glass I stepped on and left of the bar for the less than caring bartender.   So disappointed that a company would allow their staff to be the reason they are losing customers. Food's great. Atmosphere is great but the staff..I'm disappointed as a customer and as someone who used to talk so highly of the place."}
{"text":"Overpriced and very very pretentious. If you want an upscale restaurant with a soul, this is just cold and snobby... and ridiculously overpriced. I miss the way Earls used to be, a really fun and down to earth, but trendy restaurant... guess no more !   The thing that gets me most is that they don't dare put another location in Toronto with such prices and attitude because the competition would defeat them."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Earls when it was a garishly fun place with a ton of parrots in Edmonton, no less, (many moons ago). I have now been prompted to write a review by my adult children because, without qualification, it is a constantly great place to enjoy really superb food in a very pleasant ambiance. The staff is welcoming and very knowledgeable. The menu, eclectic, and the quality, well, go and try it and judge for yourself. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tonight will be the last night i come to this restaurant. Not only has the quality of its food decreased immensely (Santa Fe Salad has changed, and Hunan Kung Pao is always served cold). Not only is the chef now crap, but the service at this place is disgusting. Sad part is, the managers are only worse than the painfully slow servers. Whilst I understand any restaurant wants to have a good looking staff, whats the point if no one is checking up on you. Ive given Earls many chances as I livei n the area, and proves to be a convenient hangout, but tonight me and my freinds decided this is the last tiem we come here. BTW - I lived in Vancouver for many years and never experienced such low caliber of service and quality of food."}
{"text":"Definitely the Bay Street type of crowd. The food is excellent - especially love the calamari after a few drinkies. Good vibe on the outside patio during summer. Difficult to grab a table during busy times but if you can swag a spot around the tree in the middle then you're set! As a side note, my guy friend tells me he always meets ladies at this venue."}
{"text":"I had lunch yesterday on that place , its was great  autimosphtare  totally  new look !!!  we had ap chilli chicken it was very yummy , after I ordered Cajun Chicken blackened double breast and my husband ordered jeera chicken . we really enjoyed our food services was great !!"}
{"text":"I usually go to earls on 4th to take in the ambiance and let off some steam after a long day at work or enjoy a weekend evening. But the service i received on a Saturday was the worst I ever received. The server brought out the wrong drink, forgot my order, then lied that the kitchen staff \"burnt my burger,\" they comped the burger, fine no problem, then she said it would take 3 minutes for the burger, which actually took 15, everyone at my table was done, and she then overcharged my party at the table for drinks we didn't order. I tipped zero, which is a first for me and fitting given the poor service I received. But then after a zero tip, she takes the receipt and crumples it showing true professionalism at its finest. We did talk to the manger which was apologetic and I appreciate her listening to our constructive criticism.  As a customer I get people make mistakes but instead of lying and blaming other people take some ownership! I don't appreciate being lied to and would understand if you owned up to your error. Just some advice for next time earls staff."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Earls before and it was amazing. Tonight I ordered the fish tacos. Last time I went to this restaurant I ordered chicken tacos. They had fresh corn tortillas, marinated coleslaw and fresh lime and cilantro on top of grilled chicken. This time, I ordered fish tacos.  The taco was served on top of a flour tortilla, the piece of fish was thinner than an a French fry. Aioli doesn't make a taco taste better. I will never return Earls after the manager was rude. (No I don't want something for free.)Thank god the server, Cassandra was nice."}
{"text":"Not sure about the earlier reviews from 2008 but I have been to Earl's twice in the last 4.5 months.  The place is beautiful, modern and gives the feeling of a lounge but in a  restaurant environment.  The place is full of people of all ages, but mostly  mid 20's and up.  I haven't seen any families but who knows.  Pros - the food is amazing, in the sense that it is a little different then what you get from other restaurants.  Their is lots of choices and varieties - the appetizers are really good - they use different ingredients and the quality of the food is pretty premium without of course the premium prices.  Another pro is all the beautiful people who hang out / work there - what?!! i am just saying lol  but all joking around everyone is super nice and thats from the staff to the management.  Another pro is the patio, there isn't much of a view but can't go wrong.  Also, someone made a comment about the staff looking too 'hot' i think you get that style in all lounge type atmospheres :P  but i can see why someone would remember that ...  Lastly the ethnic food at Earls is amazing! seriously no lie.   Cons - cant think of any cons to tell you the truth - if you are looking for a quiet romantic dinner then stay away from this place ... but if you are looking to break the ice or want to have a relaxed time but still enjoy great food then check out Earls ...."}
{"text":"Great patio. Covered patio and really nice. Good music. Great prices. The house beer is awesome. Try it. Great service."}
{"text":"I ate here on the weekend and was pleasantly surprised  I had the southwest salad which was delicious! and the person I was with had the prawn and scallop linguine (which I have also had recently) and it was wonderful! Our service was a little slow in the beginning but it was very busy (lunch time on a Saturday) so nothing out of the ordinary. And was better as we went.  I'm not one for chain restaurants but I enjoyed my visit :) And I would definitely go back!  Any recommendations to the restaurant? Take a bit more pride in waitresses (i.e. support the idea of them brushing their hair), it looked like some of them came straight from nellie's or aritzia staff. But hey, maybe I'm just not \"with it\""}
{"text":"Finally ate at Earl's last night. Had the half ribs and half Cajun chicken. The ribs were great. The chicken was good, but nothing exceptional.  However, the warm potato salad the meal comes with is really good.  A member of my group had a steak, which he thought was excellent and perfectly cooked.   As usual, the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Earls offers a global menu with modern versions of ethnic cuisine. They offer hand-smashed burgers, premium cuts of steak, seasonally grown fresh vegetables, and desserts and breads that are baked in-house daily so it's always fresh.   My girlfriend and I decided to visit Earls at 10pm when majority of the other restaurants were close, we never ate at this hour so we decided to give it a shot. Although we have eaten at Earls before. From experience I would say, no two Earls would look the same. From their outside look to their dinning and lounge to their kitchen view, you'll never see another Earls that looks exactly or close to the same.   Ordering was quick but the wait time was not but then again we did went at 10pm where there might be less chefs in the kitchen versus going at 6pm, the start of the dinner rush. We started with their hot wings followed by their Jerra chicken curry and the full combo, a full rack of BBQ ribs & Cajun chicken. The hot wings, like all other places we visited to have hot wings, was dry. It was sauced but wasn't sauced enough so a side of hot sauce was placed. Both the Cajun chicken and BBQ ribs was really tender and juicy but to me the chicken ended up being salty which I find odd. It wasn't the Cajun that made it salty since I've had Cajun chicken before so I would guess the chef threw in a\"pinch\" of salt to extract the flavours out in order to give that richness and tenderness. The Jerra chicken curry on the other hand is a whole different experience, I've had curry before but this style is really new to me. When my girlfriend and I tried the curry we both agreed that the curry itself taste different as oppose to having it with the jasmine rice or dipped with the naan bread.  There's a few things that I wanted to try out such as the new Korean bibimbap rice bowl and Korean hot wings and their peanut butter skillet cookie, I for one is a big fan of peanut butter cookies and was sad I didn't get to order it when I was in.  Although the wait time was ridiculous since we went at 10pm, the overall experience was amazing. I recommend giving Earls a try if you want to try something new for a change."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident.  It was a weekdays (8/31/12) and just wanted to go to a decent bar by our hotel.  They have a great outdoor patio area- get there early because it was slammed when we got there (around midnight).   The inside seating area was nice.  The drinks are affordable and the pours for hard liquor weren't light or heavy.  The beer selection was great. We also had some pizza and garlic bread - both were very good.  Place is open late, good good and good booze.  I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Ordered the tuna tostadas which were amazing, great balance of flavours.   Everything else was too salty (the royal burger, the pasta alfredo, calamari)."}
{"text":"Food was tasteless. Floaters in my drink.   Go across and get a steak at joeys. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"I love all the food  & beverages at Earl's.  All menu items are consistently delicious, period."}
{"text":"Worst service we have ever had. My husband and I are both in restaurant business and the service here was shocking. Our server had no interest in us at all . Restaurant was not busy at all. Asked three times for waters with our meal we never received them. Took 15 min to get another drink. Tables around us were dirty. Servers were not clearing/bussing tables.  Still left proper tip because we have respect and understand the industry, however we would never expect someone to  do the same to us if we treated them with this poor level of service."}
{"text":"We were on vacation from Boston and found this restaurant by chance. We asked for a seat by the bar and the manager came over and set the tables for us. I asked if we could watch the Red Sox's game and he put it on for us. From that point on we had great service and great food. Julian the manger was awesome he was a bright spot on our vacation. The next night we got back from the Blue Jay's game around 11 pm and my husband was starving I said lets go back too Earls. Again the steak was awesome, my salad was very good. Every thing was fresh and we were very happy. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Went here for a co-workers birthday lunch. They sure know how to move the business lunches in and out swiftly, and yet manage to keep the level of service and the quality of food top notch.  Thanks for the surprise birthday dessert as well. My colleague was thrilled."}
{"text":"Beautiful patio, generally quick to be seated. Great drink menu, consistent service at this location."}
{"text":"Service was excellent as was the food. One glass of wine at $21.00. Not a good way to end the night won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Friday evening. Not my best restaurant experience.   First we were seated but no one came to take drink orders. Finally we were commenting how strange it was that we had not even been acknowledged when someone (who we assumed was a manager) stopped to ask if anyone had been by. He took our drink orders and a few minutes later they arrived  Second our wait staff was not very friendly - don't get me wrong, she wasn't rude, just not friendly. She told us there were no fries (imagine no fries on a Friday night) and that we would have to order something else with our burgers.   Lastly, when our bills came we were charged for our alternates (even though we would have chosen the non-available fries). Thankfully this charge was reversed by the waitress without any complaint.   Thank goodness the food was excellent or we would have been downright disappointed, as this chain had been recommended to us while travelling in from out of town!"}
{"text":"I've noticed that this place attracts a lot of young people at night and was quite interested in checking out their area and decided to come by for a quick lunch. One thing for sure is they hire good looking girls to distract you in ordering sub-par food for the price that just is not worth it.  Our server who I do not know the name seems to be snooty and didn't seem interested in serving us at all. We all order food and drinks, but maybe cuz we hung around for one hour and a half, she seem to show displeasure, eventhough, this place was not busy during that time...  Any who, i ordered their 'Chorizo Hash potatoes with bacon and I ordered an additional side of brussel sprouts. I wasn't full, but I was okay. The portion was maybe average to light portion. I'd say its suited for light eaters. Now the food was not great or good, but I can't quickly judge them on that because maybe they have other stuff that is better.  I find this place is just a suited up version of Jack Astor's. Just my opinion."}
{"text":"Earl's is terrible to begin with, the mice thing just puts it over the top. Anyone willing to pay $28 for a sirloin steak deserves whatever happens to them.  We stopped in for a beer and a quick bite and were pleasantly disappointed. I don't understand how this place keeps filling with people. A quick glance around offers a bit of a clue; most people look like they have more money than they know what to do with and Earl's certainly caters to that. They'll take your money for you, no problem, and they'll even dim the lights and cast a yellow tone around brown walls to make you feel like you're getting a \"setting\" for all the money. Because the food isn't it.  I just had a few chicken tenders as a snack, but they were rubbery and I was constantly looking at them to make sure they were cooked. Maybe it was lightly breaded mice, I don't know.  Anyway, they only thing these guys get points for is the heaters outside that you can turn on and stand under while you have a cigarette. That could be where the money is going, but I doubt it.....  Earl's is definitely not worth the hype. If you have a crazy amount of money to spend on food, do a little shopping around or check out some of the places on this website first. You can get much better food, a better atmosphere and an all-around better experience someplace else in Calgary."}
{"text":"Earl's is great because it offers many things in one place. There are two sections to the restaurant: the quieter dining area where tete-a-tetes are possible and the louder more lively (albeit meat-market-ish) bar lounge area with televisions for the games and floor to ceiling glass walls onto King street. All in all, it's always fun at Earl's.    PRICE: - Fair. - You're looking at $10.50 for a nice glass of red wine. - Appetizers (i.e. baby calamari; dynamite roll: $12 each.  - Entree: $15+.  SERVICE: -Wonderful! The hostesses and waitresses (all young, pretty girls who's looks obviously played a part into getting hired) are lovely and very welcoming. No snotty attitude. No feeling of being rushed to leave so seats can be turned over to next customers. There are no reservations btw. You're looking to wait at least 20 minutes on average for a seat in the dining room but the bar/lounge will keep you busy til then. The male bartenders are also very decent and do not have that general aloofness or better-than-thou air to them. Overall: very pleasant.   AMBIANCE/CROWD: - Two different areas: dining room and the bar/lounge. - Dining room: low lighting. Generously spaced seating. Some seats can look into the action of the kitchen. There is also a small bar right at the front but it doesn't act as a distraction if an intimate night is what you want. - Bar/Lounge: Television screens show sport games. Bar top and area is busy and usually goes 3+ deep. High tops for 4 ppl are available. Long dining tables that can be used communally by different groups are present. Private tables set against the wall in a U shape are available. Crowd depends on the night and time. Happy hour is obviously overflowing with the bay-street crowd looking to let loose after work. Women are here in groups as a girl's night out. Not a first date kind of place considering you'll have to wait to get dining room seats. If there is a game at the skydome or acc, there are fans having post-game drinks. Generally 25+. Overall: good ambiance. Not pretentious or snobby.    FOOD: - Pretty good considering so many things are already happening in this place. The burgers are great. The Dynamite roll is very popular. Their clam chowder is pretty good."}
{"text":"Had a new server that was slow and didn't know the menu or what allergy alternatives were available. She wasn't ready to be on the floor alone. Worst Earl's experience ever but only because of what must be poor management."}
{"text":"I thought about going back to this chain of restaurants as they used to have great burgers but now that they have decided to  import beef I won't be back."}
{"text":"I was here a while ago and haven't been back. Earl's has just never given me any reason to. But it's not horrible and the 8th Ave location is as good as any to sit on the patio and have a drink. For that reason, it's a decent place and the food is passable. Oh yeah, they also have a great washroom here. As I recall, the stalls have some type of light activated tint that really adds a new dimension to taking care of business. That's my Earl's...."}
{"text":"Half the staff are great, some just don't want to be there.  Food is phenomenal - always.  House beers, best beer in the city, a few years ago...  The Dark Ale (formerly called Winter Pudding) and the Pale Ale were so good.  Then the flavor changed for the worse out of the blue.  I come back once a year to see if they go back, I get disappointed and we leave after one round.  Earls leadership, please go back to the previous brewery!"}
{"text":"Appalling service (paid no attention, no refills, etc at a time when it's certainly not busy) and they've changed the menu. Several items that used to be made at the restaurant now seem to have come out of a bag."}
{"text":"Good location and decor, however the food was disappointing and underwhelming. We ordered the Dynamite Roll, Korean Hot Wings, and the Cajun Chicken Cheddar sandwich.  Let's start with the sandwich. The Cajun Chicken Cheddar sandwich was the most disappointing. Upon receiving the sandwich, we noticed the chicken was burnt, not just slightly burnt, but literally charcoal. We mentioned it to the waitress and she assured us that it was the blackening seasoning that gives it the dark color, and urged us to give it a try...It was not the blackening seasoning, it was BURNT, it looked burnt, it tasted burnt (see picture). She came back and asked us how the sandwich tasted, we told her we had to cut off the burnt part because it was in fact, BURNT, and she just walked away (despite telling us prior that if the sandwich tasted off she would get us a new one). In addition, the chicken was WAY too salty, like it has been mistakenly salted twice.  The Korean hot wings was...confusing in terms of flavour. We took one bite and could not finish. Would not order again.  The Dynamite Roll was just okay. It was over-priced, and could do without the mango (I have never had a Dynamite Roll with mango before). The sweet mango just made the sushi taste...off.   The staff who greeted us at the door and took us to our table was very unenthusiastic and looked like she hated her job. There was no expression, no smile, no enthusiasm coming from her."}
{"text":"4 stars??? Really? Are we talking about the same place?  Food tastes like it's from frozen.  Prices are high for a chain restaurant.  About the only above average thing here is the gorgeous female staff but really all the big chains (milestone's, moxy's, joeys etc.) offer the same now."}
{"text":"service was disinterested.   ordered chicken soft taco appetizer. the dish was entirely sauce, lettuce and tortilla shell.   skipped ordering a main, since they didn't have the dish i asked for off the menu and nothing else looked too tasty.  this place serves steaks, burgers, pasta, sushi, asian wok dishes and more. i couldn't figure out what was special to them.  i just had cheesecake and two glasses of fabulous pinot gris."}
{"text":"Earls is a huge place that is usually crowded, but it has capacity where you can usually get a seat someplace. I ordered a burger and a couple of pints watching the blue jays. The burger was juicy with fries. The pints are nice sized, about 18oz. The bartenders are always ready to serve and friendly. The place is a little loud, so you wont hear the game, but not a bad place to go."}
{"text":"Tin Palace is marked different from other Earl's locations, with a swagger you don't expect. The clientele is slightly upmarket, the decor is a mix of antique finishes (hence the moniker Tin Palace) and grayscale blocking with modern lines. The patio offers a bit for everyone with a semi-covered West-facing area wrapping around to a fully exposed North-facing area that gets sun all afternoon in the summer.  The happy hour specials are great. The $2 raw tuna tostadas with jicama and avocado crema are perfect bites. The $10 nachos are freshly fried chips loaded with lots of fresh peppers, onion and tomato on top. These were tasty, satisfying treats that didn't make me feel heavy afterwards. Both the tostada and nacho toppings were cut by someone with really good knife skills. This Earl's has the chef and managers names prominently displayed on the front door, something you might not expect at a chain.  The $5 mojitos were really good too, with real raspberries muddled in. The 20oz Stella was on special and it tasted like they clean their lines diligently. Five stars for value for money, atmosphere, and patio options."}
{"text":"The manager, Mike, and our server, Kandace, went above and beyond the call of duty. My wife, 3 year old daughter and I went to Earl's at 5:45 on a Friday for an early dinner. The Jays were at home and the place was packed. We were told the wait for the dining room was 45 min but we could try to find a table in the lounge. We found a table, but were promptly kicked out because we had a 3 year old with us. OK, but we were a little pissed about the mixed messages. Out on the street, Mike the manager chased us down, was very nice and arranged for a table in the dining room. Kandace our server took over. We had a great meal (the kale salad is very tasty) and she comped our dessert. Which, was some sort of insane peanut butter cookie and ice cream concoction, wow.  Great job and a nice dinner. Thank you."}
{"text":"First time At Earls and I have to say the service was great.  The waitress answered all questions and gave solid recommendations. I tried the Bipimap dish and it was great.  I recommend sitting outside as the atmosphere is very cool.  Also have to check out the restrooms, cool privacy!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for young couples. We did appetizer and drinks at the bar. For a Thursday it was quite busy. The prices were great and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Worst meal ever, even the alcoholic drinks were terrible! I ordered clam chowder and felt sick afterwards. My mother ordered the fettuccini Alfredo and the noodles weren't even cooked. The key lime pie was so tangy it was unbearable to eat. Hands down the worst restaurant I've ever been to, Earls is going in a downward spiral."}
{"text":"I have been to various Earl's restaurants around town and by far, I find this one to be most mediocre of the bunch. As other reviewers have said, the servers pester you every few minutes to make sure everything is OK. You would think that would add to their overall service, but it gets annoying... particularly if you have to ask repeatedly for something as basic as a glass of water, only to be told that it'll be there \"right away\" and yet, it takes 20 minutes.  These servers seem like robots who are programmed to nod and smile in an artificial kind of way, but they don't really have a sense of what it means to be sincere.  This particular location does not have much competition around and it would probably do better if it had to fight more for its business."}
{"text":"Never wrote a bad review before but this place Earls (Vaughan) truly deserve a bad review. Went there last night.  1. Food was cold by the time we got it. 2. Sushi was probably the worst I ever had and I love sushi! (rice was old or not cooked and wasabi was dried out and crumbling) 3. Service was also sub par. 4. Bread was also tasteless.   Spent about $50, Next time I rather order from McDonalds dollar menu then go back to this place."}
{"text":"Second time at Earls and the service or the food hasn't impressed me at all. Snotty service girls. Asked for water and she rolled her eyes. I'd have a better meal at hero burger."}
{"text":"Drinks and apps here over the lunch hour was a lot of fun. Not only are the people beautiful but the plates were presented in a really great way. The sushi is what I thought was the best, the soft shell crab roll, called the Dynamite. The fantastic outdoor seating area really completed our visit. Check it out."}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times and I do believe that the location downtown is better but I settle for this one because it is close to home.  I've never had a problem at Earls, I love the blacken chicken. My ultimate favorite which keeps me coming is the Dynamite Roll and the warm potato salad.   Service is always good, food is always great and the workers from hostess to servers to managers always look and talk professional.   There is just something about the downtown Earls's food that taste much better. But I definitely love this location as well."}
{"text":"Went here after work with some people. Let's see, where do I start?  Upon walking in, the very first thing you notice is how low the ceilings are. You literally need to be a midget to come here. Low ceilings make for a very loud atmosphere, as the sound has no where to travel.  Talking to someone right next to you, requires yelling.  I didn't like this very much.  You can lose your voice if you carry on a 5 minute conversation.  For the guys, the second thing you notice are the girls. No shortage of eye candy here.  Although some need to work on their tanning, cause that shiet looks nasty!  This place is normally busy on the weekends.   Terms of food quality, not so great.  Only thing worth ordering here is beer food.  If you're really wasted, I'm sure everything will taste good!  Would I eat or hang out here again?  Probably not. There's much better places, where you don't walk out deaf."}
{"text":"Good food. Half combo is the perfect size. My friend Ryan came in and had the full combo and got a doggy bag. Great people and great staff. Go see Seher, she's a beauty."}
{"text":"I find this Earls to have a lot of kids usually, not the cleanest and definitely not great service however I love the Chicken, Brie and Fig Sandwich so have continued to go back - until now. The last time we went something was very off. My chicken had the consistency as if it was raw however it was cooked. I couldn't get past the texture and could not eat it. My boyfriend tried a piece and spit it out. I waited for the waitress to ask how everything was but it did not happen. When she finally came by our table she asked if we were finished and took our plates away. The three stars is really only due to the fact that things at this location in the past have been OK - not good, not great - OK"}
{"text":"Check this place out for drinks, appetizers and dinner. They have a great menu, delicious food, the food presentation was impressive and the vibe was fantastic. I really enjoyed my time at Earl's. Can't wait to come back. Keep up your excellent customer service from your wait staff and cooks, my cold beer was refreshing, spinach dip was unbelievable and my amazing burger was cooked to perfection. A big juicy burger for a big guy!!!  Just perfect!!!  My wife is nudging me to take her here. We're coming by for dinner and cold drinks next week."}
{"text":"Went to the Earls on 8th Avenue on my first night in Calgary when I was there recently for Stampede.  Great atmosphere, but maybe that was because it was Stampede time.  It was super busy, but the servers were right on top of things.  I had a tasty filet mignon, but was surprised that I had to order my sauce on the side, and it cost extra.  As usual, the girls that work at Earls look like all Earls girls do.  Cute.  As long as they are good at their job, then that is fine with me.  Will I go back?  If I find myself in Calgary again, then, maybe.  It served its purpose.  I had dinner, and I wasn't hungry afterwards."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant,  the atmosphere was great, food is excellent and most importantly the waiters were really nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"I have been to Earls several times for dinner.  We love the Rhino beer.  However last weekend we tried the Sunday bunch and were very disappointed.  Eggs Benedict served with over cooked poached eggs (hard yolk).  My breakfast turned out to be a grilled cheese sandwich (granted on sourdough bread) with a poached egg on top and a Serrano cream sauce.  I wished I had just ordered a hamburger.  Service was inconsistent, they were either all over us . . . or we could not flag anybody down."}
{"text":"Love this earls! Its the best one in the city.. Food is always good and consistent, great atmosphere and the service is amazing. Last time I went I had the chicken tacos and they were delicious my server Ali was super friendly and made sure our food came our hot and our drinks were always refilled! Deffinetly  recommend this place for family's, friends,couples I have never left unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Earls might be the best restaurant in Calgary, I can't say for sure because at this point in my life it's basically the only place I ever eat at so I have no frame of reference. I recently moved back to Calgary and I'd be lying if I told you that my love of Earls was not a factor when I rented a place that's literally right across the street. I can actually see Earls from my living room, I am looking at it now. Sometimes late at night I stare longingly into the glowing red Earls sign before angrily throwing my glass of brandy into a roaring fireplace. The last part of that might have been from a dream, I don't think I have a fireplace.   The food is excellent, or I should say the fettuccine alfredo with chicken is excellent because I've never ordered anything else. I think they also have burgers and salad and stuff but I've never really checked. The service is also good. I always bring my own crazy straw because the straws they have there are not crazy enough for me. It's a good conversation starter, a lot of the time the waiter will say something like \"nice straw\". This one time the head bartender guy personally delivered my drink because he heard from my waitress that I had a cool straw and he wanted to see it for himself.   The only bad experience I ever had at Earls was my own fault. I decided to eat there alone even though I think eating alone at a restaurant can be kind of weird. When they asked whether I wanted the dining room or lounge, I panicked and said the dining room. This was the wrong choice because I looked really pathetic and sad. The entire staff of Earls seemed to think so too as various people kept coming up to me every few minutes and asking if I was okay. I was able to salvage the situation by messaging people on my phone so everyone could see that I had friends and wasn't some loner weirdo. I also got some garlic toast that time, so it was actually a better meal than usual. I think my waiter was new though because he spent a lot of time explaining how drink refills work. I've ordered a coke before guy! I know at some point you will take my glass away to refill it!  Overall I would recommend Earls, especially if you spend your days wandering through your apartment in a haze of depression and despair and need an excuse to go outside. I hope to one day go to Earls often enough to get my own private table and nickname.   p.s. When I was in elementary school, Earls was decorated with these giant parrots. At some point they got rid of the parrots and I was able to take one home! I showed it for show and tell in grade 3 and it was later thrown out at some point."}
{"text":"The food here is decent, but not great.   It is a nice place to eat at if you are ever shopping at Square One. This place is good for its location.   I don't usually come here unless I'm already at the mall. The service is a hit/miss here."}
{"text":"The food at earls is always gonna be above average. However, it was the service I received that took the lunch from good, to great. Our server Ben was extremely attentive while being conscious enough to let conversation flow naturally. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and was able add previously unknown facts about the restaurant without coming off as pushy. I wouldn't hesitate to return if I knew he was serving me."}
{"text":"I have been to this particular Earls plenty of times, and never have I received good service.  Yesterday was no exception.  I was seated and ordered a glass of wine and food item while I waited for a client who was finishing dinner at another restaurant.  The glass of wine was served in a dripping wet glass (gross) and nevermind that the temperature of the red wine was colder than it should have been.  I asked the server who brought the wine for a glass of water and she said ok.  The food was brought within less than 10 minutes, but I had no water.  Given that I had a spicy chicken sandwich a water was quite necessary.  It never came.  I was seated right where all the servers were hanging out in the kitchen and after I had already eaten my meal I finally got up to the bar and got my own water.  My client came, ordered a drink, and that was that.  No one checked on us once, refilled the water, nothing.  Our server even walked by with a pitcher several times without so much as acknowledging our presence.  It was pretty disappointing as the service is consistently bad, but at this location only.  I tip generously regardless of the total of my tab, but yesterday I contemplated not leaving a penny.  I recommend sitting in the lounge, having a drink, and having the lowest expectation possible."}
{"text":"I had the Cajun chicken caesar dish and loved it.  Though there was quite a bit of salad dressing.  Anyway the service was great.  And the restaurant itself is beautiful... what a patio!"}
{"text":"I've been here countless times, but since the server brought out my food on a food smeared dirty plate  ... I've stopped myself from going back."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try out Earl's for lunch this week. I had the planked salmon on brown basmati rice with mango salsa and roasted root vegetables (it was great, I ate all) and my girlfriend had the geera chicken curry with nan bread and rice (that was nice too, I'll have it the next time). So I'll be back. Kind of noisy environment but lively."}
{"text":"Good service the food was decent for the price. also a nice atmosphere ."}
{"text":"Went there about a month ago, service was nice, food was mediocre to good. Price was decent.   I would go again and order something different."}
{"text":"I don't usually care much for the service at Earl's - I find it is quite slow and the servers don't multitask as well as at other restaurants. However, the pecan chicken rocket salad (on the feature menu) keeps me coming back. Although I don't order it with the chicken, it is a filling and flavourful salad. I find myself craving it at least 3 times a week. I KNOW! crazy!!! I even plan lunches/dinners with people I don't want to see so I have an excuse to eat this salad. Love it!!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the better chain restaurants around.  I would choose to go here over Moxies, Milestones, Spring Rolls or Pickle Barrel.  They came from out West, which is where I first encountered them (Edmonton to be exact).  I love the atmosphere of this location, and the service is excellent!  I am picky about the kinds of food I like, but for a chain restaurant, the food is great.  Too bad they are located in Mississauga, but I believe they will soon be opening another one Woodbridge.  I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Waited nearly an hour for a foamy beer and the most expensive Jack & Coke I have ever bought- $12.  The chicken and fig sandwich was good, though the bartenders had no time for anyone who wasn't a woman with a low cut shirt.  $40 for a what should have cost under $20. Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Earls in general. Good food at reasonable prices and outstanding clam chowder. But, this particular location has fallen into a state of disrepair and worse yet, is filthy."}
{"text":"I don't think I'd ever consider reviewing a chain restaurant, however in this case I only have one word for you - Caesar!  They have the most delicious Caesar I have had anywhere. It's spicy, it's savory, it's served with a pickle spear AND a pepperoni stick. It's literally like a meal in a cup. A delicious, vodka-soaked meal in a cup. Take this from somebody who used to scoff at the idea of a savory alcoholic cocktail.  I really only go for this, although their accompanying appetizers aren't too shabby either- I've tried the calamari and the crispy chicken tenders.  Seriously, go for their Caesar. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Always a great experience at Earls. It's a very nice atmosphere (better than the crowd at the recently opened Cactus Club down the street).  The food is tasty and reasonably priced. The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for drinks. Menu is nothing too impressive, but some decent options. Outdoor patio is beautiful but gets busy quick around happy hour. Price is also reasonable."}
{"text":"I can't rate the food because we couldn't even get a table.  If you are planning to see a show at the Jubilee, and make the unfortunate decision to eat at this Earls location, I would recommend that you arrive at 4pm. You know, senior citizen time dining.  I was with a group of 4 and arrived around 5:15pm (No they DO NOT take reservations for small parties), our show started at 7:30pm.  The hostess told us that we were to wait 30min.  Okay that's fine.  Then 30 min pass, 5:45pm,  we check with the hostess again, she tells us that she is sorry because no one is leaving it will be an ADDITIONAL 30 minutes.  This is ridiculous with the line up of other people behind us, we had no time to wait.  So my advice to people who have plans to see a show, esp at the Jubilee. Avoid avoid avoid this place like the plague. Unless you can make a reservation there.  The menu looked alright, too bad I couldn't try the food :("}
{"text":"Staff were rude. Glass was dirty and pizza was soggy. Although the atmosphere was beautiful and clean. In need of a better wait staff"}
{"text":"This review is strictly for Happy Hour.  Wow, does this place get packed!  It could be that there was a Jays home game (as some folks in Jays gear) and the Tragically Hip had a concert at the ACC...but my friend informs me that it's packed everyday for happy hour!  Obviously there are no reservations for Happy Hour, and when I got to the lounge at 445pm, I nabbed the 2nd last table available while waiting for my friend to get off work.  Their patio was already full but it was a super hot and humid day, and I was happy to be in the lounge.  Two of us ordered a pitcher of Sangria (refreshing but a little too sweet), and took advantage of the happy hour snacks:  Garlic Fries (good!);  Tuna Poke (really good!);  Leroy's Crispy Ribs (way too crispy and dry;  we left more than half the order uneaten);  and wings w BBQ sauce (theses were tiny, but they piled up quite a few to make up for their size).  The food here is OK (except the ribs) and for Happy Hour, would definitely recommend the Tuna Poke and the Garlic Fries.  It was super noisy and we literally had to yell to hear each other.  And because it was so busy, there were people standing in the aisles around the tables, and often bumping into us.  No different than any of the bars in the office district right after work (Jack's;  the Keg) but definitely more for the \"want to be seen\" and after-work crowd than for two friends trying to catch up!"}
{"text":"The place was packed on a Friday night, nobody brought us to a table. Food was amazing though. Very tasty but very pricy as well."}
{"text":"Great ambience..good service..but super loud and noisy. I was here for lunch with my friends and we were having a hard time talking to each other. This place was super busy but still our order came out pretty fast. I tried the field green salad and liked it. It's light and refreshing. For the mains I tried Kung Pao Noodle Bowl (veg) and it was ok...wasn't impressed. It may be just my taste buds but I found it was lacking some flavor. Might come back to try this place again...maybe for dinner!!"}
{"text":"Excellent staff. Great choice of food. The bar area is big. Enough tvs to watch sports, no sound, good, so you can still all talk. Dynamite roll is a favorite. And the butter chicken. They have changing specials on drinks, don't forget to look at the daily special on menu."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the Earl's chain but this one does not live up to the other ones. Been here twice now within a year span and havent seen any improvement. Mainly the staff needs a serious attitude adjustment. HQ should look into it because they are not representing the chain well."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave earls 2 out of 5 stars is to give credit to the good looking waitresses...  Too bad good looks don't correlate to good service... This has to be one of the slowest chain restaurants I've been  to...  As the bad service has been  mentioned in previous reviews I should have known better...   [Party of 12 people]  Reasons for bad service:  1. The waitress took two drink orders then completely ignored the rest of the table...  I ordered water as to avoid further \"complications\"  to our order...  Sadly even serving us water was too difficult...  I took it upon myself to pick up a water pitcher (that I saw our waitress use to fill up our water) and proceed to fill the  glasses of our table.... A waitor saw me doing this and jokingly said \" you know we are hiring\" then continued to serve other Ppl not really caring that a customer was serving his own table...    2. When the waitress came to bring our food I cleared room for her by moving my cup knife and fork and finished spinach dip only to have her say \"no can u take the plate\"  that had my burger on it...  I'm figured I did my part to help her out...  And I was at the end of the table...  She wasn't required to reach over n e one...   3. The table beside us (which seated two ppl) remained dirty for a good hour after the couple left...  The waitress cleaned up the plates and left the cups on the table until another waitor cleaned the rest...  (I'm not a restaurant expert by n e means but I THINK that's pretty inefficient)   Ok now on to the food..  Overly salty....  Not very good and is not exactly wallet friendly...  I ended up buying the Bronx burger, my gf got the chicken and mushroom fettuccine, and we shared a spinach dip..  Which was okkk...  I wouldn't get it again for the $11 or whatever it was...   Overall I didn't have a great experience here and will not be returning...   So sorry Earls...  You are NOT TooTuff approved!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch. After being there for 10-15 mins without being served with multiple waiters around us, we left. Not impressed with this Earls!"}
{"text":"Went here in recommendation by Hilton hotel nearby for late food having arrived around midnight from Toronto airport. Exactly what we wanted and more! Atmosphere, service food and drink all absolute first class. Selection of food on the menu really great cocktail my gf had went down well and the selection of craft beers was a real treat for me! Went back again a couple of weeks later with a mate visiting from the uk and will def go back again next time I'm in Toronto"}
{"text":"We tried their margarita pizza, fettuccine with prawns and chicken tenders, the only thing I liked was the pizza... The fettuccine was so dry and tasteless and the chicken tenders was not tender at all, what I didn't like the most was that it was overly priced for so tiny portions.. I'm never going back again!!"}
{"text":"My absolute FAVOURITE Earls location in the city. The vibe is always very lively in this location and staff are always ready to help! I have been to this location with my husband and family many, many times and have never been disappointed. Our order always comes pretty fast and it's not too long of a wait, even when we have 7+ people for dinner. Impressed with the quality of food, efficiency, staff and management! Keep up the great work! Only thing lacking would be the availability of parking."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was ok. Open concept, very loud. The food was nothing special. Safe to say I will not be going back.    Service was friendly. The wait staff was like any other wait staff. Just doing their jobs.   The nicest thing about this place was the girls washroom. They put some effort into decorating it :)"}
{"text":"Had never been to Earls until now! Menu was great, drink menu I wasn't too fond of. out server started out awful I think because we ordered waters at the beginning.. but anyway, the menu had us all confused because there were just so many food things to choose from! I ended up having the Thai noodle bowl with the shrimp and it was delicious. We started off with the calamari which was so different and very good. The atmosphere was very cool. Decorated amazingly. Would definitely go back again to try some more of their menu items!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Noisy, filthy cutlery and plates. The wait staff was pleasant and attractive, however the one server we had couldn't walk in heels resulting in a dry cleaning.   20 min for drinks, 40 min for entrees.   Unacceptable.   The food I ordered was greasy and hard to eat. The fries were soggy and cold.   3 people ate for 80 dollars and none of us would go back."}
{"text":"We went to Earls for lunch on a Saturday during peak lunch hours. Despite how busy the location was, the service was quick! For starters, we ordered the Italian style pan bread which was warm and crisp along with chilli chicken bites. Similar to what you get in Milestones and no complaints because I loved them. I am pregnant and really finicky with restaurants these days coz the food aroma makes me nauseous. However, the environment at Earls was great and clean. For our mains, I had the Cajun Chicken which was ok .. i loved the warm potato salad that came with it but the flavoring of Cajun Chicken was so so .. kind of made me feel like a regular spice flavor that you can get from Walmart. However, my husband enjoyed the Sirloin steak he ordered. We finished off with Sticky Toffee Chocolate Pudding which was good but the brownie could have been more decadent. Our lemonades were great and chilled. I would definitely visit again but may be to try another main some burger this time and definitely more of the appetizers! PS: I would like to comment about the customer service - the servers were very attentive, inquiring frequently if we are enjoying our food and also giving some detail about the food contents during the order process which really helped us! And because it was our anniversary, we asked our server to take some pics which she did so with a pleasant smile! :) One extra star is due to her!"}
{"text":"I've gone here regularly as I tend to be in town on business every 6 months or so.  Prices have gone up, while portions and quality have gone down.  Beer selection isn't what it used to be.  While the service still great, fish & chips and a pint shouldn't end with me being a dime under $40 after an appropriate tip."}
{"text":"I love Earl's. Good vibes, good food, good price, GREAT service. The vibe at Earl's is slightly upscale, but still not intimidating. Most people come here are wearing suits due its location in the financial district area. If you go during weekdays/weeknights if you're not wearing a suit, you might feel out of place a little bit, but don't worry all these suits are nice people. The decor of the place is elegant.  I've been here several times and tried many different items on their menu. The food is good here. I tried their tuna poke nachos, baby calamari, spicy chicken, cajun blackened chicken (sandwich & dinner), and margherita pizza. A little too much red onions on the nachos & baby calamari, but otherwise they're good. The spicy chicken taste like sweet & spicy thai sauce, but they're a little better than the regular sauce. I was a little disappointed with the margherita pizza because I was expecting some basil leaves on the pizza, but I didn't see any; it tasted good for a cheese pizza. The cajun blackened chicken is amazing. Tasted fresh off the grill and the chicken is so juicy. I really recommend getting this as your entree or as part of your sandwich if you're not too hungry. Try their Albino Rhino Pale Ale, goes down easy and taste good, only $16/pitcher.  The food price here is slightly more expensive than your average your restaurant, but I don't mind paying extra for the food quality, good atmosphere, and great service. The wait staff and servers are very attractive and friendly. Shoutout to our server Tiana who was very attentive. She seems to know when to come to refill our drinks. Another server named Jasmine also gave us exceptional service and her drink suggestions for the ladies were excellent.  4.5 stars because I think the food can be improved a little bit. i.e. fresh basil on margherita pizza & better quality side fries."}
{"text":"I ordered the White Peach Bellini and the Tuna Poke Nachos there. The nachos were quite tasty with lots of popping flavors and the bellini looked aesthetically poorly done and tasted mediocre. Service was mediocre as well and it seemed like it took way too long to get the bill.  Also, being the clumsy person that I am, I knocked over my Bellini all over my purse!!!  A passerby waitress came by with a cloth and more napkins. Although it was my fault, someone should of at least offered me another drink (whether it be complimentary or not - I guess she wasn't my waitress so why would she care)."}
{"text":"First time back in a long time. I was really impressed! Service, from hostesses to bartenders who served us, was great, friendly, attentive but not pushy. We had appetizers which were delicious and beautifully presented. The patio, smack dab in the middle of all the towers is awesome!"}
{"text":"The food is Nasty! They don't even deserve 1 star. The people there can't do there job and have no customer services skills. I don't know how the manager has the role of a manager.  I didn't know who our server was. It took them forever to decide who will be our server. We were served by 4 people who were confused about our order. The two people with me ordered food but it was bad.  Save your money and don't eat here as its not worth it. I originally ordered a 9oz medium done steak , which was over seasoned. I told the person working there the issue & said she will get me a new one that was not over seasoned. I received my new steak hoping it would taste better, but it was WORSE. It was overcooked (not medium done) and it was a 6oz and it had more pepper than the first time.  The steak was not worth it $31, so I just left earls disappointed and I am glad I didn't pay for it. I didn't even eat it. Overpriced disgusting food. Poor management skills. Save your money and eat somewhere else & don't come here.  I forgot to mention that table was dirty and forks and knives had stains on them."}
{"text":"This location is getting very tired. I have been eating here for the last couple of years every few  months when in town. Dinner is nothing great. Staff don't seem to care and the inside needs repairs or better yet a renovation.  One of the biggest issues I have is that the locations in Ontario are a different look and feel. No consistency and unfortunately for the worse.  Lots of competition in the area and I think the dinner menu is weak. The night before I ate dinner at Cactus Club down the street a much better experience overall."}
{"text":"I have been to Earls before in Woodbridge, however I had never left with the feeling that I need to go back.  That changed on Saturday, great service makes the world of difference.  I was served by Erica, she was amazing.  Erica was so attentive and plesant, she checked in several times but most of all she made great human connection.   When you are at Earl's next see if you can get her as your waitress."}
{"text":"I will admit I have not been back to this Earls since it reopened last year. I was meeting with a friend to have dinner at Aida's. But since it was at a 2 hour wait to get a table there, we ventured over to Earls.   The renovations look great. I loved the wood paneling and the white brick wall where the kitchen pass is. The location looks bigger than before, clever design on their part. Lots of seats, but it does not feel claustrophobic. We waited maybe 5 minutes before they found a table for us, which was great as the original wait time was estimated at 15-20 minutes.   Our server Jessica was great. Very friendly, gave good suggestions and always made sure we were doing alright. I got the Cajun Chicken Sandwich, and it was yummy. I love ciabatta, and it had some hot sauce in it which is an added bonus for me. My friend had a burger, and was satisfied with it.  Despite the fact that it was quite busy, and Earls is a chain that aims to turn over tables quickly, we never felt rushed. I find that can be an issue at chain restaurants, so I was happy that did not occur at this Earls. Sometimes I just want to sit for a while after dinner to chat, as long as I'm not inconveniencing the staff in any way (Example: sitting around and talking after the restaurant has closed. Major pet peeve!) It was a pretty good experience overall, and I would definitely return."}
{"text":"The chef doesn't know how to cook a steak. Note: I only eat steaks. For the last 10 years of my life :)  I went there with my wife, nieces and sister. I ordered a med rare steak that was well done. I never send back food, but you'd expect a place in the dt core to know how to cook a steak.   An added insult, the waitress told me that's what med rare was when I cut open the steak to show her..she didn't know what a proper med rare steak is, but pretended to.   So I get a new steak, and it was clearly cooked close to blue/rare with the center very red and raw looking. I ate it, didn't get sick (nor did I think I would, as you can eat beef pretty rare). But I was of the thought that the chef took offence to my first criticism of the first steak and sent me back a fku extremely undercooked steak.   I have never had a steak cooked that off before in Toronto. And the last part with the steak clearly too rare was an insult, a very unprofessional.  I did tip well as I'm not one of those kind of people, but I would not recommend a steak there."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I go to this Earls once ever few months and have always had a good experience.  My favorite meal has always been the top sirloin steak with the horse radish.  But tonight my meal was a total let down. Mt steak was cooked well when i had asked for medium and they had changed up the horse radish.  The reason I'm giving it four stars is because of the customer service.  They fixed my meal and explained the change made to the menu. Also the Manager Sammy told me how to order the my side of horse radish so i get it done right next time. As for my steak coming out well done that was crappy but easily fixed.   Always great staff and great service. I'll be back"}
{"text":"4 stars for the food 2 stars for the sloOoOow service  I came here during dinner service and it was very crowded and noisy. We waited 20 + minutes to be seated but that was expected. The decor is modern, busy and the seats are comfortable. The food portions are huge and quite satisfying."}
{"text":"GREAT LOCATION! GREAT PATIO! Which by themselves deserve five-stars but then you have a seat...  The service is quick and attentive which is a plus!   We went there for drinks after work around 10 of us. We were thrilled with our waitress - she was great and attentive. However when it came to the bill there was much confusion. Between the time we ordered the drinks, enjoyed them with great conversations and by the time we got the bill the drink prices had changed. That's right - its like Toronto real estate here - you blink, and the prices have gone up!   We were a little disturbed and shock and checked the menu against the bill and brought it to the waitress' attention:  She said \"yeah the prices changed today.\"   We said \"but the menu does not reflect the price changes\" She said \"yeah they probably forgot to change the menu\" We said \"that's not cool\" She ... the most beautiful smile ever... We  ... the most disgruntled look ever... She said ...still smiling... \"I can change the prices back if you want\" We.... \"ummm. HELL YA!!\"  So she brought a revised menu without that beautiful smile this time around though and another lady walked around the floor collecting all the menus.  So disgruntled and unimpressed I tweeted earls about it and someone tweeted back \"please explain further I would like to help.\" Which I did, and they never got back to me. You see, I only have 42 followers or so - I can't hurt Earls much. And they know it.  It's not my most favourite place to go."}
{"text":"Everything is great- food, drinks, servers, ambiance, eye-candy   Make sure to try out the santa-fe salad. The place is usually packed during lunch time and after-work as a lot of people end up here after work. However, don't let this put you off as finding a place doesn't take that long   Never a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Food sucks and over priced! there much better restaurants in the area to pick from!  The Hostest was horrible we ended up waiting 3 hours for a table when i was told 45 min.   The interior isn't bad though nice typical trendy chain restaurant design. Besides that I don't think anything was good."}
{"text":"Interesting place. Great after work drink spot it looks like. We stopped in mid-afternoon on a saturday. The waitresses are really attractive and nice. Service was great.  Food isn't that good though so I would keep that in mind."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located on the Stephen avenue, the busiest hangout area in downtown Calgary.  There are many restaurants next to each other, but I decided to go here because of recommendation from one of shopkeepers in the mall.  This Earl's has a restaurant (left side) and a lounge (right).  The interior and decor were really nice, modern, and chic.  Mostly dark color.  Went there for a lunch but feels like evening.  We were escorted by a hostess nicely.  One server came by to get our order.  A different server stopped by to ask about order and I said we already ordered.  As the time passed by, I saw two other tables got filled up by different guests.  They ordered food  about 10 mins after my table but they received their meals at least 10 mins before my table.  They had faster services than my table, both drink and food.  I was a little upset with the fact that my table didnt have the same service as the other two.  Also, realizing 3 different waitresses tried to serve my table was a complete disgrace for such a restaurant.  It was a messed up system in my opinion. When our food finally came (the other two tables already half way through their meals), it was not a regular food.  Earlier when I made my order, the waitress offered me a soup with my entree.  I decided to try their clam chowder.  Unfortunately, the clam chowder here is not a usual one.  It comes with bacon bits, which I do not eat.  The waitress should have mentioned what is in the clam chowder if it is not a regular one.    I had to flag one of the waitresses to stop by my table.  I wanted to talk about the food and service to restaurant's manager.  She came and listened to my complaints and apologized about everything.  She offered me to replace the soup with salad, which I opted.  Also, she did not charge us for the service and food.  She brought and introduced the actual waitress who was responsible for my table.  Because of this experience, I did not really enjoy the food.  The quality was okay.  On the way out of the restaurant, the manager gave me a $25 giftcard for our future visit to Earl's.  I recommend you to eat elsewhere if you are on Stephen avenue."}
{"text":"Service was good but the food was bland. The dynamite roll was decent but the Mediterranean pasta was bland and oily.  Chicken sandwich was plain and no flavor."}
{"text":"After many of years of a hiatus from Earl's we finally decided to stop in. They unfortunately, must have changed the menu at some point in my hiatus so they no longer have very many veggie options. Since about half of our group was vegetarian, we decided to leave. Despite that, the servers were attentive for the 10 mins we were there. They were also very understanding when we let them know we were leaving."}
{"text":"Horrible service that ruined an impromptu dinner out.  Waited 20 minutes after being seated before ANYONE came to the table (probably only 10% full at the time).   Server #1 was clueless to the wait time and dismissive. Her comment after we told her no has seen us yet: \"oh that's ok.\" Really? Ah actually no it's not ok.   Server #2 that brought appie had a bad attitude, saying nothing to us and doing minimal effort ... Get more love from a vending machine.  Food was ok. After the start to the evening, the food had a big hill to climb. Didn't quite make it.  And to top it off, Server #2 brought the bill after clearing DINNER plates. Didn't ask how it was. Didn't offer coffee. Didn't ask if we wanted dessert. Even had the debit machine out as she was dropping off bill.   I guess we weren't welcome.   We'll never be back to Earls Westhills. Like, ever.   One begrudging star for potato salad with mediocre ribs."}
{"text":"I had friends over from Calgary and went to Earl's. Everyone had such a good time, and food was amazing. I had quinoa-crisp salmon and it was GREAT!! service was great!!"}
{"text":"So.. this review is just about the service.  We had 20 people for a Christmas party and the service was the worst I had experienced.  We would never, ever have a company christmas party here again.  We had to go find our server on several occasions to order more drinks, to refill our water, to take away dirty dishes, to bring cutlery.   The service was so bad it was a joke, everyone was in our group was talking about it.  They also placed a fqmily wotj 5 kids in oir reserved area?? Which was totally inappropriate .  My thought was that because the gratuity was included our server just didn't care.. We were there Friday December 16. 2016."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here for  lunch one sunny afternoon . We had a spot on the patio and it was amazing. Food was also really  good."}
{"text":"Pleasant steak. Pretty wide selection on their menu. BUT NO BOOSTER OR HIGH CHAIR available for toddler or older kids making groups with children a hassle."}
{"text":"I was avoiding this place, but I am surprised that I actually enjoyed it! The restaurant was full and had a nice calm atmosphere for a Saturday night. There wee no obnoxious people and it was not annoyingly loud. It was just a great for a few friends to catch up over some drinks. I definitely recommend the spinach dip, it was absolutely delicious. Will visit again."}
{"text":"I've had the misfortune to visit three Earls' in Calgary since arriving back here a year ago. I've visited the one on 8th Ave Mall, on Barlow, and of course, the Porsche magnet on 4th Street.   In all instances, I was praying (okay I'll concede that I do not pray) that the experience would be better than the previous one. Alas , it was not! To be fair however, as this is an objective review, the 4th Street outlet is the best of the most undistinquishing Earl experiences one can experience.   As usual, we find a chain of casual dining, that has deteriorated over time. No longer offering the vibe and atmosphere of the past. So what do we have on offer? A childish, immature, coquettish alien, balancing herself on 6 inch heels, pretending to welcome you at the door, with a puzzled look of indifference. Not sure whether you are there for a meal or whether you are there to use the washroom.   Of course, Earls does not take reservations at noon; and I've finally figured out why. Their staff are too pre-occupied to manage the table reservation process and will have difficulty reading the names of the guests on the list.   So we stand like cattle, admiring these flirting fleas, waiting to be escorted  to our table. After being seated by the \"hostess\" who then wriggles away unsteadily on high heels, we get confronted by the 'server\", usually good to look at with their short tight skirts, and yes, I'm not excluding the guys,  open white Florida shirts and cute chinese tattoos adorning their exposed necks. Fluttering her CoverGirl eyelashes and pouting those Red Deer sculptured and shimmering lips, the seductive question rolls from her mouth; Have you eaten at Earls before???   Now if you really want to irritate me big time, ask me that question in a restaurant!!! Do I look like a bloody restaurant virgin? Do I sound like one? So from here it's a downhill experience.   Service is at best superficial, pretentious, disinterested, and quite frankly ORDINARY. So what's the hype folks? If you are fifteen, imagining that you are 21, and if you are 40 and drive a Porsche looking for pubescent stimulating company, Earls is definitely the place to be!   For smart adults...look around, there are amazing choices across the street!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I go here quite often. Its a nice place, nic decor, and super friendly staff. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Good Beer, good food and nice atmosphere and a short walk from the Sheraton.  Crab sandwhich was tasty and back bar area was perfect for a quick dinner. Friendly staff and nice patio if would have been a little warmer out.  Would return."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! Had the Cajun chicken and ribs - very delicious! The warm potato salad was awesome... Like a half-smashed baked potato with bacon, cheese and sour cream. Highly recommend Earl's!"}
{"text":"This place is just so good.  This is my second time here, the first time I was trying to eat a bit better so I was careful with what I ate and it was ok.  This time however, I had no rules and it was delicious!  We shared the tuna tostadas and the truffle fries to start.  The tuna was just unreal.  A perfect starter with a lovely saltiness and freshness.  I then had the fish tacos and he had the skirt steak.  The tacos had a beautiful spicy pineapple on them that was just a great addition to the fish.  The steak looked like it was cooked beautifully.  We definitely didn't stop there. We shared two desserts, yes we did.  The Banana cream pie special, and the Sticky Toffee Pudding Cake.  The cake was lovely and fresh and warm.  The banana cream pie was unlike any other that I have ever had.  It wasn't a \"pie\" so much as it was banana cream on top of sliced bananas on top of a cookie, and garnished with white chocolate and pop-corn.  I was blown away.  The service is great and the worst part about this visit was the man to the table beside us, complaining that his party should be sitting in better seats than the other group because he and his friends had more money.   love this place and I will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"First time there.  Atmosphere was great.  Food was very very good and I highly recommend the hot chicken Ceasar salad as a starter.     Will visit again.  Can't wait to try the wings next time."}
{"text":"I love the food here. Hunan chicken stir fry is one of my favourites. It's a shame about the service tho. Hostesses are paid to greet people, but they all stand around with attitude. Servers aren't much better. She was loudly complaining about her boyfriend within ear shot of our table. We have our own problems! Don't need to hear all about yours!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time with my friend as she works in the neighbourhood. Just when Toronto is getting flooded with pretentious gourmet restaurants where you can't get a basic burger anymore along comes Earls. The food is DELICIOUS. The service is really good but since the two of us were girls, the lady wasn't paying as much attention to us as the suits but fair enough, they would give her more tip anyways. As I am mostly confined to the art/design district, I was expecting cocky suited people but everyone seemed so friendly! If you don't like loud places, you might not want to be here as this mainly for people who are work-repressed throughout the day and then let out all their energy after work. I got the chicken tacos and they were so damn good!!!"}
{"text":"Just had an amazing brunch at the newly renovated Earls Bankers Hall. The food was really good: tried the Benny and the waffles. Beer selection is very diverse and it was easy to find a few that piqued my interest.  Apart from the food and drinks, our server was fantastic! Alyssa R took great care to provide a memorable experience at this new Earls. We look forward to returning soon. Well done."}
{"text":"Just want to start by saying that unfortunately I have to give them at least one star, if I had the option I wouldn't even give them one. I've visited this place multiple 10-12 times thinking maybe this time it'll be better than the last time but nope. Every time I go there they manage to mess something up whether it's not cooking something that I've ordered properly or just not putting something in the bag when I order for pick up and then arguing with me saying that it's in the bag. But today has probably got to be the worst experience I've ever had here, I ordered some mashed potatoes(for pick up) went and got them got all the way home and realized there was hair all in it not one piece but two long pieces of hair cooked into my mashed potatoes I've never been so disgusted in my life (always check your food if you go pick up food from there) anyways definitely never going back now."}
{"text":"Earl's Grilled Chicken and Baked Brie on their signature Ciabatta bread was so delicious I attempted to make one of my own at home. Inside you will also find roasted apples, fig jam, and garlic mayo. Weird combo I know, but it was really good! Their clam chowder, pizza, and spinach dip are also good. The d√©cor is pretty nice, depending on the location you go to. But in all honesty, it's really just a step up from Milestones or Moxie's, it is after all, another chain restaurant."}
{"text":"There was a lot of hype behind Earl's, coming from Vancouver.  I have seen the restaurant operate on Chef Michael Smith's \"Chef Abroad\".  I have to say, I was quite impressed with the way they ran their business on the show (I did not know they went to such great lengths to purchase the best steaks).  Service:  Friendly and full of smiles.  Everybody that was working there seemed to be in a great mood, which was a big plus.  The down side was that they did not describe the food items very well.  I had a few questions and it was not answer very well--as if they have not tried the dishes.  Ambiance:  It is modern.  Maybe somewhat like Baton Rouge, but more sheek.  They seem to be accommodating to larger groups, as they were willing to arrange tables as needed.  Food:  There were highs, but some lows.  Naturally after watching the TV show, I had a steak, which was cooked very well (medium).  Unfortunately the steak lacked seasoning and I found myself wishing for more flavour.  The mash potatoes were pretty average, but the candied beets and carrots were quite delicious.  Bill for two people, including two entrees, two drinks and gratuity came to $70.00.  Not a cheap dinner out, but not wallet busting either."}
{"text":"Done going to this place. I only started my yelp account to share the poor experience we had at this earls. My sons meal didn't come out with ours, was told it accidently went to another table, no big deal, but rather then rush it through it didn't come out until everyone was done eating, everyone, except my father in law,  who's linguine had no sauce on it or any actual flavor, the waitress suggested we order extra sauce which she suggested they would have to bill us for, his pasta looked and tasted exactly the same as my daughters who had plain pasta. Final straw was when I asked for a refill of my coke, and finally got it after having to remind her, and was surprised to end up with a double rye and coke in a tall glass, don't get me wrong, it could have made my evening a lot better, however if a kid or recovering alcoholic had recieved this it could have been a different story. We were given 2 free deserts, for their continued mess ups, but we had to leave before we could enjoy them as we'd been there much longer then expected because of the slow service and numerous blunders and had to get our kids home. All the servers were really polite about their screw ups though."}
{"text":"Yummy food, especially the burgers!! Great service and atmosphere! Excellent spot to meet friends after work."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. We waited 20 mins to get to our seat. Then waited another 20 minutes for someone to acknowledge our existence. Me and my sister just got up and left."}
{"text":"Never been more unimpressed.  Wait staff was incompetent, food was mediocre and also cold by the time it got to the table.  Waited 37 minutes for a bottle of corona.  Unacceptable."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 1 star I would, but not because of their customer service but because of the trauma I had applying to work here. I initially applied because they stated that they would hire individuals who do not have experience and would train them. Obviously this attracted me, so I applied. I got an email stating I could come do an interview, any day, except Sundays, from 1pm-3pm, or something to that gist. So I went in on Monday and it was during the Fifa game, so the manager told me to come in tomorrow and she will make sure I get interviewed. I come in the next day and the host tell me that the manager scheduled me in the see her on Wednesday. So finally I come in on Wednesday and write up the application, the hostess working that day tells me there are no interviews being conducted today. So I tell her I was promised an interview by the manager herself. Apparently they hired everyone for the session itself, I'm not sure why I was not given a chance to interview, but wow never again will I enter Earls, and I have recommended everyone I know to do the same. Extremely disorganized restaurant."}
{"text":"A bit too pricey for food that wasn't as good as I had hoped for it to be. My boyfriend and I decided to come give it a try when this location had first opened for just a casual night out. I had ordered the Jeera Chicken Curry while he order the Fettuccini Chicken Alfredo and neither of our dishes were all that great. The Alfredo was lacking flavor, we found it to be a bit mild in comparison to many other restaurants. The coconut jasmine rice with the Jeera Chicken Curry  was a bit dry, there was no real coconut aroma and that the naan bread wasn't as soft as I had hoped, it was actually more like a pita if you ask me. The only thing that was decent was the service, good staff team. All in all, we both didn't finish our meals, not a fan."}
{"text":"Wonderful place. Great decor and service. Food was very good as well. Deserts were fantastic. We were in town 2 days and had lunch there both days. Does not feel like a chain. Wait staff were fantastic"}
{"text":"So impressed with the food!! I think I found my new favorite restaurant! I love mom and pop shops but this franchise is so unexpectedly good!   I came here on Mother's Day and it was quite busy but with no reservations we were seated right away. The patio was practically full so the 3 of us settled on a table by the lounge with high chairs. Gorgeous and spacious interior, dining space and plenty of natural light. Our server was also very friendly and introduced us to the daily drink specials as well as checked up on us regularly for water.   We came just shy of 2pm from when their brunch ends, served only on weekends and everyone agreed that the chorizo and mushroom hash ($14) was soooo delicious! Two poached eggs were perfectly cooked with runny yolks and a thin layer of hollandaise poured atop. Savoury chorizo sausage crumbles, creamy chunks of avocado and sauteed mushrooms layered between the best hash brown I have ever eaten! The potatoes were not uniformly cut or shredded into pancakes like traditional hash; the potatoes were very rustic looking, fluffy on the inside and crunchy like a chip. Every bite seemed like the first and I was so impressed with the flavour and presentation. I also ordered the passionfruit limeade ($4.50) and was equally impressed by the flavour.   Overall, my first visit was incredible and everyone agreed that the food was delicious. We even came back the next day but unfortunately no brunch. Ordered a chicken, brie and fig sandwich with fries ($14.50) for lunch and a beehave mocktail ($4.50), equally delicious but my drink didn't seem to have any basil or grapefruit juice - it came in a cute honey bear though!    With hours till 2am from Thurs-Sat, will definitely be back soon! Also be sure to check out their daily specials like half off margaritas on Mondays!"}
{"text":"EARLS FALLS FROM GRACE!   Service, food and drinks were SHOCKINGLY bad tonight. I had previously given a glowing 4-star review, but tonight was enough to turn me off of Earls for good. As the saying goes, when it rains, it pours ~ in true Shakespearean form,  the weather foreshadowed what kind of night we would have. Please see my list of faux pas below.   - Reservation error - We had called ahead and made reservations. Due to a reservation error on their part, our time got pushed back quite late to 8:30pm ~ we were all starving by then. - Upon arrival, it took a LONG time for anyone to take our drinks order - It took an even LONGER time for anyone to take our food orders ~ we are talking nearly 30 MINUTES (this is the longest wait I have ever experienced and completely unacceptable). It would have been even longer had I not gotten up and asked another waitress to please send someone over to our table. It literally felt like our waitresses were avoiding us. Even worse, no apologies whatsoever for the delay in taking our order. - Waitresses NEVER came by to ask if we wanted more drinks despite the fact that our glasses were sitting empty for quite some time. Had to once again flag down our waitress for refills. - Someone at our table had to have her drink replaced as it was made incorrectly. - Someone at our table waited 45 minutes for her mojito to arrive, and had to remind the waitress that she had ordered it.  - Someone at our table ordered his steak rare, and received a steak that was easily a medium. He was so hungry that he ended up eating that tough chunk of meat anyway. - Some of our dishes were room temperature  - Chicken, brie and fig sandwich was not very good - chicken was overcooked and dry, the figs overpowered the dish - The bibimbap had way too many onions  - At no point did any waitress come to check on us to ask if we were doing ok - we were pretty much ignored all night.  - One waitress was quite clumsy and inexperienced with handling trays and dishes ~ 1) while holding a tray, she lost control and dropped it, and the tray made contact with a girl at our table (luckily the glass that was on the tray was empty or she would have been soaked) 2) while removing a plate from our table, she knocked it into another person's arm - One of the waitresses must have realized that their service was horrible because she complained to us that our table was assigned 3 servers including herself that were all new (i.e. first week there) ~ Thanks Earls! You would think they would at least mix it up so that one experienced server was amongst the group. One competent server could have probably diverted the crisis that was tonight. Another thing, if management knew that 3 brand new servers were assigned to our table, why did he/she not come by even once to check if everything was going ok? - Waitresses had no clue who had ordered what at the end of the night and had to go around asking everyone.  - Even MORE waiting for the waitress to bring the debit machine ~ easily more than 20 mins wait. Again no apologies. - Tipped despite the bad service and didn't even receive a thank you from our waitress.   Basically, everything that could go wrong, went wrong tonight. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Love to go to Earl's after work during the week - if it's a Thursday, make sure to go early.   If I'm going to order food, I always get their Chicken, Brie + Fig Sandwich - grilled chicken, melted brie, roasted apples, spinach, sweet fig jam, garlic mayonnaise, house baked ciabatta ($13.75), it's savoury and delicious!   Great location and love the patio, I found service at the bar to be good, however, the waitresses serving the tables were extremely slow and didn't pay attention to anyone outside of their section.   Overall, a good place to go after work with co-workers or to meet up with old friends to catch up.   Cheers!   - T"}
{"text":"Great steak. Assorted menu. Not to mention the best bloody caesar in town!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant on three separate occasions when in town on business. I choose Earls because I am very familiar with the brand and I find you know what to expect with their food.   However, this location is by far the WORST one I have ever been in. The first time I called in a takeout order to take back to hotel. After making me wait forever on hold they completely screwed up my order - and it was a simple order. The second time I went it was because I called to complain about the major screw up on the first order. They got the order right the second time but I stood around forever waiting. They said a 10 minute wait, I arrived at 20 min mark and still stood around. Not because they were busy. It wasn't peak times.   The third time I decided to give this particular location one last try was for a simple soup and salad. Again, take out. Again, I waited forever on hold while they found someone who was able to take my order. How hard is it to find someone to write down S. O. U. P and S. A. L. A. D.?!?!?! Holy Hannah. That done I was told a 10min wait. Again, I gave it 20min. I like to give a little extra just in case a kitchen is busy. But again, not peak hours. I arrived and.......again......waited FOREVER. First for my food to arrive and then for someone who could ring it through. Are you kidding me?!?!??! The multitude of servers working and wandering around chatting but not doing anything couldn't take 2 min to ring through my order. Good god. I didn't realise soup and salad was so freaking difficult. You'd think they were rebuilding Rome or solving world peace. And I loved how the hostess just kept trying to hide and make herself scarce because otherwise it would be so painfully obvious that she was standing around doing NOTHING while I stood there and waited.   I will never go to this restaurant again. Their head office needs to have a conversation and check up on how's it managed. Absolute ridiculousness. Never, ever again!   Oh, and let's not forget the food - the salad wasn't even made right. I order it all the time at many, many Earls locations. Not rocket science. With all the time it took to get the order ready they still couldn't get it right. Epic fail!!!"}
{"text":"What an excellent experience. Went to earls with my husband and my 2 year old son for he first time tonight. The service was fantastic and the food was phenomenal, I will definitely be going back. I had the salmon and it was great, my husband had the ribs and Cajun chicken and he was in love with it. I also had a cherry Long Island to drink and it was so good! Very happy all around!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for good restaurants in the financial district on a Sunday. Not a lot of places were open, so when we spotted this place, we decided to try it- might as well. The place looks fancy, but you see people dressed in nice clothes and Blue Jay shirts. It really doesn't matter what occasion you are there for. I ordered a chicken sandwich with goat cheese and fig jam. It was so good. It didn't look like much on a plate but it fills you up. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This Earls is dead to me.  Terrible service, terrible Sunday Brunch.  Somebody needs to turn this franchise around. Westhills location your best bet!"}
{"text":"I definitely get what the previous reviewers meant by the whole bay street crowd, but that being said it is still my new favorite hangout spot with my financial friends!   Drinks are well priced and the house beer is decent. That combined with the solid wait staffing and it was a great night out with my buddies. Have yet to try their food, but I will take their drinks any day, hopefully when its warmer there will be space to enjoy the patio!  Bonus: The wait staff are very easy on the eyes too!"}
{"text":"We used to be regulars at this earls and for the most part had good food and good service. Tonight was the first time there in a long time and it will probably be the last. Our server was nice, friendly and communicative without being intrusive. Once we ordered we waited longer than we thought for our appetizers, considering  there were only a few other tables occupied. The calamari came to the table cold, and tasted as though the oil it was cooked in needed changing. The fish taco was hot, but mediocre and the chicken taco mediocre at best. Then we waited...and waited, and waited for our mains. When our food finally came we really weren't very interested any more. It was just too long. The Italia pizza was good, and was hot on arrival to the table. The Cajun shrimp was barely warm and as a result slimey and thick with lukewarm oil. Although the Cajun spice was good, the mix was so salty it was difficult to eat the shrimp. The garlic bread was too charred to eat.  The bathrooms were dirty, garbage bins overflowing an the stalls disgusting. Overall, a very disappointing experience and shocking after years of having a winning formula.  Another issue that reeked of unprofessionalism and poor management was the staff visibly lounging on the patio as a large group while we waited so long long to have service. There were tables left uncleared for prolonged periods which never used to happen. If it was busy there might be an excuse. But it was not.   Don't recommend and won't ever go back."}
{"text":"Did not try any food, just a few of their unique and signature cocktails; their Mojito, Moscow Mule, Marilyn Monroe, and the Bees Neez.  All of the drinks were pretty solid in strength and taste; the fruits, mint, honey, and other ingredients they used were really fresh.  The mint looked like it had just been plucked!  The pricing was about $10/drink.  It is a restaurant but given the music and atmosphere, it's very lounge-ey."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Earls, and it will definitely not be my last, just not back at this location.   We came for a Mother's Day Dinner so as expected, the place was packed to the max but we made a reservation beforehand which I definitely advise you do as well! It took around 5mins to get our table set-up, no biggy.   Once we got to our table though we had one of our tables being wobbly, and kindly let the staff know and see if they could fix it/get a new table. 3 different people tried to fix it with coasters to no avail, we eventually had the table switched but then realized it was because of the floor, and then they fixed it properly with coasters. A pretty big nuisance but I don't really blame them for what happened, just get that tile fixed!   After we ordered a food, the wait for our meals to arrive was a reallllyyyy long time which is one reason I'm giving 3 stars. The table beside us who came later, got their food first and I think they were almost finished by the time we got ours.   Big shoutout to Gary M who recommended the Cajun chicken. I ordered it and it came with a big breast of blackened chicken, potato salad and coleslaw. The food was absolutely delicious. The chicken was so juicy and the Cajun rub was wonderful! Potato salad was creamy as was the coleslaw. Both the sides paired really well with the meat.   Another downer however was my aunt, who ordered the Santa Fe chicken salad, got limes that had already been squeezed! When we let a different waitress know about it, she never came back with any new ones, we had to wait for our own waitress to let her know and get knew ones.   Nice decor, good location, great food, busy parking lot, and unfortunate events that led to an exit of us being extremely full and satisfied with the food, but a bit of a sour attitude because of what happened. I think I'll be back to give them a second chance! :)"}
{"text":"I was here with some friends during the lunch hour working on a project.  The wait staff was very welcoming and friendly, but my problem with them was the food.  As I am a *transitioning* (if that's sort of what you call it) vegetarian, I opted for the salmon salad.  The description sounded great, but when it was served, my plate had a lot of mixed greens, and a very small piece of salmon, and very small amounts of goat cheese and squash.  I don't understand how they justify charging $18 for a salad that was mainly mixed greens, and hardly any salmon....  The atmosphere is great!  I can imagine how great it would be to be there for dinner.  And the washrooms were very clean, bright and fancy (and I like how they differentiate the men's and women's washrooms with superman and wonder woman - very different than the usual boring washroom signs!)  Although I'm hardly ever in Mississauga, I hope to come to a location closer to me to give them a second chance; they seem like they could do better."}
{"text":"Mojitos were on special the day we decide to have lunch here, so we were given a sample as we were brought to our table. SCORE!  As I looked over the menu, I was kind of disappointed it had changed. My favourite go to (Dungeness crab and asparagus) was no longer available. Ugh. So I went with the Chicken and Mushroom fettuccini since I had a hankering for pasta. My gf went with a soup and salad.  Our food was ok, not bad but not stellar. Our server seemed new but he was really attentive, as was the manager (he also checked up on diners as well). Since neither of us wanted to head back to work right away, so it wasn't hard to convince us to get dessert (a summer berry crumble).  While we were settling the bill, a chef came by and offered us some fresh baked cookies - YES PLEASE!  I can't say I love Earl's, but I can see why some people do. What they lack in food, they make up for in the inviting atmosphere and staff."}
{"text":"I normally don't eat at Earl's but I received a gift card for Earl's for Christmas so we decided use it towards dinner.  We thought maybe it'd be busy because it was the long weekend and hadn't made reservations, but we were seated in the dining side right away. Our server chatted with us for a bit, brought us our drinks and suggested some items from the menu.   My boyfriend settled on the suggested Buttermilk Fried Chicken sandwich (our server described it as a KFC sandwich - only 100x better!) and I got the Dungeness Crab and Asparagus Linguini.   My pasta was lightly coated with the cream sauce and there was a generous amount of fresh crab mixed throughout. And yes, the Buttermilk sandwich was as delicious as described!  I liked the atmosphere, service and food - I'd recommend this place and would probably be back again."}
{"text":"The clam chowder was a bit too creamy for my taste and the menu selection resembled a 'greasy spoon' restaurant.  My my prawns were a little greasy for my liking.  The waitress did provide good servcie.  Sorry, but preferred Shark's club up the street."}
{"text":"I had the Fettuccine Alfredo, Calamari, and a side Caesar.    I've always enjoyed the consistency of service and food offered by Earls, it nary falters.  Today was no different. The salad and pasta were both substantially adequate although the calamari could have been a little crispier. I also had a few Bombay & Tonics and was pleased to see the use of some premium tonic water as a mix. All in all a slightly above average meal, but the experience was certainly elevated by the level of service I received. This location easily has to be the most well staffed Earl's I've ever been to, and I've visited quite a few across this nation. If you're looking for a place to simply relax and have a decent meal, I could not reccommend this location more."}
{"text":"Where do I begin.... We went to Earl's for a friend's birthday; the group of ladies I was with came about three minutes after the ladies at the table had ordered their food. The waiter came back to the table and took our orders about 3-5 minutes after that, but the ladies that were at the table first received and managed to eat their meals entirely before ours even hit the table (about a 20-25 minute time difference.)  Then my meal came. I ordered a steak, medium rare. It was black on top. A friend of mine had ordered her steak medium and it was lighter then mine. I told the waiter that my steak was black and she looked at me like a deer caught in headlights. I then asked her if she would please send it back (heartbreaking since I waited so long for it) and have a medium-rare steak brought out. She agreed. She took the plate with my beets and my mashed potatoes and apologized. She and I were both polite about it; shit happens so I waited. She brought the beets back out since I'm sure her manager told her to keep something on the table for me. Kinda wanted them with my steak, but whatever... I ate them. After about ten minutes she brought out a plate with my mashed potates on it. I had to laugh at this point. What am I going to eat my steak with? I was getting my meal in increments. I politely asked her if she could have the potatoes sent back and come with my steak, and she shook her head and said yes, of course. I'm sure she could tell my frustration by this point.  When I got my steak it was still very small and darker then it should have been on top, however it wasn't as bad as the initial order and by that time I would have eaten a raw cow. I spent way too long waiting on my food that day and was really disappointed since the place came so highly recommended.   On the plus side, I was credited for my meal and only paid for my drink which shows that they took responsibility for the screw up. They also make really great beets with sour cream and pistachios. Maybe I'll stick to quick bites next time."}
{"text":"I've never had a waiter demand a bribe, and least of all never heard of a similar story.  We had a late dinner with few friends in their 40s who admittedly had too much beer earlier in the night.  We were quiet but my friend unfortunately ended up throwing up.  The waiter came over upset 5 times throughout the meal and harassed  us with long winded assertive lectures about drinking.  Eventually, I  asked to see the manager to offer to pay the cleanup bill. I  ask the manager to put an end to his employee's harassment and obvious biased dislike for our personal choices on alcohol.     The manager said it was okay and there was no need to pay a cleanup fee.  However, the waiter continued to be upset even after a 20% tip and on our way out he threaten to called the police unless we paid him $50.   Being from out of town we complied, but this is on my top 10 list of strangest life experiences in the last 40 years."}
{"text":"Patio en plein air, dans le centre-ville de Toronto, dans le coeur financier. On y mange bien, on y boit bien, mais rien d'autre √† signaler pour l'instant."}
{"text":"You asked me to wait in a long line when I told you my friends were seated at a table inside. Thank you for the terrible service."}
{"text":"While I'm typically not a fan of chain restaurants, I must admit I was impressed by this Earl's. I have a corn intolerance which always makes going out to eat a bit of a gamble. It's often hard to know exactly what menu items may include a hidden corn ingredient (you might be surprised where you'll find corn or corn-derived products). Fortunately, the staff at Earl's proved more-than-understanding of my challenge. Chris and Amy showed the utmost concern and went out of their way to check with the kitchen staff to see if the Hunan Kung Pao contained corn products (it does). Luckily, the Pecan chicken Rocket Salad was corn-free and very tasty.   After my great experience at this Earl's, I learned that maybe I shouldn't be so quick to judge a restaurant just because it's a chain. Some chains, like this one, do it up right!"}
{"text":"Came here last night with friends for after-work drinks and to scope out the scene.  Perhaps that was my first mistake.  I arrived first - just after 6. The patio was already packed (second mistake?) and my friends and I waited in line for some 15-20 minutes before opting to head into the lounge instead.  That area wasn't as packed as the patio in comparison, but it was still crowded. We managed to get a table to stand at, but it was WAY too loud. And the drinks? $10.50 for a gin-and-tonic, and $17 for a 9-ouncer of Pinot Grigio (or $12 if you go for the 6-ounce). Perhaps that's expected for the financial district, but I found that a wee bit steep.  Meeehhh ...  Perhaps if I had come here to eat instead of trying to find singles to chat up, I'd have a different perception. But as it stands, I wasn't terribly impressed. I'm not sure if I'll be back here."}
{"text":"It's big! It's bustling! It's really loud! It's packed!  If you want to drink and ogle people in suits after work the patio is the place for you.  If you want to eat some great BBQ food (rib night is worth the trek) ask for a seat indoors.  The patio / drink servers are NOT very good - even late at night when the crowds have gone home and it is substantially quieter than after biz hours. They are more interested in posing than serving. Or else they are 'missing in action.' It's impossible to get a 2nd drink without getting out of your chair and chasing down anyone who would be willing to get you one and / or find your waitress. That's been my experience SEVERAL times late on a Friday or Saturday after seeing a film.  However, the service level for eating indoors is really great. They're all young, fun, enthusiastic, happy to serve and knowledgeable about the menu. I love the ribs and I'll be back for another rack soon.  All the friends I have taken to Earl's have really enjoyed it and they've turned on their friends."}
{"text":"My parents went to Earls a few nights ago for a nice family dinner but long story short it was very mediocre. I specifically asked for a burger without tomatoes or mayo, and when my burger I get tomatoes and mayo on it. Our table utensils were mostly dirty with 3 dirty spoons, and to top it off My parents asked for a glass of wine that took almost 20 minutes for. Not very impressed this time around"}
{"text":"Had dinner with family (including toddler) at 8pm on a Friday night, walked right in with no wait. Services was excellent, had the stake dinner- was cooked exactly as we had asked. They have no kids menu but have small size portions available. My toddler had the Alfredo, was very good.  Best part was the dessert.  Great place for large groups as they have big tables. Only down side was it can get a bit loud but otherwise was a great experience"}
{"text":"We're new to the city and decided to venture out into our neighbourhood. We decided on Earls and looooved it. The Caesars are hands down the best we've had! Service was great because the server was friendly but not constantly at our table, and the food was perfectly cooked. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Wine was served in a dirty glass, ALL our meals came out cold. Very disappointing for trying out a nice popular spot on a sunny day. Will never come back."}
{"text":"Earls in Toronto - where the elite meet to seek meat, eat meet and enjoy copious alcoholic treats.  For whatever reason, the Toronto version of Western Canada's venerable (I use that term generously) chain resto-bar is one of the hottest places to be downtown on a Thursday night.    The attraction here seems to be the cramming of as many of the aspirationally upscale denizens of Bay St under one roof (and patio when viable)  Straight up, this place is such a meat market, I'm not sure that if a vegan walked through the doors they could avoid the feeling of having transgressed.   The food is good-ish - above average bar food - nothing particularly innovative but nothing offensive either.  The one common element was a general heaviness to everything - even the so-called light stuff seemed to possess an atomic weight on the hefty side of the culinary periodic table.   Earl's presents a popular formula for success.  If you're looking for a place to bring a large group right downtown you could certainly do worse.  While some of my friends actually look forward to going here, for me, it's the essential compromise.  You know, the place you end up at after asking \"Can't we go somewhere better?\"  It's better, not at all great, but better."}
{"text":"There's nothing I can complain about from my three visits to Earls.  I was in Toronto for a conference and I ended up here on a recommendation from a friend on the first night of my trip.  That said, in the following 3 days, I came back twice.   Food was good, ambiance was good, staff was good, and in all, I really liked this place. My favorites included the filet with truffle butter, and the dragon roll on the appetizer list.  They have a really nice patio. But outside, or in, the place is really slick.  The staff was both accommodating and friendly."}
{"text":"Lasting Impression: Woah! I like you just as much as I do in BC!  Service is a huge thing here. From the hostesses, to the manager, the server itself, everyone is just plain, ol' nice. Our waiter seemed a little nervous for some reason, maybe he's new.  Food was delish; it was your standard Milestones-y fare with some twists. I had the Los Cablos Chicken Tacos with the soup of the day, a chicken and rice, Indian style thing. The meal was a lot more filling than it appeared to be! I did really like the tacos, a bit different than the ones I had in Kelowna. There were only two of these ones, but they were bigger. Also noted, they were pre-hotsauced. My bad, my mouth was on fire after I cleaned out extra sauce provided.   The soup was ok. It came with julienned apple and red pepper on top. Apple seemed like kind of a random addition but once mixed in, it didn't really matter. Gorgeous presentation for it all! Seriously, even coffee came out on a platter with all of the possible fixings.   I'll be back for the food, smiles and to relive some glory British Columbian days."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to Earls and it is very popular so if you don't have a reservation after 5:00pm (any night) you will have to wait a long time. The food is great and I have always had great service. I love the Bellini and the Chicken and Brie Sandwich."}
{"text":"We arrived at 7:45 PM on a Saturday night, to eat and enjoy two great Hockey Games the World Juniors and the Calgary Edmonton game.  We were told to seat ourselves which we did, finding a booth.  The games were on but volume turned off and an electronic music which wasn't music but just a repeating beat no music.  Okay in the restaurant, music okay but in the bar/lounge area?  It should be less music, more tv volume.  We are in the sports area of course.  Our server arrived a few minutes after we arrived to clean off the table. Yes give her points for this. She offers us a menu for drinks. We chose our drinks very quickly.  We then order the food a few minutes later. Music is bad, affecting our focusing on the game.  The food arrives shortly later. The Chicken tenders were great as well as the Fish n fries/chips.   The fries were terrible like store bought so minus points on Fries. The food was overall great. The server checked back with us, several times even though busy. The manager dropped by, without being asked and he offered to refill my drink. This was extra points for them.  We were constantly being acknowledged as if they were expecting comments or were we VIP's?  Our food and dining experience was great.  Will I return here, yes I would.  The menu was not everything I personally like due to my dietary restriction, ( allergies etc) but If I could eat more things I would.  It was a busy Saturday night but we were treated as special guests.  The parking lot was nice and clean, but due to busy, I had to park towards the back. It is lighted enough not to worry those whom might worry about parking back from restaurant.  It was ice free.  Our only downside was the music being too loud. The fries, not to my liking but still managed to eat them."}
{"text":"Everything was great but our waitress made the experience horrible. Everything took 40 minutes. We asked for water 4 times it never came until we had to ask the manager for water. Paying the bill took another 40 minutes on an average night."}
{"text":"Dined at Earls Kitchen + Bar this evening with a friend. We started off the night with a refreshing Coconut & Mint Margaritas, which was actually not on the menu for the day but our wonderful host made it happen just for us :) While my Kung Pao dish lacked a bit of flavour, my friend could not stop raving about her Bibimbap. We enjoyed the fresh banana cream pie and cannot wait to come back to try the toffee pudding (which was our original order but they unfortunately ran out by the time we had ordered so we went with the second best option).  Overall, great experience and cool vibe. Would love to come back sometime to try the other dishes! And I must say that the customer service was on point :) Thank you to our kind servers and host for making this a fantastic first experience at Earls!"}
{"text":"V√§nlig och mysig milj√∂ √§ven om landsv√§gen kan vara n√•gorlunda h√∂gljudd ibland. Jag provade deras entrec√¥te, och var inte helt √∂vertygad. Bra smak men portionerna var lite f√∂r taniga f√∂r min smak. Kommer definitivt komma tillbaks och testa fler varmr√§tter.   P.S. G√∂r dig sj√§lv en tj√§nst och prova deras cocktails. Underbara! D.S."}
{"text":"It is a bit weird to give a chain restaurant 5 stars... because they're generally not that great, but these guys have excellent service, and food is really nice seasoned, well cooked, I mean, yes it is a chain place, but I tell you it is really good and worth the drive (for me anyways as I'm on the other side of the city). It works really well for going with friends and/or family."}
{"text":"I placed an order with skip the dishes and forgot to add items, after placing a second order the staff was kind enough to package everything up for me so I didn't need to send a second courier. They were very polite snd professional. They called to double check that everything had been delivered. Superlative customer service. They really overcame the adversity that is SkipTheDishes.  The food was top notch and I enjoyed every bite.  Excellent work!!"}
{"text":"I came in from California. I was told by a friend I had to try Earls. I had a great meal with the BBQ ribs, chicken, warm potato salad and a Caesar to drink. I also received very good service and my friend and I enjoyed the conversation with the server. When in Calgary check out Earls, it will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Just nipped in here for a snack, and will return sandwich was superb, and waiting staff were really nice and helpful"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service, great atmosphere. The spinach cheese dip is delicious. The salmon with the caper and dill sauce on top was amazing. also the carrots were unreal good. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"In an extremely bizarre restaurant experience, we were seated by the hostess and then ignored for HALF AN HOUR. Literally, nobody came to take our order, or even give us water. After half an hour, we decided to leave and find somewhere else to eat. As we were walking out, the hostess thought that we'd finished our meal and chirpily said goodbye. What on earth?"}
{"text":"Though my review cannot accurately depict Earls on a normal night, I must say the Steak Redemption Event was amazing!   Service was impeccable and everyone was super attentive. There was approximately four people eyeing our table at once. Water glasses were constantly filled, and we were given complimentary steak knives to take home!  The steak on their menu is a bit limited, and did not include my favorite cuts (ie. prime rib, filet mignon, tenderloin). Nonetheless, I ordered the blackened strip loin at medium rare, and it came out perfect. Cutting the steak in half, the center is nice and pink with the outside still being tender and juicy. Other cuts include: sirloin and rib eye - prices for their steak range from $25-30+ comparable to the price range at The Keg.   To complete/update my review, I'll need to visit Earls again and test their consistency - otherwise, Earls is definitely upping their game from a kitchen/bar to steak redemptioners!"}
{"text":"Earl's is located in the heart of the Financial District and is one of the few places that you can get a descent dinner without having to pay Bay street prices.  The location is huge, ample seating though reservations are highly recommended.  I was surprised to see this place packed on a Thursday night in January!  Service was great - we had a large group of 10 and our server was able to split the bills for our table.  I really enjoyed the spinach dip and caesar salad.  The fish tacos were unfortunately lack-lustre, the fish was over-cooked.   I am glad to see that the western chain is doing well in Toronto.  I will be back to Earl's and you should definitely check it out if you are in the Bay street area."}
{"text":"Earl's is fantastic. Their drinks, appetizers and service create a wonderful dining experience. I couldn't recommend this place more.   I highly urge people to try their Caesars. I am a Caesar fanatic and am proud to say Earl's Kitchen and Bar serves my favourite caesar (so far) in the city. It is not only the perfect blend of spicy and savoury but also comes with a pepperoni stick and pickle. So pretty much the drink comes with a complimentary snack. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Holy cow, who shrank the food?!  I used to come here all the time for lunch and ordered the sante fe chicken salad.  This time it was much smaller than I remember it and definitely not worth $18.  I suspect my fondness for Earl's wil end soon."}
{"text":"Had a late night dinner reservation at the Skylon tower and was searching for a place to have drinks and appetizers so we would last the night.  Wandered over to Earl's and couldn't believe how packed this place was on a Monday evening, mostly well dressed clientele from the Financial District who were apparently there for Happy Hour.    Had a couple of the pineapple ginger margaritas (all margaritas were included in the Happy Hour special) and the spinach dip.  Excellent choice, nice presentation, and we managed to get the last table outside with views of skyscrapers all around.  Service was terrific, would come back often if I lived there!"}
{"text":"I'll start with the positive. I really loved the ambience and the crowd. We sat on the patio and it was a lovely night so it was really enjoyable and the people around all seemed mature. Also, the cocktails were nice. The let downs were that the server (who didn't look at all enthusiastic to be there) told us the electricity in the kitchen went off so not the whole menu would be available, there was also no more rice (???) and that the kitchen would have to close early for the night. I ordered a simple salad with tofu and it was about $18 which I think is ridiculous because it was nothing spectacular. Magically, rice was available again so we ordered sushi and I've tasted way better sushi in the city than that. All in all, it's a really nice place to have a drink with friends and sit on the patio but unfortunately I didn't have a good experience with the food and service."}
{"text":"I don't know about this place. Have you ever been somewhere and thought \"close, but not quite.\"? Well this is the place. I'll explain the low rating.  The decor is alright. It's kind of nice. The problem with it is, I can't get past the idea that I'm inside of a mall. I'm not big on malls, they feel tacky overall, and that really takes away from the appeal of this place.  The food isn't bad either. The one time I went I had a Cajun chicken sandwich. It was actually quite good. The price though... it was like twenty dollars. I'm never opposed to spend money on good food, but I found the price pretty ballsy... for a place attached to a mall...  The service was actually not wonderful, and a little snooty. I think Earl's really wants to be a high end place.   I want everyone who reads this review to do me a personal favor. If ever you go to Earl's and encounter rudeness, remind them that they are in a mall, and not fine dining. Thank you in advance."}
{"text":"After a recent visit to this restaurant, I decided it was high time for an updated review.   I came here with my cousin on a busy Friday evening and we requested our standard corner booth in the lounge. It was about a 30 minutes to be seated, as there was a long lineup, but it was well worth the wait.   As always, we start off our meals with calamari and red vino. Next we sample the Margherita (another staple), the Bronx burger and chicken Caesar salad. Then came the 'pi√®ce de r√©sistance' at the end of the meal.. Our server mentioned the warm chocolate banana cake feature and the rest is history, folks. It was so moist and delicious, served a la mode. Just thinking about it makes me hungry..  This is definitely the place to be in the 'burbs on the weekend.. It's always super busy and the parking lot is usually packed by 5pm, so come early or make resos.   Eat. Drink. Enjoy. And if they happen to have the banana cake on feature, holla at your girl so I can have some too! Just kidding.. Sort of ;)"}
{"text":"I was here one day last week for lunch and my colleague and I notified our server that we needed to be out fairly quickly. She was very good about serving us promptly, but we did have to get her attention for the bill.   I ordered the burger and the field greens. The field greens were really fresh and the vinaigrette was good. I had asked what temp the burger would be cooked to and my server  said well done. I asked if she could request the kitchen do a medium or medium well instead and she said she'd see what she could do. Unfortunately it appeared that the kitchen wouldn't budge from well done because my burger was subsequently dry. It was flavourful (it reminded me of an upscale A&W burger in flavour profile), but it was dry. That was a shame. It could have been a great burger."}
{"text":"Delicious Jeera Chicken Curry on rice w naan bread. I enjoyed the MILD dinner with plenty of flavour. Food was delivered hot. My friend liked the Santa Fe Chicken salad tho she commented that it was dry this time.  Nice evening to relax on the outdoor patio (tho we listened to 2 sets of emergency vehicles scream by on 16th Ave). Not rushed to order or leave. Yes a fine layer of dust on the tables cuz it's next to such a busy intersection.  Good service. Parking is always a challenge here."}
{"text":"There were a lot of talk about Earl is the hip place to go.  All I can say is EPIC FAIL.    1) Service was slow and I mean S-L-O-W, took the waitress a good 9.5 min to just come by and say Hi.  Then her next words were 'I will be right back'...5 min later.  And it only took 30 min to make me a simple burger...ONLY.  2) The quality of food was horrible.  My meat wasn't cooked properly and the bread tasted like it was made 2 days ago.  McDonald's have done better on their worst day.  3) They tried to pass off corked wine as a 'new' bottle from a 'brand new' case.  When I asked to see the bottle the manager conveniently said they JUST dumped the whole bottle.  Now I have managed a restaurant and I know you don't dump the 'new' bottle of wine if it is bad, you go and get your money back from the supplier.  4) I see everyone already bashed on the deafening decibel level, so I won't go there anymore.  BUT IT WAS WAY TOO F***ING LOUD IN THERE.  5) My beer glass still had someone else's lip imprint on the it and it reeked of dirty week-old dishwashing water.  So let's summarize - bad service, bad food, bad drinks, bad atmosphere.  You are better off saving your money, go on block south to West 50 where the old Dick's were.    ps: 6) WAY over priced for the crap they serve.  Shit on a stick tastes better."}
{"text":"We want with about 16 of us on a Sunday afternoon. It was a bad experience but I understand there was a new manager and things were just getting updated. So I was pleasantly surprised when I complained online and was compd a free meal for along with 2 bottles of wine.  That showed effort so I went back a few more times. But I keep getting disappointed with the food quality and over price ie wine is 4x lcbo. I much prefer to walk a few meters over to moxies or jacks."}
{"text":"Earl's might be a popular chain restaurant out West, but in Toronto it's a popular hot spot for Bay street suits!  I've called each week trying to make a reservation. Apparently, calling on a Tuesday to reserve on a Thursday isn't enough notice!   However, they have tables reserved for walk-ins, you just have to line up... for like, an hour.  #Line up#: Front door to bar It's about a 30 - 45 minute wait during peak periods right after work. But at least they give you free pizza to nibble on and a glass of champagne.  Free drinks +1 star. :D  Once you get to the bar... The bar is packed. Packed, packed, packed...  #Waiting for a table in the dining room#:  Another 30 minutes of waiting. Time for another drink!  The dining room is not as busy and there is ample space that you don't' feel cramped at all.  It was neat that they have an ipad with their most up-to-date wine list. It's fun, I like ipads... and wine!  The prices for wine are good and not that expensive by the bottle, considering how most places really jack up the price. Earl's does have daily drink specials.. Unfortunately, Thursday is some fruity icy sugary grossness.  I ordered: * Prawn dynamite rolls ($11)  - It's a large order of breaded prawn sushi. * Bronx burger ($16) - Tip: Eat the onion rings first * Sticky Toffee pudding ($8) - Gooey, sweet... didn't taste too much like toffee, but I'll still eat and enjoy it!  Service was surprisingly good for such a busy place.  No attitude at all, our waitress was prompt, attentive, and didn't rush us with anything.  She even split the bill properly for shared dishes and wine.  Even though I generally dislike chain restaurants...  I found  myself very pleasantly surprised by Earl's.    Good food, excellent service, and lots of eye candy!  It's loud, fun, and perfect for some after work mayhem."}
{"text":"Terrible. The food is mediocre at best. The waitresses look like bartenders at clubs and the service is practically nonexistent.... So ya pretty much sums up Earls 'nightclub'"}
{"text":"Really nice and cozy spot and the food was amazing ! Had the Santa Fe salad which was absolutely delicious ! Their decor is very chic and trendy - would totally come back here ! Wish they had this in the states"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times over the years, for luncheons and get-togethers with friends. When Earl's is good, it's great, but I find that far too often it's not worth the time to travel up.  I get the feeling that the waitresses in those short skirts are meant to compensate for the overpriced food and the portion sizes you get. The ambience can really go either way. If you're going to come here, I suggest sitting on the patio. Whenever I'm in the restaurant, it's often so noisy that I can't hear myself or others talk.  Food is generally good - I've had some decent burgers and dessert items, but nothing to write home about. The service is good, but I feel like the staff are more busy chatting with each other than are doing their jobs or serving customers. There are several times I've had to put up with long delays while the waitress is busy doing random tasks behind the bar.  Overall, I'd say it's a decent spot if you're just going with friends or want to hang out on the patio, but there are better options out there in terms of quality-versus-price and environment."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during work with coworker. Everything was fabulous. The food, the drinks, the atmosphere, the service, the vibes. Waitress was extremely nice and genuine and it's cool that they offer to split food in half to share if we wanted to share. Never seen restos offer to share meals before! Took away the need for us to feel embarassed and cheap because we want to share different meals haha. I always walk by this place and see the outdoors lounge and it always seemed appealing to me. It was a bit chilly today so we sat indoors, but the vibe is just as nice inside. Chic, modern, classy, upscale without the upscale price tag or attitude. Would def come back"}
{"text":"A group of friends and I went to Earl's recently to chat, though I felt a bit skeptical based on some of the reviews and because the restaurant was located inside Square One (mall-food usually equates to overpriced but mediocre food). The decor is really nice and waitresses were dressed nicely in their little black dresses, giving it a very \"high-class\" feeling, which made me worried that it would be a pretentious restaurant.   However, I found the experience to be favorable overall. Service was friendly, although it took a long time before we could flag down a waitress to take our order and get the bill. Prices were average, maybe a little bit on the pricier side but definitely better than I expected and portions were not tiny at least.   As recommended by a fellow Yelper, the grilled chicken and baked brie sandwich is the way to go! Fusion sushi as an appetizer also looked really good, will try again next time.  I plan to visit again with friends if I get the chance!  Tips:  - You'll feel out of place if you wear t-shirt & jeans, as their main clientele is young, working professionals - If you want to talk, stick with eating in the lounge. The bar area was wayyy too loud from the music/blaring TVs that you're practically shouting..."}
{"text":"One of the few exceptions to a normally great Earl's experience. This one is close to my house so I go here semi-regularly. Everything is just OK, which isn't what I normally expect from an Earl's. Looking forward to it improving."}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday night for happy hour (9-closing). I ordered garlic fries for $3 and my sister had the two taco deal for $7. We came in a large group and the restaurant was quick to accommodate us. As for drinks, it was my first time drinking out in public since the drinking age is 21 in America. The group recommended an Old Fashioned and now I know it's not for me! Haha."}
{"text":"Nice lounge. Friendly staff.  Music a little loud for a classy establishment.  Wood paneling.  Upscale.  Clam chowder was excellent.  Salad was good.  Several tv screens in the lounge.  Great happy hour prices."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere. Pizza is very mediocre and tasteless, desserts are amazing and the best white peach lemonade I had. Customer service was excellent."}
{"text":"The food here is decent for sure, but nothing special. I order take out from time to time and it's hot and fresh, but a little underwhelming for the money. Dining in is a different experience and the service is always fast and friendly, but the food is still only three stars, no matter what way you look at it."}
{"text":"Some great variety of food available here, reflecting the diverse populace of Calgary. Reminds me slightly of places such as Chili's or Friday's, but with better quality food, service, and much more variety. I had the privilege of being treated to lunch last Sunday here by my hosts while visiting town. My friend's grandfather had the fish and chips, and my friend picked a noodle bowl along with a line-up of some rather nice sushi, some sort of roll with a great spice and crunch (of which I don't remember the name of, sadly). My dish was the planked salmon, with a beautiful green curry sauce and served over roasted root veggies. Good moistness, not dry, and with plenty of flavor in the curry that didn't overpower the veggies or fish. Definitely not only a place to get a good lunch, but somewhere to talk over food, take time, relax. Like a neighborhood joint, but only better. I was also told by my friend that some of the locations of Earl's are privately owned (perhaps this one is one of those?). At any rate, because of the limited locations in the U.S. and this location being close to where a dear friend happens to live, I hope that a visit with that friend may bring us to Earl's for another nice time."}
{"text":"The best service we received while traveling in Toronto. Our waitress Alison was super friendly and Professional. Special thanks to the manager Curtis for taking the time and chatting with us. Would definitely come back here the next time we visit Toronto."}
{"text":"I hosted a business brunch for 12 people and the staff at Earls were super helpful, friendly and outstanding in many ways.  The food choices were excellent, the drinks were delicious.  We had a great time and I would happily host at Earls again.  Decor, ambiance, outdoor patio all were stellar."}
{"text":"Earls was great! This was my first time there, it was for my sisters 25th birthday and the staff was amazing. They were very accommodating, and the food was on point, everything we ordered tasted amazing and it never took very long for the orders to come out.  We started with the spinach dip and that was mouth watering, we had finished the bread it came with and we still had more dip so we started dipping our fries! It was just that good and we finished the entire bowl! Yes BOWL! They don't just give you a tiny portion on a small plate! It was perfect cause you definitely crave more!   For our main course I had the chicken Brie and fig sandwich and that tasted amazing as well! The flavors really complement each other well - I liked that the fig wasn't too sweet and over powering and the Apple slices gave it a nice crunch. The garlic aoli was also amazing! Kept spearing more with each bite. I also like that the option for a side can be truffle fires so you don't have to have an extra order! Which means you can try more!   We also had the tofu noodle bowl, and that was also really tasty! The sauce was really good and not too spicy, and the tofu pieces were just the right size so you could get a nice bite with the noodles and peppers.   I really enjoyed my experience at earls. Even though the decor is more high end, you can definitely make it as fancy or causal as you want! It's perfect for just a meal with friends or for special occasions like birthday celebrations."}
{"text":"Been here twice and over all its a high end chain.  They decor is quite nice and gets really busy. The staff at the door and serving are very friendly but it could get a little pricey.   Mediterranean Linguini - had spicy olive oil and san marzano tomato sauce, marinated roasted red peppers, grape tomatoes, olives, parmesan cheese and crumbled feta - The pasta is average   Cajun Blackened Chicken -  had blackening spices, warm potato salad and coleslaw and was quite splendid.   Over all a fancy place to take a date in their dinning area or chill with some friends in the bar area. The washrooms are clean."}
{"text":"Pretty reliable place. Would show up with same girls, order same food, same table tho.....different waiter every time.  Food is good and reasonably priced.  Just drive a small car - I swear the narrowest lots in Calgary are here!"}
{"text":"Earl's isn't bad. Maybe it was the company I was with, but I had a great time at this location in Square One. The sandwiches were delicious, their cocktail drinks were $4 (for some Thursday special) and the s'more dessert was a great finish. They even had Brazilian raspberry Caipirinhas on the cocktail drink list.   A little pricey. But unlike the aggressive rumors I've been hearing that Canada has shitty customer service, I actually thought our server was very sweet and diligent."}
{"text":"The server was pleasant but the food sucked. 3 of our party had the bacon cheeseburger. All of them were cold, over cooked and wayyy too salty. The fries were also cold. Another three of our party had the ahi tuna but they were quite satisfied with their meals. Also the drinks were poor. We had 2 pitchers of margaritas that were tasteless and a couple grapefruit negronis that tasted like burnt oranges. There are too many other choices in the area to bother coming back."}
{"text":"I've driven by this Earls quite a bit since it opened this past year, and decided to check it out before the year was up. I ordered the blackened chicken, it came with a side of warm potato salad, and a coleslaw. The chicken was moist and overall everything tasted very good. My son ordered the bacon cheddar burger, with fries and house gravy. The presentation of the burger was very good. We also ordered a cheese pizza, and a half bowl of Mushroom soup.  I have to agree with other people who say the prices are a little high. My blackened chicken was $21, the burger was $15. pizza $15. And the soup was $7. I noticed that the steaks we're anywhere from $24-$36. Depending on size and cut. I guess on par with other places like the Keg, and Milestones. I have to say that everything that I had today tasted excellent, and I have to say that it was nice to try some familiar flavours that I've been neglecting for a while.   I will definitely be back to this Earls, it was a good treat this afternoon.   If I have to say anything negative about this restaurant,  it's that the floors could've been swept upon opening. It seems they weren't swept or mopped from the previous night. I say this, because we were one of the first table seated for lunch, and you could see the crumbs and food stains on the floor. The afternoon sun was shining down on it. (Otherwise I might not have noticed)."}
{"text":"Your quality of food is gone downhill. Items continue to come out under cooked and cold. Your a restaurant of the past. If you didn't have a patio you be dead to me."}
{"text":"Earls satisfies for a business lunch since they offer a large variety of options on the menu. I've had a few salad bowls and they are great, freshly prepared and big portions too. The Earls clam chowder is tasty and hearty served with a lot of clams. I had the swordfish tacos on my recent visit and they were nicely spiced and goood.  The server we had is attentive and very friendly, she remembered all of our names and our orders and seems to really enjoy her job! :)  One downside is that it's a busy spot and so quite loud to have a business lunch /meeting. Also, they are super popular and so a reservation is a must."}
{"text":"I used to go here often for lunch as the staff are super friendly and the atmosphere is great. However the food has really fallen off. One meal, the waitress brought out my food and then told me they had run out of one of the main ingredients in the dish...i wish she told me before they brought it out..I ate it anyways and they compensated me with an extra side.  Regardless,  the last few times I have been, the food has been sloppy, greasy and just didn't make me feel great after the meal. On the plus side, if you're not hungry it's decent for a couple of drinks and the patio is good during the summer."}
{"text":"I was treated to a meal here recently. My companion and I both had steak. It was cooked perfectly and tasty. The sides were delicious as well. I opted for fries. The service was attentive, friendly and informative. What I did not like was the loud music. Carrying a conversation was not easy. There is not reason for it to be that loud. The prices were a bit high. Overall it was okay."}
{"text":"I have been to Earls a couple of times before but always for drinks and an app or two, and it was pretty good. Today my husband and I had dinner and I can't say that I was very impressed.  I'd like to start with the positives of the night though first, the decor and the ambiance is great, very nice lighting and not too dark. My husband had the Louisiana chicken sandwich, which he really enjoyed and said the flavours were very balanced! I'm a vegetarian and I can't say I loved the options, but that's more of an opinion, I had soup & salad.  Both were from a feature menu, Tortilla soup and a Mexican type salad as well. The soup was amazing (a bit spicy) but I love spice! The flavours worked really well together and the portion was decent.  A few things had made our night not as great as it could have been, the salad I had needed seasoning very badly, I didn't eat any of it and I wasn't asked the reasoning or anything. The second things was dessert, we got coconut cream pie and it was a disaster! The cream was split, they had lime grated on top which didn't work and the custard was a bit too sweet. They did take it off the bill but I would never have served it in the first place, a cook should know the difference.  Lastly I just didn't find anything special about this place at all, not a great menu, decent service, not a place I would want to bring anyone to or rave about."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks on a Friday night.  The space was packed but my friends and I were able to get a seat at the bar.  We were served by a young waitress.  She didn't bring us any menus.  We were going to eat so we asked for food menus, she came back with only 1 for 4 of us to share?!  We ordered a pitcher of beer and watched as our waitress constantly ignored us to flirt and attentively care for other patrons.    We didn't order food as she never came back to take our orders and we decided to leave.  As we were paying there was a small dispute about who would pay (as per any group of friends) we literally were handing her a debit card and she just walked away again! Didn't want to waste her time at all even to finish our transaction.    We were all positive that because we weren't wearing business wear and suits that we were getting improper service, seriously is that what it takes be treated kindly? We spoke to the manager, Jasmine ( I think that was her name) who was extremely apologetic.  She seemed to be upset about our statement that we were treated like second class citizens because of our informal attire.  She gave us a $50 gift card which was amazing but our night was already ruined because of the imconpitant waitress."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday celebration. I tried getting reservations last year for Saturday night and they said no.. so I looked elsewhere. I tried this year again and they were taking reservations (yay!). We were about 10 people in total.   We were seated very promptly and given the menu. Everything on the menu looked great! I loved the vibe of the restaurant!   5 people out of the 10 in our group ordered burgers and said they were amazing! Especially the one with the onion rings! I ordered: Lois Lake Oceanwise Steelhead Salmon - $23.75 (feta caper aioli, brown basmati rice and seasonal vegetables) - LOVED THIS, except the seasonal veggies (I got brussel sprouts or beans option - I chose brussel sprouts lol).   A couple others ordered chicken fettuccini, margarita pizza and tacos - good reviews for all.   Our server was lovely! She chatted with us for a bit and wasn't pushy about us leaving. We were served very quickly and were done our dinner in an hr and 15 mintues (!!!)  I'll definitely be returning on a much sunnier afternoon to have brunch/lunch on the patio. :)"}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place has three stars. I've been here twice and the food is pretty good. IMO there's only a handful good restaurants & food spots in Mississauga and this is one of them. Can't say much about other dishes but the tacos are AMAZING. They're so freaking good and I've been to several highly praised taco shops in California - I like Earls better than many of those. Can't say if like the chicken or fish tacos more. They're quite spicy though and I like spicy food. I couldn't handle their Korean chicken wings, they were just too spicy but the flavor was on point. Love their garlic fries too. The service was alright, can get noisy and usually has a 15 min wait on weekends."}
{"text":"Good food and good drinks however service isn't always great. I found plastic in my drink once and the server still left it on the bill."}
{"text":"I was going to meet my boyfriend and another good guy friend here for lunch. I knew the conversations were going to be hilarious, and going to Earl's? I have always wanted to try so I was excited! I have always passed by this place, and the patio always seems packed. SO! We went to Earl's around 2:30-ish during the Canada Day long weekend (Saturday) and I could see some empty tables.   I asked my bf to RUN to the entrance and ask for the most sunniest spot outside. No Shade. No Umbrella. SUNNNNN!  We managed to get a table and I quickly hiked up my skirt:D Even tans, of course. The menu is your basic salads, burgers, fries, etc... My bf decided to get some mega burger with a beef patty and fried onion wings wedged between two big butter buns. OMG! ARTERIES BEWARE! I opted for their Lobster Roll. I found this to lovely and refreshing; Cool, lobster meat between an extremely buttery, brioche - like bun.   What is a patio without drinks? I had three glasses of wine...yum.  My only dismay about the patio is that, due to the tall buildings surrounding the restaurant, the sun is quickly blocked. You have to time yourselves perfectly because the sun's location is between these two tall buildings - right when it's in the middle, it's glorious!  The ambiance is nice and I could see why this place is always so busy."}
{"text":"I had no clue such a restaurant existed until I saw their sign at square one so I had no preconceived ideas as far as my expectations went. I decided to get the burger because I've practically tasted all the burgers in square one and this is what was missing on my list.  A bit pricey compared to the other options in the mall and sadly, it was one of the worst burgers I've had. Knowing what the prices were didn't help and so did the fries. It was dry and thin, the bread was so so and took so long to arrive at my table, and this was at 3pm which is hardly peak hours. I left the place never to return ever again."}
{"text":"Earl's is fantastic. Their drinks, appetizers and service create a wonderful dining experience.   The food here is very good based on my experience. They have all the common dishes every other good restaurant has - Pizzas, pastas, fish, chicken, ribs and of course burgers. They also have some Asian inspired dishes that might seem a bit out of place on the menu, but are also well worth trying.  They have a great selection of wine and a number of beers on draught as well. Great spot to grab a beer and watch the game at the bar.   The space inside is huge and the ambiance is pretty relaxed. Outside boasts a pretty large enclosed patio with umbrellas, heaters and planters for some privacy.  For some reason, I always tend to judge restaurants by their washrooms...  (I hope I'm not the only who does). Anyways, really fancy washrooms with built-in TV screens in the mirror. How cool is that?  Overall, I think Earl's is a nice restaurant for any occasion - date, friends or family."}
{"text":"Honestly not sure why the reviews are so low! I've been here once before for happy hour and after hearing about their \"Brunch Happy Hour\" from open to noon on the weekend, I was excited to visit again. Basically all their brunch entrees are $8 including eggs benny, avocado toast, etc. It was a really great deal and the portions were big. I love brunch but I don't always love the wait and the price points at other restaurants. I wasn't expecting a lot but I was impressed!  I ordered the Chorizo & Mushroom hash which came with some avocado, topped with 2 soft poached eggs and a generous helping of hollandaise sauce. In terms of hollandaise it's a bit on the tangier side. Definitely a very rich dish, and very yummy! A friend of mine had the \"Super Avocado Brunch\" and enjoyed it as well. They have plenty of seating and are conveniently located across the street from The Core."}
{"text":"Slow clap for the service at this place. Never have had better service at any Earls. Whoever is hiring staff is doing a solid job.   Sarah was accommodating, attentive and a pleasure to deal with. She provided accurate suggestions and recommendations when I had questions about the menu. Sarah was always checking in to make sure we were golden even if she was just passing by. All drinks and food came to our table quickly and hot/cold depending on the item.   The kitchen was great, our food was exactly what we ordered and was fast. I highly recommend the shrimp and garlic fries.   The happy hour promotions are off the charts, I mean half of there appetizers are on sale in some way.   Further, the management truly cares about customers experience at their restaurant. Half way through the night a manager, Clair, stopped by and asked how things were and made sure our evening was perfect. She did this with every table on the bar side I could see. Kudos Clair for being visible and keeping customers happy.   To summarize, I cannot wait to go back and will ask o he placed in Sarah's section.  Don't bother going to Cactus Club, don't waste your time at Joey's. Head over to Earls when you are in the northeast Calgary area. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great lunch patio if you can get a seat. I had the Bronx burger (about $15) and a pint ( or 2 , well, 3) of the albino Rhino ale. Delicious. Burger is HUGE and messy but very good. As everyone else points out the waitresses are hired for a specific reason here, and it's not just customer service skills. ( although they carry out that part of their duties well enough!).  Bar is packed in the evening with Bay st crowd."}
{"text":"Came to Earls for a business lunch.   Very busy place, come early if you want to sit on the patio.   Seated right away. Served right away. Very efficient, everyone is extremely nice.   Had the steak. Was a decent size.  Well seasoned, cooked perfect.   Great place to meet for a quick bit or  hang out and watch the downtown activities."}
{"text":"The bellini I ordered was a great price and actually quite delicious.  The service was awkward from the hostess to the bill payment. Not rude or anything, just awkward."}
{"text":"Food was average, nothing to rave about. Don't find value in what you pay for what you get. View is nice."}
{"text":"20:45 hostess was very polite and informative about delays but people leaving and tables to be cleared.   Been here for about 10 minutes waiting for a table in the patio. Currently we are 4th in line. There have been 10 tables waiting to be cleared for the past 15 minutes and no service in site. Lots of serving and hostess staff milling around but no one bussing tables.  20:53 count is down to 9.  20:04 we are in and still the same 6 tables not cleaned  Men's room had not been tended to.  Garbages full, sinks a mess and no towels to dry hands.   20:10 got a table and the hostess brought water.  Shortly we placed a drink order with our server.   20:19 still no drink or waitress to take food order. 2 clean tables, 6 still waiting and customers still waiting for sitting.   20:23 Left disappointed with the lack of service and went down the street for food and drink  I'm sure the food would have been fine but for an establishment that is moving to a fixed tip added to the bill they would really work on the basics of restaurant service."}
{"text":"came here for a quick bite during our lunch break, also to celebrate some good news.  mimosa were on point, ordered a pizza and added mushrooms - it was good too.  didn't really have a server come around much which was nice in this case because I was enjoying my conversation with my girlfriend.   we said we needed to leave by a certain time and we were out. appreciated that!"}
{"text":"extremely disappointed - came here a year later to give this location another chance, and its disappointing to feel nothing has changed.  We were seated, and given menu's and pretty much forgotten about. We saw a server walking by and we asked for water - she brought that and never came back to ask us what we wanted to order, and even if she wasn't serving us, she could have told whoever was supposed to, to help.  We were here around 1:45pm so it wasn't busy at all.  We saw a man nicely dressed walking by who was placing utensils at the table nearby and we asked him if we could order with him - he was nice enough to take our order.  Our food came out, but no server to ask us if we wanted any fresh ground pepper and or extra cheese.  Someone came by to pick up our plates but never were we asked if we wanted dessert or anything else (ie: a coffee).  We had to walk to the bar, wait until someone saw us and then we had to ask to pay for the bill - no apology from any of the staff there for leaving us unattended. Sad to say the samething happend to me a year ago. I will not return to this location."}
{"text":"Earl's is definitely an upscale apres-work watering hole (as aptly stolen from How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days). If you're looking for good food (a little pricey), and a gaggle of financial district types, this is the place.  When we first arrived, there was no way we were getting a table - but then a very friendly waitress spotted us and said a table was just cleared. Lucky me, and Melissa D., snagged a spot. Generally speaking, if you're heading there after work any day of the week, be prepared to stand.   Service was quick, and the drinks were delish. Tuesdays are bellini night, and we enjoyed a few white peach bellinis for only $4.50 and a tasty spinach & feta dip to share. Served with unlimited crostinis, it was the perfect dish to accompany our much needed beverages. For a more hearty meal, they have sharing platters like baby calamari, salmon and tuna rolls, grilled tacos, edamame, and chicken tenders (just to name a few). The burgers also seem to be popular (ranging from $12-$15).  People seemed to be enjoying whole meals, and not just drinks, so there seemed to be something for everyone.  The service was the most impressive part of the evening - everyone was overly accommodating, and eager to please. Even though it was busy, our server was attentive and chatty!  The decor is pretty cool - take note of the single lightbulbs hanging from the ceiling. Great ambience and energy, but it's definitely for a suit-wearing crowd, and people willing to stand while sipping drinks. Really great people watching too...if you're into that sort of thing..."}
{"text":"I made a reservation on a Saturday about an hour before arriving.  When I arrived - they got me seated right away - YAY! $7 Mojito (2 oz) drink special on a Saturday - YAY! Running out of pasta and after ordering quinoa in a dish - BOO! Taking an hour to get our food - BOO! Attentive waitress - YAY! Removing charges for one main and all appies - YAY! Food portions reasonable, prices - OK, Food quality - above average.  During the wait chatting with friends and free wifi helped! This would have been a two star experience - but the waitress handled this very well.  If they had the food and were faster 4 star."}
{"text":"The outside patio is always busy and filled with people from the financial district after work. We have on several occasions been able to get a seat out there on a Thursday or Friday night.   The appetizers are tasty, especially the sushi roll and the crispy shrimps.  Service has been good even though the friendly waitresses are kept busy running around filling drink orders.   There is an energetic vibe that makes this a great place to hang out with a group of friends after work and late into the evening."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times for drinks, but haven't actually sat down for a meal in a long time.  The place is always busy with it's prime location in the financial district and it's collection of pretty servers with short black skirts that act as eye candy to the line up of wealthy Bay street workers constantly trying to flirt with the servers.   As for the food itself: Lobster and Prawn Roll - Not very good, bread wasn't tasty and the mix of prawn didn't go well with the lobster bits.    Side of Clam Chowder - Not bad, it wasn't too creamy or water like most restuarants serve it, keeping a nice brothy texture to it. However, in my opinion there was too much unnecearry added ingredients overpowered the clam, which is suppose to be the star of the dish."}
{"text":"Not a consistent quality. Tried burger two different times and got two quite different tastes. Nice patio in the back though"}
{"text":"Once again Earls pulls off another excellent experience! Wings on Wednesday 6.50 and pints of their Rhino Ale for 5 dollars. Fresh food and excellent service on the Patio from server Dakota.  I also recommend the desert call \"gold digger\"."}
{"text":"Ate here once a few years ago after work one day with friends, and remember liking the food and loving their huge patio.  But moved away from Toronto a couple of years ago and only got back to it again around 3pm on Christmas Eve with a friend.  Needless to say, they were probably getting ready to close at 4 or 5 o'clock, so the place was mostly empty.  It's quite large inside, very modern, with contemporary lighting, d√©cor, lots of tables & booths.  We took a booth by the bar on the left hand side and were served quickly.  Overall very friendly.  I tried the Hunan Kung Pao for my entr√©e (ginger soy sauce, wok fried vegetables and noodles, roasted peanuts.  14.00 with added tofu for an extra $3.00).  I requested spicy so they put three chillies in the bowl, but they were whole and dried, so I had to use my knife to cut them open and disperse the seeds throughout the bowl to achieve any spiciness.  Very tasty but still not that hot.  My friend tried a starter with chicken in it but I regret taking note of the name of the dish and definitely don't see it on their online menu, but she enjoyed thoroughly.  The Sticky Toffee Chocolate Pudding for dessert was melt-in-your-mouth amazing (housemade warm chocolate cake drizzled with rich chocolate and toffee sauce served with a scoop of vanilla gelato in a sugar candy basket).  Definitely big enough to share, which we did.  The frozen white peach bellini hit the spot.  I would go back here anytime."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite restaurants in square one! I have been going regularly for years now!   Let's start with the ambience and environment: I love that they usually have a young-adult crowd (low 20s- mid 30s) Which makes it a nice place to catch up with friends or have a girls night out.   Their menu and food choices are good. I usually get a Salad which always has a creative twist.   But my absolute favorite thing on their menu and the reason I keep coming back is their dessert. The sticky toffee chocolate pudding is my absolute favorite and is to die for!! It's a must!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. Ceasar salad with grilled chicken $16.25. Salmon filet $24. Service was good. Atmosphere was good too. I asked for a booth at quiet corner so we could talk without yelling. Ceasar salad a bit too creamy, I would ask for less dressing next time, if possible. Portion was large. Reasonable price for downtown."}
{"text":"Great financial district after work hang out. They have some good deals on particular nights. I love their salt and pepper chicken wings on Wednesdays and so does everyone else so get there earlier if you want to try these scrumptious morsels. On Tuesdays, you can get a half priced bottle of wine, perfect for a celebration. In warmer weather, the patio is very popular and friendly for meeting people."}
{"text":"Pretentious. Superficial. Rude. Ignorant. Arrogant. And Careless.  Only a few of the words to explain my recent experience at this Earls.  I truly was expecting better from this Stephen Avenue hot spot, but I can guarantee that I will never step foot in here again.  The servers were rude, the staff lead was extremely snobby, and after having left several messages for the restaurant manager and him not calling me back, I have nothing but disgust for this restaurant.  No redeeming qualities about it and the fact that the people in charge treated me with such disrespect and did not even have the COURTESY to return my messages speaks for itself.  I wouldn't suggest you make this place a part of your evening out. You are bound to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food. Love the atmosphere and the pleasantness of the wait staff. We came mid day and were quickly seated. Would recommend it as a stop any time your near square one!"}
{"text":"Such a great patio but can't deliver hot food.  \"The kitchen is slammed \" is not a reason to serve cold food. It's a Friday night and the sun is out, there should be no surprise that the restaurant will be full.   Every dish that came out was cold.  This  reoccurring arrogance of Earls Willowpark is tiring. Just be better..... you're Earls!"}
{"text":"The ambiance of this restaurant is just splendid.  We ordered the calamari and prawns avocado toast as appetizers. Absolutely loved both of them.10/10 For my entree I got Cajun salmon with seasonal veggies The salmons was perfectly cooked and very flavourful. The beans were horrible I substituted the rice for more veggies and I thought they would bring me a medley of veggies and instead they just brought me green beans which were so undercooked. I told the wait staff so they asked if I wanted to replace it with something else and I did not.  They ended up not charging me for the beans and one appetizer. The service was spectacular so I'll be going back."}
{"text":"While visiting Toronto, I ate at Earl's two nights in a row with a couple friends, both who had previously dined here before. This was my first time, and I'm officially a fan! We walked in on a Wednesday night, and the space was filled with multiple patrons who looked as if they just got off work. We were able to choose our own high-top table along the wall. The first night I ordered the Bacon & Cheddar Burger with garlic fries; both were amazing! I pretty much polished off the fries before even taking a bite of my burger. They were so golden and crispy, and the garlic with the Parmesan dipping sauce enhanced the flavor significantly. The burger was flavorful and perfectly cooked, I never even asked for a specific way which is usually 'well done' for me. I also ordered the Red Sangria, it was impeccable and a perfect complement to my meal.  The second night, I ordered the Cajun Oven Roasted Salmon, and my goodness! As I delicately sliced the salmon into even pieces, it literally just felt apart. Not to mention, the flavor was out of this world! Unfortunately, I wasn't too fond of the less flavorful rice and squash, but the salmon more than made up for them. There was a $7.00 (CAN) on Frozen Bellinis so I ordered two those of those as well, and they were absolutely delicious. Might I add that there was a DJ this night!   I cannot wait to return to Earl's to try more entrees on the menu particularly the steak and steak frites! Dining at Earl's is much more than just dining, it's an experience with great service and food."}
{"text":"The menu was great, my Jerusalem Salad delicious and our server, Holly, excellent.  We will definitely be back next time we are in Calgary."}
{"text":"We come here often because of the solid drink specials and great atmosphere. We sit in the lounge and usually order entres that could also be ordered at any neighbourhood pub. The service is exactly what it should be and nothing more. This location along with the Westhills location is far superior to Earl's on Stephens Ave."}
{"text":"I like the bar, decor, and style of the restaurant. Manager on duty today for lunch was absolutely delightful. She sold me on the lobster roll.  Our waitress was not nearly as charming and the lobster roll was good not great."}
{"text":"A girlfriend and I wanted the perfect lunch spot to catch up after not having been in the same country for the last 6 years. We decided to meet at Earls in Dalhousie Station, because it USED to be one of our mutual favourites. Used to be.  It's one thing to be served, and it's another to be harassed. Three different servers came by our table about every five minutes until we ordered. When we did finally order, the servers continued to come by every couple minutes to see if everything was okay. Believe it or not, there IS such thing as 'over-serving', especially when two people are trying to have a conversation.  I wasn't impressed to see that they had taken my favourite dish (Thai Noodle Salad) off the menu, and even less impressed when my 12 dollar salad was served as a plateful of greens with a few measely berries on top.  It's pretty safe to say you wont be catching me at this location ever again."}
{"text":"I never come to this Earl's but was meeting a friend for drinks and a bite. She picked it since it was close for her. When I arrived it was busy, not crazy busy but busy at the hostess stand. It was well after dinner, so I was happy to miss the dinner rush. I waited to just ask the hostess a question since my friend was already there and seated. Just needed to know where she was? I waited as the hostess talked to some guys. I am assuming they were waiting for a table however they were talking about hockey, baseball and everything else under the sun. The polite thing would have been for the hostess to ask how she can help me, but no she kept talking with these boys instead and completely ignored me. After a few minutes of patiently waiting and feeling like I am interrupting this very important conversation on sports, texted my friend and asked where she was seated. I walked in and followed the directions from my friend. At that point, the hostess finally had some interest in me as she angrily asked me \"where are you going\"? I advised her my friend was already here and I am going to the table and walked off. She mumbled something about me being rude and it did give me a giggle since, isn't this the person who just ignored me the last 10 minutes while she flirted away with a group of boys?  Arrived at the table my friend was waiting at and she looked annoyed. Found out she had already been there for 20 minutes and no one even took her drink order. We waited a few more minutes and flagged someone down to find out where our waitress was? We were advised, she would be with us shortly? Waited...waited and waited and decided to just leave. At this point, if its this hard to get a drink who knows how hard it would be to eat something?  EARLS - FAIL  Everything is just meh, which isn't what I normally expect from an Earl's. I prefer Earl's Tin Palace on every front since everything is top notch. This location is just meh. Nothing spectacular, good or great. Looking forward to it improving allot. If it does, may give them another chance."}
{"text":"Food Quality - Great Menu Design - Great - regularly changing Service - Good, consistent Decor - Great Location - Great Price - Fair  This location over their other Ontario ones - the others seem like a different (subpar) concept entirely.   It outdoes its nearby brother, Joeys due to it's menu design."}
{"text":"Nice renovation!  We used to come to this location often, as we live in the area. After the terrible flood it underwent major renovation. I like it, but think the old style was even nicer.  During my last visit I had a bad experience that turned into a good one.  I had lunch with a friend and ordered a Vodka Tonic. I was sure they were going to bring either Canada Dry Tonic water or maybe Schweppes.  To my surprise the waitress brought a funny looking tiny bottle that said tonic something. I was busy talking to my friend and did not pay much attention to it.  When I finally  had a sip I almost threw up! It tasted like cough syrup or worse. I called the waitress and asked what was wrong with my drink? She did not know.  I looked closer at the little bottle and it was some kind of 'fancy' herb infused tonic. I said I wanted just plain one. To my surprise she said the bar did not carry that. I was appalled and returned/  cancelled the drink. A few minutes later the manager came with a new vodka tonic. They actually crossed the street over to Shopper's Drugmart to get my plain tonic water - which was really nice I thought. Great way to keep a customer satisfied.  The food was really good as always.  So my only suggestion: Please have some good ol' Canada Dry.  You don't want to get Vanilla Coke when you order a rum & coke either....."}
{"text":"Good service, ok food, not the best and have had worse. It's Earls. Even with the magnetic fancy menu, dim lighting and the all black server uniforms, it's just Earls. Meh. 2 sodas 1 starter 1 expensive burger 1 more starter (wife's choice) 1 desert 1 tip $60 something"}
{"text":"APPETIZERS - Tuna Poke - albacore tuna, mango, avocado, spicy lime dressing, macadamia nuts - Sicilian Calamari - tomatoes, cucumber, olives, herb salad, greek citrus yogurt, gluten aware flour  I liked the calamari more than the Tuna Poke because of the portions of seafood. The tuna poke, though good, didn't have lots of tuna in it.  MAINS - Chimichurri Skirt Steak - marinated in tamarind, cumin, garlic and coriander, smoky poblano chimichurri sauce, baby potatoes, pan roasted tomatoes - Full BBQ Ribs + Cajun Chicken - with warm potato salad, coleslaw - New York Striploin - Lois Lake Steelhead Salmon - feta, caper and dill aioli, jasmine rice and seasonal vegetable  Loved the Chimichurri Steak as the chimichurri was really good and steak was made correctly. My fav was the ribs as it was fall of the bone tender. The Striploin was a bit salty for me though it was made well. The salmon was unremarkable.   DRINKS - Old Fashioned - maker's mark bourbon, demerara sugar and rootbeer bitters - Whiskey Sour - george dickel whiskey, bitter orange marmalade, fresh lemon juice + meringue foam - Pandemonium - appleton white and vx rums, falernum, guava, orange and fresh lime  Though the Pandemonium looked cool in the tiki mug, I actually found it too sweet to my liking. My favorite is the Old Fashioned as it was strong with just the right amount of sugar and bitters.   OVERALL If they can maintain the food quality and service consistently, it will be a great place to hang out!"}
{"text":"The Bronx Burger is to die for. We all kept asking how we were going to eat it-- answer, with your mouth. Perfectly seasoned meat, onion rings and white cheddar on top, omg. So good. Fun atmosphere. Our server was excellent too! The back of the menus are super fun too! I witnessed myself and a couple other patrons steal theirs!"}
{"text":"Oh Yeah! Earls the famous spot for getting your imported Alberta Beef along with attractive wait staff all dressed in black. Well that's the hype anyway, but what they lived up to is a steak house experience without the spendy snooty pretense. I had the steak with peppercorn sauce along with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus tips and it was excellent. Well proportioned and perfectly cooked as you would expect from an Albertan restaurant like this. And of course I ordered a Caesar for the full Albertan experience and it was divine. There is an unwritten rule that a classic drink like this needs a memorable twist to set it apart from others you've had recently and this time it was a slightly twisted stick of beef jerky as a swizzle stick which was remarkable tasty. It's in the details folks. And the dessert was fabulous too. Served on a dinner plate, these are a meal in itself so be prepared, it's just like going to grandma's house. Eat up!"}
{"text":"Great after work hangout place, especially in the summer. My favourite seating is by the open fireplace at the back of the outdoor patio. The skyscrapers, twinkling patio lights and surrounding greenery really set a chill ambience. They have pretty good drink specials most nights. Service can be a bit slow during peak periods. Food is average but portions are good.   Overall great place for drinks and a few bites."}
{"text":"Earl's is another legit west coast chain taking T.O. by storm -- show the shitty franchises here how it is done!  The food is delicious - my personal favourite is the Blackened Chicken when I'm hungry, as it is filling and tasty. Their burgers and sandwiches are money too. They have a good selection of tap beer - one of the few places that serves Kokanee on tap!  They have a wicked patio, but to enjoy one of those for lunch, need to get there before 11:30am to book a table (send a junior from the office to hold down the spot, guarantee he would love it -- I've done it :D )  As you would expect from any downtown resto, there is enough eye candy around. The service is friendly, but because they are busy and I'm an impatient \"\"ck, I find them to be slow. However, they are super nice lol"}
{"text":"To anyone from the west coast, Earls is just another one of our chain restaurants that's been around awhile, looks upscale, serves reliable food items, and generally features attractive servers. In Toronto, Earls is about a year old, and is literally the hottest place to be after work.  During lunch it is unbelievably busy.  We had to use a boss' name (a regular at Earls) just to get a table indoors for lunch, otherwise it's impossible.  As a Vancouverite, I am totally dumbfounded by the popularity of this place.  The Keg has been unseated as the #1 after work patio spot to hit for the Bay Street crowd.  Both have awesome, huge patio places.  If you're a Bay Street yuppie, or you're looking to meet one, there is no better place to hit than Earls.  If that isn't your thing, it still has decent food, good service, reasonable prices, and nice surroundings.  But you can find better."}
{"text":"I was in town for business and an associate recommended this place to me to try out. It was a cold and rainy evening in Toronto, but the hostesses took care of us from the moment that we arrived. Free taste of champagne was a nice touch. There was a small wait, but once we were seated, the waitress made us feel like we were her only table (well not quite, but close). The food was warm, the drinks were promptly delivered, and the ambiance was wonderful. I have now placed this place as a \"To go to in Canada\" I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Usually not a fan of chain places and this sort of fit the bill.   We had the artichoke spinach dip and fish tacos. Both were very good. The bellinis were exceptionally good and only $5 each. Very smooth with great flavour.  I don't think it's going to be a regular place for me in terms of food but it would be worth the trip just for the Bellini special for sure."}
{"text":"Terrible restaurant. Ruined a bday party by screwing up the reservation. We had to wait more than an hour to get seated and another hour+ wait just to get our bill. Staff were unapologetic..and we weren't looking for comps but it would have been nice given the fact that they literally ruined the night with their terrible service."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place out of all the restaurants in that location.10 out of 10 on the atmosphere.....only ordered burgers during my three visits there,but seeing the other food rolling out looks pretty good.Very crowded,looks like a big place but very limited seating especially when the patio is not opened. Like the fact it is pricey to keep the movie rats out lol."}
{"text":"Earl's is a decent chain that I would rate above the usual Milestone's/Moxie's-type places but below Joey, which is owned by the same company. The ambiance is nice -- they have huge stone pillars, massive airy rooms, a large patio, great seating, and tasteful decor. There's a decent number of beers on tap -- and they have their own house beer, which is respectable -- and the service is great.   The food is pretty average. In my most recent trip I had the Bronx burger, which was decent but nothing to write home about. Compared to Joey's menu, which I love, I just don't think Earl's is as good.   Also, if you don't work in finance, you might find this place a little off-putting. It's all douchey guys in suits hitting on gals in tight dresses. I prefer to eat in places with a greater mix of people."}
{"text":"Earl's is Earl's. Good looking waitresses, good food and TV's all over the place.   They should figure out how to play more than just one channel/game across their multiple TV's. They were accommodating in putting the hockey game we wanted on, but we were really just lucky there wasn't a Calgary game on, otherwise their multiple TV's would have been useless!  I look forward to visiting an Earl's in Ottawa one day."}
{"text":"I must admit, after visiting Earl's twice this past week, I'm a big fan. The restaurant looks great, very modern and laid back. The food is better than other chain establishments in the area. Some food highlights:  - The dynamite Prawn and Mango roll appears to be their signature appetizer and I can see why - great flavor combinations.  - Blackened Chicken is excellent. Easily the best chicken I ever ate, so juicy and the blackened spice really enhanced the flavor. The dish is served with potatoes & sour cream and coleslaw which were both really good as well.  - A few friends tried the linguine with dungeness crab and loved it. I thought the portion looked a little small but tasted great.  - Some decent beer selections on tap (about 20 beers) and some interesting cocktails.   The place has a nice patio but couldn't get a seat on both visits. Service was good and friendly. Prices are good given the location and food quality -  about $20 per dish on average but range from $12 - $38 for entrees.  I will be back..."}
{"text":"Earls moving out east with the same hiring practice, The menu is very simuliar to the menu back home. I had the New York Striplion grilled to my medium rare. The service was good but not to the same level as Cactus Club."}
{"text":"Same-old Earls, completely average food and service at a price-point higher than it should be.  Not sure if it's really somewhere I need to revisit.  BTW, \"sticky toffee pudding\" isn't just chocolate cake topped with caramel sauce.  This on the heels of my super-greasy fish and chips (served without tartar sauce?) helped put us off."}
{"text":"This place is here for convenience.  Its located inside a mall with high people traffic.  It has decent ambience but food is not upto par at all.  It looks fancy but doesnt do anything for taste.   If you want to meet in that area there are plenty of other places.  Do your yelping!!"}
{"text":"I've never had a great meal at any of the earls. This location was the most disappointing.  Everytime I walk into this location I immediately walk back out.   There's ways a weird smell in there. So this one time my friend made me go there.... They seem to be unorganized in there. It took a while for them find us and take the drink order.   I like that it's spacious and they have many television screens.  Food: came out quickly.  The blacked chicken was dry and generic. The salmon was good didn't go with the rice.     Earls, this one or any other is best for grabbing drinks and watching a game. Otherwise keep it moving because the meal isn't going to be spectacular ...."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch with my daughter her, service was incredibly slow we each had time to go to the washroom and wait another 5 minutes before our drink order was taken, so we ordered the food as well. I had the salad soup combo, the green salad was lovely the soup ok and the sourdough bread was tough and slathered in olive oil, not appealing. She had the fettuccine Alfredo, the noodles were under cooked but couldn't find our waitress to flag down, she came once during the meal at the beginning.   Wouldn't go back, there was a managers meeting or something going on, regretting not saying something while they were all sitting there.  But they got good service Pet peeve, put the damn pepper on the table, I haven't even tried it yet and your asking me, how do I know if I need pepper."}
{"text":"This place is good to acceptable. It came as a recommendation from an out of town friend as a nice place to have dinner. The food seems to attempt to be unique, however it ends up being more \"mass produced\" than special.  The atmosphere is very cool modern with both suits and newborns. While I'm just visiting here, I probably would recommend somewhere else for a nice dinner due to the plethora of awesome restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"Earls used to be good, but now they're just terrible all around. The last while that I was going there, the beer tasted sour like it was sitting in the lines all day. This has happened on a handful of occasions.  The food presentation has become non existent. The Cajun chicken sandwich that I used to enjoy was presented on a shrivelled dried out bun - it looked like one of those McDonald's burgers that's been left out for weeks to show that it doesn't decompose.   It was so off putting that I had to send it back. 10 minutes later, they brought another sandwich that looked almost as bad, but since I don't like causing a ruckus, I just ate it anyways. My guests were thinking the same thing. They didn't want to eat it either.  I've noticed a steady decline on food quality as well as a boring menu. If earls spent as much time giving a shit about their food as they did on hiring beautiful waitresses, maybe the establishment would still be worth going to. I'd rather go to Joey's any day over Earls. You guys should take notes from them!"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed in the young hostess and serving staff. Went in for my brother's birthday and when we asked for a table the hostess' told us to sit in the waiting area while we waited for a table. Keep in mind the waiting area is right beside, within arms reach, the hostess stand. And although this incident happened a few months ago, I have not been able to forget this. The group of hostesses said, \"I don't know who I should put these people with, no one wants any tables. Everyone's in a bad mood today.\" Well, you can imagine that made us feel super welcome. Sike. Right away we knew our server was going to either be super fake or really short with us. Anyways, when they finally found us a table after approaching all of their servers. They seated us and when we began to order, we mentioned that my brother had an egg allergy so he could not have anything with eggs in it. Low and behold after a long wait for our food, he had coleslaw on his plate. When we kindly and politely mentioned it to the person who brought it to us, she rudely replied, \"well did you tell your server?!\" And we said yes. Then without saying anything she just left. Our server came over and was again quite short with us, to the point where I didn't even wanna friggin deal with her anymore so my brother and I just switched dinners. They didn't provide any compensation or sincere apologies. Hopefully, they can work on their professionalism even in the presence of a busy night."}
{"text":"Earl's King Street is great. Love the wait staff, the ambiance and the food is great!  The spinach dip thing with the bread? I could eat that all day...  But the reason I came here? I wanted a steak. Specifically, a steak that wasn't sirloin. They had my favourite cut! Bone-in Ribeye! On my first visit I asked for it cooked medium-well and blackened. Incredible.  However, on my second visit, I ordered the same steak, and got a Ribeye with no bone... That's the best part!!! I was pretty let down by that. But, the gelato dessert kinda made me feel better. I should have notified the server about my steak faux-pas, but, meh.  I thought about giving 4 or 5 stars, but that missing bone is pretty unforgivable. I'll have to give 2 stars for that. But I'll revisit my review on my next visit and hopefully it was just a one-time error."}
{"text":"I went here for my brother in law's bday last Friday. We selected Earl's because they now serve hormone and antibiotic free meat. In fact the reason this isn't a 1 star review is because of that redeeming quality.   While the meat at Earl's is healthier than what one would get at any other chain restaraunt, the sad truth is its not very good tasting beef. My steak was inedible. The burger I had instead was passable due to the thick brioche bun and a lot of ketchup.  The service was awful. We had a good looking server who basically didn't care about serving us. Dirty appetizer dishes remained on the table until after the entrees came out. Water glasses were filled twice during our meal. When we paid him he told us it was his last week there. Perhaps the other servers are better...  Of the appetizers we had the one I liked was the spinach dip. It was nothing special but it was creamy and cheesy. Tasty in a very generic way.  The calamari was a large portion.   I don't think I will return to this Earl's."}
{"text":"Beware of hiring tall skinny blondes at your restaurant! Yes our waitress was attractive and matched the nice high end d√©cor but the service level was at the same percentile as her iq.   It was 11p on a Wednesday and place was mostly empty, she had us and one other table but we did not see her the whole night! Literally I had to ask the other staff to take care of us.   Our water was not once refilled and never did she even ask how we were doing. I had to send the blackened chicken back which was more like a charred cancer causing chicken. No one was in sight till near the halfway mark of finishing our ribs.   Then after 10 min of us wanting to leave it came and we asked for it to go.   Horrible experience, I think her name is Kaitlyn. Worst part was we had to pay for an experience like this."}
{"text":"3. 5 stars. Earl's is nothing special, except for their Sangria, which I love. Despite this, it is often busy and very loud. The acoustics in this place is awful. However, I do like the seating layout. I've been later at night (after midnight), and it was nice then, because you can get a booth, service is fast, and you can actually talk and hear yourself. It's a plus that they are open until 2 am, especially if you want to go somewhere after the movies. The food is mediocre. The patio is nice. I would go if I was in the area and I had nowhere else to go. I prefer Moxie's next door. However, the wait at Moxie's is extremely lengthy sometimes. I feel like Earl's is a worse version of Moxies."}
{"text":"Earls used to be really great when it first opened. I would have to say the quality has gone downhill. The food was mediocre and the service was extremely slow.  Our waitress did not tend to our table for an entire hour. We were trying to get someone's  attention but were unable to do do.   In addition, this location is freezing during the winter months. The dining room is freezing cold because every time the front door is open the breeze shoots right in.   The bar area seemed warmer since there was no wind chill. Soon enough we could feel the cold temperature coming through the huge glass windows. Everyone at our table was freezing.  The food was sub par. It wasn't too impressive and as someone with two food allergies the kitchen should better inform the servers about the allergens in the food. I asked if the salad was both gluten and lactose free. The waitress checked with the kitchen and informed me it was. Upon receiving my salad, I quickly noticed that the dressing had lactose. This was not something they could easily change since the dressing was all over my salad when it arrived at the table.  I immediately began feeling sick.   I don't think I would go back to this location again."}
{"text":"I wanted to hate Earl's. Maybe it was all the Tequila talking, but I had a really great time and the service was amazing. We never had to wait long for a refill and all the servers rotate around helping all the tables. I expected that since they are known for hiring attractive women that they would also be stupid. They were all really nice and prompt.  We arrived around 3:30 and the patio was already rocking. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table to open up. The decor is really well done, with a beautiful blossoming tree in the middle, edged by pussywillows and some other plants that I am unable to recall as I would up pretty loaded by the end of the evening. It was very windy yesterday and there were all kinds of black shards of something that kept falling in my white wine.  I had just eaten lunch at work so I can't comment on the food, but the sushi roll my friend ordered looked good.  The reason I'm taking a star off is because of the bouncers. They came around at about 4:30 and insisted on stamping our wrists with a paid sign. I had to leave briefly for a meeting just after 5 and on the way back in no less than four bouncers made me show my wrists. Holy crap-- I felt like it was a prison tattoo!  I have to admit that for a chain restaurant,  it is a rockin' place. Lots of suits, but that usually means at least a couple of free drinks cuz when they get drunk, they'll buy rounds for everyone sitting near them! I'd go back... but I'd go earlier and get a bigger table."}
{"text":"I just recently went there to have dinner and watch the leafs game. The bar area is very nice with lots of seating. The servers are good looking and friendly. I ordered spinach artichoke dip, a gormet pizza & the peppercorn steak. Everything I ordered came out great. I got my food fast and the server always cared to make trips to see how everything was going. I enjoyed this location since it was live and classy ambience."}
{"text":"Your Bay St. staple for a business lunch or after work drinks.  Half-decent food for reasonable prices considering location.  Earl's knows how to typecast their waitresses.  Expect a good amount of eye candy if you're a man, and a good amount of wandering eyes if you're not.  The lack in food quality (it really isn't that bad), is made up by the serve staff.  They don't call it \"Earl's Girls\" for nothing.  Show up here later than 6pm on a Thursday and expect to line up to get into the bar area.  The patio is packed in the summer.  I've come back here multiple times just because it's convenient and it's a great spot to bring a (male) client."}
{"text":"The food is so bad, rice undercook, suggest them to learn how to cook rice before putting it on the menu !!!!!!will Never go back"}
{"text":"the girls that serve here are actually really nice to talk too and they're HOT :) food id good but price and i like chilling at the bar most times because the place can get really loud,   lots of men come here (i tottaly don't mind talking about sports and import models and cars though), it's just a little awkward to be lesbian with your girlfriend here.  also i love how the servers are real, it's like they know me and what actually tastes good/ worth your money. Thankyou :)"}
{"text":"I tend to avoid chain restaurants in the suburbs, because of the following:  a) The only food I'm going to get, is a limp \"mixed greens medley\" with the bane of my existence: raspberry vinaigrette. Ugh. Just typing it makes me rage-y. Seriously. If you want me to go off on a full-tilt rant, just whisper in my ear: raspberry vinaigrette.  b) The staff are all 15 and up, it's their first job, and they don't get paid enough to care about you. That means if your food falls on the floor, they're just going to scoop it back up on the plate. If a text from a BFF comes, your food is going to take an extra 20 minutes to arrive. And that person in your group with a bunch of weird food allergies? Is going to either get forgotten, or is going to get a plate full of cold, congealed HISTAMINES.  c) I'm going to be surrounded by Woo Girls on their big night out. Not sure what a \"Woo Girl\" is? Ever gone to a bachelorette party? WOOOOOOOOO!!!!! TAKE IT OFF!!!!  ----  Here's where Earls on 130th shines. As they just opened, they don't have the vegetarian and gluten-free menu that you're told to ask for on the bottom of their menu. But, our waitress was on the ball and was able to make a suggestion that was safe for me to eat. The food here is a little pricey. Two tacos will set you back about $15. At $7.50 per taco, that's pretty steep for something that probably cost $1.50 to whip up.  This would've been a four-star evening if I didn't have to send my food back though, when one of the tacos (with mushrooms swapped out for the chicken it usually comes with) came with melted cheese. And a dipping container full of ketchup. I know I'm asking for hippie food, but I'm not stoned, so the idea of Tacos with Catsup Au Jus is both terrifying and side-eye worthy. Our waitress quickly took them back to replace them, and seemed angry for me that my tacos came with cheese. She also managed to handle a table of about 15 guests pretty easily, with no hiccups in service, and no one forgotten.    Their drink menu is ample, and the price point is reflective of what you're going to pay for cocktails in Cowtown. When I came here on a previous night with a lady friend and her husband, they had a mojito special, where you could get doubles at no extra charge. Their mojitos are delicious and deadly, and their Moscow Mules are on point. I like how it's served in a frosty aluminum tumbler, like a little milkshake.   So, a bit shaky. Leaning toward a 3.5. I'd come back, especially for their Mojito night, and when their grumpy food allergy menus are available. But it's nice to have this place close by, as an alternative to trekking downtown in order to roll with homies."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came in for a 'date night'. We sat in the lounge area on the far end. Our server, Clair, came over right away and brought us water and helped my girlfriend decide on a drink order. We both had the rib & chicken combo to eat. I must say, we were both extremely impressed with the food and service. Our food came out in a very reasonable amount of time and the chicken was cooked perfectly. Clair was always friendly and smiling even if she was just walking around between tables. We sat around for a while after eating and Clair didn't make us feel rushed at all. It's getting rarer to see a server that looks like she enjoys her job, but Clair certainly gave us the impression she did.   The only thing I wasn't a fan of was that there was a football game on and the sound was quite loud. Considering I only noticed one table of 2 guys watching it, maybe turn the sound down or even off. Let people enjoy themselves with soft music and conversation. I've never thought of Earl's as a sports bar as I'm sure others don't either."}
{"text":"I completely agree with other reviews.. Earl's is definitely a bit on the overpriced side (without a reason), but I suppose that's what gives Earl's a rather upscale feel to it!  Our experience was really good. Our server Ali (Ally) ensured we had a very nice evening, and she was very attentive and friendly (living up to Toronto standards, I suppose?).  They didn't have any drink specials, which was disappointing, but the Mrs. got the Mojito which was OK.. I tried the Muskoka Lager (Draft).. was nice..  For dinner/main course, I got the Grilled Fish Tacos with Tortilla soup as my side. The fish tacos were very nice, while the soup was absolutely horrible! Mrs. got the Jeera Chicken Curry, which she absolutely loved.. very flavorful and filling!  Overall, a very nice experience!"}
{"text":"We finally had an opportunity to enjoy our complimentary dinner at Earls. It happened to be our wedding anniversary and our evening couldn't have been any more special.  Huge thanks to the restaurant manager Farra for taking such good care of us, to all the staff, especially our server, who was very professional yet friendly and very attentive. From the unexpected Champagne to toast our anniversary, which I thought was a nice classy touch, then the yummy Dynamite Prawn roll for the appetizer, the main courses of Salmon and Ahi Tuna, the food was all amazing. The presentation was beautiful. Big compliments to the chef! We didn't think we'd have room for desert, but we shared the chocolate hazelnut bar with gelato which was a perfect size and a nice end to an amazing dinner. We really appreciate the effort and the expense to win us back as Earls' customers. We were very impressed with everything and we will be happy to come back soon! Thanks again! Judy"}
{"text":"The food here is reasonable, if you can manage with average service and a lot of noise.   We had the steak frites and fish and chips. The fish was excellent. A little oily, but tasty nonetheless. I would have preferred a small New York steak, the usual fare for steak frites, but the tenderloin was decent and cooked as I ordered, although not all that flavourful. The fries were crispy, how I like them, but somewhat over cooked, so ketchup to the rescue of dried out fries.   I get it's the holidays, and everyone is busy, but that doesn't excuse average service. Still waiting on the water refill that never arrived after asking for it the one time the waiter checked in before we were done.   Oh, and my knife had a bar code on it. Weird."}
{"text":"This place is huge. We were not sure how many rooms there are, but it seemed to go on and on with a large outdoor seating area. Not for winter, but the summer must be nice. A fairly decent beer selection and the food was pretty good. The atmosphere is lively and it was crowded. The wait staff was nice and there is no shortage of attractive looking women. Maybe more so than any other restaurant in recent history, from the staff to the singers to all the customers. Most certainly worth repeated trips."}
{"text":"Service: the waitress took a few minutes to even acknowledge us. She was nice, but she didn't ask how we were or anything like this.   Food: I ordered 6 oz sirloin steak and chicken alfredo. The food was about 6 out of 10 and REALLY NOTHONG SPECIAL. The steak was not tender and chewy. The chicken from chicken alfredo was dry and the pasta was not seasoned properly and not creamy.  Atmosphere: the atmosphere was hip, but not too classy where you'd had to wear slacks. Music is nice.  Cleanliness: the place was clean and tables wiped. The bathroom had toilet paper and paper towels."}
{"text":"The food was simple but pretty decent. However I was disappointed with the ambience. I feel this location does not pay enough attention to details. For example, the menus are now laminate paper in the dining room. Also paper napkins, from a beer company.  Earls used to be a nice place for a date, but I would definitely not come back here for a romantic night out."}
{"text":"Over priced. This place's food are often over priced. The food don't taste bad at all though.  Also, don't order the lobster sandwich meal alone. You will starve after."}
{"text":"You know when you come here your going to get service. The manager that day was amazing, we had a waitress in training, and because of that the manager was making sure everything was perfect. The food is always good if not excellent. I had the Royale Burger with Cheese. This is a beer infused patty of the highest quality certified Angus beef. They claim big flavor and they deliver big flavor. The burger is stacked with cheddar, bacon, onions, Portobello mushrooms, on a freshly backed brioche bun. The beef was juicy, with aromas of beer my mouth, it made an already great ground of beef even better. I know Earl's is a franchise and you all know I don't like giving reviews of franchises, but that day, at Earls, in Woodbridge, I very much enjoyed my 18 dollar burger. Compliments to the kitchen staff, and that excellent dining room manager. (Jan 22ed 2016, lunch time)"}
{"text":"Earl's - food at above average prices. I haven't been to an Earl's in a years and we went to the one across from SAIT Thursday evening. I was really looking forward to it as I remember the food being pretty good. They do make the best Belini on the planet.   Our group was large: 11 people. They had us at these two tables but on the one side, there were 3 of us sitting on this big bench which was very awkward. Our waiter took our drink and appetizer orders and came back with them pretty quickly. I always wonder why places like Earl's use these huge plates for something like a little order of calamari or chicken wings? It looks so silly. Both were pretty tasty though. The Caesar I ordered was pretty bland so I asked for some Worcestershire sauce. I waited. I ate some wings. I waited some more. Finally our waiter came with the W sauce. My friend had already drank her Caesar by this time.   Now for the main course. I chose the Santa Fe chicken salad. Big disappointment. I was looking forward to this salad as I checked it out online earlier in the week and it sounded similar to the one at Applebees which is amazing. This one could not compare. First, it didn't even look that appetizing. A big pile of mess is how I'd describe it. Nothing like the picture on the web. Perhaps the chef should check out their website to see how the salad should look. Second, and most importantly, there was only half a chicken breast. My friend beside me was having the pecan crusted chicken salad and she had twice the chicken on hers. I hunted around my salad to see if the other half was hiding. Maybe the chicken got scared and buried itself under some corn and beans. Nope. It was MIA. So I asked the waiter to get me more chicken.   As I waited for the chicken to arrive, I munched on the salad hoping that it would arrive before I finished. Nope. Finally, the waiter came with a plate with a whole chicken breast on it. Oh thanks. Just what I need to put in on the salad and pack it into a to-go box which I did.  The service tonight was awful. Our waiter did not check on us once to see how our food was. He did not ask if we wanted more drinks. He was unsympathetic when I complained about my salad. This guy has no business working here. I truly expected more from Earl's. The food was mediocre and the service sucked. I know this is one restaurant in a chain of many but that should mean the experience should be the same from one location to another. Not the case with the location on 16th Ave. I doubt I'll be returning to this one for a number of years. Calgary has a lot better places to dine."}
{"text":"Not a great lunch experience. Very noisy with crappy music too loud to talk. Burger was mediocre for 17 bucks! Glass of ice tea was sent back with a disgusting dirty glass.  More than once. Staff were pleasant though"}
{"text":"$4.99 Tuesday night bellinis!  It would have been a great night for the outdoor patio - apparently all the other suits thought so too, so inside the bar we went.  Not too shabby with a large comfy booth.  Chicken tacos - unexpectedly good!  That avocado made the whole thing worthwhile.  It was a bit too loud for me and great for people watching of a particular type.  Earl's is a very slick production that fits perfectly with the financial district that it's located in."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday as a party of 4 without a reservation. The dining room was reserved and the bar/lounge was packed - standing room only. It was 5:30 and we waited for about an hour for a table. It was our fault, but at least they didn't lie about the wait. Waitresses also passed out free champagne and pizza for those waiting for tables.   Once seated, we got a round of drinks. The Wednesday drink special is $5 pints of Albino Rhino, their house beer. I thought it was pretty good value. Others ordered raspberry mojitos and scotch/soda - all pretty standard orders.  I ordered these dishes and shared with one other person: Tuna Poke Nachos - crisp togarashi wontons, tuna, cucumber, avocado and tomato poke, spicy mango coulis, sliced serranos, crushed macadamia nuts - Really fresh and tasty. It's sweet, spicy and refreshing all at the same time. Eat it first so the wontons don't get soggy.  Dungeness Crab and Asparagus Linguini - saffron cream sauce, tomatoes, asparagus, lemon oil, prawns and Dungeness crab - The pasta was good, perfectly al dente. The cream sauce was flavourful, but not heavy. The only complaint might be not enough crab or prawn. The prawns were cut up into centimeter cubes so it would distribute better, but I think in total probably about 2-3 prawns - not much.  Dominical Fish Tacos - two flour tortillas, grilled lime and coriander marinated wahoo, mango and avocado salsa, spicy Valentina crema - Very flavourful, but could have used more filling. The spicy crema was indeed spicy, kind of tasted like the spicy mayo that Japanese restaurants use.  Service was very attentive. I got up to use the washroom, pointed to my glass and told my friends to get another pint for me if they saw the waitress. And when I got back, my friends hadn't asked yet, and our waitress already brought one by.  Pretty much everyone there works in the financial district - suits and ties. The atmosphere was really loud and busy. At some points, I felt like I was shouting to be heard, but we had a table not a booth. It's really boisterous, for people who want to unwind at the end of the day, not romantic or calming.  I'd go back to try more of the food, but definitely get a reservation at least a day in advance."}
{"text":"Been to both the King St. W and Colossus locations.  From my experience, the ambiance is great-- I enjoy the live music in the summer on weekends.  Great place to come watch the game with some friends and enjoy a few drinks.  My favourite dish at Earls has to be, hands down, the Santa Fe Chicken Salad.  With the blackened chicken, feta, dates, beans, and avocado, this salad is good right to the very end.  The peanut vinaigrette compliments all of the ingredients-- I've actually tried to replicate this salad at home to no avail.  At $17.00, it is well worth the price, compared to similar restaurants.  My only concern is the lighting in this place... I understand that the dim lighting adds to the ambiance, but for goodness sake, I felt like I had to feel my way through my meal.  4 Stars, and I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Great service and excellent food.! If you want a great atmosphere go to earls! Try out the patio in the summer!"}
{"text":"Didn't think id like this place but must say I was pleasantly surprised by the food, service and drink selections. I was also a little shocked by the good prices considering the location the place is in.  I had their burger which was great and a bunch of their rhino lagers which were quite tasty.  The only issue I had was how disgusting their bathrooms were.  The place is quite busy I would expect them to be cleaned regularly but instead it was just a complete mess with piss everywhere and no paper towels.  I'm pretty shocked they don't have someone looking after the bathrooms full-time."}
{"text":"I love Earls and anywhere I go if there is an Earls that is where you will find me. I've been to this location in the past and had a great time but this Sunday was a whole different story. We were seated promptly by a hostess and then proceeded to be ignored by the server for about 15 when we saw her go to a manager and tell her to come over. We then ordered our drinks from her and then it took about 10 minutes to receive the drinks. I then asked for a straw for my drink and I got a huge sigh from the manager, I could not believe how unprofessional this leader was. This went on for ever round we got. Apparently the team work mentality is not a thing at this location as I saw many servers look at the drinks and walk away. Once we finally got our order taken it was clear she did not know the menu very well. Then we waited for quite a while for our food to come out only for one of my friends orders to be completely wrong, she ordered the 2 egg breakfast with bacon on a separate plate as she is a vegetarian, the manager brought out an egg Benedict which is not even close. We told her it was wrong and she just kinda stared at us, once we repeated again what the original order was she said she would get the right meal. That took awhile once again. My bread for my avocado toast was rock hard and all the potatoes were oily and overall just not very good. After all that once we got the bill my girlfriends food was left on and we had ordered during brunch happy hour but since she rang in the wrong meal then charged my friend full price. Overall a poor experience and it's clear why this was one of the slowest restaurants."}
{"text":"Came here twice while on a recent business trip in Toronto. Based on the reviews, we decided to bring clients here for lunch, and then we came back again that night for dinner.  Definitely one of the few instances of a business meal I can remember where all the plates were devoured. Over lunch, I really enjoyed the Italia pizza, which is essentially an Italian meat lover's pizza. My colleagues gave their entrees rave reviews, including the salmon, Santa Fe chicken salad, and spicy seafood pasta.  Upon returning that night, I had the chicken tacos and substituted the soup of the day (black bean) for the standard side of fries. Both were excellent. As a group, we ordered the s'mores for dessert, and they definitely didn't last long.  Presentation and service were fantastic throughout both meals. Can't wait to return.  One potential drawback is that the music is a little too loud. It's a very eclectic mix of music, but definitely too loud for conversation with your \"inside voice.\" At points during lunch, we were straining to hear each other. But, if you're prepared for that ahead of time, I think it'll be just fine."}
{"text":"The food here was good. Nothing really wowed me but I wasn't disappointed either. The ambiance was nice and the waitresses and hostess were friendly and inviting.  I ordered the ribs here and they were pretty good and tender. I enjoyed the bbg sauce. I had hot potato salad and the yam fries. Wish I would have gotten the ceasar salad in replacement of one of my side dishes."}
{"text":"Highclass hooters with pretty wicked sweet potato fries, I like their burger too. I dont mind Earls, but would not go here unless I was already at the mall."}
{"text":"Not so great.... Service sucked, we weren't checked by ignorant server and our water wasn't filled when we needed some more water. Food: Brunch menu, I had a meal of Eggs Benedict... Blah! But the daytime manager, Tyler. He's really amazing, and he made our morning better."}
{"text":"Earls is a regular spot for work lunches and dinner! We went for dinner with a decent group size and were provided a table with minimal wait. We shared Warm Spinach Dip along with Garlic Fries for starters. I had Bibimbap with Tofu which was perfectly made.  Though the waiter had bought wrong order initially, he corrected it in no time and overall experience was good.  Do try the in-house Earls Lager."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with a party of four and sat outside on their awesome patio.   Our group did our standard 'order a bunch of appetizers' thing and were pleased with all of them. We ordered (deep breath): tuna poke nachos, fish tacos, meatball sliders, prawn dynamite roll and spinach & feta dip.  The tuna poke nachos stood out as my favorite, but there was seriously not a bad dish in the group.   Service was attentive but not intrusive. And our server was happy to make recommendations (which is always appreciated)."}
{"text":"Very very disappointed.... went in at 8pm - was told 20-25 min wait. Requested have 3 small kids and to seat us as soon as they can- seated everyone else and we were still waiting 35 min later! Asked again and were advised another 25 min!!! Really!?? Ok waited again now it's 9:10 asked AGAIN and we're told another 20 min!! Really!!?? Is this what you call service?? No respect for others time? Specially when we have 3 small kids and we waited patiently... not even ONE word of apology-  Will never go there again and make sure none of my friends with kids go there! Highly dissapointed."}
{"text":"Love Earls! They just keep changing it up but keep their bests. Our favourites are the Margarita Pizza, Hunan Kung Pow (with three peppers), Caesar salad and of course the pastas! If you can hit a wing Wed, jackpot! Servers are attentive but not overly and have personality!  If you have room for dessert, split it with two forks/spoons. They are ginormous!"}
{"text":"First time here with friends and dinner was just okay.  Less than a handful of entrees for health-savvy patrons to choose from.  While very commendable that their website has the nutritional information easily accessible on each menu category's page, why not make the effort to offer more healthy items if you're going for full disclosure?  I literally had 2 items to choose from...and they weren't even my top picks for culinary experience.  Not picking on Earls in particular but kinda horrendous that a dinner portion can easily pack 900-1300 calories!  Corporate irresponsibility if you ask me.  Anyway, we had the chicken and field mushroom fettuccini (presentable, palatable, not amazing, $18.25 for pasta is quite pricey) and Los Cabos chicken tacos (nothing special, two small tacos that I could have easily had for a mere fraction of the price at Taco Bell, again very pricey for $15.00, didn't realize side salad was an extra $1.50).  Only upside was that service was prompt and we easily found parking, ha!  Would never patronize again.  Not because it was a horrendous experience but because we can easily find better value for our money, anywhere else in Square One!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have fallen in love with the Earls's chain! We have never been disappointed with the food we received and have always left with nothing but satisfaction.   We have been to this location twice, and have received phenomenal service from the waiters each time. They were friendly, never forgot to refill our water, and even though the restaurant gets fairly busy, they made sure to stop by our table and see how we're doing.   I think my favourite menu item is the soup special with a side salad served with pan bread. Their broccoli cheese soup is to die for! My husband who is a meat lover has tried several of their meat dishes and has loved the assortment.   Pictured is my cucumber lime drink that went great with the Margherita pizza."}
{"text":"This is a go to for me ordering meals for executives at work. They always rave about how good the food is. That said, dining in is a terrible experience. Male dominant tables receive far more attention and better service than tables with females. Servers do not make eye contact let alone look the way of a female. Males empty drinks are noticed far quicker and attended to before females. I am a firm believer in tipping and will tip well when deserved. I can appreciate if a restaurant is particularly busy service can be lacking but if it is slow there is no excuse to be overlooked. This is a reoccurring problem and management should address the sexism with their servers."}
{"text":"Been totally enjoying my their happy hour menu! A great place to join some friends for a drink and an appetizer!!! And I love the decor of the restaurant and bar... plus our waitstaff is super friendly and good every time we are in!"}
{"text":"I had the fish tacos, they were excellent. Service was fantastic. It was a little loud, but a nice enough place to enjoy a dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Generally speaking , i'm a fan of Earls chains but this location is just bad. My first experience was negative , but i put that aside and tried again. The food was relatively good, but the service is just sub par. This time they had run out of the liquor used in the drink special, and they were all out of french fries. This will be the last time we return to this location :("}
{"text":"We had wanted to dine at Famoso but there was a half hour wait and we were starving. Walked up the road a bit and voila, there was Earl's with no wait time and I had an Earl's gift card burning a hole in my pocket.  I liked that there was a hostess at the ready for us to get us seated. The lounge was packed and very loud so we opted for the dining room and there was a table ready for us right away. Too bad we were seated next to the screaming, crying baby in the room. I would argue that this restaurant is NOT for children/babies.  Overall, the food here was pretty good. The service - not so much. We ordered a caesar salad to start and the waitress was kind enough to have that split into 2 plates for us. The salads here are huge. The caesar is - well, boring. No bacon and it does not come with any lemon to jazz it up. Had to ask for the lemon and ground pepper. We had asked the waitress how the baby calamari was upon ordering and she said it was pretty good. We agreed that the salads would be plenty with our full meals and that next time, we would try the calamari. Wouldn't you know it, the calamari was brought to our table anyways with our salad. Hmmm. We mentioned to our server that we did not order it and she advised that as long as we did not touch it she would bring it back to the kitchen and implied that it would be re-served to someone else. Really? I would not want that happening to me so we told told her that we would just keep it, thanks. Error #1.  I ordered a 7 oz steak that came with a really nice whisky sauce and some button mushrooms over top. The veg was a couple of cut up roasted red pepper pieces and purple onion. They could have used a little imagination for a $26 plate and used asparagus. I did enjoy the meat, it was cooked rare, to order and I loved the mashed potatoes too. I would be hard pressed though call these garlic mashed as were described on the menu. Too bad. I love garlic and there was not a hint of it in there. I finished my drink and ordered another - which NEVER came. Error 2. No waters were ever poured for us either throughout the whole meal, none offered. By the way I ordered my first Earl's Bellini as my first drink and I really liked it. Very peachy, very summery and cold.  Hubby ordered his usual hamburger with cheese (extra charge of course for cheese) yam fries (extra change of course) and for dipping, on the plate was a really nice curry- mango sauce. Inventive, we both liked that and the fries were killer yummy. I took half my meal to go as the unexpected calamari kind of filled me up and dessert never even crossed our minds, we were so full. Not that we were offered any - the server approached us and advised that she was off shift and could we settle our bill? I guess so, sure. She advised that one of her colleagues would be checking on us as she scooted on out of there but that never happened.  Service fell down tonight, was not on point, the server was in lala land and there was just no efficiency whatsoever.  I felt that the food was good enough that the review warranted 3 stars but maybe that is too kind. I am in a generous mood today. I guess I was in a generous mood last night too as despite all all server's flaws, she still made her 15%. But she was standing right there as I entered the tip into the machine too so - what else could I do?    I doubt we would ever make a point to come back here - too bad. They could do much better business if they would step up their game a bit and do some staff training. I can see by the other reviews as well that this place is struggling to keep its lackluster overall 3 stars."}
{"text":"I didn't mind this location... I wasn't completely \"wowed\" in my overall experience, but I do have minor complaints. Nothing too major though.   Service: Wasn't  the fastest, it was busy, but still should have been a little faster. It took a while for the waitress to even notice us sitting there, many tables were left to be cleaned.. So someone was behind in that regard. We sat at a table that wasn't cleaned, but it was a good seat, so we waited. Our waitress was really nice, tried to say she couldn't accommodate something .. Buut my bestie was there and she used to work for earls so she knew it was a simple request haha. Can't pull that on an ex earls employee! Lol.   Taste: Earls food never really fails me. Lol. I had the rocket salad with a beautifully crusted chicken, it was fabulous. I love beets and goat cheese, and crusted chicken mmmmm Soo Delish. On point. My pig (name for my bestie lol) had the chicken & rib combo. Omfg the ribs are SO juicy and fab they fall right off the bone . And omg the flavour .. Wow. And yes, I did get her to order the full order so I can steal some ribs hahha. Annnd we indulged in desert, I had the toffee pudding cake & she had the warm cookie with vanilla bean ice cream. Wow. AmaZing!   Presentation: Presentation was quite nice, chefs did a great job. I love that in the desert they make their own caramel bowls for the ice cream, was pretty cool and totally aesthetically pleasing to the eye! Very pretty. My salad was plated and portioned very nicely. The portion size for the the chicken and ribs was massive lol I won't lie hahha yes it's the \"full order\", but I feel like it's so much food 2 people can honestly order one full order and be good to go haha. Presentation of the restaurant however, wasn't too pleasing to the eye .. As I mentioned, many tables were left to be cleaned ..   Atmosphere: Was an ok Atmosphere , music wasn't too loud, it was busy but didn't feel super cramped or anything. Atmosphere was like any other earls really.   Overall experience:   Again, wasn't \"wowed\", but wasn't upset or anything. Was average. The company I was with really made the experience much better haha. The food is generally always on point at Earls, so it's good eats for sure! Jst not sure if I'd go out of my way for this particular location again.   M.M."}
{"text":"The staff was as dumb as it was good looking... I'm used to not getting treated well at restaurants, but this place actually made me leave crying... Why?"}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with Happy Hour. I'm from Houston and went with a co-worker and I remember the decor. The first time I went I ordered some fish tacos and had two mojitos (maybe more) which were made just right. The second time I went I had a steak which was done simple but great. I guess if you want a place to chill and enjoy great food, a cold beverage and some great convo with your friends; this is the place. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did."}
{"text":"While on an overnight layover on our way back to the states, we wanted to get some food that was a decent meal. After eating tapas in Spin for a week, I was craving a vegetable and a well balanced meal. Our hotel concierge recommended Earl's. They have a nice outside patio that's first come, first serve. Sadly it was full so we had to sit inside. It was a Monday, so their drink special was $5 margaritas. Music to my ears bc a their normal price of a margarita was $10+. I ordered a mango margarita and a regular margarita. The mango margarita was okay, it didn't have much mango flavor. It tasted more like a lime margarita with a splash of mango flavor. The regular margarita was great. I also ordered the bread, which was great. For my entree, I ordered the blackened salmon with the seasonal veggies and rice. The salmon was good and seasoned very well. The rice had good flavor and the seasoned vegetables were broccolini, which was delicious.  Overall, the food and atmosphere at Earl's is great. If I'm ever back in Toronto, I'm making a stop here and hopefully I can get a patio table if the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Food is always good at Earls! Not as good as the rest kitchen but I don't think we have ever been disappointed. Service is always good and attentive."}
{"text":"Giving 1 star is more than generous.   Friend reserved for a group of 16 on a Saturday night (7:30pm for birthday). Friend called to confirm as well on the day of to make sure we have the table. They said everything is taken care of. Guess what? Saturday night came and they didn't put us for reservations. They quoted us an hour and we didn't get seated until 9:00pm.   The staff was very unorganized and considering that they made a huge grp wait for that long, they barely offered anything to make up for the service and their error.   We are not there to get FREE food but at least give something complimentary. I've worked in a restaurant too so giving a little something to paying customers is usually nothing for the restaurant. Mind you, we also had an event to go to afterwards and not everyone can make it because we left the restaurant late.  Finally 9:00pm - ppl were seated. Food took so long to come. Our server was nice but also ignored us like twice when we tried to flag her down. Bill took more than 30 mins.   Food is subpar - some were good and others were okay. Jacks, Moxies and Joeys are better. Portions were small except for the Cajun Chicken  Bottom line for Earls, Concord: Shitty Service - I don't even think the Manager cares. Food is sub-par and overpriced but drinks were GREAT.   Advice: When a situation like this happens, your guest should be a priority throughout the night. Everything just went downhill as soon as we arrived at the restaurant.  I still tipped more than 15% because our server got our orders right but it wasn't the best service. Others didn't tip at all."}
{"text":"Thanks for the great night Earls! We made a reservation for the dining room and we went early, and the excellent and wonderful hostess Meghan set us up on the patio for a cocktail before dinner and then we arrived to a great booth for our meal. We finished dinner, which all tasted great and went back out the patio for another cocktail on the patio. I love the atmosphere of being in the middle of all the high rises on ground level. People watching here is hilarious. It feels like a night club at 6:30pm! Thanks for the fun girls night, we will be back! :)"}
{"text":"Sucked.  Arrived around 5, well before the dinner rush started.  Ordered margherita pizza which was pretty dinky for $13.00. Not only that it wasn't traditional thin crust pizza and the cheese made it taste like a Pizza Hut abomination.  My man ordered fish & chips and the fries were totally cold. By then the server had largely ignored us, hadn't brought water, and didn't check in on us after the food runner delivered our food. Deciding I'd had enough, I had to go to the girl seating guests as the entire staff were having their team meeting at 5:45. The manager and server came by shortly after and both apologized. The fish & chips were comped.   Still, considering the decor and finishes are cheap, service sucks, and the prices are downtown high - Don't bother."}
{"text":"Great Ambience. Great Crowd. Great service. I frequent this place any time i am around square one. Havent been let down once. It was am afternoon on a Saturday, an we went bar hopping all around the city, and this was the joint that where we ended up spending the most amount of time."}
{"text":"Your typical kitchen + bar . Came here with my girlfriend on a Friday night for some food and drinks. We had to wait a bit to get seated as all the tables in the dining area were full. While we waited we went to the bar/lounge area to grab some drinks. It was very busy so it took the server a while to come to us. I felt like they were understaffed   I ordered a negroni which I hated, it was probably my fault and not the restaurants. My girlfriend got a mojito which was really good.  When we got seated in the dining area, we got seated right beside the door which was really cold! We waited another few minutes to get better seats but in the end they ended up being a bit cold as well.  I ordered a burger which was meh and my girlfriend ordered the salmon which she really enjoyed. I wouldn't recommend this place for the food, however I would recommend it if you wanted to go out for just drinks. It had a great ambience and the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"5 second summary: Mediocre/average food (except the desserts, which are great), boring decor, great service. Might be a bit loud for those looking to bring a date, but otherwise a good option if you're in the area: you'll enjoy the meal and it has a friendly atmosphere. Lots of competition with moxies, jack astors and others in the immediate area as well.  Reason for 3 stars: The apps and entrees were ok, while the dessert was great.   Would I go back? Yes - but mainly for dessert.   Loong review:    Good looking staff + modern decor + decent food seems to be the recipe for success these days, and earls has seen plenty of it over the past few years.  The ever expanding franchise opened up a new location in Woodbridge this past week, right next to the Colossus movie theater, and it follows the same tried and true recipe, although it executes on some parts better than others.  Food at these neo-American restaurants is typically isn't the strong point, good enough so people enjoy the meal, but you're coming for the drinks, atmosphere and service.  Call me Picky, but I've rarely had a meal that blows me away at one of these places, except for Joeys @ Don Mills. Earls pretty much falls into the same category as these places, with medicore food, though not spectacular, save the desserts which are frickin good, especially the smores. While the starters & entrees are good, the dessert is the strong point here, so definitely save room.  I came here with a few friends and we shared multiple things. Full rundown at the end of the review.  As most folks head to earls for the atmosphere, I'll mention it here as well. There's a nice entrance with a stone exterior and an outdoor fireplace, 'cause, we all know how cold it gets in the winter, right? Indoors, it's dimly lit and there's little separation between the bar and restaurant areas, so it may be a bit noisy for some seeking a quieter dinner (i.e. on a date).  The decor is similarly dark and I'd say on the verge of old fashioned or boring. Those chandeliers they have in the restaurant section have got to go though, it's a round piece of wood with lights circling the thing, I wouldn't be surprised it they came straight from Medieval Times.  There was nothing medieval, rough, or boring about the service though. The staff, manager and hostess' were all very kind, friendly, inviting and made you feel comfortable.   Starters: Ceasar salad - pass on it. boring. Spinach dip - delicious. comes with deep fried bread and the dip is very good. Eat it quick, once that dip goes cold it's not nearly as good.  Entrees: Salmon - well cooked, well seasoned and a healthy portion, it was an enjoyable dish. Fairly standard, though anyone ordering this isn't looking for a \"wow\" dish Steak w/ some mushroom sauce - well cooked, thick cut though small portion (looked like a filet, but not sure it was), it was a fairly average steak at a restaurant. You won't go wrong with it, it's a safe pick Steak (sauceless) - Dry for my liking, wasn't juicy enough for me to order it again. I'd go for the sauced version. Pizzas - the pizzas are ok, thin crust and not overpowering with any one ingredient. Another safe order Salad with prawns - this was really good. I enjoy sweeter salads, and this was one of them, coming with a mix of berries, nuts cheese and lightly glazed with a sweet dressing.  A healthy portion of shrimps was given in the salad as well.  Chicken club sandwich - typical chicken club, meh Pasta -  I tried two pastas, both were mediocre. One with a tomato sauce was a bit sour, and the other with an alfredo sauce was a bit bland and the pasta undercooked.  I'd shy away from the pasta, but I'm not a big pasta fan anyhow.  Chicken Curry w/ Nann and Rice - I'm always surprised that there's Indian dishes at these places, but I guess that attests to Toronto's multi-culturism. Anyhow, the curry was alright, not overly spiced, the rice had been buttered up so it was good, and the nann was fresh, though didn't have those burnt edges/seared surface that I love.   Desserts: Sundae in caramel toffee bowl - the bowl itself is made from some caramel/toffee mixture I think, so it's edible, and delicious. It's what sets the dish apart from other places. There aren't many toppings on it though, I wish it did. Chocolate toffee cake - it's delicious, sweet, warm, rich, it's great. Cheesecake - my friends liked this more than I did. It's a good portion and not very sweet. I'm a fan of sweet and creamy cheesecakes (i.e. Cheesecake factory) and this was the less creamy, less sweet kind.  Smores - I'm saving the best for last because this was AWESOME. Homemade marshmallows, homemade graham crackers with a gingery tint to it (if you like Starbuck's ginger molasses cookie,you'll LOVE this) and melted chocolate. Comes with two smores... mmmmmmmmmmm... so much better than making them around a camp fire.  This is the one dish I would definitely get for dessert, though you can't go wrong with the cake"}
{"text":"Just your average food place. Decent food and fast service. Went on a week night and was not crowded at all. Not too many vegetarian options. The margaritas were over priced even for the specials."}
{"text":"Had the chicken tacos.  They were really good, along with a side caesar salad.  They were good.  I asked for a suggestion of a beer, and the waitress suggested the Pale Ale made for Earl's (I can't recall the name).  I totally ignored her and asked for an Alexander Keith's IPA.  She kind of looked at me alarmingly.  In the past couple of months, I have noticed that the staff in bigger cities are starting to do a good job of knowing what good beers are.  We were here on a Sunday afternoon.  Not crowded.  In fact, I think we were the only people eating inside.  Everyone else chose the patio.  The day manager helped us to understand the trolley and subway system.  He was a great help!  There were these HUGE burgers they were carting out.  I didn't realize this was a chain.  Good service, big food, and it appeared to be a decent beer selection, although it was mostly macros."}
{"text":"A favorite in a sea of brands!! You know it!! If the atmosphere suits than it works. Service at the bar is great!"}
{"text":"Lesson learned - I will NEVER come back here again... We met a couple of friends in who were town and this marked the 2nd time ever I have been to an Earl's. I was up for a good evening knowing the company would be amazing and we were even semi dressed-up. However, something told me in the back of my mind this experience would not measure up to the last visit to Earl's on 16th Ave. This was our friends' choice of location and I am eager to try every restaurant in Calgary even if it takes me 80 years so of course we were agreeable. :) We walked in and were swamped with waitresses and fought through them waving them off politely to get to our party who were already standing right there to greet us. The staff offered to take my coat - nice gesture but NO thanks. I think all of us have fallen prey to jacket theft before and I did not want to lose my new Mexx. I would have frozen to death tonight without it had it been taken! Anyways, we waited an eon for our first round of drinks. Took awhile with the menu as nothing was really screaming out to the 4 of us. I feel that Earl's should have more fish dishes on the menu than just salmon. Plus, I feel, even for Calgary standards the entire menu is overpriced. I ended up ordering the clam chowder and baby calamari. The rest of the party ordered: Bronx hamburger (stale bun, ick) and $2 extra for yam fries is ridiculous when the burg is $17 to start with. Veggie Quesadilla which was deemed to be \"hot\" by the eater when anything remotely spicy was requested omitted from the dish. Salad/bread and soup (clam chowder) combo whereby the eater really had no comment. My own clam chowder was bland sooo from my purse it was my cayenne pepper to the rescue! Totally edible though and at least warmer than warm in temperature. I was more disappointed in the calamari. Lacking flavour, I had to totally spice it up myself and add a ton of lemon. Would NOT recommend. Sigh, after all that time in choosing off the menu... If I am paying a fortune for dinner I want it to be more than OK. Wine overpriced and nothing special for $11 a glass. Service was a 1 out of 5. Our waitress forgot everything, from lemons, to sour cream to our drinks to napkins to the split cheque. Clueless. Atmosphere was decent, not too, too busy and we were able to get a table without a problem. If the food is sub-par though and the service sucks, it is just not worth our hard earned dough. Like I said, thank God for good company but I will never come back here."}
{"text":"Grab a bite to eat at 6pm on a Wed night before heading to a TIFF film.  It's a busy place and so noisy it's just not worth the effort to have a conversation unless you feel like yelling and / or you're under 35 and don't think you're yelling.  They have half price on glass or bottle of wine tonight!  Ordered Jerusalem salad and the chicken tacos.  Server is friendly and we were seated and served promptly.  Food is good although my salad came with a literal pool of dressing on the bottom of the plate.  Lots of great eye candy in both the servers and the clientele if you're into that.  Mix or business crowd and the young and hip."}
{"text":"Were visiting Toronto for my wife's birthday, and we decided to celebrate with dinner at Earls.  In retrospect, Tim Hortons would have been a better option.  I love the back story of Earls, but I imagine any remaining Earl has to be pretty disappointed as to what it has become.   The hostess was pleasant and seated us quickly.  But the moment we sat down, we noticed an excessively filthy rag of some sort at the base of our table. It was soaked in red that we hoped was just barbecue sauce and not blood.  Thankfully, the waiter gave us about fifteen minutes to discuss our theories about the rag before finally bringing us menus and taking our drink orders. The dining room was filled with vapid looking and acting pretty people who seemed oblivious to their surroundings.  Imagine a bar full of Kardashians just stumbling around in their zombie-way always talking a bit too loud and getting in the way of anyone trying to make their way to the restroom or the door.  While quite curious as to what manner of filth sullied the rag, we ended up just having a drink and and escaping before learning just how disappointing their dinner service could be.    A block up the street the Drake was more than happy to provide us with a dinner experience befitting my wife's birthday."}
{"text":"Earl's gets four stars for self awareness. For a chain that offer a spacious and nicely designed semi-sports bar vibe and modern fusion-y bar food (downtown), they deliver on this unsurprising mainstream promise rather well. It's not economy but it's not fancy pants either. We were there on a Saturday afternoon so it was busy, but not crazy busy, and the service was friendly and efficient. I had a burger and it was a pretty good burger - so high praise for that.   Full disclosure: The first time I ate at an Earl's was in the 80s in Red Deer Alberta. I was a young teen and not exactly worldly. And they had this thing called a 'Teriyaki Burger' that came with a pineapple slice on it. Man that was some crazy international cuisine. I loved that burger."}
{"text":"We had never been to an Earl's before and we hit the joint at 6pm on a Friday night with another couple. And.... we got a table in the dining room! I was fearful there would be a wait as we always drive by and the place appears packed all the time! Not tonight! Wow, good decor, nice lighting... and the food! Yes, I am a fan. I was not feeling so hot all day so I just ordered the clam chowder which is always hit or miss at all places but I loved it and cleaned my bowl. This was accompanied by a piece of garlic toast which was a giant thick slab of focaccia. Not my fave choice of bread but I liked it very much anyways, soft and fresh! My hubby had a burger (what else is new! lol) and he gave it a 10 out of 10! He still talks about it after we have arrived home! Nice bun, real bacon, great quality of beef, meat cooked well, fresh tomato - all he can say is JUICY to describe it (I tried 2 bites, it was good and I am picky about burgers, I never order them for that reason)! Our partners in crime tonight shared a pulled pork sandwich which they liked a lot that came with fries. They compared the fries to be as good as McDonald's - I tried them and I would have to agree! They also ordered the soup special of the day and it was cream of mushroom. I did not dare dip my spoon into their bowl but the mushrooms were plentiful and FRESH! I love fresh - did I mention that? Haha... Our server - he was busy but he aimed to please and he had a great personality! We decided that when these friends are in town we will always meet at Earl's for eats. Everyone around us had really great looking, great smelling dishes also! Small details like sugaring the rim on my special coffee, replacing cutlery after it was bumped off the table and would have garnered this place a 5 out of 5. I think we will be back, even just the 2 of us sooner than later and I may even order a burger!!!! Thanks Earl's!"}
{"text":"Called ahead.  Promised a 10 min wait. Waiting an hour now with hungry kids.    So far not impressed. And no one really seems to care."}
{"text":"Big boobs serving big boobs.  Food is delicious. Would probably taste better on someone's expense account though - it's pricey for what it is.  I haven't checked out the patio yet, and it does look nice.  Faster service if you don't have a uterus."}
{"text":"Me and cousins came here for dinner, and the service here was horrible. First, no one attended us to ask what we wanted to order. Which was a hour. Then the food took another hour to come. The yam fries we order had too much salt on it. When have you seen yam fries with salt? Another thing is, my fork was dirty. Asked for another one and that one was dirty as well. And there was so many fruit flies flying around. When we finally got the food it super oily. Like drenched in oil. My cousins food was actually good. I will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"I love the d√©cor, they have a nice waiting area for sitting when waiting for a table. However, the food was such a disappointment!   We ordered the calamari for appetizer, and it came out in a decent time but it has a weird taste to it. Oddly enough the calamari was pushed to one side of the dish and the other half was filed with sauce. Odd? The calamari was not crunchy and I actually liked eating the Jalape√±o more than the actual calamari. Husband ordered the half ribs with potatoes and it came with coldslaw. The coldslaw was soooooo hard to chew! The ribs was decent, the potatoes was amazing - it's covered with corn, bacon and sugar? I believe - but it was good. I ordered the fish taco. I could barely find the fish, and again it was filled with the hard coldslaw - my mouth got tired from chewing. The fish taco didn't come with any sauce - so I had to load my fish taco with hot sauce! The salad however was good.  My friend ordered the grilled chicken and salad. She finished the plate - so I assumed it was good! But then again, you can't really go wrong with grilled chicken and salad.  The service was amazing, but the flavour of the food was just really lacking - I would probably not come back for the food. However, I would come back for a nice drink/snacks! They do have a really nice atmosphere for that."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and it was just okay.  I ordered the Spicy Seafood pasta and it was a bit dry and with few prawns and scallops in it (they were small scallops, too). The calamari was good, though.  I probably need to stick to something more traditional like steak or burger.  The service was very good.  Waitress was nice and always checked back with me."}
{"text":"Dropped by here for a late night snack.  The dining area closes around midnight but we were seated in the dining room anyway..otherwise you can eat in the bar area.  We ordered the swordfish tacos and korean wings.  The wings were very good, fried crisp and coated with a tangy sauce and topped with fried onions.  Although it was an appetizer portion it could easily be a meal paired with fries or a salad.  The fish tacos were underwhelming, overcooked and under seasoned.  Service was excellent and prompt given the late hour.  I would likely return given they are open until 2am."}
{"text":"I would have given a 5 star to this restaurant from my last two visits, but recently I came on a sunday night and was disappointed in the change. For some reason, on a weekend there was an abnormally amount of seats available, we didn't have to wait at all. The service is 5 stars but I don't like how they changed the menu. I used to order the field mushroom and chicken Alfredo which tasted amazing and I would always come back because of that. But it's not on the menu anymore :(. I ordered the chicken tacos with fries. The fries were amazing, but the taco was only OK. The appetizers I ordered we're calamari and the spinach dip with bread. Both tasted amazing, only the calamari had a low quantity imo. Overall food was good and service was good, but not AMAZING like it was the last few times I came."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service.  the baked salmon is really good. A must try!!!!  Also the dynamite roll was very good."}
{"text":"Got dinner here with a couple of coworkers. It was super crowded and there was a long lineup on a weekday. Thankfully we had reservations. Our waitress was pretty good at getting most of our orders right except one. I ordered the grilled fish tacos and the pineapple in them made the taste really fresh. Super messy to eat though and came with just your average thin kind of fries. Overall it was a good atmosphere, I really liked the seating inside and would love to try something on the patio next time. It was odd though to have brown paper napkins in such a classy restaurant with a pricey menu - (Edit: BUT it turns out it plays a part in trying to be as environmentally responsible as they can, seeing as they are compostable and made of reclycled materials, bonus points.)"}
{"text":"The Warm Spinach + Three Cheese Dip was quite underwhelming.  I love cheese dips but this one didn't satisfy me at all.  It was made with artichoke, creamy garlic, and chives, and served with toasted flatbread.  I didn't like this Three Cheese Dip because it was so heavy and dense.  There was a lot of it (so the portion was good), but since it was so thick, it was hard to enjoy a creamy dip.  It was definitely cheesy though but could have tasted better if the consistency wasn't so thick.  The toasted flatbread was all right; I found it too hard but Ken liked it.  Since we had eaten a small appetizer before coming and I wasn't starving, I ordered the Salad, Soup, + Pan Bread.  I really just wanted to try their clam chowder soup and have a salad.  I didn't care for the included Pan Bread at all.  For this item, you could pick between a Caesar or Field Greens Salad and Clam Chowder or their feature soup.  The Earls Famous Clam Chowder was New England style with full cream, chopped tomatoes, parsley, with a hint of smoky bacon.  It was available on the menu in a small or large size ($8 and $11 respectively).  I guess for this soup, salad, and bread combo, they served the small size.  I enjoyed the Field Greens Salad.  There was balsamic vinegar with some goat cheese and toasted nuts and the salad itself was fresh.  I wasn't a fan of the Clam Chowder because I felt that it just wasn't very good.  There were a lot of chunks of vegetables in it; I didn't expect that.  The soup itself was a little thin with all of the ingredients sinking to the bottom.  There were a fair number of clams in it.  The consistency was also quite blah."}
{"text":"Great location. Great atmosphere.   They're menu looks good - good options - there's something for everyone.   We had:  Chilli Chicken & Wontons - these were really good. Loved it.   House Salad - delicious!  Chicken, Brie & Fig Sandwich - I actually was not a fan of this sandwich. I found it too sweet and the texture was too soft. It would have been better if the apple had a crunch to it, or  if there was a crunchy ingredient to give it a layered texture.   Lois Lake Steelhead Salmon - great  My only complaint was that when our waitress came to clean our plates, I forgot to ask to save some of the food to go, and she didn't ask either. She just came back with the bill. If there's a lot of food left on the plate, the waitress always asks if you would like to take it home. This was a first for me - I never ask to box it up because the waitress always asks me, so this time I didn't even think about it and my food was tossed. Make sure to ask for your food to go before the tables been cleared."}
{"text":"I want to give this place 3.5 stars but I can't do that. It's a great place with a great vibe for lunch or after work drinks.  I've been several times over the years and the service and food were always good.  In the last little while I find that the service while always friendly, has become spotty, some days good, some days, not so much.... and the food quality has declined a little.  I'd recommend for drinks on the patio but food and service are just slightly above average at best, and sub-par at worst."}
{"text":"Generally like the place. Pleasant staff, reasonably priced and a good place to watch sports on the bar side. One thing I did note earlier this week was that the chicken wings are particularly small. More like sparrows!"}
{"text":"I know I've written a review on Earls before but I haven't been there since they updated their menu. It's pretty extravagant! I went down there last night with the boyfriend (just to clarify! I write these for my boss, and I am a woman, so he is not gay :) I thought I would save him from some more embarrassment) Anyways, we went down and were seated quite promptly after being offered a new drink concoction while waiting for our table. After looking over the menu for 20 minutes, i decided on the Grilled Chicken and Baked Brie sandwich with a bowl of clam chowder. For the clam chowder lovers out there, I swear they have the best clam chowder EVER. It's chunky and perfectly creamy. There are tons of veggies and potato and clams. A big bowl of yummy-ness. My sandwich was delish! The apple in it was crunchy yet perfectly cooked. The fig jam and the brie compliment each other perfectly. My boyfriend had the chicken tacos. Those looked pretty yummy. I admire him for having something different when we go out, where as I usually stick with ordinary things, but I was proud of myself last night!! I ordered as raspberry margarita which was... quite large. And yummy! Sweet and a little sour at the same time. We had the pumpkin pie for dessert and when it came out I was shocked. I swear they give you a slice that looks like it's about a 1/4 of the entire pie!!! It was so good. It tasted homemade and I want to make one that tastes exactly like it since it's my favorite pie :)    Overall Earls was a great experience. My only complaint was our waitress was a little... MIA?? I liked her though because we own the same dress from French Connection LOL. And there was a homeless guy outside that was a little intimidating. I wouldn't have felt safe if I was with girlfriends because we watched him go after a group of three girls till they got in their car"}
{"text":"Ok, so seriously... Amy is the most amazing server! She made me try new things that are amazing! My experience was just fantabulous because of her. She such a nice girl and is great towards her customers."}
{"text":"Last weekend when it was gorgeous outside but still a cold, crisp early-spring day, we had a family brunch at Earl's. I've passed by this Financial District hot-spot for years, admiring the patio but retreating from the annoying drunken bankers who swarm to the spot.   So the best way to avoid all that? Sunday brunch!  We made a reservation and arrived just as they opened, and within 1 minute of looking at the menu I knew what I wanted. Lobster and prawn brioche? Yes please. Whiskey and lemon cocktail? PERFECT.   The Lobster and Prawn brioche came super quickly with a side helping of fries and aioli. The brioche was perfect, doughy and warm and the lobster and prawn mix was cool, refreshing and with just a hint of cilantro. I washed it down with my whiskey-lemon cocktail while everybody else dug into the roast chicken with tomatilla sauce, the Earl's burgers and steaks. I didn't try anybody else's dish but it was clear mine was the clear winner.     In terms of the atmosphere, the interior of Earl's is really plush, the seats are comfortable but classy and even the washrooms are chic. The only thing that is offputting is the hostesses outfits. I'm no prude, but the dress code for servers and bartenders seemed to be American Apparel miniskirts and thin tank tops only. It felt a little incongruous with the restaurant. I wasn't expecting to see so much skin at brunch  Maybe that's why it's such a popular hangout for post-work drinks? Regardless, the staff were very nice, efficient, and helpful.   All in all, great meal, great drinks. My total came to $24 pre-tax and tip, which for this place? Isn't bad at all."}
{"text":"Service was great. Very attentive. We arrived after shopping and after 9:00pm there is special. We forgot it was only 8:40, the waiter prompt us and reminded us we can wait until later.  The clam chowder soup was so tasty. Lots of clams!!!! I've ordered the large portion and the waiter took initiative to split the soup into two separate bowls.  The fish taco was good, but on the colder side. The coconut shrimp, I find it okay as it was a little too sweet. I didn't like he avocado toast as I find too much lemon juice in it. But I will be back for the clam chowder and fish taco when I am shopping at Square one again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, especially when patio is open.  Food is good, but requires more of a gourmet touch.  Staff is polite although servers should be more opinionated when helping read the menu.  This spot is great for after work. Fabulous wine list.  Will most likely recommend to others."}
{"text":"Food is good. Decent beer list. Service was great. Nice atmosphere. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Where are the toppings on my Santa Fe blackened chicken salad?  Not ok, Earl, not ok.  I ordered this because I like filling, yet carb-light meals at restaurant chains, and I'd really enjoyed this at a Calgary Earls last year (I've been to a hell of a lot of Earlses in my deeper past, but almost never in recent years). In fact, I was almost embarrassed to claim I'd eaten \"salad\" because of the other ingredients - avocado chunks, black beans, corn and feta. So much topping that it threatened the fine balance between greens and extras... uncommonly thrilling for a mostly straightforward, mostly suburban restaurant chain. Plus, it was Earls that first introduced California / Southwestern cuisine to Western Alberta so many decades ago, where nary an avocado had ever graced the lips and where tortilla chips were nibbled with reverence as if shards of Moses' sacred tablets. By ordering the Santa Fe chicken, I felt I was paying respect to Earls' deep past while partaking of its present.  NOT SO IN TORONTO. The chicken and lettuce were respectable, the dressing was tasty, but the TINY portion of avocado I got was not properly ripe (still on the rubbery-crunchy side) and I eventually came across only one fingernail-sized morcel of feta. Like a crazed prospector digging for nuggets, I lauded myself for upturning a pathetic bounty of about 5 black beans and 4 kernels of corn!  On the brighter side, this Earls featured the Beau's Full Time IPA which was delicious and cold in those massively heavy Earls pint glasses.  This venue is fine, good for big groups, even when it's busy, and the service was really excellent for such a gigantic place. There's a huge patio, a dining room and a massive lounge with huge high tables and big sports screens if that's your jam."}
{"text":"We came here for some drinks and fries. They have plenty of daily specials especially on Sundays and Mondays. Sangria's are very tasty. Their fries looks and taste a lot like McDonalds fries (not complaining, I like McDonalds fries). Nice patio outside. Wonderful service. Free WiFi."}
{"text":"Had a late dinner last night 9:00 and the place was bustling with people. Lots of young trendy professionals having dinner and drinks. Food was good, great selection of beverages and the service was attentive without being intrusive.   Would go back to try some other items on their menu.   I had the sushi and steak. 8/10. Great taste, large portion."}
{"text":"Good food and awesome vibe. One of my go to spots in TO's financial district. Good service and fair prices. Fun times."}
{"text":"Food is just ok, very small menu with not many options.  Portions are not big and food is passable, nothing great especially for prices they charge. Good atmosphere to go for drinks, pretty loud in there was hard to have a conversation with my friends while eating.  Wouldn't go there again for dinner maybe for a drink and appetizer"}
{"text":"When I walk into this earls I am met at the door by 4 young girls all dressed in black VERY short skirts and stiletto heels.  Lovely young girls, well meaning but seemingly unaware that earl is exploiting them.  These girls are servers, hostesses and bartenders... god bless them, but they can do better than work here. OK that is my rant about the girls....Having said that lets talk about the restaurant. I was surprised at how nice it was inside this particular location. Dark woods, lots of booths and multi level seating. Our server and service was very good, certainly no complaints.  I chose the Penne Alfredo as I feeling particularly sinful and it was delicious creamy cheesy and very rich  I later found it online it was 1523 calories. Holy crap!  It was good though.  My friend had a summer salad thing with Shrimp and she loved hers as well, it looked very colorful and fresh.  I was pleased that most of the items could be made vegetarian, which I did.  I mentioned the stiletto  heel thing to my server as  I noticed she had on flat shoes. she told me that she wouldn't wear stilletos anymore having fallen in the kitchen. I challenge any man to wear stilletos running around in a restaurant for 8 hours....no doubt these kids are being paid minimum wage plus tips, so they at least should be able to be comfortable and safe while working.  Ok rant number 2 is over.  There is lots of parking outside for Earls and the prices are reasonable, my meal plus tip came to seventeen bucks.  Overall this is a decent place to eat, but if you are a woman working there, probably a pain in the arches."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks and dinner during the Victoria Day long weekend and Earl's has earned themselves a loyal customer to-be! At first we were out on the patio and nobody even bothered to greet us/give us menus etc. so we moved inside to the bar. We met the Australian bartender who was really friendly and immediately started engaging us in conversation and suggesting some menu items.  The food was amazing honestly and to this day, I'm still thinkin' about it. We started off with the dynamite roll which was BOMB. I had the chicken, brie + fig sandwich with truffle fries *drool*, and my bf had the cajun chicken + ribs. I'm hoping other locations are just as good for times it's not convenient to venture out DT. Otherwise, Earl's you will be seeing us again :)"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch during a break at work and was not dissapointed.  The service was prompt, the price was acceptable for the quality of the meals and the menu was well diverse.  I had a very enjoyable  and interestingly flavourful  burger. My partner (work not other half) had an Asian type stirfy and was also appearing fond of it. The waitress realized my parner and I had not had a break in many long hours and kept the soft drinks and water coming for us, which was also very much apreciated considering she did it with a smile the whole time.   The only caution for this establishment is the availability of parking but that is an easy fix.  I will gladly return to this location given the opportunity."}
{"text":"Great clam chowder and warm kale salad. The women working there  are both beautiful and nice. I am a woman traveling alone on business, and received great service."}
{"text":"This was an expensive version of Moxie's. The food was ok, my dining companions and I ordered sandwiches. Normal right?!? Well it cost 13.95 and if you wanted a salad instead of fries you had to add a dollar. Everyone else just give you the options! This I'd pay for dinner entrees in this type of place but for lunch it seems a little much.  The chicken and brie sandwich I ordered was a bit sweet. It had baked apple slices and fig jam on spinach. It was suppose to be agrula but it tasted like baby spinach. I also had the white sangria, which was ok. It had fresh fruit as a described, but was missing the peaches. Ok, but I won't be going back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Really trying for something modern but seems like a flop! Canopy covering natural sunlight. Food was good until my friend found a hair in his fries. Served a soup without a spoon and yet all the serves were still somewhat attentive and working hard to pleased a full house"}
{"text":"Went for brunch happy hour with my girlfriends at the 16th Ave location and to our surprise it really was $8 for all brunch mains.  It really was a steal! I had the Chorizo + Mushroom hash and the Chocolate Banana Cream Waffle to share.  The chorizo + mushroom came with two eggs that were cooked perfectly to a soft boil.  The hollandaise sauce seems to be lacking a pinch of salt and I had some pieces of the avocados had gone bad.  My friends didn't have the same issue with the avocados so maybe I was just unlucky.  Overall, for me the lack of salt in the eggs balanced well with the saltiness from the chorizo however I do tend to eat less salt these days. The chocolate banana cream waffles were so delicious! It was the highlight of my brunch. I usually have issues with the level of sweetness.  But these were Aaaa-MaZing! I will definite be coming back to try the rest of their brunch menu."}
{"text":"There were 20 of us and we were treated well.  Drinks were good- I had pineapple and ginger margarita, not served in margarita glass- a bit disappointing.  I had a ceasar salad- could taste anchovy, good portion and good amount of cheese. but presentation was not so appealing.  Had dungess crab and shript linguini- a bit too salty and wish there was more seafood.  All in all, great service and everybody enjoyed their food. Especially, vegetarians in our groups enjoyed the cauliflower soup and grilled veggie quesaddilas."}
{"text":"The reason for this rating was due to the poor service received for our large group. It was my first time at this restaurant and I had reservations with my coworkers.  We arrived around 12:30pm and didn't receive our food until approximately 2pm. The appetizers arrived way in advance, as I watched people who were seated after us have their meals brought to their table prior to ours. One of my coworkers, unfortunately, did not receive his order due to a mix-up in the kitchen, so he asked for it to be packed to-go. We were all fed up with the timing of our food given that it was a \"work lunch\" - we had to get back to the office.  However, our waitress was kind enough to compensate us for the miscommunication. Sometimes things happen!  As for the overall food: - Chicken tacos! (3.5/5) - Dynamite Roll (4/5) - Spinach Dip (4/5)  Layout of the restaurant was dainty and spacious, appeared to be upscale as well because majority of the customers were decked out in their finest outfits!  I wouldn't say it will be my last time here, but I do recommend going with a small group or have a date night! (NOT LARGE PARTIES)."}
{"text":"Eh really sums up my review.   Afterwork is always packed. Good luck trying to get a reservation. My suggestion, put your name down and then stalk the lounge. You might get seated right away and they have the same service... Although if you want to pick up, you'll have to go to the main dining area... but really, if you are picking up here, there are so many better places to go... really.  Service I find is generally decent. Sometimes a little too happy for me but everyone tends to be a certain size and blonde so that's a plus for some people.   Drinks are average. Their list is neither poor nor exemplary. It just is. So if you are a wine-o, try a real wine bar.  Food. Average upper middle-class pub. I do like their steaks but it really is the mashed potatoes that is the carb-winner. I'm sure there's a lot of butter in it but hey, you're having steak! And the menu always says seasonal vegetables but the 5-6 times I've ordered steak, it has always been asparagus. Always.  They have a tuna sushi salad - it's a deconstructed salad and pretty kick ass as far as presentation and a mixture of flavours. Then again, I'm Asian, I approve all things rice.  Was there last night and had the bigger better burger. It wasn't bigger. It's angus cut but I found the burger thin and dry. I enjoyed the pickle. The side salad was neat, had sweet peas and a champagne vinagrette, worth the extra $1.50.  Keep eating! Oh and Bacon rules the world but you are reading reviews so you know that already."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with the family tonight. Food was tasty and our waiter was very friendly and tentative. Bar service was slow...that's why I did not rate it a 5. Will try it again"}
{"text":"Earls is located in the financial district so it's always crowded. Earls is one of my go-to for happy hour drinks. I love the atmosphere over there.  Service is always friendly and efficient. We ordered BBQ Ribs And Cajun Chicken and I loved their warm potato salad which comes with the chicken."}
{"text":"The food is really good. Like the BBQ ribs and blackened cajun chicken are to die for. One of my favourite things to order. The toffee pudding is amazing as well! If it's your first time, you must try the above mentioned.   The food is always good but we must not score when it comes to service. The service is always not the greatest. I barely see my servers to the point I forget what they look like. It's really annoying when I need something and they are nowhere to be found in the restaurant. Another issue I have they always seem to add the coleslaw on even when I ask them for something else in place of coleslaw, because I can't eat coleslaw due to allergies. However, when I get my food- there is coleslaw! Those are my huge issue with this location. The 2 stars is because the food is just that good.  If they continue with this type of service I may have to go without Earls until they change their ways."}
{"text":"We went here after the jays game let out and I'm so glad we did! They are one of those restaurants that can handle the rush!  Our server was extremely friendly and knowledgeable on all the dishes. She recommended two dishes and we went with them. Amazing dishes!  I ordered the 7 oz sirloin with peppercorn and Caesar salad. The caesar dressing is made in house and is amazing!! The peppercorn glaze is so good. We also ordered the half combo of ribs and chicken. That is my favourite dish off the menu so far. Even though I've only had two dishes haha.  Definitely come here and try it out! If you can ask for Crystal- she was good."}
{"text":"I love this Earl's.  It's so glittery and totally out of keeping with the area.  This is a great spot to meet old friends for a few drinks."}
{"text":"Earl's is as good a place as any to grab a burger and a pint.  It's a reasonable spot."}
{"text":"I've tried all the restaurants in the area except Earl's, it was time. My first impression of this place was quite positive. The interior was very nicely designed and we were offered a free sample cocktail by the hostess, not a bad way to wait! We got our table after about 15-20 minutes and we're seated at what seemed an awkward location in the restaurant. The way the tables are set up is quite strange but quite common downtown: tables for 4 set up with a connected 2 seater cushioned bench on each side. Each of these benches is set up back to back with another bench. It was interesting, but I can imagine how some people would want a bit more privacy. Our waiter came quite quickly but was not very present for the rest of the night. He didn't really check to see if we needed anything or if everything was okay with our meals after bringing them, and we rarely saw him in general. But I can't say he didn't do a good job either way, just some things to consider. I ordered the chicken and pancetta pasta with an elderflower soda (amazing) The food was flavourful and fresh and had a very interesting mix of tastes which I enjoyed. Unfortunately my friend got the Alfredo with prawns and would have liked a bit more Alfredo (this is where it would've been useful if the waiter had come by to check up after we got our meals).  We actually wanted dessert today! Shocker. But unfortunately Earl's only offers 3 desserts, none of which seemed to hit the spot (a new York cheesecake could have been right on the money) so we ended up going to a cafe in Maple after to satisfy our sweet tooth.  Overall definitely not a bad experience! I'll definitely be back, and hopefully next time we'll be able to address any concerns with our server a bit better."}
{"text":"Met a friend and colleague here after a long work day ! Love Earls ! Fantastic service from the second you walk in the door ! Outstanding menu that makes you want to come back and try other items from the truffle fries (which by the way are the best French Fries I've ever had to wonderful steaks ! Tonight we opted for the Brie Sandwich and the Royal Burger and of course both with Truffle Fries.....great service, great food ! Thank Earl"}
{"text":"This was my first ever visit to Earls, and I highly doubt I'll return.  The decor was nice, and I can't speak to the drinks, but the food was subpar at best.  I ordered the spinach 3 cheese dip appetizer to share with my table and the fish tacos with fries as my main.  The spinach dip was okay, but I've made better at home. The fish tacos were utterly bland and flavourless. There wasn't a spec of salt on fried cod, and some of it was extremely mushy too, like the texture of undercooked frozen fish sticks. The slaw was barely dressed.  The generic hot sauce they used wouldn't be out of place at a Taco Bell.  Other guests at my table complained that their food was too salty.  Most plates were largely unfinished by the time we left.  Our server was professional and polite, but she also disappeared for 20-30 minutes at a time. To be fair, it was a busy Saturday night and they seemed to be very understaffed."}
{"text":"Earl's is a great hangout at the base of a tall office building, you might not expect it to be there. The outdoor area is surrounded by glass to keep the wind at bay. Upscale couches, heaters for when the weather is cool, and pretty waitstaff make it a fun place to get drinks. The food sounds fantastic on the menu and looks perfect when it arrives but it tastes just okay, not sure why. Fun drinks on the menu. The only con is that you're outside and you'll get smokers."}
{"text":"So good and amazing service! We're from Baltimore and really lucky to have found this place. It's easily one of the best restaurants we've ever been to. We got the burger, bibimbap (get this!!), and curry. All were delicious and $5 margaritas was a plus."}
{"text":"Food was alright but certainly not outstanding. The convenient location is probably the deciding factor. I tried the chicken tacos and clam chowder. It was ok. The service was good.   Come here with coworkers for drinks and a bite after work but expect to shout to be heard. The noise level is always on high."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now - once for an office social and another for my friend's birthday. Overall, the service and food at Earls is consistent and I always leave with a full stomach and satisfied!    I recommend their steaks for sure - grilled nicely and chewy. Their spaghettis are also very nicely cooked with the just the right amount of sauce to compliment the noodles. Their selection of seafood for their seafood Alfredo spaghetti is diverse and fresh. Highly recommended for sure.  In terms of drinks, I love their \"Bees Knees\" and also their regular mojito. Solid choice for dinner around the downtown area for an affordable price."}
{"text":"Preface: This review reads like a complete compli-sult, but I'm having trouble conveying my solid Earls experience. Like if you found out that song you really like was actually Nickleback... but nowhere near that bad! I'm sorry Earls, there's no way you deserve and analogy that harsh. Ready? Here we go.  Wait, this is an Earls? My oh my how the once burger joint has evolved over the years. I'll have to admit, when a friend suggested Earls, I was all over my Yelp app trying to find somewhere else in mission that could take a group of 9 for some relaxed drinks at 10:30pm on Friday. No such luck. Colour me surprised, Earls, you've got quite the swanky joint.  They've got a bit of a cocktail list going on now. Several friends opted for the $7 single oz mojitos and enjoyed them. I managed to sneak a few sips and liked it. A classic mojito done nicely with some very impressive fresh mint sprigs.  I grabbed an old fashioned that they make with root beer bitters instead of angostura bitters. I was really excited to not only see an old fashioned on the menu, but a creative take on one, none the less. I appreciate the fresh approach, but I learned there's no messing with an old fashioned. I'll go without the root beer bitters next time.  Our server was a total gem. (I can't remember her name, sorry Earls. She's a transplant from another earls who by this point would have been working there for a few weeks. Kendra? Anyway...) I was impressed by all the staff. Everyone was exceptionally friendly and even though the place is huge and was crowded, as soon as I stood up and looked confused there was someone there to take care of me. There's some serious quality and consistency that goes into this restaurants staff training that making me rethink my opinion of the entire chain.  The people there definitely don't strike me as being on the adventurous side, but it definitely didn't seem as... I don't know... Suburban domestic(?) as I thought it would.   While Earls still isn't my first pick to meet up in Mission, it's no longer my last. I feel it's more of a deep seeded want to hang out at local places instead of chains that makes me go elsewhere. The place is chill and funky, our service was great and the drinks were drinkable."}
{"text":"It took the waitress half an hour to bring my tea. I was watching how they served the other tables and the service is very slow in general. He food is ok"}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday for a quick drink and bite to eat with a friend. Our server Emma was lovely. I really like the atmosphere and the food was tasty. We both had the portobello burger and fries. The fries are great and the burger tasted fresh. The food came quickly and the patio is a great environment. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Honestly I think earls is kind of underrated sometimes they have some interesting things on their menu and it surprises me and other times it's just a miss. They have a great fusion of cuisines which is wonderful.   This location had terrible service I must say. We were standing around for a good 15 mins before someone actually acknowledged us. The food made up a little bit for that though. Kind of pricey though."}
{"text":"If your single, you might like this location. I walked over to the lounge section to use the washroom and it was whoah - meet market! I felt like I was trespassing - crossing into this foreign world.  Decently priced wines by the glass. Service was very good. We sampled a pizza (okay but bland and scant on toppings) and the spinach dip, which looked ugly but tasted good. I would hit this place up for drinks but I prefer other chains (Cactus/Joeys) for food."}
{"text":"Just say no. Where to start... The hosts I suppose. Firstly, being on your phone (both of them) as guests enter your establishment is not professional. Nor is being absent from the entrance as guests enter your establishment (the hosts were in the kitchen, again being entertained by their smart phones). Next, the service or lack thereof. It takes forever for any wait staff to come around, take an order, then for the food to be served. My party ate earlier and their food also took a long time. I ordered a basic item. 30 minutes after ordering a burger the food appeared. I was pretty sure they had forgotten that I had ordered anything. Burger was missing condiments, so to make it simple for them I put in a request for just one condiment. First request and 20 minutes later nothing (the girl never came back to the table), second request with our actual waitress another 10 minute wait. Waiting and waiting until the food inevitably became cold. Definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Just this past Monday I heard of the new Earls.67 restaurant on Stephen Avenue. I also heard about their new compensation model - the fixed 16% gratuity.  First, the gratuity is NOT mandatory - Earls never said that. The media did, along with a bunch of half-cocked, pissed off, people like me... ooops. Sorry Earls.  At first, I was like, \"What the hell? You're taking away my choice to tip?\"  After a lot of passionate debate back and forth about this issue on Facebook and LinkedIn, I ended up on a phone call with Craig Blize - VP of Operations.   Following the great (and very patient) call with Craig, I headed straight to Earls.67 for lunch (last Wednesday) and let me tell you, my opinion shifted from \"no way\" to a \"hell yes\".  I came in at 1:30. The place still buzzing from late lunchers. I was seated quickly and within 3m 17s (I timed my entire experience - I know, such a nerd eh)  5:00 - My drink order was taken.  7:30 - a server stopped by to take my order. We chatted quite a bit when I realised she, Christina, was a trainer who flew in from Toronto - her first trip to Calgary. Welcome!  23:00 My order arrived, the zucchini salad (w/no feta) and a chicken breast - just like I asked for. I enjoyed my meal a lot. Took my time. Wrote a few notes regarding a speech I'm giving in a weeks time.   I also did a lot of people watching. From what I could see, everyone was enjoying themselves, their lunch dates, and the food.  Two different servers checked on me during my meal. Thank you.  41:00 I finish my meal and push the plate aside. Within seconds, a passing server grabs my empty plate and asks how everything was. \"Fantastic, thank you.\"  44:00 I ask my server for the bill before he can ask if I wanted dessert - I have a weakness for dessert so I'm trying to avoid being asked. LOL  45:00 I pay my bill. $21.71 including the 16% gratuity and gst.   It's now that I ask the server (Grayson) about the whole 16% tip/gratuity program. We chatted for close to five minutes. I learned a lot.   \"There's no more competition,\" he says, \"We're not fighting over who has more tables. We just focus on the customer. Before, you'd likely only meet your own server and/or a food runner. While they served you, they're keeping an eye on how many other tables the other servers have in comparison, and if the Hostess is fairly distributing the customers. Now, that doesn't matter anymore. We can focus on the customer's experience.  What I took from that conversation was a shift in mindset... it wasn't competition, but rather scarcity. The traditional tipping model promoted competition among the servers and a scarcity mindset. The new model promotes the opposite, an abundance mindset through teamwork.  We chatted about other things including the perception of the 16% gratuity. \"I've only had positive feedback,\" he said.  After enjoying my own experience as much as I did, I can see why.  After first hearing about this new compensation model (aka: tipping system), i was against the idea. Not anymore.  Having experienced Earls.67 first hand, I'm an ADVOCATE.  4 Stars. Why not 5? It's a new restaurant, as great as my experience was it was still a little glitchy from a systematisation and customer flow point of view which is understandable considering they've just opened... However the food, the service - 5 stars"}
{"text":"Not my first time at Earls but my first time here. In TO (from Calgary) for work related reasons and wanted to get out of the hotel... go for a stroll and enjoy some night life.   Earls and the friendly staff didn't disappoint.   I sat in the lounge instead of the restaurant mainly because I didn't want to wait the 10m for a table - I was hungry.  I'm a fan of the Santa Fe chicken salad... so let's have it. But first, a dynamite roll. If your familiar with the Earls menu, everything tasted great and as expected - just like it would have tasted in Calgary. A little short on wasabi & Ginger by the way...   Lots of TVs to watch sports - Phoenix is in town playing the Leafs. Comfortable chairs and booths. Free wifi too - who knew?  My server is Christine... She has a few cool tattoos, all of which tell an interesting story (I have tattoos too so I always like to ask and learn their story).   All in all, a very positive experience and a great place to people watch.   Thanks Team Earls."}
{"text":"Usually dont review chains, as menus are the same across the province/country. But I had the Cajun blackened chicken with coleslaw and warm potato salad (asked for the garlic butter to be left out). Chicken was nice and juicy (never frozen and not over cooked). coleslaw creamy, but the potato salad, wow. Chopped baked potato (skin on, previously cooked) with corn and a creamy sauce that was excellent."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant a few times in the past with mediocre results.    Service was slow which is usually the case here although they are friendly.  I had salmon which was flavourful and moist.  Unfortunately the rice was cold and the veggies seemed to be frozen and perhaps microwaved.  The most stunning part of our dinner was the fact that they have no kids menu.  At all.  They are located in a major mall filled with people and their kids and they have zero on their menu for kids.  The meal we got for our grandson was $25 and he ate a small portion.  We scoured the appetizers for something he could eat but there really wasn't anything.  If you have kids I would recommend you pass on this restaurant.  They obviously do not want families to dine here."}
{"text":"Wish I could give them a zero. This restaurant has the worst service of all time. I waited for an hour to be served and another hour to get my food, after complaining multiple times. Some of my friends still haven't been served after two hours. We were served bottles of San Pelligrino without glasses, our water is now warm and we asked for the glasses 5 times. I will never be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is good for a get together with some friends on a friday nite...no one comes here to have a 5-star dinner....the atmosphere is hip, music is loud, pretty waitress....blah blah blah....its a good hangout for 20-30 somethings or guys who like to gawk at pretty girls... lols."}
{"text":"i would return just for drinks, the atmosphere is very nice trendy, and bar selection great- However menu selection not the best"}
{"text":"Earls was terrific. Great lively atmosphere. Loud. Food - sushi was great along with Caesar salad. Had the mushroom steak another night and it was good as well. Service was outstanding. Lots of your professionals frequent the place."}
{"text":"Weekend Brunch review: Earls just promoted their new \"happy hour\" brunch which is from 11am-12pm where all their brunch menu(6 options) are $8 each! plus brunchie beverages for $5!   We beat the rush and got our food in a timely manner. Service was great but noticed it got really busy and food started coming out late for tables after us.   Good value and quality! Even the basic eggs and bacon combo with home fries is cheaper than Panagio or Coras. The avocado toast is bomb and worth the $8. sides are $2-$3 each, you could even make your own plate with prices that cheap  I think for a limited time, they offer fresh orange juice and coffee at the door while people wait for their tables which is nice."}
{"text":"I'm still shaking my head at a recent experience at this Earl's.  It was after the dinner rush, and the place was empty.  It took 15 minutes to get a waitress to acknowledge us, despite walking by several times and fixing tables adjacent to us, and only having one other table to attend to.  After finally taking our drink order and giving us menus to look over it took another 15 minutes before the waitress returned, with flat beer by the way.  My friend ordered quesadillas and the waitress gave her chop sticks....  We both laughed about if for hours in and still can't figure out why in her right mind the waitress would give out chop sticks for quesadillas.  I didn't even know Earl's had chopsticks!!  Then the waitress returned again saying the tap was being changed.....  15 more minutes later she comes back saying they've had problems all night with the beer.....  so if that is the case then why even let me order it and wait 30 minutes or more.... just tell me and let me order something else.  The food was okay, by the time it came I think so much time had gone by we even forgot what we ordered and that we were starving.  Good for a laugh, but don't go there if you're thirsty or hungry...."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a whim for lunch since it was on our way back to our hotel. It was bustling so I figured it must be a popular place! Inside it's kind of sexy and very popular among the working crowd. First thing I noticed was all the beautiful men and women...gorgeous crowd and classy servers. Being very busy service was quick and very pleasant. Our waiter was this tall gentlemen who looked like he could be on the cover of Vogue magazine! Food was magnificent! The Quinoa Powerbowl was probably the best salad I have ever had. Healthy, delicious and filling. The Salmon Filet fish was also wonderful. Flavorful and even the rice was something special. So far it's been our favorite meal in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Decided to go here for a quick bite, it was around 3:30, and not overly busy. We were sat upon entering the building, and we patiently waited for about five minutes as none of the three waiters/waitresses walking by stopped at our table. The room was fairly empty for the exception of a fairly large party seated in the centre of the room-which was obviously getting all the attention. Thinking they will come over within the next couple minutes we waited for fifteen more minutes and still no one had shown up to offer us any drinks or even a greeting. I noticed that the manager also seemed to be standing in the next room over with three other employees just talking instead of actually looking around to see if his staff was taking care of customers. One star because it's absolutely ridiculous that I have to sit in a restaurant for 20 minutes without anyone noticing us. Will NEVER go back here again.  Edit: I was contacted by the manager of the location with the request that I email her and she would figure something out because of what happened, and it's been an entire week and still no response. Terrible."}

{"text":"I'm a fan of Earl's. They have yummy food, high customer-service standards. They have a decent number of Gluten-Free options as well.  Personally, I almost always get the Hunan Kung Pao. It's awesome. I get several hot peppers added and as them to burn them slightly as it reduces the potency of the spice a notch."}
{"text":"I have attended most of Earl's locations in Alberta and Saskatchewan. The 16th Ave location fits in well. Well decorated, very good service and yummy food. Parking can be a little weird, but typically it's fine, especially once you get the hang of how this location's setup.  My biggest point of confusion with Earl's in general remains a lacking support for Gluten-free options. They do have SOME basic accommodation. I wish they had GF buns at least for their burgers, but not so. My wife and I both have developed Gluten issues and our needs often dictate where the group goes, so good GF options can kind of have a large impact. Anyways, Earl's handles us well enough."}
{"text":"Earl's is a chain restaurant.  Let's just get that out there right off the bat.  Located, tucked in the financial district, this place is rather nicely done in terms of decor and ambience.  The patio is spacious, as is the bar area, and as well, so it should be, given the location and the competition it faces to garner the clientele it attracts.  I'd opt for a visit here more for after work drinks than I would the food, however, that would depend on what your preferences are.  Also, perhaps your profession, as it seems, there are suits a plenty packed in here on a happening Thursday night.  I was here on a Wednesday.  With my Mom.  And two aunts.  None of us had on a suit.    As for the food, not bad, for a chain.  Less adventure, more safety, great predictability, the menu offers up a solid fare, and provides a good mix of options for the more conservative eater.   The tuna nachos are a nice surprise app, however, the fish tacos do not dazzle.  Although my dining companions on this occasion did thoroughly enjoy their food, I doubt I'd rush back to sample more of it.  If only the dinner offerings were as attractive as the staff serving it, would I be.  3 stars, firm."}
{"text":"Awful service. Took over 30 mins for drinks. Another 30 for food (that was cold). Server never checked on the food or asked us if we wanted another drink. We sat for 10 mins with completely empty plates and drinks. Server literally walked by, saw our table and said \"oh krap\" AND still didn't come back for 5 mins to clean our plates. For someone who worked at earls for almost 2 years and know why is expected, this did not live up to expectations at all. One more thing, managers were wandering around chatting the entire time and walked by our table numerous times without checking in or helping. Tisk tisk earls."}
{"text":"Came here with about 13 other people. We were seated very quickly on the patio. We ordered two pitchers of margaritas... one lime and one raspberry. Tasty, however, I was not a fan of the raspberry one and I've definitely had better.  I ordered the grilled salmon with jasmine rice and green beans. Fantastic flavour. The dried onions on the jasmine rice was a very nice touch. When the waiter was bringing out everyone's meal, I was told that my meal was 5-10 minutes behind and that I wold receive it shortly. It came 10 mins after everyone else's meal and they ended up giving me the entire meal for free since it was delayed. It was an awfully nice thing to do! Service was fantastic especially for such a large group of people. Loved the atmosphere. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"It's my first time here and upon entrance I'm impressed by the ambiance--lots of dim lighting everywhere, lots of booths to sit in, nice large windows overlooking King St W., and overall a very chill environment.   We just came here to drink so I had the raspberry mojito and it was so good that I ordered a couple more.  Our server was also really friendly and attentive.   Not much else to say as we were only there for drinks but I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Came here today with my boyfriend and his family. The wait time was decent but we didn't eat in the dining room we ended up getting a table in the bar area, which was totally fine by me !  I got the jerk chicken which was very delicious and came with two whole chicken breasts, rice, beans, and warm coleslaw, which is not bad for the price ($20). The food came nice and hot, and I enjoyed my dinner !  By bf got the Korean chicken wings (not pictured) and I had a few and they were absolutely delicious, tbh I wish i got this instead lol!  Overall dining experience was okay, our waitress was very attentive and our food came out quick. For dessert we got the cheesecake, which my bf and I agreed, was phenomenal.  The only thing that we weren't happy about was the dirty fork that we got. Also the music was super loud and I feel like we were all yelling over the music.  Other than that we had a great time and really enjoyed our food !"}
{"text":"Worst service. Or should I say no service at all. Walked in with 9 people after a movie and just waited while waitresses walked by. No clean tables available in the bar area. Helped ourselves to the patio and still no clean tables and even if there were any I doubt any waitresses would notice and come serve us. We walked straight out the patio and right into moxies next door; service and table right away."}
{"text":"The staff barely acknowledge you but the food is okay...... better options and service at Jack's or Moxies which are in the same area."}
{"text":"Wow so I'm late on this review but Just remembered what amazing time me and my friends had. Earls is such a warm and inviting place with such an amazing staff. We went twice and my friends raved about the Fettuccini Alfredo, I had the spicy Korean wings and they're also delicious. Although the food is absolutely amazing, as is the drinks, it was the staff that made the experience absolutely exceptional. During my first visit, we had Cat as our server and she was amazing,extremely sweet, and helpful. She did an amazing job serving us but an even better job helping us figure out where we could have fun in Toronto, which we really appreciated. Avi the manager was amazing as well ad came and checked onus to see if our night was going well, which we thought was just the icing on the cake because the dinner had went great. When we came back the second time due the exceptional service,we had Meera was our server. She was so attentive and helpful.Service was quick and the food was delicious. One of the highlights of my Toronto trip for sure!"}
{"text":"Got hair in our food twice in one setting and got no apology. Waited for the manager for 20 mins to show up, just for her to tell us she thinks it's not their fault. Never coming here again.  *bad service exception of our waitress  *shitty food (burger was so dry and salty, tbh McDonald's does it better"}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner with the family. Our sever was polite and was able to explain the menu well. The food came out quick and was good. I really enjoyed there clam chowder. The restaurant was clean but it was a bit too noisy with all the people."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant/bar a month ago after the arcade fire concert. After asking our concierge at the hotel where the nearest bar was he pointed us just a few blocks down the street. There was a group of 5 of us and we were all pleasantly surprised.  Especially because we expected  to find a dive bar. Earl's is far from that. Once you walk in you realize you are in a more trendy upscale bar that has a kitchen open late. Which is RARE! This was surprising because we probably did not arrive to earl's until 12:30am on a weekday and their kitchen was still taking orders.   The food was all tasty but a little overpriced for what you are getting. Me and my boyfriend decided to split the sweet potato fries thinking that it would be a nice snack. This unfortunately was not the case. Yes they were delicious however the portion sizes were so small. For $8.50 you would think you would get a basket of fries not a small handful cone size container that each person would get only 8 fries or so.    Since the fries were small, we ordered another appetizer. This was also small.  Maybe 3 bites worth for each person. In total the bill ended up costing over $30 dollars for 2 beers and 2 small portioned appetizers. We left hungry.   Although I did not care for the food pricing, I would recommend Earl's for drinks. The drinks were reasonably priced and the atmosphere was truly delightful. I will definitely go back for drinks on the patio sometime in the summer if I end up in that area."}
{"text":"The crowd was a good mixture of people younger and older but the drinks are super weak and the waitress that we had, basically didn't get any of the orders right and when she did, it took forever. I feel like this place deserves another shot, especially because it's so close to where I am staying, but meh..."}
{"text":"Earls is located in the financial district so the crowd consists of the working class! Ladies?!?!? An ideal place to be as there are a lot of suits LoL! Anyways back to the focus of this review! I was promptly seated, service was quick, my waitress Dana was fun and very assertive as she always checked in, in a timely manner. Today is Wednesday so I took advantage of their \"Wings Wednesday\" special. I chose the Korean spicy wings which were nice in size (didn't look like they were on steroids!!!) with the perfect amount of sauce which was absolutely delish.   The featured soup was Mexican inspired! A tomato based soup with avocado, corn, beans, pico gallo, sour cream with little pieces of tortilla! Omg so good! What else? My friend order the Ahi Tuna which I didn't get to try so I am assuming it was really good! All in all, for my first time here (which I am still here as I write) I had a great overall experience. The atmosphere is really dope, food is great and service equally great! I'll be sure to come back and try the rest of the menu! Until then....  5 stars for decor, atmosphere, food and service!"}
{"text":"It's just okay.  Average.  Nothing to really write about.  I had their smash burger.  Decent.  Margarita was terrible.  Please use fresh lime juice.  The marg was 10 dollars, that's the least you could do that using dime store lime mix.  Decent service and friendly, but they need to bring the food and drink up a notch...or two."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a few co-workers.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  My Tuna Cheddar Melt was fantastic and exceeded my expectation.  I also ordered a sleeve of Rhino beer which was on special for only $3.  The whole experience was delightful and I think I will go back, but next time during happy hour.  They have happy hour special everyday from 3 - 6 p.m."}
{"text":"We've been nearly two decade customers of Earls Westhills...we are regulars who have witnessed a few remodels and staff changes over the years.    Prior to the last remodel, the food was always predictably consistent and really good.  We've noticed in the last year the quality and presentation of the food is loosing steam.  Last night my husband and I ordered the Kale and Santa Fe salads.  My salad had way too much poorly washed, gritty kale in it.  There was exactly ONE brussel sprout in the salad and there were just a few cold potato crumbles in the dry and barely dressed kale.  My dinner companion's Santa Fe salad was a far cry from the beautifully presented eye catching Santa Fe salad of a few years ago.  A huge plate of gritty kale with barely any accompaniments and almost no dressing is a big disappointment.    We are big fans of the weekend biscuits...but for some reason they are not being baked til golden brown anymore...they are pale, under done and doughy.  The beautiful and delicious golden biscuits that we came for nearly every weekend are easy to skip right now.  Please bring back the rectangular platter you originally served the kale salad on with less kale that is well cleaned and loaded with brussel sprouts, potatoes and well dressed with browned butter dressing.  I hope Earls can regain presenting quality food with more eye pleasing detail.  It was disappointing to enjoy our appetizer and dessert but feel let down with our main courses."}
{"text":"I went on a weekend evening, and it was quite busy. I ordered a chicken taco, but received the fish taco, it tasted fine and I was hungry, so I didn't return it. It was also quite difficult to get a server."}
{"text":"The service was ok the food was awful. We occasionally come here for food and it keeps going down hill. We got the chilli chicken which is our favourite and we always get it and tonight it was terrible. It tasted so old and stale and it looked terrible. It's not the same anymore and this just confirmed that we won't be going back here anymore."}
{"text":"Waitresses are really friendly and the interior design is really cool. There are two sections bar and dinning area. The food is always fresh and delicious.  It's a really nice place for hanging out with co workers after work and have brunch with families or someone you love."}
{"text":"The girls here are HOT! That's right! I said it! And I said it to my husband a few times during dinner, too! He just kept laughing at me, amused. \"WHAT girls?\", he asks, staring deep into my eyes like no one else exists. \"Liar!\", I called him out! \"I know you've been staring too!\". He just widens his eyes and focuses on ME even MORE. Well trained, I thought!  The girls here are all dressed in sexy black dresses or uniform. All short & tight. And they all \"happen\" to be beautiful!  Oh right, I'm a fan of the food, here, too! I was in the mood for vegetarian, so I got the veggie quesadilla stuffed with zucchini & eggplant & peppers & oozing with cheddar cheese! It was excellent, and very tasty! I topped it off with the sweet potato fries (extra $2). But it was soooo worth it!  The sweet potato fries must have been baked in the same oil as the french fries because you could taste it! Deep fried to perfection! Crispy outside, and soft sweet potato filling that is not over fried! The husby got the steak & veggies and really liked his dish! Together our bill with tax & tip rang up as $75. Decent pricing.  Loved the all-wood panel ceiling, see-thru wall and the luxurious spotted leather booth seating. The pendant lighting by the window was a nice feature, and the bathrooms are dark, sleek and sexy!  Come to be allured by the food, the interior, and, ummm, the girls!"}
{"text":"First time in earls, great food and great service, lovely restaurant, well decorated, amazing place to spend with family and friends. Will come again for sure."}
{"text":"Great spot. Loved the drinks and it doesn't get better than Earls girls."}
{"text":"Since Earls Tin Palace re-opened, newly renovated post-floods, they definitely have a funkier vibe. The renovations are excellent, as was our service. We just went to have a drink at the bar during a mini pub crawl. The Old Fashioned was deeeelicious! Definitely a place I will come back to."}
{"text":"This place gets mediocre reviews partly because you only get good service if you're an investment banker wearing a Zegna suit. You're more likely to get killed by a terrorist than get a table there at lunch - unless you like to dine at 10am. Every time I go there around 11:30-11:45 to get a table for lunch, they're \"fully booked\" with reservations. Yet try calling to make a reservation and you're told they don't take them. Make up your friggen minds - I know you don't hire the brightest talent, but either you take reservations or you don't.  Beyond that, this is a good chain restaurant - the food is never terrible."}
{"text":"I don't know when Earls became a place to take your kids...it was a complete gong show on Sunday night.  I usually end up sitting in the lounge or patio because it's faster and there are NO kids! Not the case this weekend. We were surrounded by large groups...one with a screaming toddler, another with a crying baby, and another couple that let their baby walk without supervision around our table and breakables around the outdoor fireplace.  There were dirty looks galore...and not just from my table.   Now I get it that it's a long weekend and people want to go out to eat as a family...personally, I think there should be some segregation between the restaurant and lounge/patio.  If you're going to take your kids out...then you need to watch them! Be aware of other people who want to enjoy their evenings as well - some may have left their kids at home and were looking forward to a night without screaming and crying.   All ranting aside...you can count of Earls for consistently good food and drinks, and decent service."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend a few times, since it's his favorite place to get wings and ribs! The service is pretty good and it's always busy here, despite that, they get the food out decently quick. The ambiance is nice and they keep the lighting dim, but it can be pretty loud in here since there's a bar.   Our favorite thing to order is a full rack of baby back ribs with honey garlic wings. The portion size is big enough for both of us to split and still have some to bring home. They have to be the best ribs both of us have had, and is now my favorite place for them too. The wings here are bomb, too. The vodka shots are pretty expensive, $9.50 each. Didn't know when we first came so we ordered a few. That bill was spicy.   Their drinks are pretty good, too. I love their frozen pink lemonade! You can order it virgin if you don't drink alcohol or are underage."}
{"text":"Earls Tin Palace or ETP if you're fancy is my favourite of all the Earls. Known for their food that can go toe to toe against any other Earls in the world and servers who are a few notches above than the other locations.  This place is great for: 1) families 2) divorced fathers 3) single men 4) the lonely who are starved for attention  This place is not great for: 1) unaccompanied minors 2) religious fundamentalists 3) committed men who have a wandering eye or a past history of infidelity"}
{"text":"I went in for a late dinner on Tuesday and the overall experience was good.   ***Service*** Our server was very friendly and promptly brought us the things we requested (cocktail list, cutlery, water, etc.). She informed us of all the different promotions they were offers and she had great product knowledge on the food and beverage. She was very good with checking in on us frequently, but not so much that it felt like she was hovering.   ***Food*** Dynamite Prawn & Mango Roll - This was the best thing we tried. The shrimp was nice and crispy and it was a good portion too. The spicy mayo goes well with the sweeter sauce (I think it was maple) soy).   Sablefish (on the promo menu) - The fish was cooked beautifully. It flaked nicely, but could have used more seasoning. The snap peas were not trimmed so I had to pull quite a few of those tough threads out of my mouth while I was eating. Not the most pleasant or ladylike thing to be doing. I also found the soba noodles to be overdone.   Hunan Kung Pao with Chicken - My boyfriend ordered this and to be honest, it's overpriced and poorly executed Chinese food. It was a large portion, but some pieces of chicken were burnt so they tasted bitter. If you want stir fried noodles, just go to Chinatown.  Key Lime Pie - This is a massive piece of pie and could be enough for three people. It was super tart and definitely needed the whipped cream to help tame down how tangy it was.   Of the four items we tried, I'd only order the Dynamite Roll again.  ***Drinks*** Beez Kneez - this was a really nice cocktail. Hendrinks, Cointreau, honey and lemon. I would definitely order this drink again.  The rest of the cocktail list looked interesting too, but it we weren't out for a night of boozing.   ***Additional notes*** It was pretty busy even though it was almost 9:00pm by the time we got there. Our server said that it's always busy there and that their kitchen is open until 2:00am! Can you imaging working BOH there? Holy late nights.  The overall timing was very good for food. The only thing that took a long time to arrive was my cocktail. It took almost eight minutes for my drink to get to me so I wonder how long the wait for cocktails would be during their pique time.  The washrooms were a mess when we left. There was no toilet paper or paper towels in the stall I used and could see that the other stalls had paper towel littered all over the floor.  ***Overall*** I would return for drinks and apps. The cocktail list has lots of options and I could see it as a good place for a ladies' night. It was raining out when we visited, but it would be a great place to have some drinks on the weekend."}
{"text":"The food was good, but our server was not. He seemed a bit annoyed when we decided not to order drinks right away. We didn't end up eating our whole meal and he was going to take away our plates and throw the food out (we had to tell him we wanted it packed up). He didn't bring us a bag to carry our left overs (we had to ask at the host station) and then he just brought us our bill without asking if we wanted coffee or dessert or anything else. It wasn't very busy, so there was no e use for him rushing and sending us on our way. On the way out, we asked to speak with the manager who did apologize for the service, told us she would be speaking with the server, gave us the manager's card and a gift card to come back for another visit. That last effort got this rating up by one star. Hopefully if we go again the service will be better."}
{"text":"I previously wrote a review on the terrible food I got mid-December, and Earls reached out promptly.  They invited us to have an experience on them, and hopefully correct the wrong-doing.    Alyda & Sarah were very professional and pleasant to deal with!  The food was amazing, and far from the experience we previously had.  I will definitely be coming here - perhaps not for dinner, but definitely for a Steak or Salmon!  We also tried the sticky toffee desert that was recommended, and it was delicious.   I can't say enough good things about their prompt response with our other experience, and how they rectified it.  Thank you again for having us! =)"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. We had a waitress named Laura and she was awful. First time here, never coming again. Beer was cold, but took forever to get served. Food decent, but again, the service diminished it greatly. Get rid of Laura and manage your establishment to a higher standard. Better off going to Jack Astor's across the street."}
{"text":"OMG THIS PLACE IS SO GOOD! I can't believe it's a chain and sosososoooooOoOOoO good. Minutes away from work, we came here for a lunch. We had to make resos, and that was definitely a good idea because it was more packed than a costco in markham on a saturday afternoon.   The place is huge and very spacious. Tables are very large, so that's great. Service was spectacular - kept checking on us at regular times but not overly overbearing.  HIGHLIGHTS: - house wine was delicious and smooth - garlic fries made me want to sin. SERIOUSLY, THESE ARE THE CARBS THAT I LIKE. \"Just f- me up, fam\" I couldn't stop. And now I can't stop thinking about it. This is rough. - Veggie burger was mouthgasm-worthy. Great brioche bun, soft but has a bit of crisp, just the way I like it. Packed with veggies etc. It could barely fit in my mouth. Hah.  Oh my goodness, I was SO full, I had instant itis at the office and almost passed out at my desk. It was worth it though. Soooo worth.  The portions are HUGE!"}
{"text":"This location is better compared to vaughan location. Nice food, good hospitality and the patio is very good."}
{"text":"The service is very poor. The saving grace is amazing baby back ribs + caujan chicken. I just go there when i want to have this dish which is amazing for me. Thats why 2 star."}
{"text":"I love the place, the decoration & the upscaled setting & unofficial dress  code... I had couple of dishes there, they all were way less than average..  I would go back for a drink.. but not for dinner!!"}
{"text":"I should really write a review for here since I come here more often than I would like to admit.   So here goes:  Started with my mom always wanting their happy hour specials when we're out shopping, then one magical day when I found out they had half-priced wine on Tuesdays, plus great specials on other nights.  Their happy hour food menu has dwindled over time for sure, what they have online doesn't even match their in restaurant offers, so an update will be great.   Their food is hit or miss, some have been pretty bad (mushroom soup, steak, wilted salads, sushi rolls, veggie burger)  Some has been amazing (tuna tartar/ some of their salads, pastas, wings, fries, and ribs)  Service is good most of the time, once in a while it's another story. More than one occasion I can hear the staff gossiping near the kitchen or bar about their own lives or customers.   The beer/wine offerings are pretty good.Veggie options not so much!  So I know for the most part what to expect when I go there but nothing spectacular!"}
{"text":"We decided to celebrate our anniversary on our actual anniversary which was a Wednesday. We went to earls for dinner. Lots of gluten aware selections. I had the calamari to start and it was fabulous. It was cooked perfectly. The main was fish and chips. It was greasy as could be and over cooked. But I still enjoyed it since I never have fish and chips being celiac. I substituted the regular fries for the garlic fries. They started off good until I took a bite of what I thought was fries but was actually a dolop of chopped garlic. It blew out my tastebuds so badly the rest of the night was flavourless. My husband had the chilli chicken to start. The wontons were crispy and the chicken well cooked. The chilli sauce tasted like it came straight from the bottle of Thai chilli sauce. The main was the jeera chicken curry. It was really nice. The naan wasn't very good. It tasted more like a prepackaged pita then naan. The server was super nice. And overall it was a nice atmosphere since it was pretty empty. I could see it being very loud when it's full."}
{"text":"This is the Earls that's close to the airport off the Barlow Trail.  Gayle and I had both a lunch and a dinner here during one of our trips.  She wanted to sit out on the patio with a glass of wine and hear a foreign language.  She got her wish, but it wasn't French!  I had also told Gayle that Earl's had an \"eye candy\" reputation regarding their employees.  Afterwards, she opined that the Lunch staff must have been in training.  We both a casual dining experience with a dash of class and Earls certainly appeals to our Midwest sensibilities.  For both of our meals, the food to be tasty, the portions were reasonable, the wine pairings were spot on, and the price was right."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, friendly service, and the food was excellent. Tried their Fish Tacos and had a nibble of my friend's spicy chicken, both very fresh, nice texture, presentation, and taste.   Next time I'm in the west end, I'll make s point of stopping by and explore the menu a tad more."}
{"text":"My family went to have dinner at Earl's after shopping at Square one. We had truffle fries (perfectly made and very flavourful), calamari (great tasting but not crisp enough), crisp ribs ( a bit on the dry side but delicious). My wife had the bi bim bap ( she says it was only ok and not authentic but it is understandable as this is not a Korean place), my son and I had the fish and chips (brilliantly made, light batter with a side of coleslaw and fries, tender tasty cod) and my daughter had the Kung Pao noodle (a bit on the wet/saucy side but tasty). We had a really nice picher of raspberry marguarita on sale for $20 which was refreshing. We sat at the patio outdoors and it was a very nice setting and ambiance. The service was very excellent and friendly. I was surprized as all the waitresses look like super fashion models but they were really friendly, down to earth and non pretentious. Would recommend."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to Earls but charging extra for tonic water (because they don't want to carry it on the gun) is absolutely ridiculous.  If I order a vodka sofa I'm nit expected to pay separately for the soda, so why take up fridge space to stock tiny bottles of tonic water and not inform customers of thus when ordering?"}
{"text":"This is the best place to have an upscale night out with your friends or even mingle with others after work.  The social and mingling atmosphere is warm and bubbly.   On the outside patio, gorgeous vinery encloses it. I find it really exclusive that the entrance is tucked away within a polished wooden tunnel where a bouncer awaits to direct you. Seating is self-serve and menus are brought over.   Beehave (honey, basil, lemon, grapefruit juice & soda ) -  got this from the server's recommendation and it's soo unique. It's not too fizzy and has the right amount of sweetness. I absolutely LOVED this.   Ginger Beer (ginger syrup & soda) - diluted enough so even haters can enjoy it  Tinga Chicken Tacos w/ Truffle fries The chicken was minced and lean which was unexpected but still good.  However the chipotle and avocado flavours were nonexistent and was replaced with water.  The radishes and taco shells were the best part. The fries probably sat out for awhile as they were not as crispy as i had wanted.  They were served with their own mix of pepper and salt which was nice and gritty but made me really thirsty afterwards. The truffle aioli was mostly garlic butter with a hint of fungi, but wasn't as good as the Trump Hotel's version."}
{"text":"Ok so if you can look past the douchey exterior this place is pretty good!! Their artichoke and spinach dip is A+++++ Also love their salads. They also have a pretty good white wine peach sangria! The servers are always really friendly and the food quality is always really good."}
{"text":"The first time I went here I went with a work party and had the butter chicken curry. It was great and so was the cabin fever drink. However the second time was a completely different experience. I had wings which were tiny and burnt. I ordered the cabin fever again but this time it was much worse. Both times the service was great."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a girls night and had a blast!  Our server (I forgot her name, thanks half priced Wine Tuesdays lol) was absolutely lovely and had no issues splitting our cheques in weird ways for our party of 9 girls.  We enjoyed a few bottles of delicious half priced wine (going up on a Tuesday!) and I also ordered a sushi roll which was really yummy.  Perfect place for happy hour after work downtown!"}
{"text":"Came here for a double date! Food was great! I had the rib and chicken combo. I'm glad they have a craft beer selection. They also have there in-house beer. Washrooms are clean. It's a great atmosphere for a night out with your special someone :)"}
{"text":"Ambience: great. Love the filament light bulbs and gargantuan lounge space.  Service: with a smile, and with attitude. Can't book a table in the lounge, first come first served- yet 2 large empty tables, were reserved. When we seated ourselves and asked to be informed about a bigger space opening up, was told to stand by the bigger space and wait for it. (?!)  Food: chicken,Brie and fig ciabatta was divine, wonderfully crusty and gooey at the same time. Perfect fig spread to infuse the chicken breast. Sticky toffee pudding: a farce- massive brownie coated with molten werthers. Terrible.  Wouldn't go back as it took way too long for everything - cant blame them they are huge there- and don't like the non booking concept in the patio and the lounge."}
{"text":"My date and I were a little tight for time as our movie was starting in 1 hour. Our waitress was awesome! She understood our time crunch and worked quickly to get our meals to our table. Our meals were delicious and the quality was not compromised."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place. My friend and I came on St. Patrick's Day where there was live music and dancing, luckily we got seats at the bar to enjoy our dinner and green drinks! I had the Dynamite Roll, as well as a small Caesar salad, and my friend had the soup and salad combo (also with the Caesar salad). The food was unbelievable, and the environment was even better! Not only was the staff behind the bar an absolute blast (I'm looking at you Pavel and Brooke) BUT we also sat next to off-time employees Polly and Indigo, who not only recommended our sushi, but continued to check in with us after we had taken a few bites!! Service off the clock!! We will DEFINITELY be coming back, thank you Earls!"}
{"text":"Use to be a great place to eat!! Now, hmmmm \"awful\" would be the word that comes to mind. Let's go over the last 4 times there- cheddar bacon burger- had it the first time and it was dry and over cooked, I hoped it was only once, and tried the same item about a week later, same/same, dry and over cooked. Gave Earls another chance a week or so later; ordered 2 orders of Santa Fe salad with chicken. Both came out with chicken that was burnt, when the server was told, they made 2 new ones, and only charged for one. Fourth and last time, I went to Earls because a friend of mine likes it there, I mentioned it was going down hill, and my friend was surprised. But only surprised until he got his chicken sandwich, which he found to be dry and over cooked, which seems to be the \"norm\" for this place now.  Not sure what has happened to this location, but guessing bad management!"}
{"text":"The new tipping format is fantastic.  16% flat tip and then the staff is tripping over themselves to give you good service.  Great model, congrats to Earl's for implementing it.  Food is top quality that we've all come to expect from Earl's.  I only wish they would take reservations.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night at prime dinner time. We were told to wait for 45min but got a table sooner than that. Ordered a Bellini as it was the special that night for $6, it tasted like a sweet fruity slush and couldn't taste any alcohol. I also got the Chicken Cheddar Sandwich with garlic fries. I think the sandwich was A-Ok and wanted to just give 3 stars for this review, but when thinking about the garlic fries I gave a 4-star. The garlic fries were skinny crispy fries with a side of garlic mayo if I had to guess. They were addicting."}
{"text":"Sat and waited for over an hour for main courses. Drinks were left unfilled and dirty plates left in front of us.  After telling our waitress, another women and a manager that we had not received our food it finally arrived. People had come and gone in the time we waited for our mains. The took a sprite and a beer off the bill. I will never come back to this earls and I can't believe I paid for this service."}
{"text":"Food is too salty. Had ordered happy hour appetizers, such a disappointment, not impressed and able to get better appetizers almost anywhere. Ordered fries, they tasted like they were old, reheated in the oil one too many times. Ordered riblets, terrible over cooked and way too salty. The pizza was ok. I don't recommend."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of earls around Calgary....even worked in a few of them lol.  But have never experienced the level of service and product knowledge Michaela T. Offers at this establishment.  She makes going out exciting again.  If you ever make it out to this location make sure you ask for Michaela.  One of the best!  Thanks again will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I found Earls was quite a happening place on a cold winters Tuesday night. The atmosphere was good and so was the service. I was surprised to find out it was a franchise."}
{"text":"The teenager hosts are very seductive   Not where I want too bring people for a business lunch   Good food though"}
{"text":"Had Nicole in the lounge tonight, she was amazing. Food was phenomenal and the service was great as well. The new southwest burger is a nice addition!! Great work Dalhousie!!"}
{"text":"6 out of ten at the very best. Certainly a disappointment. Met a friend early in the evening for wine and dinner. I don't go out a lot, so ate very little (saving my appetite!) anticipating a great meal. We ordered a bottle of wine (which does not come in a bottle by the way, because it's the house wine? Really, did they tap a keg? Not informed in advance. Not cool.) and I ordered a 7 oz steak ($25) with mushrooms (extra$5) and garlic toast (extra$5). I ordered my steak medium.  My steak was charred (seriously charred black) and well done (ugh) around the edges, barely pink in the middle. Mushrooms were hot. Garlic toast good. It comes with (apparently) cold mashed potatoes and some melange of beets with squash (I think) and apples slices ( really, that's a vegetable now?) served over some intolerable white creamy substance that was completely unappetizing, not detailed and certainly not desired. I was so hungry and do not want to inconvenience my friend, so I ate it, but the steak was dry and unenjoyable. I mentioned all of this to the waitress and was very polite about it, but I was obviously disappointed. So you'd think she'd maybe have offered a dessert or something, but nope. No effort to try and make amends. All I can say is, I'll not be dining there again. Ever. And I urge you to find somewhere else if you want a nice meal. There are plenty of good places to eat in Calgary. This isn't one of them."}
{"text":"Quality is not on the menu. I stopped in for dinner on my way in from the airport. The place was busy, most likely people heading to the movie theatre.   For a appetizer, we had the Dynamite Roll. It reminded me of Bento Sushi in the cooler at the grocery store- the rice had an old texture as if it had been in the fridge for hours.   The Kung Pao Noodles was most of all a sodium bomb, tasting like packaged noodles, bottled salty sauce and rough vegetables. I didn't finish it.   For a reference, I tasted a bit of Fettucini Alfredo another member of my party had ordered. It was the opposite, relatively flavourless.   There are a lot of competitors in the area that would be a better choice."}
{"text":"Not like it was a few years back. I got the Cajun chicken tacos and the chicken was so dry that it made the tacos taste horrible I couldn't taste anything else in it. Our server Larysa? nice but horrible at the same time. She would ask what we want and would be in a rush to leave. She came around a couple of times and asked what we wanted and me and my boyfriend were talking about which one to get and she literally just walked away to another table while we were talking to each other trying to come to a decision without asking if we needed more time. When it was time to get the bill she gave us the bill and didn't even look at us and didn't even ask if I needed a debit machine or not she just walked away. She really just became a b**** at the end of it. This place used to have better food better things on the menu and better service."}
{"text":"Bar is much better than the restaurant part. Because the place is very loud. So if you are there for drink and finger food it is ok but for eating i think it was a little too loud. Food is good but pricy."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is great and the service is pretty good too. They have redesigned this building and it looks great, especially the patio. With that being said; the food is below average. I've gone here a few times thinking it might be my bad luck but they have never cooked my stake correct. Rare steaks served as mediums. My girlfriends fish taco was also literally wet it was so soggy."}
{"text":"Great! Really great! I loved their lunch special of a Warm Kale Salad. It was substantial enough as a meal.  Service was also terrific. The waitress refilled our drinks very quickly."}
{"text":"Met some friends here after work and it was way too noisy to have a decent conversation.  The hamburgers were good though."}
{"text":"sat outside in the patio, very hip atmosphere. All the little plates we ordered were fantastic, chicken wontons with a sweet chili sauce one of my favorites, Hunan Kung Pao---so tasty!!!! We tried 3 white wines, the 2 Viogniers but liked the 3rd try un-oaked Chardonnay the best. Friendly waitress checking in often. Would like to go back and order a full dinner sometime. Great Spot!"}
{"text":"Sorry for the delay in writing. This occurred on Sunday, August 3rd.  I went to Earl's after the Kevin Hart comedy show and I was looking forward to having some yummy grub and a glass or two of wine but I was highly disappointed in the service. Every time I go there I have a good experience but this time pretty much turned me off from going.  My friend and I ordered a bottle of white wine, the girl who delivered the wine, brought it out and left it on the table. It was a chilled bottle but she never opened it and poured it for us. Although that's poor service, I didn't really care too much about that---what I cared about was that she didn't bring a chiller for our wine. She said \"I'll get the chiller\" and didn't come back. It was only until 20 minutes later we had to ask for it and she was like \"oh! Ok yea, I forgot!\".  Then, another waiter, a young man came over and was taking our food orders. We had two tables of 4 right beside each other. We all were considered one party. We walked in and asked for seating of 6 so they sat us there. No problem. My issue is that the other table got their food 10 minutes before mine did. The other table patiently waited until I had to say \"go ahead and eat because clearly we aren't getting our food at the same time\". I had ordered Tinga Tacos (chicken) which the waiter stressed was SOOO good. Finally when my meal arrives,  I take two bites and think \"I don't taste chicken\" and I open it up and there it's Fish Tacos instead of Chicken. So I tell the waitress and she says she punched in the right order so she's not sure why they gave me the wrong one. She gave a light apology and now my tacos arrive well after everybody has already eaten. And, to top it off, the chicken ones didn't even taste good!!! I was offered no compensation for the food mix-up and late orders either. Not even a discount. My sister is extremely allergic to fish so if she had one bite of it, she would have had allergy flare up and could have possibly died.  After this experience---I am weary to recommend anyone with any allergy to eat at a place that treats these things so leisurely."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the ambiance, the servers were great and it is a cool place to grab some beers and bar grub.  But I didn't think the food was that great.   The pizza was the best part of our meal, along with, surprisingly enough, the curry chicken plate.  They were both decent.  But the other things we ordered for the table, roasted corn dip, calamari, burgers were bar food quality."}
{"text":"Service was great! Food was good. Menu was slim but at least there is a variety of different types of food and they do it well. Super friendly service, trendy but a great atmosphere and equally nice patio. Never had to ask for a top up of water or ask for additional things."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on Saturday night; been a few times but this time it was an ultimate fail ... from the waiter who said he was new and kept coming back because he got things wrong ... to the food that was cold and gave my husband horrible diarrhea ... would not go back after this experience ... horrible service, unknowledgeable staff and horrible food!"}
{"text":"I came on a Tuesday evening for happy hour I ordered the personal size margarita pizza for $3.50 and the coconut Hawaiian shrimp for $9 they do have good deals for happy hour  The Margarita Pizza had great flavor I just wish that there was more sauce on the pizza the shrimp had a little bit too much coconut for my liking and it also came with a side of coleslaw however my coleslaw was brown so I did not touch it and I cannot give my opinion on how it tasted  I was in a group of six they forgot one item that we ordered and gave us an extra item that we didn't order the server was really friendly so overall I don't think I would go back I wasn't upset or highly disappointed but I wasn't really that happy either"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour. They have specials everyday.  Went on a Friday.  2 Oz Mojitos are $8. Ordered some apps.. great for catching up with friends after work."}
{"text":"This is a picture of the two hostess's cutting the tags out of each others underwear! Gross!!"}
{"text":"I've been here before but thought I would give it another shot. Glad I did.   It's supposed to be pub food but they have these features that goes on for a few months and change. We had 2 items from the feature menu and they were both so good!  Warn kale salad: they made kale taste good!  Please keep this on the menu!  Bipbambab - the Korean stone bowl rice. Great flavours and very authentic.   The manager was super helpful. Came out and told us they was a small delays in the kitchen and they are re making our dishes. Very attentive."}
{"text":"Very good place!  I've tested the brunch and a afterwork/diner, food is good and there's a good choice on the menu.   Busy place in financial district but it's pretty big so you don't feel packed!  It's quiet during the weekend but the atmosphere is nice on weekdays afterwork.   Price are the ones expected, no surprise. Service is good as well!  Business casual."}
{"text":"First off- I am an Earls Girl Alumni - I worked for Earls for years and drink the kool aid 1000%. I bring out clients daily for drinks and lunches and have always been confident that the entire experience will be fabulous. To date that hasn't changed. I have to comment however on the new way the calamari is being served. I was absolutely stunned when it was served to me yesterday. Fir starters, it would appear they took a spoon and smeared the white dip on the plate, it sure as heck isn't tzatziki sauce. (I still remember the old school recipe). It's garnished with basil, olives, tomatoes and who knows what else. The breading isn't the same either and it was greasy. I sent it back and the server was cool about it. Earls please go back to the way you used to serve the calamari. It's tried tested and true. It's delicious the old way."}
{"text":"1.5*  This review is mainly based on the food. Service was great for the most part other than when we needed to get the bill.  I had pretty high expectations with the food as in the past when I visited during lunch, it was pretty good. I haven't been to Earls in awhile and when I found out brunch was available, I decided to take my parents. The avocado toast looked great on Yelp but I decided to get the Eggs Benny. My dad got the country breakfast which was the typical breakfast platter and our server's recommendation. My mom got the sausage and eggs. Generally I would say everything would have looked and tasted better if it was not over cooked and so dark looking (partly burnt). I felt like the grill or pan that they prepared everything on was not clean. My husband got a fried chicken sandwich and even that looked a shade darker than typically expected.   The restaurant establishment's design, ambience and location do deserve the extra half star- being inside square one and due to the convenience is great. However, I was quite disappointed with the food and because of this I would definitely go to another restaurant in the surrounding area."}
{"text":"VERY TASTY food! Get ready to get those taste buds blasted!! The food was delicious. The atmosphere amazing. Inside and outside had such a cool vibe. Service was great! Polite staff. Can't wait to go back! :) we were there to celebrate for my brothers birthday and got the toffee cake. Shared it between the 4 of us and it was just right! A friend recommended it to me and I shall recommend it to you!"}
{"text":"One thing for sure, the restaurant is a nice and classy looking place on the interior but the dishes are a hit or miss. It was my first time trying them out so am not thoroughly familiar with their other dishes and drinks.. but for starters, we got the Italian style pan bread and I personally thought they could put a little more effort on this because you can buy a bread in some random bakery somewhere and this would look CHEAP. Seriously.   Anyway, I got the mediterranean linguini with chicken and am so sad to say it wasnt my thing.. it was alright but it I didnt eat it with gusto. My hubby, however, got the Royale with Cheese burger and he said it was a little too salty for his liking...and I confirmed he wont get it again.   Honestly am not hating on this restaurant because I haven't tried their other dishes to give it a solid thumbs down. Am giving them three stars because the utensils on our table was dirty.. and the table wasn't properly cleaned because I saw little bit of crumbs as well. Mind you they weren't busy when we came in so they had time to clean and check.. just my opinion.   If it wasn't for our hostess and server, I would give it a two star rating. Great customer service so keeping that in mind I might try them out in the future again... just not too soon...just to see if I would change my mind if theres a dish am missing out from.  Note:  I did take in to account of the reviews and what people personally told me about this resto which all pointed to \"no\". But I went on anyway because why the heck not."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  Great atmosphere. Can be cozy for a date, or trendy for a large dining party. I had the Cajun  Chicken. It was delicious; came with a side of very tasty warm potatoe salad. The chicken was spiced perfectly and was very juicy.  My boyfriend had the smoked salmon; he was happy with his meal as well. The portion size is really big; we were unfortunately too full to try what looked like amazing dessert selections. The only complaint I had was that we were seated quite close to the front lobby so every time the door opened we were hit with a blast of cold air (we visited on a particularly cold evening) some of the patrons actually had their coats and jackets on while eating. Had it not been for that issue I would have hands down rated 5 stars."}
{"text":"Based on my one time experience here, it was four stars. Service was super polite, friendly and prompt. Atmosphere was a great choice between the bar (music, tv, casual, lively, noisy and upbeat) and dining area (quiet and had relatively private booths/tables). The food was very good as well. Good variety on the menu and my caesar salad/margarita pizza choices didn't disappoint.  Salad was a generous size for the app portion and the dressing was spot on. The thin crust pizza would have been enough for two with another share item but it satisfied a very hungry single this evening. As a bonus they had a $4 wine special on this evening (6oz and decent quality). I would definitely come back here the next time I'm in Calgary."}
{"text":"My buddy and I had a great time at Earl's on Monday... right after the driving range and go karting!  On this occasion, I was reminded that the dining experience can be uplifted by the personality of the server... she was chatty, fun and playful... she even played along by choosing a random beer for my buddy and had him guess which one she had selected.   It was Margarita Monday and so I tried their Grapefuit Margarita, on the rocks, featuring their house-made grapefruit syrup.   WOW! It was the best margarita I've ever had... it reminded me of a time when we used sugar/grapefruit instead of salt/lemon to accompany tequila shots.  I almost ordered a second round of the Grapefuit Margarita but I tried another margarita instead... which comparatively, is not worth mentioning.  After that, I tried to convince my buddy to have another round, each ordering a Grapefuit Margarita instead of a beer.  I couldn't convince him... but hopefully I've convinced you to try it!   I enjoyed the Spicy Seafood Linguine.  It was served with a large prawn and a few small scallops and its flavour was mild.  A side of parmesan helped.  Tip:  The sushi appetizer is excellent but won't be server with soy or wasabi... ask ahead."}
{"text":"I've been to Earl's before(downtown) before and the food and service was pretty good but pricey at times. However its a nice change to visit a more suburban location to see how things pan out.  Saturday night not only is this venue usual busy, but at times finding parking can be quite the task, due to its proximity to Colossus Theatre, and other restaurants in the vicinity. Luckily, and coincidently with us arriving around 9:45, most of the dinner crowd was starting to leave as it made space for US nocturnal folks who were here to have a few drinks and converse the night away.   After finding two seats at the bar, we both decided to tackle their drink menus to see what was available. She ordered the Argentine Reserve and I ordered their Argentine Malbec (9 oz). To be honest, I found their 9oz of reds were averaged at $15-$19 which I found quite steeeeeeeep!!! so that was a bit of a bummer.  However...however the ambiance of this place is definitely nice, and both the bar and dining area are well separated from one another so you wont get bombarded by all the noise occurring in the Bar area. The service was pleasant. Unfortunately we did not have the opportunity to try some of their foods, hopefully next time......."}
{"text":"If you watch the tv show 'Suits' almost every 5th person isn't wearing a suit at this place! Lol however since your in the middle of TO financial district it's no surprise.  The ambience and lighting and friendly staff gives this place 4 stars in my books.  I decided to have the chicken mediterranean pasta, and the portion and price was quite reasonable.  However since you're in the heart of TOronto, this place can be quite pricey, depending on what you order.  The staff are friendly, and efficient, and the food is yummy.  Great place to bring a date!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Earl's when I was in Vancouver (ate at the Robson Street location). The service was good (and yes, the waitresses are really pretty) and the food was tasty and satisfying.   When Earl's opened their first location in Ontario, I wanted to see if they could live up to their Vancouver siblings. I ordered the same thing I had in Vancouver (Jeera Chicken Curry). It tasted slightly burnt - both the curry and the \"naan\". They screwed up my mother's order and it took 3 different servers and 2 managers to figure it out. (She wanted shrimp but the server forgot the shrimp and she ended up giving us a small plate of tiny cocktail shrimp to add to the thai green curry dish.)   The servers were slow and were ignorant of the menu/ingredients/how to do their jobs. I'm chalking that up to new restaurant jitters. Hopefully they'll figure that out as the months go by. And true to form, they were of the more attractive persuasion with the cleavage tops and short skirts.   I'm going to pass on Earl's until they work out their numerous kinks."}
{"text":"I went to Earls recently for a work function - it was one of the only places in the area that would take a reservation for 10+ people. When we arrived, we were seated right away and the table was great.  The service we received was also very good. My only complaint would be that the food is just OK - nothing really special about it. It's not amazing, but also not bad. Just OK.  This wouldn't be my first pick of dinner or lunch restaurants to go to in the downtown core, but for a large group, it's a very safe pick."}
{"text":"I've been to different earls locations in Vancouver many times and I'm always content with the service and the food, but I am not happy about the food and service we received at this location. Keep in mind it wasn't busy at all, so there was no excuse for the bad service.  I ordered my steak medium rare and I actually love my meat bloody, but they served a raw rib eye. The server barely checked up on us to see if we are doing okay with our meals, so I pretty much had to eat it since I was hungry.   My girlfriends dad order the salmon and he said no garlic on anything, so the waiter decided to bring a piece of salmon in the middle of a naked plate without any side dishes instead of asking what he would like to have in place of the mashed potatoes and the asparagus. We had to talk to 3 different people before we got our waiter at the table to get a salad instead the side dishes. We went through the same process for a side of lemon and he ended up with cold unseasoned fish.   We complained and the manager didn't really do anything, so there you have it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is attached to the mall. Outside appearances and the menu looked fabulous.  Hostesses sat us at an outdoor table, and were even accommodating about not seating us in the sun.  We were then greeted by a server who brought us silverware. My dad asked what the soup of the day was and he hemmed and hawed for a moment then said he didn't know, because he was in training, but he would check and be right back. We never saw him again.  Another server came by and took our drink order. We ordered water and ordered a white wine. We asked again about the soup of the day (mentioned on two different menus) but she let us know about the two soups that were already listed on the menu (tortilla and clam chowder). So no soup of the day then? Guess not. Ten minutes later she came back and told me they were out of that wine. I then asked for the ros√® which she said they were also out of. That's unacceptable to me when you only have 5-7 white wines by the glass. I will say the wine menu was quite impressive, but not when you're out of them?!? I cancelled all wine orders at that point, as it was getting annoying. Food came out. It was decent. The tortilla soup was good, but not a typical tortilla soup. Clam chowder was not \"New England style\" as stated on the menu. It was ok though.  We were in a hurry to get back to shopping, bill came, my dad paid, we left. Later that day my dad checked the receipt (yes, I realize we should have examined it earlier) and we had been charged for wine. Wine that I never received bc they were out.  My dad called and explained our dining experience and we were reimbursed $20.  So thanks for making an attempt to make our experience better."}

{"text":"Meh, this place to me is just another stuffy, run of the mill, chain restaurant whose scantly dressed waitresses cater to the downtown suits.   The venue itself is difficult to get to if you're driving. I pretty much just wouldn't recommend it all together. If you're on foot downtown, it's great. Location along the very trendy Stephen Ave right by Bankers Hall. There's just money oozing out of the buildings around this place.    The atmosphere is perfect for a business lunch or after work drinks. Very classy, clean, well presented, until the waitresses boobs hit you in the face. But otherwise good!  The menu is probably the best thing about this place. I've never had a bad dish, in fact, quite often I crave the Hunan_Kung_Pow. It's so good!  I haven't tried it all, but what I have had, has been good!  Worth a shot, if you don't mind the pretentious suits and low cut shirts all around you!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant last night for some New Years eve celebrations. The restaurant itself is very visually appeasing, the decor and bathrooms were very nice. Price range is a bit higher than we expected. Unfortunately we did have a few things that happened that would have made it a better visit otherwise. It was very cold last night and every time the front door opened we got a gust of cold air hit us, making an uncomfortable dinner. The bad part was, we weren't even near the door... Our waitress was a bit distracted as she wasn't very quick to come back to us, clear plates, take our order, bring the bill etc. Maybe she was working a lot of sections it being new years I don't know, but sitting with our finished plates in front of us for 20 minutes is a bit too long IMO. In any case she was friendly enough.  The food however was amazing! I had the chicken mushroom fettuccine. It was delicious! The portion was way too big for myself, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. We also shared a spinach dip which was tasty and creamy.  My husband on the other hand wasn't a fan of the steak. He ordered a 7 oz steak, which realistically was less than the size of a hockey puck. While it was tasty, he wasn't fond of being served beets as his main vegetable.  Overall we had a great visit, if you like girly drinks, be sure to try the Frozen White Peach Bellini!! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Two words: clam chowder!  I love me a good clam chowdah!  The best I ever had was at a place at Fisherman's Wharf...all the frakkin' way in San Francisco in sunny California!  Earls comes close with their own twist on the clam chowdah with generous amounts of bacon and clams in the milky broth that is the chowder.  Their burgers are also very juicy, staff is pretty attentive and friendly.  It's definitely up a notch from Moxies.  I always get the clam chowder when I go here along with whatever I may order at the time.  They also make a mean sangria to be enjoyed on their outdoor patio in the summer!"}
{"text":"Nice place to chill.drinks are great too"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the ambiance of this location. I ordered the Hunan Kung pao and it was very good. My husband ordered the jeera chicken curry. The food was 4* but the service was 2*.  I agree with other reviewers that the staff is more interested in preening than service."}
{"text":"Went to the Dalhousie Station Earls with my man and the food is good and service is always friendly at this location. We come here often, with friends or family or by ourselves and most often the speed of service and friendliness is usually consistent.   I ordered the Prawn and Scallop Linguini which was very flavourful; shrimp (not really prawn) and tiny scallops were cooked to perfection (not overdone). But I guess I was kind of disappointed that there was only two little scallops and three shrimp on my plate of linguini. Should I not expect a little bit more seafood for the price of this entree at 19.75?! if you want it to come with Garlic Bread it's 2.00 extra. Maybe it should come automatically with the side of bread if you're gonna skimp on the seafood. I'm just saying. I'm a petite skinny woman and I didn't think I was being fed enough food lol!   Other than that, the ambiance, dim lighting and music make this location a pleasant restaurant to dine at. The only reason I'm giving four stars instead of five is because I think they were being a little stingy on the seafood."}
{"text":"It's \"ok\". We went late on a Thursday night. At about 9pm the music was cranked and and it became more like a club. That was a pain as the music was so loud you couldn't talk. That being said, it seems to be the vibe post 8pm as the place got crazy popular.   The food was decent. I had the ribs - very good and fall off the bone. The warm potato salad was super yummy too. Cole slaw was decent.   Good place for food (before 9pm)."}
{"text":"This is one of those stupid typical trendy bars. They do have a nice outdoor patio area, you just have to get past all the snobby looks.   We ordered a round of drinks because the waitress took too long. She finally came around ordered another round. The ambiance sucked so we decided to leave; I spotted the waitress & asked her for the check and that also took too long.   I tried to track her down and she was back at the same table that I found her at before closing the check there first. At this point I was really upset and walked over & gave her money and told her that if it wasn't enough that she'll have to eat the difference for making me wait & left. I left her more than enough and she apparently tried to chase us down & caught up with someone else in our group saying we left without paying. So no only is she a terrible waitress, she's a liar too."}
{"text":"Waiting for a table was more enjoyable than the actual dinner. The hostesses were very nice, and the restaurant offered drinks and food samples while we waited. But our sever was so slow, never asked how we were doing, and was so hard to get a hold of. Overall the food was subpar, not worth the price.   Enjoyed the crispy thai prawns. The chicken and wonton is exactly what you'd expect. Hot wings were good but small.   Ordered and didn't like: Los Cabos chicken tacos (you only get 2 for $15) Crispy tuna sushi cone (the restaurant does not have soy sauce, so it's weird they serve sushi) BBQ pork buns (you get 3. Really dry, could use a sauce) Margherita pizza (they forgot to put on the basil!!)   We also ordered the mixed greens, but the service was so bad it never came!"}
{"text":"Been here two times basically because everything else was closed after the late night movies.  Both times the servers were late in taking our order and just providing overall attentive service.  However,  you have to take into consideration that we sat a little further away from the bar (the hot spot)  and it was after 11pm. Maybe daytime service is a little bit \"chipper\".    I've been to earls in Alberta too and I just find the food and cocktail underwhelming.  Earls is just your average run-of-the-mill mediocre franchises where you can expect a decent 3 star experience.  So that's what I'll give it -  3 stars.    But heads up,  this location in particular is super loud with some obnoxious staff.  The type to stand on the bar and make out with their colleagues (cool if that's your thing,  but can I get my drink I ordered 15 minutes ago?) .  Jussayin!   Nowadays I just pretty much try to avoid earls.  It's like putting a damper on a good night..."}
{"text":"Another Earls? Well at least this one looks nice(r).  Well normally I'm quite a big fan of Earls locations as they offer pretty good quality of food at reasonable prices. Unfortunately when I visited this location, I was met with a poor quality steak that let me down. Everyone else at the table seemed to enjoy their meal, so I am partially jotting it down to a bad cut of meat. Oh and servers, if you're reading this, you need to talk louder!  Slightly above average food for slightly above average prices."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a colleague.  Firstly, the servers were overly ambitious to take our order (which is great) but finally when we were actually ready to order...  they were nowhere to be found.    The glasses were dirty and mine still had a lipstick stain on it.  The waiter barely reacted when I pointed out the fact.  I ordered the garlic bread with cheese and it wasn't great....  it was very salty.  For lunch, I had the appetizer size of the gnocci, as it was recommend by the server.  It was tasty but arrived luke warm, almost cold.  Again this was shunned off by the waiter.  I have visited Earls in the west coast in the past and was always satisfied...  this was very disappointing to me.  Service wasn't great, food was worse. In the future I will visit Moxie's or Milestones."}
{"text":"I've just ever had late night drinks here so can't comment on the food, but if you are looking for a lively and fun spot definitely come here.  Luckily we got a big table without reservations but it definitely gets packed (after work crowd).   There is a huge outdoor patio.  This restaurant can seat quite a few people so when it's packed it can get quite loud.   For being busy the service was good.  The drinks are interesting and are on par with this area.    If you want to be seen then definitely come here :)"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has horrible reviews. It can get crowded and noisy at times but it's a big restaurant and it's downtown. What do you expect? I think the food is pretty dang tasty and they have a decent beer selection. The service I've had here as always been very good and attentive and I've never had to wait long for my meal. They do try to do the whole upscale pub type of food and I think they do a pretty good job for a chain restaurant. The waitresses are gorgeous too."}
{"text":"The best part of this is the outdoor patio. The worst part is, the snoby waitresses and clientele.  Being in the financial district, I should have expected it.  (This is just not my point of view, I saw the waitresses laughing at a client for something they did.  Like a mean laugh, like the ones bullies do at school.)  The patio however is pretty kick ass.. The patio feels like you are inside a house with comfy couches and heated lamps, but the roof is non existent. You are surrounded by beautifully lit sky scrapers and a view of the CN tower if you are sitting in the right location.  They have drink specials every day of the week. That night it was 2oz for some special cocktail (I forget what exactly, but it was some girly drink. Hot Tip: They have brown food coloring to make it look like scotch.)  for $10 including tip."}
{"text":"Was my 3rd time at Earls kitchen here at square one , and I had a chance to try a few different things on the menu , so it was time for a review .... I thoroughly enjoyed everything I've tested in all honesty . From the dynamo rolls sushi to the yam fries which are fantastic to the penutbutter cookie which is amazing !!  Service was pretty good on all of my visits waitress was pleasant and ontop of everything .  Place is clean and modern and venue has good options . The place is great for lunch or dinner aswell as cocktails or a drink with a date or your buddy !"}
{"text":"Im pretty sure Earls will always be one of my favorites. I love the fact that they will prepare you anything u want from old menus if they have ingredients. The staff are all super nice and easy to look at :) Awesome pizza too. I also like Earls cause they have always been consistent in the service and food they put on the table. Good job guys."}
{"text":"B - List overall. A - List - Only if you get a comfy seat outside with glorious Alberta blue skies overhead. This is likely the best Earls in the city for ambiance and style. The food is still good to very good, portions vary and is generally over priced. The help is very young and very inexperienced. They will smile for you. However, make no mistake, many of the staff appear to be largely disinterested. A light dinner or lunch with drinks will set you back $50 to $60. There is better in almost every quadrant of the city. This would not be my first choice for a special night out. However, if you are driving by, this may fill the void. Style over substance here. But the style can be irresistible at times. You decide."}
{"text":"B - List. Earl's is a fun place particularly on the summer patio. Earl's management appears to have adopted an Interesting selection process when hiring employees. The staff could be considered young as well as the front-line duty managers. The food is good and relatively expensive given ingredients, portion and preparation of food. The decor is Interesting. I am not sure what words would adequately describe the interior. For distractions from your date, there are plenty of plasma screens in view with mostly irritating music videos blarring and/or sporting events. Did I say this place can be really noisy? Keep yelling at your dinner date!   Service? Hit and miss. Some days are good; the right person who knows what they are doing and demonstrates a minimum standard of care and knowledge will surprise you. On other occasions, the service is, quite frankly, high-schoolish with the manager pretending to apologize for the staff's lack of training, work and life experience. Additionally, observation, listening, and thinking skills are, at times, in short supply . It is obvious to many that these foibles are not one time events.   Still people line-up to get in, human behavior what it is. There is, in general, better food and more pleasant dining experiences elsewhere. But that is not why people come to Earl's. I suspect many come due to the 'scene' the Earl's originators have created for the public, a manufactured 'hip and happening' place where you can let your mind wander as you survey the landscape within or feel 'in the zone' as the conversation noise levels cascade throughout the evening. You suddenly feel as if you are some place important, as you are."}
{"text":"This place, although mildly over rater is an alright place to go.  Was here on a Tuesday afternoon, around 4pm and the patio was full (I don't know how).  We got a seat in the bar area, and it filled up quickly.  The food:  ordered nachos (delish, they had some ahi tuna on it, the name escapes me now), and i ordered a sushi roll, (I think it's the only one on the menu).  Both delish.    Seems somehow more posh than when I visited locations in Edmonton/Calgary and Vancouver years ago.  But it's been a while, so it's hard to tell."}
{"text":"Was my first time in Toronto and came here for a late dinner. I sat at the bar and the bartender was really cool. I gotten one of the best chicken fettuccine Alfredo's I ever had! It was amazing! Along with the mojito I had ordered. I enjoyed the service so much I came the next day and gotten dessert which was also delicious. This is one of the restaurants I'll always stop by to whenever I'm in Toronto =]"}
{"text":"Pretty damn good. I had the sirloin. He had chicken. Eat here. Neat atmosphere. Sports on as well. I love this place.   Our server was AMAZING."}
{"text":"Good restaurant. I only wish they had the regular menu as other earl's like the tuna poke!"}
{"text":"Stopped here after a 5 hour flight into Calgary. We were coming through town and hitting Yelp up for suggestions. We came across this place and decided to give it a go despite the 3 1/2 stars.   I have to say I'm glad we did. We both had the Hunan Kung Pao and it delivered all we were hoping for. We opted for the vegetarian version and found it ample and filling. Just watch out for the chili peppers hidden in the noodles.   We were there in the middle of the week a little after lunchtime, and found the restaurant filled with people.   Prices were reasonable, but they don't really cater to children. So might want to go elsewhere if you have young ones.   Long story longer, happy with my first meal in Canada in more than 10 years."}
{"text":"I've never been a big fan of Chain restaurants, especially not for dinner - love the small scale ones that seat about 35  - 50. Earls is one of those places I would go to for drinks, and good conversation... not so much for a solid dinner. We had a group of 10 and were seated at these LARGE square tables... it was actually a little difficult to talk because the person across from me seemed so far away. The ambiance is definitely swanky - love the chandeliers, comfy chairs and the large space... the patio I've yet to try. The waitress through we were waiting for more people so disappeared for about 20 minutes while we were waiting for her to come back to take our order.  I ended up getting the Los Cabos Chicken Tacos and came with cajun sauce on the side. It came with two for $11, but if you wanted a full meal (ie - fries), then you can add $2.50 for them. The taco looked very appetizing - full of colours, lots of toppings, but at the end of the day.. I didn't really taste a lot of chicken... in fact I was more wondering where it was. My friends who opted for the lobster and shrimp salad were definitely not satisfied as it looked bare, and I think there was a tablespoon of lobster meat... makes me wonder if it actually came from a can. The large shrimp definitely didn't love up to its size and it just looked minimalistic. Other people's meals seemed okay so I would advise to stay from the specials. The place is definitely hopping every day of the week. Make reservations if you can, especially for large groups. Enjoy the people you are with because you may not enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Been enjoying the Happy Hour menu and service.   Good service, and all the dishes tried so far have been enjoyable. Chicken and ribs are a favorite."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, Earls is so much better compared to the rest. The food is actually decent. Earls is one of my To-go places for happy hour drinks. The patio is huge here and I love the atmosphere.   It is in the heart of financial district. Usually quite busy on weeknights especially Thursday and Friday. The patio is first come first serve basis and it's usually crowded by 6pm on summer weeknights. But there's usually many empty tables inside. The patio is just crowded because Toronto people highly value patio weather and everyone just wants to be outside  Their happy hour specials are 3-5pm. But if you miss it, there are daily specials as well.  I love the pink lemonade cocktail. Very refreshing for the summer !  Service is always friendly and efficient. Servers ACTUALLY check up on your water frequently. Unlike other chain restaurants ...  I love earls. The service is great. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks are exactly what can be expected from a casual chain restaurant. The prices are also nothing out of the ordinary from a downtown Toronto financial district restobar. The only thing that detracts from the place is the service. The waiting staff feel cold and disinterested most of the times I've been there. I guess they know they'll have a stream of patrons regardless by virtue of their location. The patio is beautiful during the day and gets intimate at night. Just watch out for metal umbrella stands on the patio at night as they are hard to see and they don't move them out of the way. My friend tripped over one and cut herself one evening."}
{"text":"I used to love this restaurant but it's made changes over the last few years.  They change the menus more than once a year I'm sure and they are giving less meat and taking away a lot of the sides. The pasta dishes don't have much meat or seafood in them at all anymore. The only pastas they offer have no meat at all unless you pay extra for it. If I want chicken pasta I am not  going to order alfredo pasta and pay extra to put chicken on top of it. Just make a pasta that has chicken like you used to. I find they have a lot of fusion dishes too which are Asian- American, etc. Some people have trouble with really spicy food even if it's not exactly hot,  and children can't eat them at all.  They also charge extra for sides that should come with the meal for the prices they are charging.The mini burger appetizer frequently comes burned. I think when they melt the cheese they overcook the meat and it burns. The waitress agreed it's a problem more often than it should be. Other than that the service is good, they are friendly and the food is average. But they are open late which is a plus if you are hungry late as nothing else is open in the area at that time!"}
{"text":"When did Earl's stop serving pizza?!?! So disappointing! Still, good food and great staff."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a couple of coworkers and absolutely loved my experience! Excellent food and customer service! There was a slight wait for a table and so they entertained us with complimentary apps and prosecco. Free prosecco?! I'm a fan! When we were seated not 10 minutes later I ordered the chicken tacos with a side salad and both were so delicious and fresh tasting. Slightly different flavour pallets but they somehow worked together. Everyone was super pleased with their meals and with the service. It certainly did not feel like we were eating lunch in a mall. Definitely recommend and will have to check out the location downtown."}
{"text":"The service at this location was fairly pretentious. The reason I give three stars is because the food was decent. The only time our server smiled or seemed to care was when she brought the machine over to pay, obviously it was tip time. As a former bartender myself, I'm a great tipper when there's an effort made. She really didn't want to be there and was more interested in chatting with her fellow servers in the corner than offering up another drink when we sat there with zero offers for 15 minutes on another bevy. Completely unacceptable in today's service industry. We went elsewhere for another couple of rounds that this company I'm sure would have appreciated? Overall, I will not be back to this location in the future."}
{"text":"I was here a few months ago and the food was really good.  I visited today and the food was ok.  The chicken tacos were good.  The steak and calamari were ok.  Today we were served by two waitresses.  The first one was very friendly, the second didn't seam too genuine.  I guess the inconsistency isn't just in the food.  This is a great place to go with colleagues after a day at the office.  Nice ambiance, nice patio (if you don't get a smoker next to you), mostly friendly staff.  Convenient location."}
{"text":"Great tasting burger!  Say it like Samuel Jackson in Pulp Fiction.... royale with cheese!  Good stuff."}
{"text":"The review is for takeout with skipthedishes. The portions are small for the price and food is very plain. Like $8 to add shrimp and scallops to a salad?   Also a piece of salmon with rice and asparagus ran a bill of 25+ The salmon only had a salt and pepper taste, and was really dry/over-cooked. That was pretty pricey for just 3 ingredients in the meal. The rice was a small clump and there were a few asparagus. In the restaurant such a dish wouldn't even be plateable.   They also didn't pack any utensils or napkins, or even bags. So the poor delivery person had to precariously stack boxes and make several trips to deliver all the food. Overall would not recommend."}
{"text":"My last visit to Earl's was beyond surprising. I have to be honest and say that I've never actually been a fan of Earl's, yet most recently, Earl's managed to surprise me. Instead of opting for full meals, me and my cohorts shared three appetizers, all of which I would order again. The first, was the dynamite rolls. Obviously not the best sushi I've ever had, but surprisingly good. The second, was an order of fish tacos. And ohmygosh, the fish tacos are ama-z-ing. Shockingly amazing. I felt like I was eating the best food truck fare of the West (or East?) coast. SO GOOD. The third appetizer was the spinach and artichoke dip. Also incredible. I highly recommend it.  I also have to say that I don't like mojitos. Ever. They're like downing a bottle of listerine. Yet, magically the waitress talked me into a raspberry mojito, claiming that she also doesn't like the traditional drink. Well, I have to say, I was more than surprised and will be ordering that again... well done Earl's."}
{"text":"I came here on Sunday for my birthday and had a great experience! I called a few other places like Cactus Club and Joey Chinook to see if they could get me in, but Joey's was full and Cactus gave me a bit of a run around, so I was stoked to find out that Earl's could accommodate my friends and I! We were placed on the patio which was super cozy and warm under the heaters. The food and drinks were great as usual, however, our server was super slow and didn't come around too often. Which wouldn't usually be a problem, but we were mainly there for drinks! Overall, excellent experience:)"}
{"text":"This places really gone downhill. Was there this past Saturday night and it was only half full. Got seated quick enough but our app order was brought wrong... two of the same appetizer even though we clearly only ordered one.  Steak special order was terrible for $30 & after when I tried telling my server....the dimwit thought I was complimenting the food"}
{"text":"Same as always it was awesome ...  the burger was tasty, since it was Wednesday nice offer on beers on tap for 5$..."}
{"text":"Big group went out for a Christmas lunch party.  I know that big groups can always be difficult and I know we were a rowdy bunch.  Over all the food was good we had one of the meals get sent back but every thing else was good but nothing that really said wow."}
{"text":"Love the very spacious and bright patio of this Earl's on King.  I like that when I am sitting at the patio, I am surrounded by all those tall downtown office buildings.  Sometimes, I do need that relaxing and contemporary city life feeling.  Very \"Suits\" feel, lol.  I have not tried their food on main menu yet.  I came here few times and ordered only their food and drinks on bar menu.  They were all on or above average.   The service was quite ok and friendly.  The $5 features on Suns to Thurs in the Summer seems a good deal.  Unfortunately, I usually escape from downtown right away after work :("}
{"text":"Earls is always a good choice when we don't know where to eat. I've probably had everything on their menu and there's nothing I've been disappointed by as of yet at any earls location!   I highly recommend the spinach dip with pita bread ( some give you it with the chips.. but you can ask for the pita bread) it's also very filling so if you want to make it to your main course I don't recommend finishing it.   The Santa-fe salad with chicken is amazing!  Mediterranean linguini is amazing  Pesto pizza is good  The Thai chicken bites are really good The Alfredo is not bad  You basically just can't go wrong with their food"}
{"text":"I fell here for my 19th birthday. Great service, and food. The Fettuccine Alfredo, the garlic fries, and their mojitos are to die for. Will always be my favourite restaurant :)"}
{"text":"We had the best experience! Megan was the best bartender and answered all of our questions! Tyler was also amazing and making sure that we had everything we needed and checking in frequently!! Will be returning :)"}
{"text":"Earl's?  5 stars?  Say what?  YES, and I'll tell you why:  This Earl's is open until 3AM 7 days a week.    Full bar.  Full kitchen.  Drinks are $4 after 10PM.  We're in our 30's and we like to drink, this is the shit I consider important..  Nothing more God damn annoying than going into a bar after midnight just to have them tell you \"Oh sorry, we're doing last call now\" or \"We're closed\" or worse yet \"sorry no food\"  Food is quite acceptable at Earl's albeit expensive, but honestly I'm perfectly happy being able to order crispy shrimp dynamite rolls, craft beers and shots of whisky for $4 at 1:30 AM on a Sunday night/Monday morning if I see fit!  This place is a gem that never closes early.  5 STARS"}
{"text":"Very disappointing last visit. Our group ordered the calamari and clam chowder to start, the 6 oz steak for main. Calamari portion was half of what we expected. Two of the 6 oz steaks were overcooked -- when we asked our waitress, she basically said that's how it's done. Won't be back again, especially when there are so many other choices close by."}
{"text":"Sat at outdoor patio here, gas heaters made it pleasant. Only issue was the service took quite a long time as the place was packed. It was like a Saturday night in here. Getting our wine ,we had to ask 3 times.   The food was good, had the Ribs & Blackened Chicken dinner.   Bring your patience when coming here."}
{"text":"The first Earls I ever went to was in Edmonton. I had a fantastic experience there and thought this would be the same - Not so much. Came here for a friend's birthday last night.  Food is good - on par with Edmonton. Loved the fig brie chicken sandwich. The chocolate cake was to die for. I give the food a  B+. There's three areas where you can sit and have a meal - the patio, lounge (has a big screen tv), and the dining room. We sat in the dining room. The ambience was nice - definitely a place to take a date. I give the atmosphere an B+ (better than the one I went to at west Edmonton Mall).   What left an uber bad taste in my mouth was THE STAFF. They were unfriendly, cold and rude. Ruined our entire experience. Don't take someone here to celebrate a birthday - apparently, not only do they not have complimentary slices of cake, they do not have candles or sparklers to put on a paid dessert for a birthday guest - as the hostess told me \"it's not something they do\".  I got the impression that \"celebrating birthdays\" were beyond this Earl's scope of sophistication. The waitress came once in awhile to see how we were doing, but overall, we did not feel the welcoming vibe that would make this a birthday-licious experience.   Having good staff could really make or break a dining experience. Perhaps, I would go back since I like the food and the price is reasonable, but the staff really need to take a course in customer service.  Unfortunately, this is the only location in Toronto. Maybe I'll give the Mississauga location a whirl."}
{"text":"Great bar in a good location to grab a bite, watch some sports, have a pint, and get together with your besties.  We popped in before catching a movie at tiff and the service was quick. I liked the cajun chicken cheddar sandwich. It was a smallish meal which was exactly what I wanted. Even the side of fries was just enough. So often, fry sides are ridiculous. Then the next thing you know, you've had way more than you really need. (There were bigger choices if you do need, though.) Casual and relaxed place."}
{"text":"My favorite destination in Toronto.  Friendly and attentive servers and great atmosphere.  I've been a few times and this past visit was disappointed with my burger (the server recommended a few dishes, but not the burger so naturally I had to go with the burger) - it had no taste and when I was asked about it I told the server so.  I was surprised when she comped me the burger, even though I had eaten it.  Full bar, wide selection of beers, and am expansive menu.  The place fills up early for a reason."}
{"text":"The reputation that precedes this restaurant, is ALL TRUE. I went here for brunch - I wasn't too keen traveling near work on an off day but I heard about this place often enough that I got my lazy ass downtown. Thank goodness for my naggy friend who dragged me here, otherwise , I dare say, I would have been incomplete.  What I love most: the open, lofty ambiance. it seems that because we're all so conscious of having \"privacy\" it brought a slew of high-boothed restaurants, with dim lights. I'm not a fan of eating in the darkness, but that's just me. So it was nice to be at a place that have decent amount of lighting, open air ambiance.  THE FOOD? ORGASMIC.  I had the Bronx burger and salad, which came with a delicious \"simple vinaigrette\" - sooo good -I  think I licked the dressing off. I'm not a burger person - any one will tell you.  But i stuffed myself with all of this burger and it's massive real onion rings, covered in all sorts of grease , and risked major itis(we did sit in the restaurant for quite some time after) - it was JUST THAT GOOD.  If you have yet visited this place, YOU need to go."}
{"text":"Came here at 11 am on a saturday morning and for some reason the place was not open. However the staff was really ncie and let me and my 8 friends in here to watch tv while we waited for it to open. We ended up getting really wild in here and teh bar staff was more then tolerable. They were tolerable probably becasue we went over to mcdonalds across the street and bought everyone in the bar including the staff burgers. Good times and great service. Overall this place is a classy place,,,,unless me and my friends are in there."}
{"text":"Always friendly service and consistent food at this location. Today food was fast and delicious. The server however was very slow to provide our table the bill."}
{"text":"Food is always tasty and fresh the times I have been. The tempura sushi roll is surprisingly very good for a non Japanese restaurant. My fav dish is the Cajun Chicken Sandwich always cooked to perfection. The staff here from host to server are very friendly."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant chain as it offers consistent food and service.   This location allowed reservations during weekday.   Ambience is lively and loud. Tables are relatively close to one another but no big deal.   Service was sub par for this visit where food from sit down to order took 65 minutes but restaurant was super busy but had trouble handling table of 8 of us.   Dynamite roll unavailable for 30 minutes was sorta funny.   Overall still come back but in smaller group."}
{"text":"Earls is one of my fav Canadian restaurant chains.   Consistent food. Friendly service.   Menu has great variety from apps to salads to sandwiches to stir fry to pizza to entree such as steak.   Large wine and beer selection.   Great place for family and friends.   Overall this location is smaller than others but has a bar side and patio outside.    If you enjoy Earls and restaurant with very good food can't beat it."}
{"text":"Friendly service and atmosphere is great.   Menu has been tweaked over the years and remains similar with hot wings, calamari and dry ribs as the staple apps. Love the dynamite prawn + mango rolls.   Main courses have the classic burger and my fav the Cajun chicken sandwich.   Tacos are good and the Chicken Hunan Kung Pao been here forever.   4 star only has their mains and steaks are average for what you pay."}
{"text":"It's a good place to go for a bite. Average taste average menu. They could do better with menu selection."}
{"text":"Earl's is one of my favourite restaurants. I went two times in the last 3 weeks and had a great experience every time. The service was amazing, our waiter was so kind. The food was so good. I definitely recommend the Chicken Alfredo Linguini plate, so flavourful and delicious. The music choice makes the restaurant so inviting. The washrooms are clean. Would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I came on a Wednesday night around 5:30 because the new bar next door was full. A convenient choice if you don't want to walk too far from the PATH, but definitely better food & value elsewhere.  Patio was full so we sat inside near the lounge. It is pretty loud inside.   DRINK: Lime Mojito - good, not too strong  FOOD: Baja Fish Tacos w. side of yam fries. Taste was acceptable but it was cold."}
{"text":"It had been 20 years since I'd been in an earl's, so I wasn't sure what I should expect from it when I walked in a few weeks ago.   Overall I'd say I wasn't let down. The food was pretty good. My two friends and I all got steak. Not on purpose, but between the three of us we got the 6, 8 and 10oz steaks. All three cuts. As sides we all chose mushrooms, mashed potatoes and they ordered shrimp. I don't eat shrimp, but was told it was good. The mashed potatoes I have to say, were amazing. The mushrooms were also quite good. The steak was cooked as I'd asked. It wasn't spectacular, but I'd say it was very good.   Our server was polite and chatted briefly with us. She didn't seem to want to be there and it showed, but she was fairly prompt and smiled which in the age of lowered expectations on service, is actually pretty good!  Overall very happy with the food, don't know if I'd pay $70 for a meal and two gin and tonics again...but I'd still say it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"Went on monday and there was a but if a wait for the dining room for the lounge side and got seated immediately. We ordered the boodle bowl wity the option of choosing the heat level by adding the desired no of hot peppers and the curry bowl with jasmine rice and fresh naan ! The food was all devine and great prices( 15 $ a meal) we also had two drinks from the drink menu and the bills were around 30 each! Service was really quick and all the staff was nice and really quick to take/ serve orders, water refills etc!!! Definetely plan on returning !!!"}
{"text":"The very first time that I came here was during my birthday. It was not a disappointment at all and I am very satisfied with the overall experience. All of the staff were nice, the place was convenient, and the food was just great! My friends ordered salads, pastas and burgers and they all loved it! I did not hear one complain from them about the food that they ordered. I had the chicken curry and it was amazing!  I also tried their jerk chicken and their cajun chicken and I loved both of them. Always torn between those two every time I visit! The jerk chicken is spicy though (as it should be) so if you aren't into spicy food, try the cajun chicken!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch with a friend,and was approached right away, very nice and friendly server, got our drinks right away, then waited way way too long to get out order in, our server was helping several tables while 5 other servers and/or hosts, are talking in the front desk. Our server was good but, when there are that many people working, there should never be any excuse for poor service, intentions are there, but no follow through. Disappointed Today! Food was good,as always!"}
{"text":"Food is always 4 to 4.5 stars, it's the service that gets me, it starts off well, but I don't know if it's this location but the servers don't follow up fast enough, or often enough, today I had to ask for a refill on my drink, that should not happen, well I had to get up and go ask. But earls is still one of my favorites, it deserves a 4.5 overall if the service improves for me, as for the food, love everything on the menu esp The Cajun Chicken is amazing and also with the Caesar Salad, or even the Cajun sandwich, love all Cajun!"}
{"text":"The food here is over priced and the service was not that great. The waitress didn't come to check up on us to see how we are doing after we finished our order. She just mostly talk to us after she gave us our food. Food is over priced and not worth the $$. Go to a better place to get better food and portions.I would never go back here again. I ordered the Bronx Burger for $16 which is over priced and nothing special. Don't plan to come here again and wasted $88 with tax and tips for 2 enntree, 1 beer and 1 appetizer. Only liked the chicken brie, garden salad and shrimp sushi rolls. The rest of the food is just ok, and way over priced. Service was only DECENT."}
{"text":"Definitely worth checking out if you're downtown. Good selection of Canadian beers (Steamwhistle, et. al) combined with great food and an even better scene makes Earl's a personal favorite. Great for catching up with old friends or a business dinner."}
{"text":"Today I am disappointed with this place. Jeera curry isn't great, no veggies just rice, naan and chicken in a good sauce. The waiter was the best part of the experience. Sorry Earls... This time you didn't do it for me. The gingerbread, apples and ice cream is just right though. I WILL be back! Usually 5 stars out of five."}
{"text":"Really disappointing experience at Earls as far as the food quality goes. The raspberry and strawberry lemonade did not resemble any lemonade that I've tasted. This occasion was my mothers birthday and they had no sort of birthday accommodation available. Also, the soy sauce used in my meal was excessive and overpowered the rest of my stir fry. The menu (especially for drinks) also seems to generally be incomplete and I found myself asking the waiter frequently if they had something.  On the positive side, the ambience of the restaurant is top notch and the waiters are friendly."}
{"text":"Insisted on coming here tonight with a couple of girlfriends for my belated birthday dinner! Earl's is home to one of my favourite salads ever - the Santa Fe Chicken Salad! I've had it at three different locations and it is exceptional every time. The blackened chicken is really what makes it!   Would have given a 5 star rating except for the fact that we were sitting slightly close to the front door and a freezing cold draft came through every time the door opened. Would recommend sitting closer to the bar to avoid this. Other than that, a very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Definitely a step up from the other Earls in the city in terms of the swanky decor. In general I find Earls to be overpriced and fairly blas√©, but we had a gift card, and I was pleasantly surprised!   Our waitress was really nice and again went above my expectations for Earls. She was very helpful and came around quite frequently, though we had to ask to have our waters refilled several times.  We started with the thai chicken and wontons; they are always very good and a classic Earls dish in my opinion. My husband had the seasonal curry sable fish for dinner. It was really good but not worth the $30 we forked over for it, in both taste and portion size. I had the seasonal warm kale salad and it was very large and was super tasty and unique. We also had raspberry lime sodas; they were generous in size and really good for $4 each. We also split a banana cream pie for dessert (also seasonal) which was delicious aside from the burnt caramel popcorn on top (we just took it off).   Like I said, for an Earls, I was pleasantly surprised and definitely preferred the nice decor here over other locations in the city."}
{"text":"Went with a group of family that hadn't gotten together in a while, a party of 7. We made the mistake of going on a Friday night.  No one could hear anything anyone said over the DEAFENING music!  Also they wait staff, however friendly took forever to take care of us.  They don't take reservations either, so you have to get there early and wait out for a table. Calamari Appetizer was quite delicious, nice batter coating. Spinach Feta Dip was not so great, too onion-y. As for entries, mediocre at best.  Someone ordered the crab pasta, but there was no actual crab in it, just shrimp!  When we asked the waitress she said they only put a little crab in, despite the menu item being called Alaskan Crab Linguini.  Nothing was offered to us in terms of a discount or a different dish either. In conclusion, everyone left with a headache and an unsettled stomach."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at this particular Earl's. The food is pretty good - I especially like the chicken, apple, brie sandwich. The chicken quesadilla was a bit of a disappointment, however - wouldn't recommend that one. The salad and yam fries are yummy. And I like their curry bowl with chicken. Prices are a *little* on the high side but service is usually fairly average and they're a friendly bunch."}
{"text":"For this restaurant, review by aspect is more appropriate:  Food: 3 out of 5 stars. NY Striploin was good but expensive ($32.50) for a 12oz and overcooked for my request of medium (some burn on surface and not pink in the middle).  Atmosphere: 4 out of 5 stars. Great outdoor seating but near road so lots of road noise.  Service: 5 out of 5 stars. Responsive, friendly, professional service.  Eye candy qualities of hostesses and waitresses: 7 out of 5 stars. The outfits are hot and the wearers of the outfits are hotter. And as the day gets warmers, they start taking off the layers. Where do they find these women?  Overall: 4 out of 5."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with a colleague on Wednesday, this place is located centrally within the Financial District and reservations are recommended as it fills up quickly for lunch. We sat on the patio and enjoyed catching up, nibbling on shareables and having a glass of wine. We ordered their sweet potatoe fries which were salted and perfectly crispy. We also had their fish tacos which had a delicious salsa and their Korean spicy wings. They definitely had a kick to them! The service was quick, attentive and friendly as well. A great option for lunch in the downtown core!"}
{"text":"After being closed for almost 8 months after the flood this location has bounced back strong. The new decor and layout is great and the service has been excellent both times I've been here since their re-open.  Earl's lost me for many years as I found nothing really differentiated them from other places like Joey, Moxies, Milestones, etc. Now it seems like they've rebuffed their menu and given things a twist that sets them a little bit apart from their main competition.   On both visits I had the crispy prawns. I love the flavour but love even more that when the menu says that they're spicy, they actually are spicy. On my second visit last weekend I went with the ribs. They were nice and tender and fell off the bone. Also worth mentioning are the pork buns."}
{"text":"I have had Earls in Calgary  its was ok I have fell in love with Earls at Square One. I love the Mediterranean Linguini I have tried cooking it myself at home it so good! It has never worked out to be as good as the restaurant. If you are shopping and need a good meal stop in here before you go home for the night"}
{"text":"I had the Jeera Chicken Curry it was good. the environment wasn't what I expected"}
{"text":"Leona, Danielle and Jennifer's reviews say it all. Just went there with five business colleagues for lunch -- we knew it is crazy busy at lunch so two of us showed up at 1120 am. The staff at the door were very accomodating and found us an excellent table for six.   Talked with Tamika our server who is cute as a button and very, very nice. I had a Guinness (perfectly poured) and my buddy had the recommended Albino Rhino draft. Our friends arrived and we ate like kings. Superb service and excellent food. I had the Bronx Burger, which is a massive burger, mozzarella and three homemade onion rings with a side of fries. Tamika suggested I eat a ring, then flatten it to eat it. Worked like a charm. We'll all be back."}
{"text":"A bit of a tough call. It is definitely loud and very busy at peak evening times. Service can be hit or miss depending on how busy they are or whether they think your alcohol order will be big enough to yield a large tip or not.  That being said, this is a great place to meet friends after work, particularly if the well-apportioned patio is open and the weather is nice.  The food here is very good. You can find common things such as a delicious bacon cheddar burger or other sandwiches. They also have some Asian inspired dishes that might seem a bit out of place on the menu, but are also well worth trying.  They have a great selection of wine and a number of beers on draught as well.  The chocolate dessert with ice cream, as well as the key lime pie are larger than average and quite delicious. If you want a dessert, but are not starving, share this one."}
{"text":"I will never again return here and I will be sure to let all my friends, family, and clients know to avoid this place. The treatment and service we received was abysmal. If Alexis can't handle her section, move her. She was blatantly rude, ignoring us when we asked continuously to pay for our bill. We waited 45 minutes to PAY our bill. I don't know if it's because we're women or we're coloured but I see exactly how this works. What a waste of my time, money, and effort. Never again. It does not take this long to settle up a bill. As a former server, I can't even imagine treating my customers the way she did with us."}
{"text":"Was in town and wanted to grab a bite somewhere local and trendy.  This place hit both points square in the mouth.  Trendy, yes, with walls of repurposed wood, combined with metal accent and leather seating.  The outdoor patio looked to be the place to hang out if you're looking to mingle amongst the happy hour work crowd.  Our party decided to stay inside and enjoy dinner so that's what we did.  The food was delicious and the beer selection had a nice variety to it.  Service was spot on and that is saying a lot considering the crowd of folks there.  As far as parking, I'm not sure of where but I assume there is a parking deck nearby and possibly even street parking."}
{"text":"I have been before and the vibe is great but this time it took 45 to get our order taken...which is kind of ridiculous.  We were not offered drinks either...just water.  I ordered the chicken, Brie and fig sandwich and it was super tasty!"}
{"text":"A popular after-work location in the downtown core.. Luckily, we had made reservations and didn't have to join the waiting crowds for a table. They have an extensive drinks list, and the waiters are happy to point out options if your poison of choice isn't available. The Bees Knees signature cocktail caught my eye, mostly due to the incredibly cute cup. Unfortunately, the drink itself is quite small (like the height of a juice box) so I probably won't order it again.   I tried out their Cajun Prawns with Garlic Bread as a light dinner (tt's meant as an appetizer). Around 10 prawns come charred in a spicy slightly-smoky sauce with a large wedge of fluffy bread on the side. They paired well together, and a squeeze of lime on top helped to brighten the heavier flavors.   The space is dimly lit, with leather chairs, wood tables, and rustic rope details as accents. Loud music drowns out the crowds, but also makes it hard to hold a conversation. We spent most of the night yelling over the music to hear each other. So either sit close together or keep the conversation between the people next to you, otherwise you will have a sore voice by the end of the night. Also, there are drink specials everyday of the week, so check it out on a day that works for you."}
{"text":"Great food and customer service.  It's connected to the mall so it's a convenient restaurant to go to.  I only gave it 3 stars because I personally like the Earls at the Financial District a bit more."}
{"text":"Late night supper. Eh, what's this? The menu has been visibly pared down to just one (large) page. Spatchcock chicken was recommended. Took the advice, glad I did. It. Was. Delicious! The peanut sauce it was served with was exploding with flavour. Must come back to try new menu items. Service was excellent, too."}
{"text":"I had the Chicken Mediterranean Linguini. Taste excellent - bit spicy balanced with a touch of baby tomatoes (sweet). Chicken well seasoned. My only concerned was the portion of pasta was too much. I would rather liked to have more chicken and less pasta. Also, maybe it was just me but the pasta could have been softer.  Food   Presentation: 7/10   Taste: 8.5/10   Overall: 7.5/10  Atmosphere: 8/10 Service: Quick. They tried as much as they could to fit the 14 of us. 9/10"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This review is based on my lunch experience so if you're looking for dinner reviews this isn't it..  I was asked here by a few friends who work in the area and we just had lunch today. The service is fast and great. Very friendly, prompt seating and which to take orders/ bring the food.  I'm disappointed though with my food.I ordered the kung pao noodles ( yes I know mistake ordering noodles here but they didn't have any other vegetarian options) with tofu added for $3 bringing the total to $17.50 for a plate of noodles with veggies and glorified soy sauce.  The tofu was burnt. Black actually on one side. Not sure if that's how they serve it or it was burnt for my taste but it tastes gross. I actually left it out.  The veggies and noodles were meh. Nothing to repeat.I actually came craving their veggie burger but looks like they pulled it off the menu? Why!!!   My friends ordered tacos and burgers. The tacos were too small in portion. Burger got rave reviews.  I will not be repeating my visit....."}
{"text":"Had a late dinner at the bar. Bartender provided great service. I order the chimichurri steak, it was cooked to perfection! Excellent seasoning and flavor! I ate a morton's steakhouse the night before and had a steak that was double the price that didn't even compare to the one at Earl's."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday. The server was very patient with our party due to late comers. She was very attentive and sweet. She processed and got our order out ASAP. I ordered the steak & sushi: I felt like my dynamite roll was a little over cooked, the breaded shrimp was a little darker than the traditional colour... as well for the steak, I asked for medium and it came out more like medium well. The flavour was there except it was spicy. There was no indication on the menu that it would be. The drink to die for, the frozen pink lemonade. I ordered two, one for the birthday girl and one for me, somehow one of the drink ended up on her bill... umm... when it was suppose to be my treat to her. Overall, it was a decent place to have a gathering and enjoy other companies."}
{"text":"We came for a pre show dinner. Hubby and son were in a rush to get to Raptors game but my niece and I had time as we were seeing a show at the Living Arts Centre across the street. We started with the avocado toast which was nice and had a slight kick due to the sriracha. They could not make it gluten free. Hubby had the kung pao chicken and noodles. He said it was tasty but did not have enough chicken. The server offered to get more chicken for him but he said no as he was in a rush. He got spice level 4 but said it was not spicy enough. Son got the half rack ribs and Cajun chicken. He said the chicken was very good but ribs were just ok. He did not like the potato salad but subbed the garlic fries for the coleslaw and he enjoyed the fries. Niece had the salmon dinner with rice and asparagus and really enjoyed that. I got the veggie burger, no cheese, no bun with garlic fries. Both were very tasty. My niece ordered a chocolate toffee pudding which was decadent and it came with ice cream in a bowl made of crispy caramel. It was her birthday celebration so they put a candle in it....but it was full price. Since we ate around 5pm, we got the avo toast for the happy hour price but everything else was on the expensive side. The decor was nice and the washrooms were also nice but toilets did not flush well. Server was nice but often hard to find as the restaurant filled up very quickly shortly after we arrived."}
{"text":"Earl's is my go to place when looking for a meal I can count on. The staff is always friendly and efficient. The price is fair and the selection is awesome. There are some things that bring their score down such as their ambiance. It's beautiful and romantic to dim the lights, but they dim them so much to the point I need to always take my phone out to read the menu. It's also always extremely loud in there. The music is turned up pretty loud which makes everyone talk louder. Overall, I think everyone should try Earl's at least once, the cranberry chicken sandwich is to die for!"}
{"text":"Our server was great, the main course could have been better but the dessert and mixed drinks were good.  If you ever go there ask to be served by Sam.  He was great and was fast even during dinner time when it tends to get really busy."}
{"text":"Had lunch here twice with clients and this place never disappointed me. I had their Albino Rhino Wheat which was dee-lish. Burgers are great, chicken salad was super fresh and so was their seafood. I didn't get to try their spicy caesar but my colleague had it and I'm sold to get it in my next visit."}
{"text":"I normally love earls. This was the first time at this location. The good WAS delicious but the portions were seriously half what you get at any other earls. The service was embarrassing. 4 hostesses just standing around not even offering you water while you wait 25 minutes.  Finally get seated and took another 10 before our waitress even came to take our order for drinks. Another  5 before those even came. Those were the only drinks we saw all night. No refills. Our appetisers finally came after 35 minutes which were barely half of what you'd normally get at earls. Never saw our waitress for another 40 minutes when our entrees came out which did taste delicious but could have been because we were starving. I have sympathy for restaurants on busy nights but our waitress didn't even try to come by and help us. Will definitely not return to this location again."}
{"text":"Whoever is currently working hostess is incompetent and rude and should not be in customer service.   I asked for a table for two, and the blond hostess then told me to sit at the bar at the lounge. I assumed that it was because there was no space; however, there were many empty tables in the dining area and one booth and one table available in the lounge.   I went back and asked to be placed at a table because I was unsure if the booth and single table were reserved around, to which she replied that I could eat at the bar. I again insisted that I wanted to eat at a table because the chairs were not comfortable and the only empty seats were in a high traffic area, to which she became rude and patronizing, laughing, \"Oh, you want to have a REAL meal. Please SHOW ME EXACTLY where you would like to sit. You can eat ANYWHERE.\"  Of course, I stormed out, went back into the lounge at the only table left where my friend was, sat for about five minutes where not one single server came to our table (probably because our seat wasn't logged into OpenTable seeing as, you know, we were thrown into a bar seat), ordered a drink at the bar, and left.   I come here frequently for birthdays and anniversaries and this is the first time I've ever been treated with utmost disrespect. Absolutely disgusting customer service from a hostess who utterly undermines an otherwise great establishment. Needless to say, I will not be recommending this place to anybody, nor will I be coming back."}
{"text":"Until recently I had only ever been to Earls for late night, off the cuff drinks and had never sat down for a deliberate, proper meal. Then a few Fridays ago I found myself there for dinner with my coworkers. I was pleasantly surprised to find a number of vegetarian options listen on their website but presumed they would be mediocre at best. I subsequently found my expectations were blown out of the water.  Earls has a number of drink specials during the week (even on Fridays!). I ordered a bees knees cocktail (gin based) which came in an adorable bear shaped glass with a honeypot stirrer. Delicious, very Instagram-worthy and a bargain at $8. We then snacked on some salt and pepper crusted truffle fries. They were SO SO good we could barely stop ourselves from devouring them instantly. We then ended up staying for dinner and I ordered a fairly recent menu addition - the mushroom bolognese. It was phenomenal. I can't recall another pasta dish I have enjoyed so much in recent years. It was hearty and filling like your standard bolognese but completely vegetarian.  After this visit to Earls I couldn't stop raving about the food to anyone who would listen. I subsequently found myself back there multiple times in the next few weeks. I ate and drank all of the above again and it was just as good the second and third times. My friends were equally surprised and impressed by the quality of these food items. I also tried an old fashioned and a Bellini. The former was great but the latter was a strange interpretation of the drink - a frozen, blended thing that was very sweet and contained syrup. I advised my server of this and she was more than happy to exchange it for me free of charge.  Earls does have a certain reputation for midweek shenanigans and attracting a certain Suits crowd. In addition all of the servers could pass for Victoria's Secret models. However if you are looking for a nice, decently sized place with good quality food downtown and a nice vibe I highly recommend it. I hope their patio (which is currently under renovation) opens in time for summer."}
{"text":"I returned for a lunch meet up.  The food was delicious yet expensive, just like last visit.  The services was notably faster than last time, so I upgrade the rating to 3 stars."}
{"text":"We visited Earls on my most recent birthday - April 14.  After entering, we stood at the hostess stand.  A few staff members walked by and smiled, but no one stopped or talked to us.  Five minutes later, we were getting antsy.  More people had walked by, but no one said a word.  After ten minutes, we decided to give it five more and then go.  Finally someone came (with one minute to go!) and asked if we were being helped.  We said no, and he left.  We were seated around five minutes later when someone else came.    While it took a while to be seated, things went fairly smoothly after that.  We ordered appetizers and drinks, which arrived promptly and were very good.  The problem was our waiter (Gregory) stank so much that it made us both gag.  He had obviously stepped out for a cigarette right before our appetizer course and hadn't washed his hands or popped a mint or anything.  The smoke smell clung to him horribly and ruined our appetites.  I've worked in service and there are ways to mitigate your smell if you smoke; this was so unprofessional.  Our meals arrived, thankfully brought by a food runner, so we had a break from the waiter.  The meals were wonderful; 5 stars for the food!  Zero stars for the service, from start to finish.  So kudos to the kitchen staff here, it's a shame that your front of the house staff isn't more on the ball."}
{"text":"We meant to go to the keg with another couple, but because of the snow lastnight for whatever reason there was at least a 45 minute wait there.  Starved, we all headed over to earls where we were sat immediately.  Our server was clearly new but she did a great job, when she didn't know something she was quick to find out.  Props to her!  All four of us had burgers, no apps.  Everything on the apps menu just seemed carb loaded and not really food we were ready to eat before the rest of the menu items...I've checked out there nutrition on the site, and there's only one less than 1000 cals item on their menu.    That being said, after our burgers which we all finished and deemed good, (but not big smoke great) we were enjoying the atmosphere enough we sat for another hour and a bit having drinks.  I think their wine menu is over priced, and I'm still waiting for a place that has great cocktails in the city for under 9 dollars, but we had a great night lastnight.  We will be back.  Ps...yeeeears ago in Victoria earls used to have a veggie lasagna that was uh may zing...would've loved to have seen that!"}
{"text":"Earls is awesome.  I entertain clients there all the time; the atmosphere, food, drinks and service deliver every time.  My favourite part of menu is the apps, they're all awesome and funny enough the prawn roll is one of the best rolls I've ever had.  Their burgers and bar food are also excellent but I stay away from the steaks and fish as I find there usually lacking."}
{"text":"It has been a while since visiting this location due to a catastrophic meltdown last time. Well, we received some gift cards for Earl's and decided that a dinner would be in order this evening. First of all the reception was prompt and genuine and since there were only two we had  table right away. Interestingly enough the service was very attentive (server Chelsea) and there was a manager cruising the tables asking people how their meals were - for some reason he did not ask us.  The menu has changed with interesting new items: the Bronx burger which has onion rings stacked in with the patty - so bad but it was so good. Chilli chicken is always flavourful and a nice app to start with for a few people. Since I was on the water (driver) I am told the bellinis (adult slurpees) are very good and have the proper amount of 'slushiness'.  The one major drawback of this evening is something that Earl's has control over - other people's bratty, spoiled and undisciplined children. Yuppie mommy and daddy bring their evil spawns into a spot at a time that is typically adult and we all have to watch and listen to the spectacle that these brats perform. AND, parents are either blind, deaf and dumb (or D - all of the above) and do nothing to intervene!  Earl - ban kids after 5pm everyday! Tell Yuppie mommy and daddy that CHUCKEE CHEESE is in the N.E. part of town."}
{"text":"Love it.  Cajun chicken is super good.  Would also recommend the chicken and ribs combo.  Can't lose"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Very friendly staff. Nice pace and the food was very good. Chicken, brie and fig sandwich tasty. Sticky toffee chocolate pudding was divine. Good choice to come in here"}
{"text":"My friend had a gift card for this place so he decided to treat me and my other friend for dinner. When I walked in, I was surprised the whole place seemed really nice and had a great ambience to it. I really liked the whole set up. We were seated very quickly and our waiter was very friendly. We all ordered the 6oz steak, which tasted a bit salty at first but when you eat it with the veggies and the mashed potatoes it helps cut that. The portion of it was a great size, not too big and not too small. I will definitely come back to try the bronx burger haha and would recommend this place to other people. The pricing was also not that bad so it won't cause a dent to your wallet. :)"}
{"text":"a wonderful place to eat at that has a casual fancy feel! food was delicious - had ordered yam fries and hot wings as our appetizer and our main courses comprised mostly of chicken (a cajun chicken burger, cajun chicken with potato salad side, chicken tacos and Alfredo chicken fettuccine with ros√© sauce). Our server was very nice and friendly and gave wonderful service.   Though this place was great, there wasn't anything too special about it! Just a regular dinner restaurant:)"}
{"text":"I luv it here. I've never had a problem with the food, or the service. I like the atmosphere, the hours they keep, and most importantly, the food. P.S. Try the Cajun Blackened Chicken ;$"}
{"text":"Located on the bottom floor of Square One near the Walmart entrance. We dined here on a super busy evening just after Christmas. We had a large party but did't wait too long to be seated which was a plus. Keep in mind that this is the best restaurant in Square One in terms of quality and service so the prices are higher than what you would expect.  I ordered the vegeterian burger and it was good quality, i really enjoyed it. Everyone else loved their dishes and service was spot on as well.  Some of the cons are that portion sizes are on the small side and if you sit near the front entrance in the winter it gets cold when the door is opened."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on the weekend in February. I guess the secret is out that all items on their brunch menu is for $8 each! The reason I'm giving four stars is because we weren't expecting the portions to be big cause it was 8 bucks. But it was actually normal sized (and I couldn't finish my order!) and tasted great. The customer service was also attentive, although I noticed they were seating some walk-ins first instead of those who made reservations and were waiting on the couch to be seated. Not a big deal as the experience overall was still quite pleasant."}
{"text":"Went with a group of girlfriends for brunch. The patio is gorgeous on a sunny day! The $20 pitchers are great for a group, and we had their mango mint margaritas and it was yummy! The brunch food is limited in its options. A few of us ordered the avocado toast with poached eggs and a side salad, but were not too impressed. The salad was average, the toast was quiet hard and difficult to cut, and my eggs were actually cold within 2 minutes of arriving. Might be a better choice for happy hour or an early evening gig post work.."}
{"text":"Can Earls please let us Ontarian's know if they serve Ontario or Canadian Raised without Antibiotic or hormones beef in the Ontario Restaurants.?I come from a farming background and I was informed that not all steaks and beef served in Ontario Restaurants may be Canadian.I lived in Calgary when the Albertan farmers were angered by Earls decision to use USA beef and I genuinely hope that my fears are put to ease and that Earls in fact only use CDN beef.I love going to Earls Restaurant and hope to continue going but will definitely not be returning if in fact we are mislead by clever wording by calling out CDN burgers while in fact most of the rest of the menu may not be CDN Product.Can Earls please clarify?"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and friendly bar tender.  Was amazed with the very catchy and unique menu they had. I personally went with the sweet and spicy chicken with wontons. Was a great choice.   The decor is right on. From the main room to the side room and even the wash rooms.   Fairly priced as well. Will be back in the future."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch as we had some errands to run in Square One and upon discovering Earl's offered brunch, thought we would give it a try.  Decor is nice.  Greeted by friendly doorstaff who offered us (party of 2) the choice of regular table or booth.  Limited brunch menu. We each chose the Eggs Florentine in a parmesan cream sauce.  This is served on polenta with spinach and mushrooms as a garnish.  4 small wedges of sourdough bread, accompany the dish.   The food was delicious.  We both really enjoyed every last bit.  The portion sizes are good; perhaps a little more bread would have been nice to sop up some of the cream sauce.    So why the 3 star rating?  When ordering our selections, the waitress gave a detailed explanation of how Earl's prepares Eggs Florentine different than other restaurants.  She described it as a 'wet dish' and that the eggs are served atop of wet 'placenta'.  Placenta.  She said it about 4 times.  The dish is listed as being served on POLENTA.  We all make mistakes in life, but really, most of your egg dishes are served on POLENTA so I would think you would be clear on polenta vs placenta.  I'm sorry but she should learn the menu and the ingredients and find a better way to describe a patron's meal than a 'wet dish'.  We were starving so thankfully the food was delish and we forgot the nauseated feeling experienced by her description of the meal being a wet dish served on top of placenta in a parmesan cream sauce.  Yack.  Side note - service was slow.  After asking for the bill, we had to wait about 10 minutes and make motions like we were getting up before she produced it.  Upon receiving our orders, we asked for hot sauce.  That came about 10 minutes after the dishes were served and our dishes were 75% finished.  There was barely anybody in the restaurant aside from one family and one other couple."}
{"text":"Geez I love this place. They have an awesome vibe and a very accommodating staff everytime I am there. Not once have I felt like the service was poor and I have been quite a few times. I would recommend this to anyone who is ok with some noise and isn't worried about getting the cheapest food.  I want to hire whoever designed Earl's to design the interior of my home. I love it. It is beautiful in there. In addition, the people working there are pretty good to look at as well. I like the bar area and they have plenty of TVs if thats your thing.  Food, well the food is good. I haven't had anything I've not liked and I've not had anything I am absolutely crazy about but it is quite good. They have a good sized menu that changes pretty regularly so there are always some good things to try. In my last visit I had the fish tacos and they were quite good. Not great, but very good. The beer is also quite good and the selection is better. They also run specials from time to time which is nice however it still is a bit overpriced, even for Canada.  Despite the place always being crowded, I have never had a problem getting a seat at the bar. I am usually here on work travel and eating alone so camping out at the bar is generally my thing but I have sat at tables with people as well and never had an issue.  Earls sits right next to Moxies who I am sure is a direct competitor, but I would give the nod to Earls."}
{"text":"Earl's gives off a gastropub vibe, perhaps unintentionally. We came here in late May to celebrate Swati D.'s birthday and had an enjoyable experience overall. I got some time of chicken sandwich with roasted apples, which is kind of a genius idea, taste-wise. There was a bit of a mix-up with my dad's pasta which he chose because he thought it was fully vegetarian but the description didn't mention that it came with chicken. A few minutes of confusion ensued, followed by a replacement of my dad's meal, sans the offending chicken. We also got the spinach dip as an appetizer and while it was delicious, I feel like it's hard to go wrong with a dish so deeply entrenched in cheesy goodness. Swati D.'s fish and chips were well portioned and crisp but seemed too greasy for my taste. Overall, I'd say it's a nice place to have a bougie-chic kind of meal. The bill for the 4 of us, with 4 entrees, 1 app, and 2 drinks came to a little over $220 which is steep but again, see note regarding \"bougie-chic\". All in all, Earl's is elevated pub food, located in a mall, in a suburb of Toronto so you can bet that it's more likely than not to be featured on a Food Network TV show."}
{"text":"Took a client here with a colleague for lunch and ordered the mediterranean linguini with chicken.  It was pretty tasty and the linguini was al dente.  Side of crusty bread was a perfect compliment. I can't comment on what my companions had but I'm sure it was tasty.  All the plates were polished clean!   Patio reminded me of O&B on Yonge and Front.  Wish I could've stayed and had a few more pints but had to run to another appointment.   3 entrees, 2 pints of beer and a glass of wine; $100 including tip."}
{"text":"Lunch on Saturday.  Excellent spicy black bean soup served with very dry focaccia bread. Worst fettuccine Alfredo ever.  Sauce was minimal and what was present was thin and tasteless.  We mentioned it and were given more of the same in a small dish.  Will not return anytime soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant has no appeal. It is highly overrated and gives off a pretentious vibe.   My boyfriend and I visited Earl's on a Friday evening, we were waiting to get seated at the front and another couple came after us. A hostess served them immediately and ignored us. We had to wait for the next hostess to serve us. We sat on the high tops in the lounge.   Menu was not very appealing and price was higher than average especially for the quality of food. As a result, we ordered the Avocado Toast and Sweet Potato Fries with a pitcher of beer.   The Avocado Toast was awful, the Avocado was not fresh at all and taste was disappointing. Sweet potato fries was meh, nothing impressive.   Overall, I would not come here again. My boyfriend and I both agree, there are better restaurants out there at a more affordable price and better quality in food and service. Not sure what the hype is all about with Earl's."}
{"text":"Earl's/Fuel on 8th has a lot of flash and not much else. It's thoroughly ok. The inside is uber-contemporary like all Earl's locations, but pales in comparison to some of the stellar downtown restaurants that it apes. For one, you could get a much better meal at those places for the same price. Yeah huh.   Fuel is the lounge side of Earl's, and the music is blasting so conversation can be difficult. The drink \"specials\" are basically a joke. I have never wanted to spend a night here.  On the restaurant side, the food is ok. It's decent, it can even be downright tasty. But it is fairly unimaginative and tends to come with a fairly hefty price tag (mid-range). The staff is usually helpful and present, and occasionally even friendly. But in my experience, they don't really leave you to linger and chat. Which is unfortunate as this Earl's is one of the only places in the core that is open past 6.   I just feel like I can do so much better."}
{"text":"Decent pub. Good TVs to watch any sports event. Good selection of beer, and the food is pretty good. Good safe place to eat."}
{"text":"Went to Earls on a Sunday morning. If you've been in the industry you know that's not a good play as most of the staff won't be feeling too great anyway. Regardless, this is how it went.   First off, I should say we go to Earls three or four times per week; Earls in Westhills, not the one here on MacLeod.   We walked in the lounge and sat ourselves. We were one of three tables. We waited about 6-7 minutes without acknowledgment before deciding to sit on the patio where there were more servers present. From there it went downhill.   Our server Kelsey was very kind and treated us well. However it just wasn't a very good experience. In order this is what happened:  - the drink ordered was \"xxx\" out on the screen so we would have to wait until the manager fixed this. When asked to make the drink and wring it in after, she said she couldn't do that.     - two of our entree came out and the their came out missing the chicken. Reason was the chicken was \"poorly cooked\" and we would have to wait for it about 9 minutes to be redone. I understand that can happen, but it was strange they brought the sides to sit and get cold while waiting.   - we ordered a beezer which came out unprepped and tasting foul. The bartender hadn't made one before he said. Oops.   - while sitting there, we witnessed 2 other tables send back food. Unsure why, but it wasn't a good sign.   - I really enjoy Earls so please don't take this review as negative for the entire franchise. I just wouldn't strongly recommend going to a different Earls"}
{"text":"pretty not much else to say when you've got a hip atmosphere w/ hot chicks and other eye candy.  but have to say i'm impressed w/ their takeout cutlery.  plastic wrapped individually so one would have to tear off one end, so not resealable ;) guaranteed to be not touched  by any other hands.  the Chinook salmon's always my favourite and even the sticky toffee pudding to go, is still pretty yummy, with the caramel and chocolate sauces individually wrapped and the chocolate lava cake still warm by the time i got to hotel 10min later."}
{"text":"rating purely on the atmosphere and eye candy, much different from the Earls in vancouver.  guess it was the after work crowd, and it's quite lounge-y & club-like where ppl just hang there for drinks and standing, walking around.  Pretty cool patio, a huge one, too, right in the middle of towering skyrises all around.  Heat lamps throughout of course."}
{"text":"Very poor service. Hunan came out pretty much burnt, rather than offering to take it off the bill, they offered to make me a new one to take home \"for lunch tomorrow\". Not really a fan of eating something 2 days in a row. Seems with all our complaining over the last few months, at least they brought back the pan bread.  Update: When the bill came, the Hunan was no longer on there either. So good redemption on their part, now I need to figure out how to tip. You feel somewhat obligated to tip well due to the removal of the burnt food, yet the service wasn't great, which he apologized for. In the end I tipped on what the bill would've been."}
{"text":"I've been frequent Earls patron since the 90's and miss not having many out east till the first one opened downtown Toronto. Albino Rhino, bacon cheddar burger, steak sandwich ( not on The menu now), Shrimp pesto pizza.  Their basic menu hasn't changed much since day one without exception to some new add ons and seasonal additions. Today I had a bacon cheddar burger and the quality and consistency is the same as the first one I ate maybe 20 years ago!   A classic staple that never gets old unless you eat here too often!"}
{"text":"Single girls - this is The place to be on a friday evening!  Ratio is definitely in your favor in a good way."}
{"text":"Thanks so much for having Gluten Free options! The CHICKEN Santa Fe Salad is my absolute favourite and I love that you added a GF desert option... Coconut Cake. The waitress was super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I really have to say, the chopsticks are exceptional quality, I've never seen such good disposable chopsticks in Toronto. I like all the food I eat here except salads. My colleagues and I usually just get appetizers to share. Recommend here in summer time when patio season starts."}
{"text":"Decent meal. Brought my parents out for brunch. The clam chowder was delicious. My dad wasn't too impressed by their house burger. Service was good, our waitress was a peppy and upbeat gal. Very polite. Even obliged in taking a family pic for me."}
{"text":"Tonight, I went out with my boyfriend for a dinner and movie for the very first time in a very long time. We have never been at Earls before, so we decided to make a reservation and go!   We both ordered the \"New York California Cut\" 10oz steak. It came with garlic mashed potatoes and fresh veggies of the day (today they offered only green beans). For that meal alone, the price was $33 CND, which we felt wasn't too expensive.   Upon getting our meals, we realized how tiny the portions were. The 10oz steak was definitely less than 10oz for sure! We both eat steaks on a regular basis so we know what the approximate size should have been. The mashed potatoes were clearly sitting for some time and were served cold and somewhat stale. The green beans were barely cooked and were so hard.   Thankfully my steak was done the way I wanted it to, well done but not burnt. My boyfriend ordered medium rare but instead got a very bloody steak, which I should mention was also cold. We decided not to both with getting his meal swapped out because we had a time limit before our movie but we told our serve about it. She did not seem sympathetic what so ever. She only came to check up on us the minute we got our meals from another server (before we had the chance to take our first bites) and at the end when we waved her down for the bill.   The dress code that the waitresses had is a totally different story. I honestly felt like I was at a Hooters. My boyfriend and I felt very uncomfortable because we saw at least 5 girls' boobs. Their cleavage was too revealing. I mean there are families with young children, please dress accordingly. Our server for example wore a black see through shirt with a black bra under. At the very least wear a tank top... I really didn't need to see all those boobs today.   Over all, I didn't really enjoy my time at Earls. The staff's dress code was inappropriate and made me feel uncomfortable, the meal portions were too small, and we left feeling disappointed and still hungry.  For 2 steaks, a sprite and a Stella beer, our bill came up to just $100.00 without the tip. That's awful. Unless Earls makes some changes, we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Bas√© dans un centre commercial, je ne m'attendais pas √† grand chose en allant diner ici. Mais Earls propose un espace lounge ambiance tamis√©e avec chemin√©e et un coin plus \"grande table\" pr√®s du bar plus conviviale peut-√™tre. Super d√©co.  La carte est assez vari√©e : des plats traditionnels canadiens, quelques plats √† tendance indienne et des incontournables (comme la salade c√©sar, le burger, etc.)  Ma salade du jour √©tait hyper bonne. Je n'ai rien √† redire.  J'ai pris un coca, √† peine √©tait-il fini qu'on m'en a apport√© un 2√®me qui n'est pas factur√© : boisson illimit√©e ?  Bref je recommande !"}
{"text":"I just had lunch here today, and maybe my expectations are not very high, but I was BLOWN away by the lunch service.   Arrived at 11:50AM with no reservation to meet a friend - the place was beyond buzzing, apparently Thursday is a very busy day. They put me on the wait list and said it would 15 minutes, and they would text me. They have a nice wait area, couches etc, so I just spent time on my phone until my friend came. In about 15 minutes, I did get a text saying my table was ready - love technology! We got a high table by the windows and it was just a lovely spot to be. Sunny, far enough away from the other tables.   I ordered the Cajun chicken ciabatta sandwich with fries - the Cajun chicken actually has a kick, and the bread is soft and has some greens and tomatoes. The fries were crunchy and I shared with my friend, and still left some in the container - definitely worth the $13.75. My friend got tuna tacos with a small salad. She really enjoyed both dishes, again perfect lunch serving and affordable pricing.   The waitress was really friendly, kept checking in on us and we got water promptly, our food arrived in about 10 minutes (which is great as its lunch hour) and the tab came swiftly once we were done. The main Hostess also came by and said that she is glad we stuck around for the table, and to find out if everything was going well.   In and out in one hour and we didn't feel rushed. All in all, I will be returning after work to have their cocktail specials and enjoy the patio as the weather warms up."}
{"text":"I was fiending for some late-weeknight sushi, and every sushi joint in town was already closed. The wonderful hostess at Spoon & Fork (which was closing up across the street) recommended we hit up Earls for its mango dynamite roll. Bless that lady's soul, and Earls' late closure. The sushi appetizer was BRILLIANT. Seriously. 10/5 stars for that roll... So flavourful. My date and I also shared some sweet potato fries which were dece.  For an entr√©e, we split the chicken and mushroom fettuccine... Sounds like a delicious dish that would be hard to f--k up, right? Oh Earls, you manage to achieve the impossible. It was horribly bland and unsaucy. Not cool, man.  Service was bland and nothing special... Our server took quite long to approach us initially and forgot to bring us something.  Overall, twas a decent dining experience. The decor is cool. Whenever I come back for that bomb dot com sushi, I'll be sticking to appetizers, because entr√©es at Earls always seem to be painfully mediocre."}
{"text":"The menu is great and the atmosphere is nice too. The servers are all great. The only thing I don't like about Earl's is that when you are seated on the Lounge side, you have to physically walk past the server station, and all the servers standing there, to get to the washrooms. It's a bit awkward and poor planning on the part of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I would typically give Earl's a 4 star experience but this one just didn't get that extra star. We went there on a Saturday night for a late dinner around 9pm and was seated easily for the 11 of us. Our server was overall great and attentive but our food came out awfully slow for how very few people were in the restaurant that night. (it was pretty much -30 with wind chill)   I ordered the hot wings to start. Very tasty and served fresh from the fryer! My main was the tuni sushi salad and although the flavors were on point the rice was way too hard. I don't know if they were trying to go for uncooked-hard texture kind of crunch or more of a soft rice with crunchy lettuce. Either way the rice was VERY undercooked or perhaps old and super dry. It didn't work for me and I found myself spitting out pieces of hard rice in between bites. Not pleasant  Other than that, service could have been a tad faster. But I will mention our server did well at keeping our bills separate - I love when they do this automatically...but obviously only if it's done right and she did a good job!"}
{"text":"I had an errand to do in the Financial District a couple of weeks ago and I passed by Earl's. Everyone in the joint seemed to be having a jolly good old time on the patio, so I decided that I would come back to see what all the hype was about.   Came here tonight for a Saturday night dinner.   My friend called about reservations on Monday and was told that they were completely booked. Hardly the case. We walked in and waited for 20 minutes to sit in the dining room. The waiting period gave us an opportunity to look around the entire restaurant.   Decor of the place is really nice. The lounge area is an open concept w huge screens to watch sports (I guess?). The patio is spacious with heaters so you don't freeze your derriere while sitting there. In spite of the consistent theme of open and spacious going on here, the dining room was a little crowded and tight to maneuver.   The Food: Grilled Chicken and Brie Sandwich w French Fries  Love the idea. Grilled chicken, brie, apple slices, garlic mayo, spinach and fig jam sandwiched in between a ciabatta bun. Good idea and potential to be a kick a$$ meal. Sadly, it was way too oily. I had to keep wiping my hands as oil kept dripping on to my plate.   Service was ok. Initial contact w the server took a long time. I have to give kudos to the manager. She noticed this and got us drinks on the house.   Nice place with mediocre, reasonably priced food in a swanky neighborhood.   A solid 3 star."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my lunch at Earl's with my girlfriends. The staff is very friendly. All the food was great and the ambiance is excellent. We had mostly appies and they were all tasty and made well. The only downside was that our server wasn't experienced in alcohol service so her drink suggestions were not very good. I also wish that the Calgary Earls offered the same menu items as in Toronto, namely beef carpaccio."}
{"text":"My friend stayed at the Sheraton Toronto Centre for a work conference.  I stupidly suggested we grab dinner at Real Sports without checking first to see if there was a major event.    Turns out, when the Maple Leafs are playing a home playoff game, Real Sports is a shit-show no-go.  On our way back to the hotel, we stumbled upon Earl's.  The outdoor patio looked great, but was first come first serve and sadly full.  I got a burger and yam fries (same as sweet potato) and my friend got a pizza.  We split the spinach artichoke dip.  For the type of food, it was well executed and reasonably priced.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Had lunch here recently. I've always heard good things about this place and it definitely didn't disappoint.  I enjoyed an 8oz steak with peppercorn sauce. I found the dish very tasty. Service and atmosphere were great. I look forward to coming back in the summer as I heard they have a great patio for drinks"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times for casual drinks and catchup sessions.  Service was good here, our waitress was very attentive and friendly, came around a bit too often though haha.  FOOD: Truffle fries for app.. so delicious!  Usually I don't like fries too soft, but these thin truffle fries stole my heart with a simple salt and pepper blend.  For the main, I had the slow braised rack of BBQ back ribs - sweet and spicy BBQ sauce, warm potato salad + coleslaw.  Sorry Earl's, your BBQ sauce was a bit too sweet and not at all spicy.  Hmm.. left me wanting more to this dish.  Key lime pie - en pointe!!! I was too full after app and main to fully enjoy it but I know a good key lime pie when I have one :P    Can't give it a four-star since it's franchisey with nothing special for me to comment on, but definitely makes a good spot for a fun night out with friends :)"}
{"text":"Very poor experience at this Earl's location.  The waitstaff and hostess were completely clueless to nearly every single question we had (we were asking about happy hour specials), their menus are outdated such that the waitress had to explicitly mention that it was not valid, and the food experience was very poor.  I ordered the fish tacos, which were served to me with the fish raw. THE FISH WAS RAW - it was a white fish and was still completely translucent and lukewarm.   The dry ribs were, unfortunately bone dry with no flavour but salt.   To make matters worse, they didn't even apologize for the raw fish beyond, oh, I'm sorry. They didn't comp the tacos. Are you serious?   The staff were no where to be found and it was hard to flag someone down. What a disaster of a restaurant. Absolutely terrible experience."}
{"text":"Excellent service and wonderful and knowledgeable  Manager named Michael who was involved in ensuring that we got great service.The food was high quality and we appreciated that when he was late serving a drink that was ordered, he comped it (it was a crazy, busy night)... Lively and engaging atmosphere. We are definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Earls, is well, Earls. Yes its a chain but definitely much better than most. Always get great service here, and have my favorites such as the curry, blackened chicken with fettuccini and the hunan kung pao. They make a fantastic house caesar also!"}
{"text":"I recall working at Earls when I was a teenager, now this is a full two decades ago folks so I am quite surprised I am including this establishment as one of my yelping reviews. And I know...I know there are many Earl's Restaurants in Calgary but I especially like the one on 4th Street SW.  I don't know exactly what it is about it but I am drawn feverishly to the interior design choices, the glorious lamps, the very nice colour palette and very comfy seating areas.  The staff is especially friendly and may I add good looking plus the service and food presentation is always excellent.  I have even had a nice brunch with friends outside on the patio where the fireplace was lit to give an incredibly homey feel.  I have taken my aunt, my cousin, my friends, my business associates and even my mother here, who all vary in age, background and taste but each person always leaves feeling thoroughly satisfied on all levels at this Earl's.  But my most impressive challenge for this conglomerate was one night while working on a project summary in the bar area?  I was craving a mint milkshake and even though they didn't have it on the menu the bartender made me one of the most wicked concoctions I have ever had.  Twenty years later I am still a fan."}
{"text":"Had brunch here yesterday, overall everything was fine, but certainly not amazing. No big issues but a few things that could've been improved.  I had a two egg breakfast and although it was good I found almost everything on the plate really salty (eggs, grilled bread, potatoes). My boyfriend tried the chorizo mushroom hash, he also found it salty and said there was too much hollandaise. Service was friendly although it took us awhile to get ketchup when requested and also to receive the bill.   In the past I've really loved Earls for dinner (have been in other cities but never to this location) so will probably come back and try it in the evening sometime - but I won't go out of my way to return for brunch."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Although this is a chain, it does not behave like one. It reminds me very much of Joey's. I am relieved to see places like this opening up instead of more Milestones and Moxie's, and in the absence of a Cheesecake Factory this is a great option. The food is delicious, and although there are traditional items, this is not a traditional menu. From the appetizers, to the entr√©es, and finally to the desserts, my three girlfriends and I had an amazing time. The ambiance is vibrant yet relaxing, the decor is super trendy yet classy, the service is fantastic, and just like at Joey's you have the option of sitting at the lounge with the bar and huge screens in a super comfy booth, or in the dining area.  This place is not small and it gets VERY busy because of how good they are."}
{"text":"Great food ! Great resteraunt but horrible service!! Come on!!! This was my first place of employment as a busser  and we rocked it! Now we have been taken over by the young that don't care  and managers that are unaware!! Sad...really! So many places to take our business!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and pretty good food. The menu is pretty diverse and it would hard to not be able to find something that you wouldn't enjoy."}
{"text":"Everything we had: mojito, appetizer, meals were amazing. I tried each of my friends meals too and they were delicious. Great atmosphere, awesome outdoor seating area, good service and reasonably priced! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here to catch up with some friends the other day.  I ordered the Italia pizza and a bottle of Corona (Monday special).  The food was well timed since all the dishes were served hot at the same time which is to be expected at a place like Earl's.  My pizza tasted great, tasted and looked like it was baked in a stone oven.  Earl's is always a nice area to lounge and talk to friends.  However, I knocked it down to 3 stars because I haven't been feeling too well since eating the pizza.  Waitress also didn't refill our water after we paid the bill (there were lots of tables open so we just sat and talked)."}
{"text":"No, no, no, no, no, etc.  This was a horrible experience for myself and one of my friends.   1. It started pouring rain and we were seated outside... ignored by the waitresses I had to huddle under an umbrella and try to eat my food standing.  2. I was given a blanket for seating outside that was already soaking wet. Gross.  3. We moved ourselves inside and continued to be ignored by staff.  4. I asked for a dessert menu..took them fifteen minutes to bring one even though the restaurant wasn't busy.  5. No idea who our server was supposed to be, we were told to just flag down anyone... That's just weird.  6. When we asked for the bill, it took them over twenty five minutes to bring it. We just ended up leaving cash on the table because we were so fed up.   As for the food...meh. I ordered the \"Earl's World Famous Clam Chowder\", Earl's must have gone through Alice's looking glass because in what world is this famous?! It tasted like it was from a can, bland and totally salty. The bread that it came with was stale and toasted. Ugh. This also cost me $8.00...for soup. I also got a margarita..in a rocks glass...that tasted like lime juice and ice.    I will never come back, this was a terrible experience from such an upscale place.   Nice chairs though."}
{"text":"I've been here probably about 6 times now since it opened. Since it's right next door to where I work, it's an easy place to go.  The outdoor patio opened this week, and it's GORGEOUS. Unfortunately, it's super hard to get a seat, or even standing room on the patio. I've tried about 4 times now and I haven't succeeded yet.  The drinks and food are consistently good, though it's a bit slow since it's so busy. I like that they have drink specials almost everyday except for weekends (Fri - Sun), which makes this cheaper than some other places in the area. (E.g. On Thurs, all cocktails are $4.99 instead of $6.99).  If you can get a seat here, I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Earls is one of my favorite places to hang out in while in the area. The service is usually excellent and the best thing is this place is big enough to accommodate big groups even on the weekends. The Deserts are yummy but very rich. You might want to share the cakes with another person."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Earl's restaurant in 8th Avenue first because of their service which is usually excellent. The food quality is also usually really good, and I think it's worth the price you pay. During business hours, you need a reservation for lunch, or you should go just before 12 and be ready to wait a bit."}
{"text":"With Earl's you can usually expect a steady quality of service and you rarely get disappointed. the food is always good and the servers are professional."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from their fettuccini shrimp Alfredo. I'm sicker than a dog right now and now I may never eat shrimp fettuccini Alfredo ever again."}
{"text":"I am Earls fan but this was just an average meal. It was a Thursday March 1/18.  Here's the thing; I ordered the Cajun Chicken with \"warm\" potato salad & coleslaw. The chicken was beyond delicious as usual but the potato salad was cold. If it's featured as warm it should have been warm.   So to make it up the Restaurant Manager did the right thing she comped my dessert. She was was very polite, efficient & understanding. So if you want to keep good people (Earls) like this young Manager...look after her!"}
{"text":"I met business colleagues here for lunch....mistake. The place had lost most of its kitchen due to some sort of issue. As such they offered a very limited menu. I ordered fish tacos from the limited menu. They were good but not great. Small portions of fish on the tacos (this seems to be a common problem) but what was there was virtually tasteless.   The high point of the meal was the garlic fries (not a great thing to be good at)! I will say that our server went out of her way to provide quality service which she did quit well.   This is a 2* review due to the lack of menu choice. My past experience with Earls was most always good. I'd go again but only when the kitchen is working again!"}
{"text":"My last visit wasn't the best. This time they blew it outta the water. The Cajun Chicken with the warm potato salad was outrageously delicious. There was dill, there was bacon & there was mayo...what's not to love. The waiter & restaurant Manager were excellent. They were attentive & willing to serve. If you're listening Earls...these two guys deserve a raise!! Well done Earls!"}
{"text":"I don't mind the Earl's chain, the menu items always entice me and they are reasonably priced for what you get. I decided to have lunch here while working downtown as LOCAL was completely full. Surprisingly, we were greeted by two friendly hostesses and our server that afternoon was very friendly and attentive.  We ordered my favourite appie, the Dynamite Rolls, and they were delicious! No complaints there. I also went with the Tortilla Soup and the Chicken Caesar Salad, both were quite good and very generous portions. Based on the poor reviews, I was expecting a lackluster meal, but I was actually impressed and we were in and out within the hour. I may just give this Earl's another try next time I am dining DT."}
{"text":"My mom and I decided to do lunch on Friday and didn't want to venture too far from home. Since neither of us had been to Earl's in a while (and we flat out REFUSE to go to Joey's in Crowfoot, due to the horrible service), we headed over here and were seated on the patio in no time. The weather was gorgeous, but due to the location of our table vs. the sun it was a constant battle to be able to see properly. I adjusted the curtains on our cabana and it seemed to help, although when the wind picked up, it wasn't really working for us. Minus a few points for their seating arrangements, but we were enjoying the day nonetheless. We both ordered drinks (Raspberry Mojito's...yum!) and a selection of appies, including the Tempura Dynamite Rolls (super delicious as always), the Albacore Tuna Poke Nachos (a wonderful addition to their menu - but not quite as good as Craft's version!), and the Calamari (decent, not a fan of their tzatziki). Everything came out quickly without issue, and tasted delicious. Service was as expected, nothing extraordinary. All in all, it was a good dining experience for what we were looking for. As I've said before, I prefer to stay away from the chain restaurants, but I was thoroughly satisfied after our meal here."}
{"text":"I have recently been to Earls for the first time. My better half and I had a double date and elected to stop at Earls for late drinks.   First of all, I was very impressed at how nice and cozy their outdoor patio was. Intimate sitting and lighting, a great view of the sky and heaters gallore to make sure we wouldn't freeze to death on that September evening.   Place was quite crowded for a Thursday evening but we still were able to get a table and be served fast. They had great $6 deals on Bellinis and Frozen Lemongrass Cosmo. The latter now being my best friend. Refreshing and innovative taste.   Our waitress was always present for us and was very pleasant, taking time to talk and making jokes with us."}
{"text":"The Quinoa and Avocado Powerbowl was perfect for me, as a Whole Foods, Plant-Based follower.  It was vegan, and delicious.  My husband had the roasted salmon, and he was happy.  The staff was charmingly accommodating, and the wine selection was excellent.  I only wish Earl's was a little closer to my home."}
{"text":"The main reason this is a 5/5 this visit is because of our server Diana. The service from Diana was what I had expected. As I asked and as she explained, She was handling a bigger party on the top deck of the dining room. But was later transferred to the bottom deck. She was not sure if we had been helped, I had made eye contact and within the next 2 minutes she was with us, great attitude and taking our order. She had our water filled when needed and checked on us twice during our meal just to make sure everything was okay. Bravo to the cooks who had prepared my Oven Roasted Salmon! The salmon was beautifully season and moist. The vegetables were delicious and thank god for the rice that it was not wild rice, it was well cooked and seasoned as well. The wife got the Blackened Chicken, once again beautifully seasoned and moist. More than half way through the chicken, the seasoning because a bit too concentrated but we suppose that's the way the rub is supposed to be. Once again, glad that Diana was our server and we will definitely be coming again and we'd like her to over see our visit."}
{"text":"What's with the one stars here! Well Earls is Earls. Chain restaurant and I have been to so many Earls. To me they are pretty much the same and have that standard expectation (after going to so many). Came here for lunch. Service was ok.   I came in here on Friday at 11am (right just after they opened.) We did have to somewhat kind of find a hostess and let her know we are here. Also because we entered in through the Banker Hall mall entrance, we didn't get service until we hunted someone down. Maybe we came too early. Server didn't come check up on us frequently so there were times when my drink was finish and I didn't get a refill. So I ordered the Baja Fish Taco with fries. Food was good and very standard. Only issue was it did take a while for it to come. Maybe because we were the first customer and they had to heat up the stove (maybe?). the fish was nicely battered  and not soggy. This is a good thing.   D√©cor was nice and clean. I sat on one of those booth seats.   Overall, it was ok."}
{"text":"It seems they increased the price of the dishes. Food are good as usual. But the waitress brought dirty plate and mug with coffee stain."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday on a Friday night, and had a great experience. The frozen Pink Lemonade cocktail was delicious & the garlic fries so amazing. I also tried the chicken tacos which were pretty good.  The service & price were also great."}
{"text":"Great selection of drinks; I tried the frozen Pink lemonade and the raspberry mojito.  As always the famous garlic fries were delicious, but the Parmesan sauce was pretty thin, so j think i'll request the garlic aoli next time   For dinner I tried the Quinoa Avocado Power Bowl with Cajun Chicken and it was delicious.  Really filling and you don't feel extremely bloated like you would after eating a burger.   The patio is also great!"}
{"text":"Great spot. Literally everything here is good with the exception of the Caesar salad. Would never think it but the wings are among the very best I've had and I've had them all. For what I like anyway. Small and very hot. Nice atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Like all earls I find basically everything on the menu great. Great patio set up at this location and always very busy being in finance district."}
{"text":"I was interested in trying this joint, but it was such a bad experience I can't even comment on the food. Upon arrival we were not acknowledged by the two hostesses because they were too busy gossiping about the customers. I asked if we could be seated and she told us to seat ourselves and she'd be over with a menu. No one came within 10 minutes... finally she sat 2 other parties with full menus and still didn't bring us a damn thing. We got up and left."}
{"text":"I think Earl's was erected for the noble man who refuses to go to Hooter's not because he doesn't like the sight of women putting themselves on display but because he likes to tell women that he doesn't go to Hooter's.    Earl's in other words, is a high class Hooters.  The waitresses dress skimpily, lean over their tables in that oh so right way, and serve above par burgers and wings.  Being of the female orientation I still think Earls is a fun place to go, despite having to grit my teeth when the blond bomb shell grins her Crest whitened teeth at me, shoves her boobs in my face and asks me if I would like the awesome drink special.    There are a variety of choices on the menu, but my tip is to stick to the middle of the road food, burgers, sandwiches, apps (the wings and the dry ribs are excellent) etc. don't stray into the ethnic categories leave that to a restaurant that doesn't hire staff based on breast size."}
{"text":"Very nice place, great for lunch! Upscale interior design, good selection of wine and foods. Service was outstanding! Went there to celebrate a small personal event, and a waitress brought us glasses of celebratory champagne on the house- very sweet gesture!  It was a little too loud, making it hard to have a proper conversation. We went there for lunch, so it was very busy, seemed like the whole financial district prefers lunches at Earls.  Salsa shrimp appetizer was pretty good, zesty and full of flavor,  Unfortunately steak was only OK. (3/4). It seemed like it was slightly overcooked and not very flavourful. Ended up being very disappointed. It is a little on the expensive side, but the food is not up to the standards."}
{"text":"Parking: Free (if you ride a motorcycle, there's a spot literally across from the venue). Otherwise look for underground Green P parking $8 Flat rate.   Venue: Really big, I mean REALLY BIG. You could get lost in the place, there's an outdoor patio too.  Washrooms: Very small, (for the Men's experience). 3 Urinals, 1 stall, 2 sinks. Considering how big the venue is, you may find yourself waiting in line to use the bathroom. Not sure if there were other washrooms in the restaurant.  Experience: The waitress messed up by giving away our second booth to another group, so we were moved to a slightly bigger booth. Then we were shuffled around again to a bigger table (which worked out for the best. Since the large dining table fared better than 2 separate booths for our party size).  The waitresses were all tattooed up, which is my kind of waitresses since I'm a biker. The cutlery didn't have a nice shine to them, so I requested using disposable wooden chopsticks.  Everyone at this venue seemed to show up dressed really well in suits, you would swear there was some sort of dress code to get into this place but that's not the case you can show up casual. Our group said they felt under-dressed for the place.   We had dinner there and I ordered their 'Roasted Mushroom Bolognese', and it was good. The 'Cajun chicken' was a popular pick at our table. The price for your dish is something you would pay at a Jack Astor's/Milestones/Montana's/Kelsey's. So it's within reasonable price range and not ridiculously over-priced like a high-end restaurant, even though the place looks like one."}
{"text":"I used to frequent Earls for a post-work drink but for some reason I took a break from this place since Cactus and other restaurants opened up nearby. I came here actually during the weekday night and weekend within the past few weeks and forgot why I stopped coming here in the first place!  Both times, servers were great. Sat in the lounge/bar side to the left. Love their drink specials as well. One night was actually to celebrate a birthday and the manager kindly let us drop off the cake at their restaurant a few hours before we arrived to surprise our friend. Super nice.   For food - I had the Earls Clam Chowder. It was SO GOOD!!! Lots of clams in the soup. Definitely a fave in the group. The large size for $11 is actually huge compared to the cup for $8. Their field greens salad seems basic but I really enjoyed that as well. I've also tried the chicken and wonton app which deserves an honorable mention. Will definitely be showing up here more often after work :)"}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice recently for lunch ..It is just up the street from the office. I got a burger and truffle fries the first time, chicken/fig/apple sandwich with sweet potato fries the second.. Delicious! The sweet potato fries here are amazing crispy, light and soft... Served with Chipotle mayo.. The best!   The service here is great and very professional."}
{"text":"This place is always very lively everytime I walk pass by after 5pm, regardless of whether it's summer or winter time. We went in during a Friday afternoon for a quick round of drinks, which also happen to be the day where there's 2 dollar off signature cocktail (every Friday). Instead of getting different cocktails we got a pitcher of lime mojito (menu gives it a pretty name - big spoon 4 servings). Although the menu said one serving each has one ounce of alcohol, it's very light, almost like drinking lime juice. Not going to order this if we come back again.  We also ordered four shots of fruit hoops, which is bright red in colour and very sweet, just the way I like my alcohol!   Unlike usual bars, there are long benches and long tables, where people just bring in their laptop and work."}
{"text":"So I wanted to stop in for a quick beer and a burger.  Earls is well known for their burgers - I figured I would be good hands here.  So I ordered the Rascal Pale Ale and it came out flat with a head that would be more at home on top of a coke float than on beer.  I asked the waitress what what's up with their beer.  The head quickly disappeared and I was left with scum on the side of the glass.  The bartender came out and promised to pour another one using a glass that was not coming out of the freezer and making sure it was wet with water in the inside.  The second beer was not any better and equally flat .  I asked what the low side pressure was on the keg and never saw the bartender again.  The waitress swapped my beer again and the third was consistent with the others.  The burger and fries were fairly decent.  The waitress never asked how I wanted my burger and it came out well done.  After the beer fiasco I was not going to call this out."}
{"text":"So I am going to write this review from the perspective of someone who is a bit critical about the draught beer that I am served.  My wife calls me a beer snob.  I prefer to think of it as being an enthusiast and I have sampled hundreds of beers, done 35 plus micro brewery tours, dabbled in home brew and done a lot of reading to figure out modern draught beer systems.  I have also spoke with the general manager of this Earl's location multiple times about issues with their draught beer based on prior visits.  So last night I again was served flat Rhino beers at this restaurant (both the lager and the ale).  I do not understand why I was served these beers.  Any half competent bartender should be able to spot such issues by simply looking for the right kind of bubbles along the inside of the beer glass after pouring said beer.  In fact, the first pair of beers I was served, the bartender neglected to even rinse the glasses with fresh water so the beer would not stick to the glass.  And on the second attempt, they attempted to serve me beers that were poured into glasses that were rinsed but were still flat.  The lager should have had a lot more carbonation than the ale but both were equally flat.  So Earls is a restaurant that has gone to great lengths to have unique beer offerings - they have contracted with an excellent brewery in BC to brew two signature beers (the ones I ordered) and they also have a quality rotating tap from this brewery.  They have also installed a special tool at the bar to make spraying the glasses an easy task.  The general manager claims they have a contractor come in and clean the draught lines every few weeks and adjust the carbonation levels.  So why do they not have a bartender or manager sample a few ounces of beer every day to make sure things are perfect so customers can have the quality beer experience they are seeking and paying for?"}
{"text":"So the first time I at at a restaurant is this building, it was called Fuller's Fish and Chips.  In the early 80s, it was re-branded and became the second Earls to open.  I had not been to this location for about ten years, so it was nice to see that they have kept it current and the interior is nice.  Parking was more of a challenge then I recall in prior visits, but that is true for parking perhaps anywhere in Calgary in the last decade.  My elderly mother and I went to this restaurant without having made a reservation.  We got lucky and were seated right away and then asked to be moved to a table that did not rock when you touched it.  (Yup, a pet peeve).  We ordered some classic meals off of the menu - my mom had the chicken Caesar salad and I had a steak.  I quite liked that the steak price was not too expensive and they had a nice six ounce cut.  I seldom order steak because restaurants usually serve a 10 ounce or larger steak as the smallest offering.  I also like how they don't automatically serve you garlic bread and all of the side options that add a lot of extra calories to your dinner.  I do see that if you added a few options to your steak it would become a fairly expensive splurge in a hurry though.  The meals came out of the kitchen in a decent amount of time and were perfect when delivered.   We tried the pumpkin pie for desert - it was very well done!  The service was very good - little things like the water glass never got empty go a long way in my books."}
{"text":"We stopped for our first meal out in Calgary at the Earls tin place on 4th street and had a lovely time! It was around 2pm so the lunch rush had dissapated and we had a quiet and beautiful setting to enjoy with our 2 mates. Since its a Wednesday we scored 2 for 1 wings which were delish. They were crispy, a little spicy and came with a creamy dip. Great start. For lunch we ordered: Bibimap with tofu, bacon and cheese burger, soup (clam chowder), salad (ceaser salad) and pan bread and a southern chicken salad. All the dishes were fantastic but the Bibimap stood out. While not traditional the rice was crispy, the sauce was spicy and the veggies were spot on. To top off a nice meal, our lovely waitress kept the waters full and was super friendly."}
{"text":"I'm pregnant and had a serious chocolate craving so I ordered the Sticky toffee bread pudding to go, amazing!! Texture tasted of a mix between a brownie and chocolate cake. Very rich. Huge portion. Delicious. Even came with a toffee bowl."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a complainer, but I ate here with a friend and she received chicken that was terribly undercooked. I don't mean a little pink, but practically raw. (Picture:http://imgur.com/O2VUh )  She had eaten most of it without noticing. The manager spoke to us. She said she had talked to the cook, and yes, there was a tiny bit on the outside that wasn't cooked as well as it should have been, but everything is fine. We were like, um, here's a picture. She continued to tell us how it's totally fine, how she promises she'll be okay, etc, because the germs were all killed by the heat, etc.   This was a person who either did not know what she is talking about, or else is shining us on.    I'm not sure what one should expect from the establishment at this point. The manager is giving us her card and saying 'Totally email me if you don't feel well after, or even if you do, just to let us know, and we will take care of you.' What does that mean?  \"Let us know how how you're feeling, it's important to us\",  Unless the Earls Helicopter is going to appear, lower its breadstick ladder and take us to Earls Hospital where Earl himself is going to give us Thai massages while we wait to see if my friend has salmonella, I'm not sure what \"we'll take care of you\" means, unless it is colorful sounds to make it so that we don't get all uppity about being served a chicken that still has feathers on it.   They took her chicken off the bill. They left the drinks and other things. I don't know what standard procedure is, but to be allowed the privilege of eating raw chicken free of charge kind of seems like a poor deal.  Also, the teenage hostesses in negligee creeped me out. But that is different."}
{"text":"Cool place, great vibe, good food, service is ok...Order - steak and frites , was not really medium rare (more well) , steak and sushi was great! However, I will still recommend to visit if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"I've experienced better at the downtown location.   Visited Earls last night with some coworkers for happy hour. I was actually really excited to be going back to Earls since my previous experience in Toronto was so positive. I ordered the a glass of the house red and the dynamite roll. I requested the shrimp not to be breaded which they accommodated without hesitation. It arrived and it was really yummy. The rice was a touch under-cooked with a tiny bit of crunch but I honestly didn't mind. The flavours took precedence over the rice so I was a happy camper. So why the 2 star?  My house wine arrived in a glass suggesting it was a 6oz. A girlfriend ordered the 9oz which arrived partially filled with a little bottle accompanying it, also filled. This suggested to me that mine was a 6oz and hers a 9oz. I ordered another glass, as did my girlfriend. Mine arrived again filled while hers arrived with the little bottle, again suggesting mine is 6 and hers is 9. When the bill came, I was dumbfounded to see $48 owing. Absolutely shocked. How on earth was my glass of wine $16 a piece? I clarified with the server who removed it from the bill but did insist that my glass was 9oz. First, a house red at Earls shouldn't be $12 for 6oz/$16 for 9oz. That's just ridiculous. The wine itself was delicious and actually a new fave but the price wasn't right, Bob. Second, the server should ask what the customer prefers in terms of sizing. I would think you shouldn't up your customer's booze order without their permission.  I will come back for food and drinks but I will always clarify my order."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! I can't wait to be back in Toronto so we can eat here again.  We tried it for an early dinner on our last night and I was so sad we couldn't eat there again.  I ended up ordering sushi for carry out a couple hours later!!  The only thing that we didn't like was the appetizer dip."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night for dinner and drinks with a friend. I ordered the Frozen lemonade for my drink and it was great.  For my meal I ordered tortilla soup which is my go to anywhere it's offered. The soup was good it was tastey and seemed fresh not like it had been sitting in the warmer for days. For my main I ordered the chicken tacos which were also great.   Don't be fooled it's not Mexican style tacos it's more like a fancy Tex-mex but it's definitely tasty if you go in expecting it to taste like tacos you'd find in Kensington Market you'll be disappointed.   Overall I'll say the price is fair for what you get about the same price range as a moxies or milestones. I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"This is a big time poser spot.  Its got a great location and friendly enough staff but a big chunk of their business comes from the downtown lunch crowd and their kitchen is nowhere near fast enough to keep up.  We waited 40 mins from the time we ordered to the time that the food arrived today.  For a 1 hr lunch, that's unacceptable."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised by this Earls.  In recent years, we've had a few marginal dining experiences at various Earls locations so we've been staying away but this location turned out to be great.  We stopped in there for lunch and the service and food were both excellent.  The building is beginning to feel a bit dated but we'd definitely be back."}
{"text":"Even though I reside in the US, my husband and I like to come to Mississauga to vacay every few years. It's nice and quite, very different from Jersey. I absolutely love Earl's. It is the home of my beloved Chicken and Brie sandwich. The combination of the fig jam, apples, brie, garlic mayo, chicken and spinach is awesome. We love the warm cole slaw also.   When we first touch down, we come here."}
{"text":"So far, no complaints on any visit we've made.  This past dining experience was very good as we had great food (again) AND a lovely, professional, highly efficient server.    My wife enjoyed one of the salads (not on the menu?) which was tasty with chicken, beets, pears, candied pecans, creamed goat cheese and shaved parmesan.  We shared an awesome Dynamite Roll and I was in a starters mood so I had the Chicken & Wontons with the Tuna Tosdadas and finished the meal off with the choc/vanilla gelato/toffee sauce and a cappuccino.  The food has always been great at Earl's but do find them a bit pricey.  We spent (with tip) $100.00 and no alcohol (just water) involved - so, yeah.  That's a little steep.  I did note that some of the other staff (surprisingly, especially the young guys) like to 'chat' a lot and stand around not doing much while our server was running around and taking care of all kinds of other stuff so I'm not surprised to read some of the negative comments on servers."}
{"text":"This place is the definition of hit or miss, but when it's a hit, it sometimes hits VERY nicely...unfortunately all the best meals I've had here are gone the next time I come in. It's neat to have an ever-changing menu, but when you change it so often...the quality suffers."}
{"text":"We used to come here often for work lunches and dinners so I have seen their evolution since they arrived from BC several years ago. I work at a male-dominated office so management and the team gradually reduced the number of times we go to Earls as the waitresses became less attractive and flaunting as they put it. The eye candies are still there but it is not the rule at Earls anymore and so with that differentiation gone the team has been experimenting elsewhere more often.  Anyway, we were there on a Friday night and I frankly still think the menu is quite standard. The issue is that I personally would not order anything 'Asian' or 'Chinese' or 'sushi'/'Japanese' or 'Indian' at a Canadian chain restaurant like Earls leaving me with limited options. Hamburgers are also out because I do not order items I can easily make at home either. The restaurant has a couple of steak options, burgers, taco and so forth. The drink menu is wide. So with salad and soup at hand I was happy. The quality and quantity are generally fine.  The place is busy, but not packed and the dark atmosphere is appreciated. With that said, Earls is not a romantic date spot for high-end food. The bar/restaurant is loud and almost hectic. The washroom is clean despite the busy nature of the place.  Often their customers have an attitude for whatever reason, but ignore them and Earls is fine. The waiters instead were again friendly and patient and had a personality. What I always find odd about Earls is the number of people they pack at the hostess stand at the entrance. There are always 5 people standing there. Finally,a  reservation is recommended, but in the last year has not been mandatory."}
{"text":"Nice location.  Went on Sunday for brunch. Food and drinks came out in adequate timing. Our server was super friendly and caring and appreciative.  Funny how they were playing a re run flames game from previous night. Then it took several servers to try and figure out how to change the channels to Sunday football.  Other than that. Great experience."}
{"text":"Luckily we had ordered and came in right before the rush. The food was alright. The steaks were very small but flavourful. Four stars are for our server. I can't remember her name but her service was phenomenal. Even though she was busy she was still very attentive and quick to get refills."}
{"text":"I love this place! The ambiance is perfect and the food is amazing. I came here on a Wednesday afternoon and the place was packed, but it was nothing to complain about. Everything about the restaurant decor and style I love."}
{"text":"I loved the venue! Would definitely consider coming here on a nice summer day to enjoy a drink on the patio.  The food was okay. I ordered the Cajun salmon with rice and veggies. The seasoning had good flavour but was VERY salty.   The service was slow, but was average. I would have expect more considering the pricing."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Earl's to have a few drinks and apps and catch up with each other. We got a table outside since the weather was nice and the umbrellas completely cover the area in shade.  We got a Frozen White Peach Bellini, Watermelon Pina Colada, Raspberry Margarita, and Strawberry Margarita. Out of these drinks, the Bellini was by far the best (if you don't mind a \"girly\" drink). But since it was a Sunday, their margaritas were only $5 which is really good.  Appetizer-wise, we got the truffle fries and nachos with chipotle chicken. They both tasted amazing but got cold really fast because I assume our server really took his time delivering the dishes to us... which leads me to the service. The servers are friendly but the service is so unbelievably slow. There weren't even a lot of people in the restaurant since it was a Sunday afternoon but everything took so long. We didn't mind too much because we were busy talking but otherwise, I would've been pretty annoyed. At the end, when we asked for the bill, it took around 15 minutes for our server to bring it to us; when we asked for the debit machine, it took another 10 minutes; when my friend needed change for her cash, it took another 15 minutes. We spent almost three hours there even though we only ordered drinks and appetizers so I can't imagine how long it would've taken if we had gotten mains too.    Overall, I recommend getting whatever their daily special is because the food and drinks are really good, but just be prepared for slow service."}
{"text":"We love love love this location! My hubby and I visit regularly after an exhausting day at work. Located on 130ave, it is definitely a busy area but parking is never an issue like some establishments. We usually go for a late night meal followed by a few drinks but this past Sunday we tried their brunch and we were very impressed. This is definitely our go to restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped in during happy hour bartender was courteous, but I did have to ask for food menus after asking about happy hour wines . They did have a great price on a 9oz French Red, although I would guess it was a bit acidic for most. I also had the coconut shrimp which were among the best I have ever had!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to this earls since they got their new patio glass covering but it's super cool and looks very modern. I have always like the insides of earls restaurants, it is very classy. I also tend to get pretty good service. The food I would consider average though. This specific time around I had there southwest veggie burger and it was a tad bland. It can be hard to get a vegetarian burger right, and they could still work on it a bit. Their garlic fries were good however."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the nicer restaurants inside Square One. The setting is very classy and clean, and the service is wonderfully spirited and caring of all their customers. I enjoyed the calamari as my appetizer--crisp and seasoned to perfection with flavourful cuts of cucumber and olives in the mix. For my main course i had the warm kale salad, which was mediocre. The chicken i had ordered with it was quite dry and overcooked, however, the rest of the salad  was up to par. I particularly would have liked more goat cheese and less cranberries so as to balance the sweet brown sugar dressing. Overall i could definitely see myself coming back here to try other things on their extravagant menu!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had supper one evening here again and tried the Bibimbap - a Hot stone Rice Bowl with assorted veggies, a softly poached egg on top and sesame chili sauce.  You can add extras such as prawns, beef or chicken to this to make it more filling.  Only add the sesame chili sauce sparingly if you don't like too spicy !  Hubby had a big burger meal with some crispy fries and it was an enjoyable supper...."}
{"text":"Came here with my Mama and my aunt for a bday lunch.  Patio was, as usual, outstanding.  By outstanding, I mean plenty of sun and or shade, sturdy tables, great ambience and of course stylish.   My steak was served just as I enjoy it - rare.  I \"rarely\" order steak, but when I do it better be darn delish.  And it was prepared to perfection.  My mom's fish and chips were great as well as the fish tacos that my aunt ordered.    This location can be rather 'full of life'  and so be prepared to talk with exuberance and a touch louder than usual.  So don't take a date here and expect to whisper sweet nothings into each others ears....  I've been dining at various Earl's for *gasp* 25 years and it's never let me down by way of food or service.   If you want a consistent resto that delivers quality food with upbeat service then this is the place to dine."}
{"text":"Outstanding service at this Earls. The table was a bit odd, it seemed too long and too far from one end to the other, width wise.   Food here is great, it's the second Earls I've ever visisted aside from the one in Vaughan. The food is consistent. I came here on a week day after work and the place is jam packed. There was some sort of venue near the end beside the washroom. It was a bit too loud for my like for a sit down restaurant to eat."}
{"text":"This is the first Earl's I've been to, and my favourite one. Love the atmosphere, the food, the drinks, and the people here.  It's somewhere between a bar, and a nice borderline high end restaurant (without the dollar signs). Servers here are polite and talkative. I fell in love with a mashed potato salad thing (think it was a side dish for one of the mains) and when I visited the downtown location, they did not have it. I'm usually not a potato fan but I finished every bit of it.  And the Earl's g&t...anywhere with a good g&t has my heart, and this place definitely does. You make your own g&t with the little bottle of tonic water they provide to you. Super neat."}
{"text":"Had the noodles with vegetables while watching the warriors game. Super friendly staff. Great noodles . a bit salty but delicious. They say that its a place for bankers and lawyers but I did not find it expensive. Nice place to grab a drink with your co-workers after work."}
{"text":"Finally! West-coast chic comes to Toronto! Love it!! And it was hopping busy, even though it's Monday evening.  I've been to the Earl's chain of restaurants in a few different cities out west - in Alberta and BC. I never knew they had locations in Ontario! Soooo excited! But they've been in Toronto for 3 years. What was I waiting for?! There's one in London Ontario, and they're hoping to expand into the USA. Go Earl's!  It's an upscale rib restaurant, with a huge seating area inside and out on the patio, with a clean and chic interior. There's an outdoor patio that was full already even though it's only May. This location is well situated to serve the financial district of Toronto. The food is gorgeous and so are the waitresses and waiter.  We ordered their special: a full rack of ribs for $25.00 so that we could take advantage of their $4 glasses of beer that go with it, and a burger with fries, at about $12.00. Both were delicious!   I would definitely go back.   Please bring Earl's to Ottawa!! Pretty please!!"}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper at Earls this evening.   We both ordered an Albino Rhino beer ... I had a lager and Gord had a pale ale.  Yum!  We shared an order of Grilled Garlic Bread.  It was different but good.  I ordered a Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich ... but without coleslaw and lettuce.  The sandwich was really good and I only had a few fries because I was full.  Gord ordered Chicken and Field Mushroom Fettuccini.  He said the only problem is that from now on he couldn't see himself ordering anything else ... it was one of the best pasta dishes he has ever had.  Hmmm ... I think he liked it!  Avril was our server and she took good care of us!"}
{"text":"I love Earls! Their menu isn't the biggest but have a good variety of dishes to choose from. The server I had for this locations was friendly knowledgeable and served us well. The restaurant was clean and the staff was organised and helpful. I had the Bronx Burger which was amazing. I usually take out one onion ring from the burger because it gets waaay to oily and greasy for my liking. My boyfriend had the full rack of ribs and he was comparing it to the Baton Rouge ribs and he said the ribs were just as good. The meat fell of the bone and the BBQ sauce was tasty."}
{"text":"A very, inattentive and unprofessional wait staff. A bunch of immature brats who are getting paid yet act like they are hanging out at a club. Dismal excuse for customer service. Terribly rude. I stood around waiting for one of them to deign to acknowledge my presence at the front desk waiting area for 10 minutes. No one was at the front desk. 4 waitresses turned their nose up at me as I waited to be seated. One finally rolled her eyes and pointed at the lounge. I went there and was ignored by the waitresses and bartenders for  20 minutes. Finally I left in utter disgust. This place is bush league hype. Worst place I have seen. Stay away !!!"}
{"text":"Zentral gelegen mit der M√∂glichkeit drau√üen zu essen. Die Steaks sind klasse. Im Gegensatz zu Earls am Whistler wurden wir hier st√§ndig von der Bedienung angequatsch. Das hat etwas genervt. Die Musikbeschallung verfolgt einen auch bis in den Restrom.  Fazit: Gutes Essen zu fairen Preisen. Der Refil f√ºr Softdrinks ist kostenlos."}
{"text":"I was here for a birthday dinner and had a great time. The location was convenient and only a short walk from the subway station. The interiors and patio were nicely done and classy.  Our waitress was incredibly gracious even though we showed up late and took a long time to order. I went for the Saturday special and got a $7 raspberry mojito. It wasn't the best I've had but decent enough.  For entrees, I ordered the Bronx burger with truffle fries. The fries were the best part while the burger was average. I tasted some of my friend's chicken, brie and fig sandwich and if I ever do return, that's definitely what I'm ordering.  For such a large party, our meals came in a relatively short amount of time and service remained excellent throughout the night even though we totally overstayed our welcome."}
{"text":"The big problem with this place is the service.Its non existent. We cleared our own table as the hostess didn't even seat us-just pointed to the bar section and told us to find our own table. Every table that did not have people sitting at it was dirty, and there were not many people in there. We picked one with dirty glasses on it and we took the  glasses and placed them on the bar,resulting in a filthy look from the bar tender, who was texting on his phone. We then sat for 10 minutes and were on the verge of leaving when a server came with menus. We placed our orders- 3 salads and a soup, and some drinks. A different server brought the drinks. Another different server brought the salads- sans cutlery,but not the soup. Soup came. No cutlery. Finally got forks and spoons. I ordered the Santa Fe salad. It was very good, but at this point we felt we had definitely chosen the wrong place. Original server came when we were almost finished eating. My husband ordered a second draft beer-she did not ask if anyone else wanted another drink. Had to wait for the bill, wait to pay it.  It like the hipster staff feel they are too good to actually serve people. I don't recommend this place,unless you enjoy being frustrated !!!"}
{"text":"If Applebee's had a little better food, a younger crowd, and a more vibrant bar scene, it would be Earl's.  Earl's is your quintessential party-after-work spot with some good food, solid beer list, and a fun vibe as people wrap up their meals.  Especially on Thursdays and Fridays, it can get a little fratty but it's still a fun time.  I was traveling to Toronto for work, so I grabbed a seat at the bar and the bartenders were friendly to my lonely, sad self.  Food: 4/5 Value: 4/5 Service: 4/5 Atmosphere: 4/5"}
{"text":"Earl's is always packed - at least the Downtown location. The one on Barlow Trail was much more friendly for a drop-in without previous booking.  Nevertheless, getting in means that you will get a decent food, good drinks and stylish atmosphere to enjoy the evening. Service was usually good, quick and efficient. I would not take a word of their waiters to choose the wine, though.  Girls, if you'll get to Earl's with your fiancee, be prepared for him to constantly be distracted by the legs of the female servers. They are all dressing quite... khm... provocatively? - which may spoil the evening. Look for a table with male server instead. ;-)  Important detail - this place is pricey. Not outrageously, but clearly above the actual quality and abundance of the food. If you can expense that, great. If you are paying out of your pocket - this may hurt, just be prepared."}
{"text":"2 for food, 4 for decor.   Was not that impressed with the food at Earls. I ordered the Pecan Chicken Rocket Salad, which has  citrus dressed arugula, beets, pears, goat cheese coulis, spiced pecans, parmesan chips, pecan and porcini crusted chicken. The goat cheese tasted so good. But honestly, the salad was a bit small for $17.25. There was also very little pecans in the salad. It was probably like a few small TINY pieces at most. Small amount of arugula as well. The chicken was a bit dry. You know you're still hungry when you're thinking of going to Mcd for a snack after dinner at Earls. The salad was good but the value wasn't there. Also got to have some of the calamari and that was disappointing as well. It could be more crunchy. It did come super fast and that was the only good thing.   I won't be coming back again."}
{"text":"Stopped in there for dinner recently. Although the staff were busy as they had been slammed at an unusual time, they were friendly and worked to support each other. I had the santa Fe chicken salad with dressing on the side and it was delicious. The person I was with had the half rack of ribs and though it was delicious as well. Good atmosphere and clean.  One thing to note that I was not aware of, Earls prices are different depending on location. The NW location was cheaper. Tin Palace in the Mission area has higher prices for quite a few of their items than the one on 16thave NW as well as any other non downtown locations I suspect. For example, a steak at the 16ave location is only 24$ for the 7 oz , vs. the tin palace location which is 27$. Same with some of their happy hour prices on drinks."}
{"text":"The food and service here is the best in the area. I recommend the salmon or kale salad. Earls has the best menu with a variety of options. An easy choice on any day."}
{"text":"Came here for my fianc√©s birthday. There was about 6 of us. This place is great for groups and particularly for groups of 6. It has a great ambience and even on a Friday although busy it was not too loud. The menu has something for everyone. Between us we had the burgers, the salmon, the ribs and the bimbomp. Everyone was very happy with what we had. Our server was also very nice and friendly.   I particularly recommend the bimbomp or ribs."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice and laid back. Drinks were good. Too bad the bar staff has no clue what their prices are. High balls between 3-6 pm are supposed to be $3 (according to their website). I was charged $5.  When I questioned, was told they were in fact $5. It's the little things that make the difference between a good bar and a great bar. Probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Earls is Earls. I'm sure every single Canadian has been to Earls at least once in their lifetime. It is your classic chain restaurant, a few options 'diverse' options like sushi and chicken curry, and North American faves like burgers and steak with mashed potatoes.  I am writing this review because I really enjoyed some of the vegetarian options. I really love the spinach dip-- so much so, that it is my comfort food. I can eat it at any time of the day and no bread or ounce of dip is wasted.   The forager burger is absolutely delicious! I'm new to veggie burgers but out of the few I have had, I found this one exceptionally yummy. It's quite large too. I had to cut mine in half, and I ate the rest for dinner (I didn't reheat it, and it was still good cold.)  The staff was really friendly and made recommendations on what was popular on the menu. The atmosphere is a bit stuffy, you can tell this is the spot for lunch meeting for the professionals in the area.   Parking is atrocious. In fact, there are only about five stalls for Earls' patrons. It took me over 15 minutes to find parking, (I parked in Arby's customer parking, and prayed that I wouldn't get a ticket.)"}
{"text":"With so many different dining options in Square One, the question is, why stop at Earls? The answer: if you don't want to leave the mall but still want something fancier than Moxies. The food isn't bad; you'll find the standard offerings of burgers, pasta, and steak. It's also competitively priced at around $17 for the burgers, $22 for the pasta, and high $20s / low $30s for the steak.   My experience was muted, having the Bacon Cheddar Burger with garlic fries. Overall, it was a pretty average burger. There were a lot of toppings, but there wasn't anything special with it, from the meat to the toppings. The garlic fries were very crunchy, but it kind of tasted like regular crunchy fries as opposed to garlic fries. My dad had the prawn + scallop linguine, but it was lacking in both seafood and sauce. Not a bad pasta, but not great.   Overall, this was a very average experience. We spent $55 for two (I got a $6 Kombucha) and while not super pricey given the environment, it wasn't a value deal either. This is a place where if offered to go again, I would shrug and let the rest of the group decide..."}
{"text":"Chicken Brie and fig sandwich was amazing and the cheese royale did not disappoint   The food was fresh and fast and the atmosphere was stylish. The ladies room is so pretty"}
{"text":"Earls is a great place for food and drinks. But you need to replace your hostess. Just rude and terrible service. She has no idea what she's doing, and it makes me not want to come here because yes, the one with the nose ring is a delinquent.   Otherwise love coming here!!!!"}
{"text":"Extreme bad service.  5 of us went on a Sunday afternoon.  The service went from bad to worse.  We had a drink and were waiting for the server to come back to order refills 10 minutes later she appeared.  One of the orders was beer.  15 minutes later she appeared to inform us that the keg needed to be replaced.  We got our food and had no utensils and no server.  The manager was too busy leaning over the counter to pay any attention to our problems  We asked another server and all she said was I'll find yours.  Helpful...still didn't see her.  Sorry can't recommend this place."}
{"text":"VIBE  It would have been nice to experience Earl's had I actually gotten a seat here.  Given it's smack dab in front of the financial district and across from St. Andrew subway station (making it very accessible for those coming from elsewhere), it's not surprise we didn't get a seat here.   The patio is darling and due to the almost one hour wait, I can see why. But I don't wait in line for that long to stand outside. Um...   Inside, it's bankers and suits and more bankers and maybe a cougar and basketball player or two but...meh. If I was 25 and working in the TD Tower, I'd be all over this place. But I don't need to drink at some schmance place to escape the unhappiness of my white collar job and first world problems.   WE ATE/DRANK Can't say. Maybe I'll come at 3 p.m. in the afternoon and let you know...  OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  How many hostesses does it take to greet you? Five if you're at Earl's. And yes, they're all judging you. Nice bathrooms though. You're welcome.   I'm sure it's lovely though."}
{"text":"First time at Earl's and won't ever come back. I was here with some coworkers for happy hour during a busy evening?. Our server was rude and inattentive. We could never find her and thought she was busy severing other tables until we spotted her standing at the bar, with a bunch of other servers, filing their nails! Completely grossed out!"}
{"text":"Chicken on salad was left off...came 10min later and was dry. All other food was good. Server was nice but just wasn't right.a little off  Sever wouldnt let stranger buy our table drinks ....why???!?!?!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about my experience with Earls Tin Palace. We had a gathering of friends and family because we were visiting from out of town and they could not have been more accomodating to our large party. The general manager Jessica made sure to tend to our needs and the staff was friendly, fast and on top of it. We can't wait to come back soon!"}
{"text":"I guess it was another typical version of scaddabush, Jack Astors, or moxie's?  It was super busy when we went (one of those summer nights) and while we were lucky to get a spot outside, the service was pretty slow. Our food was fantastic though - my friend got the tuna salad and I got the Sante fe. It was super flavorful without being overpowering, and with HUGE portions.  Might come again if I want that typical average dinner?"}
{"text":"I was here for a party, so to avoid disapointment we went on a Saturday. Though we didn't have a reservation they were able to fit 12 of us and provide great service. Saturday the martinis are a buck off, so not one to pass up a deal I thouroughly enjoyed several. To eat I chose \"The Big Earl\". A burger that tops 1/2 pound of a Canadian beef. It was topped beautifully and tastes like Mom used to make. It was great! I strongly recoment a visit and I'm looking forward to my next."}
{"text":"This place is always busy for lunch because of its location, make reservations ahead of time.  One of my favourite chain restaurants.  Cajun Chicken Sandwich is what I usually order. I believe they started up in the west coast and moved to Ontario 5-10 years ago."}
{"text":"I always get the Cajun chicken sandwich witch field greens.  Never been here for dinner.  Prefer it over other restaurants in the plaza, seems healthier.  Service is good, they have Tuesday 1/2 off bottles of wine. A steal"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews for this restaurant I was a little weary of my choice, but since I'd already parked and told my friend where to meet me, laziness prevailed.  I still went in with normal standards figuring I'd make my own judgement call.  The restaurant itself is nice - very modern and sleek looking. We were seated in a nice half moon booth, but the windows in that area don't have shades, so due to the time of day, we were somewhat blinded by the glare.  Anyways, the menu is fairly short but nicely has all of the gluten free items marked (and the vegetarian ones are marked too). I had the chicken tortillas with sweet potato fries. I was a little skeptical about two tacos filling me up, but was pleasantly surprised that they did. They were quiet hearty and the fries were great (and they didn't skimp on the serving the way restaurants normally do with sweet potato fries).  My friend had a blue cheese burger which she said was amazing. It was from their new burger menu and even without the bun she thought it was great!   The downsides (and reason for the four star review) - the server, while fairly attentive and competent, was kind of stuck up. Almost like he had better things to do than serve us.    As some have mentioned the place is somewhat expensive, but I've spent the same on dinner at most other restaurants. Maybe it's expensive if you're comparing it to takeout? We paid under $50 for two people - though neither of us had an alcoholic drink.   Overall, good food and I'd likely return. Especially for those sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Surprisingly decent for a restaurant chain.  We arrived after 9p on Heritage Holiday Monday, and virtually everything in the Mission was closed . . . except Earls.  Normally open until midnight on Mondays, it was open until 11p.  Roxanne was our waitress (super sexy) and she knew the menu cold.  When I inquired about vegetarian options and the kung pao, she was aware that the corporate office was planning on changing the menu to not use chicken stock and make it vegetarian but she wasn't sure if that change had been implemented.  It had been.  The Kung Pao noodle dish was good, not great, but much better than the corn-starchy crap that often constitutes chain-restaurants' forays into Asian cuisine.  I also tried the White Rhino Ale, which was quite good for a home-grown brew, sold only at Earl's.  I'd definitely go again in a pinch, but much prefer to eat and patronize local eateries.  Mercato this was not."}
{"text":"I'm a bit hesitant to leave a review because mine will not be favourable in comparison to others posted here.  Firstly, I'm Sauga born and bred. Therefore, it takes quite a bit to get me to go downtown, particularly during the winter because traveling is always a major hassle. Alas, I was headed to a friend's birthday party so I went along.  Now, I've been to Earls in Mississauga @ Sq1 before and I've never had a problem. It's not my absolute favourite place to grab a bite but I've always had good service and have been attended to quickly.  We went to this particular Earls on King Street last Saturday for a birthday party (as mentioned). There were roughly 12 of us, and my friend had made reservations several days prior to ensure we would have a table.  When we arrived (on time might I add!) we were told they couldn't find anyone with her name for the 9:30 reservation, despite her having confirmed the day before with the restaurant that she would still require the reservation. This is obviously not what you want to hear on a cold night after having traveled from a different city. It took over 10 minutes with the manager involved to finally figure out that WAS our reservation, but whoever had taken it had put the name down wrong.  Great! Then, we were told the tables weren't ready yet so to please give them about 15 minutes to set everything up. Fine. They brought out some small apps for us to munch on while we waited. Over 30 MINUTES LATER, we were told they weren't quite ready yet but decided to place us at a high table instead so as to not make us wait any longer. Now, if we made reservations and we were on time, why weren't these tables ready?  Fast forward to us sitting down and getting ready to order, that was another mess in itself. Our waitress took half the table's orders but not the other half. How does that work? The birthday girl had to stop her and tell her I hadn't been asked my order yet because 11/12 people had gotten their food and had started eating meanwhile my order hadn't even been taken yet!  I ordered the birthday girl a Long Island and 20 minutes later nothing had come. I had to stop the waitress again and remind her I had ordered a drink for it to finally come out.  I normally bite my tongue because I really hate making complaints against restaurants seeing as staff are always busy and I'm sure tired by the end of the day. But seriously this was probably one of my worst dining experiences ever and I left feeling like it was a terrible waste of money + trip. I really shouldn't have tipped but I felt bad for the girl so I did anyway.  There's no way I'm ever coming downtown to eat here again! I learned the first time."}
{"text":"What a great place to drink after all the other restaurants close Mon to Sun open til 2am! Dynamite Roll sooo delicious! 4 dollar bar rail after 9pm! Also an amazing patio! Manager was so accommodating by allowing us to sit there all night even though they claimed it was tooo cold!"}
{"text":"Not bad for, but I was looking for more. I saw a line up and I thought wow... it will be amazing, but it was OK. If you want to have a fun night out, a quick restaurant after shopping, or just hanging out with friends, you can definitely consider this restaurant."}
{"text":"Earls is located in the financial district at the corner of King and York streets. I came here to meet a friend for dinner and watch some playoff hockey during the work week.  I arrived about 5PM and this place was already packed. The patio was standing room only and luckily my friend had arrived early and snagged us a table, otherwise I think we would have been in for a long wait. Earls is a businessey sports bar, lots of tvs everywhere and lots of suits to match. Pay attention to the tips here - you get shitty service if you're not in a suit. Our server was an airhead to begin with but she really didn't care to do much in terms of serving us, which was bad for her since we easily had over $70 in alcohol alone.  I ended up getting a margarita and had two of them... although they didn't taste like too much, they went down just fine ;) . Eventually we got a hold of our waitress to order some appetizers (we started off with drinks and weren't looking to be rushed but we could NOT catch her) and ended up with the baby calamari served with tzaziki. The calamari came out and were a good temperature, nice and crispy and teeny little rings. Very good for picking at with a friend. The tzaziki sucked though. It was basically yogurt and cucumber chunks, nothing special and overall, the the dish just lacked for me.  After we wrangled down our server again, we ordered dinner. I ended up getting the cajun chicken caesar and my friend ordered the steak. He specifically asked not to get the potatoes because he wouldn't eat them and they'd just go to waste. Lo and behold, our food came out and there was the side. Not a huge deal but he wasn't too impressed. My salad was fine, the caesar part of it was nothing special, but the cajun chicken was tasty. The massive piece of bread I got was good but it was overwhelming on the plate and just too much bread for one person.  Given that we arrived a few hours before playoffs and that people weren't really watching the game much here, I can only attribute so much of the ridiculously loud atmosphere to the game. I think this is generally a hot spot in the financial district but for me, it was far too loud in the bar area and we were yelling at each other all night. Unfortunately, with the wait, my friend didn't have too much choice as to where we got a table and we did prefer to have the tvs to watch the game.   The service here pretty much sucked. Our server would walk by our table and head to tables with adequately dressed men (I work in an office so my attire was nothing to shake a stick at and so does my friend) and ignored us until we made eye contact. She didn't listen, didn't pay attention to our orders and I was generally unimpressed.  Overall, not a place I would recommend to anyone. I hear they have great food but nothing on the menu stuck out as \"wow I need to try that\" and the general atmosphere wasn't inviting. If I come back, I'll try the dining room, but this will not make my list of places to try again anytime in the near future."}
{"text":"Great waitress and great service. Loved the mussels and the sushi platter. Would absolutely go back again!"}
{"text":"The service was average and the food was below average. They have a decent drink menus with specials daily. Avoid the chicken sandwich as well as the steaks. Steaks were cooked to wrong temperature and sandwich was bland. Overpriced for what you get, you'll be better off going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Excellent ribs, fell off the bone. Excellent potato salad. Coleslaw was fresh but bland, disappointing to this COle slaw aficionado. Terrific cake dessert.   Excellent service, gorgeous help, and a great atmosphere. A bit pricey and I do not appreciate the small cocktails, but this is due to Gestapo tactics of Toronto / Canadian politicians.   Nice job!!"}
{"text":"This is a nice Earl's location with a covered \"atrium\" that gives the feel of being on a nice outdoor patio, while being inside. I had a drink and clam chowder only, but like pretty much every Earl's I got a consistent service and food quality. Good spot for lunch or a casual dinner."}
{"text":"I've had food here before and it's okay. Pub food with a more elegant spin to it. What I want to write about today is the service. It was fantastic. We sat at the bar watching the soccer game and only had drinks. Drinks came quickly, and each time we were done we were quickly taken care of. Thanks earls!"}
{"text":"Chad W is far too polite. Yes, it is busy. The lounge is usually filled with DBs and aging businessmen who always seem to be hugging the waitresses. The Earl's lounge hugging phenomenon creeps me out - although I'm considering starting a drinking game for it.  So, just know what you are getting yourself into. If you want to go stare at girls with \"Calgary Tans\" (the slightly orange, fake glow of winter in Calgary), wear your Affliction t-shirt and get paid a decent amount of attention by the waitress, while watching whatever game is on - this is a great place for it! Having said that, everyone knows the girls at Joey's are better looking and show more skin (and the Ahi Tuna Salad at Joey's is worth the trip for us girls too).  Note: There is nothing wrong with Earl's. The food, for this kind of place, is pretty decent, although I've had food poisoning from there twice and found styrofoam in my salad. Not exactly perfect, but hey, these things happen."}
{"text":"Great place.  Can't go wrong.  Consistent as always.  New patio is great.  Get a seat bun the fire and enjoy a good evening!"}
{"text":"We had a staff of 15 for our Christmas Party on Friday December 19, 2014.  I arrived earlier than our scheduled 2:30 p.m. reservations, as I was the organizer and wanted to ensure everything is just right.  As I arrived, I realized that they had reserved our table on the \"noisier\" bar side, as opposed to the \"less nosier\" dining room side.  As I communicated this to Mikey (GM), he took immediate action and ensure we would be accommodated for on the quieter side.  He was so sweet and he checked in with me every few minutes with updates.  Our staff arrived on time and MIkey and his staff did their magic.  A complementary champagne was provded by Mikey and the food and drinks were wonderful!  Extremely satisfied customers and will definitely be back for our next company function.  Thank you to all the afternoon staff of Earl's - King Street."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at how much earls has revamped there look. The staff was very well dressed and clean looking. The food was a million times better than I remember. Going to come back more often. Hope they keep it up."}
{"text":"Not impressed!  We went to Earls on a Friday evening to grab a bite before a show.  The ambience of the restaurant (inside) was impressive, with soft lighting and nice decor.  It definitely caters to a 20-something crowd with loud music and the after-work hustle and bustle.  However, the food was less than satisfactory.  The waitress arrived at our table, upon hearing that we're \"new here\" she did not identify any \"specials\" or recommendations, and then looked at us with bewildered eyes when I asked about the ingredients in a menu item due to an allergy.  When the food arrived, it was bland (limited-if any-seasoning) at best.  The chicken tacos in particular could have benefited from some greens and more feta.  After telling me that she (the waitress) \"didn't think\" my allergy ingredient was in my meal, we found out that it was and then I never had a chance to get her attention again to let her know.  On a positive note, the bartender is on top of things with quick, well-mixed drinks.  Overall, I will not be back to this place and would not recommend to others."}
{"text":"Don't bother. Went here with some friends for a girls night and our experience was extremely disappointing.  The staff were lovely don't get me wrong but I feel that earls is implementing cost saving measures without regard to customers. My issue is with the wine. They advertised bottles of wine. We purchased the most expensive white on the menu. The wine arrived in a carafe. Immediately red flags went up, I asked for the bottle to verify we were being served what we paid for. Our waiter informed us they no longer serve bottles they have wine on tap and fill carafes.  As it was a girls night we didn't want to disrupt our night by making a big issue about this but I will not be returning based on this.  After hearing about the beef scandal I will definitely not be spending my hard earned money on this company."}
{"text":"I am giving this place such a high rating based off one visit and because I had one of the tastiest burgers from a chain restaurant that I've ever had in my life. I was thinking about it days later, and often still. LOL! What burger was this? The Bronx Burger. WOWEEE. It was cooked deliciously with crispy crunchy burger parts on the outer parts...and SO JUICY inside. Served on a soft bun and topped with a crispy, greasy (in a good way!) onion ring it was so dang good. I was NOT expecting to leave so satisfied but all three in my party ordered burgers and not one of us had a bad experience! I also enjoyed the fries. All round my new favorite spot to come when I'm downtown! I'm looking forward to coming back.  One Caveat - they do seem to change their menu often, so I really hope they don't take away this burger! Get it while you can..."}
{"text":"The lounge and restaurant are very nice.  I was here with a few friends and all I ordered was a glass of wine.  Two of them shared the Chocolate Sticky Toffee Pudding.  I picked at the chewy toffee shell that held the ice cream.  The desert presentation is beautiful and the toffee shell was pretty good, but I don't think it's worth $8.    The quirky part about this experience is that our server was too lazy to walk around us.  Instead, she kept waving her hand at my friends to pass their glasses so she could either top up their water or wine.  I was fine because I sat at the edge of the table but she irritated my friends.  Just a little bizarre.  Honestly, we didn't tip much."}
{"text":"Ahhh Earl's...where the secret of their success isn't so secret.  It would be easy to write this place off as an upscale Hooters/Twin Peaks type of joint, and it honestly sort of is, but you know what?  I think that even if the waitresses weren't smoking hot (and for the most part, fun and cool to boot!) and scantily clad, I'd still go!  Last night's visit marked the sixth time I'd been, all as part of some business drinks/dinner occasion, and I must say that Earl's is six for six in good times had.  The food is consistently good.  Not great, but pretty darn good (the lamb popsicles are a bit overpriced, but delish).  Drinks?  Suprisingly affordable, and they get a tip of the hat for having an affordable wine list that seems to stick around the 4x markup rule.  I'm not an oenophile, and thus not too picky, so having a good selection in the $30 - $35 a bottle range is a nice touch.  Extra marks for the cool male bartenders too.  Normally at a place like this, they're either extremely aloof or extremely annoyed.  Friendly and helpful here though!  Atmosphere?  Solid.  Nicely designed, and a pretty classy joint all around.  Service...good as well!  The waitresses are pretty attentive and knowledgable, and frankly, way exceeded my expectations.  So you know what?  Scratch my opening comment.  I think that the T&A definitely helps Earl's create buzz and gets people in the door, but the quality of their overall offering gets them to come back.  Four stars."}
{"text":"Downtown location is great.  Especially when it's not too busy (like Sunday mornings!) and we get time to enjoy the food and ambience.  The serving staff are always on point and keep an eye out for you.   Gets real busy during the downtown business rush so I try to avoid those times.   Overall a good consistent food experience that makes me want to come back often."}
{"text":"Awesome place to drink with my bankers buds and chat with lawyer stuff. But Thursday is when is happening.  Sexy waitresses helps a lot to get the fluids going"}
{"text":"I really wished I checked the reviews on Yelp before coming here.   I might have saved a myself from a disappointing night.   Visited on a Saturday night after 11 pm. Kitchen is open until 15 minutes before closure. So that was a plus at least.   Sitting in the lounge area, there was music and several people which were having pints and socializing.  Another plus. But that's where it ends.    Apparently Earls on Saturday has drink specials.  Which are server didn't bother to mention. After asking her twice for drink recommendations did we get notice the house beers were special price for a pint.   The final total for the house pint was $6, which isn't cheap, and the beer tasted like water. So I don't recommend.    Also our server neglected to tell us about the $4 rum and coke special as well as other liquor specials too (until after I paid the bill and gave a tip I wish I could take back).  Which we would have gladly forgone the beer.  THIS is a big negative and if you decide to go... Question them.    I also ordered a Steak 6oz as we really came for food.   It was the most disappointing steak I've ever had and not worth the $25 they charge for it.  It was loaded with salt for flavouring.  The only thing good about it is they cooked it properly.    I don't think it's worth it to step in there again as it's just a waste of money with other locations near by.  Save your money and go to the pub or something.    Summary:  Pros: + Kitchen open until 15 minutes before last call + Saturday has music playing and seems to have people grabbing drinks/pints for the night.  Not packed but not dead either   Cons: - Food is loaded with salt as flavouring is missing - Drinks are expensive, specials are inflated priced that are reduced - Drink specials are not told by servers and need to be worked out of them (shouldn't need effort to order drinks) - House beer taste like water  - Does not offer half pints for Guinness and Stella like other bars  Save your money and don't go.  And Carley, next time tell people the specials.  Enjoy your 15% tip, if I could have taken it back I would."}
{"text":"Having lived in Vancouver for many years I'm thoroughly  familiar with Earls and while it's okay insofar as chain restaurants go its nothing special beyond that.  You will notice many reviews here talk about how the food was less than stellar or the service lacking in some instances which I think speaks directly to what this particular location is all about, and that's the girls dressed in short skirts showing plenty of cleavage. It's no mistake this place is mainly filled up with guys on any given night.   I credit management for comping meals and drinks but it shouldn't be because your product failed to deliver. It speaks directly to the weakness of the business model which relies on the T and A to get the customers through the door versus the quality of food or service. On a personal note some of their liquor prices are outrageous. $14.50 for an average red wine is a wee more than I paid in Vancouver so I suspect I'm subsidizing the rent in this location a bit more.  All in all this is an okay place to drop in after work but by no means is it a place worth lining up for or waiting 45 minutes for a table."}
{"text":"Not my first time at Earls! Last te was the one in Vaughn! All I remembered was I ordered the steak and it was just a dry steak, no sauce, a few fries!  Thought I wud give the dt location a go, considering wed is their wings special!  First off how does a restaurant \"lose\" a reservation? Thank goodness it was for two and not for a large party! I had called two days ago to book, the girl took down my first and last name and number! I asked the girl if it was true that they had a wings night special as per their website it's $6/a pound?  She said yes that's right! I even confirmed if it had to be in the bar area (coz Moxie has a their own wing specials only at the bar lounge area) She had confirmed it was available at the dining area too!  Because they were not able to accommodate 7:30 so I had booked 8pm as that was the only availability! Upon arrival, no reservation, not for 7:30, not for 8:00! So I had to sit down & wait 25 mins for a table only to be to told by the hostess when asked that there were no wing specials! She has never heard of that! So I pulled out my phone & showed her the Earls website! After going around in circles, she said she will check for me! Long story short clueless hostess!   Wings were tiny! Turned out to be $9.25 (reg $12)  Good Beer special though, Rhino pint for $5!  Coz the wings were so tiny, ordered dessert! Sticky toffee chocolate pudding with vanilla ice cream $8.75 was amazing! That almost made up for a horrible arrival experience!   With its crazy crowd, bimbo hostess who can't even take down a reservation  needless to say I doubt I will be back!  One star for the cute waiter, another for the awesome finish to a horrible dining experience!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.   I've been here a few times since coming to Toronto and I keep wanting to go back for more. My fiancee and I went for dinner last Thursday and it was busy but we got a table right away. It was a little loud but that didn't really bother me. I love the atmosphere, it has a warm casual feel.   The food was great, I had the grilled fish tacos and they were some of the best I've had in a long time. My fiance had the salmon which was also very good.  Service was great, I love how pretty much all the servers are dressed up and very attractive... the good service is a bonus.   Also pitchers of beer are very reasonable at only $16. I ordered one for myself since it didn't really  make sense to order by the pint... i can't stop at just one beer, come on. I can't wait to go back when it's a little warmer and sit in the outside patio.   Earl's is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Have been to several Earl's locations in Canada. The one in Calgary is a nice location by a mall and airport hotels.  Server was attentive and friendly and food was good. I had the daily fish special which was a salmon with brown sugar and dijon crust.  Was served with rice and roasted vegetables. The vegetables were carrots and beets, which are my two least liked vegetables, so they substituted a caesar salad for the roasted vegetables.  My co-worker had one of the steaks and was happy with the selection.  I would go back to this location."}
{"text":"Very nice Bar to enjoy with your friends, we been there several times and we always liked all the drinks, the food unfortunately is An OK in general. The decor and the service are top notch!  Try their caesar (drink) and the dip for an appetizer, really good."}
{"text":"Staff was insanely friendly. Appetizers were great. However, my thai food was burnt, my friend's orange juice had fermented, and other people got rather small portions of their food."}
{"text":"Great place for after work drinks (also good drink specials) and their food is really good too! The service is pretty slow, but probably because this place is always so packed."}
{"text":"A plush place packed with pretty people on a pint-sized patio.  The food is actually quite good, and you can't beat paying $4.50 for a fairly decent cocktail or pint of beer.  I've only ever been there on Thursdays when the patio is always stupid-busy, so getting a reservation way in advance is highly recommended. Unless you're hoping to bump shoulders (and other bits) with the throngs of eye-candy in suits or short skirts, I'd recommend skipping the patio and staying inside...where the ambiance is hip and the service a lot better. Plus, you avoid getting into a verbal rumpus with the patio-bouncer-fella, whose strict adherence to the fire safety code would make any fire marshal proud.  Great place to people watch (the yuppie suited variety), get hit on by inebriated wanker bankers, or enjoy a very good lunch/dinner on non-busy days.  But if you're on (or hoping to get into) the patio, be prepared to wait....and wait...and wait..."}
{"text":"This is a \"test\" Earls. I have so far boycotted until further notice for the following reasons:   - menu changes were bad, nearly 0 selections for vegans/vegetarians - using PAPER un-sustainable menu's which the server says they toss after 2-4 uses - slow - 16 year old girls in high heels they cannot walk in working there"}
{"text":"Welp, I have to do it. I have to smash this location in particular, in the kisser.   When I am in Calgary for business I will go to this place because they have tofu and larger tables to meet with staff etc...the service has NEVER been good on the lounge side - ever.   After going here for nearly 5 years on and off the final straw was this month (Feb) when we arrived to actually meet friends in the lounge. They were there for 10 minutes before us an an un-bussed table waiting to be acknowledged.   We tried several times to flag down a server - and finally had to beg a busser (after bussing our own table) to find us someone to take our money.  The usual brand of college aged, aloof & ditsy type person was offered to us. We had to beg twice more for a couple of rounds of drinks and traded horror stories about that location.   To add, I was the only one who ordered anything because everyone else wasn't going to pay $$$$$ for poor service. I ordered a side salad add tofu. It came on a side plate, about 1.5 cups of \"mixed greens out of the bag\" and 2oz of soggy tofu for a grand total of $10.50.   (Later in the week I was in Vancouver on business as well and found the same dish for $7.50 served in the lounge by somewhat more attentive staff).  Calgary isn't a great foodie hotspot but these \"Donnelly\" type locations should have their butts in gear after decades on the food scene. It's a repetitive business that is just sucking wind. I don't care WHO serves me as long as they care that I am there.   Officially, boycotting Earls Restaurants in Canada."}
{"text":"Well Earls. We've never been good buds.   I don't mind Earls for an easy vegetarian meal. They put a mushroom sammy on the menu that  I thought may rule - greasy bread.   You can't expect much from glorified fast food however,   This location needs a good power scrub and that's about all I can recommend.   If you're in a rush and need decent fast food...I guess this works."}
{"text":"Great location and nice outdoor seating. But as for the food, alfredo with prawn was okay and chicken taco was subpar. Their wings and the white peach sangria were pretty good though. Overall not too impressed."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Toronto! Beautiful patio and genuine staff that serve high quality drinks and dishes. Perfect for all occasions in the heart of the financial district. Highly recommend the Bibimbap and Chocolate Sticky Toffee Pudding, so delicious."}
{"text":"Here's the thing, yes Earl's locale is within the douchey financial sector, but I will say that on the weekends it's the perfect place to get your high maintenance late night noshing on when you're (god forbid) hanging around the club district and when a simple hotdog or burrito won't do, plus Earl's is hella classier than eating shitty greased up street food, while sitting on the sidewalk watching drunk teenagers hobbling in U-G-L-Y platform stripper shoes tripping over their own vomit!  After being turned away from 4 restaurants at 11 pm ( yeah I'm looking very dissappointedly at you Fune!!) on a Saturday nite,  Earl's was a godsend as they're open late til 2am and feature a decent menu. We waltzed in at about 11:30 got seated (in a fancy-pants semi circle pleather upholstered booth!) and served within minutes!!!   In a nutshell Earl's is pretty much the equivalent of Joey's in terms of grandiose modern interior style, presentation, menu and of course the ebulliant and purposefully attractive female waitstaff.  This is no coicidence given both chains are the properties of duelling members of the West Coast's mega \"restaurentrepreneurs\" the Fuller clan.  Joie T was not kidding when she mentioned about the hot girls!  Of the two times I've been here, all the hostesses and servers were indeed pretty and nicely dressed up, save for the one buttaface bar girl who compensated by wearing a much sluttier dress vs. the other servers?!  Is this considered the official bargirl uniform?  Maybe she was channelling the nearby club district's tacky dress code?!?  My first time here, I ordered the fish tacos and comparitively speaking, the fish tacos at Joey's are a little better taste wise (Joey's version is batterfried fish vs Earl's is grilled) but admittedly the Earl's version is fresh and had plenty large chunks of fish.   My second time here, I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken Salad which features avocado, black beans, corn, dates and organic greens, peanut lime vinaigrette, crispy tortillas and a succulent half breast cajun spiced chicken.  This was easily the most flavourful and filling salad I've had in a while .  FYI the desserts here are orgasmic, especially the Chocolate Sticky Toffee Pudding, which is a dessert of Lucullan orgiastic properties. Decadently moist chocolate cake with a centre that's lava-like and oozing of warm chocolate/caramel...certainly worth fighting for the last forkfull.  Yucky Martini Alert:  the \"Doctors Orders\", while sounding like a \"healthy\" bevvie is more of a bitter remedy as my dining companion grimaced whilst sipping it gingerly and likened it to the taste of Robitussin cough syrup. Ack!! Truthfully though, it's probably great for colds!   So if you're looking for a more refined late night eatery with prompt friendly service and a diverse menu, then please don't hesitate to get you're midnight cravings (savoury or voyeuristic) satisfied at Earl's."}
{"text":"My group of 3 ordered the Cajun Chicken Cheddar Sandwich, Cajun Chicken, and Fettuccine Alfredo. It was super yummy and had me satisfied. I definitely recommend ordering the sandwich, but I think the fettuccine is the best deal (the portion for that one is a lot bigger). What was really interesting was that the tortilla soup that came with my sandwich is just as it sounds: avocado, sour cream, tomatoes, tortilla chips - but soup form! It tastes better than you think, but beware because it's a little spicy.  The service was equally great! The waitress would check in on us occasionally, and made sure to give us enough time to order. When we were paying for our meal, she accidentally swapped the prices of our meals so my friend paid $5 less than he was supposed to and almost had me pay $5 more! She was extremely apologetic when I pointed it out to her. She said my friend didn't need to make up for the $5 because the payment was already made and it was her fault.  One thing I didn't really like, however, was that the server didn't tell us when things were upgrades to the meal. For example, since I ordered the sandwich, it comes with fries. What she told me though was that I could choose between salad, soup, and fries. Saying it like that, I thought it was all the same price so I just opted for the soup. It didn't really matter to me what I had as a side - in fact, I would've said fries had I known soup was an \"upgrade\"! The same happened to my friend with the fettuccine... let's just say we were a bit surprised when we saw the bill."}
{"text":"Great bar, great food, great crowd...even for a downtown spot. Some of the best Creamy Tomato soup that has ever been made."}
{"text":"Always packed, similar to the other chains like Moxie's and Joey, but I always like this one the best out of the 3. Limited beer selection, food is dependably decent. 2 stars for food, 3 for drinking!"}
{"text":"Service and quality are good at this location. I paid nearly $15 for a Caesar salad with Cajun chicken and when it arrived I was very disappointed at how small it was. I think a Wendy's salad is similar in size and quality, so while what I got was excellent, the value seems lacking. I don't find the decor or the dining experience to be worth the $$ extra that you pay."}
{"text":"i came here on sat night for some apps and drinks and felt prompted to write a review due to the lack of service.   i like earls for drinks but not much more. their food is overpriced and not tht tasty. they had 2 oz mojitos on special that are always delish (and they dont skimp on alcohol). my favorite is the rasperry flavour as well as the cucumber one :)   i came a bit late so the bad service for my other friends was already underway. no one came to our table to check on us so i sat there for 15-20 min unable to order a drink and food. one of my girlfriends was trying to pay her bill so we flagged down a gentlemen working there and told him we need someone to help us out with a bill and orders. he said he would send someone over...another 15 min later...NO ONE came!! my girlfriend left her money on the table and had to leave. we had to flag down another server to ask her to help us. the look on her face was pure annoyance and attitude as she took our order. 2 min later our actual server came to our table saying tht she thought someone else was taking care of us ..but now she will take care of us for sure  um..ok? the service after all tht was fine but it was just so irritating. its a saturday night ppl are here to drink and give the resto business we shouldnt be ignored. anyways..we ordered the spinach dip (pretty good) and fettucine alfredo which was super liquidy and tasted like chicken soup.   i had the alfredo last time and it didnt taste like tht so i have no idea what was up with earls this weekend but i dont think il be back for awhile  on the bright side-their patio has a very nice ambiance on a summer night so i really liked that  oh and also we werent offered any kind of discount or anything to make up for the bad service. cool. thanks earls."}
{"text":"Was in town from Washington, DC for a wedding (however, I was born and lived 16 years in TO) and staying downtown.  After watching the Leafs game in Maple Leafs Square we did a bit of sightseeing.  My wife got hungry at about 1 AM so i googled where was serving late night food and drinks.  Ear's came up.  So we headed over.  First impression, great atmosphere!  Loved the ambiance and decor.  The waitresses were very attractive and really friendly.  The appetizers were great.  The wine list was fab (which my wife ordered) and the pours were VERY generous.  They did not have Makers Mark, which i ordered, but they had Woodford, so it was no big deal.  On to the best part... sitting at my table, I looked over about 5 tables down and saw Mark Frasier, Jonathan Bernier, JVR, Morgan Rielly, Jake Gardiner and Frasier McLaren sitting and enjoying some drinks!  I didnt want to bother them, but being from TO and a huge Leafs fan, I had to approach them.  They were more than happy to take a pic with me.  I will definitely head back here next time, for the atmosphere, location, food, drinks, waitresses and quite possibly, another celebrity sighting."}
{"text":"Ordered take out and it was quick and painless, ready to go when I got there. Server was polite and nice. The Santa Fe salad with chicken was so good. The peanut lime sauce was one of the best sauce I have tried. Good work !"}
{"text":"This review is going to be short and sweet since a lot has already been said in prior reviews about the patio and decor.  I had lunch at Earl's yesterday and order the Santa Fe Chicken Salad with  avocado, black beans, corn, dates, feta and organic greens, peanut lime vinaigrette, crispy tortillas, cajun spiced chicken.  It was amazing.  The portion was huge, the dressing tasted light and not overpowering and the chicken was spicy and delicious. I would definitely order this again.  My colleague ordered the curry chicken and said it was very good as well.  The food arrived quickly and the service was very good.  I was pleasantly surprised by my experience."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner on Saturday night with two kids and two seniors.  They all had the burger.  I ordered the chicken curry which promised to be spicy.  I didn't find it to be particularly spicy (I like very spicy food) or very good.  It was just ok.    The burgers, however, were very tasty (and enormous!).  I was not, however, impressed that for an extra $2 you could \"upgrade\" to sweet potato \"spears\" (instead of fries) with the burger.  The sweet potato spears amounted to approximately 8 relatively small pieces some of which were burnt.  I thought that was really cheesy of the restaurant to charge extra for.  I would have taken a picture but the lightening is very dim.    On the strength of another reviewer, we shared the spinach/feta dip.  It was good (while hot) but the bread it came with was not deep fried (as mentioned by the other reviewer) which was fine with me.    I had hoped to get the Smores dessert for the kids but was told that this was seasonal and it was not available.  We ordered the sticky toffee pudding was pretty good.  The portion size was huge!    This place is on the pricey side for what you get.  You may want to keep in mind that this is a very noisy restaurant.  We had to practically yell to hear each other talk.    We had an issue with my daughter's meal and our server and the manager handled it very professionally by taking it off of the bill and comping our desert.  But for the attentive service, I would have given this restaurant 2 stars.  Despite this, I doubt that I will be back unless I am craving a good burger."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I'm not a fan of Toronto's upscale casual chain dining scene. The past few years have seen a proliferations of Milestones and Moxies, Pickle Barrel Grandes and Joey-whatever-mall-you're-ins. And that's just up at Yorkdale.   Most of these chains seem to vie for the title of placeholder, for when the Cheesecake Factory finally arrives and blows them all out of the water.   Funny enough, a few western chains have slowly crept onto Ontario streets. Funnier still, these places seem to do a much better job with the concept than their predecessors. What they lack in deep-fried french toast, they make up for with more adventurous meals, friendly (and let's face it, more attractive) staff. and a greater sense of style.   The room is huge, dominated by plush leather banquettes suitable for gawking at the rubes on the street. Sleelly attired servers offer water and take drink orders, and make sure our glasses are never half-empty. The food itself is a step or two above other chains. Chicken curry is pleasant, but could use more heat and less salt. It's a massive portion, though; and I've got naan to spare. Beer battered fish is suitably flaky if a bit pale; the chips are properly crisp.   Hardly the best meal I've had, even on this tourist trap-saturated stretch of King. The room and the view make up for a lot, though."}
{"text":"I came here when this location first opened and I was super disappointed and never came back. I came here tonight for my cousins birthday and I was so impressed! Everything I ate tasted so good. We all ate a but of each others food so I had the opportunity to try various things.   For starters we had the spinach and artichoke dip and the dynamite roll. Delicious! The dip had a perfect cheesy consistency and the bread was soft on the Inside and crispy in the outside. A must try! The dynamite roll was good as well, to he honest I don't think I've ever had a bad dynamite roll. I didn't taste any mango but I have no complaints it was good  For our mains we had the curry chicken, mushroom and chicken fettuccini, chicken tacos with clam chowder and steak. Everything was good is say my least favourite was the pasta dish. It had more of a cream of mushroom flavour and less of a Alfredo flavour. The chicken tacos had a nice kick to it and the curry chicken tasted surprisingly authentic.  For dessert we had the strawberry rhubarb crumble and the sticky toffee dessert. They were okay but not my preferential flavour profiles when it comes to dessert. If you like chocolate go for the sticky toffee (I'm not much of a chocolate fan). They also need to serve a larger portion of ice cream with their desserts.  Our drinks were refreshing and unique. Not your standard pi√±a colada and Long Island ice teas type of place. I really enjoyed the raspberry mojito!"}
{"text":"My experience at earls tonight just blew me away. From start to finish they were on point. From the moment I walked in a I was greeted with a smile and the greeter attempted to make small talk as she seated us. My server arrived promptly with a smile and offered great suggestions. My food was full of flavour. I had the 3 cheese dip, dynamite rolls, blackened chicken, pineapple juice and the vanilla pomegranate mojito. Absolutely no complaints. Our food came extremely fast not even 5 minutes and our server regularly check on us. It was great I just wish I remembered my servers name to shout her out!"}
{"text":"Reliable, and a better steak than the Keg.  Earl's is ubiquitous in Vancouver (my previous home), so I was interested to see how they stacked up here.  Gotta say, it was very favourably.  We were parched and ready for rest after a long walk to the waterfront with not quite enough liquid on hand.  We were really impressed with the size of the incredibly active and bright patio, but were even more so with the coool dark inside of the restaurant (which was what we needed, some cold air).  One of the best medium-rare steaks I've ever had, in all honesty.  It being summer, they have warm potato salad and coleslaw on their menu of sides, and we substitute that for the usual mash & veg, and it was just a wonderful meal all around.  Beer for the husband, Iced tea for me, both in amazingly frosty glasses.  Our waiter was a doll, and as I say, the kitchen staff were obviously on top of their game because holy cow, what a steak. Tender, cooked exactly right, and holy cow I am drooling about it right now.  =)  We followed up with the campfire s'mores dessert, which is a specialty which is not always on the menu, but when it is, get it!  It used to be just one s'more, which is why we ended up getting one each... and it's now two per order!  So we tucked into them anyway, even though we were getting pretty full at this point.  Didn't need to eat again until the next day, so it certainly paid off.  Going to definitely come back often, when I want a reliable experienced spot for a relaxing time with friends.  Now hand me something to clean my keyboard with..."}
{"text":"Nice place.  I've only been twice but you know what you're going to get.  Food is surprisingly good.  Had the bacon burger last night while drinking my face off and it rocked my world!  So good.  Sure, the bartenders could have checked on us more, but I was happy with the experience and will totally go back."}
{"text":"The biggest problem with Earls is it is located in a douchey area. BUT if you are a Bay street type and enjoy hanging with the Bay Street crowd, than I imagine you would rate this place a solid 4 star.  Earls has a really nice patio. I have tried visiting a few times in the summer but the place was way too packed to find a table. Now that the weather is cooling off it's possible to be seated outside. (They have heat lamps!)  I was also pleasantly surprised at the cost of drinks here. They have daily specials. We visited on a Tuesday and had some delicious $4.99 bellinis. Great price. Thursdays sounds promising too, with a large cocktail list all at $4.99 pricing. Normal cost is $7, which really is reasonable too.  The waitstaff there were all extremely attractive yet dumb as shit. (Just how I like em!)"}
{"text":"we came here for brunch last weekend. We were seated right away and our server was great.They don't have a lot of options for brunch but they do have an all day breakfast that looked delicious. My girlfriend ordered it and couldn't get enough.   The only issue I have with this location is the location its self. parking isnt great and getting in and out of the place isnt all that great either."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my co-workers and ordered the following:  - Earls Famous Clam Chowder: not as creamy as I expected, but still very good and filling - Chili Chicken & Wontons: chicken was amazing, not too much batter and so flavourful with the cucumbers, the dish could have gone without the wontons  - Cherry Long Island: good, but slightly too sweet because of the cherry cola  Service was good, I would definitely recommend making a reservation around lunchtime as it gets very busy!  I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is a 10! As many others have said, it's a corporate after-work hang-out but it should not be overlooked by those who happen to not be wearing suits. The patio is amazing. The service was quick and attentive. The girls who work here are total sweethearts.  This also happens to be the place where I had (no exaggeration) the best salad I've EVER had. I ordered the Prawn & Quinoa salad thinking it would be a nice healthy choice, and it ended up blowing me away to the point where I became an amateur food photographer for the first time in my life. If you're in downtown TO, this place is not to be missed."}
{"text":"Honestly, I would give the food and drinks probably 3 stars. However because of the price, I had to take a star away. The flavor of the food did not warrant the steap price. The menu had nice variety (and changes with the season) but the overall experience of the  meal was unremarkable.  The only thing I could say was really nice was the atmosphere (especially sitting outside on a nice day.) However, I went for lunch and my meal was about $20 (with tax and tip without drinks) That, to me, is too much for a lunch meal. It was ok, but I can easily get that level of quality for at least half the price somewhere else. For instance, I would go to Thai Rose Garden just down the street and get the lunch buffet if I want to spend that much money.   I got the Thai noodles, some others in my party got the yam fries, soup, Cesar salad, and a chicken sandwich. Although everything was presented beautifully, no one in my party remarked on how delicious the food was. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food but no one was wow-ed. I guess I just expect to be blown away for that price.  The drinks were also good, but again, the prices were just a little stiff for me. However, I would say that I would probably go here again for an after-work drink if only for the atmosphere. But then again, I don't know if I just want to pay $20 for atmosphere."}
{"text":"Rating: 3.5/5  I'm from Edmonton, so I've been to many different Earls locations many times. I've also been to the King street location several times, and it is as consistent as other locations.   The lounge is always totally bumping at the King Street Earls after work hours. It can be pretty hard to find a table, but once you do, it's a fun time. Earls has great drinks, but they've recently  gotten rid of a lot of their drink specials. I don't think that this location has happy hour drinks anymore. Despite this, I love their mojitos.  The food at Earls is also consistently good. Some of my favourite dishes include the Dynamite prawn rolls, the chicken caesar salad, the chicken and brie sandwich and the hunan kung pao. The fries are generally awesome, aside from the odd time where the oil hasn't been changed, and they're overly greasy and soggy. The food is nothing particularly mind blowing, but it's consistent and the ingredients are fresh.   The service at Earls, however, is totally hit or miss. Sometimes it takes forever to get a menu and drinks. I also find that the service staff who aren't busy don't go around to other tables to bring drinks and clear the table."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday. We were greeted promptly and sat on the patio (because who wants to sit indoors in the summer?). Our server, Kylie, showed up immediately with menus, chatted for a minute and left us to peruse the oh so tasty choices.  I ordered the eggs benny and a mimosa. My drink only came to $6 and the food was amazing. There was just the right amount of delicious Rosemary infused potatoes; the shaved ham was heavenly; and the sourdough bread was a nice departure from the traditional English muffin.  We were in a bit of a hurry, so we asked for our bill early, but our server still came back and checked on us periodically.  I highly recommend this place for desert, drinks, brunch, lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Earls Tin Palace is a staple restaurant for my friends and I. Whether we are going out for dinner or just a few drinks and some appetizers, we can always count on Earls to deliver. Definitely the best restaurant chain that I have tried. The Caesars are by far the best ones in the city and the majority of the menu is very good. You typically don't find this kind of quality from chain restaurants. I would recommend Earls Tin Palace to anyone. *Last visit July/17"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite or drinks after work. Trendier than I expected, and also unexpectedly busy for a week night evening. Still lots of space though.  FOOD:  This place has a good variety of bar/pub food and like many trendier places these days, also had several dishes borrowing from other ethnic cuisines (e.g. Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Caribbean, Italian, Mexican etc.).   As I often do, I went for the tried and true, and split a Bacon Cheddar Burger and Fish and Chips. First of all, I was impressed that they were willing to split two portions of both dishes for us, right down to the clam chowder side we had. Toppings were pretty standard (tomatoes, onion, lettuce, pickles, mayonnaise and mustard), but bacon brought out the taste of the juicy burger. The Fish was nicely battered, light, and crispy. Star of the meal was the clam chowder - this was so good I ordered another bowl!  ATMOSPHERE:  Posh spot filled with yuppies and happy hour crew. Spacious and clean, and great place to unwind after work.  SERVICE:  I don't recall our server's name, but she was really on top of things for us, and even laughed at our bad jokes.   VERDICT:  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Since the first time I came here, Earl's has been one of my favourite hangout spots. Never in my life would I have thought I'd like a spot full of bay street suits but I really do like this place, a lot.  The drinks are inexpensive and tasty, the service wonderful, the food delicious (though salty) and reasonably price (you can't go wrong with their $13 delicious delicious Earl's burger), and the atmosphere and vibe is trendy without making you uncomfortable.   Hot waitress help their cause too."}
{"text":"Lunch crowd.  Lotta suits in evidence ... and as a result, it was LOUD, Loud, far too loud for me, anyway!  Hard to hear the staff who spoke too softly to be easily heard above the din.    Otherwise, the staff was very pleasant and helpful.  Had the clam chowder - the clam did not just swim through! - and the salmon, which was excellent!  Special find in a mall restaurant!"}
{"text":"Decent place I always get the ribs and the potato salad that comes with it is really good. Not to many other things I like on the menu. Service and atmosphere is good."}
{"text":"I grew up in Vancouver (where Earl's originated) so having an Earl's in Toronto isn't as big a deal to me as everyone else. Having said that, I went there with a large group the other night and had a pretty good time.  I asked the waitress whether they had a veggie burger, which they don't. I have to say this is a pretty big disappointment. I love a burger (obviously mostly the fixing) and a restaurant that specializes in \"rolls, burgers and buns\" ought to have at least one meat-free sandwichy option. But no.   However, after apologizing that there is no veg. option, the waitress informed me that they do have a \"vegetarian\" as well as \"gluten friendly\" menu, and brought it over right away.   I ended up ordering the Hunan Kung Pao (which I've had before), and it was standard. Hot, plentiful, salty, and pretty darn good. Only problem I have is that is was definitely overly \"oily\" and I definitely felt that later on that night.   All together I dined with 14 people and our meals were brought promptly, were mostly correct, and the servers split the bill for us no problem. Would definitely go back with a group either for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This is one of the busiest after work watering holes of the Toronto financial district. Its always a good idea to call ahead and rsvp for larger groups. Two can always try walking in and if a table is not available, there is always the bar. The pub fare is good quality but its their own Rhino brews that wins it for me. The ambience is up beat and dressy and the music is always good."}
{"text":"Okay, so maybe this place isn't such a \"hidden\" gem after-all, since last night when I came here it was surprisingly busy for a wednesday night!  I really like this place.  I like the feel, the location, and the I like the crowd.  Most people there were after work professionals, aged 25 - 45.  Something about the service was lacking a bit.  2 waitresses came to take our original orders, and then it took a bit too long for our beers to get to us.  But overall the staff was friendly.    Derek"}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a drink.  I came here with a bunch of friends and they were able to seat a large group.  That was great.  Service was ok, nothing spectacular.  Prices were also ok.  They gave a standard assortment of drinks, lots of big TVs with different sporting events on.  I would say Earls out West is better but it's an ok place to hang out downtown."}
{"text":"Great food, attractive waitresses, good local beer; what more could you want? I love this place!   Try the chicken & brie sandwich, I'm addicted. I also like the Dynamite roll but in all honesty I haven't found an item I outright disliked."}
{"text":"Such a great casual atmosphere with loud top 40 music and awesome outdoor space. Nice looking crowd, good drinks and decent casual food. The Ahi tuna salad was fresh and large -- Spanish Gin + tonic was delicious!!! Definitely a great lighter fare option."}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed the setup of this restaurant, they have a kick ass patio. Although I was seated inside, that didn't bother me because the waitress was very helpful and efficient. I had the tuna nachos which I must say were absolutely delicious, flavorful and fresh. I would definitely go back there to try some other interesting items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and enjoy it every time. This restaurant is located in the Square One Shopping Mall which is a great thing since meeting up with friends is always a mission when you are all spread around the city...this is central and a great meeting place. It doesn't matter if you meet for a work lunch or a birthday dinner, this place has it all.   The restaurant gives off the feel of a lounge yet it has a full menu from which you can order delicious meals. If you meet up with friends you can sit in the lounge or near the bar and have appetizers along with drinks. The ambiance is very lounge-like with music playing yet it has television sets playing different games of the evening which then gives it the feel of an upscale bar. The people that attend are also business-like and hence, give it the trendy feel.   The staff is very courteous and always professional. I have had to return drinks because they were not to my tasting, and every time the staff was courteous and polite. The food is good but the full menu doesn't have much for vegetarians or seafood for that matter which is why I give it a 4 instead of a 5."}
{"text":"Since the 80's have eaten at nearly every Earls in Western Canada, my son did a chef apprenticeship with Earls here in Calgary, had always loved there food and ambience. Then I got older and the volume of the music became a problem for me, I adjusted, I made sure I went at quieter times when they were not as busy, this didn't help much as we would sit down with maybe only a dozen tables occupied in the whole restaurant / bar and the music would be just blaring. Suffered this a few times and realized, in my opinion, the loudness seemed to be for the staffs pleasure, not the patrons. This Earls demographics are dominated by 40's thru 60's and 70's age groups and I know many who have stopped going because of the noisiness created by the loud music. The louder the music the louder people need to talk and the louder the atmosphere becomes. Many of us stopped going to Ricky's for breakfast also after they instigated a franchise wide policy of louder music to attract a younger demographic. Our age group was 80% of their business, we have the time and the money, we left them in droves also. There are many smaller independent's that get it and appreciate our business. We miss Earls food and staff but just can't put up with the noise.  (UPDATE) Felt a little bad with my review so gave it another try after over a year of absence, could hear the music before we opened the door (no, the outside speakers weren't on), purposely sat in the dining room and not the lounge, we had brunch, food was good and a great waiter. It was pretty busy, very noisy but we couldn't hear any music. It quietened down as the patrons thinned out. Tipped good and was glad we gave it another shot. They said they are aware of the noise frustrations and are concerned about it."}
{"text":"Good sangria and the appetizers were ok... The ambience was nice and the service friendly. In addition the location is good; so there is nothing to complain about this place!! Yes! I recommend it and I would go back!"}
{"text":"The white sangria was very good and the pizza better than I expected... The service was very friendly, and the ambience was good... In general, I have nothing to complain, even when is not the best place I have been, I would say this is a good place for lunch, if you are in the area..."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and I had the Mango fries as an appetizzer and they were very good!!... As my main dish I had the Grilled Chicken sandwich with Baked Brie and It was Delicious!!.. I really liked it!!!.. and I would recommend it 100%.... I will definitely go back there.. and even when I love to try new things.. I think I might have the same sandwich...  The service was not bad, and the prices were not cheap, but not expensive either...."}
{"text":"At first we walked by and looked through the window to see what it was like inside, it looked like a pub/bar which we weren't interested in. Not knowing anything about Earl's or what it was like, we passed on it for dinner and walked around looking for more options. Starving, we circled back and walked inside Earl's which surprisingly has a dining room we didn't know about as you can't see it from the front.   We were greeted and they sat us down in a nice quiet area of the dining room in the back corner. It was very relaxing. We ordered a bread dip trio, I don't remember what it was called specifically, as an appetizer and it was amazing. We almost liked it more than we did our entr√©es but it was very memorable. What really impressed us is that the hostess and waitresses know the menu in and out, as well as what breads we should eat with each dip. That blew me away.   I had a steak, as I usually do as I rarely cook meats at home. Cooked perfectly as expected. But it came with beets or brussel sprouts. I don't like either, but I haven't tried beets in a long time so that's what I chose. At the end of the night, I still don't like beets. My girlfriend had a wonderful tomato soup with lots of stuff in it. I don't recall what this was, nor do I see it on the menu any more. But it was really hearty, full of favour. Kind of like a rustic soup you would drink on a winter evening. The soup itself seemed really complex, and a little spicy at the end after you drink it. It really lifts the flavours up.   We were too full for dessert, and left after a long day. Left a generous tip though, I was really impressed with the service from start to finish. Even when they check on us to ensure that everything was going ok. Bravo."}
{"text":"This is a premium casual restaurant & bar operating on the same principles as Milestones and Moxie's. There's a level of dependability, ranging from mediocrity to decent, that I've come to like about places like Earls. Reducing the uncertainty factor really helps with dining in bigger groups. The menu has something for everyone.  The hostesses here make me wonder if Barney Stinson is running their HR. There are a lot of them on the floor and there is a good server to table ratio maintained in order to deal with the exceptionally large lunch crowd. Our server was very personable and attentive. She came by at least three or four times to take drink orders or to ask how the food is.   I wasn't particularly wowed by my Italia pizza (found it a bit too dry and salty) but I was impressed by the look of the variety of pastas, salads and the one massive cheeseburger ordered at our table.   It's difficult to find fault in my experience with Earls, so far. It's clean and chic, has good service, and gives you a good bang for your buck (excluding beverages). I would also like to acknowledge their indestructible glassware."}
{"text":"Tuesday- Half Price Bottles of Wine. They have a great selection. Dining room vs lounge option is so nice depending the vibe of your night and the company you're with. Servers are actually personable and engage with you at the tables, vs running through the motions and expecting the tip like at other restaurants in the financial district.......stay for a good time and a long time. Highly recommend for Christmas parties etc. The lounge would be the perfect place."}
{"text":"Your typical mid-scale resto chain with young scandalous waitresses to attract the mainstream crowd of young men. Good local place to hang out for some beers with the boys but not so good place for serious food lovers. you have to admit it's a bustling atmosphere and people do enjoy coming here. great location right in square one mall"}
{"text":"It's definitely one of the better earls in calgary. But then again, earls is earls. The dynamite roll was a weird temperature and same with the spinach and artichoke dip. With that being said, the service was good and the restaurant was nice and clean. Overall a decent enough experience. Once again, much better than the other earls in Calgary."}
{"text":"Earls has never been that great to begin with, and this one is the worst earls by far. Found HAIR in the spinach and artichoke dip and got only a mere apology. The service here has not been good any of the times I've gone and I don't know why I ever went more than once. Bad experience from beginning to end."}
{"text":"Pretty nice place with good decor and a sizable patio during the summer months. They have a lounge side which is a little more casual and reminiscent of an upscale bar, and a dining room side for sit down dinners. Earls is pretty big so they're able to accommodate large groups of people. This is definitely a place where you come for the atmosphere and service (the waiters and hostesses are all super friendly and attentive) more than the food itself.   I've had a few of their drinks here - the Bellini and the mojito. Of those two, the Bellini is definitely better. Not sure if they put any lime juice in it but there wasn't any limes and there wasn't a great big mint taste to it.   The ribs were amazingly soft and easily fell off the bones. The guac on the other hand, could be better; there wasn't a big enough kick to it and tasted a little bland."}
{"text":"I am an old fan of Earls; however, had particularly bad service in the lounge at this Earls recently. It took 25 minutes for our server to greet us once we were seated and then she went to get menu, and then asked for drink order. This continued throughout the night (inefficient and delayed service). Pan bread was stale. Prices have gone up and they have gotten rid of some of their best dishes (particularly the California Pizza!!) This Earls is nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I've been here before and I remember the food I had was good. I got here on a Thursday night and it was so busy. Woohoo they have Halibut and chips! It was a bit pricey but worth it. It was soooo good. I also got the Mill street tank house beer which was pretty good. Veronica was also a good server. I enjoyed my time here and definitely come back to try other things.  This place was BANGIN'! I kind of felt I was underdressed here though."}
{"text":"One of the best locations of Earls, Extremely busy anytime, any day..but they accept reservations so you can always secure a table. If it's summer time, make sure you checkout the patio, it is beautifully setup!  Service at this place is real good, every server we got at anytime were super friendly and helpful. Food is in line with the restaurant's competitors within the same category, but I find it a little more flavourful here versus other restaurants.  The restaurant area is nice and spacious, while the lounge area is mostly high cocktail tables and stool chairs. Located at the Colossus plaza, Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"After I missed out friends' invite to go as group on Sun, I went next day as I had been wanting to go for a while. The place was very busy. We had to sit at bar for a drink first to wait to be seated. It was Monday, after outing with friends and dressing up during the weekend. I decided to ditch my heels and change into something casual comfortable tracksuit (LOL)--TNA top and pants, a  down vest with fur pompoms on d strings for the hood. Yeah knowing exactly what kinda place I was going, I didnt really cared what I was going to \"stand out\" n look \"too cute\" or \"too young\" for the classy environment to humiliate myself. It was a cold rainy day, I just wanted to chill(and be warm lol).  And turned out the service was excellent. I was expecting seeing stuck up high-class-wanna-be-hooters like the waitresses at Joey on Down Mills. The pretty ladies at door and our waitress were exceptionally nice!That made the restaurant Joey  look really bad on service considering Joey owns Earl's which is interesting!   As we were getting a drink at bar waiting for dinner table. The girl sat beside me  ordered a very \"good looking\" appetizer which made me n my friend lock our eyes on it for quite some time. Its some sort of baked garlic bread thingy cut into long sticks came with big bowl of warm 3 cheese spinach dipping, topped with finely chopped green onion and I could smell a lot of garlic. The bread sticks looked soft and puffy, unlike those thing flat bread at most restaurants. We ordered that when we got to our table, it was the best bread with dip ever!! For $10.99 it was well worth it!   I had seafood linguine, and my friend had the burger. They both turn out excellent. The waitress was so sweet, she didnt just come over to ask me if I was done so she could take the plate away. She was watching me to see if I was really done with my food towards the end. One point she was walking over but realized I wasnt finished, she went back n waited. Also she came to our table to refill water number of times before our glasses were half empty. We gave her a very nice tip, I think she was very well deserved. She barely had any conversation with us, but she was truly paying attention on what we needed throughout the whole dinner. We never had to ask for anything over 2 hours, she knew what we wanted before we ask. I think she was smart =D I told her she was very beautiful before we left just to make her night."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite chain restaurant. Unfortunately, they got rid of the Parpadelle pasta and the spicy shrimp pesto pizza. Still trying to find a dish to compare to those from the older menu! (Please bring them back!)  I tried the swordfish tacos- they were pretty good with all the flavors but an extremely small portion as you only get two."}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with Earls. I used to love it back in the 80's and early 90's when it was more casual and had a fun atmosphere. Then in the last 15 years or so I just haven't really been a fan. Their menu is ok but it's a little overpriced for what it is.  This last trip was no different. The restaurant itself is nice. Great atmosphere, it's cozy, and not too loud. The staff were very attentive and came by regularly to make sure we were doing ok. I went with The Bronx Burger. It's basically a cheese burger with onion rings on it and some aioli. The patty was overcooked yet stayed moist and juicy on the inside which was the only saving grace as the meat was bland. The other ingredients on the burger gave some little bursts of flabout but for the msot part the whole thing fell flat. The caesar salad I got with it as a side was good, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Earls has completely redone their Stephen Ave/Bankers Hall location and its beautiful!  It's a similar layout as before but with some great changes. The biggest one is that they've changed the kitchen to add some \"grill-side\" seating. The new menu offers different skewers of meat and if you want, you can sit right up front and watch the action.  The menu here is almost completely different than other Earls restaurants. They've kept some of the favourites like the ribs, burgers, and the kung pao, but changed up their appetizers, salads and mains pretty significantly.  One other big change this location is trying out that you won't find at other locations is that there is a \"no tipping\" policy. The staff are paid a higher hourly wage which covers everyone from the front of house to the dishwasher in the back. We were actually encouraged by our server not to tip even though we thought the staff deserved a little extra.  For our dinner, my wife and I started off with each trying out their new boozy beverage called the Swizzle 67. Its fruity and spicy (flavour, not heat) and served in a tall glass with lots of crushed ice to cool you down. The appetizer we chose was the tomato salsa. Think of this dish as more of a relish than a traditional salsa. Its made with sun-dried tomatoes so its nice and salty and there's a layer of guac underneath to add some creaminess. The best part about this dish is that its carb free. Instead of tortilla chips, they give you wedges of jicama to scoop with.  For my main I chose the skirt steak and my wife went with the flatbread. The flatbreat was tasty, pretty standard fair. The skirt steak was excellent. The rub/marinade on the steak was very flavourful and it was served with roasted potatoes.   In addition to the swizzle I also gave some beers a try. They were having some problems with their taps so I told the server to just surprise me both times I ordered. The first beer was Alley Kat's Main Squeeze. Sour and refreshing. The other was their house seasonal the Rhino Seasonal Wheat. It was delicious with some slightly fruity notes and just a bite of hops on the finish.  For dessert I had the strawberry cheesecake and my wife the cookies and cream. The cheesecake was relatively straight-forward and was doused in strawberry sauce. it came served with a wafer that was almost better than the cake itself. The cookies and cream was interesting. It's chocolate ice cream paired with what looks like a doughnut. When you spoon into the \"doughnut\" you find that its actually vanilla pudding that's been dusted with a chocolate cookie powder.  Overall it was a great night and I look forward to going back to try out their many other new menu items."}
{"text":"After a few visits here, things seems to be getting better with each visit.   On my first visit I had the mushroom steak. It was meh and so was the service. The manager even came around to ask how everything was. When I told her how disappointed I was with the steak she did nothing other than to explain that the staff were being trained to better cook steaks \"next week\". Next week?! What about my steak tonight? Mojitos were on special that night so that was about the only thing that made up for the bad food. Though they don't muddle the mint enough in their mojitos.  My second visit involved the Dominical Fish Tacos. They were a little better than average and much better than the steak on my first visit. Again, it was mojito night. Still no muddling.  My visit last night was quite impressive. I tried the crispy chicken with avocado & tomatillo sauce. It was excellent. I couldn't believe that this dish had come out of an Earls. The skin on the chicken was perfectly crisp, the avocado sauce had great flavour, and the roasted veggies were done to perfection. My only complaint about the meal was the tortilla soup. It was good, but I've had much better.  If things continue to improve then I might have to make my visits a little more regular."}
{"text":"A good spot for drinks with friends, but the food is just mediocre. I had the chicken, brie + fig sandwich, which was actually quite good but it was easily something I could make at home. I ordered the coconut cake for dessert, expecting a fluffy flour-based cake. However it was actually a tart made from shredded coconut. Which would have been okay, had my tart not been overcooked and impossible to cut let alone eat."}
{"text":"It was very good. Our server, Christin, was very pleasant and accommodating. But, except for some basic salads, there are NO vegan options on the menu, which in 2016, is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Pretty good food! Tasty salads and a good cajun chicken. The bottles of wine are a bit pricey ($50 for a Inniskillin pinot grigio) but if you can manage to get a table it's a fun time. Last time I was there some crazy drunk guy with a his tie around his head was dancing around and buying everyone shots of Patron- I managed to get 2 out of it!  I found the guys weren't really in pick up mode. They usually stand around and drink amongst themselves although we did meet a couple tables of guys. Anyway it's a great after work spot but if you want to get in Wednesdays or Thursdays be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Been here about 3x.  Always had a great experience.  Went in last night around 6pm on Wednesday Jan 17th.  Very attentive staff.  Really nice Manager (wish I got his name) came over to our table to see if all was good. He was very professional and well dressed. Hostess accommodating moving from a table to the booth.  Waitress and other servers were all very friendly.  Waitress Kirsten was awesome. Great experience, well run, friendly staff.  Good food.  Thanks for a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Like a poor man's Milestone - not worth your time. And boy, did it ever take a long time to get our food and service as not good. The restaurant wasn't busy in the mid-afternoon on a Saturday. And yet, it took us nearly an hour for service and for the food to arrive.  The food was fine, but not worth the time..."}
{"text":"We walked by Earl's while looking for some place for an after dinner drink... I got sucked in when I saw the patios with comfy seatings and the heat lamps.... I ran in so fast and so my fellow yelpers don't have a chance to change their mind!!   Friendly hostess asked inside or out? I screamed OUTSIDE... so apparently outside is first come first serve.   Drinks Specials everyday.. Tuesday Bellini special.. Bellini please and even the guys ended up drinking one of those....   Good friends, good conservations, cheap drinks and cool patios.........   Life is good!   It helps when our waitress was pretty, witty and quick!! She gave us a split bill without us requesting!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why the music is so loud here.   Wednesday night this Earl's is almost empty... most of the patrons here were watching MLB playoffs. All these guys hanging out with guys.   Maybe just an excuse for me to YELL at my Yelp Friend?! Or he just pretended that he cannot hear me...even I am yelling right into his face.  $5.50 a pint for Albino Rhino is decent, cold and refreshing.   $3 off one pound of chicken wings on Wednesday but since it is on special, no raw veggie on the side. At first I thought the kitchen forgot, but apparently that's not the case. Talking about being cheap for a business of this size and price point? How much does those celery and carrot stick cost?   Services was definitely show and indifferent. With no one greeted me or taking my orders for quite awhile... until the nice bartender hopped over to my table and take my order.  Probably won't be back! I do love Downtown's location with its huge patio, This location has nothing much to offer."}
{"text":"Excellent service, good food, and a great atmosphere--with accessible prices, particularly given the location.  The jeera chicken curry is a winner."}
{"text":"Very juicy steak. Great dessert as well. $71 CAD which is about $50 USD. I feel like we robbed the place. Easily $100 USD in New York. It is worth the trip if you are from the states just to come to this restaurant. Amazing atmosphere and great food. It doesn't get any better than this."}
{"text":"As a native of Vancouver I am well-versed in Earls (where there are tonnes of them). Typically boasting some of the prettiest servers and decent food, they are continually packed. I expected the same from the King Street address, but was happily surprised with the food in addition to the \"scenery\". The fish & chips which I ordered was extremely good. I will definitely return more often considering the fact that they have a decent patio and good food.   On the downside, the service when we went there was far below average. The girls were standing in a group talking rather than serving the people on the patio. I mean a good 6 or 7 or them standing there for a good 4 or 5 minutes at a time... pretty ridiculous if you ask me... lunch service is better than weekend service."}
{"text":"Well hello from very south lol!! Dropped in earls with My hunny after getting car things done nearby. We come here again now that they serve Canadian beef, although we didn't order any haha! Had the new Korean wings extra crispy which were AMAZEBALLS, regular hot were good, leroys ribs good, mini happy hour meat pizza very good. Our Caesar salad was not up to earls standards nor ours so it was promptly sent back and replaced with a beautifully done classic Earls Caesar salad by the chef....which we ate enthusiastically (salad not chef). Tavin was our server and he took very good care of us he was a wonderful server! All in all a great experience."}
{"text":"This was my second time coming to Earls. This time, it was for a work function during lunch time. We came just before 12 PM, and I was pretty surprised at how packed the place was. We had a reservation for a large group though, so we were seated no problem at a large table in the middle of the dining area. Despite it being busy though, it wasn't too loud, and we were still able to enjoy conversation at our table.  The food at Earls is pretty standard Canadian food: lots of sandwiches, burgers, pasta, but also some interesting fusion type dishes like curry or Thai vegetable bowl. I ordered off their feature menu this time, and got salmon which came with corn, fennel and potatos ($25). It was verrrrry delicious, and I loved how the skin on the salmon was crispy. All the flavours on my dish mixed really well together, so I thoroughly enjoyed it.   I have read other reviews complaining about poor service, but the service we experienced was great. Our waiter was attentive and came by to take our orders, refill our water and clear our plates in a timely manner. No complaints from me. The last time I came here (in February), I don't think I had any issues with the service either."}
{"text":"The calamari, the pasta alfredo and the royal burger was a little salty. Hopefully they make their food less salty after reading my review! :P  On a positive note, the tuna tostadas was great! But it won't fill you up since it's an appetizer."}
{"text":"The patio is decorated nicely and the heaters are effective (compared to other patios I've been to) however two annoyances were the slow service and the lack of cleanliness. My girlfriend ordered lemon water and her glass had a lipstick mark on it. She sent it back and got the same glass, STILL with lipstick marks on it. I let her have some of my beer instead because it wasn't worth the fuss. The food was good, but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Went Friday night after work around 10pm and had to wait 45min for a table. We were told the bar was \"first come first serve\" and was so packed there was no point of even trying so we waited to sit in the lounge. My date did not like where we were seated..  I didn't mind..it was a window seat with big comfy chairs!  We had a couple drinks and ordered chicken wings for a snack. They were very small.  So small it looked like chic's wings...not chicken wings.  I was told that Thursday nights are best time to go and that it gets busy at 10 and to go early... so we shall see!"}
{"text":"This place is a kind of classy place inside Square One, which is nice and convenient. Unfortunately, the food here is disappointing. I got the fish and chips, and while the coleslaw was good and the fries were okay, they made the fish waaaaay too salty. It kind of ruined an otherwise good dish that was well-battered. It reminded of the burger I got here a few years back, which was also way too salty. I wasn't sure if the chef just got the shaky hands that day, but I'm decently sure it's a permanent condition at this point. I'm very pro-salt too, but for whatever reason this restaurant just uses way too much of it."}
{"text":"Oh 16th Avenue Earl's how you raised me, fed me, called me your own.  Remember the time me and Lise would come and drink coffee for hours with Ashley the waiter who was a man, I do.   These were the green and white stripe days, when I was 16, you left me with such a love in my heart that when I turned 18 and wasn't really sure what to do after high school, I found myself at 17th Avenue Earl's, your second cousin, Radisson Heights Earl's.  Of course my love for Earl's only grew each day making friends first as a hostess then as a waitress, party planner and even comedy writer for events we had.  What an amazing experience it was to work with Al and Mo Jessa in the kitchen, and Jerry Parker as my manager. I made friends with Justine, Fire-Katt, The Kid, Rick DeRossa, Anita, JV Finlayson, Danny, Spy, Veronica, Bruce Poontip and an old fave Eeeeeen Ball! Here's something for you if you find this Een, \"It twirled UP!\"  In training at Earl's they actually make you take a test and you have to know the food REALLY well. You have to know that the chicken tenders use Japanese Panko breading and there is orange rind in the plum sauce.   Tip money sent me to Jamaica, and Mexico and all other kinds of trouble.  It used to be that each year Earl's would send their kitchen managers and general managers on a trip around the world. They would go and taste wines, and try new recipes and come back with a new dish and a lot of amazing ways to make the menu EVEN better.  This is where Nasi Goreng came from, and interesting new ingredients to create that fresh amazing taste that Earl's is known for. When they say \"Fresh food up\", that means, no freezer except for the frozen pie.  I ended up being transferred to Lethbridge Earls during college, and then when I got back and was looking for work in Journalism Earls' was there for me again up at West-Hills.  Years ago I moved to San Diego where there is NO Earls sadly and for years I've been in a professional setting testing software and websites, but I still JONES for Earl's food.   A little while ago I drove out to Arizona and found and Earl's in Scottsdale, near Phoenix, mmmmmmmm I love it there, I had one of my old FAVES, pork dry ribs (with course salt and pepper) and their amazing clam chowder soup.   Dude, Earl's does a body good :)  I can't say enough good things about my experiences and fun and friends I met working at Earl's. It was my entrance to the restaurant world but not just that, an eye opening fun way to learn about food, presentation and international flavors that are FRESH!"}
{"text":"Food is just \"meh\" compared to other restaurants in the area ( this is near Colossus, so there are several in the area). There is nothing outstanding that would keep bringing me back.  Staff is attentive, food quality is good, food arrives hot, is tasty....but I can get that almost anywhere (well,not really....but there are some places that are good).  As this is close to Colossus,  a Costco, other restaurants, traffic can be a bit of a challenge. Plus it is very noisy on the inside.  Have been here twice in the last 6 months....never disappointed...just want to try new places"}
{"text":"I went here because it was convenient and it was inside the mall, I wanted to dine in but didn't want to travel so far.  First off, the portions are WAY TOO SMALL. I don't even eat that much but the portions are way too small. I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo for 13$, it's a pretty steep price for how much they give you. My friend ordered the chicken tacos and he hated it. But he also looked over at my plate and gawked at how little pasta they gave me. I have to say it was damn delicious though, probably the best fettuccine alfredo I ever tasted!  However, the place looks pretty fancy and our waiter was incredibly nice. He gave my friend a drink refill without even asking! I've never seen that happen before, sadly.  Overall, I think this place is too overpriced for the portions they give you, but our waiter was incredibly nice and the decor looked pretty fancy. I would have rather went to the food court to be honest though, it would guarantee a full stomach. Meh."}
{"text":"Is it true that when applying for a serving position at Earls you are required to provide a picture along with your resume?  It wouldn't surprise me as this is one of the more pretentious places I've ever been to.  Not only are all the waitresses somewhat stuck-up, but they seem to portray an attitude that they are better than you.  When asked if a cab could be called for our party, the hostess very grudgingly picked up the phone, dialed the number, but neglected to tell us the cab was there... we missed it.  It also seems that they don't so much care about good customer service as they do about looking good for the customers.  I was trying to get the attention of our waitress but she was busy checking her make-up in the mirror and flirting with the bartender.  Needless to say, our drinks were expensive and the appetizers weren't good enough to send me back again.  It's a little too (fake) fancy for my liking."}
{"text":"Went here for a few drinks after getting dinner nearby and came away really impressed.Lots of great beer choices, some good scotch too, good service at the huge bar, and really open space - easy to hear everyone you're talking to.  Have heard you'll never get a seat if you get here right after work - but can't comment on that."}
{"text":"I've been here before a few times and have not had any issues. However, I made reservations for lunch here over a week ago and called to confirm yesterday. Apparently my first request was not added so luckily they were able to \"add\" in a reservation for me (10 adults + 3 babies requiring high chairs). My party arrived and there was confusion with my reservation, first they did not have my reservation on their system (even though I called twice and confirmed!) and second they did NOT have high chairs. I am thoroughly disappointed with the service here. Also, a waitress knocked my sister in the head hard with a tray of food without any compensation for it. The food here is okay, a little overpriced, but otherwise the service was poor and I will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"Managmet was horrible at this place! To make this review quick me and my boyfriend went Saturday night and orderd the peppercorn steak, and the bugure with the onion ring. The food had flavour no dought and I know what happened next wasn't done on purpose, we did find a hair inside the onion ring. Yes inside the onion ring!!! My boyfriend wanted to we'll vomit because it was in his mouth. I know so we called the. Manager over and his first reaction was. OK let me take this to back. And get you a new one typical good Managmet you think. Untill he came back and said the hair inside was mine. :s I have red hair the hair inside the onion ring is blong :s honestly what it all come down to Managmet sucks!!!! N when we wanted to leave we asked him for the bill and he said ok that's fine and we saw him walk to the other side of the bar sit down and started to eat. 5 min later gets up prints our bill and brings it to us. Don't go here this location is horrible!!!"}
{"text":"I live across the street from this location and frequent it often - I do hope they see this review as the last two times I've eaten there I have decided to not return. The staff are too busy huddled together socializing rather than providing basic customer service. On several occasions now I'm left sitting for an entire meal without getting a water refill. The last time I ordered a medium steak I got a rare piece of bloody steak still mooing- when I complained they said no problem, and brought me another one . Even more rare than the first. I thought this was some kind of sick joke. Last night, it took 20 Minutes to be provided a menu.  I'll be bringing my money else where and I suggest you do to."}
{"text":"Decided to go downtown last minute last Friday and ended up here at this place. I have never eaten at an Earls before but hear it was pretty good. When we arrived we saw the place was rammed.. not really into the mood to wait we decided to pull up on some stools next to the bar. A few minuted later I noticed a few tables opening up deeper into the bar next to some windows. We decided to move over there to make the evening conversation a little more enjoyable by sitting across instead of one straight line at the bar. My first drink was the Bellini, great slushy drink with typical flavours you would find else where offering the same drink. For my main I decided on the Los Cabos Chicken Tacos which was stuffed with spiced tomato poached chicken, melted cheddar and jalapeno jack cheese, avocado corn salsa,  chopped cilantro, salsa picante, white corn tortillas. I decided on the regular side order of fries nothing to fancy. It was tasty and the 2 sauces it came with were mild and spicy. I enjoy anything with good wholesome/traditional flavours and I feel this meal is a great choice to offer on the menu. I then decided on the a glass of house wine, I didn't feel it satisfying my tastes buds very much. Actually in fact I didn't enjoy the glass at all and didn't end up finishing it.   The atmosphere seems to be modern, low key but classy. A lot of people in the bar seemed to be dressed to the nines (not sure if its because of the place or because it was downtown). Either way it was a great time with the right company."}
{"text":"I was here before for happy hour during the summer and I enjoyed the fish tacos there. My previous review is online. I came back some time before Christmas during happy and ordered the same thing. 2 fish tacos and a white sangria pitcher to share. I think the prices of the fish tacos went up (2 for $12 now). It's completely different then the summer menu. This time around there's no deep fried batter to it and I'm not sure if a different fish is used. They came out all dark which we thought was a piece of chicken LOL but it was the fish. The tortilla wraps were crispy and prior they were soft.  I prefer the summer happy hour menu. Maybe it's just the seasonal transition?   Service was great like usual."}
{"text":"It is a little bit more formal restaurant with a bar inside and a outside patio area.  We continue to go back there because we really enjoy the food. Especially some of the specials will continue to change over time. The second time we went there we had two new dishes. Both of them were great!  Definitely will come back here again.  It is inside of the square one so parking it is very convenient."}
{"text":"Good food, got the avocado smash, dynamite roll, and a couple swordfish tacos to share. Our server  suggested the smashed avocado, and was a great addition to our choices."}
{"text":"Worst service. It's rude to not check on your table after they order drinks. I'm pretty sure the waitress gave us menus so we could order food? No? Or maybe she was too busy with the guys wearing suits? Clearly you were walking past our table and when we try to grab your attention you just pretend like you didn't see us.  If you don't have a penis, your service won't be as good. I didn't realize this restaurant only caters to men. Sorry, let me fix that.. Mainly men in suits. The douche bags of the financial district.   So after 20 minutes you come to check up on us, great! Thank you SO much.   I don't understand how some of these girls get these jobs with their lack of customer service skills."}
{"text":"Earl's is a chain of West Coast restaurants featuring upscale, but casual, dining. I'd say they're a step or two above Friday's or Tuesday's or Chili's. They still have fancy food menus with lots of colorful pictures and table-top menus with expensive (and specials that aren't as expensive) drinks. Interesting and creative entrees and nibbles.  I was wandering in the downtown area and Earl's seemed to catch my eye. And looking at the menus, the Tuna Poke Nachos looked bright and colorful and really delicious. So I asked the waitress (they're all really young and really pretty) to bring me one of \"those\" and a draft beer. A full 20 ounce pint was what I was expecting but as an American, that's a whole lot of beer. I'm glad I wasn't driving! The nachos arrived and they were just like in the menu. Maybe less tuna than I expected, but still a lot of flavor and spiciness.   No problem with rude or inattentive waitress, Aurora (real name?) was at my table when I needed her and not there when I didn't need her.  Decent food, decent drinks, reasonable prices. Free wifi. It was a three-star experience - A-OK."}
{"text":"Went for a post-jays game meal at Earl's. About a 10 min walk from the Roger's Centre, Earl's Kitchen & Bar serves high quality (American? or Canadian?) fare. The dim lit establishment lined with glossy wood reminds me of Houston's or Hillstone in the states.   Now to the food - The burgers are what they are known for. Make sure you bring a large appetite or a friend to take one of their meaty burgers down. This might be a Canada thing but the burgers are served with mayo, sans ketchup. The bun was really soft and overall the burger was really good. We also shared the full rack of ribs with cole slaw. Like what others said, the meat falls off the bone and was highly enjoyable. The slaw was a bit heavy on the mayo.   Overall, I think Earl's is a nice restaurant for any occasion - date, friends, family."}
{"text":"Beautiful wait staff, great patio bar, and good food. Great for casual / business meetings anytime of day; and leads well right into happy hour for the evening.  First time in Toronto this week and I landed at the right bar."}
{"text":"Overall (3/5) - The food is taste but expensive for what it is. The servers are nice but usually quite slow, especially when it comes to following up with you. I'd recommend coming here if you just need a safe/normal place to go but don't come here expecting to have anything out of the ordinary.   ______________________  Wait (5/5) - They have a lot of seating and I've never had to wait, no matter what time of day I go.  Ambience (4/5) - The place looks very nice and modern but is also a bit louder than I'd expect a restaurant to be.  Service (3/5) - The servers and staff are quite nice but don't come around often enough and overall service is usually slow (possibly due to the kitchen being slow).  Food (3/5) - It's your average North American food (with a combination of some fusion items). Nothing out of the ordinary but definitely a safe bet.  Price (3/5) - Pricey for what it is but nothing people can't afford."}
{"text":"Great, family friendly restaurant with fresh, flavourable foods. Earls has always been my favourite chain restaurant because you know you will get quality food. I'm happy they changed their policies to serve Canadian meats rather than the American ones. It's nice to see they listened to their community."}
{"text":"Came in here after dropping off my luggage with a recommendation from my hotel. While I liked the decor a bit, can't say I was that impressed with the meals.   The famous clam chowder was a great portion size but some things were off. Too soupey, for starters. Should have a thicker texture to be \"chowder\". Additionally, there was a garnish on it that overpowered the taste. It's like 20% garnish. Lastly, unevenly cooked potatoes. Eeeeh. Just think you could have a Campbell's can that is more consistent.   The Kung pow chicken noodles was good. The noodles were tasty. And again, you could feed 3 with this single dish.   The staff was a little spaced out. Maybe because it was Sunday night... Or it's just the way they are.... Who knows."}
{"text":"My husband and I go to this Earl's fairly regularly as it's good and is one of the better places within walking distance of our house.   The interior is modern, but still cozy and they have a nice patio. They also seem to play pretty good music here, which is a nice bonus for me.  I enjoy the food here a lot. I'm horribly picky and have trouble eating out a lot, most places are just too weird or overdone. Earls definitely has some of those sorts of things, but they have a number of things that I like to eat. It's also quite consistent, I can't really think of a time where the food was bad.  The service can be spotty at times, especially if they are really busy. However that's not the norm and the staff are usually pleasant and efficient. I will also say that a number of the wait staff are quite fashionable too, which I think adds to the nice atmosphere.  All in all it's a nice place to go grab a bite to eat and we will certainly keep coming back."}
{"text":"After not getting a chance to come to this place in Vancouver, decided it was time to head hear in Toronto.  The atmosphere is very nice, and the decor is nice as well, almost bar meets lounge meets restaurant vibe.  The service was pretty bad, and our table was ignored about 90% of the time we were there, and same thing occurred when we moved to the bar area after dinner. We were even ignored after getting the bill, which took us 20 minutes to pay. While the waitresses were all very attractive (the gimmick if I am not mistaken) , I don't by into these gimmicks and would prefer no small talk or fake flirting and prefer just good genuine service instead.  The food was very good overall.  The steaks were all cooked perfectly and the vegetables and goat cheese salad on the side were well seasoned and made me glad that I didn't get potatoes. All of the people with me said there food was good as well.  They seem to have a nice variety of various foods, from Pizza, to Meat, to Fish to Asian Fusion, so definitely a good place for groups.  The atmosphere and nice variety of food choices make up for the lack of service. As I am not from Toronto seems like a consistent spot to head to when I don't know what I want to do when I am up here."}
{"text":"All sections of this restaurant have a great, fun, light-hearted atmosphere, with great smiles all around and excellent smells floating in the air.  I always get the Grilled Chicken and Baked Brie Ciabatta because the combination of the baked brie and the fig jam makes this sandwich what it is - wickedawesome.  So make sure if you get it, that you can taste both ingredients.    I've been to this place several times and have always had a good time, either sitting at the lounge, the bar, or the dining room.  Service has always been amazing, even when we celebrated a family member's birthday here and sat at the bar.  The bartenders were friendly and paid close attention to how you wanted you have your drink made and they turned out delicious every time. Mondays is Margarita Monday and they are really good too, in a variety of flavours including lime, mango, and something else....hm....  The bathroom door is greatly decorated with a Superman figure, which just makes this place even more amazing.  Downfall: the restaurant faces the mall on its east side and sometimes seeing people shopping is not very appetizing, but that may be me because I don't like feeling like I'm in a fish bowl.  The only thing that I would not recommend is the pad thai but I'm not even sure if they still serve it, and might have likely just been an isolated event since everything else I've tried here has always tasted amazing.    I also recommend the Prawn Dynamite Roll, if you are a sushi fan.  Great place, great atmosphere. Superman at the bathroom dooor, awesome."}
{"text":"Great spot!   As always the food is superb and drinks very nice.   Pricing is reasonable.  Service is very strong!   Nice quiet downtown Toronto restaurant.    Will definitely come by again."}
{"text":"It was dinner rush and they got us in 5 mins, our waitress was really friendly. Had the Mediterranean linguine it was really flavorful, also the Bigger Better Burger was really juicy."}
{"text":"Being from Vancouver it was nice to see Earls start to make a foot print in Toronto. We will start to visit it more and more. The food is delicious and the ambiance reminds me of a up scale jack actors.  I've had Asian, Pasta and most recently a 10oz steak. The food never disappoints and the customer service is top notch. It doesn't come with a bit of an expensive price tag but for the quality of food you get and the portions. I can't complain!  Only draw back is there only a few locations around the city to enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great ambience. Not pretentious but trendy and chic. Had the steal and coconut shrimp. Perfect.  Great for a conversation"}
{"text":"During a recent memorial Day (US) trip to Toronto, while waiting to attend a performance at The Princess of Wales Theatre on Kings Street, came across this gem of a place. Huge inside but elected to try the outdoor seating - impressed by the adjustable roof shades. The spot is on the ground floor of the SunLife tower in the heart of the financial district in downtown Toronto. Definitely the casual dining spot, but elegant service, they were prompt in seating us and patiently answered all of my questions. We chose 3 appetizers: we tried the Dynamite Roll:  prawn, mango + avocado sushi. It had a side sriracha mayonnaise for spice, sprinkle of black sesame + unagi maple sauce, I particularly liked the Chilli Chicken+Wontons and the third appetizer we liked was the 3 cheese+spinach+artichoke dip with crumbled feta on top and flat-bread. For the main course I ordered the Hunan Kung Pao with chicken and my friend had the Cajun Chicken Cheddar sandwich. Lots of food,so I ventured washing it down with a Cucumber Mule, not bad at all!"}
{"text":"Have been to this location a few times. Always enjoyed the atmosphere, food and service. Recently came here with a group of four; for drinks we started with a pitcher of sangria, tiki torch and a beer. For food we had 2 steak + sushi dishes, peppercorn steak and the fish tacos. We also got a cheesecake for dessert(but you can tell this was thawing). Everything was great, our server Laura D. made our night even more enjoyable. Despite it being busy, she was very attentive, never had to call her over as she always topping up our water and making sure we were fine. Some servers have attitudes when it gets busy(or not) but she was great! Thanks for the great service, Laura!"}
{"text":"Good service but average apps!      Stopped in to share some apps with a friend pre-show at the Jubilee.  The apps were average at best.  My favourite was probably the calamari and least the artichoke dip .  The truffle fries were fine but waaaay over priced.  The margarita pizza way good not great."}
{"text":"Its been years since I've been to this Earls location, but a meeting had me right in this area which warranted a long over due reunion.  I have to say Earls new facelift is not too shabby at all, rich finishings and a sleek contemporary design is a welcome change to the old open space with tables out in the open as they once had back in the day.  I love the cozy feel of the booths that are now abundant and the menu although completely revamped had an old friend back on it that I longed for, the Hunan kung pao is back kids.  I was in heaven, although I am cutting back on gluten I had to have this, it took me back to my days in college where we would frequent Earls for their famous wings happy hour and shoving our face in a bowl of 4 chili hunan kung pao (you can actually choose how spicy you want it, and choose the amount of whole chilies they add to your dish!).  It was a little different than I remember but still just as satisfying with the option of chicken, shrimp and a welcome addition of tofu for our veggie friends (I had the chicken but will be trying the tofu next time)  I have since gone back for dinner with the family and had the blackened cajun chicken with the most divine warm potato salad; and let me say I was skeptical of this warm salad and really wanted to opt it out for some veg but our waitress coaxed me into trying it and she guaranteed me that there had not been one person she waited on that tried it and did not like it-SOLD.  OMG it was amazing, I had daydreams about this warm potato salad, I even attempted to make a replica of this salad but it was no where as good as Earls.  I have been back twice in one week just for that salad.  My only complaint is there isn't enough of it with the meal.  I mean my husband started to tuck into it and he hates potato salad.    Almost every time I do dine out, I can gauge how good the meal is going to be by having a cocktail. I ordered the Caesar and it was perfect.  If you can make this drink for me and I don't have a single issue with it, you got me.  There was a beef jerky garnish, and something pickled if I recall correctly but I was just so impressed with it, that I ordered another.  That aside, Earls has won a place back in my heart after a short separation- and to find out that my husband has had several lunch work \"meetings\" in the area as well speaks volumes about the quality of food and he is a tough critic, once he's turned off on a place, rarely will he return!   Earls if you won my husband back you definitely got me back too.  Although you absolutely deserve a 5 I will only give it to you once you bring back the dish thats up there with the Hunan kung pao and that is the GRILLATO CHICKEN.  Those who know this dish know what I am talking about, amirite?  That dish was an institution to hard core Earls patrons in the 90's and early  2000's, remember the Albino Rhino ale?  Good lord I'm getting old.  Either way, this one is a winner and will always go back there when stuck with the question of where to go out to eat.    Wish there was one closer to the Country Hills/Panorama area as I would be there weekly.   Thinking of starting a petition to bring back Grillato Chicken, anyone with me? hello? anyone?"}
{"text":"I am quite torn with this review.  I guess I can honestly say it is hit or miss with Earls, not particularly this location.  I had the pleasure of dining here for a Christmas party and everything was fantastic, I don't know if it was because it was a party or that night was slow or if the server was a gem but everything was great, the food, wine, dessert and service, who knows maybe I was a bit drunk but I really had a fab time.  Next time I went was on a Sunday with the man, just us two.  I don't know how and why but during that evening management managed to have all the ignoramuses working the same shift.  The host was this young blond petite thing who walked around like she owned the place, here is a bit of advice, even if you own the place you don't act like a prick.  It really doesn't get you far, especially with customers who are business owners as well and know the game.  Our server.  WOW.  This piece of work still provides me and my friends countless hours of entertainment, she always wins in the \"worst waitress ever\" category.  She took 20 minutes to get our drink order, which she screwed up, and forgot the cutlery for my husbands soup and salad.  Took her or the kitchen 1 hour to get our meal and the restaurant was DEAD.  Also managed to screw up my husbands steak.  Again, did not bring a steak knife, I guess we should have used our butter knife but hey, who would have known?  And finally the peice de resistance, I asked for a lemon wedge for my cocktail and she brought it on a tray and placed it on the table without a plate using her bare hands. Oh ya, and she was totally macking on one of the bus boys all night instead of checking up on us and our lack of cutlery.  The said bus boy was macking on the bar staff instead of clearing up tables; note to bar staff, try to keep your hooters in your tube top at all times, I really don't need to see anymore rolls, be it in bread form or other.  When we asked to speak to a manager regarding said incompetence, he was great and really apologetic and comped the steak, accordingly.    We have not been back since, but did go to the Tin Palace location, it was great but what ticks me off is that almost everything is priced $1 more for entr√©es, salads, and deserts AND you have to pay for parking which they add to your bill.  So Stupid!  In short, it could go either way but make no mistake about it, do have the cheesecake with blueberry compote for desert, at $8 it better be good!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my birthday. I had made resos online through open table, Earls called me a couple days ahead to confirm. Prior to arriving, I called in to push the time back a little and was able to move my party back an hour with no problems.   We had Anthony as our server. Great guy. Knowledgable and attentive, he knew all the answers we asked him and checked back with us every 5-10 mins.   Regarding the food it was great. We tried the Sicilian calamari and chilli chicken with wontons. Both were tasty, hot and fresh. No complaints whatsoever.   On to the meal itself I got the 8 oz steak with prawns. Prawns were an upgrade but I received literally 10, which was a lot for me. My meal also came with mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables. Also great. Only complaint was the beets, not a big fan. Anthony made sure to get them replaced free of charge with something else. Everyone else enjoyed there meals as well, Bronx burger looked amazing. Kale salad was good as well.   Highlight of the night came when the manager came by our table. She acknowledged that since it was my birthday and I didn't really like beets, the entire meal for me would be comped. Now, I didn't complain at all. I simply asked for them to be replaced with another vegetable. Which had already been done by Anthony. But she insisted I take the free meal. I literally tried to say no. Three times. But she insisted.   Overall great experience. Anthony was a great server, management surpassed my expectations for a chain restaurant, everyone enjoyed there food and drinks and price wise, it was not bad at all.   I will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"This is a high end restaurant. The price not so, but the environment definitely. I yesterday my friend and I came here to get drunk, and I could not believe how nice this place is.     In the heart of downtown business area, the decoration makes you feel simultaneously like a city dweller and a dream walker. There's no dress code involved - I was wearing a top brand suit but my friend was wearing a t-shirt. (Cold but meh) Our waitress was mega friendly (and cute) and she cared about the reason my friend wanted to get drunk. And the cocktails are surprisingly not costly. I had to take care of my friend so I had some non-alcoholic cocktails and guess what - they are good as the real ones (and healthier, yay) Money well spent! I'll definitely come back more often."}
{"text":"This was a surprise find in dt Toronto, on a business trip some co workers stumbled upon it.  Decor is very high end and waitresses are legit.  Everyone in our party ordered burgers, I ordered the one with onion rings. The burger was huge. Huge meaning u had to take out some onion rings ad cut the burger in half to be able to eat it. Would recommend the burger but not the sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries were blah, to say the least. Oh the place is overly loud during evenings so having a conversation can be tough."}
{"text":"IT WAS OK.  Went here with a couple of girlfriends on a Friday night. Luckily we made a reservation a week before so our table was guaranteed. We came in 1/2 hr earlier and we only had to wait for 5 minutes to get our table set up. Not a bad start.  As soon as we settled in, we couldn't help but notice the loudness inside the restaurant. IT WAS VERY LOUD that we had to yell out our words to have a proper conversation. At the end of the night, one of the girls lost her voice. Uh oh.  We shared a pitcher of white sangria. It was alright. It's a pretty small pitcher and it didn't come with any fruits in it. Wait, it did. A few diced apples. SCORE. That costed us $20.  I ordered grilled chicken and baked brie sandwich with a side of fries. The sandwich was pretty good, I liked the sweet and savory blend. However, it's too oily. The fries were ok, tasted like McCain's fries. One friend ordered the chicken tacos. She said Joey's tacos were better :p The other friend ordered the chicken cajun sandwich. She didn't say much about her food so I guess it's neither here nor there.  Didn't order any appy or dessert, though I really wanted to try the s'mores! Perhaps another time...  Overall, it was an ok experience. Our waitress was ok, neither attentive nor ignorant (maybe a little snobbish? I got that vibe from her...) I'm going to try Joey's first before coming back to Earl's so I can make a proper comparison :)"}
{"text":"We decided to give Earls another try after management contacted me on my review.   The service was definitely a 180 from the last visit we had. Our server was friendly and attentive throughout our visit. We started off with wings as our app, I got a burger with fries, and he got the steak and sushi.  Food came to our table within a reasonable time and it all tasted delicious. We were really full by the end of dinner.   Earls definitely changed our opinion of them. Therefore, we will be returning in the near future."}
{"text":"What a disappointing experience. Wings were miss represented, flatbread was cold as was the spinach dip. There has to be better restaurants in Calvary."}
{"text":"It's usually quite busy here on the weekends but we went on a Thursday night and it wasn't very packed. I've tried their special promo 16oz ribeye steak this time and my date got the fish tacos. I liked both but the steak was a bit cold when it arrived.  The first time I came here though, they messed up my order and gave me the wrong pasta. I didn't mention anything because it was a Friday (it was really really busy) and I honestly didn't know I got the wrong one until my bf pointed it out to me after we wolfed down half already! At the end I asked them if this was actually the chicken mushroom fettuccini and they realized their mistake and gave me a whole new pasta to go! I didn't really care but the young waitress was really nice about it. Great service but the food is a hit or miss. The Mediterranean chicken pasta wasn't that great (too sour) but the chicken mushroom one was amazing. :)"}
{"text":"Earl's at Square One was the perfect venue for catching up with an old friend on a warm, Thursday evening. Lots of young, beautiful people, and very nice waitstaff.    As for the food -  they have an interesting take on Calamari - never had olives or yogurt sauce with Calamari before. The fries were decent, but the truffle mayo totally rocked - yum, I just wish they'd given us more! The house lager was good, and pretty cheap for a pitcher.   So I'm probably the only person in the GTA that had never been to Square One before, but be forewarned if you are using googlemaps to find this place - it is NOT where it says it is on the map. I finally had to flag down a parking guy to point me in the right direction after driving around the area that Maps was taking me for 15 minutes, and the restaurant was literally on the exact opposite side of the mall."}
{"text":"I've been to the Earls in Toronto and Mississauga and I've always enjoyed it. Food and service have always been decent and consistent.   The first time I went to the Vaughan location the service was lacking a bit. The second time..... the service was slow. We came to a practically empty restaurant. Other came after us and actually started to eat before us. We, unfortunately , had an hour wait. The server was apologetic and the manager handled the situation fairly. But I don't think I'll be returning any time soon. The food was good though!"}
{"text":"Very standard Earls - neither best of the chain, nor the worst. And the chain itself is a Canadian standard. Can work for business brunch, or a night with friends. Not something to crave, neither something to reject. Your national average is here...  And this particular location sports some really nice servers and rather cozy seating areas - good for groups! Food is standard, and not bad at it. Also standardly priced. Or overpriced, depending on your how picky you are. Think twenty bucks lunch... makes sense?  The only really negative for this location is parking. Like, seriously - there is none!!!!! Good luck leaving your car closer than two-three blocks away, as residential area there is plagued with \"permit only\" lanes and limited-time-special-day-only spots. Not good at all if you are driving in.  If not for the parking, that should have been a four-star review. Or at least 3.5 stars (thanks to the awesome servers, and kitchen work quality!)"}
{"text":"Pretty negative experience, unlike in other locations.  Service was beyond sloppy - forgetting who wanted what, slow, unable to coordinate arrival of the plates simultaneously. Polite, but rather unhelpful. And they tried to fix it, but still not quite successfully.  Food was okay - pretty standard Earl quality, average portions, and rather overpriced for what it is, but overall decent. Cocktails, nowhere near! No idea how is it possible to mess that up, but yes, level was on par with a cheap all-inclusive resort.  So not happy, and next time would not consider this location. Sorry."}
{"text":"Earl's is our go-to for Thursday/Friday nights with the coworkers as it is a building away from my work. The seafood linguini was great, they put breadcrumbs on top to give it a bit of a crunch. Really good. Not too salty, not bland, just right, with a big shrimp. Yum.  I had an appetizer that was really good too, it came with a dip of some sort, but i can't remember what it was. The pizzas aren't bad either. My coworkers said the burger's pretty good too. Good amount.  I normally sit in the area near the bar as i go there for drinks most of the time.  Washrooms are pretty clean. The place is pretty clean in general.  Waitresses are nice, although a bit slow. I go at busy times though, so I can see why. If you're going for afterwork drinks, I recommend coming before 5 p.m., especially on Thursdays and Fridays. It gets packed.  Never sat out in the patio, so I can't comment on that yet...  Overall, I think it's a great hangout spot with good food."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night for a late Dinner and the place was packed luckily I had made reservations! The patio here is absolutely gorgeous! I slightly regretted not getting a seat out there however the restaurant as an entirety is a gorgeous venue!  We were seated in the dining room in a cozy and comfy brown leather booth with a window view of the cooks working away in the kitchen behind us. The entire left side of the restaurant is lined with windows with views of the spectacular patio and king street. Wood ceiling, brick walls and dark wood tables paired with dim lighting add to the chic and happening atmosphere.  We start the night off with an appetizer from they always changing feature menu  Tuna Poke Nachos - crisp togarashi wontons, tuna, cucumber, avocado and tomato poke, spicy mango coulis, sliced serranos, crushed macadamia nuts Absolutely delicious! Tuna was fresh and the nachos covered all bases with good crunch, heat, and creaminess it was a great combo of flavors!  Mixed Field Greens - feta cheese, organic greens, julienne apples and candied pecans, apple cider vinaigrette Lightly dressed, fresh tasting, loved the cider dressing and crunchy candy pecans.  Naples Margherita Pizza - fresh mozzarella, parmesan, San Marzano tomato sauce, basil and extra virgin olive oil, hand tossed thin crust I didn't really have high expectation for this pizza but after the first bite I was pretty blown away. Super thin crust, delicious sauce and gooey cheese it was a fantastic tasting pizza!  Finally onto Dessert I knew instantly what I wanted!  Milk Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup - milk chocolate creme, peanut butter mousse, toffee crunch From the feature menu and as a PB lover I knew I had to try this! The dessert however was a little deceiving as it was more of a dense pudding than with the flavors of a peanut butter cup. However it still tasted divine and I ate every last drop, the crunchy large pieces of a toffee was a nice bonus.   Chocolate Sticky Toffee Pudding - warm rich chocolate cake, chocolate and toffee sauces, Mario's Gelati vanilla bean gelato The warm  fudgey cake paired with the cool creamy vanilla gelato also tasted great! I'm not a fan of toffee though as I find it too sweet so I could of done without that sauce.  Overall I have to say I had a really great evening. I love vibe and atmosphere of the restaurant and despite how busy it was our friendly male waiter always found to check on us and make sure everything was ok."}
{"text":"Summer time = Patio weather and that's what I was in the mood for. Thankfully Earl's has a lovely patio (not as pretty as the downtown location but far more convenient).  The hostess let us pick our table and informed us a waitress would be over to see us shortly. We chose a cozy grey marble top table in the back of the patio with cute little wicker back cushioned love seats in the uncovered part so we could bask in the sunshine.   After maybe a little too long of a wait a waitress finally approached us. She was friendly went over the menus and took our drink orders. I later noted her going to another table taking there drink orders and delivering there drink orders before ever returning to us.   She finally returned to us and did apologize for the wait and took our food orders... After spending far too long going over the menu I was set on ordering a burger as it also seemed like the most fitting fare dining on the patio.  Earls Bigger Better Burger - Certified Angus beef patty, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, mayonnaise and mustard on a house baked bun I have to admit it was a very beautiful looking burger presented a wooden cutting board made it look far more appetizing.....however it's looks sadly very deceiving  Bun - very dry....looked beautifully dark and shiny sprinkled with sesame seeds however it definitely seemed stale...not baked fresh in house..at least not today  Meat - Too overcooked and too thin of a patty for my liking. Flavour wise the meat itself was pretty bland except for the bit of flavour obtained from crust of light charring from being overcooked  Toppings - lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, mayonnaise and mustard...simple fitting traditional I suppose.. I asked for extra mustard and they definitely got that right  For my side I went with a salad which I far more enjoyed than the burger itself  Mixed Field Greens - feta cheese, organic greens, julienne apples, candied pecans, apple cider vinaigrette Very fresh tasting with a tangy light flavourful dressing loved the crunchy bits of green apple, creamy salty feta and the yummy candied pecans. A very refreshing and tasty salad indeed!  Overall I have to say the burger was highly disappointing as was the service. The patio was great to take in some sunshine however I think next time I'll stick to the downtown location."}
{"text":"Decent! 3.5 stars.   Food is quite decent and there is a large selection and variety of food from soft shell tacos, burgers, sushi, and even poke. I've been here on a few occasions and have left satisfied.   My favourite item off the menu is probably the garlic fries - the fries are very thinly cut and cooked to perfection, and they are served with a finely cut garlic paste(?) - amazing stuff. I've also tried the sushi, which is not bad - there isn't a wide variety of different rolls you can order (but you probably aren't here to order the sushi right?). The poke was interesting and was almost more like a ceviche - I would order this again."}
{"text":"Whenever my wife and i go out for a meal, we will usually end up at Earls.  Great food and excellent service.  I always have the Hunan Kung Pao.  It is excellent. The one time that my wife wasn't satisfied with part of her meal, the carrots weren't cooked, the waitress immediately made it right by removing all drinks from our bill."}
{"text":"I am a vegan and was amazed and thankful that I could actually have a menu item that worked for me which was not fries...or a green salad or pizza without the cheese!!  I looked for the V symbol on the menu and there were a handful...and then asked about fish sauce or chicken broth in items. I was told that they had just stopped using chicken broth and replaced it with veggie broth so I ordered the Hunan Kung Pao....  DELISH!!!  Thank you Earl's!!! The Vegan community is growing quite quickly and we all talk to each other and recommend places to eat. You are now on my list!!!"}
{"text":"First place I have been to where the server knew exactly which item was Vegan. There was only one..but I was happy. The Thai bowl with tofu....yummy!!!  Thanks so much!"}
