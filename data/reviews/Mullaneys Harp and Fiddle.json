{"text":"Irish pub in Pittsburgh.  Relax with live music, great food, great pub atmosphere.  Declan is always wonderful for a laugh!"}
{"text":"Moved to the Strip and tried the food with a group of four.  The Shepard's Pie was awful...I am not sure what the meat was and the flavor was odd.  One other person tried it and would not eat it.  The fish n chips were not good.  The fries were soggy and soft, fish mediocre.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.  AND IT WAS NOT CHEAP!!!  Will not go eat there again!"}
{"text":"As someone born and raised in the Emerald Isle, I don't want to burst any bubbles but this place isn't authentic. However, it is a fun time. The musicians have been pretty good whenever I've been in. I'd like to go in more but I can only manage their happy hour - unfortunately the place is too expensive for anything else. I had my first and last full night's drinking there a few weeks ago and we were all pretty shocked when we saw the check."}
{"text":"We went this past weekend for the oyster and guinness event.  Honestly, the guinness and the other beer we tried tasted a bit flat or wattered down.  The fish and chips were so soggy with oil that it was puddling on the plate.  I could not beleive that they sent it out like that.  Obviously the fryer was not hot enough and it was not edible.  
The oyster po boy was fine, so that must have been made in a different fryer.  We had to split that sandwich and then later split the second order (we went for a burger, which was actually pretty good), which made for a less enjoyable experience.
The staff was very nice, although I think that they could have used one more person for this event.  It took at least 10 minutes to get our drinks because they were so busy, and this was at 3:30 in the afternoon!"}
{"text":"I love authentic Irish pubs like this one. Probably the best tasting Guinness I've ever had. The food selection is a little limited but everything I've experienced there has been very tasty. My friend and I went there and he had the wings, according to him they were probably the best wings he has ever had. The atmosphere is very warm and friendly and often with live music."}
{"text":"Best Irish pub ever.   Been visiting for many years when in Pittsburgh.  Always have a Red Breast whiskey for starters.  Didn't eat this trip but enjoyed our red breast and some different drafts.  Quite a variety."}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place as we haven't explored the strip district because of the touristy feel and crowds..wanted to explore different areas of the city. The fish was kind of slimey and didn't have a good taste. The fries were really hard and had been cooked until they was no potato within them. The Shephard pie had instant mashed potato taste some crumbled hamburger and plain cheddar cheese on top with small shreds of carrot. Not much better than a KFC bowl and the onion rings were just the frozen food variety. Not sure why people like it so much. If we had been drinking we wouldn't care. Maybe they had a bad day. I would recommend paying attention to cook times and to get rid of the fish. Maybe use fresh or in store made ingredients for Shephard's pie"}
{"text":"Wonderful pub with excellent craic! Fish and chips are spot on and they have a great Irish whisky selection. Excellent service and good music! Real darts! English darts.... a rarity in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Most fun this Norwegian had with his Irish wife Saturday night!  Great music and Harp beer.  Looking forward to going back"}
{"text":"For the first time in my life, I sent my meal back to the kitchen. The Corn Beef in the Corn Beef and Cabbage tasted really bad and felt like I was chewing gum. Avoid that plate at all costs"}
{"text":"This is the first negative review I've written but it needs done to save anyone who may be thinking of eating here from having a miserable experience. To begin, we stopped in when it wasn't very busy...early afternoon..so we were surprised it was as dirty and unkept as it was. Sticky floors, bad smell, just general lack of housekeeping. The bartender was nice and cordial but that is the only positive thing I can say. The Sheppard's Pie was just aweful. Overly buttery with instant potatoes, too much cheap chedder cheese, the worst quality greasy ground hamburger and canned crunchy onions (on a Shepard's Pie?). I ate less than half and am debating if I will allow my dogs to eat the rest or throw it away.  The potato soup was so salty I chugged water afterwards to feel relief. I was physically Illl from the grease and butter. I mean that literally. The only thing Irish about this place is the name and the Guiness on tap. Other than an ill mannered and intoxicated uncultured college student no one will like this place. I have had better experiences at the Giant Eagle hot food counter. Sorry guys you have got to do better if you ever think ill return."}
{"text":"Came here for a few beers after a bit Pittsburgh yelp event. Which was awesome by the way. 

It's a nice cosy neighborhood bar to have a few i think. 

The prices for 2 beers were nearly 20 bucks. But they were craft beers. But i was a bit surprised and taken back by the price. But I'm sure a miller is 2 dollars. he he. 

I didn't stay very long. We had the journey back to Beaver County. But I liked the look of this place. Would be a good place to have a nice chat with some friends on a Wednesday night."}
{"text":"I have numerous bad experiences with Mullaneys Harp and Fiddle now.  It is one block from where I work so I only go for the convenience.  I usually get the steak salad which used to be good.  The last 4 times getting it, I have had issues.  One time it will be a nice full meal and other times it looks like a kids salad and for $13, that isn't worth it.  Last time I went for take out, my bill was $13 and some change.  I gave the bartender $15 and only received $1 back.  She decided to keep the rest of my change and acted like it was owed to her.  I didn't say anything but was bothered that she would assume that she could have my change.  Today, even though I said that I wouldn't go again, I was craving a salad and have little time for lunch.  I asked for medium cooked steak and it is BEYOND well done.  It is actually crispy.  The French fries on top are rock hard but are not burnt which seems to me to be recooked from yesterday.  I cannot eat this.  I will certainly walk the extra few blocks from now on to get food that is prepared properly.   Never again for me."}
{"text":"This is the most authentic Irish Pub you will find.   The food is good and plentiful and the beer selection is impressive.  I have been several times to the Ceili  dances on Tuesday night, they are a lot of fun, and the regulars are great about reaching out to teach newcomers. There's lots of live music, and a truly Irish ambiance."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood bar in the strip with authentic tasting Irish pub food. I'm a fan of going early (though it's so empty and lonely looking early in the day) for a brunch of bangers, rashers, and mash. Inventive cocktails, and events (on their calendar) are some high points. The bathrooms stick out in your mind though, because they're down some narrow stairs and seemingly so far away they might as well be in a different building. And they may be."}
{"text":"I've never not had a memorable time at Mullaneys. Whether it's the wonderfully fun atmosphere, great live music, traditional ambiance, friendly crowd or their annual Christmas karaoke, this place doesn't disappoint. It's one of the most authentic Irish pubs I've been to in Pittsburgh. I usually get the beer battered onion rings which I think is their only veggie food option and they're pretty good. Service is decent and the bartenders are always nice. If it's an Irish pub you're looking for, then look no further coz this is THE place. I was there for St. Patty's day this year and gosh it was a BLAST! And they have a weekly trivia night too!! 
PS: The two stars I've docked them are for lack of veggie options on the menu (At least one more would have been nice) and the poor condition of their (ladies) restrooms. :( I always try to avoid using the facilities there if I can help it.. and who wants to limit their beverages in an Irish bar in order to not have to pee right?"}
{"text":"I have conflicted feelings about Harp & Fiddle.  I love the space, the drinks, and the live music.  I do not, however, like the cover charge that happens for every single event. Great Guinness Toast (where you had to use plastic cups!)- $5; St. Patrick's Day Parade- $10!! We made it for breakfast on parade day, had a fine breakfast there (eggs, sausage, bacon, toast, potatoes for 8 bucks), then left for the parade.  We returned around noon, and they wanted 10 clams a piece to come back in and drink $6 Guinness out of a plastic cup.  I just couldn't do it, and neither could the rest of my party.  I also don't appreciate that the cover charges are never mentioned in their e-mail newsletter. I know a man's gotta make that money, but sheesh!"}
{"text":"Food was great, service outstanding. We had a very large group and our food came within short time. The waitress kept the drinks coming. Service was superb!
The Fish fry is HUGE!!!! so bring an empty stomach or share it! It so good! 
I recommend the reuben rolls (never heard of before), if you aren't hungry enough for a reuben sandwich. So good, I am thinking about them now... sitting at home.
Live music was OUTSTANDING!!! Crossing Celtic, you rocked!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a blast on St Patricks Day, and to see a band play.  It gets packed.  Mullaneys has been around for a long time -- possibly the oldest Irish pub I'm aware of.  It's never changed.  I love coming here--for beer and whiskey.

Today I came here for lunch.  I'd never had the food before.  It was just okay.  I ordered the crab caprese salad and you dont get very much for what it cost, and the server was charming and Irish, but the service was incredibly slow.  It took an hour and a half for lunch.

I think I'll only come here for drinking and fun, as a dining destination youve got so many other options in the Strip District!

...also, while I dont want the bar to change, it is looking incredibly worn.  Its in dire need of new paint and new flooring, lest it become a dive bar.

TWO STARS BECAUSE THIS PLACE IS DIRTY.  Its very dirty.  So dirty.  Maybe they  dont notice it at night during the bulk of their business.  Inch of dusk on the window sill.  So gross.  Please, please clean the bar."}
{"text":"We love Piper's Pub so anytime we were in the mood for this type of food, we would always just end up there.  Well, now that we live closer to the Harp and Fiddle, we decided to give it another try.  I have to say it was worth it.  It is completely different than our favorite place, but it is super good! 

The menu here is definitely different, but there are some good old staples... Shepherds Pie, Fish and Chips, and some basic sandwiches, etc.  I got the Fish and Chips and I thought that they were pretty damn good.  Loved the fries, AKA Chips.  We had the mussels as an app to start, and I have to say, I thought that they were awesome.  

It was not too busy, but it was steady for a 5pm dinner.  Lots of people imbibing some Guinness and other bevvies.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was definitely the most busy person working in the place.  I guess people needed some fuel after a busy day shopping in the Strip.

This is definitely more of an authentic Irish pub than those wanna be places like Claddagh or Fado (I know we do not have one here, but there was once one in Cleveland and there are still quite a few around).  They do not have an extensive whiskey or scotch list, so if that is what you are looking for, this may not be the best place (yet at least... seems like they are adding some new ones according to the bartender).  They have live music some nights too.  Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"We've heard both good and bad about this place.  My wife loves corned beef and cabagge so we had to try it. The atmosphere was great as was the entertainment.  The food was a bit of a disappointment.  Her corned beef was dry. I had a Shepard's pie. The chef had such a heavy hand with the salt that I couldn't taste anything else. This is probably a great place to listen to music and grab a beer. The food? Not so much."}
{"text":"They pour a proper Guinness! And the pear and chicken flat bread was delicious . Will definitely stop in again!"}
{"text":"This is an Irish pub that has done very little to attract new customers over the years or to retain the locals. The food is just OK and the service can be very slow at times. I have received bad attitude from a bartender there on more than one occasion that was uncalled for. I recommend grabbing a beer or bite somewhere else."}
{"text":"A couple small TVs, no three page list of craft beers. Is this how one enjoys a Steelers game? I suspect when you're the type that needs to take some refuge from pro sports, this place might be your oasis. 

In search of something resembling a vegetable in Pittsburgh, we had the deep fried pickles. Quite okay. Quite a decent Reuben sandwich. Would like to see a better beer selection. One of the few places open in the strip district after 5 pm."}
{"text":"Have you guys been here in the daylight? This place is filthy! 
I understand this place is old, but wash the curtains (they look like they've been in a flood) and those glass lamps hanging from the ceiling. The woodwork and floor are sticky. 
We had a Guinness (in the wrong glass I must add) and didn't have the stomach to eat anything. 
All this place needs is a good wash. Let me know when, we'll go back."}
{"text":"It's a little dark and gloomy in here, but the food is very good. My Shepherd's Pie was outstanding. The whiskey bundt cake we shared was also rockin'. Our server was a cute chick with awesome hair. Only Piper's Pub makes better Irish food than this place."}
{"text":"Excellent, attentive bartender who knows how to pour a Guinness properly. Live folk music and dancing is a big scene on Tuesday nights! Had a chicken salad with cranberries and blue cheese; zingy dressing and everything was fresh. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Mullaney's is an authentic Irish pub. On a Tuesday nights they have Irish dancing with live music and they offer lessons. They also have live music on Wed, Fri and Sat and Trivia on Thursday. St Paddy's Day is huge here with music inside the bar and in the parking lot in a huge tent. I have had burgers and shepherds pie here and both are good. I have not yet tried the fish and chips, so will have to report back! If you are actually Irish, this is your pub. If you would like to be Irish, this is your pub."}
{"text":"Decent food, fun crowd...older, good band. Beers many! I don't know there just isn't a crazy vibe that makes me want to come back that often! I guess that when this large chick checked me with her purse then barely said she was sorry...hmm no thanks. Major spillage all over my arm! I hate rude people, even as she watched me sop up beer from my new cardigan she gave me this smug look like it was my fault even though she had been bumping me all night.

I don't get pissed over things I can't control so I ignore ignorant people who like drama. We did have some excellent BBQ pulled pork nachos! Maybe an event there would be different but my experience...Yawn"}
{"text":"Group of us went on a Saturday afternoon.

Service was good. 

We ordered 3 apps: fried green beans, bread and cheese plate (with apple chutney spread) and flat bread with crab and artichoke. All tasty.

My girlfriend and I ordered the shepherd's pie. Both satisfied. My mother ordered the chicken tenders (again). They were fine. My uncle's girlfriend's had the chicken salad and fruit plate. She enjoyed it. My uncle had big problems with the fish and chips. He said the fish was greasy and the batter had an oily texture to it. Not good at all. 

Overall, the consensus was we'd go back."}
{"text":"All the way at the far end of the Strip we finally found the best bar in the neighborhood (admittedly out of only a handful that exist).

This place was charmingly well worn around the edges, but it's mostly a standard American-Irish pub, with all the familiar bric-a-brac and beer taps.  I have to object strenuously to a few of the drinks on the menu.  First, there is a \"Dark Bomb\"--Guinness and Jagermeister.  Then there is an \"Irish Pancake\"--Guinness and butterscotch schnapps.  And finally there is the \"Irish Hoe\"--half Guinness, half Hoegaarden.  These are crimes against nature.  I can't vouch for the last one, but the first two were terrible (of course I had to try them).  Jagermeister has no business within ten feet of Guinness, and the Pancake would have been okay if they halved the amount of butterscotch.  

This month's featured beer is Red Stripe--get five bottles for $15.  The pints have some odd prices:  $5.61 for Guinness and Newcastle and $4.68 for Sam Adams.

They had some live music (a guy with a wee guitar singing eclectic covers) which was decent and ended at 1am.  We were the last patrons before closing at 2, and despite them sweeping and putting up chairs, nobody ever chased us out or even looked at us askance."}
{"text":"I have only eaten at Mulaney's once and drank here twice but I hope to come more often. I had a traditional Pittsburgh steak salad that was pretty good but the real draw is the music. The first time we came in, the place was very busy and an Irish band was playing on stage. By contrast, the second time we came, there was just a small group of gentlemen at a table with an accordion and a fiddle, singing traditional Irish songs. Both nights were memorable and we hope to get more and more of our friends to stop in with us. It's great to go from Bayardstown, down the street, to Harp and Fiddle. You get to keep the music going while enjoying different perspectives on the art. All around bad ass. I would suggest watching drink prices though. They are pretty high."}
{"text":"I've been to the Harp a handful of times over the years, but I've only eaten there twice. Once was quite a few years ago and the second time was this past weekend. The first time I went, I got fish & chips, and I was so unimpressed that it's the primary reason that I refused to eat there since. BUT this past weekend, my wife ordered the fish & chips and wow...awesome! I would definitely order them going forward. It's a huge piece of fish, though, so be prepared. I'm not sure what changed, but I'm glad it's improved.

I opted for the blackened tilapia sandwich, which was also really good...and larger than I expected. My only complaint was that it seemed like a lot of roll even for the entire filet being on there. The creole mustard/mayo was good, but I used it sparingly. The side of chips (fries) were good and had that typical hand-cut taste.

We also ordered the mussels for our appetizer and they were really good. The Smithwick's broth was a different take on what we'd usually get our mussels steamed in and was delicious, and the mussels tasted fresh.

Overall, the vibe at the Harp is fun. Their large dining area has a dining hall feeling, which doesn't work for me when it's not busy and you sit down to eat, but it's good for their live music nights (which they have plenty of). I prefer sitting in the smaller bar area. The bartenders are always really nice and there's a nice neighborhood bar feeling when you're up there.

I'd say my only real semi-complaint is their limited whiskey options. If you're there for a Guinness, you're going to be happy, but if you want some whiskey, the limited list of Irish whiskeys may be underwhelming. We were told that they're working on making an actual list and adding to it, and there were some perfectly fine options, but you'll be disappointed if you want something even a little adventurous, like a Connemara or something.

Regardless, it's a nice, laid back option in the Strip, and if you're in the mood for some fish & chips you're really limited to two excellent options in town: Piper's Pub or the Harp & Fiddle."}
{"text":"We made the foolish mistake of trying to spend our Groupon at Penn Brewery on a Saturday, without a reservation.  Daunted by the wait, and bellies hungry for delicious comfort food, my boyfriend I were sullenly driving back toward home when we remembered - isn't there a little Irish bar just off the main drag of the Strip District?  Let's go investigate.

So investigate we did, I'd say around 730 on a Saturday night.  It was oddly quiet and uncrowded inside - a few tables here and there, but no big groups gathered around to watch a game over drinks, or eat dinner.  There was lots of Irish paraphernalia on the walls, but the harsh lighting and widely spaced tables made the bar feel a bit uninviting.  A little dimness could've gone a long way!  We got some beer on draft - a Harp for me - and started with the fried pickles, which were served with honey mustard.  They were.....fried pickles.  They were served as whole spears, not bite-size pieces, so sometimes the breading would slide off, but they were hot and tasty with the tangy mustard.  Good size appetizer portion.

Both craving something authentic, my boyfriend got the fish 'n' chips, and I got the corned beef and cabbage.  Both were utterly no frills.  My boyfriend lauded their authenticity, and I have to confess, the fish 'n' chips were spot on.  Especially the fish.  That taste!  It took me back to my semester studying abroad in England, eating fish 'n' chips out of a paper cone.  It didn't need anything fancy or unique to dress it up - it was great as it was.  He was hugely satisfied.

I was underwhelmed with my corned beef and cabbage.  While I won't question the authenticity, the overall effect was that the food was plain.  Well-cooked, and in a good portion, but not really crave-worthy.  There were some vegetables on the side as well, everything prepared with utter simplicity.  I enjoyed the taste, but after a few bites, I wanted something more.  It was a large portion, so I took some home, but we weren't even motivated to reheat it.  It didn't really do it for me.   Apologies to Ireland if that's how this dish was meant to be prepared - if that's the case, I suppose it just wasn't my thing.

We started to leave just as a few musicians came in.  I think I'd enjoy coming back here for a drink and an appetizer during some live Irish music!  Service was a bit slow, but if I was there to relax and unwind for a few hours, I wouldn't mind at all."}
{"text":"Had a great time there. Nice people nice atmosphere. The band was great corned beef and Curry. Food was good."}
{"text":"My blood type is probably a cross between a fine stout and a smooth Irish whiskey.  At the Harp I feel right at home.  They have THE Best pour of Guinness in Pittsburgh and they also offer the widest selections of rare Irish whiskeys. The bartenders and servers are beyond outstanding and the fellow drinkers are very friendly. It makes sense that they have been successful for over 25 years!"}
{"text":"Harp & Fiddle is the gem in Pittsburgh's strip district.  They have several beers on tap, great food, and a nice, relaxed atmosphere.  The staff is especially pleasant and very friendly.  H&F is an excellent place for the end of the work week.  They have nightly specials during happy hour Which lasts from 5pm to 7pm. H&F also has live bands playing nightly.  The acts range from up tempo rock music to laid back acoustic guitar acts.  Overall, H&F has something for everyone and is an awesome place to go for good beer and good times with the people you love to be around."}
{"text":"I really really really love Harp & Fiddle.  Though I live in Denver now, I spent a fair amount of time in Pittsburgh and my office is right down the street.  Even if it weren't, I'd still spend time here.

Last week, while in Pittsburgh I ate lunch here two of the three days I was in town.  Seems that each time I visit, they've made some changes to their menu and their food is always consistently good.  On this visit, I had the salmon chopped salad one day and the chicken cordon bleu sandwich the other.  The salad was perfect for lunch - exactly what I was looking for and reasonably priced as well.  A lot of times it's empty in here at lunch time (sometimes it's not) and I don't get it.  The lunch options toward the east end of the strip aren't many, so I'm surprised more people haven't caught on to lunch at the Harp.  Oh well, their loss is my gain.  

In addition to being a regular lunch spot, this is also usually my choice for drinks after work as well.  My brother and I have spend many long nights at the bar and it's usually the first choice for work happy hours too.  Sad to say, that I used to spend SO much time here when I lived in PGH that when I walk in now, they remember my drink.  OOPS!  We've been here for Irish Dancing night, open mic night and karaoke night - they're all pretty amusing.  They also have a nice little pato out back for when the weather is warmer.

Whether they're busy or slow, the service is always spot on.  I really wish there was a place like this in my neighborhood in Denver."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Ordered Sheppard's Pie, as one of my friends had previously done and told me to as well. I was not disappointed! Really great food. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was here recently for a baby shower. I thought it was an interesting place to hold the event so I was a bit apprehensive. I was here one time before when my partner played a music show so I was like, hmm for a baby shower? But I just went with it. 

We got in and the lower part of the restaurant was where the babyshower was. So people could still walk through and go to the bar but we had the bottom basically to ourselves. Now I will say that since the restaurant part was right by the door everyone who was going to the bar had to walk through the party. Not a huge deal but kinda an inconvenience. A few times people were like is it open or can I come through. It just was slightly distracting. 

But the space was open and fun. The kids at the party got to play on the stage. And they seemed to like that. It wasn't baby friendly so much but it's a bar so I didn't expect it to be. 

The snacks we got to try were a meat, cheese, and veggie tray as well as chicken nuggets and meatballs. The food wasn't bad. I will say the chicken was pretty good and I ate my fair share. I wish there were more veggies, those went really fast. But that was more of an order problem than a representation of the place. The meatballs also weren't bad. 

I don't know if I would say pick this place for a party like this, but it worked. And if you are ok with it then go with it.

The only question I have, do they have ADA compliant bathrooms? Because the bathrooms that we were told to use were in the basement down steep steps. That might be a point to also consider.

Other than that, I like it here for drinks and music but might think twice about a baby shower party here."}
{"text":"Before catching Soilwork at Altar Bar one recent evening, I decided to bring Kay here to satiate her longing for Piper's Pub, and there's no better substitute to The Piper than the Harp & Fiddle.

Greeted by Samantha, our foxy, elfin, onyx-haired, raspy-voiced and practiced server as well as a gaggle of fellow metallions, we took in the rustic, eclectic decor as we perused the bill of fare and pondered the choices that laid before us. 

Like PP, H&F offers British Isle-flavored fare such as Shepherd's Pie and Bangers 'n Mash, and not-so-Anglophile items as Asian Fish Tacos, burgers, and Bayou Shrimp, but being in such an establishment, we felt obligated to sample some the standards. 

Shepherd's Pie (Samantha's favorite!) was ordered by Kay, and the B 'n M was shared by us as a starter, but for my entree, I threw the dart at something I'd never heard of before: Chicken Ballincollig.

Flaps of luscious chicken breast lounged on a bed of flavorful and weighty garlic mashed potatoes and were eclipsed by a softly, sweetly smoked tomato coulis that would make one helluva potent pizza or spaghetti sauce. Is it \"authentic?\" Should I be at all concerned? Smother it in cheese and put it atop some pasta, and you'd have Chicken Parmesan. Either someone has a creative mind, Ireland and Italy stole some riffs from each other, or two cooks simply had the same delectable idea. 

One taste of Kay's Shepherd Pie, however, and I almost wished we'd just shared that. H&F's version differs in size from PP's (it's a little smaller), and includes shredded cheddar and onion crisps in addition to the usual ground meat (lamb?) and vegetables. Kay faltered 3/4 of the way through, so I stepped in to finish it, gladly taking in the gravy which resembled corned beef to my tastebuds, the rich tubers, and all else that makes this the king of casseroles. 

Dessert for two was a humble Whiskey Bundt Cake that was as moist as a marsh yet only had a subtle booze essence to it that this non-drinker welcomed. 

Harp & Fiddle is a worthy cousin and parallel to Piper's Pub in cuisine, atmosphere, and location. Slow down if you're speeding through Penn Avenue and give them a chance to charm you. 

P.S. To address some of the negative reviews, I saw nothing dirty about the place nor was anyone remotely rude to us. We were here while the sun was still out too."}
{"text":"This is the best Irish pub in the city; while Claddagh is a corporate chain (that isn't quite authentic), and Piper's Pub is a wonderful pub... of the British Isles, Mullaney's is Irish, and a great place to grab some food and drink.

Tons of travelling entertainers and bands, fantastic eats, and friendly, good staff."}
{"text":"There's usually something fun and exciting going on here whether it's dancing or Irish bands.

I have had the shepherds pie which I thoroughly enjoyed, very authentic. I also came here for an oyster festival which was amazing! 

The crowd tends to be a little more mature which is nice!"}
{"text":"Went to The Harp last night with a small group to grab a few beers and listen to Mark Guiser. Mark didn't disappoint and got the small crowd going with some of our favorite Irish songs. Wednesdays they have Guinness and wings specials. Great place to go during the week since it usually isn't crowded and to listen to some good music."}
