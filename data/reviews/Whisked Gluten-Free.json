{"text":"Yes yes yes! This is my new dessert place in Scarborough. 

First off, the shop is clean and organized. The lady helping me and my son was super sweet to us (my son adored her). 

Secondly, they had a pretty good selection. My son got the brownie, while I got macarons and the hazelnut cupcake. The Brownie was basically a brownie should be. It was very chocolatey and sweet. Paired perfectly with nice glass of soy milk for me.  The hazelnut cupcake was not what I expected. It had a wonderful taste of hazelnut and the icing was not your typical buttercream icing. I don't know what its called but it was the perfect compliment to the actual cake part. The macarons had the texture I was looking for in a proper macaron. I just wish the flavors stood out to me more. 

I'll be back this week =l

Rating overall: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"Dear God. The cook-at-home frozen gluten-free cinnamon roll set is heavenly, far better even than any ordinary cinnamon rolls. Fluffy, juicy and perfect! They honestly felt like they saved my life after a 2-year-long drought in this cold cold world of gluten.  The blueberry scones and chocolate coconut cupcakes were wonderful too. Next up we're going to try the ready-mixed gluten free pastry flour, so that we can make our own fluffy baked goods. The owners are wonderful and so generous with gluten free baking and cooking advice. Check their recipe blog online, with easy new food recipes as well. I actually feel grateful to be gluten intolerant when Whisked is in the world! Is it worth travelling here from downtown Toronto? Are you kidding??  I would crawl here if I had to!! Better than any gluten free bakery I've found in the world, including New York, and elsewhere in Canada. Thank you :-)"}
{"text":"So thrilled to have found this bakery in my neighbourhood! I've only tried the baguette and sandwich buns but both were incredibly delicious - even my gluten loving husband couldn't taste the difference in the baguette! The owner is also very lovely, friendly and eager to help find what you were looking for. I'll be back soon to try the delicious looking cupcakes."}
{"text":"Bought a dozen cupcakes for my son's birthday party.  The cupcakes were pretty.  But most of the kids at the party didn't want to eat much of their cupcakes because they said the cupcakes were too sweet.  I had a few of the leftover cupcakes, and I agree that they are very sweet but I was too hungry to care.   The $5 baguette was a big hit.  My kids gobbled it up in no time.  Probably I will want to buy more baguettes next time."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to try new baked goods with a coffee.

However, there was no coffee and no place to seat.  It's only to buy and go.

We tried the blueberry scones, chocolate chip cookie, ginger crinkle and a red velvet cupcake.

What we purchased tasted great and would go back to try other items."}
{"text":"Got the vegan cupcake and bread. Cupcake was hard as rock and tasted bad, and the bread sucked. Never going back."}
{"text":"Although they advertise Gluten free and vegan the only vegan choices right around noon on a Sunday were cupcakes, cookies, hamburger buns and frozen bread.  Not worth the drive and nothing purchased or tasted, sadly.  

IMHO they should either take vegan off their menu or get serious about it."}
{"text":"We had a sampler box of macaroons from Whisked. They were fresh, light, fluffy inside, crisp on the outside and visually appealing. Pistachio was my favorite. 

I'm not on a gluten-free diet, but these taste great and didn't taste like a compromise. Loved it."}
{"text":"I ordered a gluten free carrot cake from here for a birthday party and it was well worth the money! It is the best GF Cake I have ever tasted! My husband had no idea it was GF because the texture was perfect! Soft and moist!! Defiantly recommend to anyone needing GF cakes!!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the brownie on the top of the chocolate caramel cupcake but the pineapple coconut macaroon was even better! Pretty expensive but worth it. Great selection, nice staff. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The best gluten free bakery! 

Whisked is truly amazing. It's a small local bakery located in Scarborough and  is easily accessible by 401. They have the most delicious gluten free baked goods in the GTA. A pretty big selection of breads, cakes, muffins, and macaroons etc. You can call the bakery a day in advance and order something you like. I usually go there on Sundays and they always have warm fresh bread. Not only it's gluten free, it also tastes so wonderful!!! My personal favorites are pizza dough, cheese bread and cinnamon buns."}
{"text":"For starters, I had a vanilla 7\" non-dairy cake (gluten free) ordered. Lady on the phone was slightly rude but nothing I couldn't ignore. On the day of picking up the cake, I also purchased a ginger cookie and a birthday cake macaron. Both rated 3.5/5. Prior to ordering, the lady on the phone told me their batter consists of tapioca flour, mullet flour, sorghum, arrow root and guar gum. Never having tried these ingredients in a mixture before I decided to take a chance. Now that I've actually tasted the cake I'd like to warn anyone interested. This combination of ingredients do not taste anything remotely close to a vanilla cake. It's a huge disappointment to be quite honest. The dough has a cornbread taste with a hard spongy texture. The icing tastes similar to walmart's awful lackluster icing as well. The worst part is they do not offer samples before purchasing and their \"creations\" are not cheap either. Would not recommend. I'm really disappointed because all I wanted was a great tasting cake that did not contain gluten or dairy. I do not feel my expectations were met. Edit: I was also informed that because of my subjective opinions regarding the cake, no type of compensation would be possible. You've been warned.

Edit 2: In regards to Miss Christine's comment, it's quite funny that she's decided to respond months later. Miss Christine also seems to have selective memory with a knack for telling lies because NO ONE cut the cake I received. Her stating that she catered to our request is proof that she's pulling sh*t out of her a**. In any case, a vanilla cake that lacks vanilla extract is simply just a combination of ingredients with zero flavour. The cake sucked and even if compensation was or wasn't offered, the cake still sucked. No one is bullying you as we're all grown adults here. If you cannot handle being given poor reviews that differ from your own opinion of the \"creations\" you create, then maybe reconsider being in the food service industry. Next time you try to lie on a customer, make sure the person you're trying won't see to be your match."}
{"text":"Really the best macarons I've tasted outside Montreal. They were so fresh and light . Most importantly they were just sweet enough! 

What's more pleasant was that we stumbled upon their buy 1 get 1 free macarons deal so we got our box of your for half price!"}
{"text":"Absolute gluten free gem in Scarborough.  A must visit place.  Everything I've had has been so tasty.  The breads are fantastic.  Though my favourites are any of their lemon based products.  There are fresh items and frozen items.  As well they have started making their own mixes.  And the best part is that the prices are great and the staff fantastic."}
{"text":"Wonderful!!! If you are looking for an allergy friendly dessert, this is a wonderful option!! My daughter's daycare is nut free but along with that, there are lots of kids who have allergies to gluten, soy, dairy and eggs. The double chocolate cupcakes were good for all the kids to enjoy!!"}
{"text":"The fact that they offer these yummy bakery items gluten free is an absolute plus! You can't even tell their cupcakes are gluten free. They are beautifully designed and delicious. They offer a variety of different gluten free cookie options. Will be coming here to get all my gluten free goodies!!!"}
{"text":"I came here to try the macarons. They have a lot of varieties and flavours. They are good size macarons at a reasonable price compared to other places.

I tried the blueberry cheesecake and the Belgian chocolate. The Belgian chocolate was amazing. I would recommend it. The blueberry cheesecake was good too.

I recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a God-send for all those in the East end that can't tolerate gluten. I have a friend who cuts corners with his gluten and lactose allergy and sometimes he's ok, but other times it's bad. In the case of Whisked Gluten-Free bakery, his dabbling in dessert will always end up being a safe and delicious choice. They offer many gluten-free products ranging from breads, cakes, mini loaves, cookies, macaroons, biscotti, cupcakes, muffins, and even croutons! Some of the products even cater to people who are lactose-free or even vegans so be sure to check with the staff when perusing their selection.

If you want something specific, your best bet would be to call in and ask or even place an order. Otherwise, you'd have to rely on what they have in-store. The staff there are very pleasant and extremely helpful. Their cakes are tasty, moist, and not overly sweet. I also enjoyed the double chocolate quinoa cookies and their macaroons are off the chain!"}
{"text":"Came here to try out their vegan treats so I got the chocolate raspberry cupcake and their chocolate chip cookie.

I love that it's not too sweet especially thebcupcake cus of the raspberry filling that offsets the sweetness.  They also have other treats you can check out."}
{"text":"I was dreading having to go gluten free because options are so limited....and everything gluten free  I'd tasted in the past was really dry or over preserved. After reading reviews, I thought I'd give this place a shot. On my first run, I picked up a loaf of bread, cookies, macaroons, a date square, a pastry filled with cooked eggs (I don't remember what it's called)  and scones. My bill was only $35.  And To my surprise, everything was absolutely delicious! The macaroons were similar to those in Paris, the bread was moist and light, the scones were good and even better warmed up. I'm so glad I found this bakery, I'll definitely be a repeat customer!"}
