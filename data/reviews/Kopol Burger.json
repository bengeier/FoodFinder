{"text":"My wife and I used Yelp to locate a burger place on our route home and Kopol Burger came up with good reviews so we decided to try it.  Other reviews described the interior as minimalist. I thought it was very sleek and modern looking as well clean, open and bright.   We had 2 classic burgers and fries and just water as our choices of soft drinks were out of stock. When we got our burgers my reaction to the size was, \"are you kidding\"?  It was big!  But I ate it all.  You can tell the burger was freshly made, no frozen hockey pucks here. It was tender, flavourful and delicious. The lettuce and tomato garnish were also fresh and full of flavour. Neither of us are pickle people so we passed on that option. It was served with 4 little containers of a spicy mustard, ketchup, mango sauce and their special Kopol sauce. I stuck with the mustard and ketchup but my wife enjoyed the Kopol sauce.   But the bun..... it was the best I've ever tasted. I asked afterwards and was told it's from a Persian bakery. It had incredible taste and texture and raised an already great burger to a whole new level. The burger and bun was too large for my wife so she ate it open faced. Even though I was pretty full I ate most of her unused bun, because it was that good!  The fries were seasoned and tasty but being a traditionalist I'll order them plain next time, and yes there will be a next time!   Well done Kopol Burger!!!!"}
{"text":"I have never wrote any reviews for any restaurants in my life! But my experience at this restaurant today made me write one finally.  For the longest time I was looking for a burger place in Toronto area with this quality and taste but I couldn't find one. I was so happy to find out today that finally somebody put the love and  effort to create such an amazing piece of art in GTA.  The burger, the fries, the salad, the sauces will all get A+ in my opinion. The service, cleanliness and the look of place also deserves A+.  Through a suggestion of my sister I traveled from Brampton to Richmondhill to try this new place and let me tell you that it was worth every penny I spent on 407 to get there. I'm planning to go there again every chance I get."}
{"text":"My son and I always being in the search for the all mighty burger, did a quick search to see which target would be in our sights for tonight.   Found a new place called Kopol Burger with some pretty high recent praise, so we set off.   Greated and welcomed right away by the owner going in the door. Of course we ordered up the larger burger on then menu the Kopol with fries and drinks. Price was on par wth the other \"elite\" burger joints double or large burgers. Ok, so food arrives. Fries first. BIG box of well cooked and tossed with a nice assortment of seasoning fries. Being a Montrealer I am usually a traditional fry guy, salt and vinegar, but these were pretty darn tasty. Also came with a foursome of sauces to dip in, their home made Kopol burger sauce, a fusion mango, garlic parmesean and a hot sauce, oh and of course ketchup. Nice touch. Burger comes. Holy crap. Its a huge burger for the money. And not only 2 huge patties. But well seasoned, nicely cooked, quality meat ones. Bun 5+++ stars. Could be one of the best burger buns I have had anywhere. Soft, but with a perfect crust and taste. This put the burger over the edge. Great service all along as well.  All things combined, one of the best burger experiences we have had.  Huge recommendation from us to try this place out.  I know we will be back a ton."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Food is delicious, staff are super friendly and the restaurant is very nice! Definitely coming back for more. Oh and the burgers are huge! And it has the Zabeeha by hand certificate"}
{"text":"Glad I went by Kopol Burger. 2 things stand out- The Service and The food. I decided to get the veggie burger at my first visit and I was greeted by the chef with open arms. I decided to sit in. The decor is neat and simple just like its menu. No over the top menu. The menu serves the need- having a handful of burgers to choose from to meet your preference. The burger arrived and they explained the sauces that came with the burger. The burger was definitely bigger than I expected. The bread was crispy and the falafel patty was cooked to perfection. What really elevated was the sauces that came with the burger. I also got the  fries garnished with parmesan and parsley. Definitely a place to check in RH"}
{"text":"Amazing burger! Wow...the sauces are really good. You can tell it's made from scratch. The meat melts in your mouth. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Best burger I ever had everything was so good I would go there again again and again loved it thank you kopolburger me and my friends loved it the smell of the fries  the good smell of the juicy burger smell loved it loved it best burger place ever."}
{"text":"Burgers are very tasty, quite large and simply amazing. The owner/operator is the most welcoming guy you meet and the speed is fine. Will go back. If anything the spice on the fries could be a bit less."}
{"text":"If you're considering coming here, you better be really hungry. I came and ordered the classic burger combo (one patty) and the burger turned out to be huge. I asked the owner/cook if it was a half pound burger and he said he tries to aim for a 6 ounce, but often they end up bigger. Uh, yeah. This baby was definitely more like 8 ounces than 6.   The classic burger is served on a sesame bun which was crisper on the outside than I'm used to for burger buns. Don't worry, it works for this burger. Because the burger is so big and so juicy, it helps to have that extra structural integrity from a crisper bun. The inside of the bun is nice and soft so it's definitely not too dense for the burger.  The patty itself is fairly mildly seasoned, but I think the chef takes into account the strong-flavoured toppings. The burger is topped with some hardcore tangy Kosher pickle slices. If the patty itself were more salted or strongly seasoned, the whole burger might be too salty because of the Kosher pickles. If you do not like really strong pickles, you might want to ask for those to be omitted. Personally, I'm a fan.  I suppose the owners are still mixing things up because the fries I was served look different than those pictured here by other reviewers. My fries were super thin, crispy, and well seasoned. I'm not usually the biggest fan of skinny fries, but these were rather addictive. It certainly didn't hurt that they were served with a wide variety of unusual dipping sauces.   We were also served a small portion of pasta salad and chickpea salad.   This meal was huge! I finished my burger, but not my fries or salads. If you're a really small eater, you might want to split the burger and/or fries with a friend. The price is about on par with Holy Chuck or Burgers Priest and you get much more food here.   The owners were super friendly, attentive, and really interested in our thoughts and opinions about the food. You couldn't ask for nicer people running this business. Also, the restaurant is super clean and modern looking, so it's a pleasure to dine in."}
{"text":"Burger is massive, one of the best toasted bun for a burger where I enjoy the bun just as much as the beef! Nice favour to the beef and season fries are nice change from the standard fresh cut.  Good sauce options if you like to dip your fries!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. Price was right, $10 for a burger, fries and a drink. Burger was big, tasty and well topped. The bun was tasty but is a little too much for the burger. The fries are also very good, seasoned with some parsley and other little spices. Served with a side of small, various dipping sauces. Overall it was very tasty. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"We started with fries which was really yummy and came with few different sauces. The burger was good too but i have to say the fries portion and burger was huge!!! 2 burgers, fries and drink was $39 but with the huge portions the price make sense! The patties needed more seasoning in my opinion but other than that everything was great plus friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Classy design and clean location.with a testy home made burger. Ask for special sauce.!!! Armosphere inside is very calm and relaxing  Can see your burgers cooked in front of you fresh."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, generous portions, and very tasty. Service was good and the owner was very kind.   I got the 18oz burger and it was a monster!"}
{"text":"Very cosy and friendly environment with delicious burgers. The owner is vey friendly, which makes me feel he actually enjoys what he does and its not only about the business as most places are nowadays. Burgers are delicious and not too costly. Their sauce is really good and all together with the fries, it makes for a prefect meal."}
{"text":"Kopol Burger is tucked away in the corner of a small plaza in the south east corner of Bayview and 16th.  It is very easy to miss.  I had been meaning to check them out for a while now to see what it's all about.  Upon entry, I found the owner extremely friendly and he seems to love what he does.  I asked about the name, and apparently \"kopol\" is Persian for a chubby dude, which is what he is portraying in his burgers, as they are on the larger side.  Also, their meat is halal.  The interior of the restaurant is newly renovated, bright, and clean.  As the other reviewers mention, the burgers are MASSIVE!  The patties are like 6 to 8 ounces, and look like a home-made ground beef patty.  Flavor-wise, the patties are on the plainer side, with not much marinade mixed in.  The bun has a thicker crust than your usual burger bun.  To add a stronger overall flavour, the owner adds his own kopol sauce to the burger which is like a pinkish mayo, as well as lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles to supplement the patty.  All together, it tastes pretty decent.  However, the stand out for me is the fries.  The fries are done very well and seasoned to perfection.  They supply ketchup, kopol sauce, #5 hot sauce, and #10 hot sauce to go with the fries order!  Kopol Burger has its work cut out as Fresh Burger is just up the street.  Hopefully they can hang around and carve out a niche with their excellent fries and halal offering.  I give the burger 3.5 stars + another 0.5 star for the fries."}
{"text":"All I can say is that the place was very CLEAN the server was extremely FRIENDLY and the food was DELICIOUS. Is there anything else a restaurant really needs to do besides having those  three things ?   I stopped by on my drive home from work and decided to order a cheeseburger. The burger was delicious perfectly cooked through and assembled well together along with the special purple Kopol Sauce. The fries were pretty awesome too as they were extremely crispy and came with a nice seasoning.   The inside of the place was extremely clean and modern looking. There is no reason anyone shouldn't give this place a try."}
{"text":"Interesting twist on a burger. Middle eastern flavours were yummy. The crunch on the bun provided nice texture and the sauces were great.  The garlic parm fries were a highlight.  Friendly service to boot!"}
{"text":"This is crazy...I walked in hungry and as usual wanted to get biggest portion but my intuition stopped me for some reasons. I ended up ordering cheese burger combo and I can assure even if you ate hungry portion can easily feed two people but if are crazy burger lover you should definitely get Kopol pound burger, just don't forget to grab couple friends with you so you can share your burger otherwise it will be your lunch and dinner  By the way this place is Halal. Good luck guys!"}
{"text":"For all my muzzies with few halal options in richmond hill, kopol burger serves excellent halal hamburgers here. Its cooked to perfection, with melted cheese and homemade sauces, its a recipe that can't go wrong.   Really chic interior hidden in an unsuspecting plaza, kopol burger caters to the bougy fast food lovers. 10/10 recommend."}
{"text":"I came in here as a skeptic but left a believer. While the place has solid reviews, there's not a lot so my expectations were \"optimistically low\".  But I was actually quite pleasantly surprised if not blown away.  This place is located in what feels like  subterranean plaza on the south side of 16 16th avenue off of Bayview, just off of petro canada.  Driving by you can VERY easily miss this plaza.   Entering this place, the decor is very minimalistic, as well as the kitchen. It's a walk up to the counter to order set up. The kitchen seemed empty as well, but things were clean. The person serving us was also very pleasant to deal with.  We ended up getting the classic burger combo, which came with the burger, a can of pop, fries, and 3 different sauce (ketchup, spicy, and \"crazy spicy\").  After ordering, the checkout also seemed to only take electronic payment methods, not sure if they actually take cash?  We sat down as we waited for our order, and our cook/order taker also brought us our meal to our table.  Upon first looks, the fries were quite nice looking, covered in some green flakes that I want to say is parsley, but could be wrong. 3 different sauces, pop and the burger itself.  When I opened the packaging of the burger it was very subtle but super duper tasty.  It's on a type of sesame bun that was crispy/crunchy on the outside, but melts in your mouth soft on the inside. It held all the juices of the sauces inside the sandwich whee they are supposed to be. A lot of other burger places over look this small but vital detail. Other burgers have nice soft bread, but as you eat the burger all the juices cause the bread to disintegrate.  The toppings and sauces seemed to be middle eastern themed, so pickles, tomatoes etc. Reminiscent of the toppings from a shawarma, so it doesn't have your traditional relish, mustard. The patty itself was very tasty. It's made from fresh chuck, and it shows. When you take a bite, it's juicy, meaty tasting with steam coming out, and just breaks apart in your mouth. It was very easy to chew.   Overall though it's a very unassuming place, all the subtle touches made this an incredibly tasty meal.   Did I forget to mention that the burger patty was also huge? I was absolutely stuffed after eating everything. I was full, but not overly. Some places make such big burgers I feel like I killed a cow after eating and feel guilty and overly stuffed. Other places I leave feeling wanting. This place really pushes the envelope between gluttony and satisfaction.  Overall, it was surprisingly tasty and I wouldn't hesitate to come back. Definitely a very well kept secret in Richmond Hill.  But if your a traditionalist, where you want your mustard, relish etc this may not be the place for you."}
{"text":"One of the most delicious burgers ever. Their classic burger is larger than one imagines and it's hard to believe it's only 6 oz. I haven't tried the kopol burger which contains 2 patties but I bet it's going to be a beast.  Anyways, my burger was cooked to perfection and it was served with a side of chickpea salad. The mango sauce that came as a side was also delicious.  On top of the great food, the service was also outstanding. The owner is a very friendly person and makes you feel welcomed.  I have been there a couple of times so far, and I am definitely going to go back!"}
{"text":"Pros: -Very little wait time -friendly customer service -clean and new restaurant -affordable price (lunch special!) -food made fresh in front of you (you can see it being made- I'm looking at you food hygienists!) -tasteful decor -TASTYY  Cons -location is hard to find"}
{"text":"I always get the chicken burger and it's just amazing!!Everyone needs to try, It has a unique taste that I've never tasted in a burger before and that's what I like about It, finally a burger that is unique and not the same taste as every other boring burger over and over again."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with everything. Burger was dry and the fries a let down. Fresh burger down the street is a much better bang for your buck."}
{"text":"We tried this place on a whim , glad that we did . It's not your usual burger place which is quite nice if you feel the need to eat your sandwich on quaint surroundings . Beautiful black and white interior , made me think of gourmet . The place just opened and there was only one person manning the place his service was excellent. The food in my opinion was one of the good ones we've tried , definitely something different than your usual burger . The portion was huge , I took a photo with my phone just to illustrate the size . And just to show an example how great the service was , our burgers came out cut in half and wrapped individually because our server knew hubby and I were sharing . Very thoughtful and attentive . The bread was crusty and soft on the inside which I found just right . Our order came with four different sauces , one was ketchup for the ones that liked classic burger taste , the three others we didn't know the name but seems like mango chutney , pink sauce ( for lack of name to call it) and hot sauce close to sriracha but not quite . While eating the server came out and asked us how the food was (again service spot on !) ."}
{"text":"Not a bad burger but not something I would have again. Patty tastes like a dry Koobideh. Much better burgers in the area, I would recommend Fresh burger instead."}
{"text":"I decided to try out this place yesterday afternoon with my boyfriend after reading all the excellent reviews about this relatively new place (Kopol Burger opened roughly two months ago). I was not disappointed, and if you decide to try this place out as well, you will not be either!   My boyfriend and I ordered a class burger combo which comes with fries and a drink. The owner informed us that he would be freshly making the burger so he invited us to have a seat while he prepared the food. When the fries were ready, the owner was kind enough to walk the food out to our table and informed us what each sauce on the tray was. I believe there were at least five sauces he provided in addition to some macaroni salad that he gave us two servings of on the side!   The fries are some of the best I've had. There's parmesan and dill sprinkled onto them which gives them a burst of flavor even without using any of the myriad of sauces provided. If you enjoy crispy fries the same way I do, this place is will be your new go to place for that.   When the burger was ready, the owner asked whether or not we'd like it cut in half so it could be easily shared. We opted to not have it cut in half as I was already full just off of eating half of the portion of fries (mind you, the portion he gave us was extremely generous). My boyfriend seldom ever comments on food as he is a simple man but he said that he would definitely come back again.   Lastly, our combo as you recall, comes with a drink although the owner ended up giving us two. I'm not entirely sure how the owner managed to do this but he read my mind. He ended up giving me a Schweppes ginger ale, and a Nestea to my boyfriend which was exactly what each of us wanted despite the fact that we never specified what we wanted to drink.  If you enjoy good food at an extremely reasonable price, I invite you to give Kopol Burger a try!"}
{"text":"I usually wait to do reviews.  Post some pictures and then wait.  Let it sink in.  Let the good feelings wax and wane and see how I feel about it.  Sometimes go back and do it all over again so I can get it right.  I'm really struggling with this one.  Since the opening of Kopol, there has been a barrage of 5-star ratings.  Most from people who have never wrote a review and some with so few reviews, it was suspicious to say the least - as of tonight there was 17 other reviews that were not being displayed, a lot of 5 stars again.    Then a few reviews by Elites showed up and it looked promising.  I've been to trying to go here more than a few times and they were closed or no one was in the place and I started to doubt the reviews and the potential freshness of the place.  Well tonight was the night we were going to go for it.  It was open and my bud was hungry...I was a little busy eating all day already but...why not.  The restaurant had a party going so it was busier than I've seen it.  That's a good sign.  The place itself is minimalist in decor.  The mid-east spices were in the air but the place was NA modern.  The whole restaurant was black and white and none of the wall hangings screamed burger joint or mid-east.  We both ordered the single 6oz cheeseburger, fries, and drink combo.  The burger comes dressed with lettuce, tomato, pickles, Kopal Sauce.  Kind of a pink beet like runny mayo.  I was flipping through the pictures (lots from the business and new reviewers) and noticed one of the burgers had jalapeño and mint on it.  My bud likes heat so he went and ask for it.  The guy just said we don't serve any peppers.  Wot!?!Da?!?Fudge?!?  really?!?  I just saw a picture!!!  Food came and it was huge.  I looked at it with a good portion of fries - dusted with green dried spice that made it look moldy...sort of, and 4 tiny dips.  More copal sauce, I think something that tasted like tamarind, another one I can't place and ketchup.    At first sight, it looked great - we do eat with our eyes.  I started to take the burger apart.  The cheese looked like a processed single, the beef look kind of greyish - maybe from all the added spices, and there was a chuck of lettuce that made the burger an inch higher.  Lots of pickles and slices of tomato.  Had to take out the lettuce so I could handle it.  The burger is messy.  The sauce dripped out all over the place.  First bite and you can taste the mid-east spices on the patty and the beef kind of broke away too easy and was a bit...chalky.  You know if you over marinate meat, it loses its form and gets mushy - well I think the patties have been spiced and sitting too long.  A real no-no is that the drink was only Pepsi.  I needed a hypo-caloric drink - fancy way of saying diet pop - and he didn't even have a diet pepsi or a bottle of water to substitute it.  I had to have a pepsi.  Really?  Yes...his beverage cooler had only cans of pepsi and one ginger ale.  Again, not a good sign - had to eat the food sans cola.  All in all, I think the reviews were really hyped up.  My friend, who is mid-eastern, was even less impressed.  Sometimes the hype can work against you and I have no idea where all these mysterious 5 star ratings were coming from.  I do not like to dislike places, but between all the phantom reviews, my high expectations going in, and contrasting with my personal experience here makes this a 2.5 star.  Basically take it or leave it.  Food was ok-ish, service was good, place was really clean but this is not a comeback place for me.  Cheers."}
