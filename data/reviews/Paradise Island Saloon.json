{"text":"I can only second Loren's review, 7/9.  The only reason that I gave this restaurant any stars at all is that the food is good, and the prices are reasonable.  Also our waitress was very pleasant.  The service was good.
All of the above was terribly offset by the atmosphere.  Let me add that prior to eating there this evening I had checked out their web site.  There is a HUGE DISCONNECT between what is portrayed on the web site and what we found when we got to the restaurant.  What we found when we entered the establishment is nothing like the web site images.  When we walked in I felt that the atmosphere was unappealing, and very loud.  Since this was the case as it was a pleasant summer evening we elected to dine on the patio.  Smoking is permitted on the patio and this was a huge turnoff.  A number of the patrons had had too much to drink and course vulgar language was inescapable.  
Overall this experience was a let down.  We like to support local businesses and to dine at restaurants that are not part of a chain.  However, we will not be returning to the Paradise Restaurant.  It is anything but a paradise!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome, the drinks are good, but this one bartender gets drunk and starts acting racist towards black people, I'm just just sayin....?"}
{"text":"Good happy hour prices and the have a free appetizer every Friday during happy hour. There happy hour is a little different than most places, it's from 2-5. The menu has a good selection with comparable prices. They have a smaller late night menu for you night owls."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Table was not wiped clean when they were not busy at all. Refused to take my entertainment coupon that was clearly valid. Even after speaking to the manager. Didn't even get our drinks until we decided to leave."}
{"text":"We love Paradise...it is one of the best kept secrets in Euclid. We have gone there a couple of times on date nights, and it has a really great environment. The music is random, from the Eagles to modern rap, and they always have sports on. We have had the same waitress every time, Roberta, and she is wonderful. She remembers us every time! She is quick to greet us when we arrive and brings our drinks (which are delicious and well priced) out quickly. She is a competent and courteous waitress, and we make sure to always sit in her section. The food is delicious...I recommend the sticks as an appetizer. The food is always well prepared and scrumptious. This is definitely the kind of place to become a regular."}
{"text":"This place is run by a group of fools. Trying to educate these people about a simple app that would offer them a business incentive for thier customers was like trying to show a idiot how to read a child's book.......give them the page, show them how o read, and they are still too dumb to learn. Don't mind not knowing something.....but ignorance is inexcusable. I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great place to watch football.  Food is decent... I have had way better bar food.  We only ordered the buffalo chicken dip.  While the portion was huge, it did not have a traditional buffalo chicken taste.  Just about everything on the menu is fried so choose wisely (even the pita bread that came with our buffalo chicken app was fried).  Mostly domestic beers.  Be super careful going to the bathroom... The stairs are treacherous.  Limited parking."}
{"text":"We went there to listen to the Beatles tribute band. They were pretty good and we had an enjoyable evening. Our waitress made a great Keylime cocktail. We ordered pizza but it came burned. They were nice enough to take off 50%. The draft beer was flat."}
{"text":"If I'm ever in Euclid on a Wednesday night and in need of the a delicious burger and fries, cheap tasty drinks, and some awesome entertainment I will be at Paradise Island. 

Sure it's not very trendy or stylish, It's divey and the service isn't very good. But the service isn't very good at most divey bars... so it is what it is. If you are vocal and get their attention they will get to you, but if you aren't they will probably be doing shots with the regulars.

I was unsure about ordering food because of some of the reviews... As someone who primarily eats at pretty nice restaurants I guess I just didn't order any of the stuff that these people did. I was fairly surprised that the food was as good as it was. Plus I love that they have sesame seed buns, they seem to be abandoned by all but crappy fast food chains.

There was a band playing 90's music which was great we ended up dancing and staying much longer than intended. They have a lot of drinks perfect for people who don't like the taste of alcohol. I tried the Hawaiian Punch and it actually tasted exactly like the artificially flavored juice that I used to love as a kid. While my adult brain was screaming CAUTION!!! the kid in my heart was like THIS IS AWESOME!!! that coupled with the music made for a gleefully nostalgic Wednesday night. I must admit that I did switch to gin and tonics because my body was going into sugar overload, but the drinks were CHEAP. Like 5 bucks for a cocktail, 3 something for a G&T cheap. Plus it was 3 dollar wine night. 

I don't make it to Euclid much, but if I do I'd probably come back just because the drinks are so cheap. But I'd also probably take an uber... or DD."}
{"text":"Decent wings. Terribble service from both bartenders. Only seem to pay any attention to their friends or regulars or do absolutely nothing at all.  Would not go back."}
{"text":"I live around the corner from here and went there last year and was not thrilled. Went there a few days ago to watch the Indians and have one of their awesome rum buckets. While I was there we ordered some of their appetizers and was pleasantly surprised. The portions were on the smaller end, more like tapas but they were very tasty. I love their rum bucket! The ladies that were serving were just ok. I had to wait to order my drink because the one kept walking past me and ignoring me, the other server was very attentive but seemed to be doing majority of the work. 
would recommend trying this place. It has become my new favorite local spot."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with the menu! Normal bar food with a few twists. Of course we ordered the wings! We had a dry rub and we had the house \"Paradise\" sauce for dipping. The real treat were the mussels! I was skeptical at first but they were delicious. The wine selection was kind of limited. No Pinot Grigio or Riesling. Other than the wine, I would definitely recommend visiting."}
{"text":"went here last night.......This place was suggested by one of  my older twin sisters who has been visiting this place often in the last year and plus it was they birthday ,I am usually very cautious about trying new food at places especially if I haven't heard a great deal of reasons why I should go (that's why I am so glad  that Yelp was invented). It wan about 10 of us including  4 kids,*side note(its probably ok but I really don't suggest bringing kids there after 10 pm because it really turns bar like atmosphere and who wants to be bothered listening to kids while they are drinking not me) Anyway we had a really nice server name  Lauren ,she  got everything right and was very informative , friendly, and patient with my crazy family in which my twin sisters are both in foodservice also ,so they know a good server when they see one. Okay anyway the food was so good ,piping hot and fresh ,the cook did is 
Damn thang ! We ordered 50 wings with that good paradise  sauce for all of us to share which I think was a good price of $35.00 or something like that , and well over enough ,their mussels were so so good and very fresh ,tasted better than some local seafood resturants  I have been to, we also had others items off the menu and they all were so good NOT ONE COMPLAINT HERE! Drinks was point , they had long islands on special that were very good and strong  , they  even make frozen drinks for the light drinkers. This going to  be my new go to spot, I got to bring my husband back here he would love they food. PLEASE KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK PARADISE!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Paradise Island gastropub many times.  This afternoon I had the philly sandwich.  Last time I had a chicken sandwich.  I've also had the pizza and home-made potato chips.  Everything that comes out of the kitchen is top-notch and flavorful.

The staff is super-nice too.  

It has a nice, diverse customer base.  It's like the \"Cheers\" of the neighborhood, except that it also has great food.  

I has been a meet-up place for my family for several years.  We all love it."}
{"text":"I just left this place.  Usually it's cool.  Today was horrible. Long wait yet not crowded.  Drinks 20 min wait place order 29 more minutes even though told waitress was ready when we ordered drinks. 45 minute wait for food.  45 min wait for check. 25 minute wait to pay bill. Then had the nerve to ask did I want to leave a tip?  For who I asked.  Talked to 3 different women.  And food was mediocre at best. The food used to be so great. But guess it's just pub food now.  At one point didn't see any wait staff or a barmaid.  Anywhere. Not the patio bar or the dining floor.  For at least 25 minutes."}
{"text":"We decided on Paradise this last Saturday and there were four of us. We picked one of the booths on the raised back section. Our waitress took over 10 minutes to greet us which surprised us because she encouraged us to pick wherever we wanted to sit as we came In The door. We all asked for water with our drinks from the bar and she only brought 1 water. Then she returned to the table to ask me what I ordered because she forgot. After I told her , she looked around the table and asked everyone what they ordered, admitting she forgot all our orders. It was awkward more than charming. I ordered the chicken tacos, told her this twice, and she still brought me fish tacos. Our food took an obscene amount of time to arrive to begin with. Our friend ordered the fried pickles. The waitress forgot. We had to flag down another barmaid to see if we would ever get them. My husband ordered the wrap , it's made from cold cuts , and his food took a good 5 minutes of waiting before we had to ask where it was after everyone else's arrived. The rum drink my friend ordered tasted off. The imitation garlic in my friends burger  was so overpowering he had to scrape it off. All of these issues were politely verbalized to the waitress but she did not seem to care. She was an older very thin blonde woman. She was very slow with bringing Anything out, was not even remotely apologetic or interested in remediating the issues. And then it was like she just disappeared. I asked the helpful barmaid if it was this woman's first day, she literally seemed in another world. The barmaid , Brandy, was apologetic and took over our table. She apologized and finished out the order. But at the end if the day, I never got the right food, we had to wait a ridiculous amount of time, our food was less than par. This is the third time we have been to Paradise. The first two times were each under different owners. I think these owners do a great job of teasing the local heavy drinkers with music or free appetizers on Fridays but it's not worth the trip."}
{"text":"This is sort just like a little neighborhood dive bar. If you want a really good pizza though....... its worth the stop. they have a mushroom and goat cheese pizza that is everything. The crust is buttery, garlic-y, and crispy. I love it. They also have a great loaded tatter tot... who doesn't like tatter tots. You can wash it all down with a $5 pitcher of the beer of the month.

Sometimes they have a band there that is really loud and it just makes the experience intolerable. if you get there and cant hear yourself think, just get the pizza to go."}
{"text":"Haven't tried the food here, with the exception of the nachos they put out during Happy Hour.  That plus a couple of beers on a Friday afternoon are a great way to start the weekend.

The beers are mostly domestic, but they do have some microbrews on tap, including Great Lakes.  Staff is generally nice, too."}
{"text":"Wow.  After hearing a ton of radio ads on 92.3 I decided to give this place a try.  I wish I wouldve gone sooner.  It is a pretty small venue and tables were scarce on the Friday I went.  We found two spots at the bar and I was happy we didnt have to wait.  Just a heads up that this place is pretty small...not in a bad way.  The parking lot also has free valet.  So, back to the menu......I honestly wanted to try a little of everything.  I went for the brisket sandwich and paid extra for a side of tots.  The sandwich was HUGE....I literally had to take some meat off to eat the sandwich.  The brisket was cooked to perfection and had great flavor.  I would also def recommend getting a side of \"Paradise Sauce\" to dip the tots in.  Its the special house sauce and is very good.  While we were waiting to pay our bill......the couple next to us got the tacos and my jaw dropped.  These were 3 HUGE tacos and looked amazing....I'm pretty sure hers had bacon on it.  There are so many more things I want to try on this menu and look forward to my return trip.  Live bands on weekends as well.  I didnt have a chance to check out the downstairs but willl on my return trip.  Pictures to come as well"}
{"text":"I've been in 3 times since I've been in town. Terrible service at the bar and if I go sit at the table. Food is not fresh and taste like it's out of a microwave. 
Guess I need to find another place while in town."}
{"text":"Great band (90s Alternative cover band). Decent food.  HORRIBLE service.  Three bartenders that would either stand around and count tips or walk right past you when you needed something.  Place has potential, but needs a new bar staff."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for years!! I am in love with the atmosphere and the food. I'm sure I've had almost everything on the menu! My favorite are the chicken rolls and they have the biggest mozzarella sticks!! They are known for their rum buckets that are amazing also! I recommend everyone to try them!"}
{"text":"Can't say much about the drinks 
But the calm chowder was tasty and filling 
Waitress had to be asked to wipe down the area on the bar I was going to eat at 
Not bad for the price"}
{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday for lunch with 1 other person and sat at bar. Service is extremely slow, even when there is nobody there. Food took about 40 minutes... wow. It was decent food but not sure what took so long. Bartenders only focus on people they know. Will not return to this place, plenty of other places to choose from in the area."}
{"text":"One of my favorite haunts. Good food, great people. Very clean & tidy. They make mean drinks!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Paradise Island Tavern. We met friends there to hear the band, Jello Shots. Excellent band that plays 50's-70's music .   My husband ordered clam chowder and I ordered a burger. I've been taste testing burgers at restaurants and this burger was delicious!   I would definitely eat there again, our waitress was so friendly, and the tavern is also wheel chair friendly. Very nice surprise!"}
{"text":"Terrible I repeat terrible service. Took 15 minutes to get a server to come over to the table. 3 out of 4 meals we odered came out wrong because the trashy server (ripping shots with friends at the bar instead of helping customers) thought she was too cool to right down an order and as we predicted did not have the mental capacity to remember anyone's order.  Also friend of server came up to her to talk while she was taking our order. The most rude thing I have seen at a resturant (if you want to call it that). Felt like a trap house with people blowing hookah and arguing like they were at home. Never going back and can't wait for this place to shut down so better managemnt can move in."}
{"text":"Horrible place to be at. Loud live bands, not big enough for that. No food, they run out of everything. I've been there twice and will never return. Lousy place to spend my earned money."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The waitress was rude and refused to take my order any longer because 2 of 7 people I came with did not tip. When we explained they had to leave to pick someone up and were coming back to finish eating and things they cursed at us told us they didn't care if they cant tip they shouldn't come out. I'm highly upset they treated me and my friends this way when everyone else did in fact tip them.

Regarding the food... it was not they greatest their chicken wings only thing that taste good and anywhere near fresh."}
{"text":"Ok, so this place deserves an amazing rating! I'm a bit of a snob, I used to be a trained chef... But this place blew my mind! For quite a while, I saw this place pop up but never tried it. Today- we decided to.

The menu was very enticing, being current enough to pique interest without being pretentious, and the prices incredibly reasonable! The woman I spoke to on the phone was very kind and helpful. My husband and I basically ordered everything and the price was amazingly cheap!

When I ordered the beef tacos for only $9 she asked me how I would prefer my filet to be cooked! I didn't know how to answer that! It came home to me as an amazingly cooked filet with the toppings as any quality place would do.

Last but not least, my crabby husband said he made a last minute request of extra dressing and the server was very accommodating.  This place officially ticked all of the boxes for me! I will have to go through the entire menu before going anywhere else to eat!!! Thank you guys!!!!"}
{"text":"We went in this past Saturday bar was full no big deal sat at a table.  Bartenders seem us sitting there never acknowledge us. We sat for 15 mins not one person asked for our drinks. Bartenders were more interested in doing shots. We left never coming back to poor service bar again."}
{"text":"Food was good and lots of it for the price. Service was very slow especially since it wasn't very busy. I'm not much for the bar scene, we sat outside but all the smokers hung out outside. All the bad language made it's way out too. Definitely not a family hang out."}
{"text":"Nothing like writing a lengthy review and having my computer lock up.  Therefore I will shorten it and be to the point.

Food: OK based on wings and their other deep fried varieties but I don't think I've tried enough to shy you away from trying the food here.  'I personally want to try the Philly steak since they claim to use cheez whiz.'  I have tried it and will go back and get it again.  My only comments would be that I would have liked to see fresh mushrooms instead of canned and a little better bun but regardless, its packed full of meat and veggies, good stuff.

Drinks:  Cheap happy hour bottles and drafts last time I went.  Bartenders seem to be a little younger but they do have a heavy hand.  Good variety of liquors.

Ambiance: Boy, lots of potential.  Jukebox, lots of seating, people watching patio, overall very clean, just lacking one thing......people.

The worst part of this newly renovated restaurant is that the bathrooms are in the basement so watch your head.

Not sure what the night time crowd (if there is one) would be like but mind the neighborhood before going.

I did go there off and on for 3 weeks, maybe every other day or so, just to see what the clientele would be like, but it never really changed.  This was last summer so we can only hope its changed.  Stopped in a couple weeks ago for a work retirement party and we all had fun.  Willing to go there again so drop me a message and I'll meet you there.

Cheers."}
{"text":"Having never been here before, I came with an open mind. There is a love band playing & while the band sounds good, it's a little too loud. Food came out quickly- onion rings are Definitely home made but dipping sauce was a little too thick. Still good tho. Chicken tenders were for sure frozen first & while alright, could have been made fresh with the onion ring batter to be be yummier. Drinks are alright but not up to state code on the pour. They are charging more & pouring less- unacceptable. We were told it was due to the owners presence. Less alcohol means I may not be back unless you can get it right. Sorry."}
{"text":"Just had a great Terryaki Dish... The Daily Special... The guy next to me was eating it and it smelled and looked delicious... And he concurred, so I, too ordered it!

The wings are among the best around,,, May I suggest the \"Paradise Sauce\"?

Chef James whips up some great dishes along with an incredible burger.... 

Did I mention beer? Plenty of the \"regulars\", but also a few surprises on tap!

Entertainment every Friday & Saturday!!! Always a ball. @ Paradise Island Saloon!"}
