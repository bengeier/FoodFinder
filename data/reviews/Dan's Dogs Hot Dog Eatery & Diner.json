{"text":"It's a hot dog joint, in the best terms. Sort of a diner, but in a storefront. I generally have a glorified hotdog and some of their homemade soup. Just great. Service is prompt and super informal. Fine. [burp] I'll go back often."}
{"text":"What a great place to grab a quick lunch. Absolutely love the workers. You can tell that they love their job and their happiness shines throughout the diner."}
{"text":"Though the hot dog may be considered somewhat minor on the culinary scale, it will continue to reign in the heart of most diners as a satisfying comfort item. It is so accessible in any number of venues, which can often result in a tremendous disappointment as evidenced by dog day at Progressive Field. Therefore, when one finds an establishment that raises the bar with this humble foodstuff, it is very nearly a religious experience. On a recent trip to Medina, our search for a quick, economical meal led us to Dan's.  The venue radiates a nostalgic vibe reminiscent of the 50s diner, and was additionally festooned with holiday trinkets that also added to the warm fuzzy. The staff welcomes each customer as they come through the door with a casualness that makes even newcomers feel like regulars. And after sampling their fare, you will be converted to a regular follower.  I was informed by our server, Tiffany, of the specials and of how each item was presented. (Tuesdays feature jumbos reduced to $2.22 and though I am not normally a fan of the oversized wiener, my conviction was altered.)  The menu lists a dozen and more of combinations though I settled on my personal favorites of the slaw dog and a Chicago style with a side of mac and cheese. My companion settled on the Italian sausage, chili chees fries and a small shake. I opted for the Dan's style root beer.  Within minutes the service was on the table. Dan's uses Sugardale brand dogs and it's a fine durable bow wow. They are served in the New England butter fold over rolls which is very distinctive. Deelicious. The mac incorporates 7 cheese and is baked, yes, baked daily. It's served in a crock and was creamy, gooey magic. My only suggestion from a personal desire would be to pop it under the broiler with some bread crumbs. The fries were shoe string, fresh, hot and tasty. The chili is a bit spicy but nothing requiring first aid for those with sensitive palates.  My companion enjoyed her Italian selection that had the right level of fennel.  The on site manager, Paul Davis, visited with us for awhile and gave us the background on the site including the fact that they have been there since 1991 as well as all the fine details on how their products are prepared.  As I have stated in other reviews, I only take the time to comment on restaurants if they have impressed or depressed me. Dan's is a top dog!!! And I can't wait to get back for another round. Great job"}
{"text":"Fun Family environment. Great prices for amazing food. I highly recommend coming and bringing the whole family. I would also recommend coming past the lunch hour, because it gets  busy. The service is also amazing all of the servers are so nice! Get the Ruben dog. It's the best!"}
{"text":"Prices are slightly more than what I would expect for a hot dog diner. The food and menu is in line with a throwback hot dog eatery and they do have many hot dogs with very different toppings on them. The Dog paws are real good for a side. I would skip the root beer, as I do not think it is worth the price. Service was attentive and friendly. I would go again, but only if I was in the mood for a hot dog with crazy toppings."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Dan's Dogs since I was just a wee little pup (see what I did there?). There aren't many places you can go in Medina (particularly right on the square) where you can take a family of 4 to eat for under $25. The new management is doing a fantastic job. The restaurant is cleaner and the acceptance of credit cards is a major plus. I've had to have been here at least 50 times over the course of my life and I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is great, classic diner look, very neat atmosphere.  The staff is friendly and the prices are fair.  A very large menu/variety of hot dogs to choose from, with some other items available on the menu as well.  Staff is very friendly and the restaurant is clean.  It is CASH only, so be prepared."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here.  The staff is very friendly and the food was very good.  The only small complaint was the French fries.  I didn't think they were very good.  Everything else was great."}
{"text":"I've often dreamed of opening a hot dog eatery.  Dan's would be the perfect model.  So many hot dogs to try, so little time.  I may have to go back this week while I am here.  Courteous staff, old Soda Fountain look and feel, and yes, you can get peanut butter and jelly on a hot dog....and like it.  Oh, they have burgers and other stuff too, but c'mon, really?"}
{"text":"If you're looking for some great hotdogs, this is the place to be. This place has the classic 50s vibes going, with friendly staff to boot.   I ordered the meat lovers hot dog with a homemade rootbeer and fries. Though the hotdog was delicious, I would suggest ordering a jumbo dog because the regular left me wanting more. The root beer was amazing and I would most certainly buy a keg if they did that.  Dessert was a malted chocolate milkshake with whipped cream and almonds on top. It was very tasty, but it wasn't as thick as other milkshakes, something I would've preferred.  Overall a great experience and will definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"My family and I love Dan's Dogs.  The Deputy Dawg is a hit (peanut butter and jelly), but all their creations are worth trying.  What really brings us back is the service.  The staff does an excellent job, even on busy Saturday nights.  The place is always filled with positive energy that keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"Fun, fun, fun!!! Lots of fun food, fun retro dining & fun for families!!! New owners have added debit/credit option & have continued to keep a good thing going."}
{"text":"About two dozen varieties of hot dogs, with just about any combination of toppings available. Dogs range from $2-3.50 depending on the toppings and size (regular or \"jumbo\" = 1/2 lb) . I'd recommend the pizza dog, or anything with Cleveland stadium mustard if you've never had it.  Definitely skip the mediocre shoestring fries and head straight to the onion rings, which are much more flavorful.  Made the mistake of pumping a quarter in the jukebox to hear Hang on Sloopy. Apparently Emily V. has had too much of Puff the Magic Dragon, flipped out, and turned the volume on the jukbox so low that you can barely hear the baseline.  Cash only.  Apparently the water-damged ceiling near the kitchen and restrooms is part of the charm. I was told it's been like that for 17 years. It's a legitimate concern that plaster might fall into food as it leaves the pass.  Service is a little disorganized as you might expect."}
{"text":"This diner is perfect for a Saturday afternoon lunch after the farmer's market. Expect a bit of a wait and don't get the Mountain Dew. It's too syrupy. Cash only."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at Dan's Dogs.  They have cute options for different ways to eat a hot dog. I didn't know there were so many different ways! The service is always kind, the food is always prepared in a timely manner. Restaurant is clean, cute 1940's-1950's deco.  The only thing I can find myself getting irritated at on the occasion is the seating. There's not much room in this place. On a busy summer night, expect to be crowded by everyone else in Medina.   Other than that, I am a huge fan of Dan's Dogs, and especially their polish dog :)"}
{"text":"We are in Medina visiting family and stopped here for a quick bite.  We gotta come back.  There are so many hotdog options, you would have to eat every meal here for several weeks!  Loved the dog, loved the root beer float, loved the surroundings. I went back in time to a diner of the 50's. What else can I say? It was fun, tasty and a trip back in time.  I only wish the table jukeboxes worked... ;)"}
{"text":"Medina tradition. We visit several times annually since if you live in Medina it's what you do. Fun place. And the new owner does a great job. The place for dogs but great pierogis too!"}
{"text":"This place rates just ok with me. I wish I could like it more. Especially since I have 2 kids that love hotdogs.  It's just that it seems to take a long time to get just to get some dogs - maybe I am comparing it to Skyline's superfast service but when I usually cave to junk food its because I am HUNGRY :) and waiting for 15 minutes for a few hotdogs when there are not many other people seems unnecessary.  The other thing is that the whole place needs a deep cleaning.  I had the unfortunate experience of my son losing a tooth there and searching under the tables was just disgusting.  The couple times we have been here we have had friendly service.  If the food came out faster we would definitely visit more often. CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"Being from detroit i grew up on coney dogs. This is the closest to America coney i have had in ohio. The toasted buns are a nice bonus and root beer is fantastic. Service was quick and very nice"}
{"text":"I just visited Dan's Dogs for the first time with my boyfriend and it was an awesome experience. I ordered the Mac Attack dog. Which has freakin MAC AND CHEESE on it people!! I added chili to it as well. This place made me feel like a kid again. It reminded me of eating cut up hot dogs and mac and cheese, but on another level. I also ordered a root beer float which was topped with whipped cream and sprinkles. The service here was awesome. We went and it was busy enough for little to no open tables. We sat at the bar and the staff was super friendly to us and actually had a conversation with us. The food was amazing, and so was the staff!!"}
{"text":"Best ever , hubby and I tried several different dogs and we were blown away!!!! Our bill came under $20 amazing . Great service!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Charming diner feel and really well made hotdogs. Some of the best onion rings around. And well trained staff that do a great job each time we have been in. Love it!!!"}
{"text":"Dan's Dogs Hot Dog Eatery was such a unique and fun place to visit/eat. The theme was very retro 50s. One of the tables was made of an old arcade game. The table I sat at had an old juke box. Going in, we were able to pick anywhere to sit. We came at a great time too, as we were ordering tons of people began to come in. It seems like a very popular place.  The menu had a great variety. For the adventurous foodie, the multitude of hot dog combinations was fantastic. Being not the biggest fan of hot dogs, I opted for their chicken herb sandwich with a side of applesauce. The chicken was delicious, cooked perfectly, and so tender. The applesauce was also a great light side!  The staff was incredibly friendly. It is a kid friendly place. The price was very cheap! I would come back again and try some more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Love it here ! It's a total steal for what you get - fab hot dogs for 3.29? Sign me up. We always get the Mac and cheese hot dog and the fab chili cheese fries . The salads are also so good and the chicken. Salad is amazing."}
{"text":"Visited Dans dogs for the first time had a blast One thing i learn is you wanna try something new every visit. This place is cheap and you guaranteed to get a meal under 20.00 based on what you order."}
{"text":"Anytime your wiener is between two buns, it's a good day. This place is always busy, definately not going out of business anytime soon. They have a PB&J dog, but as any red blooded American, I need an incredible amount of meat and cheese on everything I eat... which this place delivered. 10/10 would dine again."}
{"text":"This place was a blast from the past. The service was great, friendly, and easy going. Prices were very affordable. Definitely would revisit again."}
{"text":"Ordered 10 hotdogs between our party of 4. Every single one was delicious in its own way! Ask about any new items they have not put on the menu yet, they are coming up with new ideas for new dogs everyday. Always great. Under new management, they now accept credit/debit cards!"}
{"text":"Prepare for one of the best hot dogs you've ever had! I went with the Mac and cheese dog. A hot dog loaded with home made Mac and cheese and a side order of fries. The service here is great. This is the perfect place for a quick bite to eat!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I love the hotdogs! Burgers aren't bad either. The kids always want to go here. Noisey, fast-paced, its all good. It sorta needs remodeled though."}
{"text":"Don't eat meat? Yes they have an option so your husband can have one of there delicious regular hotdogs. Fun to order to go walk around the square taking in the sites and shops!"}
{"text":"It's been a year since we've been here. We noted some changes to the staff and atmosphere. I like it.  They haven't changed the menus, service, or the quality. Still the best hot dogs in North East Ohio. I miss this this place a lot and want to come back more often. Great energy and great food and an unbelievable price."}
{"text":"I love this place. From the 50's theme & neon pink decor (and it's so cozy!) to the delicious food to the wonderful customer service and reasonable prices! I've eaten here around five times and it's consistent in quality of food and service. Yesterday, I had a Dan's Famous Dog (buttery toasted bun, pickles with a salty zing to them, mustard) and the Italian sausage with green peppers. Awesome. Hot chocolate with whipped topping, creamy cole slaw and to-die-for homemade mac & cheese. All fabulous. Five stars all the way."}
{"text":"Great dogs! Awesome little spot with funky toys for kids and awesome decor! The service is always great - small town venue with big, fun personality. Owners are super friendly & it's usually busy lunch/dinner & weeekends!"}
{"text":"Holy Hot Dog!! Just a great and fun place to go. We moved to Ohio recently and we found our new favorite spot! The hot dogs are delicious, root beer was amazing, and the onion rings were fabulous!! We will be back.... often!!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I at there friday 8-4-15  and  it wasnt busy busy but it was okay.. well anyway  we sat down and sat there for about 5 minutes  not even offered a drink..   the waitress finally comes over and takes our order  which the food got there pretty fast..   after finishing my 1st cup of pepsi  it was 15 minutes before she even checked up on us but could check up on the other people she was serving!"}
{"text":"Step back into the 50's at the divey diner on the Square! Lots of options for dog lovers and burgers too! Nacho dog was amazing! Loved that I could taste the dog and all the toppings only made it better! Fab shakes, bebop music and the bathrooms will tickle Grease fans."}
{"text":"I've ate so many hot dogs this week for the home opening week of the Tribe and this place is, by far, the best! Loved the era feel and the thin fries were cooked great!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Never gets old... Especially with my kids. It's sort of become a family tradition to stop by to celebrate birthdays! The kids can never walk out of there without asking for a starter for the gum ball machine"}
{"text":"Every time I'm in or around Medina I try to stop by for a delicious hot dog, some onion rings and a jamocha milkshake. (Don't forget to bring cash!) Definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Four dogs at lunch a couple of weeks ago and I'm headed back next week for more.  I can't wait to try some of the other combinations.  Of the four I sampled, the peanut-butter and jelly dog was the best. Who would have thought that combination would work on a hot dog.  Boy does it, and it is fantastic.  The coney sauce on one of the other dogs was as good as I would want and the slaw on the other was equally as tasty.   Hot dogs are my guilty pleasure and Dan's Dogs is the pace to indulge my hot dog sinning. The diner-like atmosphere is a perfect setting for a dog filled lunch with friends.  The service is friendly and the prices very reasonable.   I drove up from Columbus to met a friend for lunch and Dan's Dogs made the drive worthwhile, well seeing my friend for lunch was nice too.   If anyone finds themselves in Medina and wants a nice, casual and very tasty lunch (I'm sure dinner is just as good) stop at Dan's Dogs.  You will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite hot dog place and arguably one of my top 3 restaurants! I love hot dogs and I love dans dogs. Great environment,  awesome diner food, and the service is helpful and relaxed. So many hot dogs to choose from as well as burgers and fries, etc. Root beer is great here too!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Dan's Dog's since the mid-90s when my mother would take me once a year for my birthday. Some time in high school (2002-2006) I began to frequent the establishment on a regular basis. Now, nearly 20 years since my first trip through the doors, I live in Los Angeles and absolutely MUST visit Dan's Dogs EVERY time I come home to Medina, OH.   From the Three Amigo dog to the Taco Dog, I absolutely love the buns, the service, the prices, and quantity.. oh.. and don't forget the décor!   Dan's Dogs is an American tradition; the type of place you want to bring your kids to, and they'll likely bring their kids decades later. In case you couldn't tell, Dan's Dogs: A hot dog eatery is my favorite restaurant in the country :-)"}
{"text":"love this place. A cute kitschy little diner! I try a new type of hot dog every time I come in, and I've yet to be disappointed (Hula dog = awesome).  The shakes are great, too.  Go with that or a root beer float. I forgot to bring cash once, but there was a ATM nearby."}
{"text":"What am I missing? Other reviews sounded promising and I was looking forward to my food. Massive disappointment. When you have a Chicago style dog as your centerpiece it should be at least an equivalent. Sliced jalapeños does not equal sport peppers, crummy burger style pickle slice does not equal fresh pickle spears, crappy watery relish does not equal nuclear green Chicago style relish. Are they even Vienna dogs?? All piled on a soggy bun and you guessed it, no poppy seeds. And of course, no hand cut fries."}
{"text":"Yes, the hot dogs are great! The variety of choices abounds, and the atmosphere and service are terrific. They do fantastic milk shakes and their root beer float is sublime! On the menu, be aware that their hotdogs are listed in order of popularity, not complexity. Their soups are usually homemade and are excellent! Also, no there really is no \"Dan\" but the current owner is usually in the kitchen and his charming wife works in the main area . They don't take credit cards so bring cash!! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Classic! This place is one i love coming back to when im in town. A must try is their root beer floats. Their food is wonderful and goes great with the diner vibes! I have never had a problem and never had to wait ! The staff has always been welcoming and ready."}
{"text":"Dan's Dogs is set up as a 1950s diner just off the main square. We went on a Wednesday for dinner. We order the double root beer float and it was plenty for two or just one thirsty boy. We ordered four different dogs and no sides. I would love to tell which ones we ordered but you should try them on your own. I will tell you that there is a party in my tummy which is very satisfied.   We cannot wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Good hot dogs horrible service! Our hot dogs took 40 minutes to come out. Waitress hardly checked on us. And some kid bugged us about our ketchup bottles twice. We felt rushed and unwelcome. They seemed in a huge rush to close even though they were open for another 40 minutes. Also the fries were cold when they arrived at our table. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Love love love! The have the best hot dog combinations- definitely have to try something new whenever I go! Surprisingly the dog with PB&J is great! The owners are so sweet and awesome. The rest of the staff is cool too. Love the vibe in this place."}
{"text":"I'm surprised there isn't a review here.  This is a small place with nice, small town, hot dog place vibe.  Food is OK, not great, not bad.  Cash only.  If you're in the area, it's worth a stop."}
{"text":"Love this place! Delicious food and wonderful service. The staff is super friendly. My favorite are the taco dogs and cheese fries. We always stop in every time I'm in Medina. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Unique experience.  The only hot dogs I would go to a restaurant to eat!  So many unique combinations.  Good milkshakes."}
{"text":"Visited Dan's Dogs today.  Have visited often over the last 20 years.  Our order was wrong but they did correct it.  Since the ownership changed I see differences in the cleanliness of the store.  The doors, ledges,  and other areas don't appear to have been cleaned since my last visit.  The white front door is black from all the filth.  I honestly was afraid to eat anything so we just got shakes and left.  I hope they can put the effort back into this place like it had been cared for all the years prior as I really had enjoyed it."}
{"text":"My family loves this place. A little overpriced, but they make up for it with the many choices of toppings. Good dogs and onion rings."}
{"text":"To start off i would like to warn you this place is cash only. Please dont let that keep you from eating here. Go grab some cash and come back youll be so happy you did!  Visiting from California and a local resident suggested this restaurant.  I was a little skeptical at first I do like hot dogs, but wasnt sure if that was going to be all they had to choose from on the menue.  As soon as I walked inside I fell in love with the decor. A cute 50's diner with little jukeboxes on the tables. A bunch of cool old signs hanging on the walls. They make there own root beer here too! I opened the menue and was shocked to see around 30 different hot dog options, they serve burgers, chilli cheese fries, salads, and sandwiches!  I had a difficult time deciding on what to order! I decided I should order a hot dog because after all, the name of the restaurant is Dan's Famous Dogs! I ordered the mac n cheese dog and it was delicious!  I would highly recommend you eat here!!"}
{"text":"Very good hot dogs.  Creative choices and great shakes and floats.  My son really likes the purple cow (black cherry soda and vanilla ice cream)."}
{"text":"Real cool dinner right off the  square.  I went for late lunch on a weekday.  No one there so sat right down and waitress made good recommendation.  Try the nacho dog.  The cheese was very good and the crunch from the fits was good.  The \"bun\" is really a roll and is toasted which was good and held dog together.   As for price, all regular size dogs average $2.50 so 4 dogs are $10.  Definitely worth a shot.  I would go back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"New owner and new staff make this place A LOT of fun!!! An extensive menu of great dogs too!! You will not leave unhappy!!!"}
{"text":"One great little place, out of the way, clean, family friendly and the prices are quite fair.  If you dig hot dogs any way and more than you can think of, this is the place to go.  Our entire family loves it and we left full and had cash left over.  Wish they accepted credit cards but that keeps costs down and makes it more enjoyable for us so what they heck, right?  A real nice place to eat and have a nice time.  Wish I came here more often."}
{"text":"I've been here many times. The dog options are endless. I've tried over half of the dog options and I haven't found one I didn't like yet. Thankfully they take credit cards now, I have visited more often! Insider tip: spring for the bigger dog - it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Good old fashioned fun and food.  IF you like a good hot-dogs then this is your place! It is basically the Bspot of hot-dogs. The old time look and feel of the place really makes the joint come to live. From the neon signs to the old jukeboxes, this place is half nostalgia and half gourmet. The milk shakes are a nice touch to their impressive selection of dogs as well.   For a fun lunch on the Medina square, check out Dan's Dogs!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite guilty little pleasures. :) I've tried several varieties of dogs here, and I keep coming back to the Original and the Firehouse Dogs. The original is LIKE a Chicago-style dog, minus tomatoes and poppy seed, add jalapeños. LOVE. Love, love, love. The Firehouse is a chili dog, with a bit of a kick, topped with cole slaw and a jalapeño.   I like that they use \"New England style\" buns...these are more square than a normal bun and are split down the top...and they toast the buns.  Others mentioned, and I'll reiterate...if you can dream up a way to top a hot dog, they probably have it.  Milkshakes are made with scooped ice cream on old-fashioned shake mixers, and there are quite a few options. Shakes and chocolate milk come topped with whipped cream and a choice of almonds or sprinkles. Yum. They do have malts too! :)  Great little step back in time.  Drawbacks: cash only, they sometimes close kind of early, and there can be a wait if it's a busy weekend in Medina."}
{"text":"It's with a sad hear I report that Dan's Dogs is closed as reported by the Medina Gazette on 5/31/18. Not sure why, but I hope it's only temporary. You'll be missed by many.     It's been here before and wasn't disappointed this time either. Great service even though it was a busy Saturday and the food was fantastic! I had the Boston Slaw Dog and fries with one of their famous root beer floats! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Loved Dan's Dogs!!  I couldn't decide between the Chicago-style dog and the taco-style dog... so I did both.  Plus a chocolate shake (then went back to work and slept for 2 hours).  Both were excellent, and I liked whichever I was eating at the time the best.  Dan's doesn't skimp on the toppings, and the veggies were crisp and fresh.  We arrived mere moments before the lunch crowd descended and filled every table in the joint.  In fact, there were people waiting for seats a couple of times while we were eating.  It took a little bit of time for our food to come out, but you can see the cooks hauling behind the counter, so obviously these delicious dogs take time!  Free street parking fills up fast, especially as there are other places to shop and eat on that street/in the square.  CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"So as a Medina County native that no longer lives in the area this is one of my first stops whenever I am in town.  If you are craving some cheap food or a hot dog look no further. Walk in and soak in the 1950's vibe and decor.  The food matches the mood. Mug of root beer, milkshake or a root beer float to suck down as you feast on hot dogs. With over a dozen different choices of toppings for your dogs the hardest part becomes deciding how many to eat.  Fun place to eat, very unique, cheap, and great food for the price you are paying. Service can be a bit slow so don't plan on it being a quick in and out lunch."}
{"text":"Awesome little hole in the wall with great food. I got the famous dog and the party animal. Great hot dog with fresh toppings. The place has an old school vibe to it and has great milkshakes to match it. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's a hot dog. They have horrible service and they think they are serving a prime steak. They are stingy with coupons and discourteous."}
{"text":"I'm not a big hot dog guy, but with all the additions you can add to the basic dog, I love this place!  I usually get the combo chili-kraut dog while my niece loves the pizza dog.  Everyone in the family picks their favorite. We also often order the chili-fries, which are great too. Dogs come in the regular and jumbo size and priced accordingly. There are just a few non-dog options, so go in with that in mind.  The customer service is 1st class, with a hearty \"welcome to Dan's Dogs\" as you pass through the front door. This is not a big place, so it can get bumper-to-bumper people at times, but mellow out and go with the flow and you will be fine. A fine place to eat right on the Medina Square!"}
{"text":"Good hot dogs speedily cooked & served by friendly staff at a reasonable price. They have a nice selection of dogs. My favorite is the sauerkraut and chili dog. Kraut Von Dog I think. Milkshakes look good, but I haven't tried one.   Just off the Medina square just down the block from Root Candle. Worth a try if a hot dog fan or just stopping in the area."}
{"text":"The food was good, the service friendly and efficient, and the decor takes you back to the classic diner era.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Superb family dining, my family's been going there since I can remember and I would recommend anyone try this Medina tradition. Their staff has always been friendly with top notch service every visit."}
{"text":"great food.  I had a hotdog and fries. It was very good.  there milkshakes are very good too.  Great place for a dog and fries."}
{"text":"This is a great place! Our family ate here for the first time tonight. We had hot dogs,  burgers, fries and ice chilled mugs of home made root beer. Everything was wonderful.  Prices are great too. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  The variety, the ambiance, just the character of the place is enough to keep me coming back again and again.  Some may ask \"how much can you really do with a hot dog?\"  The answer should be \"go to Dan's Dogs and find out.\""}
{"text":"Great place to get great hot dogs, fries, ice cream or shakes. The team here is very nice and the 50's theme is fun."}
{"text":"Dan's Dogs is the kind of place you go for the experience. Just off the square, this is the quintessential 50's diner, complete with black and white tiled floor, mirrored walls, paneled bar, Formica tables, and a horribly garish pink and green color scheme. It's a great place for kids-they have a collection of dog-eared toys and children's books, a vintage Pac-Man machine, and a real record-flippin' jukebox that pumps out Puff the Magic Dragon with disturbing regularity (customer choice). But don't get me wrong, I've seen adult couples come decked in full 50's regalia just to photograph themselves sipping a milkshake through two straws.  Dan's claim to fame is, of course, the wide array of hot dogs with cutesy names and topped with almost anything imaginable, from the plain Red Baron to the infamous \"Deputy Dawg\", slathered with, yes, peanut butter and jelly. While the Deputy Dawg may be only for the brave, there are dogs to suit any taste, from my personal favorite, the Pizza Dog, to the Nacho Dog and the Underdog (BLT style). And while the list of hot dogs goes on and on in tiny print, a substantial portion of the menu is also devoted to burgers, sandwiches, soups, and salads-my mom lives for the chicken taco salad. Friday nights also happen to boast perogies and all-you-can-eat fish fry. Beverage choices include a fair selection of milkshake flavors, root beer served in frosted mugs, or a personal favorite of mine, the creamsicle float with orange soda, topped with whipped cream and sprinkles.   Trust me, the service can be hit or miss, especially as it tends to get crowded on Friday nights (especially in the summer during Rally in the Alley) and Saturday afternoons, but it's generally friendly, and despite the establishment's slight wear and tear, it's a place you need to experience at least once. So bring cash, grab a seat at the bar, be adventurous with your hot dog selection-you just might find a new favorite-and play a couple songs on the jukebox. But please, lay off on Puff the Magic Dragon."}
{"text":"SERIOUSLY DIRTY!!!!  Stopped here after the Famers market on a Sat the other week and my boyfriend and I have been wanting to try it for months now. This was the most ordinary, nothing, special about it, I doubt its all beef even though they say it is hot dog Ive ever had.  Very disappointing. The Biggest problem though it this place is FILTHY!!! Every Single Thing is sticky. The tables, floors, walls, pics on the walls.... everywhere you look. The bases of the tables are covered in thick gritty brown stickiness.. We wanted to run out as soon as we sat down but figured maybe theres some amazing hot dog coming... nope, we ordered 3 diff ones and just didn't think they was good period. Definitely not for a place where this is their \"thing\" Do yourself a favor and buy the cheapest hot dogs at GE and sit on your dirty kitchen floor to eat them. You'll save money and still have a better hot dog in a cleaner place!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Dan's Dogs! Been coming here since I was a kid and the restaurant and food is still exactly the same. From hot dogs, to milkshakes, and everything in between this is my go to restaurant in Medina. My favorite meal is the BLT but the dogs are good as well. If you're ever in the area give Dan's Dogs a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent food, the setting and the service and helpful smiling faces of all who work there is awesome! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Sadly in a slow state of decline since new ownership.  Holes in the seats of the booths, slow service and constantly mixed up orders."}
{"text":"I love Dan's Dogs!  After having grown up in Medina nothing will ever compare to Dan's Dogs.  I have so many found memories of it.  The hot dogs are great along with the onion rings and fries.  You have to get one of there milk shakes!  They are amazing!  I love the jukeboxes on the tables.  It is a great place!  I encourage everyone to visit and often.  It is a true treasure of Medina."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just want a simple hot dog. Then you find yourself at Dans Dogs with a large menu of all sorts of hot dog combinations and that just makes things more complicated. Maybe it's just me...   I've been here several times and haven't been disappointed at all. I just wish they had a sample plate. I'd give them more stars if they had a sample plate..."}
{"text":"Why haven't I reviewed this place yet?  I must be trippin on Henn I guess.  This is one of the 3 reasons I drive down to Medina from Cleveland.  Place is awesome.  Old school diner and very kid friendly!  They have shakes, malts and a bunch of crazy-topped hot dogs!  Its like Happy Dog without all the hipsters and buttrockers.  Everytime I come I try a different dog and they all are great!  Lots of local pictures and local business cards hanging on the wall.  Shows this community supports eachother and thats awesome.  A reviewer said this place is \"filthy\" and I dont see it.  Its a well-worn diner but clean as far as I can see.  Stick to Cracker Park if this isn't your cup of tea.  Since I have fine-tuned my trifecta of Medina spots to hit I will break it down how it goes:  1) Park and walk the nice town square 2) Get the lil one a dog (shake optional) at Dans Dogs 3) Hit up Sullys next door for some mussels and pints 4) Get the lil one a cupcake 2 doors down if they have been good 5) Repeat as necessary"}
{"text":"Love this place! They have delicious hot dogs and amazing shakes! It's a great place to eat in if you have kids too! They have books and toys and crayons for kids to play with which I love to have for my 3 year old! I can't wait to come back again! P.S. They only take cash!!"}
{"text":"I know, how great can a hot dog be, right!? Well, let me tell you...what a fantastic experience! When you first walk in, you are immediately taken back to the 1950's; the neon lights, the pastel colors, the iconic memorabilia on the walls, and of course the jukebox playing the greatest hits of the era in the background. The staff was quick to greet us and we even had the pleasure of meeting the owner who is just as passionate about the business as the rest of the staff. Yes, the menu is filled with amazing hot dog concoctions as the name suggests, (you gotta try the Dan's Famous Dog and the Hula Dog, but take the owners word for it, top that baby with jalapenos, you wont be disappointed!). If dogs aren't your thing tho, that's ok, they have burgers, sandwiches and AUNT KAY'S BEANS! To round off the experience, we loved the homemade Root Beer, and Ice Cream (my wife and I shared a Chocolate Malt, it was like a scene straight out of Happy Days). This place just scored lifetime customers!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Medina, and moved out of state back in 2009 but often make a stop here when I visit, and it has remained unchanged. I've lived in 4 different states and 8 cities and tried a couple of similar hot dog type places, hoping to satisfy that rare but intense craving for a ridiculous hot dog but  Dan's is still the best I've had.  The floats and Shakes are awesome with real ice cream, tons of hot dog varieties, great potato pancakes and it's all cheap. This place will always be nostalgic for me. It is definitely a great date place or to take the kids, fun, causal and simple.   Just a warning though, they are cash only"}
{"text":"Tried Dan's after reading some reviews and planning a trip to Medina. It is in Downtown Medina near the Square. There is street parking and a free lot nearby.  It was busy for a Saturday evening and a few tables were waiting in front of us. They had buckets of toys for the kids to play with while they waited. We were called to sit down within 10 minutes or so. However then, 3 tables for seated after us and all of them ordered before us. No one ever came over to us and we had a little one with us. Finally my husband tracked someone down and they finally came to wait on us about 15-20 minutes after we originally sat down. Then our food took a long time to come out as well. From a service side, I wasn't impressed at all. It was a bunch of high school kids manning the front of the house, but they should have comped us an appetizer, given us a discount of something.  We ordered the double root beer float and the root beer itself was very tasty. It had a good flavor and the whipped cream on top was a hit. I ordered the chili dog, which is always my go to when trying a new hot dog joint. This chili was bad - terrible consistency and absolutely no flavor. I would not recommend. My husband got the slaw dog with chili and cole slaw on top and that was definitely better. The cole slaw was creamy and flavorful. We ordered a side of cheese fries to split. The cheese was a creamy cheese and had good flavor.   Price was a little high - hot dogs were $3.29 and $3.49. The hot dog was small. For 50 cents you could make it a jumbo. I heard people near us complaining that wasn't much larger though.  I'd try it again, but would hope for better service and definitely no chili."}
{"text":"A favorite of the kids.  Nice excuse for the adults too!  If you can think of a way to dress a hot dog, they probably have it."}
{"text":"A diner with excellent selections and service. You will leave happy and make sure you try their signature root beer,   If you are able get a table where Billy will be your server."}
{"text":"I used to love this place for years! I just went back this summer and it was terrible! They messed my order up and charged me double! There root beer taste like crap now! There summer special is a joke now!"}
{"text":"Best Hot Dog joint in Ohio Fantastic atmosphere & staff!  Paul the owner makes the place so welcoming! Definitely worth trip to Medina!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I all love Dans Dogs. Not only the food but the ATMOSPHERE! The only thing is, there's never music playing unless someone goes to the juke box. Dans Dogs would be perfect if time period music was always playing!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. You can choose from loads of hotdogs with different types of toppings. I love the Boston Slaw Dog and the Pizza Dog. 1 Jumbo or 1.5 regular dogs is great for me. No alcohol but who needs it when there is a root beer and soda fountain drinks. i see the Malts go by and only wish I could have one. Paul, the owner is super friendly, usually stops by the table and thanks you for supporting his business."}
{"text":"What Cool place.  Epic options for Hot Dogs.  Great staff and neat decor. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"A hot dog eatery that earned 5 stars from my family and me from the time we walked in off the street and were greeted warmly by the staff to the prompt delivery of our lunch despite the fact that the place was packed!  We couldn't stop smiling the entire time we were there!  Charmingly diner-like environment, fun and friendly service, delicious hot dogs, fries, soups, especially Aunt Kate's beans!  The cole slaw was the BEST I've ever tasted ever--in any restaurant on this side of the Mississippi!  We will definitely return--and soon!  Worth the 40 minute drive for us--and a great place to have lunch before touring downtown Medina including Castle Noel!"}
{"text":"This place is right on the square in Medina. The food is great every time. The employees always seem genuinely happy to be there and the owner is super friendly. We always feel welcome when we arrive and full and happy when we leave."}
{"text":"Had the original Dan's special and a Red Hot.  Both were very good.  This is exactly the type of  place I've been looking for as I travel the Midwest, and try to avoid the chain places.  Reasonably priced, fast and friendly!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Under new ownership and the changes aren't visible but they make it better.  First, they didn't change the menu!  Second, the wait was practically nonexistent.   Only a few minutes from order to service.   Finally,  they now take credit cards!  Still a fun and unique place to go!"}
