{"text":"We ordered four dishes: the puffed tendon, fried mushrooms, crawfish grits, and green garlic gnocchi. Half of the dishes (tendon, grits) were unbearably salty to the point that we could not finish them. The other two were very good. The mixed drinks were excellent. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Not impressed to say the least.  I don't really understand what the hype is all about.  Forequarter did not live up to expectations!  I started with a house made bottled drink called Paloma (tequila, lime, etc).  Not very tasty.  I've had better margaritas at a crappy Mexican restaurant.  My group also ordered the cheese/sausage platter, fried shitake mushrooms, buckwheat cavatalli, and scallops.  Mushrooms were decent.  The buckwheat cavatalli and scallops lacked flavor.  Portions are small, prices are high!  I'm ok with that if the quality is there.  This is not that place.  It is unlikely that I will try it again.    Oh, and our waiter made a stink about dividing the check.  Apparently he was above figuring out how much each person owed.  We ended up dividing the check ourselves.  Then, to make it worse, the waiter hovers over you after he swipes your credit card, and waits for your tip and signature.  (They use the Square payment method)"}
{"text":"Like the person below us with 5 stars, he sums this place up! I am a picky eater and didn't really know what some of the things were on the menu. All I have to say is I'm a changed woman! Wow! Excellent dish, dessert, and service! My husband and I will be talking about this place for a long time. It's pricey but worth it. The atmosphere is very laid back, we went in with tshirts and jeans, didn't feel out of place at all. It was an awesome touch of elegance with a home feel. Keep doing what you do best. If we're back this way ever we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Don't go here if you expect to be treated decently. My husband and I made the mistake of going here for an anniversary dinner and we had a woman named Ida for a waitress. She was extremely rude! We would ask her a question and she would just walk away. Our food order took 50 minutes to arrive. The music was so loud you could barely hear the person across from you talking. The food is just okay. It was really just a terrible experience overall."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison, likely one of the top 3, for a nice dinner and night out!! If you haven't been....go!!!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best restaurant in Madison! Amazing atmosphere, stellar drinks, and rotating menu of amazingly delicious (and usually locally-sourced) cuisine. I have gone here numerous times and had my mind blown by the food here. Often times I will be lukewarm about a potential ingredient on the menu (due to my own eccentricities), but nearly every time I end up loving any dish I get."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place get's ranked as Madison's top restaurants. The food is pretentious and completely overpriced. The place try's incredibly hard to be \"hipster\". I will admit I am not a major \"foodie\" but I simply cannot understand how it is reasonable to pay so much for tiny portions of average food. The potatoes gratin, was literally 3 marble sized lumps of potato and it was nothing spectacular. The cheese board was average and would be standard for any decent European restaurant.   Yes it's a nice setting but I don't buy in to the hype. The service was also nothing special."}
{"text":"Roasted pork--so soft it's like eating a fleshlight. Don't really like giving stars during restaurants first week. Really, really good food and drinks."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE:  Very warm and inviting, with a sort of \"cobbled together\" look with lots of wood, some taxodermy (including a giant black bear) and dimmed lighting.  I'd say this is a great place for a date but if they are busy, don't expect a quiet conversation.  DRINKS:  Decent prices with beers ranging from $4.50-6, wine $6-9, mixed drinks $6-9.  We had a cup of their Riesling for $8 and I have to tell you that it was probably the best Riesling I've ever had.  The pours are also very generous, which I can appreciate.  They serve Death's Door, which is always amazing, I suggest you try it.  *food* PRICE: $6-19, not bad with vegetarian/cheese plates being in the lower range and meats hanging around the $12 range, the most expensive $19 was a half chicken but it is, afterall, a half chicken. PORTIONS:  My partner and I each got one plate and while it wouldn't be enough to fill us up, we were able to share everything and we both got to taste everything several times.  This is great, as some places you get one or two pieces of meat and that's it, one bite, then you're done if you're sharing (no fun). PRESENTATION: Most dishes are served on a cutting board, which is very fitting with the decor while others are served on nicely trimmed china.  You're served with a side plate to place food bits on which is great for sharing meals.  The plates are arranged well with many colors to be visually appealing.  TASTE:  The balance is great, if you like pickled items.  Most plates have a main focus point of protein of either cheese or meat and then either a salad or pickled array with a sauce of some sort.  We had the special of the day, lamb copa, which is similar to prosciutto, served with mustard, crostini, and pickled items including daikon radish and Lion's head mushrooms, and the roasted carrot dish.  They should not include the carrot tops but do, so you have to cut the tops off, which is annoying. The overall taste of the two dishes was totally worth the price.  SERVICE: It's pretty good, the waitstaff is patience and very laid back.  You won't get interrupted here at all.  Great date place, always fill up your water/drinks.  SUGGESTIONS;  The only improvement I would make would be to have a pairing for drinks with the meals because they are very interesting and unique.  I'd love to know what to drink with these meals and for how \"foodie\" it is, this should come standard.  LOVED IT! =)"}
{"text":"Disappointed with the tiny drinks we got. Very pretty, but very small. The charcuterie plate was  very good, but we weren't entirely sure what we were eating because the restaurant was so noisy and the waitress seemed annoyed with our questions. The ravioli, which was delicious, had exactly four pillows. We left the place extremely hungry and made a food run right after we left."}
{"text":"Oh, Forequarter, how I love thee...  I am thrilled to have Forequarter in my neighborhood. The first time I went with a group of friends and split a bunch of things, which is a great way to do it without spending a fortune. My husband and I went there for the first time together for our anniversary and splurged. Well, we got addicted and can't stop going back. It works for both of us, because although we are pretty adventurous, I don't eat red meat or pork, and they offer many vegetarian options most of the time.  I had possibly my favorite ice cream ever there during the summer -- fennel ice cream. So unusual but amazing. Their desserts are generally out of this world. Save room to share one with a friend, at the very least.   My only slightly negative experience was a few weeks ago when we went there on a Tuesday after a snowstorm. I don't know if it was because it was a weeknight, or because there was a snowstorm, but the menu was way more out there than usual. There were no vegetarian entrees, and few vegetarian options whatsoever. I tried duck heart meatballs, which were WAY too gamey for me.   I also highly recommend their special drinks -- I've had several that were amazing and boozy."}
{"text":"Amazing local farm produce and meat expertly prepared. Never a bad meal from the ever changing menu."}
{"text":"With five-ish candelit tables positioned around an upscale bar, Forequarter doubles as a date-worthy dinner destination and classy cocktail stop. The intimate environment is balanced with plenty of space between tables and large windows opening to East Johnson.  There isn't a thing on the menu that I've tried and didn't like. As for beverages, while the German Shepherd is pricey, it's a unique drink well worth the expense (both in flavor and alcohol content); the Hemingway Daquiri makes a close second. I'd steer clear of the B-A-N-A-N-A-S unless you're actually bananas for that flavor."}
{"text":"Good drinks, good food and taxidermy.  Typically I'd say that 2/3 works for me, but 3/3 = number ONE! Good job Madison, WI. Not disappointed at all, not in the slightest for a quick decision for dinner after a conference."}
{"text":"Six of us were so excited to celebrate birthdays at Forequarter.  The food was just horrible. Two of us had the goat sausage stuffed cappelletti that was so tough and salty that it was basically inedible.  The poached trout was cold, the $34 pork chop was 80% fat, the trout beignets were over fried. Our wait person was cordial but not concerned that our dinner was a disaster. What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation on Sunday. They sat our reservation over 30 minutes late. Then they served us not one, but TWO raw meat dishes. Forequarter Host, if the kitchen can't handle all the guests, DON'T give out a reservation. Instead, the restaurant punished us for having a late res, even though it was the restaurant who made us wait about 45 minutes after our reservation before we could order. So incredibly disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for dinner in Madison. I've made multiple visits here, and I've had some exceptional dishes, namely the quail, pork belly, rillete, and cavatelli (they often have some version of these on their menu). They Butcher their own meat, and you can taste the difference. At the same time, I've also been disappointed. I've been served food that was either boring (skate wing to name one) or lackluster (mushroom app), which is not acceptable for what this place is trying to be. With that said, this place has some of the boldest food in Madison and that deserves recognition. Dessert is pretty good, too."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner service tonight! This was our first time there, and it exceeded expectations, pushing its way to the top of our Madison best list.   Their menu changes often, but we a couple of cocktails (a special of the day and a margarita). Both were good.   For food, we got the fried shiitake mushrooms, pork belly, and trout. They were each phenomenal. The flavor combinations were creative yet go well together. We were impressed by each.   We ended with the dark chocolate polenta cake, sugared ginger, and house made ice cream. It was unique but not my favorite part of the meal.   The atmosphere was well thought out, though a bit dark. Our waitress was knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive. One of the parts my husband and I appreciated the most was that she ran our credit card at the table so there was no end of meal waiting time, which is a part of the meal that can kill the good momentum if the wait is too long.   All in all, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wonderful, wonderful meal. One of the best we have had in Madison.  Here they seat you at whatever opens first: a table or the bar. I would describe it as formal food, informal atmosphere. On a Saturday night quite late, people were in tennis shoes and tshirts as well as more business casual-like attire. Nobody cared. Hipster paradise, indeed! We were more dressed up but didn't stand out.  Looks like everything they have is made in house, and while it is a higher priced restaurant, it is worth the high price for the level of thought and quality.   We opted for a cheese plate, appetizer, small meat plate, entree and dessert to share between two people. Their menu changes a lot, and it was a couple weeks since we were there, so I don't remember the exact names of the plates, but the cheese plate had a blue cheddar with amazingly toasted pecans, lovely honey, and lemony jam. Out appetizer were amazing meatballs. The small plate was a lamb pasta dish, and the entree was the beef tongue. We ordered the tongue based on prior reviews, and it was delicious,  however the lamb was the winning plate in my opinion, so the tongue just didn't compare.  We will absolutely return!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure whether Forequarter would be for me or not. I don't eat meat or dairy, and it seemed like the sort of restaurant that would focus heavily on Wisconsin's local meat and dairy products.   I was happily surprised to find a number of vegetarian appetizer options and an entree option that were either dairy free or could easily be made so. Fried mushrooms were excellent, rich in texture and flavor, and the potato salad was tasty.   The market vegetables and heirloom beans came with ricotta but I asked for that to be left off. The server immediately offered to swap sauces on the dish if I needed a dairy free meal, which was thoughtful. It wasn't immediately apparent that the usual sauce had butter in it, but she had my back.   The gracious service was the highlight of the meal, followed by the beautiful decor and classy ambiance. My food was tasty, but overall I prefer the brighter flavors and vegetables at Lao Laan Xang or Bunky's. If anyone wants to go out for a finer dining experience, however, I'll definitely recommend we head to Forequarter."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying I really wanted this place to be great since I had heard rave reviews about it.  My husband and I decided to go for our anniversary dinner.  We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived on a Saturday night that it wasn't too packed and were seated right away.  They sat us at the bar, but we had our own server ( in hindsight I wish we could've just ordered from the bartender).  We ordered our drinks - my husband a martini and since I'm pregnant our server suggested an awesome lime juice and soda with a spicy rimmed glass.  We also ordered our food since we were ready to order.  All was great until that point.  We then waited 45 minutes for our salads to show up.  I had to ask the server if our salads were coming with our meal or separately.  He never came to fill up our water and never asked if we wanted another drink.  When the sun set it got very dark in the restaurant and I couldn't see what I was eating. There was a large group of people who were so loud, it made the entire restaurant noise level rise and was unpleasant.  Our entree came about 20 minutes after our salads and at that point my husband asked for a glass of wine with dinner.... took another 10 minutes for that to show up.  The food was good, not amazing and unfortunately if the service had been better I would've probably gave the restaurant a 4 and I'm tempted to give them a 2 because I was so unhappy when I left.  My husband ordered the sausage platter and I think they could've come up with a more visually pleasant plating.  I would suggest putting it on a cutting board. It looked and tasted like something I could bar b q in my back yard.  I can't tell you what my gnocchi looked like because it was so dark I could hardly tell what I was eating.  We probably will not go back.  The menu wasn't too exciting and I don't think I should be treated so poorly when I'm paying $100 for dinner.    Pro: - Food. We had the bib salad with sliced radishes and parsnips and the special salad that came with shaved duck prosciutto.  For entree I had the gnocchi (7 out of 10) and my husband had the sausage platter (which was about a 5 out of 10).  - my non alcoholic drink was very refreshing and not too sweet - hostess was very nice - love the decor, outdoor seating  Con: -service.  So unfortunate because it looked like everyone else was receiving wonderful service.  Our server never even asked us if we wanted dessert, never brought us more water and never asked us how our meal was. He either was very busy (I didn't think it was that busy in the restaurant) or we weren't a priority. - Noise Level - lighting - my husband's martini was basically a shot of vodka with a glass of olive juice.  I would not recommend the dirty martini"}
{"text":"2nd visit.  Excellent food, very small portions and terrible seating arrangements! Its a very small place. We called ahead for a party of 3. There were two tables of 2 finishing up, and rather than put it together to seat us,  they sat 2 parties of 2. I guess they want the two tables of tips!!! We were forced to wait for a party of 8 to finish.....it's 30 mins and still counting"}
{"text":"Worst service we've had in Madison. The wait was bad, but they don't have reasonable accommodations nor do they take reservations, so prepare to awkwardly wait around. The appetizers were great and their beers were good. But they ran out of some of the menu options and were completely rude about it. Even the manager made an effort to tell us how this happens and we should be ok with it. They knew we were upset and didn't care. Food was stupidly expensive for the amount. A dinner for 4 cost $180 which is fine but we had to go eat after that. Only 1 of the 4 meals was great. Just completely overrated place, dlux or pig in a fur are 5 times better."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 10 stars. We recently had some foodie friends in from Chicago, and they LOVED this place. One of my friends has a nut allergy and she was elated to discover how professionally they handled everything. So well, in fact, she was able to share all of the plates with the group and get a couple of drinks without any concern. Forequarter truly is a gem."}
{"text":"Best food in Madison hands down. I'd never think to visit the city without eating here. Their approach to food is elegant and straightforward and their bar menu is the most creative in town. I wish there was a Forequarter in New York!"}
{"text":"Truly the best food I've had in Madison, I await any excuse to dine here. Over the course of three separate visits, I've always come away feeling completely blown away by their execution of \"farm to table\" food. Their menu always consists of down right delicious classics to more intellectual dishes--never sacrificing on flavor. They do a lot in house: from butchering, making charcuterie, and producing their own tonic water. That attention to detail shows in everything from the food to the service. All of that coupled with the fact that their cocktail program and wine list are always on point, makes me a fan."}
{"text":"Foodie from out of town must in Madison. Interesting concept of collective (meaning no main chief) however incredible fusion of tastes and pairings. Main focus meat hence the name but enough vegetarian options for those folks. Only thing that prevented a 5 star was the wait staff who seemed not engaged and needed to go in back to get answers about the menu. However, if you are a foodie in Madison I would not miss it!"}
{"text":"We live a few blocks away and if I could afford to eat here 2-3 times a week I would. The menu is constantly changing but the dishes are consistently excellent. Recent standouts were the scallops and the hangar steak...  They've also got some great craft cocktails - I recommend the \"Smoky Old Pal\" (or similar name, it's a combination of a Sazerac with some Campari and other ingredients).  Best for small groups as the place is rather small, or plan to come late."}
{"text":"Quail was quite good and the sauce accompanying it was delicious. Beef tongue entree was also quite interesting. the tongue itself was tasty- salty, fatty, and good. However, the sauce was a bit bland and the potatoes accompanying the beef tongue were cold (intentionally). Overall, the beef tongue dish was good but not great. Cocktails were very inventive and unique. However, I cannot say they were the tastiest drinks I have ever had. There were a ton of layers of flavors though and both cocktails we tried were most definitely interesting. Entrees were under 20$ and cocktails under $10. From an east coast big city perspective, I would expect to pay at least $45 for the beef tongue and scotch based cocktail, so while I understand this may be expensive for Madison, I thought it was a great value."}
{"text":"A glowy, special, expensive-but-worth-it dining experience.  It gets loud in there people, so be aware if your friend / date has any kind of hearing loss - it is really hard to hear when the place is packed, and it is almost always packed.  I've been multiple times and each time there is something new and delicious to discover. No reservations so best to get there early. And DEFINITELY get the mushrooms if they are on the menu."}
{"text":"If you like out of the ordinary food and creative creations, this is for you, a foodies wonderland! Presentation was great, atmosphere inviting and warm, wait staff well educated, and they had a great offering of creative and tasty drinks. As a non-meat eater, the menu was meat heavy but there were plenty of other options. The butter poached cod was melt in your mouth and not greasy; the mushroom plate was splendid, the fluke ceviche was out of this world. Definitely worth the trip. A little hard to find without a sign, so keep your eyes open!"}
{"text":"Why 5 stars?  In short, the amazingly crafted food and warm staff stand out from the rest of the crowd in Madison (and beyond).  Let me start off by saying that I've been around the world, and have found the Wisconsin palette to be solidly focused on cheese, bread, and beer.  All fine food groups.  But I also want fine dining that takes advantage of the amazing Wisconsin produce Wisconsin farmers are growing.  Forequarter has seized on this opportunity.  For example, when I visited last Friday I got the \"market vegetables in lemon broth\".  Great, vegetables in water.  Big whup.  But the chefs at Forequarter transformed this simple dish to highlight the fresh flavors of the vegetables, added herbs and spices which complemented things with depth.  Such a simple dish, but so memorable.  This same approach can be seen with the fried mushrooms with black garlic.  If you come here and could only get one thing, make it this dish.  So meaty, such a deep flavor.  It would make a carnivore vegetarian.  I travel every year to Madison and have this dish (and an amazing entrée).    I'm not exaggerating, this is one of the best quality restaurants I've ever been to, anywhere (and it's also NOT stuffy!).  The ambience and staff - like the essence of the food - is genuine, straight forward, and down to earth.  Wisconsin hospitality without the innocence.  Love this place.  Keep doing what you're doing!"}
{"text":"I am giving this place five stars for their incredible beet dish and for that alone!  I have always had wonderful times at Forequarter and love the warmth of the place.  The drinks are great, the food is fabulous, and the service is impeccable.  So very in love with this place."}
{"text":"Sorry, but this place is overrated.   Lackluster so-called heirloom tomato salad used tasteless tomatoes and did nothing on the plate or in the mouth.  Why bother?  Carrot cavatelli was the best dish and it was pretty good. Roasted eggplant mushroom thing was interesting.  Dessert tried too hard and failed to impress.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Really great food in a casually hip and rustic setting.  We thoroughly enjoyed ouselves last night!  We shared a wheel of cheese to begin with - I forget where it came from however it was rather brie like and was wrapped in birch bark.  It was served with vanilla scented peach compote, hazelnuts, and some delicious bread.  A wonderfully decandent way to start our meal.  For a main course I enjoyed veal meatballs served with lima beans, tomato, and greens and my wife enjoyed the squash cavatelli.  The waitress was very nice - laid back but yet very knowledgeable.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Wow! Great food! Great customer service! I sat at the bar so it was fun to watch the goings on in the back. I did nit have the Boar porterhouse, but it looked and smelled amazing!!! I heard that the patron raved about it. This joint is definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"Forequarter is definitely among the best restaurants in Madison. Everything was perfect the night we were in. We will be going back often."}
{"text":"Their motto should be \"come hungry, leave hungry and broke\". I experienced two of my dining pet peeves here: eating on top of your neighbor/no personal space and tiny serving sizes (with ridiculous prices). Gave it a shot but have no reason to go back. Had to go home and eat leftovers to fill up :("}
{"text":"Superb meal from start to finish. Highlights = the sweetcorn, the polenta, and the fried mushrooms. Great service, great atmosphere. If we lived in Madison we'd be regulars here!"}
{"text":"The food portions are somewhere between true tapas and enough-for-one, but the prices are slightly higher than expected for the area. The butter poached scallops were delicious, but the monkfish ceviche, smoked salmon, and fried shiitake mushrooms were just ok. The decor was friendly, relaxed, and well-lit, but there was barely enough room to walk between the tables.  Generally acceptable and lots of \"buts\" = 3 stars."}
{"text":"Beautiful and cozy space, fantastic drinks, and delicious vegetarian options. Go now, before you need to book reservations weeks out!"}
{"text":"I am giving this five stars for the Madison area only since it is easily the best restaurant in the city.  That would still leave it behind a lot of places in Chicago, for instance, but I want to recognize it for what it is.  Which is excellent.  First visit was merely good.  Second visit was astounding with every dish bringing novel flavors and perfect execution.  We opened with some beets marinated in coffee.  I loved it, but there were only four beets...  There was also something that looked like ground coffee, but was also tasty.  Sadly, I can't recall the menu.  Next was a fish chowder. Not really a soup, but a light sauce on some fish and other meats/vegetables that was only vaguely akin to your normal clam chowder.  Our main courses were a quail preparation on a sweet potato puree and a hanger steak with sweetbreads.  The former came with two purees actually, but I  can't recall the other.  They were dark and white and when mixed together were downright transcendent.  The quail was perfectly cooked as well.  It was the better of the two entrees.  The hanger steak was very interesting, but the weird flavors coming off of it were very close to breaching bad.  It ended up working and I quite liked the sweetbread, but it was the weakest dish of the night.  Then comes dessert.  I was initially nonplussed by the offerings.  The panna cotta/ creme brulee line of desserts is a bit overdone and I am not going to order a platter of mundane sounding cookies.  However, my wife ordered a Kouign Amann.  I am so glad she did.  Kouign Amann is a pastry you can easily mess up, in particular making it too bready.  Not the case here.  Perfect caramelization all over the top and a flaky muffin bottom full of apple compote.  Dessert clinched it for me.  Best place in Madison to eat.  I sincerely hope the Kouign Amann stays on the dessert menu."}
{"text":"Thanks for the amazing meal and service last Saturday evening. This is a hidden gem in Madison."}
{"text":"I came here with high hopes: the menu looked amazing, the atmosphere was lovely, and the staff was--seemingly, it turns out--helpful and knowledgable. I'd been told they accommodated dietary needs, which was sadly not the case.   I have a severe gluten allergy, and their menu seemed to have a great variety of dishes that would work. Unfortunately, the server informed me that making any changes to their dishes was, in fact, impossible, leaving a few paltry appetizers or one of the main dishes available to me. I asked why the salmon dish was not gluten-free, seeing as none of the ingredients should have wheat in it,  but the server told me the gnocchi was dusted with flour. I asked if the gnocchi could just be left  off the dish.   And, for some unknown reason, they refused. Not because they couldn't, or because they were worried about my safety, but because doing so would just \"ruin the aesthetics of the dish.\"   The food I ended up getting was not only disappointing, but actually was not cooked properly and didn't even taste good. The only worthwhile thing there was the cheese board.  If you want to eat at a place where the pursuit of pretension wins out over letting a customer eat, go here."}
{"text":"Overpriced, small portions for food and drink, crowded, noisy, and dark.  You can get equal or better food elsewhere for less money in a more pleasant environment.  I have no idea how this place stays in business."}
{"text":"The servers, including the bartenders, know the menu very well, the menu changes with the seasons, and the plates themselves are nicely paired. Pricey, but worth it for a well-portioned meal and unique cocktails. Drink menu extensive. The bartender Sally served us at the bar and was well-versed, courteous, and attentive. Hugely recommended!"}
{"text":"This was an outstanding dining experience! The food as well as the service was top notch. I highly recommend the Old Fashioned bourbon cocktail and the green bean dish. Delicious."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food. I had a whitefish dish that was excellent. But one of my co-diners has the sausage platter and I had serious food envy. If you are a meat eater I would recommend that."}
{"text":"Warm and cozy atmosphere - very comfortable place to be.  I was with a difficult group; we must have driven the \"maître d\" and our server crazy but they handled it with no outward expression of the exasperation they surely felt, very courteous and professional."}
{"text":"Wow. Wow, wow, wow!  We walked in on a Thursday night after finding this place on Yelp, and scored a table for two right by the fan during the hottest week of the summer. Alyssa, our server, was highly attentive to our allergies: nuts and gluten. The menu changes with some regularity, but we enjoyed and would recommend the following: Fried shiitake mushrooms with sprouted lentils and pickled Serrano peppers, the salad with turnips and radishes, porterhouse pork chop (enough for two), and the special that evening - coffee-roasted beets with baby greens and buttermilk ice cream.  Everything we tasted was better than what came before it, and dessert was no exception: the creamiest fennel ice cream with flaky orange cookies was fresh, unexpected and the perfect finish.   Craft Cocktails and a well-planned wine list?  They've got you covered there too. Aperitifs and digestifs?  Yup. Try the Clear Creek Williams pear brandy if you enjoy unique."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Forequarter twice, and I am fairly certain this restaurant has the best food and the best service in Madison.  Every item I have had has been excellent and the menu changes constantly. While they are extremely able when it comes to butchering and processing their own meat, the Underground Kitchen team can also make veggies an absolute delight. I've enjoyed a variety of chartuterie and cheese boards.  One item that was ordered at my table both instances was the veal meatballs. They were fantastic both times, but totally different sizes with different sides and sauces. They were tender and with a wonderful flavor.   The specialty cocktails are some of the best in town, though they also change often. Wine list was good and reasonably priced and wine service was perfect.  Overall service has been stellar -- servers have been friendly and very knowledgeable about the ever-changing menu."}
{"text":"Best meal we've eaten in Madison and we've tried to eat at all the best. Can't even describe the tastes and unique food here. Make a reservation."}
{"text":"Lovely meal and cocktails.  The space is a little cramped and the presentations a little fussy, but I hope to return."}
{"text":"The best food I have had in a long time.   Classy fun great atmosphere great drinks and food highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Warning - you may want to lick your plate after you are done eating. Delicious food! The restaurant is an asset to the neighborhood. They took over an old stereo/dj store that was going out of business. It does tend to get very packed and noisy. Not a good place for big groups. It has a nice bar, huge ice cubes and great attention to detail in making the cocktail."}
{"text":"This fall, I was determined to try this place after learning about the Madison food force that is the Underground Food Collective. I'm happy I did.  Other reviews warned me that there was no sign on the building, so I was worried about finding it on East Johnson. Turns out it's right across the street from the Self Serve Laundromat/Caribou Tavern, with a 708 1/4 number sign on it.   It's an intimate spot, so go here with someone you like. My boyfriend and I snagged the last spot just before 6 on a Friday night, which was basically part of the bar counter that faced the wall on stools, one lit candle. Constantly bumping elbows, hard for the wait staff to get at us to take our order.   The food, however, really hit the spot. We splurged on the ripped bread, which was an $11 loaf of delicious bread stuffed with cheese, chopped garlic, and scallions. I had the poussin (young chicken), and it was the best roasted chicken I've ever eaten. Juicy and tender with fresh carrots and spiced potatoes. Cherry bread pudding for dessert was homey, simple, and full of tart Door County cherries.  The most surprising part about our meal was the drinks. I ordered an amaretto sour but was informed that they didn't have sour. I said that was fine and forgot about it, only to have the waitress come back later with a similar drink. \"The bartender got excited,\" she said, as she passed me the glass. I can't quite remember what ingredients they used to make a mock amaretto sour, but there were cherry almond-ish and orange flavors, and it was really quite good. I was pretty impressed.  In sum: go early, bring money, bring a friend you can be cozy with, and don't be afraid to get creative with the bar staff."}
{"text":"The best meal of my life. They are amazing for local food that means more than just a dinner out. Drinks were amazing and the food was most expertly made with simple elements that made for the perfect compote. I would recommend this restourant to the endth degree."}
{"text":"Overpriced, undersized and bland dishes. Nice atmosphere masks unimaginative recipes."}
{"text":"Others will gush in more detail.  I will simply say that this was one of the best meals I've had in years. I ate by myself at the bar, had a beer and ordered the pork porterhouse. It was unbelievable: well-cooked, well-seasoned, and paired with cabbage and potatoes. So good.  I could go on about mouthfeel and all that, but it was just excellent ingredients prepared with exceptional care and skill. I may go again tomorrow night...  Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!   Everyone has been raving about this restaurant for the past year.  They don't take reservations except on Sunday so there's always an obnoxiously long wait.  With so many other great dining choices in Madison I've never wanted to stand in line for food.  My mother-in-law, who is in the know about al things good, thought I should try it out so she made a reservation for Sunday for the family.  Turns out 5:30 was the only slot 6 of us could get in.  We arrived on time and were the only ones in the place (which is quite small) until about 7:00 when others started to arrive.  OK, 5:30 is about an hour and a half before we normally like to dine, but we had the place to ourselves.  You would think we would get extra special attention.  Not so.  The waitress barely noticed us and even needed to be reminded about drinks that were ordered. Enough about the bad service.  Now on to the menu.  Or I should say, non-menu.  I don't know what people think is so great about this place.  There were very few items on the menu I felt were interesting. (It was a rather short list).  Other than the vegetable dishes, I really didn't know what to order until the server told us about the specials - fried chicken!  Wow, I NEVER order chicken in a restaurant because I make it so much at home.  Oh well, nothing else seemed interesting so I ordered it, with a vegetable dish on the side (extra $, of course).  It wasn't terrible, but not much to rave about.  I don't think I'd go back for it.  As a matter of fact, I don't think I'll go back at all. Madison is a great restaurant town.  So many great choices.  I don't know how this one can make it with such great competition."}
{"text":"After just lambasting Gates & Brovi for a limited menu, I turn to Forequarter with my ultimate praise. Even though there are limited selections, they are varied, contain fresh, high-quality local ingredients, and are prepared with care.   The drinks are sublime. Interesting cocktails on trend, each more delicious than the next. Try anything off the ginger menu if that is your think. The apple cider drink is phenom, and the lime gimlet is just right - with just enough tang to be refreshing, but no puckering.  The food is served on wooden boards, much like the former Underground Kitchen, but it seems whatever kinks they had with the menu items (from my recollection) have been worked out now. Every morsel was delicious, and I ate to my hearts (belly's) content without feeling heavy.   I'll be back, and soon. Forequarter may give my Madison favorite (Brasserie V) a run for their money."}
{"text":"The price point for the portion is really the only complaint. It seems they could double the plate for the same price and not be hurting for profit margin.  I would recommend doing three appetizers over an entree for this one reason.  Otherwise the food itself and its preparation is excellent in Every way.  Our server wasn't particulalry friendly or receptive but all the other staff was very receptive and truly caring.  The space itself is the perfect size and I do indeed recommend this estallishment."}
{"text":"I was visiting from Chicago and made it a huge point of my visit to eat here. I was not let down in the least. The fact that there aren't reservations is a little annoying for how popular it is but I'm sure it's to preserve the right crowd.   Anyway everything we got was amazing beyond words. The braunschweiger toast melted in your mouth. The squash was so savory and rich, the desert was so complex and deep. Loved the experience and definitely will go back when I am in town."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a drink so they weren't serving full menu.  Had the pretzels which were amazing.  The thing that really amazed me was the drink menu.  Half of the ingredients I hadn't heard of but had to try.  We had a group of 4, each ordered 2 drinks, all were different and we passed them around to get a sampling.  All of them were innovative, delicious, and served in a variety of glassware.  Would absolutely recommend this place to anyone who loves a great cocktail, plus the ambiance was just so damn cool."}
{"text":"I just had the lake trout and my wife had the flat iron steak. Unbelievable! Great booze and atmosphere"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. Great bar. Very creative cocktails. Haven't had a drink I didn't like. Food is creative and full of flavor. It's a shame we don't have one of these in LA."}
{"text":"Dinner at Fore1/4 was a major objective during my recent visit to Madison and it fulfilled my high expectations. The menu is friendly to meatlovers and vegetarians, and offers a nice selection of shareable appetizers, salads, entrees, and desserts featuring locally sourced and house-made ingredients at reasonable prices. And while every component of every dish rocks the quality meter, the whole is always greater than sum of the parts. The cocktail, beer, wine, and digestif selections are outstanding as well. The staff is enthusiastic, helpful, and knowledgeable. The onelydownside is the size of Fore1/4, which makes it hard to eat there as often as and when you would like, but it is definitely worth the wait if you can find room to enjoy a drink. On the bright side, Underground is opening a new place at 811 Williamson, which I believe will include a butcher shop and dining."}
{"text":"I have been to Forequarter dozens of times and damn if it doesn't up its own ante every time. The ever-rotating menu is one of my favorite things about the place- even as a semi-regular, there is always a new inventive cocktail or tasty dish to try.  Pros: - I have never had poor service at Forequarter.   -Their wine list and craft cocktail menu top any other in Madison.  -The sausage platter (my go-to) which can include anything from smoked beef sausage to lamb merguez with crispy fingerling potatoes and perfectly salted baby sorrel leaves.  -The dainty sterling steak knives, the legendary cutting boards, the little silver dishes and trays, yeah, I'm a hipster, you called it. Forgive me. It's adorable. I feel like I'm at my best friend's rehearsal dinner. -The trout with roe and sauteed radishes. Are you kidding me with this? so good. -Alcoholic slushies served in Weck jars.  -Ripped bread/whipped butter. rhythmically delish. -They don't always offer great desserts, but when they're on, oh, it's on. Last time I was there, I got housemade mint icecream, showered with housemade butter brickle sprinkles and backyard mint chiffonade, buttressed with some of the best shortbread cookies I've ever had.  -My tween kiddo declared their smoked beef cheek with green tomato relish and garlic confit \"One of the top ten meals of my life. Maybe better than sushi.\" Show me another restaurant that can convert a tween into a beef cheek aficionado?  Right, didn't think so.  -Portion sizes. Appropriate for one's appetite and the price.  Cons: -I feel like I can't go anywhere else.  -The AC doesn't always keep up.  -Always a wait.   I can't think of any other cons.  Just go here, drink the best Dark and Stormy in town while you wait for your table, and then sit down, check out how good your date looks in their flawless [candle]lighting, and prepare to gorge yourself until you get high on food."}
{"text":"Five stars for service, two for food...and since this is a restaurant, food weighs down the average rating. We called ahead and reserved two spots at the bar, which was a great move since the place is tiny and was full for Sunday dinner. Our bartender / waitress was sweet, helpful and knowledgeable and did everything in her power to help us have a good experience. Ultimately, though, things like the kitchen are out of her reach.   Our first wine, from a vineyard we've visited in France and were super excited to see on the menu, was somehow off. Not sure what happened but probably something in transit. Even after we gave it a few minutes to get some air, the bartender and the sommelier / owner both tasted it and agreed, so we scrapped it and tried a different wine, with much better results. Great by the glass options and prices, by the way, as long as the wines aren't bottleshocked.   For the first course we ordered the cheese platter -- Manchester goat from VT with local honey, bread and Meyer lemon marmalade -- and the pickled trout with celeriac mayo, trout roe and shaved radish. The cheese platter was awesome and paired well with the honey. I liked the trout but fiancé felt the different flavors were too strong and didn't balance -- too much tart + bitter and not enough subtlety. But overall well-intentioned.   The second course, though, was really difficult. I ordered the market veggies with housemade ricotta and lemon broth. The bartender vouched for it and said she used to prepare this dish as a prep cook. Well...the prep cook should have checked if all the veggies were actually cooked. Specifically the beans. You can't eat uncooked beans without really uncomfortable consequences. So I ate a couple of sliced beets and other root veggies with ricotta, about five bites in total, and left a pile of oily, raw kidney beans swimming in the flavorless broth. Really unfortunately especially for a  $16 dish. Fiancé had the cavatelli with lamb and carrot. What arrived was a brown dish with a fried bird's nest of spiralized carrot on top. Literally brown. With lamb, malt, mushrooms, hop oil, and carrots, you would think that this dish would have layers of flavor and interest. But the predominant flavor was that of canned beef broth. Odd.   Again, the bartender was really kind and probably noticed we were underwhelmed, because she gave us two excellent chocolate-bourbon macarons on the house. A delicious ending, but we really couldn't reconcile the attentiveness of the front of house with the carelessness of the kitchen."}
{"text":"At times Forequarter is painfully trendy. I once ordered a deconstructed salad that came as an entire lettuce head, grilled, with a meager portion of salad dressing. At times Forequarter can verge on sheer genius, like when they served me a blackened pork belly I will never forget.   Hiding in a signless brick building on E Johnson, Forequarter is a neat little restaurant with adventurous chefs and an ever changing seasonal menu. It also might be the most inconsistent restaurant I've been to. Sometimes the meals are amazing and sometimes their just alright. And for the prices that Forequarter demands, it's always slightly insulting when a new recipe doesn't cut it (i'm looking at you grilled lettuce!)   This restaurant has one of the best cocktail menus in town though. Very fun and inventive stuff (I've never had celery soda before). Their menu on Christmas day is supposedly legendary, but I've never been able to get there early enough for a table."}
{"text":"Great service. Bartenders & servers are very informative and they know exactly what they're talking about! Total experts!! Try their Moscow mule it's to die for. Oh and they have awesome beer selections. Their late night food is affordable & super delicious!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and drink. Intimate setting and decor. Menu changes often with local ingredients. Very small and does not take reservations so go early to put your name in and grab a seat at the bar (also very small) and be ready to wait over some of the best cocktails in the city."}
{"text":"So...it turns out that I'll eat anything served in a Weck jar.  Pork rillette, cocktails or whatever they're dishing up.  It's just so damn cute.  Forequarter has a pretty small menu consisting of some starter-esque boards/plates, salads, and a few mains.  Everything is super easy to share.  You can't go wrong if you start with a meat and/or a cheese board, a salad or two, and one of the mains. I recommend always getting one of the sausage dishes if that's your thing.  These guys know their meats (and their veggies too). If you have a hard time deciding, ask your server or trust in the specials; I've never had a bad experience.  One little gripe: I always run out of bread.  However, just tell your server and they're more than happy to bring over a little more.  Forequarter is pretty much packed from the second they open, but the wait is worth it.  If you can't handle the wait for a table, do yourself a favor and grab one of their amazing, inventive cocktails. I always have a good time at Forequarter and love going when the menu gets an overhaul."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great atmosphere and staff.   We were visiting from Los Angeles and weren't feeling any of the restaurants on the square [including the most expensive one - my fiancé is very 'particular'..]. We were stoked to find Forequarter off the main drag -- the food rivaled the trendy farm to table we get out here. Creative cocktails with rustic ice [big blocks w/out bubbles!], perfectly cooked fish, my fiancé could cut his meat with a spoon [think it was a pork thing, which I clearly don't eat] and we're still talking about the cacao nib beet dish. We each had two cocktails, ordered a bit more food than we could manage [but ate it all..] and walked/ rolled out of there for under a hundo [far cry from LA prices..].  Highly recommended - would love to check out their new menu."}
{"text":"They need to learn how to write a menu. Ordered the herring with cantaloupe. Struggled to find the herring. I will stop there with the food. The decor is terrible, the ventilation is awful. A couple that was sitting a few tables down complained of the smell of burning. Someone in the kitchen clearly not knowing what they are doing and they just pretended like it is normal. This place can be summarized as a bunch of clueless \"young creatives\" thinking they know how to put a meal together. Sure some of the dishes are ok but given the setting, execution, and service of this place I don't think they can command the prices they list. Not authentic or worthwhile at all. Avoid at all costs. There are so many great options in Madison this is not one of them."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, when a date was treating, so I didn't pay a lot of attention to cost.  We each had a cocktail and shared a bottle of wine before ordering food. I can't remember much about what we each ordered, but I was really excited by the food. A of foodie-type places in Madison are pretentious to the detriment of the food, which quickly becomes overpowered by conflicting spices and flavors.  But here, it all seemed to work well. They knew when to pull back and when to dive in.  We also shared a plate of cookies for dessert. Even the cookies that contained ingredients I usually avoid, like coconut, were amazing.  And if you don't finish your wine, you can cork it to go. Hooray!"}
{"text":"Wow... I believe! I believe! I believe in the power of food love!  This place is phenomenal! Just go here. Suggest small group (2-4) and go early around 5:30 - 6 pm on weekday or 5 pm weekend. Make it a 2 hour dinner journey to engage everything. And try to sit at the bar (group of 2). the bartenders are very helpful and quick: water, menus, alcohol, food. She held our hand for my lactose issues (described the entire menu and which items could be without milk products) and suggested drinks to fit our tastes.  First set of drinks: Gin's Tonic and Gimlet. Both very good. The tonic was a peach version so it tastes a little different, but good.  First course: special of the night: Lamb salami. WOW. Good portion and perfect starter. Comes on a plate with stone ground mustard, dijon mustard, pickled items, and some seed bread. The meat itself is very lightly salted and a light meat flavor (different from genoa salami, in a fresh way). The accompaniments really add a different flavor to the meat, allowing each bite to be a little different. But my favorite was the meat by itself.  Second course: Fried shiitake and oyster mushrooms. WOW. You had me at shiitake! but the addition of light breading, balsamic drizzle and lentils just takes the shiitake taste to that yummy earthy mushroom flavor. so good!  Second set of drinks: Brandy Old Fashioned and Bee's Knees. Bee's Knees, how do I love you? Very much! Found a new favorite drink in the Mad-town! I love honey, I love lemon, I love Gin! Now I love Bee's Knees! (It wasn't \"on\" the menu but the bartender suggested I'd like it after my tendency toward citrus drinks.) The secret ingredient was some fennel/sugary topping.  Brandy Old Fashioned - too heavy on the alcohol burn for my liking, but it tasted decent. The brandy soaked cherry was very tasty.  Third course: house made Buckwheat Cavatelli. WOW. me LEEKy! The cavatelli is a hearty, warm, soul filling dish. But the leeks really made it standout. The pasta is cooked then butter pan fried, tossed with the leeks and some daikon chunks. The daikon is a radish with a very slight sour flavor, which added something unique.   Fourth course: Sea bass. Good. I am not a huge fan of sea bass, due to my previous experience of it tasting \"fishy.\" I was raised in the Heartland on cows so Sea bass is what I consider a medium to heavy fish-flavored fish. But we ordered it b/c the other big entrees were just too meaty or too milky. The sea bass was cooked perfect, with skin on one side. The flavor only hinted of fish, but could be hidden in the olive smear on the bottom of the plate. For those of you who like heavy omega oil fish, this might barely scratch that surface. For people like me that likes a light to medium fish flavor, Forequarter does a great job on keeping the fish flavor low. The best part about this dish was the pork chunks - yum! There was also  a potato cake in the dish. It was flakey and thick, but just felt heavy. It didn't seem to do much for the flavors in the dish.  Dessert: Cookie Plate. WOW! I love Macaroons! woo hoo! Did you know macaroons are just little cookie cakes? um YUM! I'm not sure if they make these in-house (I can't believe not), but the macaroons are just heavenly. The other 2 cookies on the plate are delicious too. All of them go great with the Baltimore Madeira.  After dinner, we were talking to another bar mate and the bartender informed me\"I did not give you the Madeira you ordered, I am going to give you that one for free.\" Say What?! Free? Really I wouldn't have known any better and I told her \"I didn't need a full pour, but would love to test the one I had ordered.\" The one I had ordered was a Whiskey aged in Madeira barrels; the one I received was a simple Madeira. Whiskey is VERY different from Madeira! I am a Madeira convert! Yummy sweet wine thing! (The whiskey was a strong whiskey burn and smokiness with an underlying sweetness.)  Overall, this place is awesome. 4 out of 5 food items WOWed us. The drinks were great. Depending on your proximity and propensity toward eating and/or drinking, you can easily spend $30 - $60/person."}
{"text":"I came with friends for drinks / snacks during bar time (10pm - 1am) -- so this is a review of Forequarter the bar, not Forequarter the restaurant.  All in all a great night.  Cocktails were amazing.  Sidecar, \"Cola,\" daily Old Fashioned, \"Fruit Punch,\" were incredibly tasty.  Other cocktails we had were good overall. Great to see creative craft cocktails making a splash (ha) in a beer town.      Great ambience (classic ceilings, place is decently tucked away from downtown bustle) although for a cold December night the cold air draft blowing in every time someone opened the door got pretty bad.  There were only 2 food items available on the late menu (meat & cheese plate + sausage plate) which is a bit unfortunate -- it'd be nice to at least have a few more food items to munch on.  Service was fantastic and there was actually decent amounts of seating still available on a Saturday night.  We told the waitress we were hungry for more food and the kitchen gave us seasoned fried guineafowl skin to munch on for free.  The meat & cheese plate was decent and the brussels sprouts w guineafowl sausage was super tasty.  Brussels sprouts were nicely charred and seasoned and they gave us more sprouts and bread when we asked.  Drinks are pretty pricey for what you get in this neck of the woods -- $8-14 per cocktail and many of the cocktails were smaller than a standard lowball glass.  Slightly lower prices, more food options, and double doors would've easily justified 5 stars.  The place lived up to the hype."}
{"text":"I always come to Forequarter excited and sometimes leave extremely satisfied while other times underwhelmed.   Forequarter offers patrons American style food complimented by European influences made with  many locally sourced options. The atmosphere is small and cozy. Sometimes it can be a bit too cozy and, unfortunately, overbearingly loud if one large party shows up.   On every visit, we order the fried mushrooms with the black garlic truffle. Usually, this is one of the highlights of the visit. The mushrooms come out fried with unmatched texture and contains a blend of tasty shiitakes, oysters, and others. Last time we went, we ordered this and it turns out Forequarter didnt receive the mushrooms that are usually put in the dish. Additionally, our mushrooms were undercooked. We tried to politely inform our waiter that the mushrooms were not right, but he just didn't get the hint.  Other than a few base options, the menu does rotate, and the online menu should be take only as an example of the type of flavors you will get here. An example of one of my favorites dishes was a rainbow trout that was stuffed with leeks. The flavor was unmatched and really everything tasted fresh - one of the times that I would identify this place as a hit. Other times, however, I've ordered main dishes that have come out cold or underseasoned - bah humbug.  Forequarter is a great restaurant with a great concept. After a number of visits, however, and an accumulation of paper cut magnitude negative experiences, I would say my experience here overall is slightly above average in comparison to similar options in Madison."}
{"text":"We ate at Forequarter two days ago, having more drinks than food, as it turned out. So:   Drinks:  I had two: the first was a simple Sazerac, the other a more complicated Bourbon-Cherry-Coffee drink whose name I forget.   Sazerac: Is it supposed to be that loaded with bitters? This is more or less my drink of choice, and I've never had it that spicy before. Strong, pretty small.   BCC drink: Holy shit balls (as Danny DeVito would say), this was good.   The girl's drink: gin, gingerale, some herbs. I think called a \"Les Cousins Dangereux\", (which gets points for the name, btw). This way also very good. Very fresh.   So drinks: 4.5/5  Food: We had a cheese thing (not worth it) and the Broccoli Rabe, which was good, but overly bready. Maybe we should have had more food, but really we were enjoying our drinks too much.   So, worth going. Maybe next time I'll try more of the food."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite Madison restaurant.  Excellent, creative food.  My most recent meal included a braunsweiger appetizer, nettle buckwheat cavatelli and dunbarton blue cheese - perfect.  I've been many times and always have a memorable meal.  Love the E Johnson location."}
{"text":"Good restaurant for a date night but unfortunately they do not take reservations. The food is good but I feel that the place is a bit overrated for the price."}
{"text":"This is a great date night place in Wisconsin.  The dim surroundings contributed greatly to the intimate atmosphere.  While the cocktails were overly sweet, the chèvre and beet tart as well as the chicken liver mousse were both delicious.  On the pricier side, but worth it."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Milwaukee and found this rockin' place. The food was delicious and the ambiance was creative but subtle. Service was friendly and efficient but not in your face. Everything was very affordable while being thoughtfully prepared from the craft cocktails to the plates. Such a lovely place!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Just had a birthday dinner here, and this place has definitely kept its edge. They still fill up, even on a Wednesday night with temperatures below zero.   In my initial review, I gave a lot of detail on the food I had. They give their food and drink so, so much thought, that this only seemed fair. Their menu changes frequently, so I thought this time I might be a little more general.   Their cheese and meat plates/boards are extremely well put together, and surprisingly generous. In my most recent visit, I had an big wedge of amazing aged Spanish blue cheese served with a large handful of candied almonds, Meyer lemon jam, and several slices of toasted bread. I felt $10 was pretty reasonable, especially considering how perfect it was.   They make their own pasta, and it's fabulous. The portions are a little small, but it's just so freaking good it's hard to complain.   Order adventurously. I had beef tongue with yuzu and mochi AND IT WAS BOMB.   The service is wonderful. At such a high-end place, you might think the service would be snobby or intimidating, but I've only had good experiences here. The wait staff is really helpful, so don't be afraid to ask what something is, or what it tastes like! Their recommendations are often quite good as well."}
{"text":"A total disappointment.  Food: Our orders that were protein-based were exceptionally well prepared with obviously very fine ingredients. Vegetables were mostly undercooked and starchy. All were served on absurdly large plates, obviously trying way too hard to be chic fine dining.  Service was awful. \"We'll see if we can find a place for you\" sort of mentality. We were not given cocktail menus at the start, our waitress totally lacked confidence and finesse.  You can bring fine dining to Madison without pretension and faux-exclusivity.  I live in Brooklyn and can smell bullshit a mile away. This place is bullshit."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great service. Great Cocktails. Delicious food...Aggressively, absurdly small portions.    Here's my theory, places like Forequarter and Heritage Tavern are trying to keep their dollar sign rating on sites like yelp to \"$$$\" rather than having a \"$$$$\" rating to draw a broader crowd. They don't want any one item on the menu to break a certain price point.   But Forequarter is actually a \"$$$$\" place in the Madison scene. To leave here full, you'll need to share a cheese or meat plate ($10-$13), get an appetizer ($8-$16) which they say you can share, but you cannot. Then you'll need an entree ($18-$23), and then finish with a dessert ($10). Don't forget a cocktail ($10) or a glass of wine ($9). This ends up being far more expensive than a place charging $35 for an entree.    So, when all is said and done, it ends up feeling unwelcoming. It's hard to figure how out to eat correctly on the menu if it's your first time, because you'll have a hard time guessing just how much you need to order. And, whenever something is brought to the table, you won't think, \"Oh, wow,\" I think, \"Seriously?\""}
{"text":"I love the gastropub trend in Madison. And I can't believe how I could have not written a review on it. This little unassuming shophouse along Johnson street hosts one of the best sharing plates in Madison. Drinks, top notch. Food, delicious and creative. I have never had a disappointing time here, ever.  The only thing I will watch out for is the crowd. Hipsters LOVE forequarter. Foodies love forequarter. EVERYONE does. And its tiny place can only fit maybe 25-30 people at a time. So, no reservations other than Sundays mean you have to come early, leave your name, and in the winter find some other place to hang out cos its too small to wait in the restaurant... Or, come really late. after 9pm.  Food. what's good? EVERYTHING. also, they change their menu all the time that my favorites just leave the menu as quickly as they come. However, if you see items that resemble these things, DON'T HESITATE.  Love the grilled bread. It had so many ingredients hidden inside, the wonderful crust outside. I'm so sad it never reappeared in the past 6 months.  Gnocchi. oh those soft pillow. with the wonderful caramelized crust. chewy and lovely. my favorite friend in the world.  Fried chicken. oooh, i love my chicken cooked medium rare. some people don't like the red, but COME ON, chicken shouldn't be overcooked. ew.  pork shoulder. mmmmm... so good. the amount of fat and meat was just nice. so flavorful. oh god. how could they have got this so right.  drinks with egg white. YAY. so tasty. you could even ask for the egg yolk if you are into this kinda thing ;)  Liquid nitrogen ice cream! I love it!!! the texture is so awesome. it was peppermint and chocolate. love it!! It's just like the Taiwanese snow ice.  This is an awesome place for couples to visit. dim lights, good food and drinks. Best date EVER!"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere at Forequarter and I've enjoyed going there for drinks in the past, but the food was a little disappointing. I had the fried mushrooms for an appetizer and squash cavatelli for a main course.  Both tasted like they were made with really good ingredients but the mixture of tastes wasn't amazing.  My friend had the puffed beef tendon, which was so rich that it was actually kind of difficult to eat (at least for me).  We had to order bread to even out the meal.  I'd go there again for drinks but I don't think the food was worth it, especially given the price."}
{"text":"This place is great! It's rare to find a place that makes fantastic cocktails, has great food, and a great beer list. We came here from Chicago and there's a place in Evanston called Ward Eight that is very similar. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went there last night and were very impressed with the food!! We had a charcuterie plate and a cheese plate, along with a nice bottle of Prosecco.  The presentation and taste of each was divine to the look and the palate. Service was not so great.  Waiter had to come back and ask me which bottle I had ordered, food was delivered without a smile, water glasses not refilled, Prosecco was kept on ice behind the bar, he never kept up on refilling those either and after our meal, we still had a 1/4 bottle to kill.  Not meant to be a shot - meant to be sipped.  We were also at a table in the back by the end of the bar and the restrooms.  We had to overhear the bar/wait staff in the area talking about the personal lives together.  Sorry but for the prices they charge, no matter how good the food, staff needs a little polishing up."}
{"text":"Really poor customer service. Came in 8:30 on a Friday night with my wife to eat (since no reservations allowed). Not a soul waiting or milling about. Told that there was a 35 minute wait. When I enquired how this could be, was told by the maitre'd that \"she didn't know\" but that  lot of people wait elsewhere. I can understand this to a point, but that \"you don't know\"? I would expect that you better know, as they would have left a contact number! Seriously turned off by the self-important, dismissive, hipster vibe. How about a real greeting? Too much to ask."}
{"text":"Last night, Friday I went to Forequarter for the first time. We arrived at 5pm. The restaurant is lovely... rustic and cozy. Unfortunately it is winter in Wisconsin so we never really felt warm. Few Spirits was offering a tasting of their gin, rye and bourbon. I tried the rye which was smooth and full flavored. Some cocktails were offered at a reduced price putting to use the Few products. I ordered a Negroni and my friend got a Gin Mule. Both were expertly prepared and presented.  The waitress was excellent. Very knowledgeable, not overly intrusive and available when needed. We started with the Duck and Turkey Rillette with Crostini and Micro Green Salad ($10). It was absolutely decadent and yummy. One could be put off by the layer of fat atop the rillette but had it been pate there would have been the same fat content but it would have been pureed into the meat. My friend is something of a vegetarian but she loved this opening course.  Next we shared The Roasted Mushroom and Citrus Panzella $13) and the Herb Cavatelli with house made ricotta, caramelized onions, parsnips and spicy greens (14).  The servings were medium sized. We were not full but we were more than satisfied. Someone with a larger appetite (and wallet) may want a dish to themselves. Both dishes were perfect. The homemade pasta was toothsome, the ricotta creamy and tangy and the parsnips added a special sweetness in the background. The panzella (bread salad) was equally delicious with the earthy mushrooms being the star.  I certainly plan to return and see what other wonderful creations they will present. I would be happy to sit at the bar, order some of the small plates, enjoy a few cocktails and have someone drive me home. That, would be my perfect evening."}
{"text":"One of the top restaurants in its class in Madison. I have eaten here countless times, and it never fails to please. Craft cocktails and the well-considered, focused menu features many organic and local ingredients. A different  selection Underground Meats and local cheeses are always featured, and a nice thing to share.   Prices are appropriate for this style of restaurant, although likely a little high for some. The staff is always knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive. The restaurant is small so make a reservation or arrive early. It is worth the wait if you have to."}
{"text":"Creative, tasty drinks, and shockingly good food from a tiny kitchen. Best dining experience in Madison so far, and I've tried most of the foodie restaurants. Small, busy, and foes not take reservations, so be prepared to wait. It's worth it."}
{"text":"We had a large group here over Great Taste weekend last summer, and it went off without a hitch. That says a lot for how professional the staff is here. Didn't get a hint of pretension or snobbiness, and our group was pretty mixed (foodies/non-foodies).   Constant courses flying by, the charcuterie was a real standout, especially the N'duja (local producer Underground Meats, which I later found at Fromagination). Also a rabbit terrine that was very memorable. Many rich, savory, rustic dishes, especially the vegetables.  Tiny space, very intimate. We showed up a half hour before they opened and had no problems seating a dozen people. One of the most memorable dinners i've had in Madison in the last 10 years visiting there."}
{"text":"If I had one place to take my well-traveled best friend anywhere in Madison, this would be it. True story.   They lured me in with their late night drinks and gained my trust to come back for dinner. For two of us, three platters was the right amount to have a fair sampling of the menu and amusingly struggle with towards the end. Still, we had room for dessert.    The cookie platter would have sounded boring at any other place but at this point I'd let them serve me a paper bag. It was like $3 per cookie, but seriously, it was the best cookie experience I've ever had. The cookies were pairings OF EACH OTHER, and I was still fantasizing about their textures several days later. What sort of witchcraft or wizardry must one do to pair cookies like that?   Our server had great suggestions when we asked, and helped us narrow down our choices. Their menu seems to change often, so don't expect to order something you've read about on here. It's like bungee jumping with a really great bungee cable -- just trust, and let go. It's not great for large groups because of the small space and its popularity. Plus, the bathroom is kind of cold in the winter. Can you tell I'm struggling to write a balanced review?   Forequarter makes me feel grateful to be without specific dietary needs because limiting the menu in any way would make me sad, knowing what I know now. While there's been much online and word-of-mouth hype about this place, it's still an understated experience."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night. We were told it would be over an hour wait, but we can sit at the bar if we wanted. We got drinks up at the bar while waiting for the rest of our group. The cocktails are very well done, and a decent wine/beer selection.  We eventually ordered the large charcuterie board, the fried chicken hearts, the fried beef tendon & bone marrow, the roasted mushrooms, the picked trout, the smoked beets, and the pork chop. The charcuterie board changes regularly and you get to pick 3 meats. The options were all very tasty. The chicken hearts were very well prepared, no irony taste there. The roasted mushrooms were amazing, with roasted garlic flavors. The beets were quite refreshing after all the fried stuff. The pickled trout was ok, it came with cheese, and the cheese to fish ratio was a bit unbalanced. Too much cheese, not enough trout. The tendon/marrow combo, I really wanted to love it. It was just ok. It could have had a bit more seasoning.  Lastly there's the pork chop. Omg, this thing is massive! Do not, I repeat, do not order it on your own unless you are training for an eating competition. It came with roasted parsnips and red onion. It was fantastically done. Very juicy and flavored well with herbed butter on top. The chop itself had nice fat marbled throughout. But again, this is an entree that should be shared.  Forequarter definitely did not disappoint. I have been wanting to come here for a long time and have finally made it here. They have interesting preparations of their ingredients and can't wait to be back again."}
{"text":"Forequarter still remains my favorite restaurant in Madison.  Not only they have the most interesting and delicately made cocktails, their wide selection of smaller bites and appetizers are always mind blowing.  They really know for how to play with flavors and stimulate your palate. With their every so often updated menu, you will always bring home some new adventures.  Good portion size, reasonably priced and wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"Drinks are awesome. Love the fact they make everything and use local stuff. Very interesting menu and yes it seems anything you order is really good! Had the garatine I think it's called. Soooo good. Had the sausage platter. Only two kinds of sausages, little dissapointed wanted more variety but still it was good. The sides around it were good. I would t say it's worth 22 dollars though. I'm not a mustard fan and they seem to use it a lot. It was alright. Will probably come back again that says a lot. I don't usually go back twice to any place when I travel. Pig in a fur coat is another one I will go back to as well."}
{"text":"We went with so much expectations and they met every bit of my expectation on our first 3 courses. The fried new potatoes, smoked pepper aioli, pickled mustard seed was to die for. I would just go in for this dish.   Our medium plate of chicken was too dry and the large plate of shiitake, ricotta herb dumplings, fennel, mustard greens, mushroom broth, sunflower seed pistou  wasn't as delicate as I expected it to be. I just expected too much. I am giving 4 stars for the service they provide and the exceptional quality of food they served- specially our first 3 courses.  The charcuterie board, pickles, mustard, olives & bread was a well thought out meal on a board. The variety of bread, crackers they served were unique.   I will visit again as they seem to change their menu quite a bit. Must visit for a unique experience."}
{"text":"Hailing from Milwaukee (though a Madison girl at heart) I find myself in the position to judge the hipster crowd.  I honestly was turned off my the \"hipster\" description in previous reviews because often hipster restaurants in Milwaukee mean \"Please be ready to order and don't ask questions or I'll walk away\".  Hipster at Forequarter means nothing of the sort!  Great atmosphere, very minimal and cozy.  Lots of wood and plants.  I like! That being said their AC isn't super strong so if you are sensitive to temps come on a cooler night.  The service was phenomenal.  They were very welcoming and offered great suggestions.  The bar tenders also whipped up a great NA cocktail for the mama-to-be which was awesome.  I liked that the cooks, servers and bartenders fluttered about quickly but never with a feeling of panic or in a way that made us feel guilty for them being so busy.  It was a well oiled machine and people seemed happy to be there.  Cocktails: Excellent and inventive cocktail list.  Try the whiskey soda pop, it will not disappoint.  Great list of liquors, decent wine and beer list too.  Food:  Excellent food served on wooden cutting boards.  My personal favorite was the market vegetable dish, crazy to say this over some roasted veggies but it truly was one of the best things I have ever eaten.  The flavor combos were AMAZING and fresh.  The fried mushroom plate was good but too much for the hubs and I, we wouldn't order it again.  They also have a cheese of the day which was amazing, served with preserves and fresh bread from Madison Sourdough.  Finally we had the quail because I always follow Yelper reviews.  My husband is still talking about this meal. The veggies were cooked perfectly, the pudding was amazing and the ground cherries added even more depth.  It was quite good.  This place is worth every penny and I can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"I can now report that bread is available at Forequarter for $4  a basket.  Thank you, Forequarter for making this change."}
{"text":"Trendy some may call it pretentious bar/restaurant. More like a tapas place than a full fledged eatery.  On the noisy side , no ac. Drinks are interesting and quite good but like the rest of the servings here on the stingy side. My cheese plate appetizer was good. My shataki mushroom dish was a disappointment, with way too hot sauce painted in dabs all around the dish so it was hard to avoid. Food was served on a butcher block cutting board, one wonders how they keep it clean!?"}
{"text":"Delicious drinks and foodstuffs. Staff is not overly friendly."}
{"text":"Sad to report that we had a pretty disappointing experience here. We were visiting from Chicago and this place came highly recommended so we were really looking forward to it. We ended up waiting about an hour and a half for a wait that was quoted at 45 minutes. Not a huge deal, it was Saturday and the place is tiny.   The cocktails were subpar at best. The charcuterie was probably the highlight of the meal, but even so, I've definitely had much better. The entrees are outrageously overpriced, the two hot entrees we ordered were cold when they got to the table and they were miserably bland. The staff reacted as if it were insane that anyone could complain, and though they were not very apologetic they did take a large portion of the bill off.   Unless this was just an off night for the place, my guess is that if you have any experience dining at restaurants like this one, you will be sorely disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times I've been underwhelmed. It's overpriced, definitely. If the food were amazing, then this wouldn't be an issue.   I ordered the whitefish salad and it was full of little fish bones. While all these bones added a light crunch, I'm not so sure they were supposed to be there. When you pay $11 for a small plate of food, it should be flawless.  I mentioned the boney food and the manager gave me my two beers for free. And while this was actually a nice thing to do, I feel that the meal should have been free since my stomach is now swimming with lovely little fish bones.  Keep in mind, I did love Underground Kitchen when it was open, and I love the stuff the Collective does. I'm just not a fan of overpriced, flawed food."}
{"text":"I'd recommend getting your reservations early as the place is quite small. I had ricotta herb dumplings in a shiitake mushroom broth. It was amazing. I'd recommend this place for a date night. And if you want another drink after the Robin room down the street is great."}
{"text":"The overall impression is that the food is pretty good, but also heavy and not that original. Most courses share a similar flavor profile and, for what I ate, I found the place quite pricey. I got a cocktail to start, don't recall the name, but it wasn't very good.  The appetizers/sides were nice but expensive. We got the Brussel sprouts and the fish puffs. I was very excited for the smoked pork as my main course: it was generally tasty, but also too sweet and a bit dry. The portion of the main course was also unnecessarily large, which bumped the price to ~35$ for no particular reason. The side was a fairly boring mashed sweet potato. I enjoyed the first impressions of my meal, but things went downhill due to the overall lack of flavor profiles. I would probably not come back."}
{"text":"The hype around the opening of Four Quarter was palpable.  It was disappointing.  The menu is exceptionally limited; there are approximately eight tables and the space is cramped.  The portions are small plate, tapas-like, to be shared, but this is not clear going in.  Parking is difficult. If you have a reservation, which is needed, arrive early to find a parking space.  The bar is wonderful and the drinks are delicious.  Pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Very good food carefully prepared, I've been here a few times and personally think this is one if the five best restaurants in Madison. This round our group of four tried around ten of the selections each was delicious! My advice - go early, go often!"}
{"text":"Had the hangar steak and it was phenomenal! Had amazing chimmichurri sauce on it and came with delicious mash potatoes! The drink menu is unique and tasty! The place felt very intimate and had a cool vibe. My only complaint would be that the chairs we were sitting on were wobbly and uncomfortable"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, loved the decor. Wonderful cocktail section.  Everything we ate was delicious and the staff were knowledgeable and friendly. A perfect dinner in Madison and I will be back!"}
{"text":"My sister and I went here and had a great time.  We were seated promptly and received our food promptly as well.  The staff was nice and the food was great.  I had roasted sablefish and it was delicious."}
{"text":"a disappointing evening, sad to say.  went with a friend who had special dietary needs and when she asked for mixed greens or some plain cooked  vegetables they said no.  There were three of us and two of us were ordering a full dinner with drinks and wine.  I don't think I will bother to go back. the food wasn't memorable and my friend who ordered the snapper on lentils was unimpressed.  sad because our first experience with this restaurant had been very positive which is why we chose it to celebrate my birthday.  not much of a celebration when they have such an unaccomodating attitude."}
{"text":"My friend and I arrived around 7 pm on a Sunday night - packed, as usual, but this crowdedness is chiefly a function of the tiny, tiny size of the space. No table, of course, so we sat at the bar near the door with the cold, cold air blowing in from time to time. The bartender/waitress was helpful but kept answering questions as if I already knew the place. (My friend tells me this is part of the restaurant's aim: to have a local feel and following hence the tiny space and the assumption I already know they run a butcher shop.) The menu doesn't make obvious sense with escalating prices but no category identification. It took the server a while to explain it, but she eventually indicated we should share a couple of smaller plates and each order a larger plate (not so designated but implied by price). Anyway, the first course was a tiny, tiny beet salad with something that looked like dirt and tasted like oreos and some ice cream (!). My friend really enjoyed it, but I found the skimpy serving to be ridiculous: they're beets. How much are beets? Anyway, I'm done complaining -- from this point on the meal was very nice: cavatelli with lamb was yummy and ample; I had the sausage plate with Portlandia-worthy pedigree on the veal/pork/beef - tasty. The wines were hit or miss. I would go back to this place but not rush back."}
{"text":"While the food was great, I did not feel appreciated as a guest at Forequarter. As other Yelpers have noted, \"pretentious\" is the key word here.  My New Year's Eve reservation was at 5:00 p.m. After walking down two snowpacked blocks from my parking spot -- P.S.: I have no idea where guests are supposed to park -- I had to stand outside of Forequarter in 20-degree weather with strong wind until 5:00 p.m. on the dot because their doors were locked. The Forequarter staff inside surely saw the six of us standing there in the cold; we saw them!  My complaint is not unreasonable; I understand a business having specific hours, and I understand a business taking reservations due to limited space and seating. If Forequarter is so adamant about keeping its doors locked until 5:00 p.m., though, it should not book reservations exactly at 5:00 p.m. as a courtesy to guests so they don't have to stand outside in the cold like nincompoops.  During dinner, three men, presumably the owners, walked into Forequarter. One helped himself to a glass of beer behind the bar. Did not chit-chat with or greet guests. Since they were in/out of the kitchen and speaking with the staff, they clearly had some higher-up position with the restaurant, yet they gave off a very unprofessional vibe.  Food was quite good. Best dish of the night was the fried brussels sprouts. All the other dishes we tried were cooked well and were quite tasty.   In the end, Forequarter is a good place to go if you like small plates. It's not a good place to go if you like good service. I prefer Graft on the Square for small plate/tapas-style style food, though. And Graft also doesn't make me stand out in the cold."}
{"text":"We went out for a Monday night impromptu celebration for a dissertation milestone and had a fabulous meal at the bar. I had the cider drink and my boyfriend had some sort of persimmon sour cocktail. Both were fabulous. The wait-staff were at first a tad standoffish and I made a change request for the main meal (I asked to not have the fries that came with the main as they were cooked in duck fat). Our bartendress talked with the chef and I was given a salad instead. After that everything went peachy and she was a doll. We started with a salmon rillettes (with plenty of bread) and then moved on to the special for the evening - the trout.  The food was unbelievably good. And we enjoy cooking so rarely venture out, as our own meals tend to be hard to beat. My boyfriend also had wine with his main course and she offered suggestions and a taste of one of the selections - as his first choice was not available. The service was top-notch and friendly; by the evening's end and we had a great celebration with fabulous food, unusual and complex drinks and really appropriate and good service. 3 drinks, hors d'oeuvre and 2 mains  - with tip ~$80 (It was a celebration...)  A place well worth returning to. It would hold its own in Chicago, NY or LA."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Very eclectic menu. Our party had quail, salmon, sausage, asparagus and scrambled duck eggs.  All were excellent, but sausage got highest marks. Excellent cocktails - especially the daiquiri."}
{"text":"Fun and unique food, but ultimately nothing special.  Service was average, and some of the plates were meh, overrated.  I was with a large group and we tried the majority of the menu.  Nothing was overly memorable. Still a quality place and I would go back."}
{"text":"I love Madison! This was my third visit to Madison and the city continues to thrill me. And one of the reasons that the city charmed me this time was this tiny gem of a place. My friend Kat who's a Madison resident recommended this joint and ready to experiment we readily agreed. And forequarter lived up to the hype that Kat had generated. The small cheese board, the Brussels sprouts, the poached trout, the honey cake, and the absolutely smoked fish beignets all hit their mark as an ace marksman's target practice. The service was attentive, but not intrusive. The ambience allowed for conversation but was also lively. Oh, and also an impressive beer list. Another one added to the must visit destinations in the already eclectic Madison food scene! Truly impressed."}
{"text":"Small intimate space with great ambiance.  Innovative menu features delicious small and medium plates made for sharing.  Attentive service."}
{"text":"Forequarter has the kind of candle-lit, dark wood ambiance that makes me a fan immediately upon walking in. Then, you pick up the cocktail menu and realized they have bottled cocktails as well as an extensive list of creative concoctions and fall a bit more in love with the place. Heck, even their non-alcoholic drink list is impressive. After you've ordered a drink you begin to peruse the menu, which happens to change a little bit everyday, and you know without a doubt Forequarter is the kind of place you want to frequent regularly. I ate dinner here with a group of people and because of that was allowed the opportunity to sample lots of dishes. Honestly, there was a bad bite I put into my mouth.   It's a lovely spot for dinner with friends or a date and if I lived in Madison it would definitely be in my date night rotation. As it stands, I'm so glad I had the opportunity to try Forequarter on my travels to Madison!"}
{"text":"The reservation policy here is so frustrating and seems to change day by day. Can't rate them because never can get in. Either take reservations or don't. If I didn't have a gift card here that is substantial I wouldn't waste my time. Parking is Terrible and the policy of we will call u when we have a table is not a good strategy because not a lot of places to walk to especially in the winter. High hassle factor!"}
{"text":"Food was outrageous. Ed, our bar tender, was the most personable and knowledgeable bar tender I've ever had. Drinks were fabulous. Order off the menu or just chat with Ed and he'll make you something special. You must check out this scene!"}
{"text":"I just had an amazing brunch.  I had the smoked whitefish and cured trout plate.  So good!  The bartender Christian was really knowledgeable and provided excellent service.  I'll be back to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"We ate here for New Years Eve. We were sat at the bar, which I usually hate, but I didn't mind it here. The place is very cute and cozy. Since the menu is continually rotating, I won't go into detail regarding what we ordered. The appetizer and root vegetable side dish were decent, but we both felt they were under seasoned and the veggies were undercooked. We split a giant pork t-bone for our entree. It was good, but unevenly cooked.  That can be the case with a giant slab of meat on a bone, but it was still disappointing. My husband loved his beer, and I loved my glass of wine (don't remember the name, but the bartender is very helpful in getting you something you like).  I don't know if we will be back since it was somewhat pricey for just an okay meal."}
{"text":"I really want to give Forequarter five stars because the food and drinks were outstanding.  But the experience itself however, not so much.  Our server showed no flexibility whatsoever.  She seemed more interested in telling us about what they will or won't do, than in what we wanted or needed.  She seemed like a product of the collective gone hipster robo-tron.  Since our experience may have just been a result of one server gone wrong, we will be back.  We hope that the Collective itself affords its servers the flexibility to look after their diners' desires with some care and sympathy.  Instructive Example:  While dining a nearby restaurant in Madison, we asked for a side of the sweetbreads that are only on the menu as part of a steak entreé.  Our server happily took the question to the chef, who quickly obliged our simple request.  That made us happy.  We got the opposite in a lack of accommodation from our server at Forequarter.  Some things are so easy to fix."}
{"text":"An awesome place. I visited with my roommate on a weekday evening and we really enjoyed it. The ambiance is so \"cool\" - we walked into, looked around, and looked at each other and said, \"this place is really hip.\" The decor, the dim lighting - really a good vibe. It's a pretty tiny place but we were seated immediately (the perks of seeking fine dining on a Tuesday - though it was actually pretty full).   We shared several entrees among the three of us, which I think they recommend doing. We had the summer squash, quail, and sausage platter, all of which were great. You can tell that they use high-quality ingredients and put a lot of care into each dish. I especially liked the sausage board, because hey, we're in Wisconsin.  Drinks were great, too. I had the \"Dark and Stormy\" which had a good balance between rum and ginger beer. We sat at a table, but I would like to come back and sit at the bar sometime.   Service was attentive and our waitress was very friendly.   Overall, a great dining experience that lived up to the hype."}
{"text":"What happened to the portions?  I returned to Forequarter after having such a pleasant experience 2 years ago.   Big shout out to the bar staff who were really great, showcasing such interesting cocktails.  The food, though was a huge disappointment.   What happened to the portion sizes?   These were definitely kid-sized at adult-prices.   The app, main and dessert were way too tiny for the prices.   Sure, everything was great, but I left very hungry.  I spoke to a friend who shared the same experience -- what happened here?"}
{"text":"LOUSY.  Normally I would have given it two stars but since i found the chef a bit too callous and the restaurant rather unprofessional, here is my score and reasoning.  First, Everyone wants to have a good time regardless of how much they spend. When you spend $140 in less than an hour on a simple meal, you deserve to expect certain level of food.  Value 2/5.  Service: I liked our server Katie who was sweet and personable. I felt bad for her but had to let her know in no uncertain terms that our lamb was not up to par. 4/5  As is my practice going to a restaurant for the first time, i ask for the best items. Katie made suggestions to us. We essentially got all she said was good.   Mushroom with black garlic: way too salty. So much so, i could not taste the black garlic. 2/5  Braised endives.  2/5  Bread. I asked for it. Came pre-sliced and a bit stale.  For a restaurant like that they need to slice the bread before brining to the table.    Pickled trout.  1/5  Lamb.  Katie told us their lamb comes mainly red and is flavorful.  Lamb arrived. It was  well done, it felt to be a slice of the very corner of the lamb they had cooked...and damn -- the darn thing was full of fat.  Both my wife and i thought maybe this is the way they cook it until we saw one served to the table next to us which seemed a more substantial piece with redness.    I told Katie that our lamb looked and was nothing as good. She essentially seemed to avoid it.  After a while i decided it bugged me enough that I asked her to please tell the chef I was not happy with it.  She came back with an explanation that baffled me.  If i understood her correctly, the chef had said he wanted a slice from a particular part of the lamb and it came different. I said but he has eyes and he can see a bad piece and this was kinda piece good restaurants use to cut and throw out rather than serve.   Again after a while and feeling really screwed, i asked Katie if the chef was also the owner. No. I asked who the manager was. There is no manager. An owner only. Is the owner in? No.  WTF.  Sorry I hate to be hard on people but I have a lot of respect for people who admit their mistakes...in this case not taking ownership was not graceful and in fact disrespectful. If the chef had an ounce of respect for his work or the diners, he would not have served this cut of meat.  Lamb 1/5  at $26,  This is bull shit.  Quail. 3/5.  Some cookies arrived, courtesy of the kitchen. I could careless (with appreciation of course).  2/5 mainly because the truffles were good.  Again, thanks to Katie that despite a difficult situation, provided the best service she could."}
{"text":"Fabulous little place on the near-east side of Madison; glad to see the Underground folks back up and running!  Small menu but plenty of things worth trying. Incredibly detailed cocktail menu as well for those who enjoy high-class alcoholic concoctions. Small but classy selection of beers and wines.  Some of the portion sizes don't make sense (e.g., the amazing \"ripped\" bread seems designed for four and thus was a bit overwhelming for me and my wife, and the cheese platter has one type of cheese in a rather large amount instead of a few smaller offerings), so that is something to plan around when ordering. Or perhaps the proprietors will figure out that offering a 1/2 ripped bread is a good idea, once they read this sparkling review. You do read these reviews, right?  The spanish chicken is simply amazing.  Looking forward to going back. Do be warned that the place can get a little loud, if you care about that sort of thing (i.e., you're old, like me). For example, the people sitting next to us thought everything they said was quite funny, leading to staccato bursts of laughter in my right ear, while I can assure you that really only a small fraction of their bon mots really hit the mark; it might be that the cocktail menu (detailed above) had something to do with this."}
{"text":"Love what they do here.  Light to heavy options.  Excellent drinks.  Knowledgable waitstaff.  Highly suggest for small group outings for a little celebration."}
{"text":"I would have given this rating 5 stars because our food was out-of-this-world-good.  But I gave it 4 stars because I was absolutely freezing my bum off then entire dinner!  Mind you...it was -15 outside.  So any drafty place will have cold issues.    I would recommend the Martini for a drink, the meat/cheese board for appetizer, the beet salad, and the roasted quail.  Delicious."}
{"text":"Stunned nearly speechless. Wow, just wow, was all I could say as we were walking out. Stunned for several reasons: how on earth had it taken me so long to eat here? how on earth could a five dollar happy hour burger be that good? how do they make those mushrooms so darn amazing (thanks for the tip fellow Yelpers!)? how could a place do easily excel at dessert too? WHOA.   I've been a long time fan of Underground Butcher so it's not surprise their sister restaurant is fantastic. In full disclosure, I've only been once and came *just* for the HH burgers. Simple yet amazing. The house made pickles were divine. I don't even like mayo-even fact really really don't like it but this mayo was light and flavorful, mixing perfectly with all the other components instead of overpowering everything else. The brioche bun was perfection. I'm also not a fan of American cheese but this house made American cheese was no ordinary American cheese. I'd argue it's in a category all it's own. mmmmm and drrrooooolll. Oh that burger. I'm excited to come back but hard to say if I'll be able to order something other that that burger. Better come after HH.  If you like mushrooms at all, you must try the mushrooms. There are as excellent as promised. That black garlic was just fabulous. Like lick the bowl fabulous. Alas, it's still not socially appropriate so I just scraped and scraped until it was nearly gone. For dessert we had the fancy brownie sundae. The brownies were basically like triangles of fudgey goodness with underlying salty notes. YUM. Topped with awesome hot fudge, meringues and brandy ice cream."}
{"text":"probably the best meal i've had in madison yet.  i lived down the street from forequarter for two years and finally got around to stopping by (see: finally graduated from grad school and had more than two pennies to rub together), and now i wish i had dropped by sooner. apparently their menu changes seasonally (or something to that effect); so far i've been in during the winter and the spring.  the restaurant itself is pretty small, lending itself to an intimate setting. my only gripe about this is that the first time i went in the winter, i sat at the bar right by the door, and with all the coming and going, it got pretty cold. otherwise, it's a really great atmosphere. the servers were friendly and knowledgeable without being pretentious or condescending. there's a general buzz without being so loud that i can't hold a conversation.  both in the winter and the spring, we started off our meal with the charcuterie board and, at the server's suggestion, the fried mushrooms. let me briefly explain my relationship with mushrooms: i've spent twenty six years of my life hating mushrooms and their weird texture and their weird earthy taste. i've spent twenty six years picking them off pizzas and avoiding them like the plague. but forequarter's mushrooms changed that for me. they were so flavorful and the texture was perfect. i could not get enough. i'd say that i'd go back just for the mushrooms, but that seems a little obsessive, so i'll just talk about the charcuterie now. the board was a bigger hit the first time around, but it was still delicious. during both visits, i shared the entrees with my girlfriend, and it was always more than enough food. in the winter we had the quail and the lamb, and in the spring we had the pork and the ciciones with mushrooms and ramp pesto. all the dishes were great, but the quail and the ciciones especially stand out in my memory. the quail was seasoned well and perfectly cooked. i didn't know what ciciones were before this and our \"adventurousness\" paid off (i realize that this isn't as \"adventurous\" as like, animal guts or testicles, but i'm risk-averse so let me live!). the dish was super flavorful without punching you in the facial with it; it was refined and delicate. in the winter we had a pie for dessert, and in the spring we had rhubarb donuts with goat cheese ice cream (yas kween). every single time i go, everything on the dessert menu always sounds so delicious; i always wish i could have it all. i'm not someone who's normally into sweets or desserts, but i always make room for it at forequarter.   i didn't get a chance to dive into the drink menu too much, but will certainly try to do so the next time around. it sucks that they don't take reservations, but i'm never mad about grabbing a pbr at the caribou across the street before a meal. yes, this place is pretty expensive, but i've never been let down by the experience, and can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"I do believe in paying for ART. I do.  This place makes and serves Food ART. So- if you are ready for that - go here and you will be happy and pleased that someone in Madison is doing art and getting well-paid for it.  Every plate was beautiful to look at and tasty.  The fried mushrooms were good although perhaps they should have been warmer or even hot. The cold-smoked bluefish was interesting, really it was bluefish sushi without any rice- as the smoke flavor was very subtle. The cavatelli pasta \"with lamb\" was disappointing. The sauce was too salty and there were only 3 small shreds of lamb. The meatballs were good, but not extraordinary. Also served semi-warm. When it is below zero and has been for months- isn't HOT food a good thing? just saying. We asked for bread and were given some slices of artisanal baguette that were the teeniest slices I have ever seen. I did not want or expect a big honking bread basket, but still - it seemed stingy. As mentioned in other reviews the Cookie plate was FANTASTIC. Very gorgeous and yummy too. The service was excellent, friendly but not overly attentive. Everything came out with nice timing.   ART is a good thing."}
{"text":"Wow, what a meal.  Best food of a visit that included Merchant, Sardine, and Papavero.  Started out with two amazing cocktails -- Year of the Monkey and John Muir.  First was fruity and complex, the second was herbaceous and tangy.  We loved both.  Mushrooms were as good as reported and eaten as a starter.  Enters were pork chop with miso butter, and lamb with harissa sauce.  Both were cooked perfectly and the sauces added wonderful zing.  We had great red eines you the glass to accompany our entrees.   Dessert was apple clafoutis and the trio of ice creams -- rum, corn, and chocolate mint.  We liked them in that order.  The choco was hijacked by the mint; dark choco or less mint was needed.  Loved the staff and service, prices were appropriate.  We're coming back for more of everything.  Return visit --   So sad to return and be disappointed.  We ordered lots of appetizers, four different entrees, and a couple desserts.  Most of the selections were great, although the pork chop was 40% fat.  However, the ambiance was pretty unbearable.  A large party shrieked and hollered for over two hours so we couldn't hear ourselves think, let alone talk to each other.  The wait staff was unprepared to do anything but bring an endless flow of drinks  to the screaming table.  If not for our confused parents, we would have aborted and gone somewhere else.  If you care about ambiance, pick some place larger with a staff more experienced to control the environment."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Madison for my money. Really interesting cocktails, really fabulous food. Didn't even burn down after I ate there like Underground Kitchen."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love Forequarter. The space is cozy and the cocktails were inventive (especially Pillows in Gardens). But the food really didn't deliver. Everything was over-salted and many of the flavor combinations simply didn't work.  We started with the lamb tartare and market vegetables. The market vegetables were great - earthy and flavorful - but the cranberry and lemon on the lamb tartare was an odd flavor profile. For entrees, my husband had the quail with rutabaga hash. Both were good, but it was over-seasoned. I ordered the beef tongue with farro. The farro was drenched in a strong mustard viniagrette and the beef tongue was void of any flavor, aside from salt. We ordered the cookie sampler for dessert. The macaron was inedibly sweet, the chocolate chip cookie and mint truffle were just ok, but the almond cookie was great - light, airy and a balanced sweetness.  I appreciate the chef's willingness to take risks and try new things, but the menu needs some refinement."}
{"text":"Went to Forequarter for Valentine's Day. It really delivered! The ambiance was fantastic - rustic and intimate. Plates are designed to share, and the portions were just right.  We started with a couple of beers (can't complain about Ballast Point Sculpin!) and started with a cheese plate and meatballs. The cheese plate had this wonderful apple butter, bread, and honey with candied pecans, and the meatballs were absolutely out of this world.  We then tackled a plate of market vegetables with ricotta cheese, potato salad, with a fried egg vinaigrette, and a whole red snapper. The potato salad was one of the best of the meal, and the snapper was so well-done, the fish was falling off of the bones.  Finished up with buttermilk pie and a Chardonnay to top it off.   The food is so well thought out, and every plate we had was incredible. This was by far one of my favorite meals in all of Madison!"}
{"text":"Summary: This meal kicked the crap out of anything I've had in Madison, and it did it without much trouble.  Amazing, service, fantastic food, a terrific bartender, and an incredible experience that easily rivaled my food standard, Battersby. Oh, and the sad thing? We went to Forequarter only after finding out Pig in a Fur Coat was closed.  Stupid, stupid, stupid.  Started with the coffee roasted beets, hibiscus, and topped with buttermilk ice cream, as well as the greens with radishes, turnips, beets and feta. Outstanding.  Then, there was some mythical delay in the kitchen, so they brought out a totally-free-of-charge mini plate with a delicious French cheese, goat salami, and fresh tomatoes. That cheese was killer. And free! Damn.  Dinner: my aunt got the smoked trout, which was out of this world. I got the quail with curry leaf pudding, pickled peaches, and summer squash. A-maz-ing. My uncle got the duck with chili-rubbed corn (I'm pretty sure I'm missing something). All outstanding.  Oh, and THEN, because they forgot to bring it, they brought out the blistered shishito peppers with lemon and parmesan...so. fucking. good. But wait! Because they forgot, that was free too!   Dessert? A chocolate terrine with mint panna cotta and currents? Top notch.  And then the booze--what an awesome bartender! He was making random drinks for us all night, and my dark and stormy was phenomenal. Hell, everything was phenomenal.  If you need some comparisons: Quality was on par or better than L'Etoile, dishes were more delicious than Pig in a Fur Coat, and their ingredient combinations/techniques made Nostrano look pedestrian. Yeah. Really.  Talk about leaving Madison the right way--Forequarter is my top meal of 2013. NYC--you've got your work cut out for you."}
{"text":"Going to Forequarter makes me feel like I live in a real city. I love the dark cozy atmosphere and the interesting cocktails that scream 'mixologist'. The appetizers I've had here are mind blowingly delicious (dreaming of broccoli in shallot vinaigrette), but it loses a star for the comparatively lackluster entrees. The fish dishes have been consistently over-salted for my taste. Overall, I'm glad we have this place to up the foodie ante in Madison."}
{"text":"Good food! Quite expensive food, and not quite worth it. Excellent drinks at reasonable prices, usually good service. \"2009 NYC farm to table hipster\" is the best way to describe this place in 6 words. Can be very busy during peak hours or nice days. Try going early or late to ensure a seat, not good for large groups. The rotating kegged cocktails tend to be a great deal for the quality."}
{"text":"Forequarter is a restaurant in Madison, Wisconsin that takes a refreshing team-based approach at their place. Instead of the chef dominating the creative process, it is owned and operated by a collective. With only 18 seats, the service was excellent. The beer and craft cocktail selection was noteworthy: because of the crushing cold of the polar vortex we were offered mulled cider compliments of the collective at the beginning of our dinner.  We began with house cured pork shoulder, coppa, and a local cheese, accompanied by smoked olives, toasted macadamia, assorted pickled vegetables, two types of mustard, and house baked bread. Everything was memorable. Girlfriend accused me of eating most of the coppa.  For dinner the vegetarian stew in a lemon broth was invigorating. I find the dessert to have been the real stunner, however, for its simplicity. House baked croissant, moist and sweet on the bottom, crispy and rich exterior, with real whipped cream, not sweet, all richness, and tart local apples."}
{"text":"A great eatery. I wanted to visit again this trip but alas, that is no longer an option due to unfortunate timing.mGreat food, nice atmosphere and one of the spots run by the Underground Food guys and gals. You won't get a trough of slop, so go elsewhere if that's your expectation, this was a restaurant of creativity and seasonal variation."}
{"text":"This place should be illegal ! It's so good ! First the ambients really like you would be in a movie or something the experience is great  It's really hard to find places with great vibe and this is it!  Drinks are amaZing like the daiquiri so good and The brisket bourbon ...  Food is solid really good very well thought trough  Fresh !"}
{"text":"delicous, as expected for anything underground foods related. but really pretty damned pretentious, certainly wouldn't stop me going back. the pretension is more worthy of mockery than fear. pretty small inside, the menu is small. it's great but ultimately it's not underground kitchen :("}
{"text":"Very good food in a great setting. I've been here a couple times, having a chance to try a couple salads, some pork, duck and beef. The food has been well prepared, and delicious, although some of the compositions are a bit too out there for my tastes (but what do I know?)  Service is consistently good, and the restaurant itself is very sleek and intimate. I wish that they took reservations, because the place is so small, if you try to go during peak hours your apt to be waiting in your car or outside if it's April-Sep.  I wish I could give it another half star, but the food just doesn't blow me away enough to earn a perfect score. One of my favorites in Madison though, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Started with whitefish beignets, which were perfection - impossibly light despite being fried with a hint of lemon alongside a green garlic dipping sauce. Also had the sobbrasada and the chilled sorrel and sweet pea soup. For the main course had ricotta and herb dumplings which were in a mushroom-y broth surrounded by kale and other greens. For dessert I had the wedding cake, an amazing concoction - green cake (sorrel and peas) with a pink strawberry filling topped with a honey buttercream. Would go back for the beignets and the cake."}
{"text":"The hostess does not greet guests, but instead stands at her podium at the back of the restaurant looking bored with her head propped up on her arm. While i was fine with the ridiculous wait, i was surprised that i was not allowed to sit during the wait- the hostess asked me not to sit and took my chair and mysteriously placed it where no one would later sit. The food is a lot of hype and so so given the price.  The bartenders redeem the place. They are friendly and make fantastic drinks."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Madison. Food is unique and innovative. Drinks range from great craft beers to old style cocktails like sazeracs and boulevardiers. A must-do in Madison."}
{"text":"It is what it is. Expensive new American food with a focus on meat and cheese.The restaurant is small and dimly lit (cus it is hip duh). The food is lovingly prepared and tasty."}
{"text":"We came here as a party of 4 for my birthday. They were incredibly busy on a Saturday night. The wait was something like 2 hours, and they don't take reservations. However, if you leave your phone number, they will kindly let you know about 15-20 minutes before when a table will be ready for you. This allowed us to get drinks downtown by the Capitol before coming back to enjoy our meal.   It was delicious. We ordered their charcuterie board and allowed our server to pick the meats and cheeses. The chicken fried hearts were crispy followed by an offal flavor. Salty and delicious, but not quite my thing. The fried mushrooms were amazing. There was a variety of mushrooms which retained its earthy flavors, but there was a touch too much oil in that dish for me. We also ordered their fish special (I can't remember what kind of fish it was) for the night. The fish was cooked to perfection and we polished it off.   The atmosphere is nice though really very busy. They seated the four of us at the bar area which wasn't preferred, but on a busy Saturday night, we didn't have much choice."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place I wish Madison had more of...and I wish one of those was in my back yard!  The space is small, but they don't make any pretenses otherwise.  Sit at the bar, chat with the barkeeper/server, have a great meal and a super cocktail and get out so the next people can get a spot.    The food is always inventive and impressive.  The charcuterie is a great way to begin.  Blah blah blah, amazing!"}
{"text":"When I went to Forequarter, I had the most creative and delicious vegetarian entree I had encountered in a very long while. In fact, everyone at the table agreed it was the star of the show. It was the \"mushroom croutons\" with lentil sprouts, lime or lemon curd, and balsamic sauce. Amazing! My companions' fish got mixed reviews, but the craft drinks (alc and non-) were top notch."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of hits and a few misses.  We were really surprised at the quality of the food.  I had the sausage plate and my wife had the quail.  Both were very good, the sausage bordered on outstanding.  The charcuterie plate was amazing!  Let me say that again, AMAZING!  I would return for this plate alone. The wine list was smaller, but there were some great drinks on the menu (though they were out of the first one we asked for).  The dessert was a miss, Pumpkin something or another that tasted a bit like a pureed Yankee Candle.  It is small and quaint, doesn't accept reservations and I can see how someone could feel it was pretentious and hipster.  It has a strange mix of Willy's/Johnson street vibe and French hunting lodge food, with taxidermy placed awkwardly throughout.  Overall we really enjoyed the meal but we went early around 6pm and there were plenty of tables open.  From what I have heard the place gets packed later and on weekends, which I could see being a negative given how small it is.  Everyone was very nice and the service was spot on all night, though with only 4 tables seated I would expect that.  The food came out in record time.  We will definitely return but it will not be our new hangout."}
{"text":"Ah, Forequarter. The new-ish venture from the Brothers Hunter could have been the phoenix from the ashes of the late and lamented Underground Kitchen, which barely had time to spread its nascent wings before a kitchen fire took it down, and adjacent businesses and apartments along with it.  Sadly, this is not it. Forequarter feels like the vanity project of a clique of young friends, and while there's not anything wrong with that, per se, the fact is that most people ought not to get fooled into paying the premium prices for its admittedly good food marred by horrendous service and other major flaws.  My experiences at Forequarter (and they have been multiple) have been characterized by terrible serving staff, long waits and high prices. This would be fine if the restaurant could live up to the reputation via charm or exceptionally good food, but the gap is just too large for Forequarter to close, particularly when there are other Madison restaurants that can easily equal or even best it in the cuisine department - I'm looking at you, Nostrano.  Instead, Forequarter ends up feeling like a dilettantes' project; rather than truly feeling like a restaurant that you would, as one reviewer claimed, \"find in Park Slope,\" it feels like one that wishes it were like that. Just like Park Slope? Sure, but only if you've never been there.   On my last, and final, visit, my 45-minute wait was met with a surly server who, wholly inattentive, had trouble recalling what the specials were, pronounced the name of the one cheese she _could_ remember as \"Silton Bleu (bluh),\" and spent the rest of the evening bringing free apps and other comped treats to her tableful of 20-something service industry personnel friends who came in after us, were seated before us, and got food and drink at rates of speed probably double ours.   The food was tasty and passable, I suppose, but who can be bothered to enjoy it in this environment. There's nothing wrong with hipper than thou, but tragically hip is another story entirely. I would welcome a Madison eatery that truly felt exclusive and underground based on experience, ambiance and food quality, but Madison, this ain't it. It's also not Park Slope, Chicago, or the Bay. It's a middling restaurant in a college town charging premium prices for an overall experience verging on mediocre on a good day. Don't drink the Kool-Aid, people. Try 43 North. Try Nostrono. Try cooking at home. But stop lining the pockets of people who are putting you on.   And, for God's sake, do something about that horrendous lettering on your mirrored signs. There are people you can hire who will fix that."}
{"text":"Stunning. Creative. Bold flavors. Mind-blowing combinations of ingredients. Fresh farm to table collective and cooperative.  No bosses....just good food. Damn good food.  My new favorite restaurant.  Sorry L'etoile."}
{"text":"Before Forequarter I truly believed Madison had \"big city quality\" restaurants. Not many, but a few. Forequarter changed my perspective. This place is the real deal and its hard to go elsewhere now. And I mean that.  The food, the space, the music, the lighting, the vibe. All of it. Drinks, menu, inventiveness. I don't gush on Yelp. Forequarter just changed that.   We decided to mix things up and go to Pig in a Fur coat for dessert and while I still like it there (turn the lights down and AC up! Please) the contrast between Pig and ForeQ was pretty eye opening. ForeQ is just a step above the rest.    Watch out L'Etoile, Forequarter is coming for you."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Forequarter has really turned into that place in Madison that people just know you'll have a great meal no matter what. The drinks are delicious and seasonal, just as much as the menu is. I especially love sitting outside on Johnson St on a nice summer night!    They other great thing about them is that they take reservations!!! Madison is filled with places that don't and it is so nice that they do. If I want to spend the money and time to go out to a nice dinner, I'd like to not wait for an hour. This place does it right!!  Lastly, I'll just mention their late night menu, which is also amazing and frequently forgotten about, probably since its a bit away from the crowded bars on the square and state. If you're looking for a good late night snack that's not overrun by college kids, look no further."}
{"text":"Madison! With such amazing culinary establishments as Forequarter, you are the urban equivalent of that shorty girl with more curves than the Monaco F-1 Track, which is what does it for me. That, my reader, is how you cat-call a city.   My date had been singing the glories of this place for weeks, to the point that a very high bar had been built up, and Forequarter gracefully delivered.   The cocktails: we started off with the house-made, kegged French 75, a limey libation infused with herbs and tastefully decorated with a branch of thyme. This could easily become my second signature cocktail after the Dark 'n Stormy, which Forequarter is famous for, but which we could not try because there was no ginger beer (in their case it is house-made). The restaurant had also run out of the goat sausage, but our fun waitress sourced the last butt for us to try, which was enough for us to decide to come back for the full-plate experience.   The deep-fried corn cobblettes with cilantro-sprinkled aioli was the best mazorca composition I have ever had. I loved how my lips felt slightly uncomfortable when placing them on them.  An element of challenge is mostly always welcome in gourmet food,  my dear foodies.   The pulled braised goat was very good too. It was different from what I had experienced before (where I am from, goat is raised eating oregano leaves, so it's already seasoned when it is sacrificed to satisfy. I lie to you not). So, yeah, it was a bit on the drier side of what I was accustomed, but the cucumber, fennel and berries (?) were an excellent complement. I love it when you experience a food you've only eaten cooked in one way in a new fashion.   Other drink/cocktails we had: the grape sampler (I don't remember the name they call it, but it was porto, brandy (?) and Armagnac, closing with three concord grapes. The Manhattan definitely had the man in it, as it was a bitter, strong, non-girlie drink.   I would just ask that our glasses of water are filled more frequently next time, especially because you are going from flavor to flavor and you want to clear your palate to savor each food and cocktail in its most pure expression."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Madison!  (+) My boyfriend and I showed up at 7p on a Saturday night expecting to wait for a table since we had heard this place didn't do reservations. We immediately scored side by side seats at a \"table\" along the wall.   (++) Atmosphere: Man, is this place tiny!! Both intimate and buzzing, from the glowing votives clustered on the tables to the charming tin ceilings, this product of a cooperative food collective (six friends of various backgrounds where no one is owner/CEO) is at the pinnacle of the farm-to-table hip(ster) slow food movement. Comparing this place to similar ventures in Chicago, I was impressed.  (++) Food: My boyfriend and I love to share meals when we go out, so this place was right up our alley, in fact, our server suggested it. We started with one of the specials, a Wisconsin goat style Gouda with pecans, locally sourced sourdough, and a ground cherry jam/compote (I'll be honest I have no idea of the difference) and handcrafted cocktails. Mine was a \"whiskey soda pop\" that had been handmade, kegged, and then bottled at the restaurant (sage and lemon, yes please!). Then there were Carolina shrimp with a pudding and grapefruit (our least favorite). And the quail... Oh, the quail! Salty and succulent with a spread of sauces and pickled peaches so delightful I'll be dreaming of it for a long time. The rainbow trout was incredibly earthy with capers and radishes; it's also not to be missed. Finally, despite protests of distended innards, I ordered dessert. Apricot ice cream and mousse pressed into the shape of a marshmallow with pistachio caramel. Two cups of French press coffee and I was officially comatose. Heavenly comatose.  (-) My only complaint is the IPhone POS system. Super awkward choosing a tip % while my (allbeit very helpful and informed) server stood over my shoulder."}
{"text":"It doesn't get much better than Forequarter for a dining experience.  The food is always inventive and delicious, and the drinks are top notch, whether you drink wine, beer, cocktails, or even soft-drinks.  Seemingly everything on the food and drink menu is made from scratch, down to the vermouth in your martini.  Brunch, dinner, happy hour, late night . . . all winners, and the playlist always fits the mood."}
{"text":"When a 2 inch larvae crawls from your lettuce, onto the table, drops onto the floor, and then tries to inch away, you know it is not going to be a good night.  And it wasn't......"}
{"text":"If Yelp would let me give a 3.5 star review I would, but I'm not worried, this place is so popular they'll be fine. I love the style, of cuisine & atmosphere. It's hip, it's in, the place has a story to tell. The dishes just fell short for me. Mushroom dish - solid, the shiitake mushrooms in particular were fantastic, perfect texture. The cold salmon dish, not for me. Salmon was a bit off & the complimenting flavors too bold. The bread & veggie dish we couldn't finish, once again flavors too bold - salty & charred. And bean texture suggesting they were maybe underdone? The skirt steak special however: PHENOMENAL. Every bite was perfect. Cocktails, solid. Dessert, a Caramelized Croissant, belisimo!   And service was pleasant & knowledgable. Once again, worthy of a higher rating if I could. But those two dishes that missed, one we forced down as not to be wasteful & the other we didn't even try to fake cus we couldn't. You never wanna feel like you wasted money. But all in all, I liked this place. I wish it well, & I'm confident that it will stay hot, as the farm to table movement continues to grip the nation."}
{"text":"It's beautiful and friendly and the food is remarkable and I loved it.  We rolled in and the small room was full, but we had a cocktail from the playful and seasonal list (mine had Elderflower I think and many other light and soothing things.) The lighting is dim and warm and the decor is wood and simple, not country cozy cluttered like a lot of other places I got to visit in my short but heartwarming adventure in Wisconsin. The kitchen is tiny and the menu is created collectively, which might be worrisome to some but don't worry. The result, from the 5 or 6 plates we shared, was a remarkably successful playful balance of flavours that always prioritized deliciousness over everything else, which I applaud with both my hands and happy tastebuds and full belly.   The broccoli dish was exceptional, which is funny to say, but it was somehow the bestest and we agreed we both could eat it every day. The salami and the kohlrabi were savoury and soft and subtle and good, and the plate of cookies at the end was yummy - the bourbon macaron was the best and I could eat a plate piled high with just those please.   All the waiters and staff who circulated and chatted with us seemed comfortable and happy, busy but calm, and generally liking being where they were at, which says a lot. I really enjoyed this a huge whole lot, I'd love to go back."}
{"text":"Eat here! Never had a better meal. Expensive but completely worth it. Menu always changes, service is fantastic, vibe is perfect. A bit hipster to be honest but it's also Madison. A chef collective runs this. I wish I was there right now. So good! Drinks are great too, everyone raves about the Moscow Mules here. I'm a beer drinker so take that with a grain of salt."}
{"text":"Oh man, FINALLY, I made it to an ahh-mazing restaurant in Madison! I've been wanting to try out Forequarter for awhile now, but finally made it there last week.   They don't take reservations, so be prepared to put your  name on a list and hang at the bar for a bit and partake in their delish cocktails! I ordered a lemon cocktail, something like spring fling? I forget, but it was sooo good. Granted, I'm not a huge cocktail drinker, but my boyfriend said his old fashioned was pretty killer, and that's his go-to drink.   For an appetizer, I got the beets and they melted in my mouth! Omg, I actually kept trying to get every last bit using my finger... such a fatty and I didn't even care. We then ordered the potato special app, which was basically potatoes and yummy cheese (can't really go wrong there), and for my entree I got the scallops. with parsnip puree and a lemony sauce. I freaking love a good scallop, and these were some of the best I've ever had! They just melted in my mouth and I could have eaten a whole bucket of them. Is that a thing? Cuz it should be.   We hung around at the bar for awhile, and our bartender was nice, knowledgable, friendly and overall a cool dude. He even hooked us up with a shot. Pretty sure that shot was because he loved my bolo tie, but I'll never know.   This place isn't cheap, but this is the only place in Madison that I've been (except for L'etoile)  that is worth every damn penny.   Can't WAIT to go back!"}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood gathering place. Very hipster and fun. Lots of great gin cocktails. I cannot wait to try the food here!"}
{"text":"Please answer the following questions:  1.) Do you like cheese? 2.) Do you like it when servers, kitchen, and bar staff cultivate an image of unwashed, tattooed intelligence and style that can defeat anything - except their student loan repayments? 4.) Do you prefer it when the kitchen refuses to chop vegetables into bite-sized pieces, forcing you to eat salad in a sensuous fashion with your bare hands? 5.) Do you despise diet beverages? 6.) Do you think basil ice cream served on a wooden plank sounds like a great idea?  Then this is the place for you.  We had a crazy rich gouda to start. Of course we did. It came with a rustic-ass loaf of bread and tart cherry preserves, which we devoured. Then there was salad. Eaten largely with our hands. These people linked their own creative sausages and gave me a delectable mix of vegetables in a broth that was seasoned with delicate herbs and some more of that rustic bread. Yep, the vegetables were too big to cut with a fork, again, forcing me to eat them with my hands. Every bit of what we ate was very, very good. In fact, I think we have a new dining experience on our hands. Literally. Well done.  (Seriously - we love it here.)"}
{"text":"Came back a 2nd time. Experience was just as awesome. But this time I sat outside and took advantage of the nice light to take pics!"}
{"text":"This was an absolutely horrific dining experience, and the meal was amongst the most over-priced, least satisfying I've had. Before someone chastises that statement, let me explain. The dishes my companions and I were served were severely lacking both flavor and originality, and the amount of food we received was disturbingly small. I'm not one that believes a meal has to be a grandiose feast of epic proportions with every garnish under the sky, as there are places that do supremely well with very limited quantities of food (Fresco, for example). This, however, is not one of those cases. The staff was relatively unfriendly and seemingly pre-occupied/uninterested in making sure our needs were met while we dined. At the conclusion of our time there, it was palpably awkward to have our waitress standing over our shoulders while we signed for the tip, a practice that I've literally only experienced on one occassion. I can't, in good conscience, recommend this place to any human being, friend, enemy, or internet stranger."}
{"text":"So after reading these rave reviews, my boyfriend and I decided to try this place to celebrate his birthday. I made reservations about three weeks in advance, noting that we'd really want a table, as we heard that they \"typically\" seat parties of two at the bar, but will try to accommodate requests. The lady I made reservations with said that they'd put that down, so we assumed we'd be getting a table.   The day of the dinner, we walk in, and were asked if the bar seating was okay. I asked about my reservations, and whether we could please get a table instead, but the hostess rudely said that it would have to be at least 9pm before they had an open table, as they *only* keep them for larger parties. Disappointed, we made our way to the bar and perused the menu. Within five minutes of us sitting down, the table of two behind us left. I waited to see whether the hostess would let us know that a table had opened but, but instead, the table was left open for over 15 minutes before another couple walked in and were given the table right away, even though there was bar seating still available. There was another empty double table for at least 4 people open at the window area the entirety of our meal.   This was extremely disappointing, and had greatly ruined our mood before the meal even started.   As for the food, we ordered the whitefish beignets, fried mushrooms, delicata squash and roasted potatoes to start, all four of which were good. As for larger plates, I would not recommend the miso-marinated spring chicken, which came in 3 tiny pieces, hardly larger than my finger, and no miso flavor whatsoever. I also would not recommend the shiitake, ricotta dumplings in broth - the broth was overwhelmingly earthy, and the flavors did not seem to balance well.  Although our bartender/server was very nice, and our appetizer/small plates were delicious (hence the 3 stars, although this is more of a 2.5), the rest of our meal was underwhelming. In addition, until this place can get its seating organization in check, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Brought by girlfriend here for our anniversary. They set a spot aside for us with champagne ready at the table. It was wonderful. The carrot cavatelli was phenomenal. The green chorizo on the sausage platter may have been the best sausage I ever had. Amazing.  Also, congrats to Forequarter for making #12 on Gear Patrol's Top 25 Restaurants in America!"}
{"text":"Nice cocktails.  I liked the slushi which was not too sweet.  The mushroom dish was one of the best things I have eaten in a while- light and crunchy and meaty and savory tasting with a creamy sauce all at the same time.  The cheese special was also delightful.  and who puts icecream on beets?  I love beets and goat cheese but the creativity here was exceptional with beets, ice cream and coffee in one dish.  We would definitely recommend this restaurant to a friend and/or return here.  It was especially nice that we went early on a Monday night so there was no wait.  I imagine the food is probably worth waiting for though."}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday night knowing it would (hopefully) be slower. Walking in, I'd have to say it's a little strange moving to the back to get to the server/host stand, but we were approached by a server which was nice. As a server I understand that if we're in for drinks and an app that occupying a table, especially in a small restaurant, isn't really possible. The server was really nice and we opted to wait for a seat at the bar.  Everyone we talked to was very nice. We put in for drinks with a server and ended up taking a seat at the bar and being served there. The bartender was really nice and very good at answering our questions about some of the food items we were unsure about.  My boyfriend got a bourbon old fashioned, one of the best ones I've tasted, and I got a Gins and Tonic which was perfect and tart. It went very well with the Braunschweiger, which I had never tried before, but was absolutely one of the most delicious foods I have ever had in my whole life. Which might sound sad considering all the amazing food in the world, but it was very true.   There was a perfect blend of toast, liverwurst, onion jam, stone ground mustard, and radish.  We've taken to trying new food and drinks and this is the perfect place to do that. I'd say the only negative is that it's small, but they really do what they can with the space and they very much know what's going on.   Hopefully we will try table service soon and do full entrees. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The slushie you got from the ice cream truck but boozier and $9."}
{"text":"PROS: Savory, flavorful dishes CONS: Monotonous  Relentless assault. That's exactly how I would describe Forequarter. At first, the appetizers tasted tantalizing. Strong, bold flavors. Smokey, heavy. Intriguing. However, as the night went along, dish after dish, there was no relief. All the flavors amounted to the same basic, overwhelming flavors. No sense of fresh air. No puff of spring. No sense of balance. You drown miserably in a viscous pool of smokey tar. The night is long."}
{"text":"My friend and I had a fantastic dining experience here!  We weren't starving, so we shared all of the dishes we ordered and loved them all.  We started with the Potato Profiteroles, fried mushrooms and Cured Salmon.  The profiteroles were light and delicious.  The salmon had a great flavor, and the fir curd tasted great with it.  The fried mushrooms were out of this world good.  Seriously the best mushrooms I've ever had.  They were lightly fried and served in a shallot vinaigrette alongside black garlic smear.  I looked up how to make black garlic when I got home because the flavor was so good!  I could have filled up on those mushrooms and left happy.  We ended with the curry trofie (we had thought trofie was a fish, but apparently it's pasta!) which was also fantastic.  The squash was cooked perfectly.    I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I brought a guest from out of town a week ago for drinks and dinner, and we had a fantastic time. While it wasn't my first time here, I was reminded how pleasantly surprised I always am by their friendly staff. Luckily we didn't have to wait long (it was slow around 8:30 on Wednesday) but I imagine on weekends it can get busy.  We shared the sausage platter ( the mustard alone was to die for), the market veggies, and a few smaller plates including a cheese selection to get started. Drinks were delicious (they make a mean dark and stormy) and while I was too full for dessert, the table next to us had what looked like an amazing assortment of cookies.  I've moved to the near east side of town, so I can confirm that I will be returning as often as I am able."}
{"text":"Food here is on-par with the best in Madison (L'etoile, Nostrano...)  We had avoided this place due to the no-reservations policy (we want to eat when we want to eat!) but noticed that they DO take reservations on Sundays.  Not too much to say beyond the fact that everything we had was great, and this this is the kind of place where I am sure I would like anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Regretfully, I can't give this place a 5 star review like many other yelpers have. But let's start with the positives! Forequarter is extremely innovative. They have creative ideas about what to put with each dish, food consistency, textures, etc. Secondly, the place is pretty hip. With a location right off Willy street that is to be expected. However, I just wasn't in love with the place. The menu is very small. We started off with Pork Rillette. Which is a pork spread with lard on top of it that you spread on to toast points. To me, the dish lacked flavor. The next dish we tried was beef tongue. Again, just not very impressive. Maybe Beef tongue just isn't for me. Third, we tried lamb meatballs which were probably the best dish we had of the night. They were cooked to perfection and the sauce went perfectly. Lastly, we had trout served with greens and fried beats. They served the fish with the skin on covered in greens and it made it difficult to share. Unfortunately, I can't say anything I had here was fabulous and I walked out with a $200 bill for two people. I like the concept, and the food was ok, but a little too eccentric for me."}
{"text":"I finally got over to Forequarter last night and was very impressed.  We came around 8:45 and had to wait twenty minutes for a party of 6, which isn't bad at all. The place is small and we were put in the dark as night back hall with the bathrooms to wait which was kind of weird, but they took our drink orders from there instead of us having to go to the bar which was good.   The place itself reminds me of an upscale tavern or something. Maybe a speakeasy. It's dimly lit and sort of minimalist but very comfortable.   Once we were seated the service was very good. Our food came out quickly and our waitress was really nice and not pretentious at all. They don't split checks as a policy, which a lot of servers at upscale restaurants have even told me is the most bogus thing ever, but she was willing to put different amounts on each of our cards so that was helpful.  The food was FANTASTIC. I got the fried poussin which was tender, flavorful and went perfectly with the polenta it was served with. Others got the steak which they loved and the pork belly. A few complained that the portions were a little small, but nobody didn't love what they ate.  I also ordered the Elderflower cocktail. It was pretty tasty but wasn't that unique. Not quite at the level of say Tornado Room's cocktails, but they had some good interesting other options.   I can't wait to go back and try something new from the constantly evolving menu. Hoping the next experience brings it up to 5 stars as it's pretty darn close!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. The portions are on the small side. Service was the biggest issue. I get that the place is both popular and small and doesn't do reservations. However the wait was longer than stated, and it started to feel like they had forgotten us. They pushed the drinks to the point where a few of us felt like maybe they thought we were weird for not wanting any. The waitress hovered while the tip was selected, which felt very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"After our first visit to Forequarter, I am sure that it will be our last.   The food was not as good as I expected. To be honest, it was horrible. We went for dinner on Saturday around 5:30 pm. Although the restaurant was not crowded, we had to wait for a long time for our first dish, which was the deep fried mushroom that everyone raved about. Also, it felt like forever for the main dishes to arrive at the table. I've been to many $$$ restaurants, and personally I felt that with the $$$ standard, the service was unacceptable.   Let's talk about the food. The deep fried mushroom was overwhelmingly bitter. The deep fried mushroom was not crunchy at all. It was hard to believe because it was deep-fried. The black garlic sauce was so bitter that after I finished it, all that left was bitterness down my throat, as if I just chewed and swallowed medicine.   For the main course, we each got something different. One of us got the pasta, which was mediocre. The pasta was cooked al-dente but there was nothing else in it except the pasta and mushroom. Another friend of mine ordered the slow cooked pork belly, it was quite burnt just from its appearance. The flavor was okay, nothing really stood out. I ordered the koji marinated poussin, which I was told to be a bird, similar to chicken. When the waitress handed me the plate, I was so close to ask her if it was burnt and asked to bring it back to the kitchen but I didn't say anything since we waited too long for the food and we had somewhere else to go to afterwards. I am not a professional cook, but I know the difference between a charred piece of meat and a burnt one. My three pieces of poussin were completely burnt. I understand that it could be due to the koji marinating, but it was still unacceptable for me with the standard of this restaurant. They say your appetite increases when you see a pretty plate of food, this whole experience so far at Forequarter was a big let-down. My poussin dish was very unappetizing to look at, let alone I have to eat it because it costs $22. The meat was also completely dry and flavorless.  At the end of our dinner, I decided to ask the waitress why the poussin was so burnt. Her response blew my mind, \"It's supposed to be how BBQ meat is like.\" I laughed in my mind, \"Yeah right, between a charred BBQ meat with a nice caramelization and a burnt one, which one would you eat?\" Oh well!  If you care for your health (burnt food gives you cancer) and don't want to spend $$$ on food that doesn't match its restaurant's reputation, please do yourself a favor, and don't come here."}
{"text":"No more 'bou burgers. And now I have a new favorite restaurant in Madison. And it has great cocktails too. If only it were open 24h a day."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a happy hour gal. Forequarter could change that. Arrived at 4:28pm for the 4:30 open. Waited half a minute and in I went. I was eating solo and not sure how that would go. Christian the bartender was the right guy for an out of towner grabbing dinner at the bar. Nice guy and just the right amount of friendly. Knows his stuff. Ordered the happy hour burger and the mushrooms off the dinner menu. The griddled patties are old school before gentrification morphed them into half pounders with tons of stuff on 'em that frequently don't deliver on flavor but hey who's thinking about that when you are distracted by size. Not so here. Burger is beef, made no mistake. Can't hide the beef in the old school burger. Homemade American cheese, really what is that anyway? I'll tell ya friends, it's Make American Great Again!!! Fantastic is what it is, buttery goodness beautifully melted. Add the slightly sweet pickles and horseradish sauce and that's how you balance burger toppings.  So have yourself a burger or two and a great beer. Life is good."}
{"text":"This is my kind of place. When you walk in it looks like a cozy bar but was packed on a weekend. They take your name and will call when your table is ready so you can go grab a drink nearby (limited options but we had time to snag a quick drink at Sujeo a few blocks away). At first I wasn't too excited to sit at the bar when they were ready for us. But that all soon melted away. Great cocktails. Wine list that was pretty easy to navigate. But, most importantly, amazing food. Our server was really helpful in giving us suggestions, but I don't think you can go wrong here. I had a pork loin with a smoked apple that was one of the best combos of things I have ever had. So simple, but just out of this world tasty. The charcuterie board we had was amazing and huge and had things that even an adventurous eater like me doesn't love but did this time around (headcheese). The amazing attention to details, quality ingredients paired with a laid back vibe and clear love of food makes this one of my favorite places I have dined. It's a rare and wonderful treat!"}
{"text":"Unreal.   I won't waste too many words blubbering over how great this place was. What I will say is that I've eaten at a lot more expensive places with a lot more \"stars\" and James Beard awards and I could not believe the level of food here. I would easily drive hours or even fly to eat here again."}
{"text":"I'm dreaming about the day I get to go back here. Serious visions of those beets and mushrooms dancing in my head. And the good news is I don't have to save for months to do so, because forequarter.. my friend... is affordable. (And I'm beyond grateful for that.)  We began with the cheese plate served with house made peach, raspberry & almond jam that tasted like pure fall. (Move over psl chicas in your uggs.)  I put my foot down with the beets cooked with coffee & rye. Served warm over cocoa & hibiscus, micro greens & buttermilk ice cream. The mixture was simply devine.  The mushrooms... the lightly fried oyster & shiitake mushrooms with pickled Serrano peppers, sprouted lentils, salted lime curd & balsamic reduction. Had that miraculous concoction not been served on a wooden board, I surely would have licked the serving platter clean.  And then they had croissant cake for dessert! CROISSANT CAKE!!!   It was a happy birthday indeed. Thank you forequarter. Thank you.  If you are even considering going here, put down your computer, ipad or mobile device & head towards 708 E Johnson. Now. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Our waiter had no knowledge of the food or drinks. Maybe it was his first day, but it was frustrating that we had to look things up on our phones. The food was amazing, and maybe worth the cost. The most frustrating thing was the size of the drinks. They come in comically small glasses. They're the size I give my 2 year old to drink out of. I'm not saying I want a 16oz big gulp, but the volume is 1/3 of that at other comparable restaurants who serve the same quality drinks. This and the poor staff overshadowed the amazing food."}
{"text":"Simply amazing. Quaint, romantic, and delicious. The service is attentive, the food is local and creative."}
{"text":"by far my favorite place in madison.  possibly one of the best dining experiences i've ever had.  love this space and love the place."}
{"text":"I am so excited that Underground Food Collective opened up this new restaurant! It's not meant to replace Underground Kitchen, which closed last year after a fire, but it's definitely filled that gap in Madison for inventive farm-to-table food.   My husband and I came on a Saturday evening during their first week being advertised as open, about 7:45, and were told we'd have a half hour wait. The space is small -- tables for about 20-25 plus bar seating -- and has plenty of natural light, dark wood, and kitschy taxidermic decor (not so much to offend our vegetarian sensibilities).  We ordered a couple of cocktails and waited by the windows, where a ledge for drinks and candles provided a nice space to hang out. I got a martini, listed on the menu as having Death's Door gin (local!), sherry, and pickled ramps. How could that not be delicious? My husband got a manhattan with rye and cucumber in it, which was an interesting way to turn a very wintery drink into something appropriate for the summer. We both liked my martini a bit better than his manhattan.  When we were seated, we ordered a great bottle of wine and four plates to share, as the menu is small-to-medium servings. We started out with a local cheese plate, which featured a local camembert-style cheese that was complex and wonderful, along with little toasts, strawberry (and some herb that I can't remember) jam and some lavender sprigs. The cheese was plated on a thick board of wood and was very aesthetically pleasing. Next, we shared an early summer salad of pea vines, radishes, snap peas, and feta; a roasted carrot dish made with young carrots, pecans, and a sharply flavored yogurt sauce; and a shiitake mushroom dish with dandelion shoots and pickled fruit (this was meant to be served with chicharrones, but they were happy to make it vegetarian for us). Everything tasted incredibly fresh, earthy, and unique, with flavor combinations that are clearly meant to contrast and surprise you. We finished off the meal with a trio of lemon chiffon tarts: blueberry, strawberry, and raspberry. They were a perfect finish to our rather large dinner -- light, bright, and delicious.  The pricing seems very fair for what they provide. The plates and cocktails range from $8-12 each.  Forequarter pulled off all of the dishes wonderfully. My only suggestions would be to make more of their vegetarian dishes vegan-friendly and to get some more bike-parking options outside the restaurant. I can't wait to see what they come up with next as the seasonal produce changes!"}
{"text":"It's places like Forequarter that make me wish \"hipster chic\" was a category on Yelp... really. It's so full of cool even the cuffed slim red pant and denim shirt unbuttoned like I just don't care I was wearing made me feel sort of lamesies in a sea of hip and happening. Seriously, everyone who eats there is hip. The bar is hip. The tables are hip. The plates are hip. It's hip that they have this fine-ish dining setup going but use paper napkins [1] and mismatched silverware [2]. It's hip that they make ice cream to order! [3] So hip I need to footnote this review, and that's hip. But don't fret if you don't sport swagger, the place is accessible for those that wear glasses because they have to and don flannel because it's practical.   We arrived around 7 and were told it would be 30 minutes for a table. NBD, there are plenty of seats at the bar and a cocktail menu that'll take even the surest of imbibers time to get through. I landed on a delicious apple brandy cocktail that I snapped so you can see it and read all the deets. Just as soon as our drinks arrived, maybe 5 minutes after we arrived, a table opened up. And this folks is when ish gets real.   Forequarter has a tidy menu of 12 or so items. They range in price from 4 to 17 bucks and all are meant to share. I think. I mean I get bored after two minutes of the same thing, so I think all dishes ought to be shared. We started with a charcuterie plate, a special that night which came with Genoa salami, two kinds of mustard, giardiniera, sliced bread and a fennel apple salad. It was amazing. I wish their was more bread to sandwich the plentiful amount of meat, but I knew we had more coming. Mushrooms were next, four kinds of wild fungus mixed with some greens and toasted bread... we'll call those croutons. ;) [4] Next up were the lamb meatballs served with perfectly cooked lima beans. What do I mean by perfectly cooked? I mean al dente; nice chew but not raw. From there we moved on to the squash cavatelli, the standout winner. Take a fun pasta, add some crispy pieces of squash, grated cheese and a fried egg and life is good. We rounded out our meal with a rich chocolate ice-cream that was pretty bomb for ice cream. It was served with a raspberry fruit leather and the best almond cookie I've ever eaten. Don't go there tomorrow for it. They rotate their desserts every night [3].   All in all it was an awesome trip and I'm excited to go back. I don't think I've ever been to a restaurant and liked reading every option on the menu, and I can only guess as the weather cools, some warm and cozy things will find their way to Forequarter post fall.   [1] I used to gripe about paper napkins and now I sort of feel like a. I'm wiping my mouth on the thing, do I care if it's cloth and b. I have to think it's much more green to go paper than to go cloth and use harsh solvents and water to clean. So I say viva paper.   [2] My dessert spoon was just like a set we had growing up. I wanted to steal it, but then I thought, \"I'd only have one!\" Not \"It's wrong to steal\" but \"what would I do with one?\"  [3] How do you make ice-cream to order? Nitrogen. The base is made that day and contains egg, so it's more of a custard when it starts. An order comes in, nitrogen cools the custard and makes for a thick and creamy texture, and tada... delivered to your table is a cool creamy treat make seconds earlier. They aren't stuck with a bunch in the freezer at the end of the night like oh I dunno everywhere else that serves ice cream and keeps it on hand. And they can get through a base in a night (because it rocks) and swap in a new sweet treat nightly.  [4] It's ripped, it's toasted, it's bread. And their tongue and cheek play on Corey's favorite carb was noted. Bravo 4qtr."}
{"text":"This is a great place to experience and we recommend sitting at the bar. The bartenders are gifted at their craft and fun to talk too. Their speciality drinks are outstanding and they always are rotating them. Their food is an experience too and it's nice to be able to try different, new, and flavorful food. Always a fun night!"}
{"text":"Yes. Just yes. Always.  We love going here with a bigger group and sharing e.v.e.r.y.t.h.i.n.g on the menu.   It's small, so I assume they have some major wait times occasionally but we have somehow always avoided that.   Anxiously awaiting warm weather for the return of their shaved ice cocktails and quaint outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Flavor seems to be so lacking these days at most establishments. Not here at Forequarter. They use seasoning the way it should be used. So began my Monday night out, in food mecca Madison, with my good friends who said this is their favorite restaurant. Well I'm now a believer and soon I must go back for dinner at Forequarter.    We came in around 4:30 at opening to be treated to the Forequarter happy hour, which consists of the following choices: House made crackers, which are so crisp, so flavorful and just damn good. Also serving during happy hour, the house tacos, with house made shells. Wow! Such a solid twist on such a simple food item. Served in twos don't sleep on this taco. Now on to the star, the house made burger for only $5 per. I ate three of them. They aren't small but they aren't a full size burger. Double patty and cooked a perfect medium, these little bad boys had a super savory sauce, tart pickles and a bomb cheese all on a well-seasoned soft bun! Hot damn these were so good.  Presentation of the food wasn't shabby either. Everything came out on a butcher's block, which is shabby sheik in my book. The atmosphere was also nice. It's a cozy little restaurant tucked into a cozy little Madison neighborhood in the city!   To say I left stuffed was an understatement, I was straight full to the hilt off happy hour. Sitting there watching dinner come out I was impressed and must come back to try the other goods. Madison has never done better than it's doing at Forequarter. I am a fan!"}
{"text":"This place was a lot of fun. I was impressed by the experience and the variety of food; but it comes at a price so I would probably only go here for a special occasions, or if you are a wealthy oligarch."}
{"text":"The best meal I've had in Madison to date. They only take reservations on Sundays so if you don't like waiting for a table (which you'll have to do since the secret is out and the space is small) go on a Sunday.   I'm sure the menu changes with the season, but if you go and they still have the radishes on the menu you must get them. So simple (just radishes, butter, salt, herbs) but so fresh and delicious. We also got the friend mushrooms (these aren't the friend mushrooms you're thinking of), roasted vegetables and ciccione. All of it was fantastic. I can't remember what we had for dessert but I do remember swooning over it. Add fantastic service and cute space and you've got 5 stars. Honestly, I might even be willing to wait in line on a Friday or Saturday for this place.   My new favorite."}
{"text":"Wow. Forequarter is by far my favorite restaurant in Madison.  I kept walking by with my dog, wondering what was going on in that small space, given that there's no exterior sign and no indication as to what it is. I finally googled the address and discovered the hidden gem that is Forequarter. I'm ashamed, but excited, to say that I went two nights in a row =)   First night, on a Thursday, only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table at 7pm. Started off with a Martini while we waited. With the pickled ramp (had to google ramp =), it was delish! The designers of the space were smart when the constructed 6 inch shelves sticking out in the waiting area. Perfect to set a drink or a small plate.  We ordered the grilled bread, which was fantastic, and the cheese plate special. The bread (very large portion served on a rectangular wooden board) was accompanied by a homemade pesto, which was delicious. Cheese came with pickled vegetables. After the bread and cheese, unfortunately, we were full so called it a night.  Second trip on Friday (around the same time) had to wait around 20 minutes for a table, but again, had a drink while waiting. Ordered the bread again (amazing!), roasted corn, and roasted carrots. The roasted corn was a little spicy and came with a cilantro lime aioli...heavenly. The roasted carrots were tasty but could have been cooked a little longer.   Overall, I LOVE Forequarter. Unique, high quality dishes. Reasonably priced. Busy but not too busy. I will return as soon as I can!"}
{"text":"Pretentious to the extreme, HIGHLY overrated, and hilariously overpriced. The cheese board--for 12 bucks we got maybe 3 ounces of cheese, some nuts, tough slices of rye bread, and some crappy pureed apple \"jam\"--was the tiniest I have ever been served.The almost 10 dollar tequila drink (the Paloma) tasted like a typical greyhound (pepper in water? Whatever.)   The staff were rude as shit. Completely unhelpful, and unfriendly as well. Dilettantes project indeed. Wow, you have a centrifuge! How nice for you. Watching all of the staff standing around yakking away just made us roll our eyes. Madisonians are suckers for this kind of wanna-be urban hipster crap and it is just embarrassing. Lah de fucking dah, suckers.  Afterwards, we went across the street to The Caribou, were greeted by a friendly bartender and served promptly."}
{"text":"Items Selected: Coffee Egg Cream - Cold Brew Dogwood Coffee, Cream, Honey, Lemon, Egg White Cold Brew Dogwood Coffee Goat Sausage with Crispy Baguette, Mustard, and Olives Galantine of Poussin stuffed with cabbage and almonds - Mustard Greens, Pickles, and Olives Caramelized Carrot Cavatelli and Roasted Carrots with Carrot Top Pesto and Parmigiano Reggiano Malt Ice Cream with Crushed Potato Chips, Crystalized Kumquats, White Chocolate Crisp, and Hot Fudge  Ostensibly a sequel to the oft-lamented Underground Kitchen with a meat heavy menu featuring daily specials from Madison's heralded Underground Butcher it was for a few pre-dinner bites that I sat down at a tiny two-top at Forequarter and although my pending reservation at L'Etoile would indeed limit my order I'd be hard pressed to say which experience was more impressive.  Without doubt a trendy space, heavily wooded with tiled ceilings and taxidermy, it was just after 5:30 that I entered the dimly lit dining room and with the bar already buzzing as several tables dined on charcuterie it would not be long before a menu was in hand and selections were made, the service proving exemplary in both keeping my water glass full and presenting each plate with ample descriptions of sourcing as well as technique.  Unfortunately beginning the night on a sour note, literally, as lemon ruined an otherwise delicious sounding egg cream it was with the beverage stricken from the bill and replaced by cold brew that the meal was reset and although perhaps a bizarre 'pairing' for charcuterie I'm happy to say the bitter contrasts surprisingly worked - a board of boldly spiced goat sausage first perfuming my palate with smoky notes only to be followed by tender poultry imbued with earthy aromatics and extremely subtle brine.  Realizing coffee would overwhelm my main course and thus cleansing my palate with pickles plus tiny olives that packed some seriously salinity it was onward to a vegetarian-friendly bowl of pasta that my meal progressed and with hues of purple, orange, and green in full effect the flavor was even more impressive than the visual display - each tender noodle rife with natural sweetness while butter-roasted Purple Knights and decisive pesto melded into a nutty, rich sauce.  At this point unable - or at least unwilling - to eschew dessert it was between a plate of cookies or a housemade sundae that I was left to decide and deferring to my waitress as to which she preferred I opted for the later, fond childhood memories of the movie-snack \"Whopper\" brought forth with every bite."}
{"text":"Astonishing place!  Every time we go we are surprised by new dishes made with fresh seasonal ingredients with a wonderful combination of flavors, textures and wit.  This is our favorite restaurant in the Midwest (beating shallow show spots like Alinea to a pulp) and rivals places like Tilth in Seattle for our top spot overall."}
{"text":"Well, right off the get go let me say I'd like to make this a 4.5 star review but since that's not an option I have to go with four stars. There were a couple small but notable things that could have been better and made this slightly less than 'as good as it gets'.   I made reservations for two for Forequarter on Valentine's Day. Given the small size of the restaurant and the holiday we were happy to get any reservations (even if they were for 5pm). We arrived a bit early and were directed to the Caribou bar across the street for a pre-dinner cocktail. When we walked back across the street at 5 several tables were already seated and we were shown to a small table for two. Our coats were taken to be hung and we looked over an impressive bar menu and a dinner menu that was especially exciting. We ordered quite a few things so we could try different options and we ran across some really amazing things, as well as a few that could have been a bit better.   Drinks: Elmer T Lee + house ginger beer. This was the first thing I ordered and it was mildly disappointing. Elmer T is a nice bourbon and it was completely lost in the drink. The ginger beer was quite good but the drink as a whole was unimpressive. My wife enjoyed a glass of Sauvignon Blanc that was solid but somewhat unremarkable.   Charcuterie plate: We got the three meat option with lots of pickled veg on the side. This was a really tasty way to begin the meal. We ordered the lomo, coppa, and sopprasata. Before the board arrived at our table we were informed that the last serving of sopprasata had already been ordered and asked if a replacement of dried goat salami was okay. All the pickled veg was delicious (although the purple cauliflower was very heavy on the anise). The lomo was silky, the coppa perfectly salty, the two together PERFECT! We pretty much cleared the entire board, including the full grain and Dijon style mustards. What a way to start a meal!   Appetizers: Green chorizo and butter beans. Wow, this is an INCREDIBLY tasty dish. The gravy was rich and deep and perfectly complimented the smooth texture of the beans. The chorizo is bursting with amazing flavors; herbal, spicy, meaty, fatty, all at the same time. Every component of the dish perfectly complimented the others. This was exceptional!   Fried mushrooms with black garlic. WHOA! This is ASTOUNDING! I'd read a ton about it elsewhere on Yelp, so I won't belabor the point here, but this is a phenomenally delicious dish! There's umami galore in this dish and I would guess anchovy paste is in there somewhere. Whatever it is and however they make it it's DELICIOUS! This is a must have!  Turnip tart. This one was a slight miss, but could be corrected pretty easily to be quite good. The pastry was excellent; light, flaky, delicious, and both the onions and cheese on top were a plus. The turnips on the other hand seemed to have NO seasoning whatsoever. The texture was nice I can see where the dish was headed, but the execution of the turnips left something to be desired. Even a bit of salt would have made the turnips more 'turnip'y' and the dish as a whole far better.  Entrees: Lamb roulade with root veg pave and pancetta aioli. This was a an excellent lamb dish! By appearance alone I might have guessed the lamb was slightly overdone, but the taste and texture proved otherwise. The lamb was tender and succulent with nary a trace of gaminess. In general I'm not much of a aioli fan, but in this dish it added a TON of flavor and a richness that was hugely desirable. The pave was amazing! On the plate it looked a bit like a brick, but the taste and texture paired perfectly with the lamb. The pave added a crunch that hugely benefited the dish as a whole. the way it was plated allowed a bit of the jus from the lamb to soak into the bottom of the pave and every bite was AMAZING! One piece of my roulade was served with a piece of twine still wrapped around it, which was a very minor detail and easily fixed. This was the only detail less than spectacular about the whole dish.   Black garlic glazed chicken with roasted carrots. This was a good dish that just didn't quite click for me. The black garlic glaze had a great depth of flavor but was a little on the sweet side for me. The chicken is served more rare than many folks will be used to seeing it, but that allows it to be hugely moist. I like the flavor of chicken when it's cooked a little more thoroughly, but that's just me. The carrots were very tasty and added a nice texture contrast to the chicken but for me this entree couldn't hold a candle to the lamb. By no means was it bad, it was just over shadowed.  Dessert: blood orange cake with pink peppercorn ice cream. The cake was great but the ice cream was ASTOUNDING! We both loved the way it tingled in the mouth and put a perfect cap on a really solid meal.   All in all a great meal with a few, minor missteps. I could certainly see returning to Forequarter in the future. Well worth the $!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to my by the B&B at which I was staying. I arrived a little after 6pm, and it was not busy at all. By the time I left, it was full of people and good energy!  I started with a New Glarus Two Women (only in Wisconsin... and Chicago) and a special cheese platter with a Wisconsin bleu cheese, jam, bread, nuts, and a slice of honeycomb. Shamazing. For my main dish, I decided to go with the carrot cavatelli, roasted carrots, and carrot top pesto. You'd think it'd be carrot overload, but no. It was a great blend of flavors with only a little carrot taste to it all! I finished of with their cookie platter and a walnut liquor with coffee and cream.  Worth every calorie! When you're going to indulge, it should be a place like this: great atmosphere, great ingredients, minimal processing, and straight up deliciousness. So glad I followed the recommendation. I hope you follow mine!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I enjoyed ourselves this morning, we sampled a number of their brunch items. I started with their house made bloody Mary and he started with their dogwood French press coffee. I found the bloody Mary to be spicy, and I have an easily identifiable horseradish flavor, however I did not have any chunks of texture and that was a nice detail. My husband was impressed with the accoutrements served alongside his coffee; the natural cane sugar and cream, both in tini mason jars. We ordered the daily muffin, which was not on the menu and should never be overlooked. Inside was a perfectly cooked soft boiled egg and the muffin itself was so airy and light and fluffy that it blew both of our minds. Next, we ordered the breakfast potatoes and those were also delicious. They had a creamy sauce but we're not smothered in them, and I thought that was a great touch, and dollops of mustard seed. Lastly, for our entrées my husband ordered the cheese grits, poached eggs and brats from the underground butcher, all perfectly executed. I ordered the cured trout and the soft scrambled eggs with an herb salad; however, the entrée did not come with an herb salad (see photo). I'm now really disappointed about this but until actually creating this yelp review I hadn't noticed it. Everything we had there was incredibly delicious."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the waitress took a sip of my wife's drink as she was walking towards our table. My wife told her that she couldn't believe what she had just seen, and all the waitress said was that the drink was a \"good choice.\" No apology! Nothing! Unbelievable! She didn't even offer to refund the cost of the drink, or have a new one made. We left. No tip for the waitress. No return trip planned. There has got to be something wrong with a restaurant that would employ a waitress who feels that behavior is okay."}
{"text":"Food:  2 stars  Drinks:  4 stars  Service:  3 stars  Ambiance:  4 stars (would be five, but the noise made hearing the server impossible)  My dining companion and I had been dying to try Forequarter for quite some time, and we finally pulled it off last night.  We both left sated, but underwhelmed.    The trout was the highlight of the meal, with the cheddar cheese plate coming in second.  My spare ribs were a huge disappointment--particularly the texture, which was tough and difficult to consume.    Service gets a few demerit points for not bringing a steak knife with spare ribs.  I know that this may seem like a common practice, but these spare ribs were extremely tough and two other diners at the bar asked for steak knives, so she should have gotten the hint by then.    Part of the trout dish was also undercooked badly--the fingerling potatoes.  That's pretty bush league in my book.  One of them was inedible it was so raw.    Cute place, great drinks, and fantastic concept--but someone needs to work on the quality of the meats and the execution in the kitchen.  If this is a \"five star\" place in your mind, you need to get out more, my friend."}
{"text":"So f@&$ing good!  That's exactly what he said in response to the $5 happy hour burger. Maybe the best burger in town in the last 25 years"}
{"text":"Had three meals here and none were bad. Very intimate (tables close to one another) and they don't take reservations - but I guess that's part of the charm.  Menu changed every time we went so it's an adventure. The waiters' suggestions were always reliable. We usually order about 4 dishes and share. Has always worked out."}
{"text":"Definitely in my top 10 in Madison. I like to come here with a group of five or six to share four or five small plates and one or two larger ones. Favorites: fried shiitake, and braised pork belly. Their house ginger beer's pretty nice, too.  It is a bit small on the inside, so be prepared to come early/late, or wait a bit."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with easily the best cocktails in Madison. Cute atmosphere. There is often a very long wait, though, so it pays to show up early or be prepared to go to the bar across the street for 90 min while you wait. At the end of the day, though, it's always the first restaurant I recommend to people when they come to town.   Also, they do a killer Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations going into Forequarter and they did not disappoint. Our server was exceptionally friendly and helpful without being overbearing. Our cocktails and entrees were majestic landscapes of flavor. The portions were a little small, but we also split a couple of appetizers so we left satisfied without being too full. Great place for a date, even with sitting at the bar. I'm surprised that other people are so quick to chastise in their reviews over a single grievance. Take their emotions with a grain of salt."}
{"text":"Had the trout. This place blew me away. I was not expecting to find this jem and I'm glad I did. I ate at the bar and would recommend doing the same if its your first time."}
{"text":"Someone give this place a Michelin Star.  I went to a New American restaurant last night and was reminded of Forequarter.  The restaurant was decent, but I just kept recalling how amazing my meal was at Forequarter.  There are so many restaurants trying to be similar to Forequarter in Seattle, but they are just not successful.  I just don't know how Forequarter can improve.  It is that amazing, and it is worth a trip back to Wisconsin to relive that experience."}
{"text":"I'm torn. It's a solid 4, but can be 4.5. I've had an amazing meal here and I've had meals that on the one hand were interesting, but left me wanting more (and needing more to eat).  Since it's a constantly changing menu with different chefs in the kitchen it's hard to pinpoint specific dishes, but that's one of the cool things about this place is that you'll always find something new and thought provoking.   Their late night beef sandwich has consistently delivered and challenges (but not quite beats) the Tornado Rooms steak sandwich as the best late night food in Madison."}
{"text":"This is where I had my first carob pie/tart dessert it was yummy. The outstanding feature of this location is how creative they are with the vegetables, yes vegetables. For a meat lover I am ok with and wish there are more restaurants like this. It was a $50 dinner after splitting with 2 other gals but was a tasty and memorable eat!"}
{"text":"I've driven this street scores of time over the years when visiting my daughters at UW, and never noticed this building.  Maybe the iconic Caribou Tavern across the street draws my eyes everytime.  But that changed with Forequarter arriving.  The mixologist behind the bar was engaging and prepared phenomenal drinks.  I tried his version of an Old Fashion and Manhattan.  Wow.  Familiar yet different and better than what I've experienced.  Watching him in action was also part of the experience.  So focused, high volume, yet all bespoke work...except for the pre-made cocktails.  I only sampled one from the tap and it was \"off\" that night according to the mixologist.  I still like the idea of kegging drinks and will try one next time I'm around.  I'll reserve judgement on the food until my next visit.  I enjoyed the fried chicken but I don't think it is a signature dish for them.  My wife and daughter loved their vegetarian option.  Unique selections with great ingredients for everything I saw.  There is thinking in the kitchen.  Learned later they have received some national attention.  Based on my experience they deserve yours."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Madison for a date night or intimate meal with a friend. Best for small groups and I love eating at the bar. Awesome fresh cocktails and the food is outstanding. Always new stuff to try and can always count on a fabulous charcuterie? board when in doubt. Sooo happy I live just a walk away!"}
{"text":"So came in on a Thursday night, 545. Wanted to sit at the bar, like we always have, to have some drinks and a few small plates but we're  asked if we had a reservation; to just sit at the bar? Isn't that what the bar is for, non-reservation, wait for a table, a few drinks, etc? Pretty disappointed that we need a reservation to eat here now. Unfortunately probably won't be back because we usually just like to hit a few spots, not commit to one place, but this was definitely one of our go-to's for great drinks and good food. Too bad, pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Outstanding!!!!  The collective keeps developing new ideas and is becoming a local food mecca.  I went as a group of four just prior to Christmas and tried all but 2 items on the menu.  Their menu is concise and artfully described, but limited to about 16 items in all.  I tried everything, but my favorite part of my meal was those cheesy potatoes, sounds so Midwestern, but when they use Rush Creek Reserve .... I need not say more.  I happen to add a little extra of that cheese sauce to the braunsauger.    Day after our feast we headed to the Underground Butcher for take home memories of our meal!"}
{"text":"Forequarter has everything I have wanted from restaurants in the genre of the local, slow food movement. It lived up to all of my dreams of taking Wisconsin cheeses, meats, and local harvests and pairing things from the delicate to the bold spectrum.  I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to discover what is, to me, truly Wisconsin.  The food was delicious, the candles were placed well, the staff seemed real and approachable, the food came at good intervals, and the experience was casual but with a very high quality.  I could go on and on, but you need to just go try this place."}
{"text":"We were up and down on this place as the meal progressed, but finally came down to no. We decided to order one of the small plates as an appetizer and then two dinner plates for the main course. We started with a small plate of fried mushrooms, and they were spectacular -- shitakes fried until crispy around the edges and served in a garlic-shallot vinaigrette.   Then the main courses came. My wife ordered whitefish. The bite she shared had a distinct fishy taste, but the celeriac was perfectly cooked. Can't say I tasted the other flavors listed on the menu: katsou dashi and preserved lemon salsa verde. I sampled the broth, and what I mostly tasted was salt, same with my dish. I had the ricotta-herb dumplings. These also came with a bunch of thinly sliced shitakes, and a good thing because I had only three dumplings of about an ounce each -- and I shared half of one with my wife. My dish was marked as a \"large plate,\" but only the serving plate could qualify as large.  This points up the main problem: portions were much too skimpy. I'm not looking for a plate that's piled high, but there should be enough food to satiate the appetite. My wife's fish portion looked like 3 to 4 ounces. If there had been a bread plate or a side of pasta, or even a few more dumplings in my dish, it would have been a satisfying meal. But there was none of that, nor enough vegetables to make up the difference. Even half an hour after we left the restaurant we were still hungry.   With a couple of cocktails, the price for two was about $72. Given the too small portions and lack of interesting flavors in most of the food, it is doubtful we'll go back especially at that price."}
{"text":"It had been a little while since last visit, and I was looking forward to Forequarter, but it did not make the grade this time. The wild mushroom dish was fantastic as always.  Great great great!  The cabbage wedge salad was a big miss.  Grilled lukewarm and tough cabbage with a one-note flat dressing and under-seasoned.  This salad could have really benefited from some seasoning and some kind of acid.  I contemplated asking the bartender for some lemon wedges and  salt/pepper to improve it.  That would have improved it, but I don't think it would have saved it.  The dumpling dish my wife ordered was described as a large plate. I guess if you call 3 dumplings that are approximately the size of a potsticker each a large plate then you will be fine with this.  The veg and sauce/broth with it were good.   But dumplings were not so special or laden with pricey ingredients (ricotta) that the portion should be so small.  The whitefish was good, not great.  We sat at the bar and the service was lacking.  For the first bartender that saw us, it was like we were invisible.  Lastly, and this is probably nitpicking, when I made the reservation with Resy I was asked if this was a special occasion.  I noted it was my wife's birthday, and though I wasn't looking for freebies it would be nice if they would acknowledge it.  They did not."}
{"text":"Forequarter. Quaint, cute, and quite exquisite.   I recommend the place for friends, coworkers, and dates. Not the best for \"parents visiting town.\"  It is very popular, and deservedly so. We had to wait an hour for a table but we got some appetizers and drinks and waited outside. Food was delicious - tasty but not too heavy. We had 3 appetizers, the scallop carpaccio, rabbit galantine, and the potato fingerlings. All were very fresh and delicious. I particularly liked the combination of citrus and raw scallops. The potato fingerlings weren't like the typical \"everything in America is fried\" ordeal. It was saute'd and not overly salty.  The main dishes were also great. We had the Charcuterie board, sablefish, and salmon dishes. The fish were very juicy and well prepared with a unique flavor to the sauces. The Charcuterie board was also very diverse, my favorite being the beef liver pate. We also got desert, definitely worth it.   The reason they get 4 and not 5 (though it was a tough choice), was that the server really didn't know what he was doing... We ordered a decent bottle of wine but he had to triple check which one we wanted. He had to double check quite a few times what we ordered and his explanations on the Charcuterie board was clearly wrong (he said something was goat cheese when it was clearly meat). But, he was friendly and was clearly trying his best, so we left a 20% tip and thanked him for his efforts.  Again, great place, highly recommended, but I hope they have better-trained servers to match the quality of their food."}
{"text":"Food was decent but not great. I think this place is totally overrated. Service was mediocre, have to remind them twice to get the drinks or additional bread (ridiculous portions: 3 mini slices for 4 people). The place itself does not match the quality of the food. Furniture is old, layout horrible and not to what has become standard in Madison. There is no double door neither a curtain at the front door. Today's was particularly cold (around 0 F) but every time someone goes in or out you freeze to death. Price is in the range of other places in Madison, but those other places (Heritage Tavern, Nostrano, 43 North,...) are better located, better decorated and with higher level of service and food. Too noisy (because of music too loud)."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, and yes the portions are small compared to American dishes. But as a foreigner I'm really satisfied with their changing menu and cocktails!"}
{"text":"Hard to get reservations. But one of the best restaurants in mad town, food and service vice. You're not going to regret picking forequarter for your dinner needs."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere are excellent. Try mushrooms from side dishes. Amazing! Ordered two portions."}
{"text":"Too hip for your own damn good! After a week in Napa sampling the amazing foods at Redd, Terra, Zuzu and Goose and the Gander I was rudely reminded of how full of themselves many of Madison's \"chefs\" and restaurants are...Ohhh no reservations- we're too cool for that...no you can't sit while you wait for the rest of your party...too cool for that! The charcuterie plate is the best part of the menu except for the fact there isn't enough bread or crostini...they charged $4 for more! That's 20% of the cost of the damn thing for Bread! Poached skate wing was cold and wet-not seasoned at all on a slushy chili infused pasty mash of something with raw red onions? WTF??? The chicken thigh and leg was raw...should have stuck with the apps- Brussel sprouts and beets on point- at least they bought my first drink- thimbleful of whiskey for $9 as a gesture of good will for the cold fish....to think we paid the same prices for top notch food at Chicarellos Bottega in Napa the night before reminds me why eating here is so unfulfilling!"}
{"text":"Another great spot for a cozy date night in Madison, we recently visited on a Saturday night.  We sat at the bar for dinner which at first I was disappointed about but the bartender was outstanding.  The drinks were eloquently hand-crafted and delish.  I had the Wiscosmopolitan and the Drankin' Patna, both were equally fabulous.    We started with a sausage and cheese platter which was Point Reyes Bleu (heck yes) and a local salami which was served with spiced nuts, bread, honey, mustard and pickles...it was the perfect fun sampling appetizer!  I had the fried & poached poussin chicken with red polenta, pickled radish & spicy honey ($20) and it was outstanding...not a ton of food but this place is definitely quality over quantity which worth it!  My husband had their ribeye roast special and is still raving about it.  We will definitely be back again for a great date night downtown!"}
{"text":"Wow!  I can't say enough about how incredible this menu is. I'm from California, and this food is just has fresh and bright as what I am used to from CA. I don't live here, but will be visiting again. I will definitely come back. Locals, come support this chef. So amazing!"}
{"text":"The food was unique and fresh, but overpriced. The service was relatively timely. The place tends to be very crammed. On a weekend night expect to wait a while for a table. While you are waiting there isn't any place to enjoy a drink or appetizer. Also, due to the construction, it is very difficult to find parking. Considering the plethora of other excellent restaurants in Madison, I will unlikely be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Forequarter is the retail, public face of the Underground Food Collective catering company. Distinctively Eastside. Low key, creative, knock-out food. This place popped up on my radar a while ago. Liz B. mentioned it the other day so the Spousal Unit and I invited a friend to go check it out. There's no sign on the building so those of you old folks that don't have smart phones should write down the address before you head out, other wise you'll walk up and down E. Johnson for a while before you find it ;-)  We three snagged the last table for four at about 6:10 on a Thursday night.  The cocktails seemed to be popular but we settled on a bottle of a nice, reasonably priced Sangiovese. When I asked about it she brought me a taste. To start we had: Ripped bread with eggplant and pork rillette and a beet (golden and red) salad. Main course was, for my companions, veal meatballs with green beans and eggplant in a light tomato sauce reduction and for me, roasted goat shank with garbanzos and cucumbers. Conversation slowed, Mmmms were said, happiness ensued. A raspberry buttermilk ice cream served with shortbread cookies dipped in chocolate ganache finished the meal. What a treat!  I've been in some fancier restaurants in Madison since moving here. They've tended to be a bit snooty and formal for my tastes.  Forequarter would fit nicely in my former hometown of Portland, OR.  Laid back, confident and creative. I will most certainly be back for more!"}
