{"text":"Absolutely amazing! I've come here off and on for about two years now. I work service so I'm all over the valley and if I'm in the area at lunch time I'm stopping! I have never had a bad meal there and I've tried pretty much everything. Dennis the owner has put a lot of work into the place and it shows. You can tell he takes a lot of pride in the place. Don't take my word for it so in sometime and try. You won't regret it! I can't sell it enough."}
{"text":"Food is, well bar food. Drinks are over priced, service is slow (at best). Halloween contest was a complete sham (done by someones perceived audience applause), best costume went to a guy with a store bought costume 'Condom man', compared to a phenomenal costume I saw some woman created, some alien like crazy creature (it literally looked she designs costumes for movie sets or could be on that 'Face Off' Show). I guess the moral of the story here is if you're not a \"Regular\" don't even bother entering their Halloween costume contest. Hilariously, I then saw a minimum of 15 different people come and console this poor woman to tell her she got robbed. I literally offered to pay her bar tab because she got that robbed. All and all this bar is around the corner from my house this was my third time in, and based on the food, drink prices and literal theft to that poor woman, I'll probably never go back. Cheers."}
{"text":"We used to go all the time, but the food sucked, it was a hole and the only good thing we used to say about it was it was a good place to take a sh....

Now they have let the only cool bartender go because he was a guy. Most of the girls were horrible and not all that to look at. 

Plus they promote the free shuttle, but normally the guy who was suppose to drive it was too drunk to be the driver.

Time to find a new home in Chandler."}
{"text":"We went to Jersey's on Saturday night to eat and have a couple of drinks. After 20 minutes and no server we went to bar ourselves to order a pitcher of beer.  We asked bartender for a server to order food and was told we would be helped soon.  After 45 minutes and still no service we asked to speak to the owner Dennis who we know.  We were told he was sleeping in back room  (8:13 pm) even though he was walking though the bar 10 minutes earlier and that he could not be interrupted.  Not sure if he got the request or not to speak with us, bur either way I will never be back!!!  Horrible experience."}
{"text":"Came in to watch the NCAA tournament. Has a lot of tvs, great food, decent prices. We chose the right place."}
{"text":"Came here on a few occasions on Tuesdays. They have a great happy hour Tuesday jumpoff... 

Music has a lot to be desired for, but it's a dive, no big. I mostly just come here because it's close by and I can watch the sports highlights on tv.... 

However, on this night, myself and my group were sitting at a table. We were the only minorities in the bar. We asked one server (who was white) for a drink. She stated she had to get someone else because she was going home. 40 minutes later, and she was still there helping the other \"white\" patrons. We were not rude or loud or obnoxious. Some people's intentions are obvious. 

The server who DID help us was quite nice. However, due to the treatment we got from the first server, we probably will not be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere; big screen TVs, beers on tap, pool & darts. By far the best nachos in town! 4/5 stars because the employees are a bit odd and one time a female bartender was rude to me. It's still a fun spot though!"}
{"text":"This is a great band!  The music is diverse,  easy to listen to and easy to dance to.
The musicians are professional, friendly and personable.  The singer has an amazing voice."}
{"text":"Being one of the \"ancient ones\" mentioned in several other reviews and a fairly regular day drinker, I find Jersey's to be exactly what it tries to be, a neighborhood \"dive\" bar with extremely diverse and interesting patrons. Great TVs, attractive and attentive staff, reasonable prices, and above average bar food. If you haven't been there lately give it a try, if you are looking for white table cloths and don't appreciate looking at and talking to sexy interesting bartenders and watresses, go somewhwere else."}
{"text":"Friday afternoon Happy Hour and the place was .. well it was not rockin'.  Here for a co-worker's farewell, but if it wasn't for the b-ball games on their large screen TVs... we were half the patronage.

Our waitress was very friendly actually and attentive, always checking up on us w/out being pushy.  Food is 2 star mediocore (it's a bar), but an extra star granted for the sober shuttle...  that's awesome."}
{"text":"Excelente food, excellent music band but poor quality in dinner time with waitresses service."}
{"text":"We had lunch on a Wednesday and were greeted as soon as we walked in the door.  Very good service, real good food and drink prices too.  My wife had a Rueben sandwich and the meat was real lean.  I had a Cuban pulled pork sandwich that was really tasty.  $2 domestics for Happy Hour and they have local craft beers from Four Peaks and SanTan on tap too."}
{"text":"Love this bar! I've been coming here for years - and I may just be a little biased about this place since I met my hubby here! 

The ownership has recently changed but the regulars and staff are still the same and super awesome. Great tasting food, wide variety on the menu and fantastic prices! I haven't had anything here that I didn't like. Happy Hour every day (think it's pretty much all day long on Saturday & Sunday).

Best thing about this place is they have LIVE MUSIC every weekend! They also always have their calendar up to date on their Facebook page so you can easily see who's playing that week. Love that they keep their fans informed. 

They also have a ton of TVs so pretty much every game you could want to watch is available. There's a pool table, dart board and jukebox available. Plus I've seen people playing Cornhole & Beer Pong on the weekends (beer pong later at night). It's family friendly, so at times there are kids their with their parents. 

Best little neighborhood sports bar in the area!!"}
{"text":"Yummy food.  Great staff.  They split a meal and brought it out on two plates for us.  So awesome of them."}
{"text":"I ordered Honey Wings so what did I get? Fried wings with honey poured all over them. Really not what honey wings are suppose to be. The servicers has improved. The bar has been remodeled and is now spacious."}
{"text":"Bunch of seniors hanging in this bar on a Saturday afternoon. Patio looked pretty uninviting (mostly for smoking) so i watched the game from a table near the bar. Clearly, there are plenty of TV's and somebody actually knows what games and what channel to put them on. Props for that news. Burgers, sandwiches and the usual suspects were popping up, but the weekly specials for Saturday were chicken enchiladas. It was the waitress' favorite dish (aren't they all), so I went for it and it turned out very good. The red cream sauce that was advertised might have been on there, but it was more like a cheese sauce mixture that was also mentioned in the description. It was bright though and kind of looked like a meteor when served. The only thing that elevated it was the excellent addition of green chilies to the shredded white meat chicken inside the three corn tortillas. The chilies added some zing to the dish and both the rice and beans were serviceable. Nice waitress and an all day happy hour made for a good lunch. I also noticed that nothing in this place is priced over $7.99 and the famous $4.99 burger deal is really about $6.25 if you add cheese. Good local bar."}
{"text":"Went to watch an early Football Game, 10:00 am on Sunday September 17th.  Three of us sat at the bar.  The server took our drink and breakfast order and didn't write it down because she assured us she could remember it.  It took and hour for the first person in our group to get their food and it was wrong, fifteen minutes later the second order was delivered and then asking several times about the third person's order (It was a short stack of pancakes) they blamed the kitchen and said it would be up soon but a lot of other orders were in front of ours.    Never going back."}
{"text":"I fully agree with Ted's review of Jersey's. I love a bar that offers fun things to do while having some drinks!  Between pool, Wii, and Cornhole (aka Bags) there's always fun to be had here. On Tuesday nights (after ~9:30) they provide free homemade tacos which are quite tasty. And kudos to the owner for providing a free shuttle to/from your home to prevent customers from drinking and driving!"}
{"text":"It's ALLLLright. A true dive bar I suppose. Eric the bartender was really cool. The crowd itself on a Saturday night, honestly, had me wondering if I was going to be followed home, murdered, and scattered about the dessert in body bags. Older 40's+ bar flies with bad staring problems. What...you've never seen 6 cute girls sitting at the bar before? Live band was cool. My favorite thing about it was the unlimited, self serve popcorn machine! I believe we got up to 5 rounds lol. FULL bar, great selection, but..not my crowd."}
{"text":"The sports bar ambience was good but that's about it. I had boneless wings and they tasted like some generic no name frozen things. They serve you on these cheap plastic plates that are faded and scratched. Also the service was not good.  Next time I'll just get Wing Stop and watch ESPN @ home."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night a couple months ago. It wasn't crowded but the service was lacking and the couple of rude loud drunks at the bar were too obnoxious for our taste. There are much better options in the area."}
{"text":"Under new management. Dennis has sold and we now have a new staff. Prices have remained including the very reasonable liquor and beer prices. New menu and items. Food is still good and well prices. They have cleaned up the area and have brought in more music. The crowds are starting to pick up and with some of the bands you need to arrive early if you want a seat. 

Time will tell if they can continue to improve."}
{"text":"I like Jersey's because it's got a \"Hole-in-the-wall-MEETS-modern-sports-bar vibe.\" It's spacious and has a pool table, if that's what you like. The food is decent.

The downside is their patio which is dark and narrow...just not very inviting. It's not that big of a deal for people who like to stay inside, obviously. And it's not even their fault. In fact, Teakwoods next door has a super small patio too.

Either way, It's a place I'll visit again, but nothing particularly redeeming. Heard they have great bands lately. If this is true, I'll edit this post and add a star or two."}
{"text":"This place continues to disappoint. I come only for the bands. The service is always horrendous. I sat here for 40 minuets and never got asked if I wanted something. I had to go up to them to ask for service. Then got attitude the entire time. I could probably walk out and no one would even notice. And I should because I've been sitting here for a half hour waiting for someone to take my money....still waiting. I would normally think it was a bad night for the server, but it's like this every time. I would rather eat next store where I know I'll get good friendly service and great food."}
{"text":"First time here at Jerseys. Tucked away in a strip mall next to a variety of shops. 
First impression---This is a bar for career alcoholics. I have a feeling these people are in the same exact spot every single day, seemed to me everyone knew each other, and the bartenders knew exactly what they drank and when to give them a new cocktail. I'm betting they all live within a couple of miles from here too.

Stage for bands, pool tables, smoking patio typical bar scene. No IPA's on draft had to settle for a Kilt Lifter, did not eat food but it looked like a typical bar menu, fried food, burgers, pizza. If my friends band wasn't playing here, I probably would of never stepped foot in this place. 

Jerseys........ehhh.......I've been in better, I've been in worse. This bar is a solid C on the grading scale. If there was a 1/2 star I would of given it 2 1/2.

Side note.....bar staff and waitress was very attentive and great.....5 stars for them."}
{"text":"First time here. Needed to work on a Sunday with free wifi. Staff was darling, wings were great, tv screens for football games are right-on. Coming back to this place again soon."}
{"text":"Lots of nice tv's. Beer was cheap during happy hour. Ordered a gyro and it was good. For the prices, I thought this place was great."}
{"text":"Great food, service, prices and atmosphere. They have live music every Friday and Saturday, you can call ahead to reserve a table."}
{"text":"Great music. Great food. Live music nights on Tuesday are the best. The food is excellence. Waiters are friendly. If your looking for a good night out you can't go wrong with this place. It's not a loud annoying place which is refreshing. Lots of tvs and sports also. Go for it!!"}
{"text":"Good local sports bar with decent music venues.  Great prices and damn good food for a bar.  Looks like I need to take some pictures next time, they don't have many."}
{"text":"I am truly impressed! I have been waiting for months and months to say that!!! I am so excited! I've been searching for a laid back local with good food, service and atmosphere.

Awesome food!!! Not just good 'bar food' but actual honest to God good food! The pizzas are awesome and the salads are actually good! 

Janelle was an amazing server! It's been forever since I've received such phenomenal service!

The most impressive part of the experience was the manager Danny he was super hands on and made sure his guests were taken care of and happy... Pics and more to come!!! Check it out!!!"}
{"text":"I dropped into Jersey's after a long hiatus because a band I like \"Uncorked\" was playing. I am happy to say that some major money was put into upgrading the insides, so I'll upgrade my rating. 

The only thing that they could improve on would be to put in a small wood floor for dancing. Cement is so retrograde!"}
{"text":"Funny in 2009 Alison someone said the waitress were bitchy and the food was blah.. one thing this place can say is they are consistent.  waitress was friendly (not real Bitchy but she wasn't real smart though and wasnt' a good waitress at all) till I realized she was flirting w/ the guy we were with the entire time and he had sent his food back twice for the waitress to say \"oh i took the first nacho's off\" well no shit they were horrible! LOL Beer was good. lol can't go wrong there. I'll probably try it again.. or not. i dont know."}
{"text":"Jersey's is cool. Plain and simple. Doesnt look like much from the outside but it has got some spirit. 

they have a lunch special or happy hour I think where they have a 3 dollar gyro.  For sho hard to beat.  Not the greatest food but who cares.  They are really friendly and when I went back the bartender remembered my drink even though it was kind of busy.  That is cool.

They also have fun stuff like Wii sports and bean bagging and karaoke.  Good place to meet people and hang out and do what you want.  

One other thing.... they have sports packages where I always get to watch my Red Sox.  A place should not be considered a sports bar if you cant watch the game you want when it is on. (Bar owners please that notice of that)

Good times."}
{"text":"I started going there 4 years ago they were great and have been in there lately the service was slow and food came out cold. I can understand on busy nights with a band but this was on a Friday with a mediocre band and about 20 people in the place ..... there are to many places in the  valley to put with this kind of service"}
{"text":"I used to love this place to be honest. Until today when the DRUNKEN owner came up to my husband and took away our chairs because he said they were in the way. He didnt discuss it with my husband in a respectful fashion. He took the chairs and spoke very rudely to my husband. All he had to do was be respectful to his PAYING customer and it would have been a different story. When I tried talking to him he was just as rude. Therefore this place gets LESS than 1 Star from us and We will never come back. We have never been treated so rudely in an establsihment before (for no reason) and Definately not by a DRUNKEN OWNER. SMDH. Unbelievable.

P.S. The 1 and only pool table is positioned in such a way that just about everyone is in the way."}
{"text":"I go here a lot since it is near a dear friend's house.

The food is not good, this is a place for drinking only. The waitresses are bitchy. The patrons are sketchy and 75% ancient.

But....on various nights they have Wii (bowling!), and karaoke, and occasionally a decent band. The management and bouncers are good people. They have a free sober shuttle if you live in the area. They have a popcorn machine that the bouncer refills all night long and it's self-serve and FREE.

All in all this is a good place to go with a friend or two to kick back and have a few drinks. Come here after you have eaten in any of the better places on the Ray/Kyrene-Priest-I10 area."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to play some buzztime trivia.  Expecting a dive bar and it sort of is but on the upper end thus it's called a tavern. It's a local hangout. Friendly group of folks.  Had an Italian beef sandwich which was delish,  homemade roll.  Good selection of beers,  and we're beer snobs."}
{"text":"Service goes a long way! Props to our bartender, Andy, for taking care of us and even storing the flowers that I bought for my wife in the walk in-fridge! Great atmosphere, great drink prices, great local bar! We'll continue to make this a regular stop. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Very good, reasonably priced bar food. Excellent live music. I will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by during a weeknight, late at night (near closing time). Seems like a good local sports bar that's reasonably priced. They have TVs everywhere so I'll definitely be checking it out again once football season starts. The bartender (who was nice) said they would show any team if asked."}
{"text":"Nice patio w couches and good TVs!!

Great HDTVs inside.  Friendly service, cheap drinks.

Happy Hour all night on Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"great pizza!  Dennis just bought a new wood fired pizza oven!  its awesome!  great prices on food and DRINKS how can you go wrong!  yum yum!"}
{"text":"Decent sports bar.  I tried the Philly sliders.  A chopped thin meat on buns.  It was good for bar food.  The menu has a range of items.  The table next to me had ribs.  It was Thursday and live music began around 7.  

Service was quick and attentive.  I would go back."}
{"text":"We came here to watch the local cardinal game, which was a Sunday night game...the only NFL game on. They still put a meaningless college basketball game on right in front of us on the main screen. Never coming back!"}
{"text":"Local Sports Bar with decent food, well priced drinks, HUGE inside televisions, COUCHES on the outside smoking Patio (with more TVs)...friendly people...speedy service...

Wow, it just occurred to me that Jersey's is a really great spot. I suppose something about the fact that it's a chill Sports Bar makes me hesitate in raving about it. But, I find no fault with them...hmm...

Let's keep going:

They have live music on the weekends, corn hole, that blue hand held trivia game thingy, a dance floor, high tops, low tops, booths...and some of the best bartenders in the damn state.

Alright, so, for what it is: A neighborhood sports bar - They're getting another star from me. I gotta give it up."}
{"text":"Super chill. Great place to hang out in the evenings. Good deals. Good beer. Good specials."}
