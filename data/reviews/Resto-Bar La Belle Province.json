{"text":"This restaurant was pretty clean, but it was a little hot in there. As for the food, I had a poutine and a cheeseburger, the poutine was good but the portion was a little big. The burger was the right size and tasted good. The wifi worked well, and the staff were nice.  Overall, very nice restraunt, good prices too!"}
{"text":"The staff at this place are incredibly cool. My brother and I went in to grab a bite after partying and we were kind of harassed by some random person and the staff entirely had our back. Once they realized we were uncomfortable, they went above and beyond to secure our comfort and safety. The food was rad, great casse croute, but the staff (front of house and kitchen) were super supportive and present. I have never, in my life, felt as safe at a late night diner as I did just now at this place. Honestly, the nicest two men I've ever met working a graveyard shift. Best dudes ever! It was madly appreciated."}
{"text":"Trop belle découverte ! Grâce à Nathalie! Accueil chaleureux les assiettes sont \"huge\". Quantité de fruits assez impressionnante! J'ai oublié de dire et bien c'est ouvert 24h/24 l'été. Alors le brunch est tip top!! #verdunluv"}
{"text":"Excellent steamed hotdogs all dressed and poutine.  The owner of this joint knows his customer service and was outstanding. Welcoming and friendly. I will absolutely be back to try something else on their menu. The breakfast offerings looked delicious which I noticed a write up from a local newspaper described the breakfast as the best in the City.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is one odd little neighborhood diner. I'm not generally a fan of la belle province. I find their food to be slightly below average your typical diner food, and their prices tend to be relatively expensive. Fortunately, it doesn't seem to be very standardized between La Belle Province restaurants.  I lived next to this little resto-bar for close to a year, and only recently (4 years later) came back for another meal and wrote this review. The restaurant has a small diner area up front, with 3 \"banquettes\" and a counter area with several bar stools. As you enter, you're faced with a large beer fridge and a wall covered with sheets of paper describing the various combo meals available. You order at the counter, pay, sit down and a waitress brings your food to you.   Late on a random Sunday evening, we ordered the 2 hot-dog + Poutine meal, which after taxes and tip ended up being close to $10. Not too bad. The hotdogs were streams and had mustard, relish and sauerkraut. Perfect. The poutine was decent. Some of the fries weren't fully cooked, and the cheese weren't super fresh. You could tell it had been put in the fridge, which takes the squeakiness and the oiliness away. The sauce was your typical poutine-mix gravy. Nothing special. There might have been even a little too much of it, and it ended up being quite the mess at the bottom of it.  The restaurant also doubles as a bar. You can have a beer for $3.25 (Dec 2009 visit) as you eat, or you can go in the tiny bar area at the bank and mingle with the bilingual crowd who watches football on a couple small TVs.  Not a bad place, not stellar either. If you're in the area and are looking for a quick bite/drink on a late Sunday night (when most is closed in Verdun), Resto-Bar La Belle Province in Verdun should do the trick."}
{"text":"Gotta say for a la belle pro they make it happen. I've been to many different ones of course who hasn't we live in Montréal they're everywhere but it's the best.  Hot dog and poutine is a deadly duo, most places either excel in the poutine and or the hot dog is mediocre or the other way around. Perfectly cooked hot dogs and crispy not soggy fries, with solid big chunks of curds and not a mucky gravy. A++  Best thing is that it even has seating outside and it's 24 hours. Now u you don't have to settle for McDonalds and stand in line or even wait in the drive thru. This place has been here for years and still haven't ever had to wait a long time or no seating.  Keep in mind this location even has beer, and lotto machines in the back. If the Hockey is on you will have it playing nice and loud in the restaurant.   This isn't a normal la belle this is the la belle ."}
{"text":"What a great little place. Visiting from Florida and wanted to try a steamy and some poutine for the first time.  It didn't disappoint. And what great service !"}
{"text":"This is NOT a part of the Quebec chain of \"La Belle Province\" fast-food restaurants - apparently it's not possible to trademark \"The Beautiful Province\" in Quebec, which means ANY restaurant can be called that. It's still a fast-food restaurant, but definitely a step up from the chain.  The burgers are tasty, and the poutine is really good - the gravy is not too runny, it's got lots of flavour, and the cheese curds are fresh. I haven't tried the chicken burger, but girlfriend wasn't a huge fan of it - so I'm sticking to the beef burgers.  I've also been for breakfast too (on the weekends), and it's a solid. Typical Quebec breakfast of eggs, fruit, (really good) home fries, beans, and toast (and cheap for the portions you get).   This is place is my go-to for hangover days, 'cause it's cheap and good. If you're in the area and need a fast feed, then I would recommend you go here."}
{"text":"L'hiver passé, quand mon chum est arrivé au pays, il a bien fallu qu'on fasse le tour de tous les classiques québécois et canadien. Bien sûr, La Belle Province était au menu, mais sans nous en rendre, on s'est rendu au Resto-Bar au lieu de LA Belle Province. Le menu a été quand même semblable, et puisqu'il ne s'agit pas de la franchise populaire, on y retrouve un petit bar avec quelques bières et des télés pour regarder le hockey. Si vous voulez en savoir plus sur LA Belle Province versus d'autres Belles Provinces, allez faire une petite recherche vite-vite sur Wikipedia et vous verrez que c'est une histoire un peu compliquée.  Donc, au menu, on est allé avec le plat fast-food le plus typique de la province: la poutine! On avait vraiment faim donc on s'est chacun pris un burger, le mien au poulet, le sien, un cheeseburger. La poutine était très bonne. Du vrai fromage en crotte qui fait \"squeak-squeak\", une bonne sauce au boeuf et des belles patates frites. Mon burger au poulet m'a moins impressionné. Un peu fade et il donnait l'impression de sortir du congélateur et il goûtait le carton. Le cheeseburger de mon chum par contre était tout le contraire. Délicieux!  Pour ce qui est de l'ambiance, j'ai trouvé ça déprimant de voir une rangée de gens à jouer aux machines à sous dans la section bar très sombre. Toutefois, quand un monsieur qui avait l'air d'un régulier de la place a vu que mon chum avait mis son chandail du Canadien en l'honneur de la partie qui jouait à la télé et qu'il s'est mis à lui crier \"Go Habs Go\" en dansant avec un gros sourire, je n'ai pas pu faire autrement que de sourire aussi parce que ça rendu l'expérience de notre tournée des fast-foods québécois encore plus \"vraie\". T'sé c'que j'veux dire?"}
