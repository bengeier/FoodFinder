{"text":"Salad is 'so-so', nothing special about their ingredients. It is WAY overpriced (now $7.49) for the stingy amount of non-lettuce mix-ins they give you. Okay in a pinch for a healthy meal, but otherwise save your money."}
{"text":"The family and I were downtown today and we needed lunch before we came back home. In tower City there are usually horrible choices if you're trying your best to eat healthy, or to at least Dodge eating greasy foods. We're walking through the food court and my wife shows me Mixed greens, she also tells me how they have healthier choices. Which is true. They have fresh paninis, smoothies and salads. All hand made.   They have a pretty big menu, but immediately the chicken melt Panini jumped out at me. The great thing about mixed greens is that the food is HAND MADE. I must stress that because they take their time making it. In the time it took my wife to order both of our sandwiches, I'd walked across the food court to the pizza shop, back and started feeding our sons before she sat down. The sandwich itself was great. Fresh spinach, freshly sauteed veggies with great juicy carved chicken ... I'm actually upset that this place is in tower City, and not closer to home. I'd compare them to Panera, but if Panera was just a kiosk and not a billion dollar corporation.  It's a must try if you're in tower City."}
{"text":"In a sea of grease pit restaurants in Tower City, Mixed Greens is a breath of fresh air.  I ordered a side salad and got to add 3 mix inns.  The real highlight?  The Mango Chardonnay salad dressing.  Delicious!  Reasonably priced.  Now if only I could enjoy my salad without inhaling the aromas of greasy french fries and overcooked chicken..."}
{"text":"I work downtown, so I visit Mixed Greens on a somewhat regular basis. I try not to eat out for lunch too often, but on my lazy mornings, I'll get a salad instead of packing a lunch. Other than Subway, this is one of the few healthy options. I do like the salads a lot, and the many options. However, they are CHEAP with portions. At $6.99 for the \"regular salad\" I don't think it's necessary to weigh the chicken on a scale before putting it on the salad. It didn't used to be like this. They used to scoop the toppings on, and use tongs to put the chicken on. Now, they actually weigh the chicken on a scale and they do NOT put enough on. I do think it is all very tasty though, just wish they weren't so CHEAP"}
{"text":"After being stranded at Tower City for an hour while i waited for the rapid to the airport i became famished!  I wanted a healthier option so i gave mixed greens a whirl. Got a chicken panini, with a side salad and a drink for $10. The sandwich was awesome BUT the side salad was a complete and utter joke. I literally got some chopped iceburg lettuce with three olives and 4 red peppers. I asked for more but the girl said \"only two toppings\" like what the hey!! Bland freaking salad, there was no substituting for soup or some other side. I was stuck. Okay so i got past that. There were FOUR girls working this particular afternoon, and could you believe it still took 2:10 seconds for ONE of them to acknowledge that someone was standing at their counter. They were talking about babies and baby daddys. Not professional at all. HELLO IM STARVING HERE  This place has some management issues, some pricing discrepancies, and is cheap with sides. If thats your thing then hey to each his own. but im good for now."}
{"text":"Kudos to Tower City for opening a healthy food option in Tower City.  The greens aren't the freshest and the toppings are pretty plain but it's a hell of a lot better than the grease pits surrounding it.  Also, a tip:  ask for your dressing on the side or any health benefits you could have reaped will be drenched in a ridiculous amount of dressing.  Seriously, they put so much dressing on my salad that I felt like I was having Italian dressing for lunch with a side of spinach."}
{"text":"Freshest salad I've ever had. I come for lunch almost every day. Highly recommend for a healthy lunch alternative."}
{"text":"This is pretty much your only healthy option in the entire Tower City food court. They serve salads, soups and wraps in a very basic format. You pick salad or wrap, your number of \"mix-ins\" (toppings) and protein. You then pick your mix-ins, Subway-style, although you are usually limited to 3 or 5, depending on what you ordered. You then top with cheese and protein.   There are usually a few soups and a few fresh bread selections. The breads are usually really good, if the Moroccan Olive is available I highly recommend it. Otherwise, it's about as basic as the grocery store salad bar but a good choice when you are looking for fresh, healthy options at TC."}
{"text":"I'm on lunch break from jury duty selection and was pretty worried about lunch, knowing it meant Tower City Food Court. After walking the perimeter and seeing the usual food court atrocities, I was happy to see Mixed Greens in the middle. I ordered the Alexandria sandwich, a mix of spinach, tomatoes, olives and some grilled peppers and onions. I'll give it a 5 star rating for being a pretty standout healthier option in a sea of fried fast food. Sure, I've had a better sandwich in my life, but I've never had a better sandwich in a food court."}
