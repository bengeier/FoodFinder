{"text":"After two very successful trips to Teakwoods it has become the official \"no need to dress up\" local bar!  The space is giant, with lots of tables, 6 seater high tops, and bar space.  They have an extensive menu that includes options that are NOT fried, which is a welcome alternative to traditional bar food.  I recommend trying one of the lavosh pizzas, the bruscetta variety was delicious without feeling too heavy! Though don't be alarmed they have all kinds of yummy indulgent stuff as well to soak up the liquor, er ,I mean diet coke :)!  But as far as liquor and beer go, there's plenty flowing, and they have my favorite, Blue Moon!  Definitely check this out!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service, great little unexpected gem."}
{"text":"We have been going here since we moved to Gilbert in 2004 and while they aren't as good as they were then, and they have lots more competition than they used to, Teaks still does pretty darn good.  We have even used them for catering a couple times and it was awesome!
They have some interesting items like the Alamo Chipotle Burger, Open the Hatch and Candlestick Carver as well as great wings and new food specials daily.  Prices are similar to all the others but more original food than the chains.
Don't forget the free peanuts whose shells are simply dumped on the floor.
Did I mention GREAT service and a lot of choices for your favorite beverage. Ans lots of TVs for your sports viewing pleasure.  
You get a big mix in the crowd from old time Gilbert cowboys, families, couples and sports teams."}
{"text":"This place is a big dive bar with not much to brag about. Gyro was made with a frozen patty heated on a grill. The mashed potatoes had no flavor at all and the veggies were cold. Service was ok but the girl that greeted us seemed inconvenienced. Wont be back."}
{"text":"My favorite \"sports bar\"! They have different specials and menus every night and my favorite is on Fridays...grilled fish tacos! The service is usually good, however depending on the server and how busy they are it can be a bit slow. We go there quite often and the wait staff that serve us freqently remember our usual drink orders...even the kids! The wings are great...try them \"grilled\"! I can honestly say that I have never ordered something I haven't liked. Burger wise try the Alamo Chipotle burger! Other favorites are the Gyro salad, Jack not Jill Chicken sandwich, and the Lavosh. I always get either the jalapano slaw or sweet potato fries as my side. I've only had breakfast there one time out of all the years of going here, but it was very good too. Yeah, it gets loud, but that's only because it gets crowded!"}
{"text":"Hi wanted to say great spot to eat food will never let you down always on point does not matter what you order onion rings to mouth watering would recommend anyone to just try there salads this food is one of the best in AZ"}
{"text":"I am from the East Coast and am used to dive bars being a certain way, but this one is truly unique in that there are peanut shells littering the floors.  As I sat there, eating the roasted peanuts, and waiting for my food to arrive, I felt uneasy dumping my shells onto the floor.  I said to my friend, OMG, littering is okay here and I do not know how I feel about this.  

So after my initial shock of dropped peanut shells and the first bite of my Sue-Ruben, and the country music performers on stage creating a nice atmosphere, I started to get into the groove of things.  Throwing your shells on the floor can actually be quite liberating! lol

I am a foodie and I must say that I was impressed with their take on the turkey ruben.  It was not as yummy as some of the places that make turkey rubens in NJ or NYC, but it truly did come in second for my taste buds.  

My friends wings were a little bland and the hot sauce that he ordered on the side was not that appealing.  Maybe I need to try more of their wings another time, since everyone seems to love them; but I am a stickler at times.

The service was amazing and they had great drink specials, although I did not partake because I had been drinking earlier at RnR in Scottsdale and my stomach needed a rest.

Go here for: A great country-like setting, great sandwiches, good service, and nice drink specials.  I will be back."}
{"text":"We go here fairly often because our girlfriends like the place but I'm not too big of a fan. Almost every food item is $9 or more and they very rarely have any food specials. They do have some good specials on beers on done specific nights though. They also have free peanuts that you can toss on the floor. If you want a liquid diet its a good place."}
{"text":"Always great service and great food! Never had anything I didn't like! They always have groupons, living social deals, and specials, which helps too! Love this place."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorites. The wings are absolutely perfect every single time. Drinks affordable and reasonable. Fairly good crowd even during the week. The bar itself goes through ups and downs in terms of appearance and peanut shells but all in all its a good functional establishment featuring a seated booth section for families outside of the bar area- for which it gets five stars."}
{"text":"Typical bar setting, service was pretty good but the food wasnt good at all. We ordered burger sliders and the ultimate grill cheese. If I do go there again it will only be for drinks."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The most unpleasant, nasty servers who make you feel like a burden for asking for anything. We received our food without any utensils to eat with. We had a women serve our food (she looked like she was the owner) and she was so rude and abrupt. They are lucky they have good food, otherwise they would be out of business."}
{"text":"When you see the word \"Tavern\" in the name of a place, your first thought probably isn't \"Hey, I bet this place is kid-friendly!\" But in this instance, you'd be wrong, my friend. It's loud, crowded, and the floor is covered in peanut shells (mommy translation = your kid can throw a fit complete with screaming and throwing food on the floor, and nobody would even notice!)  They don't show a kids' menu online, but they do have one that has your normal selection of kid fare, as well as a handful of crayons and pictures to color. The adult menu has a nice selection of pub fare: appetizers, soup, salad, burgers, sandwiches, etc.  Interestingly, they also have a breakfast menu. I'm a big fan of hot wings and let me tell you, the suicide wings are no joke. The menu warns to \"order at your own risk\" and you'd be wise to heed the advice. And of course, being a tavern, they have a full bar. Great drink prices!"}
{"text":"As a recommendation from a friend, I went to Teakwoods to try their famous wings that I have heard so much about. We got the honey BBQ and hot wings and they were delicious!! Juicy, lots of meat on the bone and cooked to perfection. Our server was outstanding, our drinks were always filled without us even asking. We also got the nachos and the club sandwich, also outstanding! This place did not disappoint, will be going again! May even become my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"GREAT wings (if you like them wet ask for extra sauce on the side - they don't understand the term \"wet\" here), yummy steak fries and the cheesy pretzels are to die for! I also love that my draft beer (Blue Moon specifically) is always served perfectly cold and priced right!!

The atmosphere is super laid back, and the crowd is about as diverse in age and appearance as you can imagine - not an easy thing to find at a local bar and grill in AZ. 

Bonus: they keep the family/arcade room separate from the \"adult\" bar area."}
{"text":"Fantastic Food!!! If your looking for something off the menu... Get the El Jefe Wings with a side of limes.  The best wings ever.. No need for ranch or blue cheese.  
Staff is always nice.   Great tv watching and plenty of locals and regulars to chat up."}
{"text":"We were at Teakwood late yesterday 2/3/17.  We order 1 dozen grilled wings. we had them there, taste was good on almost 9 of them.  3 tasted burnt.  We thought ok lets order 2 dozen to eat on Sunday for the Super Bowl.  Got home dumped them in a bowl to store until Sunday.
Half of them looked burnt.  So I did like this place now not so sure."}
{"text":"Good place to drink. Can't say the same about the food, though. Feeling hungry I asked our server if the veggie burger had dairy or eggs in it. So, he exhales and rolls his eyes like I just asked him to help me move or something. He comes back a few minutes later and says, \"The veggie burger might have dairy and eggs in it.\" Well, if I wasn't concerned about it I wouldn't have asked. He tells me \"You should just eat it\". Like I'm going to eat something that nobody knows whats in it? I emailed Teakwoods, too and spoke with a woman who said she'd let me know about the contents of the veggie burger. After a week or so and no response I sent another email. No response. 

+1 cheap drinks
+1 for peanuts
-2 for half-assed and rude service."}
{"text":"Not one of our best nights here. We went late so not many people inside but our food was cold and they didn't tell us when we ordered that they were out of items that come on the food we ordered. If I would of known I would of ordered something different"}
{"text":"Very, very awesome bartender and the fillet men-ion sliders are to die for."}
{"text":"I'm giving teakwoods a four based on other sports bars. I have always been happy with the food here. Though yesturdays sandwich toped everything I have tried there. I ate the pretzle philly cheese steak. It was a philly sandwich on a pretzle bun. Awesome! If you want good food, good prices, and sports. It is a good place to go. Oh yeah dont forget free peanuts..."}
{"text":"Teakwoods is one of our favorite casual places to go. The Friday fried fish special is very good.  The fish tacos are great too. Awesome wings.  Free peanuts."}
{"text":"They have the best wings in town!! We recommend honey medium, extra crispy. They moved happy hour down to 600pm instead of 7 else I would have given them a 5/5. Monday's are half priced bottles of wine!"}
{"text":"I really like Teakwoods.. they are a perfect place to go to watch the game. I love their wings.. and my husband really likes their burgers. Teakwoods has a nice atmosphere for a sport bar. Their service is always great the waiter/waitresses are always very attentive. The only thing that is a negative is they are a little expensive as compared to other sports bars.. my husband and I had over a $35 tab after a burger and wings (no alcohol) but all in all very good"}
{"text":"Burger was not as juicy as other places. It just felt dry. It filled me up but I think that was because the bun was so big. 

Good news is that you get an options on fries! Either big fries, skinny fries, or tots. 

The place has alot of TV so it's perfect for sports events. I was watching the Boston Marathon bombers being caught so I will never forget it :-)"}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here often. We love their wings and nachos! I look forward to trying their breakfast.   There's a waiter named Polly that's pretty good at remembering our names and is excellent at his job.  The only complaint that I have is that they don't ever show any fights here but there are many other places that do. I can come here for the food and cold beers."}
{"text":"Just returned from a Sunday afternoon of bloody mary's, wings, fries, and football. The holy trinity. Oops, I guess I'm a little over three things needed for a trinity. Oh well. Needless to say I wasn't rooting for Tebow! 

The wings here are amazing. We ordered them medium honey BBQ and they could have been a touch hotter for my taste, but I wasn't complaining. The crispiness of the skin was perfect. We ordered a dozen but filled up with 5 wounded soldiers still on the plate. These wings weren't skimpy, y'all. 

The service was awesome and the TVs were perfectly spaced out for prime viewing. 

Now if you'll excuse me I need a nap. 

Did I mention the Bloody Mary bar? With blue cheese stuffed olives? No, well you might see me there next Sunday."}
{"text":"This is Teakwood's newest location here in the valley and they are really great! The service is wonderful, the wait staff friendly and the food is really good for pub fare. It is definitely not a health food restaurant, but if you want great pub food and a good beer while watching a sporting event of your choice, then this is definitely the place to go!"}
{"text":"Another great Groupon find.  

Teakwoods is kind of tough to describe - it is like 3/4 sports bar and 1/4 lounge.  On one side they have big, burly tables with lots of TVs up on the wall, showing every available example of athletic competition.  And golf, too.  On the other side, they have pub-style tables and an area for local music to come in and play.

The place - even though it borders on Snotsdale - was unpretentious and populated with an eclectic crowd of folks.  I saw cowboy boots, jauntily-cocked bowler hats, and a tatted up chick stuffing sugar packets in her purse.

I was charmed.

The boyo and I have been back several times since.  The wings, as noted by others, are really good.  In our case, we go for boneless as neither the boy nor I particularly enjoy sucking hot sauce from under our nails.  The wings are always tender, and have great flavor.

Service is usually pretty good - sometimes a little slow, but... whatevs.  Throwing peanut shells all over the place is enough to keep me entertaining while I wait for my beer.  (To the person who complained about the dusty, dirty nuts in the buckets... don't suck on the shells.  Duh!  The nuts are well sealed inside their safe, dirt-proof casings and are totally tasty when you crack 'em open.  With your hands.)

I wouldn't recommend Teakwoods for folks who aren't into meat.  Not a lot of variety for someone who doesn't want beef or bacon on some form of bread.  But the Chicken Philly is muy yummy (I eat it every time we go there).  The boyo has worked his way through a number of interesting varietys of ground cow with toppings, and has enjoyed them all (except the sliders - he found them dry).

Ultimately, we would definitely (and have already) go back.  I think we've been 3 times so far - twice with groupons (and we have another one to use), and once at full price.  Always a nice, relaxing night out."}
{"text":"I am from Wisconsin and present this review as an out of towner. I came for the wings and they were average at best, Along with the beer list which was definitely average.  The bartender seemed to be having a bad night so the service was average at best. I am sure that there are plenty of good things on the menu and plenty of fun to be had at this local watering hole, however this is not a must go to spot for anyone visiting the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place since I was a little kid and the wings have always been the best. Any flavor you get will be great, but the all time best is the Honey BBQ. Cannot beat them anywhere!
The rest of the menu is also pretty wonderful and always a good portion size. The burgers are always juicy, the cheese curds will never do you wrong, and the fries in any style are great.
They also have a really good selection of beer, and who wouldn't like that?
The atmosphere is quintessential sports bar. The Tv's are always running the sport of the season. There are peanut shells on the floor(even to this day I love crushing them underfoot) and it's loud. But its the \"Everyone having a good time and enjoying themselves\" loud.
Also every employee I have ever encountered at Teakwoods has been super friendly and attentive.
If you've never been I definitely suggest that you give them a try, because I know you'll fall in love."}
{"text":"We have been meaning to try this place for a while, but always get sucked into Mido next door. So today we went to go to Mido and they weren't open yet so decoded to try Teakwoods. It wasn't over crowded and we pretty much got a whole area to ourselves. My husband and I ordered boneless wings in 2 flavors. They were ok, but several pizza delivery places can beat them. My father in law got a bowl of chili and said it was terrible.  Our fried zucchini was so over fried it was almost black. Luckily the waiter agreed to take them off our bill. Unluckily he only came to check on us once after we got our food, probably 20 mins into eating. I had to venture to the bar for extra average settings and my hubs 2nd beer. I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because if we had a better waiter I think that would have helped."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, food's always pretty good at a decent price.  Service, too, is pretty good.  HOWEVER, if you have a passport card (thru Apple, Channel 8, etc...) they don't honor them anymore.  So beware you will be paying full freight.  Kinda disappointing."}
{"text":"Great place! It's the beer I come for. They have an excellent peach beer that is perfect. Not too sweet or to starch. Perfect blend. Along with there pretzel and cheese appetizers I recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm a wing addict and have particular tastes in what I like in a wing.  These are now officially my favorite wings in Phoenix (there are some better in NY, but alas I live here now and have to work with what I've got).  I ordered 1 dozen of the hot.  First off, glad to see blue cheese as an option, always a good sign.  Celery and carrots, check.  Good assortment of wings to drums, awesome.  The wings were also a good size with a nice amount of meat on 'em, but not too big.  Best part, the heat was perfect.  Stuck with me for sure, but a good bit of heat while still having great peppery flavor.  Very traditional flavor.  They were nice and crispy, but not overly fried so as to loose some juiciness.  Finally, there was a good bit of sauce on them.  I hate it when there's practically no sauce and I have to ask for an extra side of sauce.  These were coated and just the right amount of sloppy.  Pair that with a good $2 beer and I was a happy girl."}
{"text":"A buddy of mine had gone there recently and I was very impressed with service. Our server was very friendly and made sure that we were taken care of quickly when we needed a drink. The wings are the best I've had here in the valley. I also had the philly cheese steak, which I wasn't impressed with but the wings made up for it."}
{"text":"Wanting a change from the Half Moon for some Sunday Night Football, i sought out another sports bar in the 85016...  Teakwoods was the answer.  Lots of TVs.  Average service.  Extensive Menu.  Good drink specials.

The Good:  For bar food, nice menu... the Jess Jess wings were pretty good.
The Bad:  The beer list is dreadful.
The Ugly:  God only knows whose nasty fingers have been in those buckets of peanuts.    

The crowd was the best part of this place... it was absolutely eclectic.  

5 drunken frat boys
4 suburban gangsta's
3 hipsters with the raybans 
2 goth chicks on a date
1 TwentySomething daughter arguing with her cougar mom about how many martini's she'd had (\"mom, i swear thats your 4th one, why would i lie, i drove separate?!\")  
...And a partridge in a pear tree... Teakwoods has it all!

{"text":"Loved this location, but it has inexplicably closed.  It was always hoppin' when I went.  Too bad ;("}
{"text":"I gave this place 2 tries and both times it was a complete FAIL! 

1ST time: 

I ordered the Gyro and it was awful! The meat tasted like it was just taken out of the freezer and nuked in the microwave. The Pita bread was stale and when I attempted to fold it and take a bite it broke and everything fell out (goody gum drops).  

I understand that a Gyro is not a common dish that every restaurant can prepare with perfection, but don't put it on your menu if you can't make it. It's like an auto repair shop that also does manicures, just don't do it! 

2nd time: 

I decided to give this place another chance and the end result was I me being out 20 bucks and extremely disappointed yet again. I ordered a simple chicken sandwich and it tasted like cardboard. I was certain that they could not mess up a chicken sandwich and they did. The bread was stale (AGAIN), the chicken breast was small, over fried and nearly tasteless. The fries were nothing to brag about either."}
{"text":"If our daughter hadn't asked to go to the Moose place we wouldn't have gone back. We went this Sunday and our regular waitress (who rocks!)  noted that she hadn't seen us in a while. We told her the story about the table drama and she said she'd talk to the manager. At the end of our meal the manager came over and apologized. She remembered us and felt badly that we'd left. We felt understood and now will feel free to go again. The long-term wait staff here is really good and I hope their manager appreciates them."}
{"text":"Ate here the other night for the first time. Place is a lot of fun. Plenty of tv's with sports on. Had wings which were real good also had sausage and peppers which was excellent. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday evening to use a groupon.  For the record, my husband is addicted to groupon.  I am not.  Seems many restaurants who use this discount are not restaurants I would ever go to otherwise.  Dining out is a treat for me so I prefer going to places I know are my taste.  We were two of only about six people there at 7:00pm.  That told me alot.  I ordered the loaded burger and my husband the turkey reuben.  Both sandwiches were good.  El heffe wings were not that great.  Server was fine and food came out so fast we barely had enough time to enjoy the peanuts that everyone seems to rave about.  Atmosphere is what gives 
this place my low rating.  Huge place, no people and prices are high if you do not have a discount. Sorry Teakwoods, we won't return."}
{"text":"Our waiter was \"Horrible !\"We never did get his name. I had to wait for a Tap Beer, the food came out at a reasonable time. This is because the kitchen staff brings it out. Our server was quick to give us our bill, but never asked if we would like anything else!? I told him I would actually like to order dessert. This, he was responsibly to bring out. I ordered the cookie with ice cream. They warm the cookie up and put a scoop of ice cream over it. Well, we waited 12-15 minutes. Flagged down our waiter and told him we had not yet gotten it? He turned around and said it was up. We wanted another 12 minutes. Finally we got up and said we would just like the bill, forget the dessert. Now the excuses came . . . the dough has to rise, it takes a long time to bake. . . the dough has to rise? We won't be going back!"}
{"text":"My go to place. Great staff and good food, they never disappoint. Burgers and wings are two of my favorites! This is a great place for a late night drink; they usually slow down after 9 and you can hang without having to deal with a crowd on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"We have been ordering chicken wings from Teakwoods since we moved to Gilbert a year ago.  The wings are meaty, well cooked and flavorful.  We have never had a bad experience.  Closer to home than Buffalo Wild Wings and better wings too!"}
{"text":"The free peanuts are a plus. 

The food is very good most of the time."}
{"text":"Late lunch, early dinner. Good reviews on wings, cheese curds and mozz sticks. So that is what we ordered. My husband also oredered the gyro salad. We came inside to say were sitting outside, server followed us with menus and silverware. I ordered a cosmopolitan, my hubby a beer. Drinks came but no water, guess you have to ask. We did. Server was quick and friendly, so are we and I think that always helps. Food was awesome cheese curds made miss my home in Wisconsin. Mozz sticks like at saz's at summerfest, yum. Chicken wings with teriyaki delicous. My husband's gyro salad was huge and delicious as well. Cosmopolitan really good so I had 2. Will be back. Not crowded at that time, good timing for a new place. They also have all you want peanuts, don't really care for the mess they leave."}
{"text":"Great local place (as are the other locations in the Valley).  Good happy hour and daily specials.  This one (on Indian School) has particularly good service and usually a decent crowd.  Good for lunch, happy hour, dinner, weekends, just about any time."}
{"text":"Drinks were not as good as previous 20 visits. Specials have changed and aren't as good. The Bloody Mary was no longer unique, simply Major Peter's mix, which has too much horseradish for me. If I am to make a return trip, I will need some serious convincing from someone."}
{"text":"Soooooo sad this one has closed. Great staff awesome food! Loved to watch the UFC fights there. Really bummed it closed"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere for a combo restaurant and bar. Their burgers are my favorite but lots of choices to pick from. Free peanuts! Crowded on the weekends."}
{"text":"I've been going here for awhile and always love this place! The staff is friendly and the wings are top notch. Its a great place to meet up with some buddies and watch the game/ grab a beer or you can take the whole family here too. Don't think I've talked to any friends who haven't like Teakwoods. 

-Bottom Line: It's worth checking out if you haven't been there yet!"}
{"text":"I don't tend to go out of my way to come here, really why would anyone. If I happen to be in the area I stop in for a drink and maybe some food but let's get it clear, THIS IS NOT A DESTINATION PLACE. I'd rather go up to SanTan, it's a bit further but a lot more quality places to go to. The noise level is a bit too much especially on a weekend day when it's family time. Service is always good but when you're the only ones at the bar, shouldn't it be? Not too much to ask."}
{"text":"I have been to Teakwoods many times.  I always get the wings because they are delicious and meaty and I really wish I had some right now.  They have to be the best in Chandler.

The atmosphere of the bar is a little different, as they seem to be going for a Texas Road House-style peanut eating place.  The peanuts are in huge buckets at the table, and you are encouraged to eat them and smash the shells on the floor.  I like peanuts and I love smashing things, and let's face it...being drunk is a blast, so when you combined all three and then add in some delicious chicken wings and hot servers, how can someone not recommend?"}
{"text":"Teakwoods is what this 'hood has been needing for a while! The vine - OK, Mckennas - horrible! Teakwoods is the knight in shinning armor!

Great tasty food (not just bar food either!). Service is excellent - never had to wave Jessica down once - even brought a round over when we were ready to order another - great intuition! Great atmosphere and lots of TVs! Who cares if they have 4 old school TVs - You cannot miss all the other 15+ flat panels with sports to watch while drinking a great pour of a decent selection of beers. 

Second time to this location and tried the Honey Hot Wings, Turkey green chili sliders and the onion rings. Friends had green chili burger and boneless wings  - All cooked to excellence! 

Specials are good! Today there was $1.50 domestic drafts after 5pm... I don't know about Heather M - but this makes me a happy camper! 

The crowd is mostly people from the neighborhood and other no nonsense fun lovers that like goodness! Manager noticed we were having a good time and came over to check on us and gave us all $5 off the next visit coupons! C'mon - who does this! I am a loyal fan from now on!"}
{"text":"first time here and i wasnt all that impressed. lets just say i was afraid to ask my waitress when she was due.. but thats beside that point. bunch of tvs tho i had to squint to see whats going on. my eyes arent that great but whatever.

it was a wednesday so they had margaritas and mexi beers on daily special, which varies. had 3 margaritas fairly fast. felt nearly nothing. weak as hell. i expected to half stumble out of the place but really i was fine.

decent selection of wing flavors. which i might start seeing as a bad sign. tried the El Heffe wings. dry and dusty but a decent taste, with no real kick like it says, except maybe in the stomach itself. and the extra dollar for them? shouldve been a dollar less.

cant screw up peanuts. the peanut shells on the floor novelty was probably the best part of the place, because you cant be that messy anywhere else but a baseball game. thats an extra star in itself. 

the rest of the menu looked good so i may be back on a day with better drink specials and try something new to eat. ill update this shit if i do so......"}
{"text":"Been here many times, and always enjoy the burgers.  Casual atmosphere, sports on TVs and friendly service."}
{"text":"I got the Jack Not Jill sandwich.  Maybe it was my fault for changing the hamburger bun out to wheat toast but, this sandwich was very lackluster.  The fries were soggy and not crisp at all.  I won't be rushing back and, if I did go back I would definitely order something different."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried out Teakwoods for the first time on Friday night with the Groupon I purchased a couple months ago.  I was so excited to find out that they have Four Peaks Peach beer and it was on special!  Double bonus!  I had the chicken fajitas which were really good and so much food.  There was no way I was going to finish it all.  My boyfriend had the buffalo chicken sandwich which he loved.  We will definitely be coming back to Teakwoods.  The service was awesome too!"}
{"text":"BEST WINGS IN ARIZONA!

I can't believe that with the two reviews before me haven't mentioned their wings.  They beat Buffalo Wild Wings by a long shot.  Now I have to admit I haven't had many items on their menu, mainly just wings, burgers, and fries but everything I have tasted was amazing.  Although that could be because I have had a few beers in me.  

TW also has a good beer selection on tap, although my wife has complained on their mixed drink selection.  

Overall, if you want to eat great wings, get drunk, and play some Golden Tee, nothing beats TeakWoods."}
{"text":"This sports bar has a great local neighborhood sports bar feel. There's seating in or outdoors. I've never been unhappy w/anything I have ordered. In fact, I'm usually pleasantly surprised. And I think their hot wings are great! The best in the area. This place is noisy, but hey it's a sports bar. Would you expect anything less? Check it out and enjoy."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!  What's better than peanuts shells all over the floor and cheap pitchers of booze...!?   The play offs and these amazing wings.  This spot is fun and lively and the food is awesome.   Come for some food and stay for the fun."}
{"text":"Beer was super cold, food was awesome, and the service was freaking great at all levels. Did I mention the beer was super cold? Great place. I will be going back."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Teakwoods is my favorite place for cheap beer and good wings.  El hefe wings are the best!"}
{"text":"The burger was good and the service was good to. You get free peanuts! This place can be noisy during a big game with several big screens on. If you like sports bars this should de fine."}
{"text":"Friendly sports bar with good prices on bar food.  The menu is par with other bars in the area.  Alot of teenagers and kids running around, but it doesn't really bother me.  Though I don't live in the immediate area, it seems like a popular local place.  No reason to come back because there are similar concepts closer to home, but a sold bar and grill overall."}
{"text":"Good food as always. Ordered a hop knot  tasted like short hop. Asked waitress to double check. Bartender was positive it was hop knot. Whatever."}
{"text":"5 STARS only because I have been going there since before it was Teakwoods.  Even then the wings were awesome. Very dissappointed!!! This place was kid friendly with just enough games in the tiny game room. We have fight night there kids included!! This is the second Groupon I purchased to use on the 21st. Gilbert and Chandler to far to drive. BUMMER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We came here a week ago and we were seated immediately. However we didn't get a server to come talk to us for 5 minutes which is a long time in the restaurant world. Then when the server came she didn't even say hi or her name or anything just what Can I get you guys to drink? Then after she took the whole order she took our Groupon. 10 minutes later she came back and attempted to tell us we never gave her the groupon. How do you lose your table's groupon?? She eventually found it in between menus. Although she wasn't a good server she was nice. However the food was cery delicious but I wanted wings and said they have a supercharge which makes absolutely no sense?? Poor customer service but awesome kitchen."}
{"text":"The place is nice with a kids area. The food is average and takes a long time to come. It is mostly a bar. The peanuts are fun but it can get noisy"}
{"text":"Our server was siera and she took wonderful care of us . Our food came out piping hot as soon as it was done cooking . Our order was perfect and the atmosphere was very friendly . The only downside was that there was no host at the front to take us to a table so it took several minutes to be seated. Overall, the food was wonderful, service was excellent and the atmosphere was upbeat and fun. We will be returning again .  :)"}
{"text":"We enjoy our visits to this neighborhood joint! Staff is always friendly and have never had a bad experience! Juicy burgers, zesty salads, creative flat breads, and cool atmosphere. Until next time friends!"}
{"text":"Tuesday nights, my sweetie and I have a standing date at Teaks. We sit at the bar because Julie's there. She knows what we like and has it sitting in front of us before our bottoms get settled on the bar stools. Teaks is a comfortable place that reminds me of the Cheers bar from TV fame. My husband and I feel like family there and usually end up there at least twice a week. The food is consistently good, especially the Southern Thang burger and the Ultimate BLT sandwich."}
{"text":"A daily specials menu that much more expensive restaurants would be proud to feature along with a comfortable \"peanut shells on the floor\" setting combine to make this a wonderful place to eat, meet friends for drinks or catch one of the dozens of games on their extensive tv collection. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Awesome wings. Great beer selection. I love this place."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for almost a year and I have yet to dislike anything! The servers and bartenders are on top of it, the last time I went our sever bused everything perfectly as well as keeping up with her obvious amount of work. As a table full of current and former customers from the industry, no one complained. Thanks for the great food and service!"}
{"text":"I love Teakwoods!! The wings are awesome and I will not eat any others.  It is a great place to pop in and have a quick beer after work or on the weekend, or really anytime."}
{"text":"Been coming to Teakwoods  for years.  Used to live .5 miles to there Chandler  location on Ray Rd.  Loved there wings, salads, and grilled cheese.  Just moved and now live 4 miles from there Gilbert location.  So, I decided to give it a try.  I was with a group of people, they ordered El Hefe style wings, and I ordered a Cobb salad.   Both were just as good as the other location, and service was very good."}
{"text":"We went for the happy hour and the many who said the wings were fantastic. Not much of a happy hour menu, really just a couple of items which was surprising, but the wings made up for it. We had the el hefe wings which were amazing (we also had the chicken tacos which were yummy). We aren't locals and had I known how good the wings are, would of just ordered more of them. I would be promoting those and making happy hour all about them!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to have a drink on my way home from work, bar tender was friendly...Can't really attest to anything else. Didn't order food but will try next time"}
{"text":"Had a living social deal, it was about to expire, and I wanted to use it. Unfortunately, it didn't apply for take out. The girl who answered rudely informed me. I checked the coupon and nowhere did it say \"dine in only\" or \"not for take out\". I called back and spoke with Ryan, the manager, who was nice enough to let us use the coupon anyway. The fun doesn't end there! I drove down there with my wife and daughter, and my wife ran in to grab the food. As she grabbed the food, not 10 feet from her, talking to another server, the rude girl from earlier said (try and imagine this in your best snotty little 20 something bratty voice) \"ugh, I TOLD that guy it didn't apply to take out, I don't know WHY he talked to management about it.\" And rolled her eyes. All of this in front of my polite, sweet wife who did nothing wrong. I have been here multiple times with my parents, who are regulars at this bar. The food is great, but after this, I will NEVER return here. And you probably shouldn't go here either if you want to use a groupon or a living social or anything like that. Because they treat you like YOU'RE an asshole. 

Short version? Don't use a coupon because if you do, they'll treat you like crap."}
{"text":"Good solid sports grill with a varied menu.  Make sure you try the cheese curds"}
{"text":"I like this Teakwoods!

The beer flows cheaply, the staff are really friendly and many of the customers in there smile as new folks walk in the door too.  It's not often you find a place like this that has an overall happy vibe.

Pros:
- The portions are BIG
- The staff are great
- They sometimes do groupons
- They support the local community through things like participating in the Indian School Street fair
- They give you peanuts to shell and trash the floor with which somehow appeals to the inner kid in me.
- The beer is cheap

Con's
- none that I've found"}
{"text":"I just moved out to the Chandler/Gilbert area and I am glad to have Teakwoods close by. I love the feel inside the bar and the drinks are good. The food is really hit and miss.

I would give this place 3 stars, however they do have trivia nights which have been really fun so it bumped up the place to 4 stars. 

I do recommend this place for drinks and trivia, not really the food. I will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"We love it here. Great food, great specials, and great service. :) Our favorite local casual bar."}
{"text":"If you like wings, this is a great spot. Good choice of sauce and I love the fact that you can get the wings grilled after frying and covered in sauce again. A must have. 

The burgers are good as well. Have not tried the other items. Beware the free peanuts, you can end up eating a ton of them."}
{"text":"Qver-priced, substandard food.  Never met a cheeseburger I didn't like-- until now, (NOT a 1/2 lb.).   Small portions of tired, room temperature \"fry-pieces\",  burnt bacon, chicken tenders so hard, they couldn't be penetrated with a fork.  Mediocre service;  didn't bring kids meal cookie.  Waste of $$$!"}
{"text":"Our server Paige was great!! The food came out nice and quick and taste spectacular! and as always I have to get my kilt lifter beer to go with my hot wings of course! my wife loves the garden burger opposed to the turkey sliders she always gets... Unfortunately they were out of prickly pear for the margaritas so my wife had to get a Jamaican 10 speed instead which was great in all except it cost $2 extra... Maybe next time... But all in all it is a great place great environment"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a sports bar Teakwoods at Indian School is NOT the place!  I had high hopes for Teakwoods but was really dissapointed. Most of the TVs are from 1990!  There are a few flat screens but they are so small you can't really watch a game.  The food was OK but not great.  Limited beer on tap.  I think this place is best for families that want to take their kids out to dinner.  Very casual and you can throw peanut shells on the floor.  The style and atmoshere where really boring including the bar area. Service wasn't shabby."}
{"text":"Been to Teakwood many times, but today was awesome.....I had my 3 grandchildren with me, and we always split 2 breakfasts....When the food got to the table, Kelly had the plates divided for us!!!...so, i didn't spend 5 min separating all the items!!!...wow......my breakfast was still warm!!!!...anyway, she also shared some of her artwork with my girls, that they can color!!.....I've always had a good experience her, but this was wow!!"}
{"text":"Sad to see one of our favorite places go downhill. The Wings, which used to be the main draw for me, are smaller and dry. Making matters worse, there is a $3 wing \"up-charge\" due to \"increase in market price.\" Seriously? Dining area is dirty. Service was great but didn't make up for the overall bad experience.  People working there are great but the product just isn't worth it. Not sure what happened. Too bad."}
{"text":"After hearing so many great things about this place whenever discussion about the best wings in Phoenix came up I decided to check this place out last night with my son. He ordered boneless and I went with traditional along with cheese curds and their fire fries to share. Overall we were both very impressed with the food, I liked that the wings are finished on the grill.

Service was very friendly and timely, and the bucket of peanuts on the table was a nice touch. It looks like they have NFL Sunday ticket as well if that's what you're looking for. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend on the recommendation of friends in the area. I think we must not be on the same page about what a good restaurant is because this place was essentially a TGI Fridays. Very \"kid friendly\" which translates to a pathetic tap list and weak drinks. I ordered a margarita that I didn't want to finish, both because of the lack of alcohol and the unpleasant, bitter sour mix they used. The menu was way too big and the \"creative\" items fell flat. My boyfriend's burger was fine, but I ended up pulling my reuben apart and eating pieces separately because the simultaneously soggy and crunchy marbled rye couldn't withstand being held up. If you're looking for a safe dinner with options for a group who want 5+ cuisine types, this is it. If you were hoping for a cool tavern with good food and great beer, keep looking."}
{"text":"First, you have to know that this place is CASUAL. Wear your flip flops, hat on backward, and your ASU t-shirt, and you'll be fine. Lots of TVs, pretty busy on game nights, and there's a patio.

The best part? Kids were sat on the restaurant side. Woohoo!

As for the food, just embrace the whole peanuts on the floor thing. Really. It was hard for me to chuck them on the floor, too, but it's not really a reason to dock a star... The food and service will take care of that for you, because it's as casual as the atmosphere. 

The service was just a bit slow and sloppy. Hubby was given the wrong sandwich,so I shared half of my turkey ruben with him. It was a fine sandwich--not great, but not bad. Hence the 3 stars! His cheesesteak came back out looked really yummy but the cheese sauce just didn't have any flavor. My Blue Moons were excellent. :)

So if you want a fun, casual night out, just don't go with high expectations and I think you'll be just fine!"}
{"text":"Great to grab a bite and a drink every now and then. Food is classic Americana. And the salads are great as well!"}
{"text":"This is a bar that has more than just the typical bar food.  Daily specials mean new dishes that include sandwiches, burgers, salads, steaks, and seafood. They have efficient service, busboys who clean tables promptly, and allow you to throw your peanut shells on the floor! But with food that is thoughtfully prepared, it is a waste to fill up on unlimited peanuts. Oh, did I mention they have happy hour and drink specials every day ?...."}
{"text":"Always love this place would eat and drink here any day of the week and twice on Sunday's. Pretzels are the business"}
{"text":"This place is not hard to find at all when we got here it did take a while to get seated as we were kind of lost standing in front but other than that the service was great, fast with our food and overall very nice. The food was great! I would definitely eat here again, I got the Mediterranean quesadilla, it was delicious and it was a very good serving size. The cups were nice and large too which was nice definitely got hydrated eating here."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and price of the lunch specials. Wait staff was super friendly. Ambiance was perfect mix of brew pup and casual eatery."}
{"text":"live music. peanuts on the floor. ntn trivia. arcade. cheap bar food. FANTASTIC drink specials! (what more could you ask for in a bar you can walk to from your house?)"}
{"text":"If the rating were based only on the food, I would give 5 stars for sure. I've been here several times and try something different on each visit. The food is always amazing. My mom said they are her favorite wings of all restaurants. The atmosphere is great on the main floor, but when I was seated to the other area once, the acoustics were horrendous. It was so loud in there I could barely have a conversation with the people right next to me."}
{"text":"The food is pretty bland, service was fine. They should certainly try spicing up their recipes a bit with.... um flavor lol."}
{"text":"We love this place! Who doesn't like buckets of roasted peanuts at each table you can munch on and throw the shells on the floor! Great menu options and good prices! Lots of big screens to watch sports too!"}
{"text":"Peanuts were STALE AS HELL!!! Asked for fresh peanuts and got peanuts more stake. Beer was very COLD so that's a plus. Place has a nice feel but the greeter was cold and had no smile. Bar maid was smiley and nice. She had a nice smile and was attentive to us. I am a fan of cold beer and if not from peanut stale I would have rated higher. Burger was seasoned nice but overbooked as I requested med to med well, came cooked well done but was still ok. Fries were cooked to order and pretty good. I think overall it is just good, not excellent. If care was taken and effort made, could be pretty great place. Employees sitting and talking could be an opportunity to better food and service. The place was not busy so there is no excite for sub par food and surely no excuse for rudeness by staff. Just be happy and welcoming and concentrate on perfect food and there will be more fun."}
{"text":"We like going here for the atmosphere, beer and tvs. The kids can be loud and and relaxed. The service is good and friendly. The food is just ok. The wings are anemic and the rest is adequately prepared. Not great but not awful. We frequent it."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, great service, family friendly. 

Love the wings, the cheese curds, the lavosh, the edamame."}
{"text":"Came here on the recommendation of a few friends.  I was looking for some good wings and was told this was the place to go.

Menu--tons of options.  The menu has something that everyone can enjoy.  Also plenty of kids meal choices.  My daughter got the grilled cheese and ate the entire sandwich...gained points there!

Food--started with the cheese curds.  Very good!  Midwestern style reminiscent of curds I have grazed on in the north woods of WI. Then I opted for wings.  Got a dozen and split half Jess Jess and half El Hefe.  Cool that they fry them and then throw them on the grill but mine were dry.  Perhaps I was expecting more due to the hype that led us here.  Homemade blue cheese dressing is really good. Wife got the buffalo chicken tacos but removed blue cheese and wing sauce....soooo,  can't really comment on those.

Service--waitress was nice but when she got refills she grabbed glasses from other tables at the same time to refill theirs at the same time.  This freaked me out because I was certain I would be drinking someone else's drink upon return.  

Atmosphere--cool bar setting with a log cabin feel.  

All considered, an average place to grab a bite.  May be better suited for apps and beer to watch the game rather than a sit down meal."}
{"text":"We come here almost every week after work. We always have the same server and she always takes care of us! The food is better than average bar food. We always get wings and cheese curds which come with a yummy jalapeño ranch. My favorite part of teaks is the consistency. They don't do crazy things with their menus or drinks. Simple, great bar."}
{"text":"First time here, bad experience. Don't order the Cheese Sticks. They are in large egg roll wrappers with no melted cheese. Not good. Only ate 1, waitress didn't ask if we didn't like them, it was clear we didn't. My wife ordered a BLT and with white bread, came out with wheat, had to wait for the waitress to come back a few minutes later, she took it back to the kitchen, finally brought it back out when the rest of our group was basically done with their meal. Plus the BLT had a super greasy deep fried tomato on it, they should remove that from the menu. The kids pizza was gross and dripping with grease. Just a overall bad experience and with no attention to detail or making sure your customers were satisfied, especially when the bill was almost $60 for lunch. Never again! Stay away from this place. #GreasySpoon"}
{"text":"YUM!  I had the best ham and cheese sandwich here for lunch with this totally awesome jalapeno cole slaw.  I can't wait to go back to try the rest of the menu which looked a LOT better than most sports bars' menus.  Service was excellent too."}
{"text":"Great wings, I will be back for more! Also, they have a great happy hour and the staff was so responsive on getting us our drinks and food."}
{"text":"Best food in chandler, great service too. I can order anything off the menu and love it1"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Wish there was one in nw valley"}
{"text":"Nestled into a strip mall this gem has the bestest lavosh since my beloved Pischke's in Old Town Scottsdale closed it's doors. Teakwoods always has Frour Peaks Brews which we love, love, love. We've had the burgers - really good, fries - good, salads- really good but the lavosh keeps us coming back. Next to try is the boat load of nachos. Can't wait for that calorie implosion.
Tip - they have Groupon offers sometimes so keep an eye open for that."}
{"text":"My Friend and I was looking for a late night grub... Went on Yelp and found this place. Didn't know this place exist  as we walk in peanut all over the floor... I was like ... What !!!  this place is so kool !!! Ok I love the wings ... Catus and el hefe wings are amazing .... Edamame a little to salty. My friend had \"The Duke\" he said it taste pretty good. Our waiter was amazing good service. Over all everything is good !!!  I will be back again"}
{"text":"Every other time I have been to this restaurant it's been enjoyable however the other day outweighed them all. 

We entered with a party of 8 and we're immediately told by who I believe was the manager that there was not a table large enough. We told her the high top would work and as we began walking she rolled her eyes and let it a loud grunt. She then began talking badly about us nearly three feet away. She continued to let out her frustration with us loudly and mentioned it every time she walked by. We also heard her loudly talking badly about a different table because they had taken the order down wrong. 

We will never be returning and have told some if the used to be regulars at our company what happened."}
{"text":"Mitch was the best server I've ever had! We don't live in the area but will definitely be back when we visit again. Amazing service and great food!"}
{"text":"Ahh...I should learn. Sundays at the bar means being run out by the regulars and politely ignored by the bar staff in favor of said regulars. Food is consistently good, just need to stick to the tables."}
{"text":"Typical american food. Burgers, sandwiches, and wings. 

Love the all you can eat peanut and how we can throw the shell on the floor. 

Place feels super cramped though and it seems its hard for them to accommodate large groups."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with Teakwoods.  I love their wings and pretty much hate everything else. Upon walking in your greeted by a mass amounts of peanut shells on the floor (personal pet peeve but I'll get over it since it's becoming really popular in restaurants nowadays). The restaurant seems disjointed you enter from the bar side and if you're looking for a more relax feel you walk through an empty door frame to the other side which doesn't seem to match the Bar side of the restaurant. The service is normally friendly but very spotty sometimes I can get a refill, other times it's hard as reading the Grapes of Wrath. By know you're asking why do I even bother? The wings here are just that Damn good! I've had most of the flavors but my favorites are the Jeffe and original hot. The wings are always hot, crispy and saucy (well the ones that are supposed to be)! The salads are nothing to write about but nicely pair with the wings to help cut the fat. The last time I went I had the Zucchini chips and they were hot and crispy yet void of any real flavor, I had to immediately dunked them in  ranch for any satisfaction. Bottom line is as long as this place can satisfy my wing cravings I'll remain a loyal customer. PS- On some weekend nights they have live music."}
{"text":"Teakwoods was amazing. We went with a group of 6 and we're accommodated perfectly. The food was delicious, I had the Pita with gyro meat and string fries, and our server was very attentive. Great value!"}
{"text":"I was told about this place several months ago and every time I was in Phoenix, I just plain forgot....that was until about a week ago.  As usual, my girlfriend and I were looking for a place to eat and could not decide where to go.  We were both getting grumpy and hungry when I remembered, finally, Teakwoods!  A friend of mine had told me about their wings and how good they were.  I told him I like HOT and he said that I would love this place for their suicide wings.  When we walked in I first noticed the peanut shells all over the floor and the buckets of peanuts on the tables, \"Cool I can make a mess and not get yelled at!\"  We sat down and the waitress came right over to us with menus and took our drink orders.  She was the only waitress there for the first half of our visit and she didn't miss a beat even though there were about five other tables, unfortunately I can't remember her name, but it was a very unusual name.  My girlfriend and I both order the suicide wings and we were not at all disappointed.  The flavor was great!  They were extremely hot, but not enough to kill the chicken flavor and they didn't have that vinegary \"sauce-out-of-the-bottle\" taste that many wings have.  I will be honest, it was our first visit, but not our last!  Also, don't forget to scan the tag and get 15% off your food bill!"}
{"text":"Went out with 8 people for dinner. The service was fast and friendly. They had very interesting choices. Great wings! Good burgers that hit the spot. I had the cheese burger lavosh. It was like a cheeseburger on a cracker. Couldn't finish it, but it didn't make you feel too full. We're definitely going back!"}
{"text":"went here for lunch with my boyfriend. we came on a friday so they had specials going on. its a really big place. they have peanuts on the table which is awesome and bad cause they are addicting! lol. we both got beer. i ordered a blue moon and like it should, came with and orange slice! my boyfriend got a hamburger and i got tacos. they were really good! i would definitely go back to this place!"}
{"text":"I have lived down the street for a couple of years, but a good friend from college just moved to town so we needed a place to grab a beer.  Enter the Teakwoods. Since they won 2012 Best Wings ( If you are into that) and it fits the bill nicely. The wait staff are all really friendly from the hostesses to the bus people.  It's a pretty typical neighborhood bar although they do have a separate section of the restaurant for families to hang out so you have less of the \"Sweet Home Alabama\" looks.  It's a very comfy place with lots of TV's and always a people around.

The wings according to all my friends are very good.  Since I am a vegetarian I highly recommend the ultimate grilled cheese sans bacon.  It's not the healthiest thing you could ever have, but it goes great with a Snake-Bite.  I also appreciate that any of their burgers can be ordered with a veggie patty so you can switch up from the grilled cheese every once in awhile. The food is really good and way above what you would expect from you standard bar food.

This is a great bar if you want a friendly atmosphere and good food.

Try:
* Onion Rings
* Ultimate Grilled Cheese w/ Snake-Bite
* Pretzel Appetizer
* $2.99 Jager shots"}
{"text":"The best service hands down, this is how a bar/ grill should operate, motivated servers and the food is good too. Wish I had one closer to the house."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome!!! Food is fantastic and service matches! Our second time here and will for sure be back many more times. Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"I just left Teakwoods in Gilbert wishing I went somewhere else. I happened to stop by there to eat for the first time. The service was VERY slow . They left us unattended for quite a while.  Our drinks finally arrived after waiting a long time. When the food finally came out, the sides were ice cold. The management there was less than interested in fixing any problems we had. The server told me 3x the manager would come speak to us anr never showed up. The food was horrible, the service was the pits and management was far from effective.  Save you time money and appetite and find a different place to eat."}
{"text":"Sports bar atmosphere, peanut shells everywhere. 
Typical sports bar food and it's just average. 
Service is not very good. Our server was training someone so you'd think she would maybe go over the menu offer suggestions, even tell us her name...no. She was extremely slow as well. 
Don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"This is a place where they have peanuts at the tables and there is just peanuts shells on the ground. Just FYI to help understand the ambience. 

Food was really good I must say. We have the El Jefe wings boneless. When it came, we were disappointed because it looked like a dry rub but man but it pack in some flavor. I would def. recommend that if this is your first time here."}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing but over the past two years they have slipped.  They used to have excellent service but this has slipped the most.  They seemed to have replaced older, more seasoned staff with younger less experienced. I do still go an had a waiter the other day that was excellent so perhaps I just got unlucky a few times.  The biggest slip is that the place is not kept very well.  It seems like they have given up trying to keep the dining room clean.  It gets worse and worse and it looks like everything is grimy.  

The wings and food are usually good here.  The wings can be great if you ask them to cook them crispy.  The hot are hotter than most so be careful.  Great happy hour prices and beer specials.  Be sure to get the fish tacos if they have them.  

If you have loud kids this is a great place.  It is VERY loud and nobody will hear them.  They  also can throw their peanuts on the floor so that will keep them busy for a while.  Great family place."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I made this place our stop to eat and enjoy some drinks for our reunion celebrating 14 years for friendship, abd a friends Birthday. There were about 10 of us. Two of those 10 were not drinking as to have a DD. The server was obviously busy as there were many other customers; we didn't mind that however her attitude was something to be desired. She did not even smile once, or introduce herself. The food came out in a timely manner. Flavor wise it was rather boring, nothing to rave about. We had wings, regular and curly fries, and corn dogs. The drinks started out great for our first round. However the second round many of us noticed the gummy bear shots were only half full as opposed to the first order. They were tasty; we did not bring it up. It began to slow down, and many of the other patrons had left. This was when we saw less and les of our server. We ordered one more round before leaving. The server gave us attitude about who was driving. She obviously did not pay attention when serving out table or taking orders as the pregnant woman was even looked down upon by this nasty server. Once we received or beverages We then sang happy birthday to our friend, this was frowned upon, the server disciplined us for being loud. This in turn caused the table to discuss perhaps leaving a lower tip. We debated this together at the table. In the end we decided we would be fair and leave a large tip as our bill was substantial. When we were leaving this server confronted my friend about our table tipping her (mind you she had not checked her tip yet, but had been eavesdropping) the friend she harassed about this happened to be a server herself, and informed the woman she was lucky to get what she was receiving and if she continued to be rude we would go back and remove the tip completely. This one server ruined my experience here. It's sad when clearly management does not their servers or who's working for them."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. Good food. Restaurant is a little rundown and needs a renovation but not a deal breaker for me."}
{"text":"Decent place to get drinks. Do a little homework on the drink specials. football is better now that it is not a gaytriots (patriots) bar.  You will have an awesome time as long as you go when there is a special on your poison. i like fridays... 2.50 kiltlifters."}
{"text":"Disliked this place.  My burger was overdone and the bartender never checked on me so I couldn't ask for another one.  I partially choked down the charred thing and called it a day.  Bartender finally stops back by after me and my date have been staring at them for quite some time.  I take this opportunity to complain about the burger I had hardly touched.  The response?   \"Oh I'm sorry.  The cooks usually don't mess things up.\"   Okay??  Remaking my food the way I asked for it would have nice.  The beer wasn't cheap and the food wasn't good.  Won't be back"}
{"text":"If you get a tall bistro table at Teakwoods and a pail of tossable peanuts, you feel like a baby in a high chair: you can throw food on the floor and the people in charge think you are acting your age.

For a game day, Teakwoods provides quick beers, limitless peanuts, and some of the best tater tots in town.  (Order mild or hot wing sauce on the side.)

The veggie burger is passable: better than your jerk-friend's paltry meatcentric backyard bbq garden patty but several racks below Houston's inventive saucy offering.

Teakwoods is about nuts, tots, and suds. Let's face it."}
{"text":"Decent sports grill.  There is always a crowd so you know the place must be popular with the locals.  The place does tend to get a bit loud as it starts to fill up.  Be prepared to talk over everyone else.

I have been here a handful of times.  The food is good... with the exception of my most recent time (1/4/2013) I went.  You can't go wrong with the wings.  As a wing connoisseur, these are pretty good.  Also, based on reading others reviews here on Yelp, you definitely can't go wrong with the Pretzel Sticks as an appetizer.  You get 7 sticks with a side of cheese sauce.  It could be a meal in and of itself.  

I also did have the bacon double cheeseburger lavosh  my past visit on 1/4/2013.  Although it did not taste that bad going down, there was something with it that did not agree with my innards.  Let's just say that the leftovers I did have immediately went into the trash.  I'm hoping that this was just one dish and not a trend of things to come.

No bashing on Teakwoods though.  I will go back on occasion and try other things on the menu.  I am hoping the one bad dish does not outweigh the other good ones that I have had.  And as a tip, if you go for the fish & chips, make sure you get there early.  The last time I went and tried to order it at 7pm on a Friday night, there were none left."}
{"text":"I'm giving Teakwoods a solid 4 stars. They have great special drink prices, and an excellent selection of standard barfare, but with additional, unexpected treats as well. I once had fried pickles as a special... The nachos are great, quite a thing to tackle on your own, and when I asked for no meat, the waiter suggested the vegetarian beans as an add on. Most places wouldn't have even taken that tiny step above to recommend that vegetarian option! The wait staff isn't always the most attentive... there have been times we would have had one more round of beers at the table if we hadn't had to wait so long for the waiter to check in. But at least there are peanuts on the table to munch on, and how fun is it to be out at a restaurant, as a grown up, and throw your discarded shells on the ground!!!"}
{"text":"1st visit today. Groupon deal. Saw none of the negatives on other yelp reviews. Waitress was Kayla. One of the best. Polite and professional. Food was outstanding and abundant. Was impressed enough that bought groupon same day."}
{"text":"Great place to go out with the guys after a night of what ever.  The food is good.  The ice tea is good.  Nothing bad to say about this place.  I have tried their burgers, French dip and cheese steak.  They were all pretty good. There chicken wings are good too.  I am not a fan of chicken wings in general, but these are good for me. They have complementary peanuts on the tables too. Like it and recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I've never been to a restaurant that has hidden charges! Ordered a dozen wings for $11.49 and was charged a $3 surcharge and $2 because I asked for the wings to be saucy because sometimes they are dry. I asked the waiter why the extra $5 charge and he said there's a $3 surcharge for ordering a dozen wings and $2 for the sauce. I'm never going back!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love teakwoods! They have cheese curds and pitchers of beer, so it's a win win. Loss of star for the burgers. Every time I ask for well and there is always pink in the center. I'm not sure if it's the waitress not telling the cook, or the cook, but I always feel bad either not eating it or sending it back.
Overall we will keep going back. Big menu, friendly staff and peanuts!!"}
{"text":"I preface by saying that I patronize the Ray Rd, Chandler location frequently and would give THAT location at least 4 1/2 stars.
However, the Williams Field location is sub-par for sure. Starting with the disgustingly dirty front doors, to sticky, food-stained menus it's just not good.
Although I did notice some happy waitstaff, our server was not happy to be there (or maybe anywhere) and made it known by her lousy attitude.
The bright spot to me was the kitchen help - they turned out some very good food and did it fast. As they have an 'open' kitchen you can see the goings-on and these guys ROCK!

Teakwoods-Gilbert: Get your place cleaned up (and keep it that way) and motivate or replace some wait-staff and you will catch the Ray Rd. location."}
{"text":"I have been a patron of the Ray Rd. location for many years. I have had good, even great waiters and yes, some really bad ones too. Seems no one stays long.
I have always enjoyed the food.. it's not Ruth's Chris, but it is always fresh and the daily specials are most-always spot-on.

 What really intrigues me is that they seem to be hanging on to their age-old beer selection,... carrying just the drivel put forth by Bud/Miller/Coors... Four Peaks is now owned by Bud. Blue Moon has been owned by Coors since its inception. I sure wish Teakies would wake up and smell the coffee as far as having REAL craft beers on tap. Please guys/gals!

Was surprised to have the place be near-empty for Thursday Night Football night last week. Maybe it;'s time to join the craft beer wave."}
{"text":"Despite any bad or lower rated reviews, of which there are a few, this place was bustling with business last night.  

Occasionally (like all the time), I'm a tad opinionated on where I'd like to be seated.  Never by the restroom, preferably a booth, and not crammed next to another group if there are more comfortable open spaces available.  This has more to do with my personal preferences and less to do with this review but I just felt I'd throw it out there.  

I asked to be seated up on the raised level just north of the bar when the waitress began to lead us to a table on the floor level.  It was no big deal, she accommodated us easily.

Happy Hour up until 7pm, I believe.  $2 domestic drafts.  My wife got a Blue Moon for $2.50 and I had iced tea.  We also had an order of a dozen hot wings and fried cheese curds. 

This place is definitely a bar serving bar food.  Every plate that I saw delivered to a customer looked pretty tasty and piled high with food.  I saw some super looking Nachos, a huge burger with a pile of fries, somebody even had what looked like a burger patty with a side of cottage cheese and fruit.  Even that looked good.

Our server wasn't the most attentive but he got our drinks out pretty fast and when our food hit the table (brought out by a different server) he was there to refill my iced tea and to bring my wife another beer.  You can't really ask for much more in a bar.

The wings were great.  We didn't order suicide but instead opted for hot and they were okay.  Not super hot but not super mild.  The cheese curds were new to both of us and they were okay.  Sort of just like breaded, fried chewier cheese but none the less tasty.

In the end we paid $22 bucks for two beers, two apps and an iced tea.  Not bad.  

Oh yeah, you're supposed to just throw the peanut shells on the floor after eating them.  This felt weird for some reason even considering that the floor was covered with peanut shells."}
{"text":"The \"service\" here is a joke and the atmosphere obnoxiously loud inside. Unless you don't want to actually talk to the people you're with, best to stick to the patio. After taking our order, our server Angie disappeared until the very end when she had the nerve to ask if we wanted boxes. Um, no thanks, we'll take the check. Lots of people working and walking by and not one stopped to see how we were doing - even with a table full of dishes that we were clearly done with. Teakwoods often has a Groupon, but this place is not worth it. If you're starving, the food is okay, but that's if you can find anyone willing to help you. Good luck."}
{"text":"I love this place! The cheese curds and soft pretzels are amazing:) the wings are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Like what everyone else says, EJ JEFE wings are the BEST!! Personally, I believe these are the best wings I've had in my life so far. They're truly unique and delicious. I don't live in Phoenix but whenever I pass by or stop in town, I make sure that I stop at Teakwoods for the Jefe wings AND their soft pretzel bites. The SOFTEST buttery and savory pretzel bites ever. 

Not only are those two of my favorite foods to get there, but the waiters and waitresses we've had are extremely nice! They were on top of refilling our glasses, asking us if we needed anything, and got whatever we needed without hesitation. I love places like this with great food and great staff."}
{"text":"Yay for tater tots!

I love that Teakwoods is in my hood. I work at the coolest advertising agency (www.lavidge.com) on 28th and Camelback and we love coming here for lunch because the menu offers something for everyone.

Teakwoods offers come-back coupons, LunchClub coupons and always service with a smile.

I'm glad that old nasty McKenna's is gone and some real food moved in. Thumbs up for your great service and awesome Gallagher-look-alike."}
{"text":"Take anything you want from me,
Anything.
Fly on little wing.

Came here the other night to try their wings. Got here before my friend did and sat in the crowded dining section in the east wing of the restaurant. Noticed the peanut shells on the floor - sorta creating the same effect as sawdust on the floor at Bill Johnson's Big Apple restaurants. My friend was bragging that this place had the hottest wings he never tried. Wuss. One of his friends tried the hottest wings on sale here and started sweating and crying and could not finish them. Over time and many beers I've heard that same legend over and over stretch to include emergency vehicles, demonic possession, terrorists/US military wanting the recipe so it could be weaponized, fire-breathing and whatnot until I finally said - ok we're going there - I need to know for myself. I ordered the suicide wings - traditional. No waivers had to be signed, nobody standing around with fingers on 911 speed dial button. Seemed like a standard thing to order at this place. Ok. Cool. When the wings came, they looked like any other \"hot\" wings. Tabasco colored little wings just sitting there waiting for me. Grabbed the first one and took a bite. Tasted vinegary hot sauce - good stuff. But the burn kept up as if all my teeth suddenly grew little wicks and turned into lit candles. Whoa - a CONSTANT burn even after the wing is done. Took the next wing and same thing. Ended up instinctively grabbing my beer to put out the fire. Wow. Perhaps the story had some merit - Teakwood's suicide wings aren't wussy at all like a lot of other places that claim to have super hot wings. When I finally got through all the wings, my friend noticed that I consumed four beers in the time it took him to drink one. Most times we go to a bar it is the exact opposite situation. Our waitress was even nice enough to bring me a tall glass of ice water as well. I'll have to admit, I have recently been on a quest for the hottest wings and most places have failed to impress - haven't finished the quest but I'm putting a flag down here for now as the hottest I've had so far. Was a bit concerned I'd find out the true meaning of \"fire in the hole\" the next day but fortunately that wasn't the case. Funny thing we got here at peak dinner time and when we left just around 11pm the place was a ghost town. If I didn't see another table of customers in a far corner I would have thought they were closed. They're open till midnight most days except for weekends when they close a little later. Plenty of parking in the mall it shares with Walgreens and Thailicious."}
{"text":"Here is the deal, we have been loyal customers for many years but have discontinued our weekly visits for the last several months. This was due to the handout you are given when seated with your menus. The handout states that they are concerned first and foremost in the quality of their wings and that there is a wing shortage causing them to charge a 3 dollar surcharge on their wings. Normal price for wings at their restaurant is $11.59  for a dozen wings. Add a dollar for a specialty sauce you're up to close to $13 then add the three dollar surcharge and you are up to a grand total of $16 dollars for a dozen wings. NOPE. This is ridiculous,  other local restaurants not raising their prices or charging a surcharge only Teakwoods. We returned last night after many months to see if they had reversed their surcharge. Nope still there. You know what isn't there? All of the people that used to fill up the restaurant. You've lost a lot of business trying to make extra money. There are plenty of places near you to get great wings and watch the game. Check out Zipps or the Vine."}
{"text":"I agree with some of the other reviews that claim that these are the best wings in town. This location is pretty big, has tons of TVs to watch the game on, and a great menu to satisfy whatever bar food craving you may have. This isn't one of those hoity-toity gourmet gastropubs. Teakwoods is a nitty gritty, full-on sports bar with cheap beer and amazing fried goodies. We've spent many a night here (kitchen is open later than most places) with their El Hefe style hot wings which are coated in cilantro and garlic. SO GOOD. I usually get the suicide sauce on the side because I am cowardly. Only downside is that sometimes the service is AWFUL. Tons of free parking, free live music, and ohhhhh bumped this to 4 stars because they've got a Ms. Pac Man machine!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend asked me to be his girlfriend here over two years ago. Automatic 5 stars...

No, but really, Teakwoods (both this and the Phoenix location) has the BEST wings in Phoenix. For a sports bar, it's pretty neat. Tons of space, great food, drink specials, and tons of peanuts (which you can just toss on the ground as you please). Their hot wings are very hot-- I like to go for the El Hefe style wings finished on the grill (with the suicide sauce on the side). Mmmm mmm."}
{"text":"Well after being a frequent flyer in the younger days to the N Scottsdale Teakwoods, I had to check this one out. I think I heard my liver scream when we walked in due to prior Teakwoods days! 
This location is strip mall located, though doesn't feel like it when you are inside. It's roomy, has a positive vibe, and I still enjoy tossing peanut shells around! 
We went during happy hour and the the hubby enjoyed some 2.50 pints. I had wine, per usual, but it was only 5.50 a glass not on special, so hey, that's okay.
The food is a little pricey, which is why I knocked a star off. 7.50 for pretzel strips and very watered down cheese seems a few bucks too much, and 8.50 for basic meat free nachos seems steep too. It was all good, but I was starving, so who knows. 
Mainly post work business crowd. Some games scattered about, a medium sized screened in patio out front, large TV's, and clean restrooms. 
Our bartender, Sarah was awesome. She was attentive, obviously great at her job, cute, and never seemed behind or flustered. Our food came out accurate and fast.
Thanks Teakwoods for being close and giving me some much needed Friday booze! Happy hour appetizer specials would have upped my rating. Advice: the portions are large, so share one. We had a ton left over from 2 apps, so save some cash. Nachos are basically a soggy mess if you are hoping for hungover leftovers!"}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed Teakwoods and have been coming here for many years. We visited yesterday to find many changes... The service was mediocre at best, first  we ordered wings which Teakwood's has some of the best wings around however when you price them over a dollar a wing it's just becomes ridiculous. The server  gave us a flyer that talked about a shortage of chicken and that they were doing a temporary $3 increase as a surcharge on all wings. $29 for 2 dozen wings is outrageous! I haven't heard any other restaurant that offers wings say anything about a chicken shortage.They also no longer offer $6 beer pitchers and we were swayed to order a 22 once beer instead. Overall, for a family of 4 with only 2 drafts along with our regular drinks and food our bill was just over $70. Very disappointing, sadly we might as well stay close to home with better food and service at Cheeseburgers and Beer."}
{"text":"We had a Groupon elsewhere we couldn't use so had to trade it in and took a chance because we read they have great wings.  Both my husband and son love wings (spicy is something I can't eat) so we decided to try it.

I have to say that I am not a big fan of peanuts all over the floor because I seem to bring it into my car-but for the kiddos who love them, it was a blast!

We ordered the wings and crispy (not a fan of fatty) and when they came they were devoured!  They were perfectly cooked, not too spicy and 2 dozen was perfect for two people.  

We also got to talk to and thank the manager (Matthew I think) and wanted to say that you should give them a try.  There is a surcharge right now due to shortage, but it was worth it for sure!"}
{"text":"Purchased a living social deal to try this place out. I LOVE that they have delicious cheese curds (a must try) & free peanuts & $6 pitchers during happy hour. Their burgers on the other hand were awful. So bad my husband only ate one or two bites... 

We will most definitely try it again, but minus the burger next time!"}
{"text":"Went to Teakwoods Friday night and had an amazing time. The food was great and happy hour deals were good. Best thing about the night was our server, Mitch (aka Mitchell or tall guy). He was so kind, attentive, funny, and enjoyable. He made sure we always had full drinks. I noticed he didn't pass any table without making sure people were doing alright. Always  ask for Mitch when you're there and tip him well!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for wings (Jess Jess) and drinks. All of the food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The bucket of peanuts at every table gives you something to snack on right away. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Decent food. Slow service. Their El Heffe wings are our favorite! Grilled chicken wings with spicy sauce.  Gets pretty crowded during friday and saturday dinner time"}
{"text":"I rather go to Native or Zipps... We have had bad expierence after bad expierence here. If you are craving wings, this isn't the spot for you."}
{"text":"Out of a dozen visits, its still a tossup if I'd recommend it. The service, food, and ambiance varies greatly from day to day and also lunch to dinner.

The good:
- This is where I come for wings. They have a great selection of flavors & sauces, and after having wings elsewhere, I came back to Teakwoods. Generally, the wings are big, juicy, and slathered with sauce.
-Daily specials, always something new
-Peanuts at your table while you wait
-TV screens everywhere
-Live music on the weekends
-Occasionally they offer Groupon deals- $15 for $30 of food? Yes please!
-Happy hour specials (though I've never once made it here during their selected times)

The bad:
-Drinks. Both alcohol and nonalcoholic drinks here leave much to be desired.
   * The bartender has a very weak pour on their daily specials, so what looks like a good deal at $3.50 a glass will end up taking you 2x as many drink orders as normal.
  * I think they use tap water for their teas and drinking water. It taste so horrible, I've had to send drinks back several times and I just don't order them now. If you are thirsty, get a soda.
-Food quality during lunch hour. You'll have better luck around dinnertime, but slower service. Lunches here have been disappointing about 50% of the time. 
-During sports games, you do NOT want to bring your family here, even if its right after church. It will be super crowded and don't be surprised if you are seated next to a boisterous, foulmouthed gang of disrespectful adults who scream their heads off every goal.
-Prices jumped 15% after they got voted 'Best of Phoenix' for their wings."}
{"text":"Food is descent, kid friendly atmosphere.. But good grief is the service incredibly slow."}
{"text":"Been going to Teakwoods for years now and I must say their food has always been really good, and consistent. You can never go wrong with their wings, burgers, and sandwiches. Oh, and the pretzels with the dipping cheese is probably the best I've had. You gotta try them!! I am kinda sad though! Over the last year or so I see this place going north.. The majority of the employees have zero sense of urgency for customers for the exception of the two little Mexican brothers that work there. I always see them greeting, smiling, and just talking to people. I can see it effecting this place cause the only time it's really busy is on Fridays from about 5-9pm.. Other than that it's become a ghost town. In addition, I can never seem to get a carbonated beer. They all taste a little flat so I just stick to bottled beer, or we just go to Jerseys for the beer and Teakwoods for the food."}
{"text":"Found this place thanks to Gilbert's \"Follow Friday\" tweet a few weeks ago and was immediately drawn in by their Moose logo (moose are my favorite!), so I convinced my husband we should go here for dinner. I had a burger and fries that were great, he had some tacos that he really enjoyed, and we both loved the cookie pie dessert. I daresay we will be back, especially to try trivia!"}
{"text":"They have pretty good daily and happy hour specials on drinks. The food is a tad pricey imho, but it is good.

Ordered the jess jess wings they were nice and crisp, flavorful...but I do tend to like my wings a little saucier and I couldn't taste or see the bleu cheese crumbles.

Also ordered the burger with the green chili and tots. It was solid, but a little under-seasoned for my liking. 

I would definitely go back and try some other wings."}
{"text":"2nd visit to this place since moving across the coast... it doesn't disappoint... drinks and food rock.... looking forward to coming here on Sundays to watching football, refueling, and trying to get some homework done all the same time after Sunday hikes."}
{"text":"I am writing this entire review about Teakwood's new horseradish pickles.  They are officially my new favorite thing in the world.  Sweet spicy delicious in one glorious bite. They need to be featured as an appetizer in my opinion.

The menu was recently revamped, lots of new tasty dishes.  And of course the nightly specials are still fresh and yummy.  

Come hungry and thirsty ... This place will definitely meet your expectations!"}
{"text":"What happened to this place? I have been going there for years and always seemed decent, food was good and drinks where good. Well I have not been back in a few months due to  busy schedule and have to say I am not happy with this bar anymore. Come on guys at least shut down one day and clean the place, It's filthy, look at the window seals and all you see is dirty and dust build-up. You took the old seat covers and hung them on the wall, Take that down, looks cheap. Service was slow, and food is WAY below previous visits. HMM, All this started within the last few months. I bet a good manager could figure this out, You have crappy employees not doing there jobs. My wife's salad was wilted and seemed old, She got sick after eating it and we had to go home, nice Friday night (not). My chicken was dry and seemed to be cooked beyond done. Advise, You use to have decent cooks there, Now I bet none of them know English very well and are just there for a check. Your front staff seems they cant wait to get out of there. Oh and when you clean the beer taps, Flush the chemical out before you tap a keg, It makes the beer taste like crap. I really think the owner should do a undercover boss routine here and fix this place back the way it use to be... I wont be coming back."}
{"text":"meh, got dragged here by some people for the sport bar effect , guess who isn't  into sports?........Any way  the place was dead and the freaking sound was up so loud I almost has to yell to have a conversation with the people across from me. Woke up the next day with a sore throat....the food looks like cheesy bar food and the Waite staff had to be told who ordered what , and who ordered how many drinks, unreal. Then we were given some one else s bill..........enough said"}
{"text":"The food wasn't too bad. My quesadillas were actually pretty tasty. The place was really dirty though. The staff was nice, but the booths were still covered in food after they wiped them in front of us."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places as they never disappoint! The Blanco lavosh was a special today that really must be added to the menu. Fantastic and not soggy!!!! The veg lavosh is my favorite - or should I say was my favorite until I had this one!

Brought family with us who are visiting from both NJ and CA....they really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. Candlestick Carver and the gyro were fast favorites. Seasonal beers hit the spot!"}
{"text":"This place is well rounded.

-Great large wings (can actually get suicide wings which fit the name)
-Tasty sandwiches (Candlestick carver is yummy)
-Monthly beer specials, good beer selection
-Moosehead is always on special
-Plenty of free peanuts
-Sports an plenty of large TVs
-Daily Specials and HH deals

Relaxed and casual  good go to spot when group is indecisive on food type."}
{"text":"First time here and I will try to remember it is a sports bar and it is a bit close to the burbs for us but \"Groupon\" reeled us in.

 Just ordered apps (rings and fingers). Atmosphere is definitely sports bar flat screens everywhere.  Live band the night we were there (Fri Aug 19). 15 minutes for appetizers they better be good...  Such a let down."}
{"text":"If you like rancid peanuts go for it.  First bucket was bad, took another from another table and told the waitress.  I actually think she put those first rancid nuts into the community bowl near the entrance, only surmise.  Next bucket - from another table were also rancid.  Ask my Grand daughter if she would come come back and she mirrored the Wife with a big NO.  Rest of food was mediocre.  The staff to customer ratio was about 18 customers to 13 staff, still slow service.  This was a Saturday afternoon with the Kentucky Derby on.  The empty place says it all!"}
{"text":"I've frequented Teakwoods for the past 10 years. And this place has changed for the worse. It used to be a trendy ski-lodge Wisconsin-Colorado bar with cute and friendly waitresses. The crowd used to be a young educated crowd who would come here for drinks before venturing out to Scottsdale or Tempe.  

Now, it almost feels like a glorified Applebees.  The crowd has gotten older. You see a lot of good ole boys and meatheads eat here. The waitresses transformed from being fun and cute girls that you would see in a trendy Tempe bar to homely girls who don't smile and seem to hate their life.  Whatever was fun and charming about this place has been lost.  Don't worry, Teakwoods will always be busy because the Applebees crowd is going to continue to flock to this place because the food and prices are excellent. However, the service and vibe has taken a major hit. I would recommend Zipps or Payton's place before Teakwoods.

In terms of watching sports, this isn't a great place. Not all of the TV's are flat screens and nearly all the TV's in that side room have old school TV's with bad reception.  They also don't have common sense in regards to programming. For example, they had the nerve to have soccer playing on several of the TV's during March Madness."}
{"text":"In the mood for a really good burger and a beer, a delicious bar pizza or super tasty wings, all while watching sports on tv and still being able to talk to the person you're with?  If so, then Teakwoods is the place for you.

The food is a good value and the servers are attentive. It's a hopping place. My favorite part of the total experience was shelling and eating peanuts and then throwing the shells on the floor.

A happy crowd seems to gravitate to this bar/restaurant.  I liked it."}
{"text":"Ok, so the food was great! It took forever to get drinks and when we did the waitress (Maggie) was very unprofessional, rude, acted like she hates life. We all have bad days but this is her job. Overall I'd highly recommend Teakwoods and request any waitress other than Maggie."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food at Teakwoods.  Their menu is very well developed and has many delicious choices.  I can't think of a better choice for bar food in Chandler.  They also have a nice beer selection.  

I generally grab takeout from here... They've never messed up the order and it has always been on time."}
{"text":"With peanuts on the table and hulls on the floor it must be good! Sierra did an excellent job of ordering, serving and billing. BLT sandwich with Tomato Basil soup was very good. Same for the Terrible (their name not mine)turkey sandwich with onion rings. Groupon was readily accepted. Will be back but the sandwiches are too big."}
{"text":"I am not a wing person and I am OBSESSED with the wings as Teakwoods!!!  The Jess Jess wings are unbelievable and I could eat 100!  They truly have the BEST wings I have ever had and my boyfriend agrees and he definetly has had a lot of wings in his lifetime.  The manager/maybe owner? is amazing.  He is so friendly everytime we go in there and takes the time to chat with us.  One time our wings were taking a really long time and he ended up giving us a really good deal which wasn't necessary but definetly appreciated.  Also they have tots for a side which is something I have an awkward obsession for too."}
{"text":"Went here with a big group last night to watch the ASU/UA game and was really surprised at what great service we received. Despite it being a busy night and our group being large and loud, our waitress was totally on top of everything. We ate and drank a LOT and were there for about five hours.

The wings were great...HOT does mean hot here :-) And I was surprised at how well my veggie burger came out.

I would totally suggest coming here with a group to watch a game or hang, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Meh. I've loved the other Teakwood (on Ray Rd.) for a long time and can't say enough good things about it. This one is no where near as good. The food is still very good but the service is awful. I've gone twice and both times were not busy but service was extremely slow. I waited a very long time for basic things like more water, the check, etc. I recommend the Teakwood on Ray Rd. but not this one."}
{"text":"This is a good sports bar type environment, family friendly. Service can be a little inconsistent but overall the food is good and environment is chill."}
{"text":"Teakwoods is not my usual type of spot but i just love it. I love the peanut shells on the floor, watching bizarre customers, great drink specials, and GREAT bar food. This is another place where I have yet to order something bad here. I love their Mac and cheese...it was much nicer than i expected from the look of the place! Their pretzel rolls are so good too. Moist, soft, and covered with butter.

Wings, sandwiches, beer...theyve got it all! It would be a great place to watch a game with friends if I liked watching games."}
{"text":"I was really surprised that this place got so many good reviews. We visited last night on a Groupon ($15 for $30 dollars worth of food). We ordered sliders and wings, two pitchers of beer....over $100 bucks when all was said and done.  The food looked great, but was cold and really substandard.

On an \"up\" side, the waitress was really nice, but appeared to be the only server on duty. I'm sure this accounted for the cold food.

I say if you want to be great, be great every night, including Mondays."}
{"text":"We had flat \"affect\" waiter.  Yes, our waiter had about as much personality as Data on Star Trek the Next Generation. On another occassion, our waitress left us on the island. You know what I mean, \"here is your food, I will check on you in 45 minutes and see if you are still alive then\"  Then one fine day, we had \"Alcohol Only\" waitress. Our waitress was friendly at first until she realized we were not going to order a bevy of drinks and rack up a thick bill and hang out for an hour. We were immediately disqualified from good service the rest of the evening. On another occassion, we had the \"The Flash\"  You know this waitress. If you don't know already know what you want to order and have questions, you are given a penalty. If you ask her for her opinion, she says in a very stoned face and quick manner \"it's good\" no descriptors, no recommendations but simply \"It's good\"  Then if you pause even for  a second, she says \"I will be right back let me get this other table their drinks really quickly while I give you time to decide\"  Then we had \"Charity Case\" waitress. This waitress is probably a hardworking college student or a mother of 5 at the age of 25 who hasn't slept in 3 days. Because of her situation, it is our job as patrons to be considerate and aware of her situation so if she messes up our order, forgets to refill our drinks, or gives us a dirty look if we ask for ketchup\" we are supposed to forget all that.

CONCLUSION: So you are probably wondering if the service is so bad, why do I keep coming here, the food is actually pretty good and it's darn right cheap! Seriously, you can have a full dinner for 20 bucks. It's bar food done well. But what I like is the food still tastes like bard food. It's not haughty gourmet bar food that you find at Jillys or Peyton's Place. I don't want a kaiser roll for my burger, I want a normal bun! I don't want sweet potato fries, I want regular fries! t's just sad because if the service improved, we would come here more often. The only warning with regard to the food is to stick to the classic bar food items. If you see \"shrimp\" , \"scallop\" or anything that sounds like it could be offerred at a real restaurant, don't order this item. It's rather funny because people who had bad experiences here ordered the \"Jalapeno Shrimp Caesar salad Wrap\"..oklay that item doesn't exist but you get the idea.. Think burger, nachos, fried cheese, chicken sanwhich! Outside of those items, the food is prepared in a replicator hence the reason it doesn't taste good. The servers come in that rare cross breed of ASU apathy with \"West Side\" sensibility. I would also recommend you adhere to it's strict dress code if you want good service.

{"text":"Horrible manager! She told us we only needed to wait 25 minutes and we ended up waiting an hour. She just had excuses up the wall. Thank goodness the Jack Daniels is only $3"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Great burgers. 

Drinks are good and very reasonably priced. 

Two staff members got in an argument while I was there and one was escorted out. 

That being said, I still like the place."}
{"text":"We have been going to Teakwoods for several years and the good is always great! One of our favorite places to watch games too! Great drink specials."}
{"text":"Initially, my thought was to give Teakwoods four starts.  Then I started writing my review . . . 

I can't speak to the other locations, as I have never been, but this Teakwoods is pretty awesome.  

The atmosphere here is chill. The food is great! Good, strong drinks and good beer selection. Casual friendly service. The list goes on and on.  I've been coming here for years.  I even think this was the first stop on my 21st birthday celebration many moons ago . . . YIKES!  

They have lots of TVs for the sports fans.  I will happily come here to \"watch the game\" because I know that I'm not going to have to sacrifice getting a good meal.  There are even healthy options if that's my goal for the day.

I love the daily drink and quesadilla specials! There are usually 4-5 drinks on special every day, plus a beer of the month, and already great prices on everything else.  The daily specials food menu ensures there is always something new on the menu for the regulars. 

The Buffalo Chicken Lavosh is fantastic (see pic), however I don't advise eating it alone, even the \"half\" size is huge!  The salads are good; and I am picky about my salads!  Chicken sandwiches are great.  Sliders are legit.  Wings are some of the biggest and best around!  Gyros are tasty with the nice soft pita bread.  They have vegetarian options too!  Oh, and breakfast!  I wasn't kidding, the list does go \"on and on!\"

A few other details, Teak's has a great juke box and a semi-separate room next door for families or big groups, it's a little less bar-ish.  Even if there isn't a game on (really, does that happen anymore?) there is always a good time to be had a Teakwoods.

The more I write about how solid this place is, I have know idea why I was only going to give it four stars. So, I figure, \"What the heck?\" 

As far as sports bars go, Teakwoods is as good as it gets! In fact, it is really more than just a sports bar, it is a great restaurant and bar plus sports.

Five stars it is!"}
{"text":"this is located in what used to be a pretty happening strip mall because there was one of the only movie theaters around there.
then a new googaplex opened and the whole area kind of dwindled. 
wings are good, i attest to that. but... random shooting where a person dies and four others have to go to the hospital? not really my idea of good time."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with my experience at Teakwoods in Phx.  Wasn't sure what to expect as I had only heard you \"throw peanut shells on the floor\".  I love the fact that the menu offers vegetarian options.  Next time I'm getting the veggie Lavosh, it looks awesome!!  The tv's had the Suns playoff game on and it was amazing as there are tons of tv's.  Plus, $2 Mexican Imports on Wednesdays, can't beat that!!   Our server was awesome and the whole atmosphere screamed \"good times\".  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Don't order the wings anymore due to the high price and surcharge. The philly steak cheese is amazing. Made with ribeye and great non soggy bread. We always ask for Mitch when we visit. He is the best and our favorite server in town."}
{"text":"Love the wings here! I love them crispy! All of the sauces are so good! We come here way too often..."}
{"text":"Groupon is a great deal, but even at full price this is an awesome place to eat!
Food is super delicious and service is always above and beyond! 
We've had about 2/3 of the menu over many visits and have never been disappointed...a true feat in the restaurant biz in this day and age!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow really great place. I threw my bf a surprise birthday party here...which at first I thought was a nice bar and grill but the morning of the party I drove 30 minutes here to drop off the cake....and was kinda shock to find that it was kinda like a dive bar. Usually I wouldn't pick places like that but since it was a party of 30, I wasn't going to change the place just because there's peanut shells all over the place. But really it turned out to be a great place that had a perfect area that sat all 30 of us. 

The service was really wonderful...when I called in to make the reservation twice...since at first I thought it would only be a party of 10 but more people decided to come so it went up to 30, the guy that took the reservation was really nice about it, even asked me if I was bringing a cake. The waitress that served us was also pretty awesome.

The portions of the food was huge and cheap and oOoh the wings are a bomb and what was even better was for Tuesdays it's only $6.50 for a dozen of any flavor wings. 

Overall I am very satisfied and happy with this place and the party was a hit...although I think we were their biggest party there because if it wasn't for us I think the place would have been pretty dead....There weren't too many people there for dinner. 

Anyways I would happily come back here."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to get some decent wings. Working in San Jose all the time, I've struggled to find a good wing place. Smoke Eaters isn't bad, but it pales in comparison to this place...
The service here is usually top notch. Although sometimes they get really busy and you end up having to wait a bit, but that's with any decent restaurant... The fact that they are always busy should tell you that the food and beer is pretty damn good.
I haven't really tried any of the other food here besides the wings... Although my wife said that their sliders are pretty good as well.
As for the atmosphere, it's noisy, fun, and you get to throw peanuts and peanut shells at your friends, or on the floor... whichever.

So, some friendly advice... If you like REALLY spicy wings, get the Suicide wings... The flavor is great, and they have one hellofa kick!
If you like a little bit of heat with a LOT of flavor, get the El Heffe wings. They are delicious and have a wonderful garlicy flavor. Usually I get half El Heffe and half Suicide...

The other wings here are delicious as well, just depends on your tastes and how spicy you want them."}
{"text":"Descent boneless wings, cold beer, good variety on the menu.  Our waitress was attentive."}
{"text":"AWESOME! Diablo burger was amazing, the service was super friendly and inviting. The peanuts were fun- lots if tvs with sports. The Groupon was unbelievable - make sure to get that before you come.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Good place!! Bartender was really nice!! I had a great lunch and I will be back soon! The happy hour was great and the food was really good for bar food"}
{"text":"I rarely enjoy bar food, but Teakwoods is a exception. I'm very impressed by their menu, and they always have great specialties in addition to their regular menu.
While there isn't much of a scene here late nights, it's a great spot for happy hour. The drinks are cheap, and the casual atmosphere makes it a great place to unwind. Who doesn't love tossing peanut shells on the floor?"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner on a Friday evening. There was about a 15 minute wait for a table. They had an area out front to wait so it wasn't bad. The place was really busy which is a good sign I think. The service was wonderful. I had the mac n cheese and it was seriously the best I've ever had. I used to go to the House of Brews for mac n cheese but they are closed now and I'm so glad I decided to have it at Teakwoods because it is THE BEST! I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and atmosphere!

Atmosphere - Very casual bar that offers [dangerously addictive] peanuts by the bucket load that can be disposed of via the floor. I like it!

Drinks -  They have a great happy hour [everyday!] from 2-7 and a great selection of beers. 

Food - Really good! Burgers are huge and cooked as perfectly as you requested it. I couldnt even eat half my meal it was so big. Eating too many peanuts prior may also have been a reason... O:)

Service - Fast and attentive! 

I will definitely be back. Fun atmosphere, good service, and great happy hour specials :)"}
{"text":"Let's get past the fact that this place is crowded, loud, and the floor is littered with peanut shells. This is to be expected, so I am going to comment on what I want from a sports bar. 

There are plenty of flat screen T.V.'s for viewing whatever football game you want. There are also good beer specials, and the bartenders kick ass.

Now for the bar food: Fantastic. Whether it's wings, sandwiches or even soup, it is all good. Try the turkey dip or the Candlestick Carver. Both are succulent, and they use good quality bread here. The steak fries are done perfectly. Great neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"4.5/5 for sports bar food/atmosphere

Something is going to kill me someday and it might as well be bacon.  This place has the best BLT I have ever had.  They bread and fry the tomatoes, folks.  I had never heard of that before.  Eating the BLT at Teakwoods has made me want to start a Yelp list of the best BLTs.  It's that good.  Go get it.  With the sweet potato waffle fries.  It just can't be beat.

The last time we were there we also tried the 1/2 bacon cheeseburger lavosh.  That was delicious too.  First of all, the 1/2 lavosh are HUGE!  I don't know what I'd do if we ever got a full-size one.  Probably have to drag another table over to make room for that monster.  The bacon cheeseburger one has ground beef, onions, tomatoes, bacon, lettuce, cheese, and a thousand island drizzle.  Tastes like a Big Mac if a Big Mac actually contained good-quality hamburger.  Perfect with a couple of cold beers.  

So a BLT and the lavosh weren't enough on our last visit.  Apparently we had to order even more food and also had the shrimp and chips entree.  I wasn't expecting anything beyond average, but this again was pretty damn tasty with a big serving of fried shrimp and steak fries.  Everything was cooked perfectly and not greasy at all.  They also have jalapeno cole slaw, and you know what a wuss I am when it comes to anything spicy, but I ended up enjoying that as well.  Good cole slaw taken to great with that nice jalapeno flavor.  We ended up leaving with 3 togo containers that day!  

We've been to all of the Teakwoods locations several times and really enjoy a few things.  First, the employees have always been friendly and efficient, they take bar food and put a little twist on it to make it different and more delicious than you would think, and they usually have some pretty good drink choices.   They don't water down their drinks like those pinheads at Zipps, and there are always a bunch of TVs tuned to the sporting event of your choice as well.  Teakwoods is definitely one of our favorite sports bars in the area."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and I'm going back this coming weekend.
They are known for their delicious wings and I have to admit, they are the best wings I've ever had!  The staff was extremely nice and the service was fast which was surprising considering how packed they were.  I only wish there was a location closer to my house!  People of Teakwoods, if you're reading this, please bring a location to East Mesa!!  ;)"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend since Teakwood was hosting a free poker tournament. It's a typical neighborhood bar except the theme of this place is that they offer large buckets of shelled peanuts to snack on while you wait for your order and you discard the shells on the ground giving it this dirty shell shavings kinda look. Just a note - if you have a peanut allergy, avoid this place!

anywho since it was lunch when we were there, i ordered myself a Turkey Dip and my friend an Open the Hatch Burger. Side item choices were fries, side salad, fruit, tater tots, onion rings, or sweet potato fries. I got tater tots with mine, and her's with fries. 

Service was quick, and the portions huge. The turkey dip was nothing special, quite regular bar food not exceptional and not bad either. Tater tots were crispy and seemed store bought. The burgers are huge and a real mouthful, from what I hear it's ok. Prices are moderate as well. So, anyways if you're looking for a neigborhood bar to watch the game, and looking for a place for a bite to eat, Teakwoods is fine but it's nothing special."}
{"text":"Found this place thru a GroupOn. Love the cheap draft cider and I recommend the Cheese Curds.

The two best things on the menu: Diego's Mac n Cheese - its amazing and the Pretzel Appetizer (I doubt I will ever find another as good).

Perfect for a quick low-key meal.

Downside - peanut shells on the floor - not my thing."}
{"text":"We ended up here because another place we were going to go was closed. I'm glad we did stop by because the food was great. 

First we ordered the cheese curds. Delicious. The waiter said they were better than the mozzarella sticks, and I do believe we made the right choice to get them. I didn't try the mozzarella sticks, but I didn't need to. These cheese curds were rad. 

Our friends ordered the wings with honey hot sauce. They were good wings. I'm more of a medium girl myself, so I didn't eat many of them. The flavor was good though. 

My girlfriend and I split the cheeseburger sliders. They come with three sliders and your choice of side (fries, tator tots, etc). We got the tator tots to complete the meal. The waiter knew we were splitting it, so our food came out on two separate plates. One of the sliders was even cut in half for us. It was nice of them do that for us. Sharing on one plate is always so annoying. 

They had drink specials going on, so we got vodka drinks. They also had $5 house wine, so we tried a glass of the pinot grigio. Not very good, but it was $5. It is what it is. 

The entire experience was pretty nice. The food was good, and the drink specials were on point."}
{"text":"Reminds me of a place back home in Ohio called Brass Pelican. Peanut shells on the floor and great food.
I always get the honey BBQ hot wings traditional styles and grilled. I always can catch a game on one of the dozen televisions. And the waitress is always nice and great on the eyes.
If you're looking for great food with out the restaurant uptight styling, this is your place. Nice and relaxed. 
And always great people and food!"}
{"text":"I've been there twice now and I am not impressed.  The food is WAY overpriced for the quality you get.  The service is so-so....no one seems to really care or are very friendly at all.  For my husband, myself and our young son it was $40!  

The waitress suggested the boneless wings to my husband because they were cheaper than the bone in and boy was that a mistake!  All he could taste was the breading and barely any chicken - they were dry and gross.

I had the green chili burger and left half...it was a nasty mess...no real taste or flavor but fell apart when I tried to eat it.

the only good thing I can say was good were the homemade chips...I liked those a lot but its not enough to ever get me to go back here."}
{"text":"Our go-to spot for wings, for sure!  My family can take some heat, so we usually get an order of HOT and an order of THAI CINA, which has honey hot sauce with fresh basil and red pepper flakes...ask for them \"sloppy\" to get extra saucy goodness!  Every single thing I've ordered over the years has been top-notch in quality and flavor.  Some standouts are:  Ultimate BLT (with a fries green tomato for the T!), Jack Not Jill, Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, Topless Roast Beef Dinner, Tekas Touch 'Em All. Oh, and their fried zucchini is outstanding!"}
{"text":"It's a lazy Sunday afternoon, and I'm looking through my Groupons, figuring out where I'm going for an early dinner today.  Now I live in West Mesa, and don't want to drive very far, but I have promised myself that I'm going to start using my Groupons as they expire, and this one was the next.  It's only about 12 miles, so Megan and I say, what the heck, let's go.  

The minute you walk in you feel welcome at this place.  Peanuts on the floor, lots of TVs, lots of regulars, comfortable booths, and they greet you as soon as you walk in the door.  Our server was Sabrina (I think) and she was great start to finish.  From the moment we walked in the door through  extra stuff requested and refills too.  Always there, but not in your face.  

I had a Turkey Dip Sandwich with the steak fries and a salad.  Megan had the French Dip Sandwich with curly fries and a salad, with two large diet Pepsi (wishing for Coke).  Bread was ok, turkey tasted great.  Steak fries were good.  Didn't really care for the turkey au jus that was served with the turkey, so didn't use that much.  Megan's French Dip sandwich was great all the way down to the au jus.   She really liked the curly fries,  The only complaint I had on this place was the ranch dressing was not cold...maybe it was just made, I'm not sure?  But I like cold dressing on my salad.  

Food was good, but I have to tell you what would bring me back was the atmosphere.  Loved this place, and will drive to it again!"}
{"text":"Great food, sweet staff, cool atmosphere, annnd family friendly :) A++"}
{"text":"Yesterday I came into Teakwoods with 29 of my great friends on a bike pub crawl. I just have to say how impressed I was with the server named Jordan. She does not skip a beat and was an awesome server for all 30 of us. She must have a photographic memory because even though we were all switching places some of us were standing,  some were sitting, and some were kind of wandering around, hanging out with different people in the group, Jordan always knew whose drink was whose what which food order belonged where. I am so utterly impressed. Jordan, you are A+ in my book! I'm so glad we chose Teakwood's as one of our stops on our bike pub crawl. A fantastic time was had by all!"}
{"text":"Two visits and I'm just not that into the food.  I like the bucket of peanuts at each table, and I certainly like the chicken wings. Beyond that, I have not been impressed with the food. Burgers are just ho-hum. My wife reports that the BLT is nothing special.  For a similar type of place that serves much better chow in the East Valley, try \"Blue 32.\""}
{"text":"Food is really good, portions are big so opportunity to share or binge :-). Kids meals are excellent. Too bad there was a complete uncouth mouth breather moron behind us who swore and belched out loud the entire time. I mean seriously who belches out loud when they aren't 19 and at a frat party?"}
{"text":"Wings, wings, wings!!!  Love their specialty Jess Jess and El Heffe wings, they are outstanding!"}
{"text":"Good solid place to go if you want to hang out with friends, drink a few beers and watch 5 different football games going on at once.  Service started out a little slow when but got better as the night went on. We stuck around for 7 hours and the server never seemed in a rush for us to leave, so you have to appreciate that since 7 hours is a long time to tie up seats.  She was also pretty nice when we tried splitting the bill between cards and cash; I know how much of a pain that can be and it was a Saturday to boot.

I didn't eat but one of my friends did, and the lavosh looked pretty darn good.  Judging by the way he mowed through the entire thing, I'm going to say he thought it was pretty outstanding too. It was the buffalo chicken one.

Yeah, the place is noisy, and peanut shells are everywhere, but it's a sports bar and that's what you'd expect there.  They also have a great selection of beers, both on tap and bottled; I hate when I go somewhere and only have a couple choices of the same mediocre beers everyone has.

And of course, if you're hungry, try the wings!"}
{"text":"Decent food but slow service and they do not honor the promotions they post on Facebook!"}
{"text":"Neat place, servers were friendly and helpful. I had the beef dip, it was one of the better ones I've had. The menu was a little boring they should add some more interesting items."}
{"text":"My fave sports bar. Amazing food, great service. Pnut shells on the floor... must have menu items are the Jess Jess wings, pretzel sticks and edamame... but honestly everything I've had there is good. For the vegetarians, try this... Patty Melt with a veggie patty and add breaded tomatoes... even non vegetarians will love it!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Cold Beer and best wings in town. El Hefe are my favorite. They are not sloppy but grilled and excellent. I have never had a bad meal here and I go here about twice a month. Servers have always been very helpful and fast. They will split a dish if you request it which is great as the portions are large. I go here about once or twice a month."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, met a buddy there for lunch today. It was not so good. First of all, the table, booths and menus were sticky to the touch. The drink menu on the table was covered in dried food. Just don't get the sense that they clean much there. 

Then there was the food. Not very good. We both had burgers and both thought they sucked. Very very poor quality meat used for patties. Then there was the beer. Completely flat out of the tap. No thanks. not sure where all the good Yelp reviews came from. It was no good"}
{"text":"Walked in & figured typical burger joint, then after waiting almost 5 minutes to be approached we knew we'd be in for it. Oh how we were so right especially after having our order in for about 20 or so minutes & our server Maryann comes back to let us know sorry forgot to put your order in. Gosh really, we then get our food & yeah it looked awesome & well worth the wait until I cut it in half & bit into a veryyyyy dryyyyy chicken breast. Beyond disappointing & will definitely not be returning. It's a definite hit or miss with these groupons sorry to say, it's all a gamble & I'm no longer sure if it's worth the gamble!!"}
{"text":"I live across the street from this location and have been going here since 2003. Their food is so much better than your average bar food. I have taken quite a few pictures through the years of some of my favorites and added them on here. I absolutely love their wings especially the Jess Jess (Medium sauce with garlic and bleu chees crumbles) and the El Hefe (garlic and cilantro). I have tried so many of the menu items that I could go on and on. Everything is just so good here. They also have great beer specials all week. It's probably a good thing that they don't have NTN trivia here or I would be here all the time."}
{"text":"My husband was hungry so we stopped here to take advantage of a Living Social deal we had. 

I ordered iced tea and a jack not Jill to go (I wasn't hungry). The good looked good with the exception of the bacon that was so overdone that I removed it. 

My husband had roast beef sliders. He said that the meat was moist and tender but completely lacked flavor. He was confused at how something with roast beef, fried onions, cheese and horseradish sauce could lack flavor but it did. He ordered steak fries as his side and I ordered the curly fries so he could try both. He said they weren't bad but nothing special. 

He also ordered the happy house appetizer platter with fried cheese, potato skins, onion rings and pretzel sticks. It was large and decent but probably not something we would order again. My iced tea was large and fresh. Great for a hot day. 

Service was very friendly and excellent. 

All in all, with the LS deal it was worth it but the food was average. My husband said he would go again to try other food as it seemed to be decent quality but would try different items."}
{"text":"Service was great, but the food wasn't. Nachos were disgusting because they used canned chili which had an awful aftertaste and ground meat that was devoid of any flavor, even salt and pepper. The combo platter was just ok -  deep fried and bland. We live close by so we were hoping it was great but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for lunch today, since we are always looking for different and good places for a quick lunch.  We were rather disappointed.  My GF ordered a cup of chili and some chicken tacos with a side order of string cut fries.  The fries were OK, but the cup of chili was canned chili, and some cheap canned stuff as well.  The chicken tacos were made with boiled shredded chicken on some cold flour tortillas with some salad material thrown on top of it.  Not a very good lunch at all.  And to top this off, they charged her $.50 extra for cheese on the chili, and $.50 extra of chopped white onions.....maybe about 1 oz. each; and there is no mention of this upcharge for chili toppings.  I ordered the GodMother Sub....supposedly \"not for the faint of heart\".  I have had a better Italian sub at Subway and for about $6 less.  It came with string fries too (OK), and I ordered a small green salad.....nothing special and dressing from a bottle.  To be fair, this meal was not horrible, but I was expecting something a little better......Red Robin, Chili's, Applebee's all have lunches and sandwiches that were better.  And their competitor right in the same shopping strip mall, Copper Still Moonshine Grill, has better food."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town. Not super impressed. The service was very slow. I had to ask multiple times for silverware. When the food arrived, the fried were like warm to cold."}
{"text":"Love this place!  We always try other bars & end up wishing we'd gone to teaks.  Yes, it's loud & the tv setup is just ok.  But, you cannot beat their food.  The special salmon salad, usually on Fridays is delicious.  Great sammies & wings too.  The special menu always has interesting stuff.  Good for drinking, but never too rowdy."}
{"text":"First off...try the meatloaf and soft pretzel sticks..sooo good lol....I've been here quiet a few times and its been a pretty good experience...drinks are a little pricey when comparing to a place like Native New Yorker but its still a good place to hang with friends"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid and it's always been a favorite of my parents. Their salads are great and their wings are good as well. One thing that is consistently lacking is the customer service. The waiters never really seem like they want to be there. During our last visit, my sister made a special request for extra of something and she received not much extra at all, with a hefty price tag. She joked that next time she'd bring her own extra in her purse for a third of the price and to avoid the attitude. Fairly recently, they began charging a wing surcharge because of a wing \"crisis\" by which only they seem to be effected. Nowhere else across the US have I visited where this surcharge is in place. And not only do they tell you about the charge, but they hand out flyers with information about it. It's really tacky and unnecessary. Just up the price on the menu and call it a day. There's lots of noise inside where the bar and games are, so if you're looking for family time be sure to request outdoor seating!"}
{"text":"We eat here often. This was our go to place for wings. We will no longer be going here. The owner of the place has horrible customer service skills. Paid over $50 and forgot to use my coupon and they wouldn't even work with me. With so many choices for wings, and good sports bars in this area, save yourself the trouble of rude owners. Zips here we come!"}
{"text":"This place has great food and great atmospheres. My favorite nights to go are on Friday nights. After 9pm they have trivia night which is one of the best in town. They also have reverse happy hour."}
{"text":"As a Phoenix native homegrown on the west side... I loved a local favorite over there. Moved across town and needed a new wing place! Incidentally enough, Teakwoods was always in competition with my favorite place on the west side for best wings! 

Wings taste almost the same. That same fantastic deep fried fully cooked vinegary wing with buffalo sauce. 

My favorite is the medium wings, however hubs and our friend loves the Hot. 

Definitely try the Suicide if you're into hot stuff, but know you're gonna tell that toilet who's boss later on. Flushable baby wipes.  You're welcome. 

The beer deals and salads and the ambiance is pretty cool. 

Not super busy... more of a middle aged crowd. They do have a baby changing table in the family bathroom on the family side, FYI. I was told by a young server that she didn't think they had one... no, they do.  Can't blame her... before I had kids I didn't think about it either. 

This is my favorite wing place! Will always go back."}
{"text":"Dirty floors, dirty peanuts, and the worst customer service you are ever going to experience. That's \"Teakwoods\" in a nutshell.

Sometimes a good dive bar can be fun. That is, when the bar is clean. While Teakwoods likes to position themselves as something above a dive bar, the environment they foster isn't much better than that. There are peanuts everywhere. I love peanuts, but these things are dusty and dirty, and they sit around in huge containers on the tables. Instead of supplying fresh peanuts every day, these guys must buy them in bulk and store them in a shed somewhere, bringing them in by the shovel to put on tables once a week. A week's supply of dirty, filthy peanuts on your table to wash down with your beer. Just what I want to look at when I am eating a meal!

The food is absolutely nothing to rave about. The wings are just \"so so\" . . . the only thing I found I liked there was the supply of cheap beer. And when that's your high point, you can imagine the crowd you'll attract isn't exactly the norm for a \"Grill.\" I'd say that they've misnamed this place -- Its really more like Teakwood's Bar. There's no tavern here, no grill. Just a dive bar full of dirty peanuts and people who couldn't give a hoot about you except to get you in and pour cheap beer down your gullet."}
{"text":"Make no bones about it, there truthfully isn't a whole lot special about this place (in terms of food) but the empty peanut shells coating the ground, the vibe (it's often crowded), and the casual, inviting nature of the place is worth one star on its own.  

Key advice: stick to the wings (excellent) and the burgers (pretty good).  Wander too far off the path and you may not feel the urge to come back.  No, not even with a trail of peanut shells to help you find your way."}
{"text":"The food is really good.. way better than you'd think.  The spicy items are a bit much for my wife, but the rest is great bar food and some really nice dishes you'd expect in a more upscale environment.

Try not to load up on free peanuts because you'll never finish your meal.  The fish tacos are great as is the club sandwich, the apple chicken salad and the burgers.

I love the fish, myself.

It can be too liud, but that makes it easy on kids and the TVs are plentiful."}
{"text":"We checked this place out last Sunday for dinner. It's important to remember this is a bar serving bar food. Their big thing is wings. It's a decent place for a beer and snack, but I wouldn't frequent for a great meal. We ordered the honey BBQ chicken bites (boneless wings) to share and a salad. My son had the cheese crisp. Everyone left satisfied but not wowed or anything. It was ok. It is fun to eat peanuts and toss on floor, but not at expense of waiting long time for mediocre food.  I did enjoy my Blue Moon and onion rings."}
{"text":"I think I would like this place drunk. The staff was nice and helpful. The place felt dirty. But the worst part was my husbands sandwich bun was moldy, it was a couple patches, but enough for someone paying attention to see. This happened a couple of months ago. For a place so busy we were shocked that there was time enough for mold to grow on the bread. My friends love this place and I would love to give it another try, but I'm afraid to."}
{"text":"Teakwoods is a divey-esque bar where you're allowed to make a mess and throw peanut shells on the ground. It's filled with a ridiculous mix of patrons and bar food that seriously steps it up a notch; they even won a Best of Phoenix award for their wings. Don't let that limit the menu for you though... I've tried a bunch of their food and here's what I think:

Hot Wings - great sauces and the wings themselves are cooked perfectly how I like em (crispy outside and chewy in the middle).

Buffalo Chicken Sammich - Like a giant hot wing on a bun! I like the El Heffe sauce, but hold the mayo!

Jack Not Jill Chicken Sammich - Chicken, avocado, jack cheese and bacon. Delicious.

Lavosh - Basically Passover pizza! It's a creative way to make put pizza on the menu without the pizza oven.

Mac & Cheese - Another great entree! I respect a place that does two things to their M&C... 1: They use real cheese and melt it. 2: It's not cut from a friggin' casserole. Teakwoods covers those bases very well.

Candlestick Carver - My first sammich at Teakwoods, and a memorable one. Sliced beef, grilled green chiles and tomatoes, horseradish mayo and provolone on sourdough, with au jus. It's huge.

That all being said, the service has been pretty good each time I've gone, and the whole staff is loaded with different recommendations that have all proven to be good. Lastly, their drink specials are absolutely great (Fri and Sun - pints of Four Peaks are cheaper here than at the Brewery during HH). 

I like Teakwoods a lot. It has become one of my new watering holes, so don't be shy if you check in and happen to see me getting my grub on down the way."}
{"text":"Finally visited this local bar.  Place was busy but not packed full, many empty tables.  Service was ok.  Place was extremely loud, TV's were really loud and so people had to be loud in order to socialize.  My husband had their famous BLT with the fried tomatoes, he said it was ok but probably would not have it again, prefer a traditional BLT.  I had the French dip, it was ok, I have had a lot better at many other places.  Fries were good.  This will not be our local hangout, we have better places to be."}
{"text":"Who wouldn't want to go to a place that cooks up cheese curds and tater tots? My group also managed to eat the pretzel sticks app and the Jess Jess wings. I dunno what's in the Jess Jess sauce, but it's GOOD. 

For my dinner, I got the french dip (with tots, of course). The meat was cooked well, bread was soft, but not too soft, so it stood up against the au jus. And the tots, well, that just brought me back to childhood :) Apparently, it brought my friend back to her childhood too, as I discovered she was eating 'em without telling me. HAHA

All in all, this is a good place to watch a game with your group of friends, on one of the many TVs, in a warm atmosphere (thank you dark wood decor) and eat some good \"bar\" food."}
{"text":"Love the cold beer.  Love the peanuts.  Like the food.  Like the staff.  A better than average local hangout, but there is one issue,  every time I get fries with my order , they taste like fish.  Not sure if it's using the same oil or what. It doesn't happen anywhere else but here.  I'll overlook and get a different side."}
{"text":"My favorite place for lavosh. The chef always changes the lavosh offerings. Had the veg head with chicken...has sauteed spinach, grilled tomatoes and artichokes and grilled chicken smothered in harvarti cheese. Wonderful!  Have also had Jess Jess wings, burgers, sandwiches.... everything is great!"}
{"text":"Teakwoods has the best wings & a great selection of food (and beer) with big portions! We always have great service from a friendly staff!"}
{"text":"really friendly service; they serve four peaks beers, and though inside was very busy and loud, the outdoor seating was lovely.
The bbq chicken lavosh is the -bomb-."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, FANTASTIC SERVICE!  Home eating leftover appl salad & Oh My God!, it's even better than a couple hours ago.  This place knows how to treat its customers! When our drinks didn't live up to expectations, they were replaced without question.  Sarah took great care of us!  We'll be back, with friends . Love my CHS alum!
  Last visit Brittany Joy took AWESOME care of our group.  Even though it's not close to home, we will all be back again, very soon.  AMAZING FOOD, AMAZING SERVICE!"}
{"text":"Jess Jess wings... Actaully, any of their wings are great. Good place to meet after work, throw a few back, and grab some food. Cheese curds are great, plus I love eating peanuts I can throw on the floor!"}
{"text":"Everything I've had here was delicious.  Had the gyro,  gyro salad, and wings. Wings are grilled and crispy just the way we like them. Atmosphere is typical bar and grill, nothing special."}
{"text":"We were seated right away since it wasn't busy but our server didn't come to the table for 10 minutes. Once our order was in the food came out fast but we were missing items that were added to the order. Our server didn't come back for 30 minutes because all her attention was on a party of 6 on the other side of the restaurant. We counted her trip to the other table 13 times before she finally came back to ours. Our food was also bland with no seasoning and our drinks were empty most of the time. We were also charged for the added items that were not received. By the time she finally came back I just wanted to get out and requested my check."}
{"text":"While it's less than a mile away, my first visit to Teakwood's was via an expiring Groupon, and I was pleasantly surprised.

Outside of the Four Peaks taps (one is rotating, which made me very happy), the beer selection is pretty sports bar bland. The food is solid. The service is solid.

What's strange about Teakwoods is the ambiance. At one end, a dreadlocked singer-songwriter was opening for another folky act with an Americana-tinged hipster-y crowd looking on. The music was surprisingly good. Around the bar, there were some gentlemen who appeared addicted to growth hormone and mixed martial arts. At the other end, around the televisions and booths, there was a random assortment of patrons, from families to people just hanging out with a beer and generally watching TV or playing bar trivia. It was probably the oddest mix of customers I'd ever seen in one bar, but I liked it. I really did.

I'll have to run through some of the other entrees and appetizers to get a full grasp of the menu, but Teakwoods has a weird appeal, and I think it'll replace Half Moon as my go-to walking distance sports bar."}
{"text":"Great for those Sundays to watch the games with the family. Seems like a mess with all the peanut shells on the ground but that is just the bars character! Loves this place and amazing wings..."}
{"text":"I was just here and asked for table outside and the hostess showed us to a table. After waiting for twenty minutes with no service we went inside to ask if we could get a server. We waited another ten minutes but no one came out so we left. I've been here multiple times and really enjoy the food but the service has always been sub par. This time was just ridiculous and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"We have been twice in the last 2 weeks. The food is amazing and very reasonably priced. The kids menu has tons of choices and only $5! We have had the same waitress both times we went, she remembered us from our 1st visit. The waitress was on top of things and didn't miss a beat. We will for sure be returning!"}
{"text":"Love this location!  They have a great menu and the food is always tasty.  The Jess-Jess and El Hefe wings are amazing.  Try their happy hour.  The place is great for kids and also has a solid breakfast menu.  Don't wait in line at IHOP.  Get to your nearest Teakwoods!"}
{"text":"Our entire family is sad that this place has come to the end of it's era. We went tonight and had a completely different experience than we've had the past 15 years. Apparently, it has been bought out by someone else. They no longer have curly fries (OMG), the chicken tenders are scrawny, the salads were lackluster, and they don't even have the oreos for the kids anymore. The soda had no carbonation and when I asked about it, they said they checked and it was normal. Completely flat soda. We had years of memories there but that is the end.   :("}
{"text":"I'm not a big sports bar guy, but I wanted to be out with other Packer fans this weekend and I wanted to throw peanuts on the floor, so Teakwoods it is!  We ordered drinks and cheese curds right off the bat, and our curds came before our drinks!!! Waitress was on top of it when we needed another beer and another bucket of peanuts. The menu is a typical bar menu burgers, flatbreads and fried food. Peanuts and cheese curds were enough for us. No complaints here. GO PACKERS!"}
{"text":"Cheap Beer.  Strip Mall Bar.  Big open space and tables.  Tons of small TV's with no sound.

Tasty, greasy bar food.

I came here on a Thursday night.  Beer seemed really cheap... clearly this is a great place to go if you want to drink with friends for not a lot of money.  I had a microbrew bottle special for $2.50, for example, that was delicious.

Because everyone raved about the wings, I tried some (Jess Jess, $9.50 for a dozen).  I felt, like many do, that they are not \"saucy\" enough.  Almost no sauce.  But they are good.  Not great, not otherworldly, and not the best I've had in Phoenix.  But they are good, fair priced, and worth ordering if you are drinking beer and looking for an appetizer.

I ordered the Candlestick Carver, recommended by many.  It was good.  Decent to good cuts of roast beef on sourdough (texas toast like) bread, with melted cheese and roasted peppers.  Here's a hint:  ASK FOR NO MAYO.  I like Mayo, but they put like 5 tablespoons on, and it kind of ruined it, and with the dipping au jus suace, you don't need it.

I finished mine, enjoyed every bite, was stuffed, and ate a few of the curley fries (these are just the cheap frozen premade stuff you find at most restaurants).

My son ate the Mac & Cheese.  I didn't try, but it looked fine.

Anyway, will I be back?  Perhaps.  It's kind of a dive.  Parking is fine.  Serivce was nice.  Beer selection and pricing is the strength of this restaurant.  Food was good for a bar, maybe great.

But this isn't a gastropub.  Not gourmet.  Check those expectations at the bar.

I'd think this is a great place to go with a group of coworkers for happy hour.  Or a guys night out.  It's casual enough for the family if you are looking for greasy food.

Order the wings.  But don't expect best of Phoenix.  Just expect solid wings.

If I was coming here again with just one other person, I'd likely try a different appetizer to share, order a couple of their cheap beers, and probably eat their Buffalo Chicken sandwich to get the flavor of the buffalo wings without all the fatty skin.

And I'd go home a pretty content man after signing the bill."}
{"text":"Always a go to place for food. Like the prime rib sandwich."}
{"text":"Great wings. Unique flavor. They are fried, sauced and then grilled. The Jess Jess are topped with blue cheese crumbles and probably my favorite. Burgers are nice & juicy. 

Happy hour & reverse HH offers pretty good deals on drinks but very limited food items. If they offered their wings (instead of boneless) for a deal during HH, I'd come here more often."}
{"text":"The bartenders make this place! They are just awesome, without interrupting you every 5 minutes!

I also LOVE the tacos and wings!"}
{"text":"Two words.... Adult Milkshake.

They use real ice cream in their milkshakes. My favorite is Oreo cookie with chocolate vodka. I only trust them to make them. And I know how much of a pain in the butt that they are to make. In the time it takes to make one shake they could serve 20 regular tap beverages. I thank you teakwoods.  Whenever I need a treat (and it's only a few times a year) this is it. 

The lavosh is also amazing here. I always pick their daily special. Last one I had was a Tuscan veggie lavosh with white sauce. So yummy, and perfectly portioned when shared.  Oh and the boyfriend and I shared nachos a while back with chili on top. Chili nachos... drool!  I wish I could have treats like this more often, but it is probably a good thing we are only here one every few months. It's not the closest place to us but we always seem to end up here all gross (after moving, yard work, painting, house work etc.) I like that it's casual and really laid back. Free peanuts are the best!"}
{"text":"Great food tasting food, always have a new special with innovating new dishes, beer is very cold and have a great selection of local brews"}
{"text":"Who does not like smashing someone else's nuts and then having them clean up the mess?  This is exactly what you can do at Teakwood's. 

Some bars of pretzels, some have trail mix, but only Teakwood's has buckets of peanuts in the shell. Selling them is part of the fun, Crack em' or smash em' then throw the shells on the floor. That's right the floor, so you can imagine this is not the most elegant place. 

Every night has some drink specials and a decent selection of beers as a good bar should. The food is well executed bar style menu expect to see your cheese laden and fried foods. 

I brought a friend here who had a particularly bad week and day, I did not think anything could cheer her up. After pounding on half a bucket of peanuts, her frustration was gone."}
{"text":"We just had a delicious dinner here! Peanuts on the table to start and specials to peruse as well. 
My husband got the Cajun mahi tacos which he said were excellent. I got the chicken taco salad with grilled chicken and loved the guacamole and jalepeno ranch dressing!  Our daughter got the cheeseburger sliders and shoestring fries-which were eaten so fast I didn't even get a fry! I'll take that as an enthusiastic endorsement too! 
Fun atmosphere, lots of sports on the multiple tv screens, a little loud but very enjoyable overall. Bree,  our server, was great! And the gentleman they had clearing the tables was good too.
We will definitely be back! 
They have good prices, and with a Groupon it was a screaming deal too!"}
{"text":"I'm on a quest to find the best hot wings in Phoenix; so far Teakwoods is at the top of the list - plus you get to chuck peanuts on the floor, and the staff were really friendly and helpful.  Beer was ice cold; can't go wrong with that."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pub-style places.  The food is always really good, and they have some really specials sometimes.  There's a wide variety of wing flavors available, all of them really great.  The lavosh pizza is excellent.  Decent beer selection, good service, and unlimited peanuts in the shell."}
{"text":"I heard the other food is good hear but I'm just here for the wings. Ok, you've got me I've eaten a couple other things off the menu. It's all good!"}
{"text":"Yep, I'm a fan. In fact, I'm such a fan that I made it here twice in one week. I came back the second time before I'd had a chance to review my first visit.

This place is like therapy for me. It just feels wrong to sweep your peanut shells onto the ground. It's quite liberating. I don't normally go to places that \"crunch\" when you walk around. The peanuts are free & are in little buckets on the tables & bar.

There are tv's everywhere! They're usually playing sports.

I haven't been out on the patio yet. I'm not a smoker. From what I've seen it looks like a nice patio.

-- First time I was here was on a Mon. The place was pretty dead, except for the bar. Can be kind of hard to get seats at the bar because of how small it is.

Tim was working & Autumn was training. Very nice people. Tim's quite the comedian at times. He's good at his job. I asked for a drink recommendation. He asked what flavors I like. I told him I like fruity but not overly sweet. He recommended a drink to me that was very similar to what I've ordered before. His was great though. He had me pegged, spot on.

Only thing that was bummer is MGD is NOT a drink special on Mon. That's a misprint :(

-- The second time was very different. Came in on Fri around 8-9ish. Got a booth & ordered food.

I had the Seafood Pasta which was a special for $12.99 if I remember correctly. Olive Garden has a dish that's similar (& usually better). It wasn't humongous. I managed to finish it all & not feel stuffed. The seafood part was delicious. The shrimp, mussels, clams were all tasty. There was one clam that didn't open. Why was it put on my plate? The sauce was lacking though. It was some kind of oily white wine sauce. Could have used more of it on my plate. It just needed more oomph to it. Still not a bad dish, but I've had better. Their strawberry lemonade wasn't too bad. A little watered down though.

There was live music. Fun :) The first band was good. They had a mandolin. Insta-points! They played a Bravery cover & did a good job. More points! The second bad (oops, I accidentally typed \"bad\". Freudian slip?) was meh. Too loud. Too older-gentlemen-trying-to-hold-onto-their-youth-by-being-in-a-garage-band. We left.

Last notes...
Our server was really nice. She joked around with us a little. I liked her :)
Also, the bathrooms are always pretty nice."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Was there with friends last Sunday and the waitress added a little extra to my friends tab.  Not cool.  Not sure we will return."}
{"text":"very kid friendly, great staff, have never had a bad plate of food there."}
{"text":"Best wings in town! I recommend getting a dozen and doing 6 honey hot BBQ and 6 Jess Jess if you like Bleu cheese"}
{"text":"Teakwoods was my go to place when I lived in Biltmore. They have such a diverse menu that those of you that hang with picky eaters would appreciate. They have the usual assortment of yummy burgers and wings. They serve up a ginormous Triple Decker Tavern Club, which is very tasty and you can easily get 2 meals out of it. Last time I went I got French Toast at dinner time, how cool is that. I had left overs for breakfast the next morning. Their meatloaf is delicious as well. And they serve the best Strawberry Lemondade in all of Phoenix which my wife just loves. 

Teakwoods actually get 6 yelp stars from me for serving Diet Dr Pepper. Teakwoods you rock and I miss you; But I'll be back to visit this weekend."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years! Love this place, food is always delicious. Reasonable prices on beer as well."}
{"text":"I went to Teakwoods today for breakfast. I received a text offer to buy a breakfast entree get a second one free. My husband and I have been going to Teakwoods for quite a long time and used to enjoy the food. Not so anymore. We went today and the placed was packed. The waitress after taking our order told us that there would probably be a 35 minute wait. Well, 35 minutes turned into an hour. Well we were forwarded so that was okay. When the food came out my bacon and egg breakfast was missing the bacon. And the potato pancake that was supposed to accompany the bacon and eggs turned into very bland home fries. I had ordered my bacon soft and when we told the waitress that my bacon was missing she returned with almost charcoaled pieces of bacon. By this time I was starving and didn't want to send the bacon back for fear my breakfast would turn into an all day affair. My husband didn't do much better with his breakfast. His breakfast was supposed to come topped with a country gravy and that did not come that way. 
Unfortunately, this wasn't the first time that we were disappointed in a Teakwoods meal. The previous time we had eaten there I had ordered the Jack and Jill. The chicken was extremely dry and tasteless. I did complain to the server and she apologized and told me that the cooks were new and weren't up to speed yet. Well, guess what? They still aren't up to speed."}
{"text":"Teakwoods is awesome and awesome for a variety of reasons.  Aside from the fact that they are huge supporter of my work at Crisis Nursery, their food is so yummy.  I love the pretzels and if anything, you should go in there just for that.  With any entree you have option of getting tater tots.  Tater tots rock!  Be prepared for big portion sizes.  You will definitely be taking a doggy bag home with you.

Also their wait staff is very attentive and they work very quickly.  If you are looking for a place to kick back with friends and family.  This is a great establishment to do that.  Great food, great service, fun atmosphere and peanuts.  Who could ask for anything more?"}
{"text":"Our family has been going to teakwood's since it opened and we always loved the food and service, until yesterday.   The service we received yesterday was beyond awful and bordered on rude.  The waitress was not wearing a name badge nor did she introduce herself.   She was not friendly at all.  We got our drinks and food in a timely manner however that was the only time we saw her again.  No refills, did not ask if everything was ok.  Can I say we watched her serve and refill her other tables....as we finished a busser  removed our plates and empty glasses...the waitress by then walked past us 4x....finally put the check on the table as she kept walking.  I don't think we will be going back"}
{"text":"We always enjoy this place. Good atmosphere and delicious food. Try the pretzels and cheese appetizer so yummy pretzels perfect and cheese sauce is very good. We like the BBQ chicken salad the chicken was moist and tasty. a generous salad and topped with two amazing onion rings. The buffalo chicken tacos are very good too. We always like their burgers as well. Good options for kids meals too at a very reasonable price. The waitresses are always nice and attentive. We love when they run groupon and living social deals as they always worth it. We will continue to come back here."}
{"text":"When we moved to Gilbert in 2004 this was pretty much the only place to go and amazingly good. So good in fact that in 2007 we had them cater a large party. They came up with a menu that fit the theme and the food was excellent. I would have rated them a 5 then.

I'm sad to say that in the last 2-3 years the food has steadily went downhill.  So much so that the only time we go now is when they have pumpkin beer which my wife loves.  So we went again recently and unfortunately it was the same poor quality food that has become their norm. 
With all the good restaurants available in Gilbert this will be our last time here unless they do a major change.

Bottom line....do not waste your time & money here with so many other places that are infinitely better."}
{"text":"The burgers are pretty good here and who doesn't like eating peanut and tossing the shells on the floor. 
Full bar with a patio"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad burger here... 
they haves pretty  big menu  salads, soups, pizza,burgers,wraps,etc
The best part is every table has peanuts to snack on and you toss the shells on the floor you don't have to be a kid to love that."}
{"text":"Stopped in After a Movie Had A Patty Melt & Husband had A Bacon Cheeseburger Very Tasty Good Service Thumbs Up"}
{"text":"I have been to Teakwoods a number of times, and have always been impressed with their food and service. Tonight, however, I was extremely disappointed. It was crowded in a Saturday night, but that is no excuse for the poor service I received. There were two bartenders working, and one of them basically ignored me. She walked past me multiple times as I waited to order food. She then walked past my empty glass multiple times, and was often just standing behind the bar. When I finally received my food, the wings were overcooked and very dry, and they did not get my order right. 
Based on prior visits, I will probably go back, but was very disappointed in this visit. Hopefully next time these issues will have been resolved."}
{"text":"First off, when you walk in it is too bright for a good bar atmosphere. The peanut shells on the floor everywhere remind me of a chain wanna be divey restaurant. Then waitress we had was pretty clueless, but tried to be nice, I guess. All in all, it was a wasted trip to what we thought was going to be a good hang out place."}
{"text":"So I went to Teakwoods last night. I have been patronizing this place since the day it opened. I live within walking distance. Quite frankly, the quality and portions have been  steadily decreasing while they continue to raise prices. A dozen wings is now almost $12.
Last night I went with my GF and son. We ordered 2 dozen wings, an order of french fries for them and I had a small dinner salad. Add a $3 draft beer, a soda and glass of wine.
When the bill came I reviewed the charges and noticed that 2 dozens wing were $28.98!
When I asked the server I was told there was a surcharge ( $3 per dozen = 25%!!) due to an increased cost in chicken wings. There was a notice on the table which I was not told about...This was not shared with me by the server, for which she apologized.
She did tell me this was temporary and they did not want to reprint the menus, because they are hopeful they will be able to rescind the added charge. I am DONE with Teakwoods when it comes to food. I may stop in for a beer, or drink from time to time, but some wings, a salad and a few drinks should not cost almost $60"}
{"text":"Wasn't a huge fan of the menu when my coworkers wanted to go here over a year ago - but now that I have been exploring the wing selection, this place has become my favorite wing stop in town. I usually like honey hot but their Jess Jess is outstanding even if it is a bit on the mild side. On top of the wings, the staff is always friendly and attentive. That combined with plenty of TV's and free peanuts makes for a great all around sports bar."}
{"text":"Service was great. Drinks were a good price but could've been stronger. Food was too dry."}
{"text":"I love their food and their takeout service via Delicious Deliveries is awesome! I've never had a bad meal or experience! I highly recommend Teakwood's!"}
{"text":"New in town, wanted some \"local flare\", was taken here. 
Nice place.  Not crowded. Staff was friendly and eager to help. I wanted a beer and could not decide on the types on the menu.  She asked me what i normally drink and brought me a sample.  She knew her stuff the choice was perfect.  took it.  I went simple.  Cheese burger sliders & skinny fries while the table had wings.  Liked all of it.  Wasnt loud or obnoxiously busy like these places can be.  But im sure it is a fun place to be for a good game!.  Id go back and try more things on the menu next time im in town sure!  

On a much more personal note... i didnt give 5 stars because I, me personally, dont care for the peanuts on the floor.  I loved the peanuts.  Just not on the floor.  Not my thing.  
Id still come back.  
Thank you for a great experience Teakwoods."}
{"text":"Good wings and nice sauces. You can eat peanuts for free unlimited. It's a nice spot but it's kinda greasy sometimes."}
{"text":"Sports bars are loud, yes. But it was so loud you can't hear the person across the table from you. Everyone is semi yelling resulting in a cacophony of voices, dishes banging and the jarring realization you're not going to carry on a conversation. The food was a little pricey. Decent portion but a pet peeve buns that are not warm, buns that fall apart. Similar to what happens when you freeze them 2 burgers 2 iced teas and $37 plus tip later, big disappointment. Staff was friendly / hence the extra star."}
{"text":"Ok, y'all, I'm gonna be perfectly honest, I've never set foot in Teakwoods for even one minute. I HAVE, however, ordered food from them via DoorDash. Their buffalo chicken fingers have won awards for a reason - they are very VERY good. Not just good, they're phenomenal. Couple them with some ranch and garnish with a carrot, and you have one of the best dinners in the valley of the sun. I couldn't tell you where Teakwoods is, and maybe some time I'll pay it a visit, but until then I will be perfectly happy having their chicken fingers delivered to my house."}
{"text":"Decent food and overall nice atmosphere. At this point, my main suggestion would be to train your servers. Our waitress was super nice, but also had ZERO knowledge about the menu... including the soup of the day. We blindly ordered as all she would say when asked a questions was... \"it's a popular item\" OR \"people tend to like it\"... cool, but I want a more in-depth description.

Do you inform the staff of the daily specials? Let them test it out? 

That is all :). Thanks!"}
{"text":"Great wings, burgers. All Current sports on many tvs spread evenly through the restaurant."}
{"text":"Potato Lovers Unite!!! 

Sandwiches come with your choice of steak fries, string fries, curly seasoned fries, or tater tots. YUM! There's some other options, but I want fried spuds when I go to a sports bar. I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak, and it was huge!!! Food was good, and service was fast. 

Only one drawback: They charged me an extra 50 cents for a side of ranch. Really? Boo."}
{"text":"I had to speak up when I saw the negative reviews this place got for the shooting. Totally unfair. And I wouldn't say that if this place were in any way shady or even mediocre.

I've come here with various groups of friends many times over the years. I've met my lawyer buddies here. I had a friend who worked at Intel and I met her and her Intel buddies here (Intel is actually close by so you'll often run into Intel folks). The typical crowd here is the exact opposite of what comes with the stigma of a freak shooting incident like this. 

It gets five stars from me because it delivers on all accounts: good service, good beer specials, good food, and most importantly just a great place to kick back after a long day's work with friends and just have a good time. 

Ray and Kyrene is not a bad part of town, folks. Freak shootings can happen anywhere and everywhere. If you're scared of coming here you should definitely stay far far away from downtown Phoenix, Mill Avenue, and every well-known Scottsdale nightclub. Loren Wade anyone?"}
{"text":"I come to this location ALOT because I liked the food and service but for a while the service has been going downhill and my last 3 times have been very disappointing.  I always go for dinner and usually after the happy hour is over so it's not that crowded but service is always lacking.  

We had a different server each of the last 3 times we went and all of them need to learn the basics because they didn't have a clue.  Our drinks would usually take about 15 minutes to make it to us and our food orders were wrong for 2 out of 3 people at our table.  I had to ask for a side of ranch 3 times before it finally showed up and by that time, about 15 minutes, my food was cold and the other 2 people that were seated with me had finished their food.  

Finally we decided to leave and asked for our bills.  It took 4 tries before she got the bills correct.  Each time she would put someones food with another persons drinks and totals were off.  We kept repeating what each of us had ordered but she would just interrupt and say that she knew what it was and would fix it.  Four tries later she got it right.  Believe it or not, no exaggeration, it took us about 25 minutes to pay the bill because she kept making mistakes.  

On a good note the food is usually very good, I like the peanuts at the table, and it's a great place to watch the games.  I feel that the management in this place needs to pay more attention to what is going on. The prices I've noticed have gone up but the quality of service has definitely gone down.  I think I'm gonna give Teakwoods a break for a while and see what other sports bars in the area have to offer.  Time to start searching Yelp for a new spot :)"}
{"text":"We ended up walking out!!! We were the first of 3 tables sat outside and 10 mins later a girl came out took the other tables drink order and goes inside. About 10 mins later a guy comes out and takes our drink order. 10 mins after that he just leaves the tea no sugar and says he'll be right back to take the order we waited another 20 mins no sight of him. Normally I would wait and talk to a manager but I had my 2 year old son after waiting 45 mins there was no way he would have sat still without food for however long it would take a manager to get To us! One star cause the hostess who sat us was sweet."}
{"text":"Went to Teakwoods for the first time tonight and will definitely be back. We started with the wings in El Hefe and Jess Jess, and they were honestly the best wings I've ever had. The flavor was incredible, the meat was quality, and they were just perfect overall. 

For our main course, my dining companion got the Carver- basically a French dip with green chiles and horseradish mayo. It was perfect and I had serious food envy. I had the veg head lavosh, which was really good and had a ton of artichoke hearts (always a positive). 

The service was great. Everyone from the manager to the food runner was friendly, and our server was particularly good. 

I loved the vibe of this place, and the food is top-notch. Will definitely be back and plan to eat my body weight in wings."}
{"text":"This place is great.  The fish and chips and fish tacos are phenomenal.  I also love their BBQ wings grilled.  Beer is good, service is great, and all the peanuts you can eat.  The patio is great to sit at when the weather cools down and this is a great spot if your a football fan.  I highly recommend this place/"}
{"text":"Fun place to hang out after watching my son play softball.  Love that you can  eat peanuts and throw the shells on the floor.  It's crunchy and messy looking but it's a funky divey bar.

The sandwiches looked good and the wings my son had were extremely hot.  The celery I ate was crunchy.  The funny thing here is the lime you put in the beer is cut too big and it's hard to push it in the bottle without without squirting everyone around you.

It was a fun evening.  Enjoyed the company . I needed nothing more."}
{"text":"First off very friendly staff and good service. But my order was messed up and I had to wait a long time for my replacement meal. The wings are okay, I've had better at so many different places lol. The atmosphere is nice and it's very spacious. However I think I may have gotten sick from here, because my stomach hurts like hell and I didn't even finish my burger."}
{"text":"I crave the loaded potato skins and beef tip onion soup. Great wings too. 
 Always courteous and welcoming."}
{"text":"Always impressed with the service, food, and variety.  They win!"}
{"text":"Great el jefe wings!

The blonde waitress was polite, the burger was good, the Tex mex salad was good too.

The highlight of this meal was the el jefe chicken wings though.

Decent spot to get a bite to eat with some friends."}
{"text":"I find myself at Teakwoods a lot. I constantly have Groupons from this place and they make it well worth it. Teakwoods is a fairly typical Sports Bar with peanut shells on the floor and live music Fri / Sat nights. They also offer free UFC fights and have some amazing daily drink specials.

Food & Drinks - 3/5
Decent food, wings are pretty good, not the best like everyone raves but certainly good. My favorite thing to order here is breakfast, its available anytime and always hits the spot on a sunday morning.

Service - 3/5
Good service, never had any complaints.

Atmosphere - 3/5
Casual, lots of TV's, a stage with a few couches and a fairly large patio.

Price - 4/5
Food is average but the drink specials are really good.

Overall - great causal place to grab a bite to eat and catch a game with friends... or alone."}
{"text":"Mediocre food,  disgusting surroundings, intolerable noise levels. 

If you're looking for a place to bring your screaming kids where they can literally throw their food on the ground and no one cares then I guess this is the spot for you. I'm astonished that the reviews for this place are so positive and that more people don't mention how nasty the floors are.  Enjoy kicking your way through a sea of discarded peanut shells; I pity the soul that wears open-toed shoes like I made the mistake of doing.

My husband had the patty melt, I had the barbecue chicken lavosh, and my daughter had the macaroni and cheese. The food was mediocre at best. 

For some reason unimaginable to me this place was incredibly packed at six O clock on a Thursday night. I could hardly hear myself think let alone make out the words from my husband's mouth who was sitting across the table.

The only reason I did not give this place one star is because the waitress was competent and kind. 

Due to the poor quality food and terrible atmosphere,  I will never return here."}
{"text":"This is a local bar that I can walk to from my house, so I end up here probably more than I should.  The food is fine for bar food, but over priced.  The drinks are fine and they have decent specials during happy hour."}
{"text":"Slow service and cold food even ran out of sweat potato fries and never got replacement order. Manager went out of her way to apologize but by then we were very very disappointed. Service was very slow even though it didn't seem to busy."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love throwing peanut shells on the floor? Not to mention for \"bar food\" this place takes it up a notch. Most recently, I enjoyed a green chile cheese burger which was ginormous! Already a fan of the ruben and the cheesesteak. Plenty of drink specials and TVs for watching games. On my last visit, I noticed they offer live music on weekends. Will have to keep an eye on that..."}
{"text":"Worst place ever!!!!! We have a regular group that comes here EVERY  week!! Tonight after they let us order $300 in food with a large group she informed us that we are not welcome!! The food was cold, the service sucked, the manager is a Very mean person!!! I would never come back to this place again!! It rarely has business and I hope it goes out of business! If the owner actually reads this fire the person that provides your customer service!!!The server told us to F @*?k off"}
{"text":"We get seated immediately, there are peanuts to snack on while you wait. Service is normally swift unless there is a large group in the same section as you. We eat there maybe once a month. I really like the burgers and the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"I really like teakwoods the food is good.  It's comfortable and they have the best Philly cheesesteak around now I'm not from Philly but it sure taste good I don't care where you're from prices aren't bad either"}
{"text":"When Teakwoods has enough staff on hand, this place ROCKS!  The food is always excellent. Tonight was a winner. Awesome salad, awesome burger, and attentive waitstaff. :)"}
{"text":"Great place! Somethings a bit loud inside but overall good food and good service. Sometimes it gets busy and can be a wait for a table. Have always enjoyed hanging out at Teakwood's in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"The bartenders here are awesome!  How do you know?  They've been here FOREVER! 

The beer selection isn't worth mentioning but luckily the gals behind the bar have a heavy pour on your favorite cocktail.  The food is good, typical bar fare."}
{"text":"Very pleased with this place! The host was sassy and rolled his eyes when we asked for coloring books. But aside from that our servers were amazing. They frequently checked up on us and were incredibly friendly. I love the atmosphere and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Teakwoods is a pretty typical example of a local sports grill. There are lots of TVs, it's loud, there are peanut shells on the floor and a bunch of beers on draft. While the regular menu seemed a little limited, they did have several specials that sounded good. I had the special wood-grilled salmon on a bed of salad which was perfectly cooked, not dry, and very flavorful.  The glaze was very light and not too sweet.  My son had the kids chicken strips and fries. I thought his portion was a little small (he is only 3 and ate the whole thing) but his fries were excellent - thin & crispy.  

Teakwoods lost points this visit for sitting us right next to the kitchen entrance at a very wobbly table and the tables also seemed too close together.  Next time I'd like to try the outside patio where the tables have more space.  The service was pretty good for most of the meal but it took forever to get our check at the end.  It WAS busy, but 10 minutes is a little too long in my opinion.

I will likely try Teakwoods again because it's kid-friendly and close to my house, but I wouldn't drive out of my way to get here."}
{"text":"Just a warning (because I don't see this info anywhere on their website) they have peanuts all over the place. We walked in and then right back out because our son has a life threatening peanut allergy. We were bummed cause they looked really good!"}
{"text":"If only...Teakwoods at this W. Ray location would get 5 stars if only they could do a few more little things to make their service perfect, because their food already is! 

Yesterday's visit with my hubby at 3:30 p.m. (on a Saturday) - we were one of only two tables occupied in the restaurant side. The bar side was hopping and noisy! We felt a little ignored because the wait staff was so focused on the bar side. When we were served, we immediately asked for tartar and BBQ sauces, and by the time we asked a second time (the first guy forgot us completely), our food was almost cold. But still great. They switched our plates - hubby got the well-done, I got the medium-well burger, and it was too late by the time we realized it to switch back (after the condiments were on). Ugh. 

If we were served by the same person who waited on us, these mistakes wouldn't have happened - it's the result of having 2-3 people coming to our table. Plus they charge extra for tartar and BBQ - .50 each. Really? I've never had this happen at any other restaurant. 

But this is still one of our very favorite local places!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this spot! Great drinks, delicious food! They no longer have live music, which is a bummer but other than that, it's great!"}
{"text":"Updated 2017

Rarely do this... but dropping my rating to three stars.  It was very slow and service was poor.  Also, there is a \"wing surcharge\".  I asked what that meant and received minimal explanation.  Is there a chicken shortage?  So sad when good places go downhill!

Original 2015 

Best wings in Phoenix without question.  I recommend El Heffe or Jess Jess grilled.  They also have really good daily specials so check those out too!"}
{"text":"Teaks prides itself on not being the \"pub grub\" kind of place. Well, that and serving a beer called Moose Drool, which I hear has real moose saliva!

Anyway, you gotta love a place where there's peanuts in the shell on every table and you can order breakfast any time of day...or night.

How many sports bars serve breakfast anyway?

Despite the numerous plasma/LCD televisions, sometimes Teaks gives off more of a family restaurant vibe than that of a sports bar.

There are a lot of little kids in there on days and nights and it seems to be a popular post-game venue for parents following Corona del Sol home games. 

Food is good, portions are large and the variety is awesome. That alone will bring in people of any age. 

One thing I cannot understand is why, with so many great televisions, the place would rather play the stereo than put the volume on when there are games on.

During an NFL game recently it took them about a quarter to get the volume restored on the second half of the Giants/Eagles game (rather than switching to the local feed) and on one busy college football Saturday a spaghetti western popped on one screen.

Still, I can live with Sergio Leone, football and eggs."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Zipps in Ahwatukee and waited over 30 minutes to even put in an app order. The server never came over so we left and came to Teakwoods... with every table full; we were sat at a booth, the waiter came within 1 minute, we ordered our drinks and received them within 6 minutes, ordered food and the food came out within 14 minutes... all in all we waited I've 30 minutes at Zipps just to walkout and leave because no one paid attention to us. Within 21 minutes of being at Teakwoods we had our drinks and food... we were delighted to be somewhere that cared. 

 The wings were outstanding, the server had such a polite disposition, the area was a little load, the other servers were walking around with smiles on their faces and even checked in with us to make sure we didn't need anything. If the servers expressed the same teamwork at Zipps, I'm sure that Zipps would have been as busy as Teakwoods. Oh!!! And I can't forgot!! Teakwoods had my favorite beer HOPKNOT!! And it was chilled to the bones and tasted perfect."}
{"text":"This used to be our go-to place for chicken wings & pretzels. However, they have messed up our order more than once on the wings & we have since discovered The Tavern Grill in Scottsdale. 
I am a big fan of ranch dressing but the ranch at Teakwoods is just not good. For good ranch I go to The Tavern Grill or Long Wong's or IHOP or The Chuckbox.
Once we ordered extra carrots & celery with the order of wings & ended up with 4 of each instead of 2 of each (for an extra charge).
The drinks are HUGE which is good so you don't have to worry about getting a refill but sometimes we don't drink very much so we end up wasting a lot of soda. 
There are MULTIPLE televisions everywhere you look & a jukebox which you can pay to play. There is also a golfing video game.
There are complimentary peanuts on the table but one afternoon I noticed birds pecking at them on the outdoor tables so I am bit iffy on whether I would eat them.
The booths are quite large, easily fitting 6 people comfortably which is good for big families.
Overall, the price is a bit more than I'd like to pay for the food you get. 
The pretzel with cheese is our favorite thing on the menu."}
{"text":"I went to Teakwoods this evening with my parents (who live down the street and LOVE this place). We had spent the day at the pool and didn't want to cook, and Teakwoods is the perfect place to pop in and not worry that you're wearing a bathing suit and no makeup. 

I really like the atmosphere of this place- it's very versatile. I came here while attending ASU and it was a great place for beer and wings on the cheap. But its also a great place for a casual dinner and they have pretty damn good food for a bar with peanuts on the ground. 

I had the Chicken Jack sandwich, which I always get, and it was good. The sweet potato fries I had with it very overwhelmingly spicy, which I didn't like, but I'm sure some people do. Both my parents had burgers and liked them as well. We also had bloody mary's, since they are on special on Sundays. They were fine, but nothing spectacular. I should have stuck to beer in a place like Teakwoods."}
{"text":"Teakwoods is a great place. Decent food, cheap prices, and nice staff. Plus! you have to love the free bucket of peanuts on every table. I often find myself wondering how and why I have eaten so many peanuts, but still continue to crack more and place them into my mouth. Tuesdays are my favorite day because it is wing night. Wings are both cheap and delicious."}
{"text":"Always a good meal here! I love that they have daily specials for drinks and food. Great fries!

Good portions and they have peanuts at the table! 

4 stars cause usually the food is kind of salty for us."}
{"text":"I've never actually eaten in the restaurant. The hubby and I order from here once a week and have it delivered via Delicious Deliveries. 

We've tried numerous things on the menu and everything is wonderful and exactly what you would except from a Tavern. Its good, simple food that hits the spot. They are one of the few places that offer numerous types of French fries and each type of fries are really yummy. My favorite is the sweet potato fries and not every place offers those. My husband loves the club! I have taken a bite or two of the club myself and its high quality lunchmeat. I also really enjoy the chicken mac mac. 

This is definitely a great place!"}
{"text":"Yummy food, good beer, tasty peanuts to snack on, and lots of football on tv. Very good place to take the family but still have some \"adult\" fun."}
{"text":"The wings were really good and the drink specials are great. However the restaurant was extremely loud and I cut my leg on a tear in the bench. 
We would go back for there happy hour to try some other items but not dinner again."}
{"text":"I used to go here to play No Limit Hold 'Em.  When that was eventually ousted from their roster, I never really found a reason to go back.  Its a prototypical generic bar filled with generic people eating generic protein legumes ... but the fact that you can throw those peanut shells on the floor without a care seems to make the Burbans feel super.  

Decent bottled beer selection for average prices.  I'm going to fall asleep writing th i s    r   e    v      i   . . . . ."}
{"text":"The wings here are awesome.  This is a fun place to take kids, too.  Very casual and loud."}
{"text":"Crashed a birthday party that was at Teakwoods. Overall I'm not thoroughly impressed with this place mostly because it was dirty and chaotic. But also because I think this restaurant is trying reach too many niches. When I walk in all I see are parts of other restaurants: Islands, the Sand Bar, Buffalo Wild Wings, Texas/Logan's Roadhouse, and arcade games from Red Robins. 

All I have to say is: PICK A THEME AND RUN WITH IT!! Teakwoods has no culture, no ambiance, nothing that really strikes me with any appeal. The wings were okay, but I've had better. The Greek Salad was actually the best thing I tried, it had good flavor and the perfect amount of dressing and came with pita bread triangles (love it). But the burger I ordered needed more flavor...the service was really really slow, but our waitress was really nice and it was a birthday party so I'll let the slow service slide a little because she was putting in a lot of orders at the same time. 

This place is A-OK!"}
{"text":"What to say. Our waitress was so incredibly rude.  If my food wasn't good then I would give have given it one star. This was my first and last time going there. There is another bar/grill a few doors down that is so much better and less expensive. The only good thing about this place is that there are vegetarian items on the menu."}
{"text":"Awesome food. And great service. I got the honey hot BBQ wings and couldn't handle it. They swamped it out for the honey BBQ for free. Way to run a business!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time... 100s of times when I lived here. It's still a fantastic place to get a sandwich or have a beer. All the chicken sandwiches are fantastic... As is the rest of the menu. Peanuts on the table while you wait are a great bonus. The candlestick carver is still my favorite."}
{"text":"Teakwoods has an excellent menu. I had a BLT sandwich with breaded tomatoes... yum!!! ^^ Also watched the Suns own the Raptors. I like this place. Chill atmosphere, friendly staff, awesome bar-food menu and TVs EVERYWHERE! except in the bathrooms. Plan on going back, it's my new sports bar."}
{"text":"We had guests from out of town in for the weekend and went to Teakwood's. our waitress was Bre, she is friendly, professional and would check in with us to see how the food and drinks were along with asking if we needed anything else. We all had wings, The BEST Wings we have had in the PHX valley!! I like the EL Hefei, the other favorite at the table was the Jess Jess flavor of wings. With prices that are reasonable and the great customer service from Bre along with the awesome wings and drinks, I highly recommend checking out Teakwood's!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I have always liked Teakwoods for many reasons.  You can't go wrong with a place that serves shelled peanuts.  I love that little salty snack before a meal while I'm enjoying a cold beer.  They have great drink and food specials everyday and a specialty beer that is always a good price.  We love the nachos because they are absolutely loaded!  Teakwoods is a great place to watch a game because there are TV's everywhere you look.  I would love if they offered more craft beer because the selection is limited."}
{"text":"What happened with the wings?  I've been a regular patron of Teakwoods for years and really enjoy all the food my wife and I have had here.  The best aspect of this place, as a certified wing \"junkie\" are the Jess Jess and El Jefe wings, which are among the best in the Valley.

The recent $3.00 surcharge on a dozen wings was explained in a placard with our menu.  Apparently, they're having supplier price increases and are passing along the increase to customers.  All well and good, but $3.00 for a dozen costing $11.49?  And to top it off, these were much smaller than the usual excellent wings Teakwoods offers.  Something doesn't add up.  

I eat wings at a lot of the local joints, and none have reported this issue.  While I'm not above paying more for quality, I have a problem with a 26% surcharge for miniature wings compared to the former product.  I'll eat elsewhere until this is straightened out.  Find a new supplier or remove this item from the menu.  It's gouging."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write a review for some time now.  Many years ago we used to frequent Teakwoods.  This is the first time we have been back in years.  We ordered the wings and when we got the bill they were more expensive than on the menu.  The waitress explained that there was an insert in the menu explaining a new \"upcharge\" because chicken prices are so high right now... Seriously? I have never heard such a thing.  In addition, they have allowed the place to become run down.  The booths are lumpy and have duct tape everywhere.  You can visibly see dust/dirt/cobwebs in areas around the place.  Super tacky.  In an time where there is more competition than ever for your food dollars that will not get it done.  The food was \"ok\".  Not great.  Just \"ok\".  My bill for some wings cokes and zucchini was nearly $40..   I will never return."}
{"text":"Teakwood's is one of my favorite places in Gilbert! The beer selection is always good and they show different sports/games on different TVs. There is always good people watching at the bar and if you sign up for their email and text alerts you get great coupons like two for one meals and half off drinks. Some of my favorites are the Buffalo Chicken Wrap and the Crispy Chicken Salad....but the best menu item is an appetizer... The Cheese curds are BOMB!!! They are served with jalapeño ranch that is not spicy but adds an awesome flavor to an already awesome appetizer!"}
{"text":"For years we have been coming here and the customer service we received from the manager was beyond unprofessional.  I have never in my life been spoken to, the way this woman spoke to me.  I understand that not every customer is a peach, but when you go to a restaurant you expect decent food and service. I guess the valid complaints of rude service or cold food exceeded our welcome. So very disappointed in this establishment."}
{"text":"Wow super yum! I was taken off guard by the food here. Had to wait a bit longer then expected and I was getting hangry, but when it arrived those feelings were quickly wiped away! We shared the mild wings, and asked for them to be \"finished on the grill\" (wow the flavor!), then had the weekend special of bbq chicken tacos and chopped wedge salad. Took 2 tacos home, but they were a delightful flavor profile! Wedge salad was even great! Awesome job, keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Teakwoods has been the steadfast champion of my neighborhood tavern needs for decades. Darcie and I met friends there a couple days ago. I have never had a bad experience at the Gilbert or Chandler locations. So many awesome memories. Teaks has done me right for 20+ years. What are you waiting for? Stop in, grab some peanuts from the barrel as you pass by, order a drink, and have fun.

The staff has always been attentive, hard working. and fun.

The wings are indeed among the best in the valley and always have been. Years ago, someone told me they use the same recipe as Long Wongs, but I've only heard that from one source and it's never been confirmed. But they ARE extremely good. No need to order them extra crispy. Teakwoods understands the importance of wing texture. They will NOT serve you rubbery squishy wings. 

The burgers are tasty and they arrive as ordered. Meat cooked to order is dicey aspect of pub/sports-bar dining. Most establishments will bring you a well-done burger not matter your doneness preference or specification, not so at Teakwoods. And that's an endearing and special thing. There's just nothing like a juicy Teakwoods burger.

Can't go wrong with:
  Burgers, wings, Pretzel Sticks, Lavash, Chicken Apple Salad (w/cucumber dressing)

Not a fan of:
  French dip (tough meat), Chicken strips (far too much breading)

Our standard order has evolved to:
  1 dozen Medium Wings with a side of hot sauce
  An order of pretzel sticks with mustard and cheese
  The chuck burger - medium with shoestring fries
  A side salad with Italian

Grab a galvanized tin of peanuts and start you own history at Teakwoods."}
{"text":"Teakwoods is the place to go if you are a \"wings\" fan!  They grill wings for crisp perfection and the flavor is so good that I don't even need ranch to dip the wing in.  I know - How can you not need ranch?  I didn't believe it until I tried it.  

Everytime I go to a restaurant that offers wings, I will be comparing it to Teakwoods."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for happy hour one evening at 5 pm on a Friday and it was packed.  The place is split into 2 rooms and a patio.  We met a few friends in the back of one of the rooms.  We noticed there were peanut shells on the floor...cool, it's one of those places.

Since they were so busy it took a long time to get our order placed.  We had to flag down a server to get her attention.  Since we didn't want to wait twice, we ordered our Beer and food at the same time.  We browsed the menu and decided to order:

Nachos, $10.99

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/teakwoods-tavern-and-grill-chandler?select=AqTkhQINOjPqzCu6D0Xrqw#AqTkhQINOjPqzCu6D0Xrqw

Philly Cheesesteak, $10.99
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/teakwoods-tavern-and-grill-chandler?select=xeOWkFF0VogD-h3tJYsJ0g#xeOWkFF0VogD-h3tJYsJ0g

The Nachos were huge, enough for 2 people.  They were good and had decent flavor.  The Guac and Sour Cream come in small cups so you have to dip your Chips in them or take a knife to put on your Chips....I don't prefer to eat my Nachos that way.

The Philly Cheesesteak was pretty good too....far from the best I've ever had, but decent.

There were plenty of TV's in the restaurant, so we were able to keep apprised of the hockey/football games on the tube.

We had to flag down the server for refills of the Beer....that was the one downside to the visit was the service.  Perhaps we caught them on a short-handed night?  I dunno....

Return Factor - 50%"}
{"text":"The wings are off the handle, especially grilled!  We love this place!"}
{"text":"I normally wouldn't consider a tavern as a place to take my toddler, but there was a good Groupon deal and we were hungry so we took the bait. They had typical pub food: burgers, Cobb salads, fried foods and the like. Prices seemed a little high but with the Groupon the prices are probably lower than your average bar. 

For those with kids: they give real Crayola crayons! Yup. You heard me right. If you don't have kids you'll never understand the frustration on your kids face when you give them the cheap waxy crayons most restaurants hand out. Otherwise service and food were just slightly above average. But the Crayola crayons deserve a solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Teakwoods has the cozy neighborhood bar and grill atmosphere that hubby and I enjoy.  The wings and fries are wonderful, the turkey club is large enough for two and delicious.  It comes with fries and is impossible for one person to finish.  The burgers are great too and again, very large with many variations.  Actually, we've been happy with everything we've tried.  The service is fast and friendly, the atmosphere noisy and convivial the prices are affordable."}
{"text":"My brochacho and I decided to watch the Sunday Night Football game here, since it came highly recommended. Peanuts are available on all tables, and you may channel your inner savage by discarding the shells on the floor. The bar feels a bit dank because of these said shells. 

I was intrigued by the \"Specialties\" portion of the menu and decided to order a French Dip sandwich. Unfortunately there was nothing special about the sandwich other than the fact it was especially bad. It also was obvious that the fries had been sitting for a while. That being said, the drink specials are awesome - definitely cannot beat a $6 pitcher! They have a few other beverages on their drink-special menu as well.

If you are looking to watch a game and drink beer, I would recommend this place. I hope the other options on their menu are better than my sandwich! Order at your own discretion."}
{"text":"If you  walk in knowing that this is a \"bar food\" restaurant you may enjoy it. When I 1st called to get a seat ahead the bartender who answered the phone said \"you should be ok\". I said please put us down we have small children. He sighed and said \"whats your name\"  I then said whats your name\"  He said Brad I'm the bartender.  We were comparing it to the Teakwoods that closed down in our town :(. We were disappointed to say the least. I ordered a burger \"medium rare\" the burger was cooked \"rare\". My husband and I both had an  upset stomache after eating here. I'm rating it a 2 because our server was good (still took care of him), & our kids had fun with the laid back atmosphere with throwing peanut shells. It's too bad the food and attitude from the \"bar tender\" didn't sit well with us ."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre. Menu is intriguing because it's definitely a twist on your average bar food, but the three times I've tried it, dishes were bland and boring. Not bad, just boring."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service consistently!  A family favorite.  Love the huge waters and drinks.  Love the large kids menu selections and specials menu is always a hit!"}
{"text":"we went for early dinner on Monday around 5.  Service was good and the food was good.   prices are a little higher than red robin type places for burgers. we had wings, Burger, Diego Mac and cheese and it was all good.
Great outdoor area with heaters.
Place seemed a little dark and loud...had MANY tv's which was good, but then music blaring above all...
Service was very attentive and tab was $36+ tip of $8 for 2 entree's, appetizer, and 2 sodas.
we'll be back.

Disclaimer: I worked here many years ago when they had live bands.."}
{"text":"Solid food and service. Better set up than the other one but def a lot louder. El Jefe wings are the best around."}
{"text":"Teakwoods is part of our regular rotation. Sometimes, you just want some bar food, and few places I've been to serve it up as well as they do here.

Whether it's wings, a burger or my wife's favorite buffalo chicken sandwich, we've been consistently able to count on a quality meal from this place.

Even though we generally get our orders to go, we have made the time on occasion to dine in and have always been happy with the atmosphere and service. 

This is your neighborhood bar, not some place that the socialites frequent as part of their weekend bar hopping routine and that is just fine with me. There are plenty of other places to go if you're more interested in the crowd than the bar. 

Teakwoods is the place to go when you want something cold on tap, peanuts on the floor, some good wings and an hour or two just hanging out with good friends."}
{"text":"Teakwoods \"touch em all\" is the best burger ever! Terrific wings too."}
{"text":"I gave them a 4 star for their great wings. Our waitress was excellent and was sympathetic about a soggy BLT. We're definitely coming back. I want more pretzel bread to soak up the wing sauce."}
{"text":"Please note that this place should get 3 1/2 stars.

The food is very good here.  I find it way better than typical bar fare.  Their menu is better than good fo sho.  Good place to watch a game and throw peanuts around.  It is priced very well too. 

 I would actually like this place alot more, but I always get a waitor instead of a waitress! I love waitresses and I love talking to them and having fun with them.  It completes my dining experience. (GO Ahead and make fun all you want)  Waitors are just not my thing.  If you are going to have a guy in a place like this put him behind the bar and let him make a stiff drink.  Leave the waitressing to the ladies."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and the service and food is above average unfortunately this last time our server Jordan left her brain at home had ordered Root Beer for my daughter but didn't receive it so we ordered it again but still didn't receive the root beer so my husband went up to the bar and an the old blonde lady was eating candy and ignoring my husband!! So then he went up to our original server (Jordan) and asked her to close our tab and was a little rude about it and as obvious as it is she got no tip!"}
{"text":"Let's just say I'd rather eat at the auto zone across the parking lot. At least there you expect the grease. 

Ordered the \"Wisconsin\" cheese curds. Being a girl from Wisconsin, these are NOT Wisconsin cheese curds. I need a shower after eating them. 

The BLT was burnt, nasty, and the steak fries were soggy. The carvard was soggy and had NO flavor. Thank god we had a Groupon. They should be giving away the food for free. Even the servers look at you like, \"you sure you want to eat here?\"

I gave it two stars because our server was nice, panicked, but nice and the other star for the best part of the meal: peanuts."}
{"text":"The honey BBQ hot flavored wings are the best I have ever eaten. I only come for the wings so I can't speak for anything else they serve. My wife and kids say the food is delicious. The place is really loud but not to the point that it's uncomfortable. The price of food for the quality you get is unparalleled. You have to try this place."}
{"text":"Came here after a late night at work for some food. Even though we ordered everything at 930 everything was PERFECT. MITCHELL was very friendly and fast with our orders. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Biggest chicken wings in Chandler! My friends and I love it here. The service has always been awesome, the food is so good. The surprising thing is the breakfast! Their breakfast sandwich is huge, with REAL eggs and thick cut BACON! Neiborhood bar everyone needs to know about."}
{"text":"Teakwoods exceeded my expectations today. I had never been there before today but I have heard great things. First, our waitress was amazing but I forgot her name (sorry). Very attentive, never had to ask for anything. The food portions are huge , I got chicken tenders and there was about 10 tenders included. Enough for 3 meals. My son got boneless wings and counted 25 chicken pieces. Great food and you get plenty of food for your money !!"}
{"text":"This place is seriously awesome. You get a bucket of peanuts to start (feel free to throw the shells on the floor) and the service is super friendly. Maybe because he was our friend, but I think they're friendly with other people too. We had the soft pretzel appetizer and my mouth just started watering just from typing that. So delicious. i had a chicken sandwich that was decent - a bit big and overwhelming for my taste but definitely tasted great. But the drinks - mmm. They had a whipped cream flavored vodka and put that in rootbeer to make the most amazing \"root beer float\" ever. Loved it. I also really like places that have cute specials for every day of the week, I like that feel of a place that you could go several times in a week and have a good time every time. If you're looking for a chill place to eat, hang out, have a few drinks this should be on your list."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks, and customer service. Aside from them running out of shoestring fries more than a few times, my husband and I love this place!"}
{"text":"Within minutes of being here, I felt at home. Strange, I know. I relocated from Chicago recently and this reminded me of the bar and grills I liked to dine in there. Buckets of peanuts on the table. Throw the shells on the floor! Great menu. I was easily torn between 4 sandwiches and asked for advice from our lovely server who steered me towards the Jack, not Jill sandwich. It was a deliciously grilled chicken breast with jack cheese, bacon, avocado and lettuce. It was delicious! Enough to cut in half and take home for later. The curly fries were slightly overdone. There are a lot of sides to choose from so I'll just try another next time. Onion rings and mozzarella  wrappers were awesome! Pretty pumped to bring friends here when they visit and try more of the yummy sandwich options! Oh, and wings! Yum!"}
{"text":"Been a fan of this building for quite some time.... Seen a fantastic Vine Tavern grow up here. After that came Mckenna's, which was a FAIL. Redemption came with Teakwood's Tavern, as long as you do your homework on which drink specials are avail.  I especially like Friday's special, 2.50 four peaks kiltlifter and 8th st ale.  Food menu is rather nice as well. Awesome decor as well and very comfortable lounge couch's inside and out. and free peanuts just throw them on the ground which is kinda fun ha ha. 

If in doubt, check it out!!!"}
{"text":"This place is near my boyfriends softball fields so we stopped by before for happy hour. Tuesdays they have a blue moon special for $3 so I got that & the bf got another beer. We got $6 boneless wings ; $10 combo platter, & a side of flies (not sure the price). The boneless wings were AMAZING, I think we got the flavor \"Jess\", oh my gosh delicious. The combo platter was HUGE for the two of us, potato skins were decent, mozzarella sticks were good but different (in a wonton wrapper), onion rings were great, and the pretzel sticks were awesome. These all came with a bunch of sauces -- marinara, cheese, & ranch. We also got steak fries on the side which were delicious as well. All of the food & beers (5 total - two 16oz & three 22 oz) for $40, cant beat that -- we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of our favorites.  Great wings and we love their lavoshes.  Good selection of beers and they make a great margarita!"}
{"text":"So it's my understanding that the same people that own Teakwoods used to own Long Wong's in downtown Tempe.  That's probably why I love the wings here so much, and the ranch is excellent, too."}
{"text":"This is definitely your typical sports bar - a mix between an abundance of TVs, mediocre bar food, and peanut shells lining the bar floor (that last part is my absolute favorite part of the bar). 

They have a good amount of outdoor seating which is another bonus. It's also located in an area without many bars which makes it a popular hangout for many people on Friday & Saturday nights, which is when it gets pretty crowded. 

Overall... average, which is not a bad thing for the middle of Gilbert :)"}
{"text":"I've been to Teakwoods a couple different times and have enjoyed myself each and every time. My last visit was one of the most memorable. We were there in large group and they ran out of the larger draft glasses on the last 2 of us (me and my boyfriend). So, they brought us each out a mini-pitcher full of beer and charged us for the glass. Amazing! 

The service is great- quick and friendly and with peanuts on the table, you can't go wrong. Inside, it's your standard local bar (with peanut shells all over the floor). And, on the outside, it's tucked inside a strip mall with ample parking."}
{"text":"The best wings in the Valley hands down!!!!

But you have to get them Grilled and I had Garlic. The size of the wings are so much better than other places not anorexic chickens here like at wild wings or hooters. Their choice of sauces are good they could expand but have a great selection now and all very tasty. 

I have also had their burgers, chicken sandwich, and French dip and all were really good. Plus they have TOTS yes back to grade school we go and their crisp and hot :)"}
{"text":"The wings were very tasty! We got mild and teriyaki sauce. I got the pulled chicken sandwich and it was very good. My Wife got the French dip and she said it was just okay. Love the ability to eat peanuts and throw them on the floor! :)"}
{"text":"BEST WINGS POSSIBLY EVER.

Do not miss out. You have GOT to get the jess jess wings... I also tried the el heffe style on a chicken sandwich, which was good. I'd recommend just getting a load of wings in the two styles and judging for yourself, since I've never heard of any other place preparing them this way.... very tasty. Also got the cheese curds, which, if you've never been to wisconsin, you've got to try: they held up to the midwest standard and were super yummy (though they will put you into a milkfat coma).

Nice deals on beer, and what's better than making a mess on the floor with some peanut shells? Very fun."}
{"text":"Ive never been a fan of Teakwoods food, but they usually have good drinks specials.

All I ask is that if you have a specific drink special, like say, Four Peak Fridays list the beers that you have for them. Somewhere. Anywhere. On the printed \"special\" menu for the day, on a chalkboard, SOMEWHERE. Also, we had someone at our table that asked the waitress for a hefe that wasnt Blue Moon and she said \"We have Shock Top\", but failed to mention that the Shock Top that they have was the October seasonal- not the usual hefe.

Other than a few issues, which usually involve uninformed waitresses, this place is a great place to watch a game. Lots of TVs, pitcher specials, free peanuts, and after the game, good live music."}
{"text":"nice staff, food was good, but don't eat too many peanuts before your meal."}
{"text":"This review is given with a heavy heart. Over the last year we have been turned away from obtaining the wing order that we want repeatedly week after week. We had resorted to calling ahead to see if they would do it, and time after time they have refused to sell wings the way we request. It's quite simple some people want all drummies or all paddles and some do not. Refusing this simple request has cost them our loyalty. We paid happily their \"surcharge\" when they decided they would up the cost by dollars for getting wings either way. However, the extra money was not good enough for them. 14 years of being a loyal customer didn't matter. Btw - Moonshine grill around the corner, and Gilbert Pizza will sell their wings as all paddles or all drummies. Unfortunately they also revamped their menu and took off the only other menu options that we were willing to change our order for. There is just no reason to go back. More than a year of poor customer service and stubborn policy is enough."}
{"text":"Major deduction for menu states wing price as 9.99, bill came and we were charged 10.99. We would have pointed it out but out had already taken us 20 mins to get the tab. Our server was overwhelmed with his section and struggled to keep up all night. We cut him some slack because we could tell he was trying. Food was great, atmosphere was good."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to have a date night here since we had heard good things about their burgers from close friends and even on the reviews online! I'd definitely be going back! Their burgers are huge, so be prepared! But they taste amazing, great environment, great prices for amazing burgers!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened but this visit all the food was just awful. Maybe it was just an off night but I got the chicken Mac Mac and there was way too much cheese and the pasta seemed overcooked. My father got the French dip and there was barely any meat, the meat that was there was super dry and didn't have flavor. The staff were super nice though... Maybe next time will be better"}
{"text":"There is nothing better in life than Teakwoods.

Service is AMAZING! For a \"throw your peanuts on the floor\" type of bar, their food is outstanding! BBQ Chicken lavosh with muenster cheese, cheese curds, wings, salads...everything is amazing and fresh! They have great breakfast and bloody mary specials too.

The service is also superb! 

Plus $2.00 Rolling Rocks all day every day. You can't beat it. 

I am officially in love with Teakwoods."}
{"text":"we recently moved into the neighborhood and Teakwoods has quickly become one of our favorites for lunch and drinks.   We do have to take away one star based on there breakfast  not as good as there wings and salads."}
{"text":"My hubby and I took the kids there and sat outside during happy hour. The service was great, they had decent HH specials on both drinks and food. The kids had fun with the peanuts. We were the only ones outside and our server did a great job of remembering we were out there. I think it would have been pretty pricey to have a full dinner there, but the HH specials made it affordable with 3 kids."}
{"text":"Food is always good, staff is friendly.  But today one of the waitress young blonde, which is normally very friendly because She has waited on me few times over the last year, just wasn't friendly as normal.  I guess everyone can have off day."}
{"text":"Good food, large portions, very crowded.  Waited 45 minutes at 7p on Friday, but worth the wait.  Specialty was definitely the wings."}
{"text":"Definitely a dive bar.  It was really dark in there when we got there around 5:30pm.  There is a \"restaurant\" side to it where they seat families with children, which I can appreciate, even having a small child myself.  Service was decent.  Had to wait a little bit for our waters and other drinks, and had to ask twice for a cup of water for our son.  Food was actually a little bit better than I anticipated, though my expectations were low just based on appearances.  I ordered the Chicken Jack, which was a chicken burger with avocado, bacon, & pepperjack cheese.  The ranch beans was a pretty good side too.

If you're looking for a nice, clean, peaceful place to take your family to enjoy a nice dinner, this isn't the place for you.  If you want a place to hang out, throw down a few beers, watch some UFC, and throw peanut shells on the ground as you eat them, then you found your spot.  I won't be a regular there, but I am not opposed to going back in the future.

Side note:  They accept the Passport card.  You get a free entree of equal or lesser value.  That's really why I tried this place out."}
{"text":"This is my spot! Their food is pretty good and their happy hour specials and not too shabby. The staff is friendly and will greet you with a warm smile. What's not to love about a place that has it all? 

I personally would recommend their mozzarella sticks. They're absolutely delicious and come with marinara sauce. I could seriously eat the entire thing. I know because I've done it before. Not my proudest moment. 

Stop by and experience this all for yourselves! Trust me on the mozzarella sticks! The nachos are pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Since Teakwoods always came up as a source for great wings, we jetted over and checked it out. We'd been to the one that closed in Scottsdale awhile back. very large sports bar (the TVs were small but covered every wall). So great for sports fans. We ordered El Heffe, the Thai wings, and regular old hot. I loved the hot myself, they were HOT, a couple levels over Hooters hot. Flavor was great. The Thai wings had fresh basil leaves fried on and chili flakes in the sauce. My guest loved them, Also the heffe wings with Cilantro and garlic grilled onto them were pretty good. I still prefer the good old hot wing which we ordered with a great blue cheese dressing on the side. Comes with carrots and celery

Beer was old and they always give you a fresh iced glass with a refill, This is a wonderful thing....bill was very reasonable $15 for beers and wings. Now THAT'S happy hour!"}
{"text":"Upon arriving in the valley to start my new journey, Teskwoods was the first place I went to try out. Walking in a seeing peanut shells all over the floor, I knew that this was my kind of place. But again, I'm pretty easy to please. The wings were okay. They had an okay selection of beer. The buffalo chicken sandwich is what won my heart. That being said, I will always make time to come back here. If friends are visiting from out of town, I make sure we stop here for lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"Food was good, however a little pricey for a grill.  The Service could use some help.  We joined a large party for a celebration (about 15 of us) and it only took the Server about 25 minutes to get our beverages, had to ask her if she was going to bring them  - couldn't understand the delay. The woman sitting across from us asked us to  please grab on to the Server because she had asked for a glass of water several times and the Waitress didn't bring it.  It is LOUD here, hard to visit with anyone sitting at our table.   If you have a peanut allergy, stay away, peanut shells are discarded on table & floors.   Management either needs to schedule more staff at this crowded, loud sports bar or get new help - although there was not a wait,( think we had the tail end of the happy hour crowd).  We didn't see the attraction and won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been here on a number of occasions with a different experience every time. Overall I would say it's an average place to eat - as long as you stick with bar food staples like burgers, fries, and onion rings.

Walking in, we stood for about five minutes before a server even appeared to take us to a table. After ordering, we waited around thirty minutes for our food and then about ten after we gave the server our card to pay. It was a Thursday night and about three other families were dining in the restaurant so we didn't understand the delay. Imagine coming here when it was actually busy!

I ordered a Caesar salad and skinny fries while my friends ordered a burger and a French dip sandwich. They mostly enjoyed their meal but I had the worst Caesar salad I've ever eaten. The lettuce was room temperature and soggy due to the fact that they completely drowned it in dressing, and it was topped off with about five raw onions (?) that were made for the burgers. 

My party agreed the service was pretty bad and I definitely would not come back except to order a burger and fries."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here numerous times, and we have never had a bad experience! We love the boneless wings 'jess jess style', and any lavosh is great and big enough to share!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and they are consistent. I get a side kick salad and 12 plain wings grilled each time they come out perfect.  They used to have a dressing argen? But they for rid of it. They also have tator tots which is always a plus. Not as good as the wings at the hub but a close second"}
{"text":"Rating is only for the wings: Wings wings wings! They have the best wings I've ever had! Get honey hot grilled (you need to say \"grilled\").  Even when they're burnt they're the best ever!  

This rating is only for their wings. The few times I've had food here, it wasn't that good. So stick to drinks and wings!"}
{"text":"Got to tell you, the Philly cheesesteak gets a four stars from. This one is better than some of the ones I've had in Philly. I'm not kidding! Many local beers and imports, tons of TVs and of course the infamous vibrating Peanuts ;)"}
{"text":"Went with the Mama's Meatloaf (recommended by regular patron) and it came with mashed potatoes and garlicy brocolli... was delicious and enough for a second meal later at home! My husband had the clam chowder and the wings (which is a popular item) and he enjoyed both."}
{"text":"My wife I had lunch at Teakwoods and it was fair at best. My wife had the fish tacos and I had their chicken mac mac which is penne pasta in a cheese sauce with shredded chicken, sprinkled with bread crumbs and parmesan cheese. The portions were extremely generous but it just didn't taste good. That's too bad because I could have taken a lot of leftovers home for a second meal. My wife's tacos consisted of overcooked fish nuggets. We had mozzarella sticks for an appetizer and they weren't cooked enough. A very disappointing meal all around. I do have to give a shout out to our waitress though. She was a great with a friendly personality and always a smile on her face. She was very attentive to us and made sure our drink cups were always full. She is a huge asset for that restaurant/bar."}
{"text":"Hands down, best wings I've ever eaten in my life! And I consider myself to be something of a connosieur when it comes to the wings! Try the Jes Jes wings... They throw the wings on the grill for the last few minutes of cooking to get them perfectly crispy, then toss them with their medium sauce, blue cheese crumbles, and diced garlic! Shit I'm getting hungry just thinking about them!
The place itself is very divey... you'll either love it or hate it... they always have sports on the tv, and daily food and drink specials!
If nothing else, do yourself a favor and at least come here for the wings!!"}
{"text":"oh these wings were freaking amaaizizznzng,

el heffe i believe they were... the bartender seemed very cool and concerened on what i was getting.. great suggestions."}
{"text":"It would be so nice if this place was closer to home--though not for my waistline since I could literally drink that jalapeño ranch they serve with their delicious sweet potato waffle fries. Yes, it's good this place is a drive for me. 

Love the Midwest tavern vibe of this place. Cameron was our server tonight and he was fantastic. It's always nice when your server loves the food he serves. His recommendations were great. The jalapeño popper potato skins were very good, but they would be amazing with bacon (hell, what isn't?!). They are served with a concoction called cactus sauce--sweet, tangy, yup this could go on anything. Can't wait to try it on their wings. My husband loved that he could get a fried egg on his burger and I really enjoyed my buffalo chicken tacos. Wish they had a cocktail menu, but this is really a cold beer place anyway. We will be back!"}
{"text":"So I was out in the boons (Gilbert is fo SHO, the boons) having my car looked at.  I needed to kill some time and walked down here to do such and to grab a bite to eat. 

I was pleasantly surprised.  Located in a strip mall (Hi, it's Gilbert) it's an assumsming bar and grill.  I got one of the daily specials:  half an egg salad sandiwch and a salad. The 'half' sandwich was enormous and quite delicious. The egg salad was fresh and served on toasted bread with tomato and lettuce . The salad was also enormous and served homemade Ranch. Yum!

Great prices and service."}
{"text":"Went on a whim and was highly impressed, the food was excellent. Burger was cooked to my liking along with excellent service. Will be back for their great burgers."}
{"text":"I was lured in by the fact they have cheese curds as I googled best cheese curds in Phoenix and this is one of the places that came up on that list.  As an individual who grew up in Wisconsin you can remove this location from that list entirely.  The cheese curds were over priced ($10) for a marginal amount and they were extremely bland. The jalapeno ranch dipping sauce was the only saving grace.

I also ordered some of their famous wings with honey hot sauce. Funny part about claiming something is famous is you don't mention what they are famous for. Famously mediocre? Famous for not being famous?  In fairness, they weren't bad, but they weren't good.

I enjoyed the atmosphere and the bucket of peanuts is a good snack while you wait.  The staff was very friendly and deserved a tip for good service. 

I came for the cheese curds and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Completely watered down drinks and obnoxiously loud staff that think it's ok to shout orders and drink requests across the bar. An extra star because the warm pretzel with cheese appetizer was slightly redeeming!"}
{"text":"Best. Wings. Ever.

I think they're fried and then grilled? I don't know. I just know they're ridiculously good. I'm a picky wing eater. I like them cooked a very specific way and that's how they make them, and it's probably why they win awards. Also, they allow me to order all flats, which makes me extra happy. If you're a chicken wing lover, you've probably already tried this place. If not, you ought to. Immediately."}
{"text":"Teakwoods is another great place for wings in this area. 

Seriously, if you're thinking about going to Wing Stop, turn around and go to Teaks. Come on. You're already in the area, right?

Chill ambiance. Enjoy some peanuts and drop your shells on the floor if you please. 

Great spot for a casual workweek lunch, live music on the weekend, or just catching a game. 

Plenty of beers on tap for everyone's taste.

I haven't ventured much beyond the wings, but with good reason: They're delicious!

Two of my favorites are classic Hot, Suicide. Plenty of sauce and finished just crispy enough.

Don't forget to check out their unique wing combinations! The Jess Jess is a combo of their Medium sauce and BLEU CHEESE cooked into the wings. And it will blow.your.mind. 

Since I carry the \"Yelp Torch\" in our relationship, Dude approves of this place. 

Not so sure if it's the wings, or the t-shirts with the Teakwoods Moose you can purchase that say, \"Nice rack!\" but know we'll be back -  Wings for sure; maybe I'll finally buy one of the shirts.

Check out Teakwoods on your quest for great wings in Chandler."}
{"text":"My husband and I went tonight to teakwoods for the first time. We had a groupon. The place was packed.  Different football games going on tvs all over the place. I didn't mind, but my hubby was in heaven:)   Hostess told us every table was full except outside. So went outside, turned right around because I forgot about smokers, lol. 
   We waited about 1 min and the hostess asked us if we would mind sharing a table with another couple. We said sure.  There was 6 chairs  and 4 of us total so 2 empties inbetween us. It was same as if we had our own table. Worked out great:)

 We started off with the jess Jess boneless wings- Delish!!!!! Not wet like other wings in fact I think they coat them and then throw them on the grill. We Loved them!
I ordered a southern thang burger - my  hubby got a Teaks touch ém all. They were huge!  We each ended up taking half home.  Not just huge but tasty. I loved mine.    We decided to pay and use the groupon another time to ensure we would remember to come back:)

Great place- waitress nice and friendly, good food- we will eat there again!"}
{"text":"Love the Jess Jess- They closed location closest to us- We drive to this one. Just for the wings."}
{"text":"I've always had good experiences at teakwoods, especially when it comes to the food. My favorite are the pretzels and cheese. We went Friday night, and it was moderately packed. However, neither of the two hosts were very bright. The first one didn't tell us the wait time and didn't ask us if we preferred to sit inside or outside. I asked them what time happy hour ends & it both had no idea and no clue how to figure out how to find out. Finally, she went to a table & got a sign that said the happy hour times but still told me the wrong time even though it was written in front of her. (Happy hour is from 4-6 pm M-F)  You would think that someone working at a sports bar would know the happy hour times. We asked them what our wait time would be & it took them forever to come up with a number, which I think they just made up. When it was time to be seated, the host didn't say a single word to as she brought us to our table. Just set down the menus and walked away. Other than that, the waiter and the rest of the service and food was still good. If I hadn't been to teakwoods before, I probably would have left before I saw the waiter because of how irritating the host was!"}
{"text":"We like to go here when we can't think of anywhere else to eat and everyone wants something different.  We usually hit it up on Friday for the happy hour and the hope they have fish tacos that day.  

Like any sports bar, you got TVs showing all games, and you couple of arcade games in the corner.  

Service has always been good and the food never fails.  Prices seem high but really, we go there for the alcohol.  The kids like it cause they have a bunch of stuff to choose from, they can throw peanuts on the ground, and make as much noise as they want.  Good family atmosphere."}
{"text":"Never ever order a drink with a garnish or straw. Food safety is ignored as I watched the entire staff, including the manager, grab orange and lime slices with unwashed hands.
They also use dirty fingers to grab staws to add to the drinks.

I will never have a Blue Moon beer there again."}
{"text":"Too bad the service is simply horrible and slow, because, the food is pretty good. We've been here, at least 6 times, at different times of the day. It doesn't matter when you come , just plan on lack of service. Last night was the last shot for us. Came in after work. It was 930pm on a Saturday. It was about 1/3 full, so not too busy. A couple of tables sitting around, looking, obviously waiting for drinks or checks. We were seated, and our server came by, took drink orders. Drinks were dropped off, and he took off before we could say that we were ready to order. So, we waited, and waited, and waited some more. The table behind us had been trying it pay for a while,and was obviously frustrated. We watched our server dude go lean against the bar for a while. Disappear in the back for a while. Stand in the kitchen line and talk for a while. Lean against the register for a while. He went and took another tables drink order. Took their drinks. And watched them order. He then dropped off the check at the table behind us, and looked at us, and stared to retreat, when I called out to him, waving. We asked for a manager, to address this lack of service problem, as we had been waiting for 15-20 minutes, just to order. He gave a quick panicked look, and said \"uhh, oh, there isn't one\". We told him that we had been ready to order, since we got our drinks and had been trying to get his attention the whole time, to order, while watching him in the corner, having a good time, laughing, talking etc, but obviously, not wanting to serve tables. We offered to pay for our tea, and left. If they had been busy, I get the slowness, and would expect delays. But, there were 4 tables and a handful of people sitting at the bar, and 2 of the tables were done, 1 just waiting for her card back to leave. She sympathized with us leaving, agreeing that this is just too dang slow."}
{"text":"Cool little bar and grill located in a non-description strip mall.  Stopped in for a late night bite to eat and a beer after arriving in town.  Along with a local beer, I opted for an order of the Mozzarella Wrappers and an orders to the Hot BBQ wings.  The Mozzarella Wrappers are basically mozzarella in a fried wonton.  They are pretty big and very filling, the crunch on the outside wonton was an interesting change from your basic breaded stick.  Not bad for an appetizer.  My coworker brought me here for the wings though.  They were cooked well, with a nice crispy skin, and the Hot BBQ sauce was on point.  Meaty and delicious.  Washed down with a couple Kilt Lifters, I left with a very full belly.  Respectable wings!"}
{"text":"My wife and I rolled in here late yesterday afternoon to meet some of her friends. I dig joints like this as its relaxed and homey feeling. My eye immediately caught the huge vat barrel of salted peanuts at the front door - Score! Nothing like eating peanuts and chucking the shells on the floor or at other people. 

Started off with a nice refreshing pint of Guinness which hit the spot and was on special. My wife and I ordered a dozen regular chicken wings to start.And by the way, when did that automatically become the norm to serve ranch with wings. I live for a while near Buffalo in Rotten-chester...eerrrr...Rochester New York and wings are definitely supposed to be served with Blue Cheese as the dipping sauce...I digress.

Anywho, after I ordered I said to myself \"Dam, I forgot to tell her blue cheese\" and not the nasty ranch everyone seems to serve. When the wings arrived they were attractively plump and not dripping in wing sauce, which I find disconcerting, and low and behold there are 2 LARGE ramekins of sauce - one blue cheese and one ranch. Steven Tyler Pj's, Steven Tyler PJ's...nice call Teakwoods. The wings were really good too...I nearly canceled my dinner order and replaced it with more wings (and I should have). Only issue with the wing app there was only 4 measly pieces of celery garnished on the plate.

For dinner, I ordered the Caesar Salad with \"Grilled & Chilled\" shrimp. Sounded good...tasted awful...and for $13 bucks far from a good value. The salad itself wasn't bad but a Caesar should be mostly the hearts of Romaine and not inundated with the leafy crap.  I also overlooked the Caesar faux pas of the red onion rings...but the shrimp was unforgivable. My guess is the 13 dollar price point is based on the fact that it has shrimp in it and apparently the menu description of \"Grilled & Chilled\" shrimp actually in essence means cook a large batch of shrimp and throw them in the cooler until someone orders that salad we serve them in. That pasty mushy old shrimp taste is still in my mouth today...zoiks! Fresh grilled skewer of shrimp off the grill in the salad would have made a HUGE difference AND justified me throwin' down 16 bucks for it, which is how much you figure it costs with the tip. Maybe the owner should watch an episode of Chef Ramsey's \"Kitchen Nightmares,\" in fact any episode, and see how he preaches about the evils of the friggin' lazy cook it all ahead of time method. 

My wife has been on Phase 1 of South Beach diet for 2 weeks and was totally cravin' a nice cheeseburger and fires. She was psyched to see sliders on the menu; however, they too were a HUGE disappointment, in fact she didn't even finish them. The bread was not moist and obviously stale, and the meat was dry and tasteless. They screwed up the fries...how do you screw up fries?  She said they were hot but dry and utterly tasteless...dude...some type of seasoning...any seasoning. 

Teakwoods did get 3 stars from which otherwise would have been 1 or 2 because the servers were cool and efficient, I liked the vibe, and free peanuts always pull me in like an electro-magnet. 

Two parting words of advice for this restaurant \"Fresh Ingredients.\""}
{"text":"Teakwood's is a nice neighbor bar and grill with some really delicious food and nice size portions. On each table is a bucket of peanuts with instructions to toss the shells on the floor. I've been here a number of times and I've never been disappointed. The candlestick carver is one of the best sandwiches with roast beef, provolone cheese, and a chile, served with au jus. There are numerous sides to choose from. Lots of daily specials as well. Today I had a chile relleno  served with a walnut cream sauce. Delicious! The tortilla soup is also very, very good.  There were 4 people in my party and all were happy with their selections.  The atmosphere is also fun. Friendly staff and good quality HDTV's to watch a game, chat and relax with friends.  I am a big fan of this place."}
{"text":"The wings are pretty good and they have some good happy hour/reverse happy hour specials. Our bartender was friendly & attentive. Their quesadilla is okay - not the best/worst that I've had."}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood spot, they always have a Groupon so be sure to check that out....wings are great, trivia nights are interactive and a lot of fun! Great bar and greater bar food...service is always on point."}
{"text":"I walked in and I was immediately digusted by this place. Want a crap load of peanuts? No seriously, when you walk in there is a huge bushel of peanuts, and you can get as much as you want! Done with the shells? Just leave them on the table then brush them aside. The end result? A restaurant with peanut shells all over the place. Actually, to be quite honest, I'm being a little harsh here. I thought it was cool that they did this unlimited free peanuts thing, but it was like they were trying to compensate for something else.

Well, when I got my food I figured out what they were trying to compensate for. The salad and 'breadsticks' were just plain bad. However, I didn't really expect much. I was actually hoping my wings would be good and that the salad was just a side. The wings are nothing special at all. I thought the 'El Hefe' wings were somewhat decent, but I don't think I could have more than a half-dozen of those. Hot wings? What hot wings? I thought I ordered some, but maybe the waiter got confused. I got some cold wings with red sauce on them, they tasted 'vinegary' and that's about all.

To be fair, the service was pretty good and the server was friendly. She was helping us make decisions since it was our first time, but the food was cold on multiple occasions. A previous reviewer mentioned gorgeous staff... Not quite sure why you would prefer that instead of good food, go to a strip club? Maybe if the food was hot it could be different, but I really doubt it since the recipes here are just way off the mark.

There is really nothing special about this place. The wings are over priced for what you get, and there is better stuff available 5 minutes away from here. I love wings, and I've been trying so hard to find a good wing place in Phoenix, but I think my search continues for the time being."}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner on a Saturday night. They were busy but there were open tables. We got seated immediately. Party of 4. The menu isn't overly complicated. We all ordered sandwiches. They were well prepared and delicious. Plenty of food and at a fair price. Great service too."}
{"text":"Great place to go to for barfood the wings are fantastic although kind of expensive. You can go there as a family during the daytime and the kids usually do pretty good since they have peanuts that you can throw on the floor which they all love. Would be five star if the price was a little lower. The staff have always been amazing when we go grab a drink after work or even take the kids for a quick bite on a weekend."}
{"text":"Food was great but service was horrible.. We had a waiter and waitress ( must be shadowing) and during the hour we were there, we saw them 3 times.. I finished my beer halfway through appetizer and never saw anyone till I personally flagged down person for bill ( server 164)... Would have ordered more food and drinks but can't when no one comes around... I did see them standing by kitchen area doing nothing but service must not be priority here.. beware"}
{"text":"Great service, free peanuts, wings were delicious, lots of interesting people and they had awesome live music.  Very cool place, check it out."}
{"text":"Some of the best hot wings that I have ever had...and they always have cold, local beer on tap. Tempe's finest (Long Wong's on Mill owners) in Chandler."}
{"text":"I made my first foray into this establishment yesterday and was surprised by what I found. I don't know why, but the title of the restaurant had me envisioning stuffy people reinventing the hot wing. That's not what I found. Instead, I was treated to a down to earth bar and grill with food that tasted the way it should.

The sandwich board out front as well as numerous signs on the walls and tabletop informed me of the unbelievable number of special drink deals this place offers. I'd be astonished if someone showed up any day of the week and couldn't find a cocktail or beer they'd enjoy at a discounted price.

I ordered the hot wings and, while I wasn't blown away, they tasted as they should and were just hot enough. After relaxing with a couple beers, we ordered the soft pretzels which were fantastic. If your biggest complaint with a pretzel is that it's tied up, Teakwoods is for you. We received long strips of buttered pretzels (is it really a pretzel if it's straight? A discussion better left to a different forum) with a bowl of cheese dipping sauce.

As has been mentioned dozens of times in other reviews, they offer buckets of peanuts and allow the shells to hit the floor. This may sound fun, but as my date said \"I feel bad for throwing this on the floor.\" Ok, maybe that's just her. The place is fun, the food is good,  and the price is great."}
{"text":"The TV situation at the bar and dining area is horrendous. The bar layout is horrible. Extremely small (22\") TVs at bar (only visible from Just a few seats).  TVs in dining area are horribly positioned as well. AND THEY'RE NOT HDTVs??!?!!?!

Free peanuts is a nice touch.

Definitely not the place to watch a game."}
{"text":"Service, TVs, prices, bloody Mary bar, free wifi, free peanuts, 15% off for texting their VIP club, etc = 5 stars.

TV sound = 0 stars!! Watching biggest game so far of the year - it's on all TVs but the sound is horrible -- not nearly loud enough, pitifully few speakers, etc. I'm sitting 10' away from the speakers at the stage and can barely hear. FIX IT!!!!!  Shame. Could have been sooo great.

UPDATE- manager just turned up sound! Upping review by 2 stars. Still need more speakers in bar area and more TVs too -- there is only 1 tv for the whole bar area...

Bathrooms not good--no dividers between urinals, urinals too close to sinks. AND THE MIRROR ALLOWS EXTREMELY AWKWARD AND DIRECT VIEW TO THE LINE OF URINALS."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this Teakwoods in several years, and was really disappointed with this trip. We stopped in because we had an hour to kill and had to stay nearby.   It was 105 outside and humid, and not much cooler inside.  Got to crank the AC up 

We ordered chips and salsa, sweet potato waffle fries and some grilled hot wings.  The chips and salsa was nothing special, the waffle fries were ok.  The wings were sad.  Just sad.  Maybe, if generous, each wing had a decent mouthful of meat on them.  For my ten year old.  These were the tiniest, scrawniest, thinnest, most pathetic wings I have been served in years.  We couldn't even taste sauce on them as everything was gristle.  

There was zero energy to anyone on the entire staff. Maybe it was too hot?  I don't know if this is the norm here but I would struggle to find a reason to come back."}
{"text":"After our last disappointment I wrote to Teakwoods and they invited us back; dinner on them. Again, we ordered a couple of burgers. This time the burgers were cooked exactly how we wanted them, seasoned nicely, the cheese was melted and the bacon was perfect. The meal was very good this time. Now, keep in mind the manager knew we were coming in and which table we were. So now we have to come back again to see how the service and food is without management babysitting our table. We both hope our next time in will be just as good as the last because we both really want to like this place."}
{"text":"This place is like any other in the Gilbert area. Not a good bar, not a good restaurant, but a mediocre place trying to be both. It has very few dinner specials and a poor beer selection. I considered leaving after I looked at the menu. But I was starving and they had peanuts. The food was OK, the service was nice and pretty quick but the place was empty. I won't be returning here."}
{"text":"This place is great. I like the laid back atmosphere and the fact that the offer groupons and deals frequently. The food has always been good, the drinks are gigantic (which is great because I like a lot to drink with my meals), and the service is always pleasant and consistent. My only complaint is that sometimes it's way too loud and I can barely have a conversation with my boyfriend across the table. The place is family friendly so there's always a lot of kids screaming/crying/dropping things and the TVs when football is on are sometimes loud."}
{"text":"Ok so let's be real.... it's not a cute or quaint little restaurant, it's a sports bar.


But typical bar food is NOT what you're getting. The food is amazing.

I'm a huge fan of the pretzel and most of the burgers. The wings are wonderful. Like, everything is so so so good. And tons of variety. It's straight up wonderful.

I like to order out on grub hub."}
{"text":"The food is okay. We went on a Wednesday early dinner not busy but boy were they slow. We only saw our waitress once to order once to bring out the food and then flagged her down for the check. Went to the restroom and she's in the back on her phone. We just wanted to eat and go but they made it take forever.  Even with a Groupon this place is pretty pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"If you are into the type of place where you toss the peanut shells on the floor you will feel right at home here.   They have a healthy happy hour and a large menu for your typical bar and grill establishment.  You can reserve a large side room if you are having a big party and the waitstaff is spot on."}
{"text":"Teakwoods has some of the best food in Phoenix!!! I've been going there for a year or so and have NEVER been disappointed. I have tried many things on the menu, including the El Hefe and Jess Jess wings, fried pickles, lavash, mozz sticks, and burgers. Honestly, everything is so delicious there and I have always had great service, as well. There is also a man, nicknamed Rojo, who works there who has to be the nicest and hardest working man in Phoenix! He is there almost every time I go. They also always have a groupon which rocks and pretty much makes it impossible to not have it on my mind all the time. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Always reliably good. Portions have shrunk lately and that's OK, but their prices have also increased which is no bueno"}
{"text":"We love Teakwoods. This is our favorite spot for wings, drinks, and assortment of great food. The service here is great too. If you love wings, try Teakwoods!"}
{"text":"At first, I couldn't decide whether this place was kid friendly.  I usually shy away from restaurant slash bars with loud music and loud patrons.  On the other hand, they have high chairs, a kids menu with a word search, a number tracing picture, and tic tac toe.  There are nine, count'em, nine kid's menu items, and four are vegetarian friendly.  And there is a \"family room\".  I was still not convinced.  The first time I came here there was a party going on in the family room, and it seemed like we were just crammed in the corner of the restaurant.  So my daughter's school had a fundraiser at Teakwoods.  Fifteen percent of the bill went to support the school.  Maybe kid friendly, but still not connived.  Could the school be wrong?  The place was slammed and, at first, I thought we would be waiting for long periods of time for not showing up early, but management was helping pick up the slack and I assume that it was an unusually high volume Monday.  My daughter was a little skeptical about throwing peanuts on the floor, so I'm not sure if that counts as kid friendly.  She would hold out the peanut shell and watch it fall in disbelief.  There is also a video game machine with two classic arcade games, one was Galaga, one of those hutin' shootin' games, and a claw.  I resisted my daughter's urge to spend my money.  And then I noticed that the kids were playing Duck, Duck, Goose on the floor in the family room.  Okay, this places is definitely kid friendly.  How dare you think otherwise.  The wings are great, the beer cold, the Ruben dry, the spaghetti a little light on the sauce, the cups large, the wait staff overwhelmed, why didn't I get wings like last time, and Teakwoods is kid friendly."}
{"text":"Loved it!

We had the El Jeffe wings.  They smelled divine and tasted even better.  They were fresh, hot and flavorful with a good dose of heat!

I also love any place that has fresh hot tater tots...so I was a sucker for those.  They were great along with the Candlestick carver.

It's on Groupon again today!"}
{"text":"Buffalo Wings.. Food of the gods.
Beer.. Nectar of the Gods..
Peanuts.. Just darn tasty.

All of this and more can be yours when you walk into teakwoods tavern. As a side project I've slowly been making my way through a list of recommended wing spots in the Valley. This one I was a little nervous about because just as many people told me they had great wings as told me they had bad wings. The only other place I've experience this with is Long Wongs where the day to day quality of the wings can swing drastically.

Entering the building we are instantly and enthusiastically greeted by a nice lady who shows us to our table in this nice dark establishment. Less then a minute goes by and our cute, enthusiastic, seemingly genuine waitress shows up to take our drink over.

My buddy Chris asks whats on tap and she rattles off what must be 20 or so beers. Feeling a little flirty, with a serious face, I ask her what the 3rd one she listed again. She puts me in my place instantly saying \"bud light was 3rd.\" Youch.. owned ;)

All three of us dig into the peanuts enjoying the fact that we get to toss the shells on the floor. They were really good and got you nice and thirsty for some good beer.

Onto the main business which was ordering the wings we had come for. One thing I did not like was the limited quantity options. Half dozen(6.00), dozen(7.99), or bucket(39.95), what kind of craziness is this? I can order 6, 12 or 72? There are three of us.. We aren't making it through 72 wings and $8 a dozen bah. These better be really good. This definitely needs to be addressed :/

We decide on two dozen hot, and one dozen Honey BBQ Hot. I'm not a big fan of anything but classic hot or face melting hot wings. But it cant be about me all the time :p Oh and following everyones advice I order them extra crispy which is supposed to deliver original long wongs style wings.

Less then 10 minutes pass and out come the wings. They are a little less crispy then I would have liked but at least they were not rubbery.

MMMmmmmm these are really good! I think the wings were frozen but they are still tasty. The sauce has the right fat/vinegar combo but its obvious that they add an extract to get extra heat. This is how it should be done. You can only make wings so hot with franks and butter. Eventually they just end up more vinegary. Wow the honey BBQ also had the same heat minus the vinegar aspect. Looks like I was spot on with the pepper extract. Usually these are \"hot\" because someone put red pepper flakes. These were actually decent.. but still to sweet for my taste. The rest of the table liked them.

I would say so far these are in the top 3 in the valley. I would definitely return here for some wings and peanuts. Rating would be higher except for the horrible quantity ordering options."}
{"text":"If there was zero stars that's what I would give...  service was slow, it took over 40 minutes to get our food for lunch during a slow time.  \"New\" $3/dzn wings up charge due to minimum wage increase (now $14/dzn) AND the topper, server killed a roach literally right next to my chair.  We used to have this place in the normal Friday lunch rotation but will never be back.  And just paid $19 without a tip for a tea and chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Teakwoods is a great local place to have great wings they also have awsome soft pretzels with cheese dip, large bar and dinning area service is fast and good one of thoses places with peanut shells all over the floor and free peanuts on every table and very large portions of almost everything"}
{"text":"Reasonably loud inside, but a good atmosphere, friendly efficient service, excellent wings, great food generally."}
{"text":"Upon first glance this is appears to be a very usual strip mall type bar but behind the black glass lies a more unusual bar and grill.

We went on a Sunday for the Jets-Ravens game and it was a fun time.. This is one of those places you likely have passed a hundred times on the way to work or going to Scottsdale using Indian School Rd. It is set back into the strip mall so you would not see it from the street. Why Teakwoods is special comes from its extremely quality food which you would not expect from a place that lets you throw peanut shells on the floor. Like most bars it has a bevy of TV's and a rowdy but pleasant crowd. 

The food was really good though I would never call this \"fine dining\". An extremely great place to go when you want to be stuffed with semi-greasy food..I had their famous wings and I can honestly say they were outrageous. I especially liked the cheese balls which are hard to find as WineBurger stopped carrying them.

No particular reason this place wasn't 5 stars..it just didnt have that 5 star feel..maybe in the future when I go back."}
{"text":"Super disappointing experience.

Last night came in to dine about 8:30 PM.
Seated fairly quickly, that was the only good thing!

When we went to view the menu- we noticed another small flier \"in between\" the appetizer plates. I pulled it out & it had stated they are now changing a \"surcharge\" for wings! 
*See attached photo*

I have to say, we came there specifically for the wings and weren't going to pay additional.

During this timeframe we weren't approached by a server & we just wanted wings ( not at that price) so we decided to leave & go else where!

I could see if this was an actual WING restaurant claiming shortages or as they put it \"until supplies stabilize\"! I probably would have believed it & been more willing to pay the additional fee. This was just a bunch of BS as the problem is only with them. Change your food vendor if prices increase, but don't state their is a shortage when there's NOT!

We ended up @ another local joint that didn't have any added charges for chicken wings. Called BWW and they didn't implement this?! 

Sorry, but I won't be back again unit the surcharge fee is removed. I'm not willing to pay over $1.20 per wing! Rip off!"}
{"text":"Very nice staff but the AC was not working. The manager was great and offered us a discount on our next visit. We didn't get to try the food unfortunately it was too hot"}
{"text":"Only bad thing about this place is that during peak times, it gets too busy and things can be slow. Other than that, I love Teakwoods!

Pretzels with Cheese are the bomb!

Very large portions of food - good wings and burgers, great rotating specials and beer options, and who doesn't like to throw peanuts at people? (Er... I mean, throw peanut shells on the ground)."}
{"text":"I love this place for several reasons.  1.)  Excellent service all of the time.  2.)  Cold fresh beer on tap, can't be beat.  And 3.)   because all of the food I've tried there has been excellent.  They have burgers, fajitas and Philly cheese steak, to name a few choices.  The menu is extensive.  If you like your wings on the saucy side make sure to order them \"sloppy\" or they could come to you on the dry side, but still just as tasty.    Cold beer, great service, great food and ALL of the sports games on TV's.  It just can't be beat.  5 stars."}
{"text":"I'm glad that they have a Teakwoods in the East Valley, because it became my first favorite wing place after moving here. After finding other worthy wing options in the greater Phoenix metro area, I would qualify these wings as completely respectable. I can testify that the wings here are properly sauced, reasonably crispy, and meatier than most. I know some of you gals out there are very particular about the ever-important meat-to-bone ratio, so this is why I mention it. (There's a dirty joke in there somewhere... I just KNOW it!)

Anyhow, I'm a big fan of the unlimited peanuts/throw-your-shells-on-the-floor thing, so kudos for that. Here, however, is my main gripe: You really oughta chill your salads! I come here for the wings and I often order a side salad (perhaps to feel better about my chicken-meat gluttony or just to be right with that whole Atkins-on-crack approach). Every time I've been here, the salad has been a bit less than palatable because it sat somewhere warm before being brought to me. Chilled salad, good -- warm salad, bad!

So although my heart now belongs to other wing-serving establishments, I'll never forget you, Teakwoods. I respect you for your frosty beers and your bountiful nuts. And every now and then I may have to come back and sample your goodies. Just a nibble or two... to remind me of the love we once shared. (O.K.--Not to anthropomorphize a restaurant, but that last passage had dirty jokes resplendent!)"}
{"text":"I'm sure this place is great. I came for the breakfast was pleased to find the pancakes are delicious. It's hard to find decent panacakes when waffle house, dennys and ihop have a corner on it and they are by far some of the worst panacakes in the galaxy. These panacakes didn't even need syrup. The eggs were well prepared and the slices of tomatoe were fresh and thick. While the ambiance is just not my style I'm sure other people like this sort of hokey honkey dorry environment. Budlight signs have usually been a big turn off for me. I guess I'm all anti American beer. Otherwise people come for the free peanuts. They are good, I just think they should be disposed of properly. Not thrown on the floor. I don't get it. That seems unsanitary.

On a recurring theme, the service does seem unusually slow given how few people are here"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at Teakwoods. Great wings, great beer, great service.

I especially love the specials menu, they come up with some really cool dishes.

The atmosphere is really great too, very laid back with peanut shells on the floor. Teakwoods is a place where you can really chill out with friends or even on your own. It's always busy and everyone is in the mood to chat it up."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  I would recommend this place to anyone who asks. I love the atmosphere and the crowd.  I hade wings and draft beer. The sauce was boss! :)"}
{"text":"Delicious margaritas and stellar customer service on a Thursday night from our waitress.   I had finished my happy hour margarita and sat it down and literally no less than a minute later our waitress had scooped up my empty margarita glass and had replaced it with a fresh one.  

Now THAT'S paying attention to your customers!  Color me impressed!!  (And drunk.  Color me drunk too.  I needed a ride home that night.)"}
{"text":"I went to teakwoods  on Ray and Kyrene. They charged us a $3 surcharge because they say there is a  chicken shortage!! This is absolutely a joke I called around to their competitors and they said there is absolutely no upcharge on chicken wings or shortage LMAO. they flat-out lied to you if they had a negative five star I would  definitely give that to them. THEY SUCK I know times are tough but don't screw the public that supports your local neighborhood business"}
{"text":"Most of the food is average, especially the burgers. We usually eat here just for the wings and fried cheese curds, which are delicious."}
{"text":"Alright place to go for a game. Good food, good service, pretty relaxed atmosphere. Perfect for a Monday night game or a quick bite."}
{"text":"Service is very slow. Ordered take out prior to arrival and still waiting at the bar 30 minutes later. No one has even asked it I need anything since I first arrived.  Not sure how food is yet."}
{"text":"Food is ok, layout of the restaurant seems boring, they started a live band during the ASU football game which was lame."}
{"text":"Big fan of the wings and atmosphere to be honest. TV's all around with a sport on to keep you entertained. Help yourself to plenty of peanuts and just swipe the shells onto the floor. The kids dig the kids meals which are priced reasonable and include a good variety from pasta, burgers, hot dogs, fruit, veggies and or fries. A few video games to keep them busy and of course the cookie desert is a family share. 

They have daily specials for food and happy hour, Baja Wednesday they have house & flavored margaritas along with Mexican imports all for under $4 and Four Peaks Friday is exactly what it is..."}
{"text":"I hate this place I've lived here 25 years just around the corner I stopped going there 20 years ago horrible service horrible food"}
{"text":"Called in my Wings order. Picked it up at the bar right away. Everything was perfect. Love their Wings!"}
{"text":"Great place for the family but they do have a good bar area. Mac and cheese is amazing and so is the BBQ lavosh. Casual atmosphere and they let you throw your peanut shells on the floor. :)"}
{"text":"First time here.... Got here at 1028pm on a Monday (2016 September 26th), which according to Yelp says they'd be open, but they're not. Thanks for wasting our time and gas. Will update the review if they're open next time. Maybe management can fix their hours on Yelp."}
{"text":"Lets get this straight, $10 for 6 wings. You out of your mind???  $1.66 per wing. And the rest if the menu is way over priced also.  Good luck. Used to be decent, but not anymore."}
{"text":"We have lunch here a little over a week ago the atmosphere was lighthearted and fun. We ate out on the patio the drink glasses were huge and the food was fair we had a 50% discount coupon which made things fairly priced. I can't imagine paying double or twice as much for the food that I got"}
{"text":"The soft pretzel app is the bomb! I get it everytime I go. Service is always awesome and they have great drink specials. This is a great place to go for great food in a bar atmosphere"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite wing spots when I lived in AZ. I come back from Omaha on business two weeks a month and decided to meet a friend for dinner. Place was dead and the waitress (who was very attentive) handed us a laminated copy of their \"wing surcharge\". Apparently there has been some scourge of lost chickens that is driving up prices so they add a surcharge to every wing order. Conspiracy? Perhaps the Chic-fil-a cows perpetrated the biggest chicken heist in US History but thankfully the conspiracy hasn't hit Nebraska yet. Thank you Strategic Air Command for keeping our chickens safe. Come on Teakwoods. Let's do the math. A pound of wings is between 7-12 wings. The cost of a pound of wings has gone up, according to the WSJ, by .58 a pound. Yet to recoup your \"costs\" you add a surcharge of $3. Nice little additional profit, bad idea."}
{"text":"I was part of a large group.  I food and service were ok.  I thought it was odd that you can just throw peanut shells on the floor.  

My wife and I shared a burger, kid got hotdog sliders and we also got cheese curds.

I don't think it's really fair to rate an experience when part of a group."}
{"text":"Not as good as I remember but still good. We go for the wings. but do the math, we ordered 18 wings and could have gotten 24 wings for almost the same price if we had just looked at the pricing on the menu. We liked the wings that we got I've been happy with the Jefe and Jess Jess Wings and I was not as impressed with the Thai wings or the honey hot. We have found other places we enjoy with a similar theme but maybe we'll go here again for certain occasions."}
{"text":"Stupendously friendly and accommodating staff. We asked if they can turn on the live presidential debate on one of their many flat screen HD TVs and they didn't hesitate. The chicken wings were fresh and crispy, and blended well with the medium Buffalo and honey BBQ sauces. The tater tots and shoestring fries were also fresh, crispy and delicious. We will come back!"}
{"text":"Service is great, food is delicious and vibe is exciting. Been here a few times and always a great experience. Only reason not a five is because the wings could be better. Kids love the food and the fact that we can throw peanut shells on the floor."}
{"text":"Around the corner local place. Very casual and friendly. You get to throw your peanut shells on the floor. Food is good for bar food and they have music on some weekends. I would rather go for entertainment and drink then the food."}
{"text":"We have been regulars at Teakwoods for more than 18 years.  Can't beat their wings.  Best in town hands down.

Unfortunately, their prices have gotten high and the quality of their other food isn't the same as in years past.  My favorite was always Wednesday night soup with their Chicken Enchilada Soup, but they have changed it somehow.  Won't even order it again.  They also changed their seating and the high top chairs are very uncomfortable.  Feel like you are tipped and slipping down.

We used to go at least 1 once a week and now maybe once every other month."}
{"text":"Delicious as always!  Great sauces for the wings, especially El Hefe and Jess Jess.  Daily drink specials and multiple  food specials that change daily."}
{"text":"I honestly was not impressed with their award winning wings. They were too small, barely covered in sauce, and even the sauce was nothing impressive. The bad tasting ice over powered the flavor of my sons Shirley temple. But service was great, environment was fun, lots of different shows on the tv's. I could see coming here for drinks with the crew would be fun here :)"}
{"text":"3 stars because we are frequent customers.  Would have been 5 but tonight we had Kelsie (server 164) as our waitress and she was not a good representative for Teakwoods.  Waited for at least 10 minuted before she came to the table after we were seated.  She wasn't friendly and seemed impatient.  Took a bit to get 1 draft beer and a hack & coke(on special).  Got food which is always great here ( see 3 stars).  Another round of drinks and then she took our plates and brought the bill w/out asking us if we wanted anything else.  Waited at least 10 more minutes to see if we could get another drink and she had disappeared.  Finally asked hostess to take our bill.  Kelsie must be interested in vacating the premises.  Sorry for trying to enjoy Teakwoods on a Friday night.  It wasn't even 10 when we left.  :("}
{"text":"One of the better sports bars if the food is important. The TVs could be bigger and more of them. It's a nice sports bar if you want to hang with friends, eat and have a drink. Not the best place if you are primarily interested in watching the game. Causal, sports bar ambiance. Every table does have peanuts and the shells cover the floor."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised!
Portions were super generous,the service was nice, the drinks were great and we even made it to the happy hour. We bought another Groupon because this one is a gem!"}
{"text":"Really like Teakwoods. Blood Mary's excellent. Food very good. Cleanliness not so good. Patio is nasty. Needs a good power wash. Tv's dirty. Patio needs a complete cleaning. Lazy or don't care management?"}
{"text":"When they say they have the best wings, they are not lying.  Great hole in the wall feel and one of the last places I know of that you can still throw your peanuts on the floor (that being said, this place is still uber clean).  Still have to make it in here for happy hour, great prices!"}
{"text":"The wings were great. The El heffe wings were seasoned in a mild spicy sauce with garlic and cilantro. We also got the the cactus wings that weren't bad, but the El Heffe wings were the better choice. **Recommended**

We ordered a burger (El Diablo) it had jalepenos, pepper jack cheese and I added guacamole with it. It was good, I ordered it medium, it was a little more pink than I expected but it was still good.

And lastly the Tex mex salad, was also tasty. It came with guacamole and some chips as well! 

 A great place to stop in for lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"my fiance and i probably frequent teakwood about once a month, and they have the best wings in town. they are grilled after cooking which is almost a bonus in my book, they have many different variations of flavors etc and on tuesdays they run a special on wings. everyday they have a specials menu which in my opinion is the menu to eat from once. i had the some burro most recently and it was probably the best thing ive had there. definitely a must visit."}
{"text":"There is just not one single thing on the Menu that isn't Delicious.  Great portions, great employees, great sports bar neighborhood grill but with Amazing Food!"}
{"text":"Omg wings. Nice dive bar,  friendly waitress but mostly wings. So good I got some to go!"}
{"text":"OMG the philly cheesesteak and onion rings were awesome HOT as in temperature, the waitress was fast, we were on our lunch hour in and out less than 50 minutes, I would definately go back. Streets of New York is right next door, now i know why they are ALWAYS empty, when you have GREAT FOOD like this at Teakwoods."}
{"text":"In one sentence:  If you're looking for peanuts-on-the-floor casual, lots of TV's covering every major sport (quietly) with home-cooked bar-type food that obviously didn't come out of a box off the Sysco truck, this is your place.

Mashed potatoes:  Real.  Gravy:  home made.   Onion rings:  Freshly battered.  French dip sandwich:  Best we've had in years.   Beer:  Cold, fresh, and local.   Service:  Friendly and attentive.  Prices:  Reasonable.  Atmosphere:  Casual, borderline boisterous for dinnertime on a Thursday.   Kid-friendly:  Yes, but you'll probably be seated in the side room if you have them with you.  I'm fine with that.

This is a good place and doesn't reek of \"chain\".  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Don't know how I missed this place but I had never been here in all the years I've been going to the ABC store across the street.  Amazing.  So hit this place up during the USA-Canada Gold Medal game and was surprised at how large it is.  It is really two places in one...a Tavern AND a Grill - just like the name implies.  So we sat on the restaurant side and had pretty great service.  They had a ton of stuff on the menu that looked good but I went with the Take Em All burger or something like that.  It had chilies and avacados and bacon and all sorts of cheese.  It was pretty intense.  It was cooked exactly how I like it and the curly fries were pretty excellent too. 

This place is actually really awesome and I'm going to be looking at coming by on a Tuesday night to try their cheap wings.  Who's comin with me?

(Oh, I didn't give them 5 stars because they have Pepsi and because there are peanuts in a bucket on the table and peanut shells on the ground. That means I cannot bring my friends with peanut allergies here which sucks.)"}
{"text":"I too, have been a customer of Teakwoods for 15 years or more.  I used to frequent the restaurant more often before the gang shooting at the establishment in 2007.  First off, you cannot beat shelled peanuts that you are allowed to throw on the floor...I've always thought that was very cool.  The food has changed over the years, but they still do some pretty great bar and grill grub.  Their shoestring fries with hot cheese is to die for.  So are their wings, onion rings, fried zucchini, soft baked pretzels, and Chicken Jack (Not Jill) sandwiches. The atmosphere has changed over the years, as well as the service and attitude.  It's kind of hit or miss now.  You might get both great food and service, but it's a 50-50 shot that the service or food might be sub par.  I still love the place for nostalgic purposes, but it's changed quite a bit through the years."}
{"text":"Been eating at this place for over 15 years, regularly... some of the older employees recognize us... and then we get this jerk for a manager. For 15 years on and off I order and they make chicken or beef tacos for me al a carte. So, I order them like usual and the mgr. comes over and says I won't make them for you, not on the menu. OK... I say, just put some ground beef in a tortilla and I am good. He says no! I am so frustrated! This was my favorite dive bar and now, on principle, I refuse to go back. I asked the manager if I could speak to the owner and he said no... boy, I wonder how much business this jerk has lost / is losing for this poor owner!"}
{"text":"Teakwoods has a great atmosphere with plenty of TVs around the place; wings and cheese curds seem to be among the favorite appetizers. And everyone loves the bucket of peanuts on the table and being able to throw shells on the floor without being scolded. Some of the best hot wings that I have ever had...and they always have cold, local beer on tap."}
{"text":"Here is their website where you can view the menu: http://www.teakwoodstavern.com/
 
We went here because my hubby was craving hot wings and I seen all the good reviews for this place. He ordered the insanity wings and they were some of the hottest he has ever ate and he loved them! We also got the fried zucchini, was was excellent. I got the candlestick carver sandwich and loved it. It was basically a french dip on sourdough with horseradish and green chili made with prime rib and melted cheese.....2 die 4! We will definitely go again for some good grub and brews."}
{"text":"Why are the wings smaller???? They used to have the meatiest juiciest wings in town.
Last visit they were small and one of my dozen was smaller than my little finger (I have small hands) it had no business being on my plate.  When your reputation is based on the  quality of your wings, theory is if it is not broken do not fix it!!"}
{"text":"If you're a huge sports person, go here. It's loud and lots of tvs.  Wings are decent. But that's about it. Typical bar food. Just ok service."}
{"text":"i love throwing shit on the floor that I dont have to pick up!!! i could do without the peanuts, but i eat them just so i can throw the shell on the floor( don't judge me!) anyway.. alright beer selection on tap although there is more of a selection that comes bottled. 

The BLT i had was one of the best i have ever had, they let me add and substitute whatever i wanted. It was just delicious -seriously. Lover enjoyed his burger as well and we both loved the Greek fries!

nice cool dimly lit place to escape the wonderful 112 degree heat. somehow i always \"forget\" drinking makes me hotter..but meh, who cares"}
{"text":"Bought a Living Social deal for the Teakwood Tavern & Grill. My wife and I went there for lunch on a Saturday. The beer is cold, peanuts delish and the Ruben tasty. We liked it so much; I recently saw a Groupon come out and purchased it. Looks like another trip for lunch and a couple cold ones."}
{"text":"This Teakwoods is close to my work, so we come here every so often as a group from work.  I usually get a burger or a chicken sandwich.  Very good food.  I love the sweet potato fries.  The jalapeno dipping sauce for them is great.  Their onion rings are also excellent as well.  I also really like their BBQ sauce, so my chicken sandwich is usually the BBQ one.

I like the bucket of peanuts at the table to snack on.  Good bar food, nice atmosphere.  It does get loud for lunch, and the service is slow because it is usually so busy, so don't expect to get in and out of there quickly."}
{"text":"In our ever running quest to find a great wings place in the Phoenix area, my boyfriend and I stumbled upon Teakwoods.  We've been there a couple of times, and we've really enjoyed the overall experience on each of our visits.  First let me comment on how wonderful the service was.  It's a very laid back atmosphere, and the servers are all down to earth and easy to talk to and ask any questions.

I'm not a big fan of super spicy food, so I went with the Jess Jess wings.  A-MAZING.  I absolutely love them - they are fried then grilled, with bleu cheese crumbles to give them that extra bit of zing.  Very tasty.  My boyfriend went with the El Hefe (I hope I spelled that right...) wings, all suicide sauce instead of the mild with a dash of suicide like it states on the menu.  What a crazy fool.  However, he claims they aren't THAT spicy, and when he finally convinced me to try them, I didn't combust right on the spot.  So, for me they were just fine and a bit too spicy, but for someone who is looking for a really spicy wing, I don't think this would satisfy.  

We also had their potato skins, and they were just meh.  However, they do give you a nice big side salad if you order one, and they are reasonably priced.  They also have peanuts on every table, so if you are inclined to throw shells on the floor and make an incredible mess for the waitstaff at the end of the night, well, you have that option ;).

This is a good place to go for wings, and I'm sure we'll be back in the future."}
{"text":"My friend raved about this place and she was not lying! Great affordable beer choices as well as an extensive and most likely amazing menu! We had the pretzels and cheese which were delish (& pro tip from the manager to add jalapaños next time! ) boneless wings and the carver (I believe was the name) sandwhich. We have lots of leftovers that I am looking forward to eating!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Teakwoods a few times for happy hour and for lunch / dinner. The service is always great the food isn't anything to really rave about. The atmosphere is kind of uninviting it's dark and has peanut shells all over the place and I almost slipped on some once and I imagine after a couple drinks even though you may not feel the fall it's still not something I want to worry about. Anyway the service is nice and the food is reasonably priced  and it's in a pretty good location."}
{"text":"We picked up a Groupon for Teakwood since it's close to home and we hadn't tried it yet. We had cheese curds and hot pretzels for appetizers and I got a salad and my husband had a burger. I had a very long week and asked our server for a drink recommendation... Something strong. He recommended a long island iced tea -sold! It was delicious and just right. My husband had a couple beers. The service was excellent and we really enjoyed everything we had. We will definitely be going there many more times."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I was looking for a french dip sandwich and this was one of the few places in Gilbert that had one on the menu. When i entered i was not greeted, i made my way back to the patio area and still was not greeted. I had to find a waiter to ask if it was open seating. I sat in the patio area which was filthy, the patio really needs to be power washed because its gross. I ordered the french dip and fries. When it arrived it was plated ok and was of decent size. However the flavor was bland and so was the au jus. The steak fries had an odd after taste like the frier oil needed to be changed. I was never asked once how my meal was which is sad. The waitress was tentative however in refreshing my beverage. you figure for a 14 dollar tab for a sandwich and a drink you would get better quality. If your looking for a good sandwich go else where. Too expensive for what you get. I really dont mind paying 15 for a sandwich if its really good. Basically it was a very expensive Arbys. Wont be back."}
{"text":"We hadn't gone back in a couple of years. I got a Groupon deal, pay $15 for $30 of food. Why not?  Service was excellent, our waitress was extremely attentive and proactive.  We ordered a raspberry iced tea and a lemonade. $2.95 each, free refills. Cups are 32oz. We had the mozzarella stick with marinara sauce at $8.99. Overpriced for what they are. Tasted fine but l think the Gilbert location does a better job than this one in Chandler.  Next l had the fish taco.  It consisted in small nuggets of fried fish topped with a pick de Gallo, shredded red cabbage. Tacos were lined by two corn tortillas each.  The bean dip tasted very good and it was my favorite part of the meal. I ate part of it, left the excessive amount of corn tortilla and foufou chips. I disliked those little fish nuggets, they reminded me of dry dog food, round and brown.   Ron had the chicken macmac, shredded chicken in penne pasta topped with cheese sauce. He ate it but left half of it and didn't ask for a to go box, it wasn't the kind of food worth eating twice."}
{"text":"A co-worker noticed Teakwood's was open for business a couple of weeks ago and suggested we go try it out for lunch.  So today we got a group of four together and off we went.  First impression was this is a nice little sports bar.  Think Applebee's meets Lonestar and you've got yourself a pretty good idea of what Teakwood's is like.  Teakwood's has plenty of booths, tables, a bar, and some groovy crescent shaped loveseats with bistro tables on one side of the room.  There's also an arcade on the east end.  There were probably a dozen or so TV's with different sporting events playing.  

The service was prompt, the menu was typical bar and grill fare.  Buckets of peanuts on the table and we were instructed to leave our hulls on the floor.  We all got chicken sandwiches.  Three of which were buffalo style with varying degrees of \"hotness\".  I got the Hot and it was spicy, but not overly so.  The interesting thing is they grill the chicken breast and then bring you the wing sauce on the side.  I guess it's healthier than a fried crispy sandwich.  I also ordered tater tots as my side as did one other person, one of us had fruit and the other had fries.    All in all we were all satisfied with our meals.  The portion sizes were large and the drinks were in monster plastic cups.  I almost asked for a to-go cup, but I got up to wash my hands and my tea was gone when I came back.  The total for a sandwich and an iced tea came to $12.71.  We're looking forward to going back to try some of their other lunch items."}
{"text":"Thank you for putting a new Teakwoods in Phoenix. Teakwoods goes above & beyond regular bar food - but I come here for the chicken wings.

BOTTOM LINE: Best wings in the valley, hands down"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place got such good reviews. It's basically a dank bar with peanuts on the floor. We got an order of fries with some hot wings, the fries tasted stale like they were sitting under a hot lamp for hours and the wings were dry and over breaded, I hardly could taste the chicken in them. Long story short this place isn't anything special, don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Went here today ( Sunday) for lunch! I have eaten here before and it's usually a decent experience all around. However, I don't suggest coming here on Sunday. The service was incredibly slow. They very obviously are understaffed or at the very least have incredibly stupid sections. Our poor server was running around like crazy and didn't have a moment to check on us or refill our drinks, or even run our food. I had to hunt her down at a computer to get things we needed and she was frazzled. Again, I don't blame her. Place was packed.. But where the hell was management to help? Why didn't they have more servers? Oh.. Right. Management was on the food line on their phones. Help your staff out managers!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! We live right around the corner from one and I could go there everyday. I've had a lot of items on there menu and I have enjoyed each and every dish. The service is outstanding and I enjoy the selection they have for beverages. I'm a beer girl so I was pleased when I found out that they carry a nice variety on tap as well as seasonal shipments. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone, whether you go with your family or you go to watch the game with friends because it is awesome. If you like peanuts, they are available at your table and you can just throw the shell on the ground."}
{"text":"The El Heffe Wings (boneless please) are the thing to eat here. Ask for a dipping side of Suicide sauce, an icy cold beer and you have the recipe for one great evening."}
{"text":"Best honey hot wings in town. Bummed that they shuttered the one down the road from my house (not sad that it became the Angry Crab shack, though!) but thank goodness the East Valley location is still open."}
{"text":"As anticipated, the wings were incredible! I love that you have the option to finish them on the grill. I had the honey BBQ hot sauce and just loved it! Soft pretzels and cheese curds were also great! The atmosphere was relaxed and casual, they are great for groups as well! I think the one disappointment for my husband was their lack of craft beers on tap. They mostly had big name brands on tap and a lot of the crafts they had in cans they were sold out of. Not a deal breaker, we'll definitely be back! Just be aware if you prefer craft and local beers!"}
{"text":"I knew nothing about this place, and went with a friend. The best thing was the service. Our server was awesome. The perfect balance of friendly and professional. She kept our beverages filled, and gave perfect menu suggestions. 

I had the chuck burger. The meat was moist and flavorful and cooked perfectly. My friend had the veggie lavosh with wing sauce on the side for dipping (our server's suggestion). My friend thought it was the bomb.

We also had the fried zucchini. Not super special,  but nice large slices, well seasoned,  not overly salty, served with above-average ranch. 

Their menu is extensive,  I'd love to go back and try other things. Especially if the service is always this great!"}
{"text":"The soft pretzel appetizers are the best thing on the menu, but the wings are awesome too. Try the El Jefe flavor. The  service isn't always up to par, but I wouldn't expect it from a place like that. Shrugs. It's not a place for fine dining and great service, it's for beer and wings."}
{"text":"Just went for the first time...I was on a wing mission and Yelp led me here. It is definitely a sports bar with a lot of TVs and from what I could tell a GB fan base. Yes, peanut shells litter 
the floor and it was loud so consider this more bar than restaurant. I got a dozen wings, half HOT, half Jess Jess. They were cooked perfectly and had great taste. I also had a decent bloody which was only $3.50 on Sunday's so thats another win. The gal next to me at the bar had breakfast @2:30 in the afternoon so I guess they serve it all day? So if your looking for that sports bar atmosphere and some wings etc give 'em a try."}
{"text":"Our waiter was awesome, the place was comfortable but run down a little. Burgers were huge, tasty, and delicious. The string frys we had were crisp, fresh and hot. The wings were awesome the soft pretzel was really, really good. And everything came out super fast! Good beer selection. A really good all around place. And we are picky people:) it was a little pricey, but well worth the good food and atmosphere"}
{"text":"THE standard for wings in Arizona, in my opinion.
Teaks cooks their wings to order, has great creative flavors - Jess Jess, El Jeffe, etc., and the staff is always prompt with great service. A well oiled, well run machine.
The bar staff is fantastic, my wife and I are 'regulars'. They know us by name, have our drink in our hands within minutes if not seconds.
The only drawback is the noise, crowd, lack of bar seeting and the bloody screaming kids parents tend to let run around earlier in the evening...
We time our visits better now to eliminate these factors and can't wait to go back again.
They are in S.Gilbert and WORTH THE DRIVE! 
They free pour so have a DD."}
{"text":"LOVE Teakwoods!  If you like wings, try the el jefe wings.  I get them with hot buffalo sauce instead of the mild, and I get them re-dipped after they're been grilled.  YUM! Their burgers are good too--I always get the patty melt. Delicious.  The vibe is relaxed, and it is a great place to hang out with friends.  Make sure to check out the daily menu--there is always something new!"}
{"text":"Portions: Huge
Service: Top Notch
Atmosphere: Awesome for loud groups and families

This place is a great basic restaurant for groups and families. It lies in the old Vine/McKenna's Tavern location, and while the decor isn't anything fancy, the service was fabulous and the food was really good and large portions. 

So some of their TVs are old school, who cares. They have great drink prices and daily specials as well as plenty of flat screens. They were really good accommodating all my food allergies and they serve cider, so I'm a happy camper. 

And, I love the fact that I can toss my peanuts on the floor and make a major mess with my 2 year old without anyone giving me the stink eye."}
{"text":", we have been coming here for years! Can't go wrong with the food! Never a bad meal, and if they mess up they make it right! Our server (Julie) she's new and she was awesome! Thanks Julie and teaks for a good dinner and top notch service every time!!!"}
{"text":"Go on a Friday, get the fish tacos!!! I love ALL Of THE FOOD HERE!!!  My hubby and I try something new every time we go and we have never been disappointed.  I just wish they had the fish tacos during the week... you can also go on group on and get like$32 worth of food for just 16$;) awesome! 

Kid friendly too!!! We never wait long- and if it's too packed we just sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Hubby and I are visiting AZ and decided to hit up our fav wing place. Delicious wings but disappointed with the price which included a wing surcharge which was not listed on the menu or disclosed until the bill arrived. Unethical and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"We recently used Teakwoods to cater a large family event. Everything was fantastic...people are still asking us where the food came from!

Everything was just getting packed up when we arrived for pick up, so it was hot and fresh. They also had all sauces and dressings on the side so things wouldn't get soggy. 

There was plenty of food to go around and not only were our guests satisfied, but so were we! Thanks Teakwoods catering!"}
{"text":"This place scores points for being great at what it sets out to do:  it's a family-friendly sports bar. Loud. Casual. Fun.

We were here from out of town, and because we were there with our 11-year old son, they sat us in what seemed to be the \"family\" room adjacent to the main bar area; fine. The entire place seemed to be the choice for the local crowd, and the family room was jammed with parents toting small kids. It makes sense, given that young adults have few places they can really go out and take the kiddos. Everybody seemed to feel at home with toddlers running about, crunching peanut shells under their feet. Don't take this description as a derision; it just is what it is. If you're looking for a roantic dinner choice with your SO, this may not be the place.  

Everybody enjoyed their meals, and the staff might be the most attentive I have ever experienced. Try their take on macaroni and cheese, it's amazing."}
{"text":"Best wings ever. I don't eat chicken but I'll still eat Teakwoods wings. The cheese curds are unreal (get them with a side of hot sauce). Burgers, phillys, etc are delicious. As is the Mac and cheese. We're here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Today was the first time (and the last, for the foreseeable future) that I've eaten here. when i called in my order, the receptionist was rude; she acted as though she was doing me a favor by taking my order. once i finally got my food, the fries were cold and limp and just really gross. my turkey sandwich was on the gross side as well, with soggy bread and warm lettuce... not good. the only saving grace was the chicken enchilada soup... that was downright heavenly. everything else, however, was dang near inedible."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Teakwoods is your favorite neighborhood bar, stocked with peanut buckets on the tables, peanut shells on the floor and big flat screen TVs all around.  Tuesdays are my favorite day to go because you can get a dozen wings for only $6.50 ( I think regular price is $8.50 for a dozen).  I always order the same items:  pretzels and cheese, soy and garlic edamame, a dozen jess jess wings and a prickly pear margarita.  

The pretzels are always warm and soft, and come with a yummy and creamy cheese sauce.  The soy and garlic edamame are the BOMB!  Completely delish!  The jess jess wings are hands down the best wings I've had anywhere!  And the prickly pear margaritas are the perfect accent to my meal -- sweet and delish, with just a little tartness.  

The place is very laid back, and they even have karaoke on Friday nights (I think -- I've only been to karaoke once).  This is a great place to go with a group of friends for a casual and fun evening with good food and drinks."}
{"text":"So my wife is on another groupon kick. Usually the places on groupon suck because they are trying anything to get people in the door. When i heard we had a groupon to teakwoods, i was skeptical because i had never heard of the place and live fairly close to it.

Long story short i was incredibly impressed. The atmosphere, service and food was all awesome. The sodas are nice and big and my wifes burger made me jealous. My kids loved the pretzel appetizer and my honey bbq tenders were delicious. I cant wait to come back."}
{"text":"Midwest-centric Teakwoods is an amazing bar-food destination. Large beers, cheese curds, and your entree of choice make this a fantastic place for breakfast, lunch or dinner. The service has been flawless the 20+ times I have been there. It may not be in the heart of the Gilbert \"Scene,\" but when you want good food, and a good time without the wait, head to Teakwoods."}
{"text":"I'm giving them 4 stars for their wings and the convenient fact that my family of 5 can go and all get something we like. IMO they have the best wings in the valley.  Service could be a little more efficient but they are all so nice that it doesn't take away too much from the overall experience. We go back a whole lot."}
{"text":"First time there. Had the chop chop salad with grilled chicken. Salad was more julienne sliced thin. Thought it would be large chopped pieces. Grilled chicken was tasty! Service was friendly and consistent thru the meal. They even asked if we wanted drinks to go which I liked a lot. Kind of lid inside since it's a bar/restaurant combined on an open setting, with TV's all around."}
{"text":"Classic pub grub. Nothing special. Fried zucchini appetizer was clearly frozen and just heated; bland and without any flavor. The Mediterranean quesilliadia was small and with minimal amount of ingredients. Flavor nothing to brag about. Service was slow at a non busy time. Lack of staff was evident. 
Wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Went to Teakwoods with my family.  My kids love their wings there.   My daughter had El Jeffe, my nephew had the El Diablo burger, and I had a Cobb salad.  Food was very good as usual.  They make the best wings and salads.  Service was good!  Definetly will be back."}
{"text":"Love that we are in walking distance to Teakwoods! Great live music couple nights a week, never a cover, awesome waitstaff, and consistently solid grub! Try the pretzels and cheese, out of sight!"}
{"text":"Live right down the street and have eaten maybe a dozen times - service is fair - no one shows a passion for people - free peanuts is great - drinks are average - prices average - lots of tvs for sports - small outside patio with lots of traffic"}
{"text":"Great BLT good atmosphere prompt service. The peanuts there are usually stay although yuck"}
{"text":"From start to finish it was all good.  Would totally come back.  Try the Pretzel bites.Best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great happy Hour!  Pretzels and fried pickles were great!!  Service was great.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Like Glenn said, I'm pretty surprised that we've never been here until now.  We've made numerous trips to ABC Cake Decorating across the street and many of them were tainted with hunger.  It's just surprising to me that we never even noticed the cool place across the street!

We finally came the other day, and I quite enjoyed my experience.  The place is pretty big with a lounge/seating on the west side, a bar in the middle, and lots more seating on the east side.  My only real frustration with the restaurant is the peanut shells on the floor and the bucket of peanuts on the table.  I really dislike that, but since I'm not allergic or anything, I'll live.

The service was nice and friendly, and the food comes out pretty quickly.  I got the Southern Thang Burger.  Basically, it's a burger covered in yummy BBQ sauce, cheese, and crispy onions.  Yay!  I love crispy onions.  You have 5 or so options for your side including various interpretations on potatoes and I even think cottage cheese.  I chose the tots because I love tots.  My burger was pretty tasty and the tots were great.  I am definitely ready to come back here again.  It seems like a fun place to watch a game and grab some great food."}
{"text":"Update: The veggie burger is really good. You can get the 'Garden Burger', which is really tasty with the cucumbers and mayo. You can also substitute the veggie burger for any of the other burgers and even build your own. I love the veggie burger with provolone, jalapenos, mushrooms, and a slice of tomato. 

Also, if you're a fat vegetarian like me, another good option is the grilled cheese. Just get it without bacon. The fried tomato on the sandwich is perfection. I've also ordered it with fried jalapenos, but that's not a guarantee that you'll get that. Depends on the day/situation.

Still, while they do have some good beer, they really need a deeper craft brew selection on tap."}
