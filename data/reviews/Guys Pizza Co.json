{"text":"Food was Good - that is where they get the two star rating. Everything else, a lack of communication and caring. First off, I understand that this a business, I get that. I really do. But when a company puts in a large order online, one would think that there will be checks and double checks prior to someone coming to pick up the order. This was not done. A part of the order was incorrect, some of it was missing. (I know that I am not entirely blameless, but before I left the restaurant, I asked and was reassured that I had a complete order.) Called the restaurant back with my issue, wait time was long (but I was calling at the end of a peak time, no fault there) and it will be delivered.  Ok, cool. 2 hours and 4 calls later, I found out that they did try to deliver the missing order, wrote the number down wrong to contact me. The Rep on the phone told me that the missing order was the left at the front desk - that was a lie, The Delivery Driver took it and left.  When I called, I was told that there was a shift change; they have no idea what is going on and hung up. At that point, I believe that we will not be ordering from this establishment in the future.   TL:DR - If you place a large order from this restaurant, don't. Save yourself the trouble and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Wanna hear a riddle? Ever notice how every one who eats at guys is drunk?   You give? Because had they been sober they would notice the blend taste of cardboard overwhelming their delectable palates. It s passable at best. But recently they've outdone themselves. I somehow managed to get ill eating that stuff. I ve never gotten food poisoning from pizza before. This was a first."}
{"text":"I will never, ever order from this place again. I would sooner eat a damn frozen Tombstone than give them another cent.  There have been at least 3 occasion the drivers don't have change and get themselves a hefty tip from me (or I look like a jerk for not tipping).  We've had cold pizza  and wrong pizza from them as well. But tonight was the last straw. Ordered online (so MAYBE the order would be right), waited nearly two hours and called. I received confirmation, the website shows record of my order, but they don't have it. The girl on the phone tells me she checked, her manager checked but there's no record of it and asks \"you just want to place a phone order?\" No...no I do not. And the least she could have done was given me a half hearted \"I'm sorry\". I'm sure I'll have to fight with my credit card company on this one."}
{"text":"Not so good, but I do like to get a slice or two after shows at the Grog Shop. Convenience is its best quality. Don't order online as they didn't start making either of my orders the times I did so until I got there 30 minutes later."}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriend. She actually wrote the review below mine. But she sneakily took my opinion and made it her own :) ... specifically the \"1 for the pizza. 2 for being open really late right next to the Hyatt\" part."}
{"text":"A decent pizza place. Is it the best pizza? No. Is it the cheapest? No. Is it the best mix of the two? Very likely. More times than not, I order a few slices of cheese. They have 3 slices of pizza and a can of pop for $5. I have tried their Guyzone and they are good as well. They are open later than most take-out places Downtown and have saved me from fast food on many occasions."}
{"text":"I used to order and enjoy Guys pizza, but I will not be ordering it any longer.  We ordered the Texas BBQ pizza, like we had done many times before, and it arrived and was like a pile of slop. You could not even pick up the pieces to put on a plate the entire dough/crust would just fall apart and the cuts were all over the place.   I emailed to the email listed on their website letting them know about the bad experience and included pictures and have not received a response.   Just thought I would share my recent experience, so it does not happen to others hopefully."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the bad press is about, this location has better pizza than the one at kent state, which was ok on my book. Delivery is almost always sooner than expected."}
{"text":"The Chicken Parm sub was unreal for a pizza joint."}
{"text":"I like guys. But when you say you're delivery time is 1.5 hours (ridiculous) and you don't deliver it for 3 hours. That's absolutely unacceptable. Won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Good pizza and at a decent price. I have ordered pizza at the Medina location a few times. The scicilian chicken wrap is always a good bet as well."}
{"text":"Just fat bread with little cheese and few ingredients. Don't bother. Marginal flavor sauce."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok, in line with a few of the other Medina pizza places.  Toppings were fresh and the sauce was on the sweeter side.  Placed order over the phone and it was ready when they said it would be.  The staff was friendly.  Due to the amount of pizza choices and this one being a little further from us, probably will not go here again ."}
{"text":"The pizza isn't too bad but I am giving it two stars because the delivery is soooo slow.  They always say 45 minutes to an hour but I am usually waiting about 1:15.  The only reason Guys exists is because it is in a competition vacuum aka East Cleveland."}
{"text":"After not ordering from here for a while. Tonight I decided to give it another try. Unfortunately, that was a mistake I will never repeat. I ordered a cowboy burger and Smore's desert. I got my burger and it was smothered in cole slaw. The app menu / mobile site DOES NOT say cole slaw is a topping. Being allergic to egg this is not an option for me. If I had known I would have made a special request without.  Upon calling I was belittled, argued with and told I was wrong. All I tried to explain was the situation - in a calm, polite, respectful way without this employee going off on me! I was cut off and placed on hold.  A manager, or somebody more with better temperament gets on and offers to send another out. Great, problem solved..... Then, I open the Smore's they are burnt to a black on the bottom! At this point I just don't have the courage to call back. Live and Learn    I've uploaded 2 pics - one of the menu description not indicating cole slaw and other the burned Smore's."}
{"text":"It's okay for a quick bite to eat if you're on the go and happen to be near one, but it's not something you'd actively seek out. That said the downtown locations staff come across as rude or extremely introverted/quiet. I haven't decided which one it is yet, anyhow for $1.50 a slice of quick pizza, it;s alright."}
{"text":"incompetent, last straw as this isn't the first time I've had bad experience here. Maybe they wouldn't mess up orders if they wrote down what the order was on the box. Called back as soon as we opened the box to see both items incorrect (about 5 minutes after we picked it up) and the manager is MIA (and supposed to call us back immediately) so they can't help me until he returns (uh how about you remake the order correctly as the course of action?) so I wait around for the manager to magically reappear and call me since I have no food or order presently and yeh he's there but hasn't called. (I could have placed another order and picked up again in the time I waited) He takes a few incorrect guesses at my order before I just have to say, can you rush my ticket so I can get my order?  Nearly left without the sauces included but I insisted on checking the order before leaving pickup #2."}
{"text":"After a long day of sight-seeing in Cleveland, we went back to our hotel at the Doubletree downtown.  The kids wanted to go swimming so I ordered a pizza from Guys (one of the two places that delivered) and they said it would be delivered in about 60 minutes. Perfect about of time to swim and then eat!  Well, the pizza was actually delivered in 45 minutes and the delivery driver was calling my phone but.... yep, I was swimming with the kids and missed the call.  He was nice enough to leave it with the front desk where the properly secured my pizza.  So, for my review: the pizza was hot (still!) and cheesy.  Half pepperoni and half cheese to accomodate the kids.  I forgot how good plain pizza tastes!!  Give it a try...."}
{"text":"WORST Guys pizza location. Put ham on my pizza, and I do not eat pork, and that was not what I asked for. Then I specified again what I wanted and also that I wanted it double stoned(well done) Maybe they were double stoned bc they gave me a barely cooked pizza and to top it all off it wasn't even cut.. Just a undercooked uncut pie.. Never going here again.. If you're smart, neither would you"}
{"text":"Pretty solid pizza. Definitely worth a try, really good cheese. Delivery guys tried to bum cigs off me which I didn't like but pizza is good and I guess that's all that matters"}
{"text":"I will NEVER give this place my money EVER again! My order took ONE hour AND FORTY  MINUTES to get to me. When I called at the hour mark for an eta, I got no apologies and no explanation.  The guy was rude and dismissive, telling me they're not tracking their drivers gps coordinates,  all he can tell me is that it's on its way. The burger I ordered showed up with no lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mustard,  no mayo. Just two dry beef patties with cheese stuck between them. I called again and the guy wanted to argue with me about what type of cheese it was! Once I clarified that the cheese type was besides the point, he put another douche bag on the phone who talked over me, accused me of cursing and then hung up on me! I havent used explatives since 1998! When I called back,  he said he wasn't required to do business with me, and hung up on me a second time! I called again amd he picked up and hung up on me a third time! So I drove down there with their second rate burger and demanded my money back! NEVER AGAIN! And if I were you, I'd put a frozen pizza in the oven before giving these people your money.  It's the same quality food as frozen anyway, spare yourself the horrible service.  Completely ruined my Sunday evening."}
{"text":"While in Cleveland for business this week, and staying at the Hyatt Regency a few doors down, I was looking for a nearby place to eat w/out sitting in a restaurant alone (preferably). And after walking back to the hotel from the office, I noticed Guys Pizza on the corner and decided to try it for dinner. Sooooo glad I did! The place on the inside doesn't look like much - rather small and less than quaint; but the food - excellent. I ordered a Deluxe 10\" w/ bacon and it tasted awesome - great sauce, thick crispy crust, smoky meat toppings - win win win. (They even make Italian subs among other \"quick\" foods [according to the menu], so in case you're not in the mood for pizza, you can try something else quick.) The price seemed a bit on the higher end for a downtown corner pie shop (I paid about 10 bucks for my 10\"), but after picking it up I was offered a 12-oz. soda to go with it, no extra charge. But since the food was great, and the proximity to the hotel was spot in, the price I considered well worth it, even w/out any extras.   So if you're willing to listen to a random tourist from a Southern state about pizza, I think Guys is worth a visit, especially if you're a downtown biz resident, temp or otherwise. Next I'm in the city and area again, I'll make it a point to hit Guys up one more time."}
{"text":"Same old dull pizza. Flat taste. Wasn't bad but wasn't great either. Just another boring Pizza. Service was great. The shop was cute like a pizza shop should be. But none of the smells of a real true blue pizzeria. Just tried something different. I wasnt completely let done. Ok for the cost. I was impressed on the sizes of pizza they carry."}
{"text":"I enjoy Guy's pizza each time I have it. It is very gooy, cheesy, and we'll priced. They also deliver beer."}
{"text":"I ordered a deep dish pizza to my hotel room last night and it was delicious. They were timely, and the delivery guy was friendly. All in all this was a super positive experience!"}
{"text":"I love your food. However, your delivery children suck. The last few times I've ordered, I've had to walk out of my apartment, through the courtyard, and even across the street a couple of times. Why am I paying a delivery charge if your delivery children are too entitled to get out of their cars and deliver the food to my door? Fix it. Thx."}
{"text":"Parma has got to be the \"Pizza Capital of the World\", as there seems to be a pizza shop on every corner, from chains to the mom & pop places that all fight for our hard-earned dollars.  With that being said, we decided to give this place a try.  We ordered a pepperoni pizza, stromboli, and a Chicago \"deep dish style\" pizza.  The pepperoni pizza was very average, nothing spectacular.  The calzone was 90% dough and 10% filings and the Chicago pie was very watery and soggy.  I'm not talking too much oil, but every slice, every bite was like biting into a water-logged sponge.  It seemed like they made the pizza and soaked it in a bucket before putting it in the box for my pick-up.  Very disappointed and nothing makes we want to ever go back and try them agian."}
{"text":"Working nearby, this is one of my go-to lunch spots. Sometimes I order pizza by the slice, $1.50 each, and they usually have plenty of options, toppings wise. Just an FYI, I come for pizza by the slice around noon. That is a busy time for them, which helps with the freshness. But, I'm not a huge fan of their pizza, lets talk guyzones... Made fresh to order, cheesy, they put an abundance of toppings, and at lunch their only $5, which includes a can of soda. I strongly suggest you give it a try. All my coworkers are addicted as well, even my boss: who doesn't even like greasy food. They are exceptionally good, just request it extra crispy. If not, their never hot enough."}
{"text":"I wanted to give Guys a 5, but that seems a bit much...all things considered. Read on.   Guys pizza is super tasty. Delicious, even. But only when you want a greasy, sloppy slice that'll give you heartburn that'll make you whimper. Well, that's my experience at least. Anyways, I really do enjoy the pizza here. I've never had a \"guyzone\" so I can't speak for them, and I've actually only had the individual slices of pizza, so heed my word carefully.   Also, MAJOR thing to note about Guys: the level of inebriation that all guests seem to be at. I've had Guys pizza 3 times. Two of which included alcohol and lots of it. And everyone else near or around the place was in the same state. The third time, we went on a Sunday for early dinner and there were some...ahem...inebriated young men to put it nicely, that made our experience, though awkward, something to laugh about.   I've never had a problem with service and I commend the people that work the late shifts and deal with huge crowds of obnoxious people craving some grease and cheese. Overall, I value Guys. Quick, cheap and tasty!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed their pizza since opening but customer service leaves little to be desired. I waited over an hour for a delivery, called the store and was told my order never came through from online correctly l. Instead of refunding the amount I paid and providing me with the pizza or even at a discounted price, I only received an offer for my pizza in another 30 minutes. I cancelled and called Marcos!!!!"}
{"text":"Lost my business  has progressively  gotten  worse  since the great first year they were there ... food undercooked or less than mediocre as well as orders that were messed up go to jets pizza right down the street there pizza is great and always consistant !!!"}
{"text":"Sooo, just tried calling around 2 hours before the Super Bowl. They said they aren't taking orders for pickup or delivery right now. Should a business really turn away customers? I like their food a lot but the customer service leaves a lot to be desired. I can't give any more stars."}
{"text":"Delivery is so damn slow, but honestly i was pleased with the pizza. A little on the salty side, but coming from NY.NJ area, it was good. also very reasonably priced, however, they dont have much choices to drink and like i said the delivery can take a bit slow. the cheesey bread is absolutely gross, but huge. like the size of the small pie, very odd--i was expecting bread sticks."}
{"text":"No public restroom??  Is that even legal for a dine-in restaurant?  I understand if it was pick up/delivery only but this place has booths and tables for people to dine in.  Not sure how that got past the health inspector.  I know this is a bit old fashioned but I wash my hands before I touch my food.    When I asked if there was a way to do that they pointed across the street and recommended I go to Marc's.  Ok as far as the food, I got a slice and a drink.  It was ok but not spectacular."}
{"text":"avoid!  got food poisoning from here.  and they wouldn't refund my money.  Jerks."}
{"text":"Guys is my absolute favorite pizza in Cleveland. It's also one of the only places to get late night food because apparently the Eastside has an aversion to eating after 11 pm or something (driving me crazy on the reg).   I'm a big fan of getting their giant New Yorker pizza and I have absolutely no justification for that. I eat one piece and I'm stuffed, but it's just so big that it barely fits in the car and I kinda think it's funny (maybe that's why I just can't help myself).  I'm also a big fan of the pizza by the slice. There's usually no wait and it's cheap.  Another great tidbit is that you can save the little coupons on the box lids and once you get 10, you get a free pizza!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this little spot while we were literally talking about how we could find a bodega. Not exactly that, but cheap and fast food out of a small window and big menu.   It seems that most of their business is delivery based, but this definitely got the job done on our hunt for pre-wedding digs!"}
{"text":"First time and will go back.  Had an issue ordering on line.  Called store.  They took the order and applied discount.  Pizza was better than average.  We had the boneless wings.  Didn't realize they are breaded.  We had the Cajun.  Hot.  They were good but hoping to avoid the calories.  Our daughter had the honey mustard.  Okay value even with a coupon.  But worth another try."}
{"text":"We're from Buffalo, so we're picky about our pizza and wings, but we needed something delivered to our hotel room after a baseball game one night, and not knowing the city we went with the first choice that was open and still delivering.  Honestly, not the best pizza/wings we've ever had- but it wasn't bad and they get major points for late night delivery!!   Also, first time using Yelp to order our delivery and was amazed at how quick and EASY, easy, easy it was! (and skeptical that it was even legit until the food actually arrived lol)!    If we were in Cleveland looking for delivery again, I'd definitely give them another shot- but I'm not sure I'd order the pizza again."}
{"text":"Go for the white sauce.  Great crust.  They also do good salads, and the guys fries too!"}
{"text":"AVOID ORDERING DELIVERY HERE!!!!!!!! They told me 2 hours (mind you,  It was a 5 min drive from this store) .. I said ok.. after 2  1/2 hour on a normal sat day .... I called and they gave me a sad story- that they were  down a driver,  I was so mad that i canceled the order.  I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM GUYS PIZZA EVER AGAIN!!! Really after 2 hours you can't deliver a pizza. WTF"}
{"text":"WAS THE PEPPERONI, PORK BELLY?? No, that was not a shot on your mom. No but really, the slices of pep were stinkin fresh! Unfortunately, this was a the best place I ate at this weekend. That's not a shot at Guys. It's a shot at Pizza. And your mom. :))  Legit wish I had a cup of milk today since its Martin Lither King day :)))  Good pizza, good smells. The smells are free but they're not dooshy like Jimmy Johns and advertise that fact. Yahoo! Yelp!**"}
{"text":"Well... You get what you pay for. I remember the last time I visited Guy's Pizza, right after moving into a new apartment, with no food to eat, and being so hungry and excited to have pizza! I watched as the woman behind the counter putting my slices of pizza in a box struggled beyond belief. She tried maybe 20 times to scoop up my 2 pieces of pepperoni into a to-go container. She did not give a ****. Eventually, when she \"succeeded\" all the pepperoni and cheese has completely separated from the pizza. The bottom of one pizza slice was completely stuck to the cheese and pepperoni of another slice. I ate the slop with a fork. It still tasted good, with lots of hot peppers. The first time we went here we ordered a pizza to go, and we were both starving so we wanted something quick. They told us they would let us know when our pizza was ready and somehow they forgot to give us our pizza for about 30-40 minutes after it was done!! There was no one else in the pizza shop. I don't know what they were doing all that time to not notice us sitting there waiting for so long and a pizza box behind their counter. When we got home it was cold, obviously. My husband really liked it. I actually really didn't. To be honest I think it's some of the worst pizza I have ever had. If I return it will be out of pure laziness. I think this place can improve and become awesome I they actually tries which is why I'm giving 2 stars I stead of 1."}
{"text":"This place honestly deserves 0 stars but it's not an option. The pizza tastes like cardboard and tears up your mouth. And yes I've given them more than 1 try, so yes they're consistently bad."}
{"text":"Oily wings, with oil drippping everywhere and even pizza bases were like they had been fried before. If this was not the only place open that late, I would have not gone in the first place"}
{"text":"Great when you've been drinking. The thin crust could be thinner for my taste, but if you're not into thin crust, their regular crust is good, as well. Eating this sober though just isn't as good, but that's just my opinion."}
{"text":"Highly Recommend Lakewood location if want your food sloppy and incorrect order downtown cleveland management  isnt bright at all"}
{"text":"This place is ok, through the process of ordering a variety of different things here my opinion:  Appetizers: not really that great the \"guys fries\" would be good at the restaurant but not for takeout. The fries all get soggy. The mozzarella sticks were ok.   Salads: they used to be good I would get the simple salad, but the price used to be 5.99 then I noticed today they are all 8.99 like lmao you gotta be kidding.  Pizza/Guyzones: Pizza was gross, ordered it once and never again, I stick to guyzones but these toppings are a \"no\": Feta cheese (they put in too much and it's like glue on the bottom) and salami, idk it's just gross there the same reason I didn't like the Italian sub..cheap lunch meat maybe. I had another sub that wasn't good either.  Dessert: I've only had the Smores and they are really good, sometimes cooked too long but it's usually just the edges BUT I order usually before a cavs game not late at night so the cook at 8pm may not be the same guy at 1:30am.  Delivery: sometimes it's slow so I order earlier, but other times it's about 30mins. If something is going on downtown you're going to wait. All the delivery guys have been cool."}
{"text":"Great Pizza, just make sure you order enough, it will go fast. Definitely recommend the Gyro Meat on the pizza with zesty pizza sauce."}
{"text":"I give this place a big \"MEH.\"  I've had their pizza at many events and have tried the plain cheese, veggie, and pepperoni.  All left me disappointed.  The crust is way too thick and doughy, which would be okay if they counterbalanced it with a healthy smattering of toppings, but they don't..  There's hardly any cheese and they skimp on the veggies.  The sauce tastes like processed goop from a can.  I am interested in perhaps sampling one of their specialty pizzas.  Perhaps they do better with more creative ventures than with traditional pizza."}
{"text":"And I'm being nice 2 large pizzas 34 bucks one veggie couldn't tell what if any of the veggies were on it .pizza 2 pepperoni and Italian sausage same sausage was ground up so fine could not even tell they put it on there first time and last ."}
{"text":"It's good pizza. No real complaints. It's definitely much better than Rascal House. This is usually my stop after a night out on Coventry, and it has less lines than any of the other places. The pizza is always hot, and the perfect thing to prevent a hangover. Gaining weight is a different story.  The price is good also. Many a time I have had pizza from their huge sheet for $20. It's a staple on campus for any event. They also deliver late, and offer coupons on their boxes for future orders. That's pretty cool."}
{"text":"First time eating guys pizza since... wow, since college at Kent!  So I mean I knew what to expect somewhat.    Delivery (Uber eats) was prompt and easy.  I ordered a guyzone, which is a calzone with a side of marinara sauce.  I also ordered the Parmesan breadsticks with a side of marinara sauce  thinking they would give me a few for 7 bucks.  Its actually a whole large pizza full of breadsticks!! I was delightfully surprised how many came, but it was just me.  I'll know next time though!  I wish upon delivery they added napkins and plastic ware, especially since it was my work meal.  Other than that, no complaints"}
{"text":"terrible service, i waited more than an hour and half but when i call the manager said they didnt even get the order.  but i have been charged. you guys should check your bank account when not delivery has not made. they charged even though they didnt deliver, they never say \" please\" \" sorry\" words to customers about what they have mistake. they have to learn how to treat customer before running business. im going to cut my hand off myself if i call them again. worst place in my life."}
{"text":"You GUYS are great. Bailed me out again with another business luncheon I did for work!  Had to order for 20 ppl and had no luck finding places around there (others open at 12 or 4pm!, or not open, or no pricing on websites).   Customer service was exceptional considering it's a pizza joint. They answered my 20 questions on phone nicely, had my large order ready at 11am, threw in flatware, plus gave a couple extra sauces for free!  They carried food to my car and got my order correct.  Many complimented the choice and all gorged themselves.. success! 4th or 5th time using a Guys Pizza w/ great luck!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. This is my only pizza experience in this area and I am completely satisfied.   You can order online; my boyfriend set up an order online for me to submit during dinnertime before he left for class. I did and voila, he picked up the food on his way home.  We shared a large calzone full of yummy pepperoni and sausage. The marinara sauce is delishhhh. The calzone is topped with lots of parmesan cheese and oregano (I personally liked the bread more than what was inside... lol).  To be honest I felt like I could eat the whole thing despite it being bigger than my face. It's because it's that good and I can only imagine it better after a night of drinking. The food here totally reminds me of undergrad days, when finding the perfect pizza place was like student's greatest treasure.  I don't know about the actual pizza though. Haven't tried that.  Beware though, food is super salty. Because I'm a crazy chick who has that yolo mentality, I'm just like... \"yummmm salt.\" This place is obviously not for the health conscious... haha"}
{"text":"In town for a night time ball game; ordered late (11:30pm); took about 30 minutes from .4 miles out, but who can complain about a place with delivery at midnight?!? Delivery guy was very nice.. Ordered a Medium 1/2 cheese 1/2 pepperoni and a 2-liter of soda; $16+change... Little pricey for a small pie.. All in all it wasn't a bad pizza.."}
{"text":"Really love the Steak Salad they offer here! Their chips can be a little salty for our liking, but we always ask for no salt and they do it just right! Their buffalo (mild) sauce is out of this world! We have pretty much tried everything they have to offer.. From their HUGE pizza, to salads, sandwiches, and calzones! My fiancé loves their chicken fingers with BBQ sauce! They are always quick and efficient!"}
{"text":"Estimated delivery time was 1 hour. 1 hour later called to ask status- on its way. Another hour later called again and was told it hasn't gone out for delivery again   Worst service ever! They offered 5$ off our next order ... why would I ever order from them again! 0 stars if that were an option! #hangryrant"}
{"text":"Worst place ever. Didn't deliver food for over 2 hours. When we called them they claimed they tried to deliver but no one was there....lie. The manager hung up on me. They wouldn't refund our money with out having to take our  credit card information again. Worst service ever."}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza... Nice crust, delicious tangy sauce, generous cheese, and quality toppings. I came in for the free slice of pizza (a promo they were doing for their grand opening) and ended up ordering a Medium with artichokes.  So good!  Where else can you get a pizza with artichokes on it?  They also use fresh mushrooms, not that icky canned stuff.  Good quality ingredients. I didn't try any, but they have a bunch of sandwiches, burgers and appetizers.  Also spotted that they do some $5 lunch specials. The staff is great, and the owner is clearly very passionate about the quality of his food and the service.  They've got a little table where you can sit and play PacMan while you eat (or wait for carryout), plus plenty of normal tables and chairs. I've never had Guy's Pizza before today... I'm so glad there's one in Medina!  You guys have a new fan.  9/14/2010 Update: Their Mini Guyzones and Gyros are enough to feed two people!  Gyros are loaded with lots of meat, and loved the fresh chips that came with them as well.   Chili was good.  Loving their $5 lunch specials."}
{"text":"Tried this food one friday about a month ago,Ordered my food at 4:51 and it took a freaking hour and change to get to my address?! Yes i was lazy normally I do pick up but I was without my car tonight. It wasn't even pizza, I got a wrap and chicken tenders. An hour?! It's a Friday I'm aware and being that I used to manage a pizza store this is completely unacceptable. Second I asked the driver to call when They were downstairs, did they read ? No. The driver was nice, polite, but whomever manages or supervises this particular store needs more training. I called to ask where my food might be and the girl could only say \"uhhhh it's not there?\", no it's not why would I call if it was?! I go to the guys downtown Cleveland weekly for lunch so this must just be a Parma store thing but wowzers. Guess I have to place my order at 2pm to get it by 530...my wrap was ruined and my wings box was crushed leaving the sauce all over my other boxes. I can't give a negative star so they get a pity one for this failure  *UPDATE* so they gave me a full refund, and i decided to try it and AGAIN they fell short. the delivery driver didnt have his \"phone\" and never buzzed into my building, when i called the store the owner grabbed the phone to say it was MY fault and that MY phone didnt work, yet you're talking to me on it right now right?? then i asked when he called and he stuttered and said the driver didnt have his phone on him. He gave me free wings, but nah im really good this time. fool  me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me."}
{"text":"BLECK!?!  After all of the talk about the \"best local pizza\" ... Guys truly disappointed me.  If you have had several too many drinks, this pizza is suffice for adding grease and calories to your stomach, however if you are sober you will insult your taste buds by ordering this."}
{"text":"They lured me in with their wonderful looking menu, found at a nearby hotel. I was shocked at what a dive it was, but I was OK with that.   The surly guy behind the counter never stood up. He grunted answers at me and nickled and dimed me so much it was insulting!  Guy's fries, sounded wonderful. Jalepenos? $0.75. OK, It comes with ranch, right? No, that's $0.50 more.   Tired looking pizza slices.  Dirty floors, homeless sitting at the outside tables.   Eek! methinks not."}
{"text":"Good slice when walking around town trashed- but I've gone sober and it was horrible. Only perk is ability to buy by the slice. Kent needs a better by the slice joint."}
{"text":"It is unreal how slow their delivery time is. I ordered a pizza at 5:10 on a Monday.  They said it would take about 45 minutes to an hour.  After an hour I called and they said that the pizza had already gone out and I should expect it soon. I did not get it for another hour. It seriously took them two hours to deliver a pizza.  If they can't handle delivery they shouldn't offer it."}
{"text":"My go to pizza place in Kent and Cuyahoga Falls. Be warned, their delivery time is horrifyingly long, but all in all they let you know beforehand and it just makes the good taste that much better haha.  Guyzones are a must with extra cheese and if you grab a pizza, their gyro meat is delicious. If you're in restaurant, they have $1 slices as a special and are great when you're roaming downtown Kent or doing a bar crawl."}
{"text":"I was craving a chicken finger sub, and upon entering this place I found out that Cleveland has never heard of this amazing creation! I explained to the girl what is was and how it's made. She was so kind and recreated it for me. It was quite delicious! I came in a couple weeks later and explained this sub to another gentleman who was kind and made the sub for me. Again it was delicious and I enjoyed it.  Third time, I thought I'd give their pizza a try. It was really unpleasant. I wanted to like it so bad but I just couldn't, it's very unappetizing to a point where I couldn't finish the slice. The cheese was so chewy, crust so thick, sauce barely there. Overall, just awful. Reviews on the New Yorker pizza seem to be good, so maybe I'll give it a try sometime.   Customer service has been great and everyone I've come in contact with there has been SO friendly each time I went there. Prices are very cheap. They deliver and open late compared to other local places.   I'd go again for the sub but NOT individually sliced pizza."}
{"text":"Just moved into the Medina area and needed to find a place for pizza to feed everyone who helped us move.  We ordered from Guys and we were not disappointed.  There pizza is great!  We also ordered antipasto salad.  It was piled high with meats and cheese.  Very good deal for the price.  Since they do not deliver to our home, we had to pick it up but the staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Even called us to make sure we were on our way as we lost track of time during the move.  We have since ordered from them again, and again."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty basic, not bad but no good either. I'd compare it to a digorno frozen pizza. Got the job done for late night ordering but not tempted to try the leftovers this morning. Will try another place the next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here. Ordered online. Estimated delivery time was 7:59pm. It's currently 8:48pm, still not delivered. I called twice and supposedly my order is \"on its way\" (we live less then 10 minutes away) Don't care if there's only one person there making pizzas like she said, this is absolutely ridiculous! Definitely won't order from here again!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and they forgot for two hours. Then proceeded to give me my food cold."}
{"text":"Pizza is Meh and their business practices don't elicit loyalty.  They don't let you know when you qualify for deals or coupons. If you realize your entitled to a deal after you pay they won't do anything to retroactively apply your discount....pretty lame in my opinion.  Orders a pizza tonight, their website says you can order free cinnamon stick..on their website. They said that was a limited time promotion and not available...also pretty lame.   If there were better pizza options available, i would absolutely chose them but there is not. Angelo's in lakewood doesnt always deliver downtown but you should try (and they honor their coupons). Vincenza's is open limited hours downtown but would be in contention for the top place in Cleveland.   Net net - don't order from these guys unless its your only option...and lower your expectations."}
{"text":"Meh.  Not good or bad.  I needed food, they delivered it on time.  Verrrrry greesy pizza.  Like in the crust not sure why.  Tasted fine....pepperoni pizza with spicy sauce is what I ordered.  Poor drink election...coke or sprint.  Uh water???  Cookie was actually good.  Called to verify my order...the guy answers all loud and speaking so fast I can't understand what he said.  But they did get my order correct and on time.  I'm a chicago guy (not deep dish) but I know pizza like the rest of Chicago and NY."}
{"text":"Oh, Guy. No thank you.   1 for the pizza. 2 for being open really late right next to the Hyatt.   My boyfriend and I determined from the sight of the pizza upon entering that it wasn't going to be good, but we didn't expect it to be that bad. No flavor. No salt. The sauce was sweet. The bread was thick and dry with no life at all.   I don't know what other Ohio pizza tastes like, but if this is the standard, come visit us on the east coast for the best salty, cheesy roller coaster ride of your life!"}
{"text":"I tried the Crunch Burger and it was yummy awesome but the fries need a little work otherwise I would've given a 5 stars."}
{"text":"Terrible delivery service!!! I was the only order in right when they opened and it look over an hour to get my food.   It's ridiculous. They aren't busy but they sure do take their sweet time.   Worst delivery ever!"}
{"text":"What can I say... the pizza here is just OK. not the best I've had and no where near the worst either. They do have deep dish which is hard to find in Cleveland. The chicken wings and salad I ordered I would not recommend to anyone. Totally disappointment. The thing that seals the deal for me is that they deliver! OK delivery no big deal you say. But if you live downtown or near downtown such as myself this is a HUGE DEAL! Plus they deliver beer too!~"}
{"text":"I feel the need to counterbalance the super high ratings for this place.  I was mislead and thought this was the classic hole in the wall pizzeria.  Don't get me wrong, it IS a hole in the wall, but they don't make up for it with their menu.    I placed my order online and requested banana peppers and extra cheese.  When I opened the box they had mistaken banana peppers for jalapeno peppers.  I was already on the road to my next destination and couldn't turn around.    If I could describe this pizza I would say it's pretty close to manufactured pizza from a Pizza Hut or Papa John's.  I wish I had read Krystal's review because \"meh\" is spot on.  I will be checking out any another pizza place when I come back to town."}
{"text":"Ever since I moved back to Cleveland from Chicago, I have been on the quest for some kind of suitable substitute for Chicago style pizza. When I heard Guy's offered Chicago style pizza I knew I had to try it. I attempted to order just cheese and they told me I had to pick 4 ingredients minimum for it to work. Immediately, I knew that it was not going to be real Chicago style pizza, but rather some kind of stuffed pizza deal that they decided to call Chicago style. Disappointing, but I still wanted to try. I ordered black olives, mushrooms, extra cheese and onions. When my pizza arrived I took a bite only to discover pineapple inside as well. Disgusting! The pizza was a sloppy, mushy pile of crap and basially not edible. I threw it away and called to complain. After arguing with a manager for 5 minutes, he agreed to give me a free pizza. A month later I ordered a regular pizza with black olives. When it came, the crust was mushy and not fully cooked. The sauce wasn't even that warm. This pizza was also not fit for human consumption, so we pitched it. I will never ever order from here again."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicago-style pizza with Italian Sausage.  The sausage was delicious, but the pizza was a far cry from being Chicago-style.  Each slice was marginally thicker than your average slice of pizza, plus the sausage was crumbled on top - not a nice consistent layer like I'd expect from that style of pizza.  On the up side, the delivery was very quick and the pizza was still warm when we got it.  The house salad was well done - they didn't skimp on the toppings.  Will probably order from here again, but not the Chicago-style pizza."}
{"text":"Hungry and needing a bite to eat late at night in a city you are not familiar with can lead you to some pretty good food.  Not wanting to venture far from our hotel late at night, we walked outside and found this place.  I have to give them credit, they are quite possibly some of the most patient people in the world.  Late at night you can guess the type of patrons they get.  Not far from the arena or the bar scene, so it gets busier as the night goes on.  We ordered and waited for our pizza, as we did, we enjoyed a beverage.    Once our pizza was ready we headed back to our hotel and dug into that pizza.  It was pretty amazing.  The cheese/sauce/toppings ratio was on point.  Even though I'm not a big fan of doughy crust, it worked for this pizza.  Maybe it was because we dug into it really fast and didn't give it time to sit."}
{"text":"We should have listened to the reviews....we read multiple reviews that said delivery orders never came. That was our experience! We waited for over an hour and a half, they charged my card and wouldn't answer the phone. Had to call delivery service for a refund. The food sounds good but I don't know because it never came."}
{"text":"normally when i come here i get taken care of...for some reason this time was different.    on most nights i order pizza, maybe 2 slices of cheese.  i switched it up a lil bit and ordered a burger.  i was aware that it would take longer, and also that because of the time of day (130am) to not expect my order to be as fast.    to make a long story short, they forgot about my order until i was the last person in the place...my order was sitting there, waiting to be handed to me, and the only thing they said to me was, \"do you want a water?\"...now i realize that this time of night gets busy.  but to totally forget someone's order is just bad."}
{"text":"I ordered this to my room while on a business trip.  This was after a Browns football game and the streets were packed.  However I had no idea it was going to take as long as it did.  It took 3 hours and ten minutes to deliver the pizza I ordered.  I was baffled.  The delivery guy was apologetic about the time it took.  However the pizza was warm and tasted average at best.  I was really disappointed."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Ordered pizza took two hours for it to be delivered. Ordered a pizza with various vegetables and found a single piece of pepperoni in it. Which we do not eat. Unless you are a desperate college student looking for food late into the night I would not recommend ordering from them."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see so many 1 star reviews for this place. I've probably ordered from them well over a dozen times and never really had a problem with the customer service or delivery.   I pretty much always order a supreme pizza whenever I call. In terms of delivery pizza, I don't think it gets much better than Guys, at least not for us on the near-west side. The crust is above average, I don't care what anyone says. But it's the cheese blend and toppings where Guys really excels. Everything tastes crisp, fresh and delicious.   I only have two complaints: they do tend to do a poor job of cutting slices and sometimes on the weekends they undercook pizzas in an attempt to get them out faster."}
{"text":"From $1 to $1.50 to $2.25 Don't get me wrong the pizza here is great but what would always make me constantly come back is the ability to walk in and get a $1 dollar slice of pizza kind of like NYC. also the price change isn t my only reason for writing this review. The fact that they have Burgers at a pizza place just makes me sick especially because they cook it on a sizzle plate that goes through the pizza oven. Come on. Quit while your ahead."}
{"text":"This was not great pizza. Sweet sauce and super greasy. The breadsticks were good though, super soft and fresh."}
{"text":"I really used to like Guys. Lets be honest though. They screw the order up about 50 percent of the time. Mostly does not arrive or goes to wrong address. The two slices and a pop for 5 bucks is a good deal. Service is hit or miss. Delivery is usually iffy. There are no bathrooms so order carry out. The place is clean as a pizzeria can be at 5 oclock. Was in this past week at about 5PM and there was no one in line. The register guy was helping another woman who couldnt decide what she wanted and so she asked if I would go ahead. He completely ignored the request and waited on her anyhow. Then when she placed the order, he pulled his smart phone out of his pocket and started playing on it. It took him 7 minutes to even take my order to tell me they were out of slices as the only guy working in there came up behind him with two large cut pizzas to put in the window. Im pretty sure he was high. So guys is good but make sure you order ahead. They have ordering online but it doesnt always work."}
{"text":"Like eating a pile of slop... and this is coming from a girl who likes all pizza, even Little Caesar's $5 Hot & Ready.  We ordered the Chicago style and the entire bottom of the box was wet from running sauce.  Hardly any toppings and sauce was so runny, they all slide off.  The sauce also tastes like tomato soup.  We were so hungry, we sucked it up, doused the pizza with ranch and ate.  So bad.  Please don't waste your money."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time, and have always received at least half decent service, however, the other day was beyond bad. I don't know what's going on, but it seems like whenever they put more than one girl behind the counter both quality control and the ability to competently serve disappear.   Even though this location has a drive-thru, I dared to venture inside, thinking that I might be leaving a tip as usual. WRONG. I noticed that both the parking lot and the wait area were empty, so I figured service would be quick and easy; once again, WRONG. I ended up not being served at all and left without purchasing anything. I came here to grab a quick lunch, but ended up COMPLETELY ignored by 3 different servers who walked past me. When I peeked further into their \"kitchen\", I noticed that there were salads and raw chicken being prepared without gloves (can you say salmonella), and not a single hair covering was worn. I guess it's good that they ignored me; who knows what kind of illness I may have contracted from here. Not only will I not be returning, I advise that no one else come here."}
{"text":"I don't really do their pizza too often. I generally stick to their subs and salads which are great. The BBQ chips that come with the subs are really good too."}
{"text":"Great pizza and the fact that they deliver to Brimfield gets them even a better ranking! Its a MUST to get the BIG NEW YORKER, its so big you have to tilt the box to get it in the doors lol. At least try it once!  Love the fact you can get a slice of pie and a drink for cheap and get it quick.  The BIG EASY is a great flavor for the wings if your tired of the same ol hot/mild sauce."}
{"text":"The two stars is only because they agreed to fix it. Although it does me no good. I'm a flight attendant and need to be sleep now for my pick up in the morning. Waiting almost an hour for 6 hot and spicy garlic wings, a salad, and some fries... I got a salad with nothing to eat it with (no untensils), soggy fries, and wings fried to a crisp with NO SAUCE. I am so mad right now. I have to choose between dinner or enough sleep to work tomorrow. #PISSED.  Never again will I order from them, my advice, look elsewhere for delivery orders. At least in person they have to fix it on the spot!"}
{"text":"Once again, Guys Pizza saved my hungry-little-life on a Sunday night.   Seriously, if you live in Ohio City, you're in a pizza delivery dead zone. And the 'zza places that will deliver either stop at 9pm and/or they aren't open on Sundays. We live in a urban area, folks. People don't go to bed at 8pm on Sunday nights. We want a pie delivered to our door late night. Why can't you understand this?!  Guys Pizza was open, delivering, helpful and fast on a Sunday night after 10:30pm. That's seriously unheard of around here. Besides that, the pizza was delish! I just cannot jive with the rubbery, canned mushrooms that a certain local spot uses. But Guys uses fresh shrooms! We ordered a deluxe and although they were out of sausage, they offered another topping to sub. No crabby attitude, just good service.   They were at three stars, but I just have to bump them up for their customer service, availability and yummy 'zza. It's not the best in the world, but it's good and it's delivered late. Winner, winner, pizza in my face for dinner."}
{"text":"I've ordered before and they forgotten stuff and again tonight they forgot the soda. I called at 5:39 and they are 2 minutes away. 6:15 and still not back. Waste of money. Won't be ordering again from there.   Pizza was not that great also."}
{"text":"While I stand by my previous statement about the pizza, I have to now add that the \"Guyzone\" is amazing! The two that I have tried were enormous and jam packed with tasty ingredients. I liked that there is either very little or no sauce on the inside, but rather the calzone comes apart in strips that you can dip in the sauces that come with it. Try one with gyro meat and and the tzatziki dipping sauce!"}
{"text":"Thank you, Guy's Pizza! I was sick on my birthday and just wanted some delicious take-out pizza - you guys gave me exactly what I needed!"}
{"text":"Good old Guys Pizza. Nothing beats getting a slice to go, whether it's 2am or 2pm. I love how sweet the sauce is and how dense the crust is. There is a reason Guys has stuck around while so many other pizza chains in Kent have come and gone. Yum!"}
{"text":"Found this mini chain pizza place by accident. Prices are average for the area.  Zesty red sauce is indistinguishable from the normal red sauce. Then again that could be my fault since anything less than scorpion peppers are mild to me.  Pizza was good. Not great, not bad. Fairly unmemorable but I would not rule out ordering again or eating a few slices if offered.  One major complaint I have against chains, is the adage you can't lead from behind. Meaning, this place like all the other chains, carry the same toppings and have the same specialty pizzas. Heck even the subs are clones of competitors. Learn from the Mom and Pop's and take a risk!"}
{"text":"It's pizza.  Jazz it up with fancy names and fold it over into a calzone and it's still just a pizza.  The service was good and the delivery fast and hot. Still just an everyday slice of pie."}
{"text":"Late Night Pizza's when you need it most!  This place opened when I was at Case - and it made our late night adventures post Panini's or McNulty's that much better!    From what I recall, then line was always incredibly long, so be prepared to wait - but it's worth it for that sobering slice of heaven.    Sweet Sauce, yummy crust - and cheap.  No bad!"}
{"text":"Grabbed some Guy's Pizza for the first time on the way home from my son's hockey game in Elyria. Not sure why, I was surprised how good it was. The bacon was really crispy, and the sausage had nice flavor. The pizza was light on sauce, heavy on cheese. The inner part was relatively thin, but the ends were crusty (too crusty for me). But it had great flavor, the kids like it and they also liked the cheesy bread which was very cheesy and garlicy."}
{"text":"This is hard to review. While in no way would I go here over say Valentino's (another Cleveland Heights pizza option) I need to share my experience with this place.   I once ordered a regular pizza, I think with pepperoni and mushrooms, and it was truly mediocre. Very little sauce, sparse use of toppings, and took about 75  minutes for delivery and I live about a half mile away. I have had better pizza from domino's or Pizza hut. BUT, and this is a huge but, their SHEET pizza tastes a LOT better than the regular pizza. I do not know why, but it just does. Almost to the point that it seems like it is from a completely different restaurant all together. I would definitely recommend the sheet pizza, 32 square slices that would easily serve 3-5 people depending on their appetites, to those looking for better than average pizza while trying to save some travel time and money!"}
{"text":"Best chain pizza in Cleveland, IMO.  The regular pizzas are very good, and the sauce has a sweeter flavor to it (could be a turn-off for some, but not for me).  However, if you like New York-style pizza, and can carry a pizza the size of your car out the door (instead of asking for help, bring a friend...DUH), I highly recommend the New Yorker.  Make sure you're hungry, though.  Much better than Gepettos or Zeppes, and they will get my business every time."}
{"text":"It's was super busy during ncaa wrestling championships at the Q, so there was quite a wait, but the pizza was great! Must try their version of a Hawaiian! It was damn good!"}
{"text":"This place is on my good list forever!  They were the only pizza place in downtown Cleveland that delivered on New Years Eve.  The service was fast and the driver was very nice despite having to work on the holiday.  On top of everything else, the pizza was delicious.  A crunchy crust that was perfectly browned with just the right amount of cheesy spillover.  The toppings were fresh, not old and dry, which I always appreciate.  All in all, a great pizza joint.  I will definitely hit them up again."}
{"text":"You're drunk, and the Coventry bars just closed...getting pizza is the only logical next step. So to Guys Pizza you go. It's nothing too special, but it's greasy and will prevent a terrible hangover, so why not.  I've never had it sober, so I really don't know if it's actually delicious. It certainly does the trick for me late night, though."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery online and it literally never came. They took our money, gave an estimate, and then didn't answer the phones when we called to ask about an ETA since it had been 80 mins (original estimated delivery was 40)."}
{"text":"Probably great if you sweet tooth. Thier sauce has sugar in it. To sweet for my taste but the service is great."}
{"text":"Been ordering from here for a while.  I miss their sub sandwiches, which they took off their menu.  Their pizzas are very good.  I know everyone has their particular likes when it comes to sauce and dough, but this one makes the mark.  Toppings are fresh and plentiful.  Guy's fries are very indulgent but good.  The Guyros are large, with somewhat processed lamb, but flavorful.  We have ordered delivery from them, and have not been disappointed.  I find it curious that three chain pizza delivery restaurants in the area have closed in the past year, but Guys keeps going strong.  Must saysomething."}
{"text":"Had the calzone (Guyzone) here. Have to say, it was AMAZING. Probably the best one I've ever had. Maybe I was just hungry, I don't know, but this thing hit the spot. Got it delivered and ordered online. Delivery fee was very reasonable and I got a quote instantly with an ETA. The delivery arrived ahead of schedule and the food was hot and fresh.   Why only three stars then??  Unfortunately, like other people have indicated, they don't bring your whole order!!! In my case, they forgot to bring the drinks and pita w/hummus. This seems to happen a lot here based on other reviews combined with my experience. Great way to make an honest mistake AND pad your bottom line."}
{"text":"DO NOT USE GUYS PIZZA FOR ANY LARGE ORDERS.   TERRIBLE service. We had a large pizza order (over $400) for a company event and they were 45 minutes late. They also failed to provide us with adequate plates and silverware (only gave us around 10 plates) for an event we specified we expected at least 50 people which required silverware."}
{"text":"New to our neighborhood Guys Pizza is doing pretty well.  The Pizza comes with large slices which is cool but personally I don't care for the crust.  The toppings are good.  They don't skimp.  On another order my wife and I both had a Guyzone. (Calzone)  The dipping sauce is better than average and the Guyzone's were good.  Plenty of filling but again the crust just doesn't work for me.  It's too chewy or something.  All in all I've had worse and I've had better."}
{"text":"What happened to this Guys?!     Several weeks ago we ordered our usual and it was completely greasy and under cooked.  At the time we chalked it up to a fluke.   Tonight we ordered delivery; a large pepperoni pizza, 12 wings and a can of diet coke.    The delivery girl came with no coke and handed us a small pizza box and a bag with our wings.  When she said she forgot our coke she offered to grab one at the gas station which I thought was a nice gesture since we did pay for it.  While waiting on her return we opened the pizza box and discovered it was a medium ham and bacon.  When the delivery girl returned she said she wouldn't be back because she wanted to go home but said she'd call guys on her way back.    We haven't received an apology call... In fact we had to call the store after waiting 15-20 min.  One would think that they would call to 1. Apologize 2. Reassure the right order would be delivered soon and 3. Come the order.    I don't think this was a complicated order and two items were screwed up.    We won't be ordering from here anymore."}
{"text":"Ordered two sandwiches for delivery at 8:30pm. The gentleman on the phone told me one hour.  After 1.5 hrs I called and the person told me it was out for delivery along with 7 other deliveries and it should be there soon.  Two hours later...still waiting."}
{"text":"The pizza isn't bad, but their customer service is terrible.  The website quotes an \"everyday price\" for two large pizzas.  I was quoted a higher price.  I asked them to lower it and I was told that I had to mention the deal before I ordered.  That's not an \"everyday price\" if I have to mention it as a special.  I asked them to back out the order and start over at the correct price and I was told that was not possible.  I told them to cancel the order, which was possible, but they refused to start the order at the correct price.  The website advertisement of the \"everyday price\" does not mention this rule.  They refused to help me out at all.  I got much better service elsewhere that evening, and at a fair price."}
{"text":"Not even if you're belligerently drunk. No. I waited half an hour for crappy pizza with rubbery cheese and no sauce in an atmosphere with 30 tanked-off-their-asses patrons squeezed into a tiny shop. The BO turned my appetite. (And while I understand that's not the businesses fault, I never would've thought I'd wait 30 minute for a pizza when I was the second person in line when I walked in.) Pizza is like sex usually - even when it's bad it's good, but at least know when you're bad and be fast if that's all you've got to offer, because this sure wasn't offering anything else. Also I ordered fries and what I got were super spicy. Usually I put sriracha on everything so I'm not afraid of heat, but at least advertise that's how it is if you're giving people spicy fries."}
{"text":"This was the first time we've ordered from Guys Pizza as we make our way around the Parma pizza circuit.  We ordered a sheet pizza on Friday for a party to be picked up Saturday at 5:30.  The price quoted was $19.99. When I arrived on Saturday at the specified time the pizza was ready but the price had increased to $21.99 - Apparently they have a Friday special and quoted me the Friday price but charged me the Saturday price. Not a big deal. The pizza was okay but nothing stood out about it.  There are definitely other options in the area and many of them taste better."}
{"text":"The 2-star review for these guys is well deserved. My daughter goes to medical school and ordered pizza on my AMEX.  When they said the delivery time would be 1.5 hours, she cancelled.  They still charged my AMEX card $32.98.  I have called and emailed them but they refuse to either refund the money or send her some more food.  They had a real attitude toward me on the phone.  Lousy service, lousy attitude, and $32 for a pizza? I'm never going here and I've told my daughter not to go to ANY Guys Pizza.  Not on my AMEX!"}
{"text":"Cold pizza and slow delivery! Need I say more. The delivery driver did not carry change and expected I leave the rest for a tip. Here's a tip, deliver hot pizza and carry change."}
{"text":"We ordered Guys late night while staying in CLE. This was one of the ONLY places that delivered past midnight on a Saturday night which I thought was odd.   3 stars for the pizza which was thought was a little above average.  1 extra star for being the hero of the night - and being the only place to deliver.   Only one small complaint, the garlic butter inside spilled and literally soaked through the entire box and the bottom of our pizza was soggy. Granted - a pizza soaked in garlic butter whilst tipsy is not the WORST thing to happen...BUT it did ruin my husbands beautiful Italian leather shoes because when the delivery driver handed it to him it was literally leaking through the box   it was that saturated.   Oh, well I guess you can replace things. Accidents happen... I would still order again."}
{"text":"Guys pizza...I used to like you...when I rented on Hampshire and your $1.5 slices hit the 'beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, pizza' spot.  I used to buy pizza from you even after I realized that dollar for dollar there are several pizzerias around the CH area that deliver a better pie (Dewey's, Marrotta's, Valentino's, Mama Santa's, even Pizza BOGO!)  But a couple of years, maturity in the work and life areas  and a terrible customer service episode later, I vowed to stay away. Until this afternoon when feeling nostalgic, I ordered a couple of sheet pizzas and salad for a work event.  I hoped for a good customer service experience and sure enough, placing the order via phone was a pleasant process.Pick up though was a...flashback to the last time I ordered from Guys. Yes, cashier in knit hat and orange tee, you know what I am talking about.  When a customer faced with the prospect of juggling three sheet pizza boxes, a tray of salad, a couple of containers of dressing and an umbrella says she will bring her car to the front of the shop and asks if someone would be willing to bring the pizzas outside, the answer from this cashier is a curt NO. Forget 'Sure, its three steps to the door and three more to the edge of the curb and you are a valued customer' or even a 'I am sorry but I can't leave the register and we don't have anyone else to help you at this moment'. Instead its a  'No. I can let you bring the car outside but I wont bring the pizzas outside.'  So, as I balanced the aforementioned pizza boxes, salad tray and dressing containers and  struggled to open the door with my elbow, I vowed to a) leave a yelp review and b) to never come back."}
{"text":"I really like Guys Pizza Co, living fairly close to downtown the pizza options are Rascals (greasy), or Pizza Hut (cardboard) and a friend of mine recommended Guys Pizza and I've never ordered anywhere else.  I always get delivery since parking downtown is difficult.  I also always order online because that's where the specials are. I called once and the girl didn't really know anything about the menu or the specials.  The pizza is really good, you can order a \"zesty sauce\" which is a marinara sauce with a bit of a kick that's delicious.  I also typically order the garlic buffalo wings (they have a deal for a lg 1 topping pizza + 12 wings (boneless/bone-in for only $20) and then tag on the Parmesan breadsticks because they're simple, inexpensive and addicting.   When we started ordering there in Jan/Feb 2016 the delivery would take a really long time, and it did deter us from ordering a few times.  Recently we've been ordering and it takes half the time they say it will (about 30 minutes).    I almost wrote an angry review after the couple of times it took forever, and the girl over the phone wasn't helpful, but I've had more good experiences choosing Guys Pizza than poor ones."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service. When I ordered online and my pizza didn't come, I called them and they told us that sometimes their websites don't process orders completely, and it would take them another 45 minutes to make the pizza. Then it took them an additional 40 minutes to deliver the pizza, even though I live only 5-10 minutes away driving time (I don't own a car otherwise I would have eaten elsewhere). When I went to pick up pizza, the driver's friends were in the car with him - why?!  Do not order from them. This is the kind of place you go at 2 in the morning when nothing else is open and it is the last option for food."}
{"text":"I really wish we had a place like this in Indianapolis. We just got back from going to Howl Cleveland (which also rocked) and we were hungry. It's 2am, if we're running in Indy mode it means there's NOTHING open, which sucks. BUT since we're in Cleveland we explored our options.   After going through the revolving door of restaurants we landed on this little gem. I'm going to compare it to indy. I live in downtown indy. There aren't any solid pizza joints that are open late, So that's a plus. Also the guy on the phone was really cool. Our convo went like this:  Worker: Hello, Guys Pizza Co. Josh: Yeah I want the FIVE TOPPING DEEP DISH ($16.95)  Worker: What toppings do you want? Josh: Pepperoni, Sausage, Red Onions, Green Peppers and Bacon. Work: Sounds good. Josh: Word Worker: Did you just say \"Word\"? Josh: uh Yeah? Worker: I've never heard anyone over 23 say that. Josh: How old are you? Worker: 21 Josh: Ah.... (Jokingly) You don't think you could make us a large and charge us for a medium do you? Worker: Alas I cannot. Josh: Okie doke, We're at the double tree room 1525 Worker: it'll be there in 45.  So me and my buddy wait 40 minutes (it was early), My buddy pays the man. He sets the pizza down on the desk, Opens it up and says \"hey there's a note here.\" The note reads as follows.  \"Went ahead and made you the large - Word\"  Well I'll be damned......   Anyway, I haven't had solid Chicago style pizza like this in a VERY long time. The pizza was phenomenal! So thick and meaty *Giggity*  Czeq these folks out! They make a solid pizza!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Guy's Pizza and I went in with an open mind, having never heard anyone speak of eating there prior to my experience. What an experience it was! It was Sunday night and I was quite hungry yet did not want to drive anywhere to eat, so I thought 'how could I go wrong with some Pizza Delivery?' I live Downtown so after doing some quick internet research, found Guy's Pizza was right down the street.    I decided to order a large cheese pizza and some boneless wings. About 35-40 minutes later, my food arrived and I could hardly wait to dig in! Then my enthusiasm quickly waned.... The crust of the pizza was tough and 'chewy' (not in a good way) and sauce was overly sweet. The best pizzas have a crust that is either crisp or flaky or fluffy, depending on how you order it. It should never taste like the box it came in, however this may be Guy's specialty. Anyway, unfulfilled by the slice of pizza, I opened up the box containing \"boneless wings\"... You know those times when you can take one look at the food in front of you and KNOW its going to taste bad? Yes. These overly breaded balls of chicken meat particles generously referred to as \"boneless wings\" were horrible. I mean they were worse than any chicken product you can pull out of your local Wal-Mart freezer!   After eating Guy's you will get two distinctive feelings. Feeling #1 comes immediately: 'buyer's remorse'. Feeling #2 comes a bit later and it depends on how much \"Guy's\" food you ingest... You can use your imagination on that one...  Two final thoughts: Makes Domino's taste like world-class award-winning pizza...  How do they stay in business? Government grants?  Stay away if at all possible. Tastes even worse reheated."}
{"text":"Last night we had a horrible experience with this place.  This was not our first order, in past and the food was good and the people were nice.  The only reason there is two stars is because of how the manager handled it the next day.  8:07 pm we ordered a pizza online for delivery.  Ordered for ASAP, email confirmation showed due at 8:59.    At 8:30 they called to say that they were out of the funnel cake fries and asked if I wanted a substitution item.    At 9:27, at which time the pizza is now 30 minutes late, I called to find out where the pizza is.  The woman was EXTREMELY rude, saying we should have called the store after placing the order online for a real estimated time.  What is the purpose of ordering online if you have to call the store?   Besides, they had already called us earlier about the substitution item.  Anyway, back to our call.  We are told \"it is on the way\" and she hung up on me cutting off mid-sentence.  She never asked my name or number as she wouldn't let us explain anything before terminating the call.  Since the restaurant is only three miles away we expected the pizza soon.    It is now 9:43, 20 minutes since we were told \"it's on the way\".  When I ask about our pizza that we ordered close to two hours ago, she is again EXTREMELY rude saying, \"it's on the way\".  At this time we mention she told us the same thing 20 minutes ago.   At that statement she becomes even ruder saying she never said any such thing because she never spoke to us!  I asked how she can tell me that since she never asked our order name or number.  That is when she tells me we were the only delivery order that night and again repeats \"it's is on the way\" and hung up as I was still speaking.    The pizza finally arrived a few minutes later at 9:47.  If what I just went through wasn't bad enough, the pizza arrived undercooked!  The bottom was cooked but the dough under the toppings was still raw. To make matters ever worse, the wings and guyzone were cold also as they had obviously been sitting for a long time.  So when it's all say and done, almost two hours and we couldn't even eat the pizza.   Photo uploaded to show raw pizza dough.  The next day we called and spoke to the manager.  He was apologetic and even called us back after checking into what happened on his end.  There is a $20 credit on fill for a future order.  After the experience we had, it is doubtful we will use it.  I can understand having issues with food quality however, nothing can justify how we were treated by that employee."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try because of bad ratings, but it's the only place to delivers in our area so we tried anyway. The pizza is actually really good!! Expect greasy and very cheesy which are great things in my book. For cheap delivery pizza, it's definitely better than most. The inside of the store is a little off putting, but pizza is still yummy!"}
{"text":"Continue to exceed expectations. This is good pizza and calzone. Seriously, I've read some digs on problems, but the recipe for quality is clearly right. The web site is easy to navigate and the food tastes great. By all standards this is a solid bet. Just hope the staff is ready on any given night."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and delivery within the time frame provided, but neither Guyzone came with the requested sauce (just came with standard marina). Don't offer choices if you won't pay attention to them."}
{"text":"This place is really a hit or miss. I've ordered delivery multiple times and I've always had great service!  The only problem I ever had was one topping mix up. If you order delivery, plan for about 20 minutes after whatever time they give you. They're usually late but the food is always hot still when we get it.  I love the calzones! Their medium and large sizes are huge. The pizza is pretty good, never liked the crust though. But I guess they have different pizza guys on different days because like I said, it's a hit or miss here!  We've been ordering delivery from here for weeks on weeks before we saw the yelp reviews. So don't let that scare you away!"}
{"text":"What a joke. I've tried this place in two occasions. Had their \"Chicago style\" pizza and the crust was hard and overly chewy. Not what I've had in Chicago. I tried again tonight after a few months and the wait time was longer than Marcos so I tried to cancel my order. The General Manager said he couldn't cancel the order. WHAT??? He told me to log on to the website to cancel! There is no way to do this. Then he said to write an email. An email? Really??"}
{"text":"Called to order pizza for delivery. Some ghetto ass dude says \"Hello\"! I said is this guys pizza? He mumbles something couldn't understand his ghetto ass. I said \"what? Excuse me?\". He yells \"We's closed bitch\"! Then hangs up. Beyond rude!!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice people.  Food is decent.  They always have great coupons which makes it really afordable!  They have the garlic dipping sauce whice is a bonus for me."}
{"text":"First time I tried Guys. Ordered a small cheese pizza for delivery. Pizza was ok. Next time I would select thin crust though. The crust on the regular is about a half inch thick. It was just to much bread."}
{"text":"The pizza I can do without. There are MUCH better pizza options in Kent. The Calzones are the best item on their menu, IMHO."}
{"text":"Tried Guys pizza while I was in Cleveland for the weekend. Very pleasantly surprised. Fast delivery to the Hyatt Regency. Good prices. Great calzone!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times and the pizza really isn't that good. Being able to buy by the slice is excellent, but the customer service regularly sucks.   This weekend is the last time I'll be going there. With several other pizza options within walking distance this earned last place just based on their treatment of my friend. Every time I'm in there I feel like I'm treated like an a**hole because I'm white. Then when I saw they just didn't care and did the same thing to my friend who isn't white, it's clearly that they have people employed there who are just miserable and shouldn't  be there.   Working a block over you have kafeteria, captain Tony's, market cafe and so on you can order better tasting pizza and better customer service. I won't be eating here even if it's the only option."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Westin about a block away and walked out for a PIzza. When I got to the counter, \" They had a deal for me\" ! Someone order a great Pizza built but not in the oven and cancelled. I got it for 10 dollars, walked back to room, stopped in the bar and got a plate, knife and fork and two glasses of wine and went to my room. The pizza was fantastic. Loaded with peppers, red onions, suave , roasted tomatoes and artichokes. It tasted great. The pizza was 10 buckets and the wine 23 dollars. I wish some one was here to eat the rest.  I am glad I walked over there and didn't get a delivery."}
{"text":"It's hard to feel good about yourself if you're older than 21 and still on Coventry stuck eating Guys pizza (tastes like cardboard). Great place to watch the Cleveland Heights police blotters unfold live each night."}
{"text":"If I could post 0 stars I would. This is the worst pizza place, ever. I ordered pizza online and it charged my card 5 times, FIVE. I try calling and their phones aren't working so I drove down and walked in the pouring rain to get my money back and my pizza. The guy tells me they're too busy right now to help me- so they took down my info to refund me at another time and then asked if I wanted my pizza still- because it was going to take an HOUR AND A HALF!!!!! I got charged over $100 for pizza I never received. I will never get pizza here EVER again. 10/10 don't recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"If you're looking for fancy pizza and unique ingredients, this isn't the pizza joint for you.  This is your typical chain pizza (albeit a small chain) cranked out to serve the masses.  And in this location, the masses of drunk college kids.  Although I'm not a college kid, I happened to drop by at 2:20 am - 10 minutes before closing, and right before someone shouted \"last call for pizza.\" Considering that they probably get mobbed late at night, I thought they could have been better prepared to serve the hungry mob of people waiting patiently for grub. (why weren't pizzas flying out of the oven?)  I got my one greasy slice of cheese pizza for $1.50.  On a paper plate.  There were no napkins to be found, but one can't be picky that late at night.  Was it the best pizza I've ever eaten?  Definitely not.  Think cafeteria pizza.  But...it served its purpose.  Cheap, fast, fresh.  What more do you really need that late at night?"}
{"text":"We arrived at our downtown Cleveland hotel exhausted and hungry after a long day traveling. Too tired to go out (and on Sunday in Cleveland that can be hit-and-miss anyway) we decided to order from Guys Pizza.  We ordered a special combo (pizza, breadsticks, and a 2-liter) and an order of Guys Fries through the online order system, which was fairly easy to use.  A few minutes later, Guys calls to inform us they are out of fries.  They were also out of hamburgers.  OK, it happens on Sunday, so we switched it to a calzone (\"Guyzone\").  A couple minutes later, they call back because they forgot what we ordered.  OK, better to make sure than to send the wrong thing.  Delivery was earlier than promised, which was nice, and they did deliver directly to the hotel room.  Only problem:  \"Where's the Sprite?\"  \"It's not on the ticket.\"  He showed me the ticket, which clearly listed a Sprite.  He apologized and promised he would be right back.  About 10 minutes later, he came back with a Sprite.  I didn't have the heart to tell him the breadsticks were missing, too.  After seeing the portion sizes, we didn't really need them.  So for executing the main function of a restaurant, namely having the food that's on the menu and getting the order right, they get 1/5.  But they get 4/5 on customer service.  The food was...meh. It's not especially difficult to get pizza right, but this was disappointing by any standard.  Toppings, though plentiful, were lacking in flavor. The crust was midway between thick and thin and not as satisfying as either.  The highlight was the marinara sauce for the calzone, but even that was too sweet and ice-cold.  Still, as the saying goes, even when pizza is bad, it's still pretty good.  2/5 on the food quality, if only because it could have been worse.  I won't be back unless I just don't have any other options, but it's passable in a pinch."}
{"text":"To fully understand this rating, I have to give a little background info. I landed in Cleveland at 10:30 pm on a Monday night for a conference. As soon as I got to my AirBnB, I was starving and looking for places to eat. Well, apparently everything (restaurants, grocery stores, etc.) closes super early in Cleveland, even downtown, and I had nothing to eat. In comes Guys Pizza Co., saving my hungry a$$!! I ordered the Chicken Bianco Pizza and an order of wings (hey, I was hungry, don't judge me!), and I was soooooooo happy with it! I've ordered pizza out of desperation before, many times, and I'm not always happy with the results. This was not the case here. The wings were delicious, hot and spicy, and just the way I like them. And the pizza was just as good and perfect for late night eats. Even the delivery was relatively quick!  Seriously, if you are in the need for a late night pie, you can rely on Guys Pizza Co!"}
{"text":"Perfect spot for a tasty slice while visiting Tower City or Playhouse Square. Although they don't have the variety of lunch slices that Captain Tony's provides, they are substantially cheaper (cheap drink combo also) and less busy. Small dining room but I always find a seat. I appreciate that the pie is always well sauced."}
{"text":"Meh.  This seems like mostly a downtown grab a slice and go sort of place.  I was excited as it seemed like a great local institution given the Clevelandy décor, but was decidedly underwhelmed on the pizza.  I placed a call in order for take out.  Got there early before it was done and had to wait.  Usually takeout places will still ring you up so you can just get going when your pizza is ready, but they didn't.  Minor annoyance, but quite forgiveable.  Took the pizza back to our hotel room and they hadn't completely sliced the pizza.  And by that I mean they sliced through the cheese and toppings, but not the crust so we had to tear off the slices by hand.  Annoyance rising.  Good pizza can save such a situation, but this was not good pizza.  The cheese and toppings were yummy, but the crust was mediocre at best while the sauce was awful.  It was way too sweet.  Maybe that's a local preference, I've noticed that in some places like Savannah Georgia they seem to like their sauce on the sweeter side, but this was nigh inedible.  Ended up just eating the toppings off the slices, which I suppose helped preview what life under the Atkins diet might be like, but that's not why I ordered their pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza was good, but the temperature in the restaurant had to be over 100 degrees.  I asked one of the employees why the air conditioning wasn't turned on and she said that the owner would not allow it to be turned on.  She also said the heat was not turned on in the winter. When customers left the doors opened an a breath of fresh air followed. The employee said that the conditions were hard to work under.  I bet."}
{"text":"One of the worst in Kent. Too greasy and not tasty. The oil was dripping from the box and I had to throw it away. The wings I ordered were not have similarity to normal eatable wings. There should be other better options in Kent."}
{"text":"I ordered from here twice this week and both times were great. The first time I ordered delivery, Charlie confirmed my order and the food came in a timely fashion and was very good.  The second time Terrell took my order and again the food came hot, very good, and the order was perfect. The delivery guys were also very friendly both times. I'm visiting Cleveland from out of town and staying at The Hyatt Regency. There are very few delivery places near here so it's good this option is nearby. I'll order from here again when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Who delivers anything else besides pizza to a hotel? Guys Pizza Co. that's who!! Stuck in hotel without room service; and not wanting pizza. Ordering online was a breeze & takeout delivered exactly at time quoted. Delivery guy was nice & courteous too.  Ordered Buffalo Wings medium hot that were decent size and very flavorful and cooked well done (as ordered) plus a side salad that was fresh lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, olives, grated provolone & croutons. Ranch dressing (not a blue cheese person) was thick & yummy almost more like dip than dressing. My coworker ordered a meatball sub she said was delicious and just the right size. Highly recommend Guys!"}
{"text":"New York style pizza  freakin' big as a table  red sauce pizza joy   Not wanting to venture out to any downtown restaurants on St. Patty's day, empty fridge to boot, I thought to give Guys another try. My first Guys Pizza experience was quite good. Without too much thought, I ordered a healthy dinner of 6 Cajun/Garlic wings, and a \"New York\" style pizza, hoping for that thin, thin crust. Delivery was fast, food was hot, just like last time.   Really good wings! Meaty, not greasy and never having tried the cajun-garlic before, I'm glad I did. 5 star wings for sure. The pizza, yikes! It was the biggest I had ever seen. The crust was more like a medium thickness. Given my druthers, I would have preferred it to be thinner and a bit more cooked, but... ...works for me.   I think Guys has become my \"go-to\" downtown pizza. The sauce is delicious. Seriously delicious. The pizza was the size of a truck tire. Jeeez, even the box it came in could make a homeless shelter. I ate 2 slices of the 8 and was way full. The New York style would be great for a party, as long as you don't need to take your door off of it's hinges to get it in.   So, having tried both the Chicago deepdish style from Guys, as well as the New York version, I'm looking forward to the next one.    Carry on."}
{"text":"I really like guys pizza for the quality of pizza you receive, but it takes so long to be delivered its honestly not worth it. I have waited multiple times for over two hours. Each time I call they say it's on the way rudely and hang up the phone not giving me a chance to respond. I'm officially done ordering from them since the definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results!"}
{"text":"One of the few pizza places that are open late late night. Great drunk food, average pizza tho. Sometimes its amazing, other times it's ok. I guess depends how drunk you are."}
{"text":"Don't expect to get a pizza around dinner time on a Friday. Ordered ours today at 6:30 pm was told 45 mins to an hour and it's 10 pm and still not here. Called at 7:45 asking where it was and was told its being delivered. Called again at 8:15 to find out it was never even sent out but will be the next one delivered. Clearly not the case... Hopefully I get it before tomorrow. If I could rate them a half star I would"}
{"text":"Love guys pizza.. But still waiting over 40 minutes for my delivery. It's quite upsetting. So .. If you're ordering from here order two hours before you actually want it, or add 45+ minutes to your estimated delivery time."}
{"text":"Guy's Pizza Co. Coventry Location has an average of 2.5 stars, say what?! I can't believe these 1 and 2 star reviews!? I have always experienced friendly and fast service at this Guy's pizza location. Although I have to admit the only time I go here is before I go to a show at the Grog Shop. I'd have to say I like the NYC small pizza joint vibe. The place is always filled with HS kids hanging out, laughing, and eating.   It has been my tradition ever since Guys opened on Coventry Rd and the Grog moved to its south Coventry Rd location - that before a show I get a slice of pizza and a can of Tahitian Treat for only $2.75!  On this particular evening before the Chelsea Peretti - America Treasure Tour show. I went in for my ritual slice & can of TT. And there was no more TT!!! I was sadden by the lack of product and the counter girl shared my disappointment. I reluctantly ordered a Sprite. As I left the manager came in with a whole bunch of Tahitian Treats -and the counter girl gave me one on the house!! Granted it's only $0.75 but, it was the thought that counted and for that I give them 5 STARS!!!!  By the looks of the other reviews they don't do delivery or big orders well. So, I say if you want a quick bite while shopping, walking around Coventry, or before a show this the place to go!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here after Lebron splashes one in Thad's eye in game 5- further evidence of pure kingage. At any rate- walking distance from my hotel and from The Q, and since Barrio constantly is an hour wait, I'll wait to go together on a trip here.   First impression. ZERO humans in the building. Very divey inside and kind of a white paint, random racks and odd tables with 20oz coke bottles. There was one pizza under heat light behind glass, that looked like it was there since open, so we strayed from slices and instead ordered a pizza to share.   As we waited, 1-2-3-4 pizzas were brought out and put under heat lamps and behind same glass. The clerk (I'll get to him in a minute), could have said - \"Hey we have some pizzas coming out if you guys want just slices.\" But no. Then 10 people filed in, got slices, ate, and left in the time it took us to get any food.   Staff is very rough. Clerk had a hood up, bandana on, face tattoo, and forgot about our food when it came out. Nice guy, somewhat quiet but is that who you want representing you?  The pizza? Decent. Reminds me of the kind you get from a bowling alley snack bar. Nothing special. Just good for late night food."}
{"text":"This is the Dominoes of deep dish. Nothing about my pie was Chicago style. I could rant on with more but if you aren't catching on by now...."}
{"text":"I ordered 24 chicken wings with four different dipping.... Both chicken wings and dipping tasted good... The chicken wings were Not GREASY at all.. They even tasted the same the next day I microwaved them. I will definitely order from Guys Pizza Co again."}
{"text":"Dinnertime, staying in the city, needed to feed a group.  If you really care about the pizza that you are eating or feeding your friends, I would pass on this place.  It was in no way \"New York\" style -- half of our party was from Brooklyn -- the crust was very much like standard Pizza Hut, medium thickness and mushy.  The sauce was not tomato-y but was somehow specially spiced and it burned going down.  The sausage was shriveled and crispy.  They were nice on the phone and delivered to a hotel quickly, but definitely something I would recommend passing on as a pizza experience."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE SERVICE AND TREATMENT!!   I will NOT come here ever again for how inconsiderate the \"gentleman\" behind the counter was. I waited over ten minutes for lunch pizzas to be ready (it was noon, so why were there NO pizzas ready when you opened an hour ago??). I guess I didn't count or matter because another person walked right up to the counter and asked for the SAME thing that I asked about (lunch slices) and he made a sale with him right away!!!! I was so upset I just walked out! I will not be returning to this location. There are SEVERAL other pizza places in the area to try."}
{"text":"We were in from out of town and decided to order pizza. When placing the order, my husband clearly stated that our order was ick up. We had a coupon for calzones which the person taking our order had no clue about. Then my husband ordered the pizza and had them repeat our order back...it was wrong! We cleared everything up and were told 35 minutes...fine. My husband went for the pizza and upon arriving, our food was not there! They sent it out with the delivery girl! To top it off, we never gave her an address! Omg! Never again Guys Pizza! Thank goodness I live in Michigan so I never have to experience this kind of debacle again!"}
{"text":"Ordered a three topping call one and picked it up . Discovered the Calzone had the wrong toppings (no big deal,mistakes happen) Called back and was assured we would get a replacement Calzone at our next order. Fast forward a few weeks. Called in to get our replacement order , informed no record of this on file. I asked for the manager, was informed I was speaking to the manager and he would not honor prior promise. Ridiculous.... Now all we have is bad feeling towards guys, all over not replacing a order THEY screwed up. We will not go back.  Clearly this place is in trouble financially....why else piss off a good customer??Good thing there are a dozen other pizza places within a mile that want our business. .......Disappointed!     ."}
{"text":"Pizza is ok, nothing great. Much better at Valintino's.   My son doesn't like soft drinks, and they refused to give him a glass of water. I had to trek back to the car for his water bottle. So BYOW. Also, they do not give you utensils. Not even the cheap plastic ones.   Really, they can't give out water or plastic knife? It hurts their bottom line? Morons. All it does is p off their customers.  My son likened it to a restaurant run by Mr. Krabs."}
{"text":"I should give them zero stars.  I ordered from their app at 11pm on a Thursday and pre-paid.  My confirmation said 12:15 for delivery.  Fine, it's late I understand.  I called countless times between 12:30 & 1am. Only to be either hung up on or put on indefinite hold.  Finally, at 1:45am the driver called giving countless excuses about 8 orders in the lobby and asking if I was awake and still wanted my order.  Yes, I do.  I paid for it and tipped you already.  I did eventually get two cold and undercooked calzones at around 2am.  Inedible.  Never again.  Who runs a pizza place like this?  Don't offer delivery if you can't handle the orders."}
{"text":"Guys Pizza Co. puts out a good pizza.  I've tried a few of their offerings, including BBQ chicken, pepperoni, cheese, and veggie.  Also tried a veggie deep dish pizza.  All the pizzas are pretty good.  My two favorite pizzas are the BBQ chicken and the veggie.  The pizzas are scratch made and their toppings taste fresh.    Today, I tried a Guys Burger and it was pretty huge.  For $10.99, it had better be a killer burger, right?  It ended up being like a foot long sub cut in half.  I think it was served with two mozzarella sticks and home made potato chips.  The burger was fairly tasty, but it fell apart.  It had large bacon bits, cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayo on it.  I probably won't order it again because it was very unhealthy for me.  I think I'll stick to the pizza from now on, with the exception of a Guy Zone.  I haven't tried the Guy Zones yet, but I will!  This place is right around the corner from my house, so it doesn't get much more convenient.  Recommend!"}
{"text":"I went here last night (Wednesday, 27 September 2017) to grab 2 slices of Pepperoni pizza. I randomly walked in here after attending a Yelp event at the Cleveland Candle Company. I was really hungry and I just wanted something to eat fast.  I give this place a 3.0 rating. The pizza here was good and basic. Nothing fancy. I mean, I was really hungry so maybe my food tasting judgment was clowded but I'm not sure why all the reviews are so bad. I mean, it's just PIZZA y'all. I will definitely say that I've tasted better pizza. I lived in Chicago for 3.5 years so trust me, I know good pizza and I'm not just talking about deep dish pizza.  The crust on Guy's pizza didn't seemed fully cooked at all parts and the red sauce was lacking. I would say that if you're running late and need something to eat real quick then grab a slice here but if you want to sit down with some friends for dinner then go somewhere else. The inside of this place looked old and I read in one review that there are no indoor bathrooms (say whaaat?!?!). Oh well, this pizza joint seems to be a 'order out and go' rather than a sit-in place."}
{"text":"Holy Meatza Pizza !!! We ordered the Guys XL Meatza Pizza last night with the thin crust and it was ridiculously delicious. The toppings were full of flavor and loaded on to edges. The thin crust was not as crunchy as I prefer, but the meat stacked upon this beast of a pizza made up for it. So the XL pizza is freakishly large. I ordered it with hopes of having leftovers, but I never would have thought it would be enough for several days worth!   Delivery was a bit slower than ideal, but they were upfront about the timing. I would definitely give this place a chance if you are looking for a slice of good ol' fashioned greasy goodness."}
{"text":"This is good drunk food haha They are usually open till pretty late and sometimes if you are lucky, they will give you the rest of the pizza, and you don't need to pay more for what you originally ordered for - this actually happened to me and my starved biker friend really appreciated it!"}
{"text":"Was able to get a soda and a slice of pizza for $2.50 just before midnight.  Arrived at the Hyatt Regency at the Arcade too late to order room service, but was starving.  This location was right next door to the hotel.  This is not gourmet food, but for $1.50 a slice and $1 for a can of pop, what can you expect?  The slice was served hot and was just enough calories to get to breakfast."}
{"text":"The only thing I'm gonna say is I haven't been here in a few years it's remodeled and I thought I would try it grab a quick slice . Gentlemen taking a big order 2 other Employees walking around me and another customer stood there for 8 mins never again bad unwelcoming place. Didn't get to order at all!!!"}
{"text":"Day of Week: Tuesday  Time: 6pm   As a resident of Ohio City, I will agree that delivery options in our area are few. I had purchased from Guys while traipsing about downtown and knew that their slices were passable at least, so with my vehicle disabled and choices limited, I gave them a call for delivery.   My son got the Hawaiian pizza, which has ham, bacon, and pineapple \"dusted with brown sugar\" - he really liked it, and after having a bite for the purposes of this Yelp review, I would concur to it's appeal. For my personal tastes, it was a bit over-laden with toppings; Personally, I'd get it with either ham or bacon, but not both.  But if you're going to have a lot of toppings, they'd better taste great when blended together. This pizza definitely earns that description.   I ordered a medium \"Guyzone\" (calzone) with pepperoni, fresh mushrooms and x-tra cheese. It was BIG. The web page says serves 2 or 3 people and yeah, 3 could definitely split the large rectangular slices. For my personal tastes, there was a disproportionate amount of pepperoni and not nearly enough mushrooms to the point that I had to open a slice wide to see *if* there were actually mushrooms at all. Next time I will order \"light pepperoni and double mushrooms\" to correct that issue. So far as extra cheese, I'd say for me there was ... enough cheese, though I don't know that it felt like a mega-amount.   The thing to keep in mind fellow Yelpers, is that when you're doing a review there are Standards... and then there are Your Standards. Personally, I adore mushrooms. I could have an entire grocery store pack on a pizza and be happy. Maybe you, not so much who knows. Maybe your as passionate about pickles or shrimp or tofu.   About Guy's Pizza I can say that the order-taker was friendly and repeated the order before hanging up, delivery was fast - they had quoted 45 min to an hour, and it was only about 30 minutes-ish, and lastly, the product was hot, in one piece, and correct as ordered. So what does that all mean? I'd order again from Guys, yes I would - and more than that, I would recommend them, especially to my fellow peeps in Ohio City as you/we wait for something to be IN our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This location has great, $5 lunch specials. One option is walking in and picking out 3 ready to go slices and a can of soda for $5. You can also get a one-topping small pizza and a soda for $5. But today, I tried the mini calzone special, and I might be hooked! It's a huge portion for $5, and includes any 3 toppings (fillings?) and your choice of dipping sauce.   Fun fact: I once ordered a to-go NY Style pizza for a movie night at my house, and it didn't fit in my car without putting down the seats in my hatchback."}
{"text":"Ordered 5 items for delivery on a Saturday night.  They never gave me an ETA. After 75 minutes the delivery finally arrived. I had ordered fries with my Guyro for an extra dollar but when I opened the box there were no fries (though I did get charged for them). I called them in hopes of getting credited for the screw up but they asked me to hold and forgot about me. I called again a short time later and they claimed to have no record of my order.  After a few more minutes spelling my name repeatedly and more hold time, I was finally informed that the manager would need to speak to me, but he was making the food that night and would have to call me back when they were less busy. He never called back.  On top of all this, my wife's bacon cheeseburger was cold and made with bacon bits.  Avoid!!!!"}
{"text":"0 star place. Ordered it online through yelp, wait more than 1 hour. Called in, rude person tells you he can't help you speed up the delivery. Do Not Ever Order from this trash place. BTW our hotel is 4 min walk from the restaurant."}
{"text":"I won't give this a 5 star rating only because I've never experienced their delivery service. What I have experienced is their $1/slice pizza at 1am. And that is probably the best pizza I've ever had (other than Luigi's in Akron but that's another story). They had pizza already made but it wasn't hard or cold from sitting out too long. Fast, friendly service with complimentary red pepper flakes and mozz cheese sitting out. Great place if you just need a pick me up after a night out."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place is even open.... If you have any health/sanitary concerns don't come here. But if you're wasted and want to fill your belly with a bit of grease... Come on in. People that work here are super Nice. Just don't watch them make your food. Please......ADVICE.... Not on the menu, but order a Buffalo Chicken calzone. Thank me later."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for over 10 years, I was first introduced to guys at a Christmas party when I was a little girl and I fell in love. The customer service has really gone down hill and I even stopped coming for a while but I missed the food so I came back. The food was even hit or miss at one point. I still come because I love the food but it's so sad to see how the service has changed. It would be 5 stars if the service was better."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery on a Friday night.   Pros: fast service, good price ($9.99 for a large pizza)  Cons: the pizza was VERY greasy, there was almost no sauce on it, and the chicken was dry.  I won't be ordering again... still on the search for some good pizza in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Ordered the mammoth 24\" New Yorker tonight for the game.  What a steal for $15.99.  8 HUGE slices of HEAVEN!!  Great pizza from first bite to the last bite.   Their menu has something for everyone.  Subs, wraps, burgers, guyros, guyzones, wings, soups, salads, desserts and PIZZA!   The staff is always friendly and helpful.  I agree with Kari's review about the owner being passionate and very involved.  Customer service is his passion and his efforts are appreciated.   A nice plus to this location is the drive-thru.  Don't forget to collect the proof of purchase on the box and earn a free pizza."}
{"text":"Horrible. Ordered a bacon cheeseburger that comes with fries. The fries are obviously frozen and then microwaved. They are still white & soggy. The burger had 2 patties with under cooked bacon bites in between. Totally gross & would never order from here again."}
{"text":"These \"guys\" don't keep their word. I ordered a pizza that was delivered 2 hours late and cold. I understood that these things happen, and when I called them to let them know, they told me that I would receive a credit for my next order. When I called back for my credit, I was told that it was not in the system. When I asked to speak with a manager, I was told that they do not give the manger's name over the phone. Be careful dealing with companies who do not keep their word, make mistakes and are not accountable for making them. That's not just bad business, it's how you ruin relationships of any kind. All that aside, the pizza is pretty mediocre anyway!! Not with the risk. Move on to a nearby pizza place."}
{"text":"I go to school near Guys and my roommates and I always look for something to eat on those late Friday nights. We've tried this pizza place a couple times throughout the year and always got it delivered. It would ALWAYS take at least 2 hours to get our food and it didn't make a difference if we called in our order, ordered online, or ordered through the Tapingo food delivery app. We usually ordered boneless wings (we always got the hot buffalo) and either a big pizza for all of us to share or a large cheese my bread, or even both. The wings were always delicious, the pizza was not the best but definitely not the worst, and the cheesy bread was always very good. The cheesy bread is kind of made like a pizza in a way where it was in a circle, but it was flatter and had no crust on the end. I would recommend if you're willing to wait a long time for your food."}
{"text":"I'll be honest- I like guys pizza just fine.  The thin crust especially is nice, crispy and tasty.  The salads are ok (I like the buffalo chicken) but it's mostly ice berg and some toppings. Wings are baked, not fried (read: soggy).  Overall though, the food isn't bad, it's pretty respectable considering the type of place it is.   However, the delivery really leaves something to be desired.  Very slow.  I expect to wait an hour plus on a Friday or Saturday night, but two hours on a weeknight??? Nah... Better off picking up pizza somewhere like Deweys, marrottas, pizzazz, mama santas or even whole foods."}
{"text":"I always order from Guys because it's fast and the food tastes good for the price point. However, $6.99 for this salad? That's ridiculous. I also ordered the chicken parm sub. I get that we all have our bad days but there's hardly any sauce on it. I requested no fries but they came anyway with the meal, which would be fine except these fries are cold and stale. Are you kidding me with this order? I won't be ordering from there again."}
{"text":"I always had to order pizza here for my boss and one day, I decided to get one of the calzones. HOLY CRAP!  They are crazy huge! They are the size of my head for less than $8 and you can get a variety of toppings in them!  One thing to make sure to do is to keep the pizza boxes because 10 tags is one free pizza which is super useful!  Service is pretty descent and when I did delivery, they were always on time. One last thing, make sure you"}
{"text":"Pretty much the only decent pizza places that will actually deliver to my downtown apartment are Rascal House and Guy's pizza - Sainato's will too, but I'm not a fan.   Is this the best pizza I've ever eaten? No... but it is decent pizza that delivers to my apartment. And it comes pretty darn fast. This isn't a place I necessarily go to carry-out - since I have a few joints that I frequent for that...  I usually order Guy's in one of three scenarios -     1) I just got home from a long day at work, don't feel like cooking and don't feel like leaving my apt to hunt for food    2) I've had a lazy day at home and the thought of actually going outdoors HURTS.    3) I'm drunk and didn't get any food while I was actually out - and there's a savior named Guy's Pizza that will bring something to my doorstep for me to devour!  #3 is one of my favorite times to call Guy's...  #2 is why I called them yesterday. Word of advice - if you're the only person who will be eating food, do NOT order the new yorker (or read menus carefully so you know what you're ordering). I quicky glanced at the menu - saw \"new yorker\" and assumed it would be thin crust - totally OVERLOOKED the description where it clearly said 24 inches! Aaaand, my jaw dropped when the delivery guy showed up and I saw what's in the picture I uploaded with this review. My security guard said \"woah someone is having a party\" - I just nodded, laughed, and kept walking - SO embarrassing! Basically, if any of you want pizza, I have enough to share for the next week ;) The pizza itself is not thin or crispy enough to really be \"NY\" style. But, it's still delish.   I'm also a fan of their veggie pizza and their veggie sub.   People you talk to on the phone are nice and delivery is usually pretty fast. I was told an hour+ for delivery yesterday and someone showed up about 30 minutes after I called.   I will definitely continue ordering Guy's when I find myself in any of the scenarios above. And remember, know what you're ordering before you order ;)"}
