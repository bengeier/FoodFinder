{"text":"Love this place!!!   I discovered more GREAT news last night... almost ALL of their beers on tap are gluten-free with the addition of that special enzyme that removes gluten to a level that is good for some celiac people and most gluten intolerant people.   WHHHHAAAT!!   I was so excited to enjoy a fabulous dark sour last night and their coffee stout.   Thumbs up!!!!"}
{"text":"Guys, listen. It's Thursday night, I've had a ton of drinks and my tab is like $6. No one else is here. You should all totally be here. They're playing Sugar Ray. This is great."}
{"text":"We discovered the Lakewood location of Bottle House Brewing Company early in the summer and have returned several times. We were thrilled with the delicious and unique craft beer and ale selection-mostly their own brews. Everything we tried was delicious. It is so refreshing to go to a place that offers something other than the standard craft drafts that every other establishment offers. The bartender was welcoming and extremely knowledgeable about his products. I had never tasted mead, so tried one of those as well after the bartender answered my many questions on what it was and how it tasted. We ate there the first time we visited and our meals were both excellent. However, the menu is currently limited and they hope to expand it in the near future.

The owners need to do a website for this location (like the one they have for the Cleveland Heights location) because right now it is a hidden treasure in Lakewood and not easy to find with on-line searches. It's on the corner of Chesterland and Madison. If you like unique, craft brews and meads, you will love this place. I give it 5 stars for the brews, bartender and background music and hope to add another star once they get their menu worked out."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience but i got it resolved very professionally by the onwer. Way to go!!! Will give it a second try!!!"}
{"text":"Great beer and great staff! When they first opened they had a full menu that was well priced and all homemade. 
Unfortunately they have cut this food program and gone to bringing your own food or purchasing popcorn and pretzels. 
The best thing about this place, would be the spaces. There is one in the building that would be so perfect for a rehearsal dinner of under 25 people. 
And, they have a really nice patio out back! 
Go get a beer and head to that patio... it's one of the best in Lakewood! 

Much !!!"}
{"text":"Best St. Paddy's day I've ever had. Excellent vibe and everyone super friendly. Been here for trivia night, crew games but St. Paddy's day took the cake. Will be back for years to come."}
{"text":"Awesome barrel aged sours and their New England IPA is great. They're doing really interesting things you can't find elsewhere in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Apparently only a few weeks old (in their 2nd location) bringing flavors you can't find anywhere else in the country. The staff is friendly, and knowledgeable about their craft. Great beer, great mead, cozy d√©cor. I learned a lot about meads, sours, and goses; enjoyed a fantastic complex stout, and a tasty pretzel. Also had the \"spicy\" brownie, the spice is in a syrup on the plate, I'd rather have it in the mix, but it was good and chocolaty nonetheless!"}
{"text":"This place was super chill. Love the warm and inviting feel when you walk in and the relaxed crowd. They have long tables if you have large parties. The place is much larger than it looks when you walk in, there are rooms with games in them and a semi private seating area in the back. The patio was open, which seems like it will be awesome once its all set up and the weather is warm.The bar is absolutely gorgeous, the detail and design of the wood is so pretty. 

The drinks - They have them displayed on a chalkboard so neatly organized and color coded to help you determine what is what. The selection is large so this is very helpful. They even have the pricing and alcohol percentage listed as well. TRY A MEAD! seriously, these people know how to blend flavors. Things you think \"that sounds weird\" are AWESOME. Make sure to check the percentage of what you order though cause these folks have some high content beers and meads! Did i mention they have sour beers too? Check this place out for a drink before or after dinner at the BBQ place next door! Nice complements of one another."}
{"text":"Super cool spot with a huge selection of mead on tap! Staff was friendly and knowledgeable about their draft selection. 

The popcorn would be awesome if it was free ;)"}
{"text":"I checked this place out on a Tuesday night around 10:30 pm. I live closer to the Cleveland Heights location, but I was over in Lakewood with friends and was excited to check out the *New* Bottlehouse. 

I got a Honeybush saison, and it tastes just like the description reads. It's not sweet so don't let the name fool you. It's refreshing and floral, just like a saison should be. 

I tasted a few of the meads my friends were getting - all of them were very good! I'm not a mead drinker, (I tend to find them a little too sweet for my liking) but these weren't sweet, and that's why I liked them. The Miramar was fun! It's pineapple, mint, and habanero. I know it sounds weird - but it was really good! Not overpowering in any one particular flavor and it totally (honest, I swear) tasted like a mead I'd have enjoyed to the last drop. 

We sat outside since it was such a beautiful night. The patio is big and it's dog friendly. We were able to find a big table to gather around (there were 8 of us in total). Unfortunately, there's no service outside (I don't know if that changes on weekend nights, but during the week, there isn't) - so if you want to re-order you'll have to walk back into the bar - that's not a big deal to me, but I thought it may be worth mentioning. 

The only drawback was the bathroom. The one closest to the patio must not get used as frequently, because of course - when I happened to walk in there, there wasn't any TP. (Um, hello? Guys?) It's a single room stall, so it's not like I can ask the girl beside me if she can spare some. 

I don't go out to an establishment to live as if I'm camping... kinda over that. Please make sure you keep your bathroom stocked with essentials. It was a dead night, so there was no reason that the staff couldn't have done a bathroom check. Know what I'm sayin'?"}
{"text":"I really like this place. Interesting beer selection & also meads, which I wasn't so familiar with. Really liked Alexander's Folly. Tried the flatbread (spicy spinach) which was good, just could've been a bit larger. A friend had the vegetarian/vegan option pasta, which appear to be a large portion with fresh vegetables.
What would really bring me back on a regular basis?  Add a Happy Hour with a buck off drinks, like other places do. And offer tastes  before you choose a beverage that you're not quite certain about. 
I can honestly say that we had great service here, & the bartenders were more than willing to give information out on a beverage, & offer suggestions."}
{"text":"During my last work visit to the Cleveland area - I discovered The Bottle House on Yelp and was intrigued that they brewed beer, cider, and mead! The Lakewood location used to be an Irish Pub. You can still see the name of the Irish Pub in several places inside The Bottle House.

I came in the first time and opted for the following beer sampler:

Travel is Like Love Wedding Ale (5.0% ABV)
Syklist Norwegian Pale Ale (5.0% ABV)
Erie Coast IPA (7.2% ABV)
Fox Devil Wild Golden Belgian Ale (9.5% ABV)
Threads of Fate Porter (5.5% ABV)
Rising Star Coffee Milk Stout (6.5% ABV)

I enjoyed tasting all of the beers. The Norwegian Pale Ale, Erie Coast IPA, and Rising Star Coffee Milk Stout were my favorites. The bartender also brought me a couple of other beers to taste - but I can't recall what they were...

I came back the next night to try a sampler of their Meads:

Barn Brigade Traditional Mead (7.0% ABV)
To Have Cherry Pyment (9.5% ABV)
City Mead Spiced Berry Cyser (9.0% ABV)
Centurion Blackberry Cyser (9.5% ABV)
2014 Vintage Blueberry Blossom Traditional (12.0% ABV)
Miramar Pineapple Mint Habanero (12.0% ABV)

I was not a fan of their Cysers. The Barn Brigade Traditional Mead and the Miramar Pineapple Mint Habanero - which technically I guess is a Melomel - were my favorites.

I had two different bartenders the two nights I visited. Both were nice and helpful. The two nights I visited were weeknights, so it was a little slow in terms of numbers of customers - which gave me the opportunity to engage with the bartenders and ask a lot of questions about the various brews and the brewing process.

Definitely worth checking out if you are in the Cleveland area!"}
{"text":"Asked for sample taste of two beers. Bartender said there is a charge foe samples! No way. Will not be going back. Good breweries do not charge for samples!"}
{"text":"Very nice clean atmosphere with friendly staff . Currently the menu is a bit limited, but the prices were fair and the food was good."}
{"text":"This is fast becoming one of my favorite places for adult beverages on the west side. A few years ago when I visited their Cleveland Heights location, I thought, \"Gee, it would be great if we had this on my side of town.\" Now some genie has granted my wish, and I have easy access to excellent beers, ciders, and meads in one place. I had the opportunity recently to converse with both the mead/cider maker and the brewer, and their passion for their work is obvious and translates to the end products. As a card-carrying beer snob, I'm pleased by their variety of interesting brews. There's something for everyone. And I enjoy their meads and ciders because they are balanced and not too sweet. The bartenders know the products well and are happy to walk you through the lineup. I'm glad this is in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Plz ...just hire a 2nd bartender ; put some ambiance into this place!! A candle on cool long tables; more than 1 tv! Dim the lights and turn up some decent music- blues; dub...! Disappointing vibe for A FRISAY night visit!! And omgosh...clean up the patio"}
{"text":"Such a cool place came for a brew and it's pierogi night. Woooo Hooooo. So first time trying mead, pretty awesomely this mead sweet and packs a punch. The pierogis nice touch. They help soak up the spirits. Hubbys two ravens Baltic Porter is great. Love the atmosphere and the vibe and will certainly return."}
{"text":"First, the owners should realize that their bar/restaurant/meadery doesn't show up with ANY filters. Not easy to find with Yelp. 

The bar is a big one with many unique aspects. You can see the flavors of mead that they are making in the barrels right in the middle of the building. They have a party area in the back that can be reserved and a large patio on the side for summer chilling. They still seem to be behind on finishing the building. The one bathroom has a mirror but it's laying on the ground. 

Know that they don't do mixed drinks. It's either craft beer, mead, or straight liquor. Nothing else. 

I've been here a few times and the service is always fair. It seems a little slow for how few people are actually at the bar, but it's good enough. 

Had one of the flatbreads and it was just the right amount of food while drinking. Came out quickly."}
{"text":"We loved it here. We stopped in after eating across the street at Woodstock and decided to grab a night cap. It was quiet inside and hardly crowded and I really like the inside interior. It's casual but still makes you feel like you are going somewhere upscale. What's nice about this place is you are able to order tastes individually rather than having to order 5 or 6 at once so you can taste as many or as little as you want. We ended up staying a lot later than we expected and had a blast. The bartender Jared was extremely knowledgeable and very friendly. I definitely learned a lot about mead! He made recommendations based on what type of wine or beer we liked. I love it here and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Easily the best-looking building I have ever been to, it was honestly stunning. Unfortunately, this space is entirely wasted as they don't serve food. 1630 on a Thursday night warrants more than 5 customers. 

The beverages were also leaving a lot to be desired. I was expecting something more akin to Nordic mead, sima, or medevukha but the drinks here were either to strong (a la liquor) or common beers and ales. 

It was less than impressive and I think this place would benefit from serving more traditional recipes as well as actually serving food. The owners should take a trip to Rovaniemi, Reykjavik, or Suzdal. It was depressing walking into this exquisite building and seeing it almost empty because this place could easily be 5 stars."}
{"text":"Stopped in on St Patty's as they advertised local sourced Irish Soda Bread and TJs Corned Beef. Our bad, we got here and they were sold out of those. 
This place seems more like a family get together than a community bar. There was a kids party in the one room, barely anyone else the rest. Live Irish music was actually kinda good. Customers at the bar brought their dogs in for some reason. 
No kitchen - No food. The party had crock pots plugged in, should've known. One person walked in with a bag of groceries. 
Customer service was scarce and not great. 
I get it that it's a brewery. Except for the large area with aging barrels you would not know. On St Patty's they didn't think about having Guinness on hand. 
Really not a place I would return. Way too many other choices with food, better atmosphere and better beer selection. 
Keep driving folks. This won't be here long."}
{"text":"Such a great variety of beers, meads and ciders. I find something new I love every time we come here. I don't even like coffee but the coffee milk stout is my favorite milk stout. I also really like that you can bring food in from other places."}
{"text":"I liked the clean, polished yet welcoming atmosphere of the Bottle House Brewing Company's new location in Lakewood and I loved their beers and meads. When it came time to close the tab, I was somewhat taken aback by the $40 bill for two flights, but I guess you get what you pay for?

We stopped into Bottle House early on a Saturday morning to sample their offerings. It's nice to see someone making mead locally! Our bartender was humorous and helpful without being overbearing. He knew his stuff and was happy to answer all of our questions.

We shared two flights and sampled all of the following: Alexander's Folly, Miramar, Empress, Threads of Fate, Yorkshire, Flora, Barn Brigade (Traditional), Forgotten Lore, Ohio Gold, Chorus, Plum City, and Rising Star Nitro. I honestly would have been happy to sample all of their varieties because I really enjoyed everything I tried. Some of my favorites were the Rising Star (delicious, smooth alcoholic coffee), the gose (flavorful and went down way too easily), and several of the mead varieties. The traditional was solid, and I enjoyed the complexity of both Forgotten Lore and Miramar. I'd recommend pulling up the brewing company's webpage if you're interested in knowing a little bit more about each brew while you sample. Their site has some detailed information about the tasting notes for everything they offer.

Although a flight is a great way to sample, I don't think it your best bet here. While some of our sample pours were $2 a piece, most ranged between $3.50 and $4.25 a piece. I'm not saying that what you get isn't quality; it is, but I think the better bet would be to just order the full-sized version of anything you think you'd like to try. Based on my experience, your chances of liking what you ordered are high. Now it'll be my mission to see how long it takes me to head back and try a full glass of each variety!"}
