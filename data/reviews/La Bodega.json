{"text":"Had an awesome lunch today from la bodega. #44 with mayo and chicken corn chowder. Jamie took care of me. She always has a smile even when it's crazy busy and never forgets the little things."}
{"text":"Wow. Had the tuna melt. It was our first time. Will definitely have another sandwich from them again. Little on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Walking through Kensington today and lunched there today. Jerk Chicken & Red Stripe impressed. I will go back and take my significant other. They don't try to do too much. What they do, they do well (limited sample size). Liked the staff - not oppressively nice and seemingly thankful for my business."}
{"text":"First time there for lunch. Picked up a couple subs.

45 Southwestern Sub, Turkey, Bacon, Jalapeno Peppers, Colored Peppers, Tomato, Onion, Spices, Hot Sauce, Cajun Mayo, Jack Cheese
47 California Sub, Turkey, Roasted Red Peppers, Artichoke Hearts, Tomato, Onion, Spices, Garlic-Sun Dried Tomato Mayo, Mozzarella

Loved both of them. If you like a bit of spice the 45 has just the right amount and heat and is packed with flavor. My wife really love the 47!"}
{"text":"Ambiance:
8 tables in the restaurant playing salsa music. We booked ahead for reservations. We were greeted and seated right away. 

Food:
Simple menu where they stress fresh ingredients within 100 km radius. 

Appetizers: Mexican guacamole with homemade corn chips. Great way to start the meal and it was simply delicious! 

Main: chicken roti with rice. $16. 
Roti is rich with spices. Chicken is boneless and served with a generous amount of gravy. Caribbean rice is mixed with red beans. I just loved this dish and the roti passed the muster with my Caribbean-born wife. 

Dessert: ordered the coconut cream cake. 
Not too sweet. Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Mmmmm.  That's all I can say...mmmmm. 

Will definitely be back to try the ox tail. I just love this place."}
{"text":"My partner and I came here to use a Groupon sometime last week. It may be that we came on a bad night, but our experience was certainly not good. When we came in, the restaurant smelled absolutely terrible - perhaps a toilet had overflowed prior to our arrival. I ordered the jerk chicken macaroni and cheese and my partner ordered the burger with sweet potato fries. The burger was pretty good aside from a soggy bun and undercooked bacon, but I'm not sure what exactly happened with the macaroni and cheese. I didn't taste any cheese at all - it seemed to be just noodles with chicken and panko on top - and the chicken was quite bland. Our server was inattentive, which didn't bother us much, but one of the other servers was acting quite strangely and we felt slightly intimidated. We had very high hopes based on the other reviews, but I don't think we will be back due to our own experience."}
{"text":"I want to love this place but I've put in more than my share of second chances and just can't get on board.  Today I got the Californian sub #47. I think the bread is the most important part of any sandwich which is possibly why I wasn't thrilled. It tasted like a grocery store bun at best with no goodness in the middle.  And for $9 something a sandwich I would expect to taste the turkey in between bread and too much mayo."}
{"text":"La Bodega is a hidden gem in Tremont. I often find myself going here to have lunch by myself. It's quaint little place with a couple tables inside. In the warmer months they have picnic tables outside. 

The asiago cheese bread is my favorite! I usually get the #15, with Gouda cheese instead of Swiss and the balsamic mayo. Perfection. I always try to save the second have but end up eating it instead. 

They have a great beverage selection with different pops and teas. The only complaint I have is the price - a little over priced, but the sandwiches are huge and very unique. Depending on who's working, some of the staff don't have much of a personality. However, I find myself continually coming back!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food in Calgary? Fantastic. The quality of the food here is top notch, the drink selection is vast and the service is very welcoming and friendly. Even the clientèle that were in the restaurant were welcoming, making recommendations when going over the menu.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Very good wraps from this cool spot in Tremont.  Easy to get in and out of.  I only picked up and carried out.  It was a 90 degree day and I don't think they had air in there so I am not sure how comfortable it would be to eat in.  As far as the food goes, it is simple and fresh ingrediants that are priced well.  I reccomend."}
{"text":"Great fusion of Mexican and Caribbean flavours. Blackened basa was tender and juicy and a big portion with rice vegetables and coleslaw. Bodega tacos are their signature dish-delicious mango salsa tops them off. Prices are extremely reasonable. The friendly waitress and the owner chef are very welcoming.  It was a wonderful find this evening"}
{"text":"I really want to love this place.  I adore their wide variety of sandwiches, and especially their extensive list of vegetarian sandwiches.  I have not had a bad experience with their sandwiches yet.

I do however, have a problem with the staff.  I recently went in at 3:30 on a Saturday.  A blazing hot Saturday and was looking forward to some respite in the air conditioned dining room.  I was disappointed that upon our arrival, we were told that the dining room was closed in anticipation of them closing at 4.  They had already cleaned it, so we had to take it to go or sit out in the sun.  Now, I was in the restaurant industry for 6 years.  Never, NEVER, were you allowed to pull a stunt like that.  If a customer walked in at 4:02, you still let them come in and sit down if they wanted to.  The fact that we came in a full 30 minutes before they were closed and were told to leave was sad.  I couldn't help but wonder if the owners knew about this kind of behavior towards paying customers...."}
{"text":"sandwiches are amazing every time...very fresh ingredients, quality bread. whenever we eat in, we're always approached and asked how our food tastes. a nice touch and you can tell they really go the extra mile to give you awesome sandwiches and excellent service."}
{"text":"Goat curry was great. My friend had the jerk chicken mac and cheese.  Expected less diner-type atmosphere more funky upscale. I guess I was mislead by the advertising."}
{"text":"Good but salads are overpriced for what you're getting in. Would recommend they drop price lbs Salads or include a small soup or something. Just a bowl of lettuce and small amount of veggies and choice for $12. With drink $13. Not cool. Staff is cool though."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here one night when we were freezing and hungry, the restaurant is clean and welcoming. The man we chatted with ( either an owner or manager) was incredibly friendly and helpful, he made us feel right at home. The food was quick and delicious, I'm not typically a fan of Mexican and I was amazed by the beef tacos. Best food I've tasted in quite a while! Such a wonderful experience overall! We've returned again since and we were recognized and greeted by the same friendly staff. This will become a regular place for us."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience. Took my  pre-teen who was worried about the spice level of the mac and cheese. The chief came out and had her try the sauce. Then when it was ready came out again and told her if it was too spicy he would make her a new one.  Beet salad was marvolous as was the burger.  Service was good as welll."}
{"text":"The menu here is huge, and they have a great vegetarian selection :D I've had a few hummus wraps, you can live on one for about a week, they are HUGE. Today I got the #63 Grilled Swiss, Mozzarella, Provolone plain (they usually put tomato, onion ,spinach, and mayo) and when I got back to work I noticed it was not plain. I called up expecting to have to go back to pick up a new sandwich, but the girl offered to deliver it right to me. She also gave me an extra bag of chips and a cookie. So great! The #63 is ooey and gooey and just super delicious.

They also have the best balsamic vinaigrette I've ever tasted and the most divine homemade croutons!

(PS my review is for the La Bodega on Superior that just opened up not the Tremont location)"}
{"text":"Just wanna add a couple of sandwiches I'd recommend since my last review:

-The #56: Roast Beef, French Fried Onions, Tomato, Mozzarella, BBQ Mayo - are you kidding me?!??! So good.

- The #41 (vegetarian): Mushrooms, Spinach, Havarti, Tomato, Onion, Pesto Mayo, Rosemary Ciabatta. This is pretty much what I get every time now."}
{"text":"What's Not to love about a place that makes sandwiches?!! They have many sandwiches to choose from whether you are a meat or veggie lover."}
{"text":"Best lunch option in tremont. Its that simple.  Sandwiches are creative and they do NOT skimp you on the meat. I have to say that i often have trouble finishing my entire sandwich. Turkey #27 is a mainstay and highly recommended + roasted red pepper and on the asiago cheese bread. Sandwiches come with Lays (baked or full-fat). The only drawback is that the sandwiches tend to come HEAVY on the mayo, do yourself a favor and always ask for it on the side."}
{"text":"Finally, finally have found a great roti here in Calgary. My taste buds are singing in joy! 
Wonderful dinner at Bodega!
Can't say enough great things about this restaurant! I'm in heaven and will definitely be back to enjoy everything on the menu."}
{"text":"La Bodega is a nice place in the Tremont area. I was looking for a sandwich and found this place as rated very high by fellow yelpers. 

I ordered their veggie pizza sub. It was huge, I ate it for lunch and dinner. It was very nice and juicy. I loved it. 

The place has some very weird art on display bot other than that the staff is very friendly. 

I will be coming here often."}
{"text":"Bodega now doing breakfast!

Again with the generous proportions, good variety of items and (I feel like I'm stealing) low prices. I've enjoyed breakfast here twice, and I've been back for lunch or dinmer 4 or 5 times already. 

Bodega is fast becoming one of my staple frequent flyer destinations. As I say, why risk food poisoning by staying home and cooking for myself, when I can dine out?! And at Bodega it's that much better--value is there, and the friendly host provides better company than staying home, alone. Just me and my whiny dog."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here a few times.  It might not seem like much when you walk in, but the food is pretty darn good.  I'd eat there a whole lot more, but it seems like they're closed a lot of the time when I want to go there.  They have great sandwiches, and they're huge, yet somehow I can always finish mine."}
{"text":"I went to bodega on the second day of its soft opening. I had the soap of the day had great flavour and spice, the burger which was very juicy and tasted amazing as well as having very thin crispy yam fries to go with it bringing it all together and I had a chocolate coconut cake also very good. The ambience and staff were very nice and did a very good job. I would recommend you go down and check this place out it is totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Awesome eats and a great, friendly staff.  Really big menu.  Love the Rosemary Ciabatta bread with turkey, smoked Gouda, sprouts and balsamic mayo.  Definitely one of my new fave places!"}
{"text":"I think I got unlucky, since the pictures here show a nicely blackened chicken for the jerk. I ordered the Roti with Beef and the Jerk chicken and both weren't well cooked. The jerk chicken wasn't dark and grilled enough and the beef wasnt cooked for long enough hence was a little tough. I'd give them a second chance, if they contacted me through yelp to come again to redeem themselves, but it was a bit of a disaster. Me and my wife are big jamaican foodies, and have tried most places in Calgary and were excited to see one in Kensington, but with the quality i had today, I can safely say that it's the worst jamaican place in Calgary."}
{"text":"Being that I am a transplant from California, I miss all the little salad cafés we had to choose from. I found La Bodega on Yelp and decided to give it a chance. I'll admit, the Tremont neighborhood was exactly where this place should be. Hipsters flock to areas like these. This café is definitely a hip little spot. The neighborhood is super cute too. 

Small, but mighty. The restaurant is very small. One half is the kitchen and the other half, small tables and a few tables outside to enjoy your food. #52 - It was seriously one of the best salads I've ever had. Chicken, cranberries, toasted walnuts, tomatoes, blue cheese and balsamic dressing over a bed of romaine was my idea of a filling lunch. Everything else looks amazing, so I'll definitely be back. I'm a creature of habit sometimes, so I'll probably order the #52 again though ha ha."}
{"text":"Excellent little sandwich shop on the near Westside. Plenty of hot and cold sandwiches to choose from and they have space inside or outside if you want to sit down and eat. I usually get the #27 but surely plan on trying other sandwiches since its so close to where I work.

Good friendly staff and the food is made to order hot, fresh and quickly."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are consistently made and delicious. It's a casual place with good prices. I always take my sandwich to go, so I can't speak to the dining experience, though I know the dining room is small. They do have outdoor seating for nice days. The people are always friendly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love the food here. Have been there a couple times now and both have been amazing. First time there I had the Creole Shrimp Salad and it was beyond delicious. Just the right amount of all the ingredients. I highly recommend it. Second time there I had the Jerk Chicken Mac and Cheese.  So so so good. Creamy, cheesy and just the right amount of heat. Will definitely be back. Keep up the good work Bodega."}
{"text":"My go to lunch spot when I am at work. I love their salads, especially their Southwestern Salad w/chicken. The service has always been fast and friendly, usually the same girl working behind the counter. 

Their is some seating in the back and I never had an issue finding a spot. My only negative is that it is on the pricy side but most of my sandwiches and salads have been split into 2 meals so when you look at it that way, it's not a bad price at all."}
{"text":"I like La Bodega. Located in center of Tremont and easily accessible. I called my order ahead and young woman was very nice. I had Turkey on Asiago Cheese bread with carmelized onions, smoked gouda, sprouts, and a mayo that was nicely balanced with the sandwich. Anyway, I have been working from home recently and this place is nice for a quick carryout. I will be back for nice vegetarian options. Give me a hug if you see me at La Bodega. I'm recovering from surgery."}
{"text":"Went to this place as I live in Sunnyside and purchased a Groupon for it. My husband and I went for our date night and ordered three tacos to start, which were pretty great. My entrée was the jerk chicken and his was the curried beef roti. Service was very personable, however slightly forgetful as my entrée came out after I had to remind her that I had ordered it. The menu isn't huge, but the server did mention that it is going to expand. Overall, I think this place has good potential and would go back again."}
{"text":"The quality of turkey they use is not very good....took it off and ate the rest. The bread on the sandwich was great. But for the price I thought they would use better meat."}
{"text":"The only real glaring positive of La Bodega is their bread.  The bread is the very foundation of a sandwich.  What disappointed me most was that after the bread everything else was just average.  

I had the Italian (#44), and felt as though for the $9 price there should have been a bit more of the meats and veggies loaded between the wonderful bread.  This may be the first time I've ever said this about a sub sandwich, but the fillings were what dragged down the quality of the bread here.  99.9% of the time it's the other way around.

The staff was also very friendly, and had patience as I tried to analyze their extensive menu.  They also have a nice selection of craft sodas to wash down your meal.

I'm torn between 2 stars and 3 three on this one, and am only giving it a 3rd star because of the bread and the friendly staff.

If you find yourself in Tremont during lunchtime I suppose it'd be a good stop since there doesn't seem to much open during that time, but I'd just as rather drive a bit farther for some better valued options."}
{"text":"#152

Jim, the owner is awesome (God, I hope I got his name right).

Soft opening, 15% off, walking down 10th St NW in the snow, and hungry. The stars have aligned.

Grand opening, Tuesday, 26 January!

Hours:

Closed Mondays
Tuesday - Friday: 1130am to 2pm
Tuesday - Thursday: 430pm to 10pm
Friday: 430pm to 1am
Saturday: 1130am to 1am (open all day)
Sunday: 1130am  to 9pm

For $8 and some change, get the pictured Mac and Cheese. Soft and slightly spice jerked chicken lightly crumbed. Cooked to a perfect temperature with just the right amount of mac and cheese as related to the amount of jerked chicken. No over-powering of flavours here. Talk about comfort in a bowl. I did not lick the bowl since there were other customers. Good portion size; excellent delivery!

Also, try the jerked chicken with coconut rice as well (also pictured). Soft moist chicken over a bed of soft coconut rice. This was my friends dish and I only nibbled on it!

Newly opened but old school flavours!

Friendly atmosphere and great service to boot!

Coming back here for sure!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick lunch place in the Tremont area and was excited to find this sandwich shop! The southwestern sub was recommended and did not disappoint! Definitely will check out this place again."}
{"text":"I found La Bodega as I was wandering around Tremont one afternoon. Like the previous reviewer, I was impressed by the sandwiches! It was one of the most delicious sandwiches I've ever had. Lots of leafy greens and good dressing/sauce. Now I'm thinking when I'll head over to the west side next so that I can eat one of these sandwiches..."}
{"text":"A cute lil restaurant which a group of us happened upon only because the wait at Lucky's Cafe was out of control and because apparently this is the only other place that opens in Tremont before 12PM on a Saturday.  Seriously?!

I can speak for everyone in our group by saying that the food was great.  My Italian sub in particular was delicious.  I would definitely get it again.

I was a bit turned off by the slow service (15 minutes for 3 subs and a salad?!), which I overlooked for the most part while catching up with friends, and I was a bit turned off by the price.  $9.75 for an Italian sub and a bag of chips?  Eek.  Maybe I am a bit spoiled by Bari's (Chicago) $6 footlong Italian sub that doubles as two meals, but I still found this to be a bit pricey.  I bought for the SO, and two subs, two bags of chips, and two cans of pop came to $23+.  Yikes.

When in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"This place is sweet! I tried their special sandwich of the day - veggie grilled cheese. It had cheese, spinach, tomatoes, and lots more delicious veggies. The sandwiches are huge so you'll definitely have some left overs! Can't wait to try more sandwiches and soups from this place."}
{"text":"meh.

first of all, these subs sure are unnecessarily pricey.  and i'm not a $5 footlong gal.  i'll pay good money for a sandwich but the price can only be high if the sandwich is GOOD.  which brings me to point #2...

these sandwiches just don't have a lot going on.  i had the pizza sub, half of which i ate yesterday and the other half of which i ate today for lunch.  it wasn't terrible, just bland and boring.  it's tough to make melting, gooey cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms and marinara bland but congrats, La Bodega, you've done it!   also, it was a little light in the meat and filling department, i.e., 75% bread, 25% meat/cheese.  i definitely felt gipped."}
{"text":"La bodega is one of my favorite places to go for a quick lunch!!! However, you have to know what to order when you come here. 

Their service is five stars. Accurate,Friendly and fast. That's all I need!

The salads are five stars. If heaven created salads, they would taste like la bodega's. I love that they load their salad up with fixings. I typically get #51 or 52. But I'll talk to you about #52. I've never seen a salad with such generous portions of blue cheese, walnuts, cranberries and shredded chicken. The quality of the ingredients is awesome! The lettuce (and accompaniments) is always super fresh.

Their wraps are also amazing. Any kind Chicken salad- you can't go wrong. 

Other sandwiches, like grilled cheese, I have not been very impressed with at all. I've also gotten tomato soup which tasted like tomato water with dried herbs.  Two stars there. 

Moral of the story, you'll be rewarded for choosing the healthier salad option at this joint! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Decided to start our evening here with friends for dinner. It had a welcoming atmosphere, there was a dj spinning, open kitchen concept and the place was busy but not so loud that we couldn't enjoy our conversations. Great wine list (totally affordable) and the cocktails were to die for with a big list of fun drinks to choose from. I went in thinking I was just going to have a salad by which I chose the creole shrimp salad, it was phenomenal. It was authentic creole heat with the plantain balancing all out. My girlfriends also had the pattys which I ended up eating as well because they were too delish.  They ordered the jerk mac & cheese which I also ended up eating most of too.  The way I described it was comfort food. I felt like I was at my west indian friends mom's house eating that dish that I'll never be able to recreate at home. It was so good my friend got another one to take home. 
To boot the staff was friendly, our waitress was sweet and attentive. The whole resteraunt essentially felt interactive. Thanks so much for the experience,  will back very soon!"}
{"text":"I ate at the on Superior Ave.  I got chefs salad soup drink $25.00.  Very much over priced for the food. Salad was bland even with horrible blue cuz that had not taste.  The onion soup was ok but microwaved.  The decor and people were nice that's why it's a 2.  Other wise. Good wise. 1."}
{"text":"My coworker and I decided to order pick up from Bodega for lunch, I had the ceser salad with chicken  and she had the chicken tacos. We both were pretty underwhelmed and disappointed in the food. My salad was soggy because of how much dressing they put in it. My coworker couldn't bring herself to finish the tacos as it had so much rice and a little chicken in it."}
{"text":"La Bodega. I wish you were downtown. But since I love to use my lunch to shop on occasion your location is perfect!

I leave work at 12noon. I get into my car. I call and place my order. By the time I find the quickest way there (crazy bridge construction) I arrive and my meal is all set and ready to go!!!!!!! LOVE!

Everyone is extremely friendly and everything is fresh and my portion sizes are enough for 2 meals. If it makes it that far...

Today I went for the #20 + hot sauce + plain chips so scoop out the extra hummus. Chk the menu and find your fav!"}
{"text":"This review applies to the new ASIA TOWN location- Our office had high hopes for this location as there are only a few good places to grab a sandwich in this area and we could use some variety. I was really bummed about my sandwich. I ordered the #40- It's supposed to be: tomato, fresh mozzarella, fresh basil and pesto mayo. 

What I received: a mayo sandwich with some thinly sliced tomato, two of the smallest basil leaves I have ever seen and ONE, small, thinly sliced piece of fresh mozzarella for the WHOLE sandwich. The sandwich is cut in half so I basically had one tiny half-moon slice of cheese on each side of the sandwich and sadly only one side got the baby basil leaves. 

I am not looking for a jaw breaker here, but I would have liked each half to have enough ingredients on it to count as an actual sandwich. I would have also preferred that they not try to compensate for the lack of main ingredients with mayo. Officially, the #40 if you are interested, should be listed as a mayo sandwich garnished with some tomato. I would leave the basil out of the description completely."}
{"text":"Best burrito I've found so far in Calgary. Always friendly service here and never a long wait. Definitely one of my favorite spots for a satisfying lunch in the downtown/Kensington area."}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is very authentic Mexican,  food is always fresh and delicious and the owner is so friendly!!!   If he could get licensed you would have to beat people off with a stick to get in. Keep up the awesome work!  Kensington + Mexican = Bodega"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch--seems a little pricey but you definitely get a bang for your buck with large sandwiches and chips -- portions are great."}
{"text":"Had the Italian it was great and it was massive!!!
The bread was fresh also - loved the location being close to my office in downtown Cleveland I will definitely return"}
{"text":"We found this place by accident and we thought it was a hidden treasure.  It's hard to notice this restaurant along 10th Ave. in Kensington. The entrance is not very eye catching especially with other restaurants in the area. It's a quaint little place which we liked. Our server talked to us in Espanol translating himself to English after! My Spanish is very limited but I thought that was fun! The food was awesome. Very delicious and tasted authentic ! We  thought it was good for the price as well.  We liked the friendly service and the cute ambiance. We will come back here again to try their other dish!"}
{"text":"Overall an average experience.  Food was good - nice flavours, good sized portions.  Service was average.
Atmosphere is ok at best.  It is a tough space to make warm and inviting.  Artwork on walls leaves me questioning taste of owner/manager...it can easily be defined as misogynistic.  Wouldn't recommend place if you have kids of a questioning age or if you want to take your conservative granny."}
{"text":"I loved it here! Sometimes you just want a damn good sandwich with some quality ingredients, made the way you want it-- and La Bodega fits the bill perfectly! Everyone was so sweet and friendly in here. You can tell that they love what they are doing (they probably could have served me a pb&j on white bread and it would have tasted great.) I got the #52 which is a salad but they offered to make it into a wrap for me because I was in the mood for a handheld. It was delicious- pulled chicken, bleu cheese, cranberry, crisp lettuce. Yum! Don't overlook La Bodega for your next lunch!"}
{"text":"First off, I'm actually a little surprise there are some negative reviews for this little Tremont gem. I just love la bodega. I live and work in Tremont so this a very frequent lunch spot for me. The service is VERY quick and totally consistent. I've tried a large variety of sandwiches and salads. Their chicken salad wrap will absolutely blow your mind. The BLT is exactly what you would want from a BLT. But my go to sandwich is always the number 48. It's the most perfect grilled cheese with bacon and tomato. The only reason for the four star rating is because they offer soup...and it's nothing more then mediocre. For a place that really has the sandwich shop thing down, I think they should either offer a damn good soup of the day to go with your amazing sandwich, or don't offer it at all. All in all, I'm so very happy this place exist in my wonderful little neighborhood."}
{"text":"Jerk chicken - nice people. It's Caribbean food joint that doesn't stick to tradition, but doesn't get too crazy with the fusion either. It's a delicious equator mix that doesn't exist anywhere else in Calgary (as far as I know.) - all at a very approachable price point. Of course you're going to want to wash that tasty food down with a beer, and they've got a small selection of Village brews.

It's a good place to go for a casual dinner and they've got table service. I don't think the feel of the place really suits the food. But I also think there's a certain authenticity that comes with having a space that hasn't been decorated to the 9's around some sort of a theme. I see myself ordering a huge amount of takeout coming from here in the future."}
{"text":"I don't think there's gonna be much cause for me to ramble on too much in this here review. You see, the thing is La Bodega is a sandwich shop. That's it. Nothing more nothing less. OK, maybe just a little more. They do offer salads, after all.

I hadn't been here before but I'd often found myself wondering about it as I'd drive by. Speaking of driving by, they'd really benefit from some kind of outside signage. The place is practically unmarked and unless you look right at the front door you'd have no clue what it was.

The menu is just as I explained earlier - sandwiches and salads - all made fresh while you wait. I don't recall which day it was on our visit but there wasn't another soul in the shop, just me, my wife and the two workers. Maybe it was the because it was so close to Thanksgiving. Whatever the case, it was pretty quiet. Back to the menu. La Bodega offers ten different breads and dozens of different sandwich options. You'd be hard pressed not to find something that'd tickle your jimmies.

As for drinks, it's all about the pre-packaged variety here. Water, iced teas, pop, the usual suspects. Not too many non-sweetened options, though. That kinda bummed me out. Now for the sandwiches. I seem to remember they offer little sides of cole slaw and the like, but I could be wrong.

NOTE: All sandwiches come with a bag of chips. 

I went with the #22 - Roast beef with Havarti cheese, tomato, red onion and horseradish mayo on multigrain bread. A pretty damn good sandwich, although a bit heavy on the red onion. Nothing a little pickin' off couldn't solve. The bread was fresh and so were the ingredients.

My other half enjoyed the #32 - Curry chicken salad wrap. Creamy curry-spiced chicken salad dotted with raisins and all rolled up snug-like with some lettuce, tomato, and onion. I thought it could have used a bit more heat, but that's just me. She dug it.

La Bodega is what it is. A little sandwich shop in Tremont. They probably do most of their business carry-out judging by the tiny eat-in space and they support local art because it's hanging all over the walls inside (and it's all for sale). The guy at the counter was pretty friendly. I think that's about it. If you're looking for a good sandwich and you happen to be wandering around Tremont, La Bodega will hook you up. Next time you want Subway, come here instead."}
{"text":"I want to really like La Bodega.  I really do.  Sandwiches are awesome ad they have a ton of great sandwiches.  I just wish.... I don't know.  I wish they had higher quality ingredients.  The sandwiches are missing something.  

The bacon on the BLT is very thin and never crispy, at least in my experiences.  The egg salad is missing something and doesn't have much flavor.  Don't get me wrong their other sandwiches may be amazing but those are the ones I have ordered.  

I go back hoping it was just a fluke and for a quick sandwich I probably will continue to go back.  I'll try other menu items and update accordingly."}
{"text":"The staff is always so friendly. Food is reliably great. I've never been disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Wam-Bam-Thank you delicious, huge, glorious sub sandwich. 

I met the boyfriend here today for lunch for the first time ever and all I'm going to say is, \"Good choice my man, damn-good choice,\"

The southwest sub is really where it's at--grilled bread, turkey, jalapenos, various peppers, jack cheese and hot sauce. I'm physically drooling right now even though I'm still full from eating only half of this monster.

You like sandwiches? Subs? Delicious-ness? Go here. Quick making excuses and bookmark it already. 

It's super easy to order and eat in, or take it to go. There's a huge cooler with tons of teas, juices and sodas for drankin'. I mean, can this place get any better for a quick lunch on the run? 

I can't wait to go back when it's warmer and sit out on the picnic tables with my man and my pup. I also love how everyone has their own # that they prefer. Maybe next time around I'll try one of the other hundreds of awesome varieties they have. (You know how my huge menu anxiety goes...)

Sandwich heaven here, folks. Welcome to sangwich mecca."}
{"text":"My number one lunch place. I will find any excuse to swing by here and pick something up! Not a vegetarian, but my favorites here are the Veggie Pizza sub and Eggplant sub. Because who needs meat when these subs are so good? I also love the location it is in, I usually make a trip here and then browse around the library for a few. Perfect lunch!"}
{"text":"La Bodega is great! The sandwiches are wonderful, and I'm glad that they survived the gas explosion, and came back strong! 

I've tried many sandwiches and have been happy with each one!  #27 (turkey, smoked gouda, balsamic mayo) is amazing, as are all of their chicken salad varieties ranging from Curry to Sun Dried Tomato."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  I do not eat meat and they have very creative options for meatless sandwiches.  There is one girl that works there that is way friendlier than the others.....if everyone acted like her, this would have been an easy 5 stars.  I think the prices are extremely reasonable....for $6 I get a spinach, tomato, onion, mushroom, walnut, cream cheese and honey sandwich on fantastic asiago - plus a bag of chips."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are all excellent! The service is good as well. My husband wants to move in upstairs so he can eat here every day. Try anything with the pesto, for sure. My man had ham pineapple Brie and honey mustard, and was blown away!"}
{"text":"We were in here a few days ago and the food is amazing. The chicken burritos are so good and filling. The service is really friendly and the food came out so fast. The whole restaurant and all the tables were very clean. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"La Bodega is down the street from my house and has slowly become my staple for when I don't feel like cooking after work.  The subs are huge and can easily fill a person up for at least two meals.  That is how I justify spending $8-10 bucks for a sandwich.  
My favorite is the California sub with turkey, marinated artichokes and a delicious garlic/sun dried tomato mayo.  It's served on crisp french bread and put in the panini press.  
The chicken salad is good as well, and served in a wide variety of options.  
The menu is a bit extensive so it'll take me a while to work through it, although I keep ordering the same thing over and over. 
They also have a pretty good list of vegetarian options available as well as an interesting variety of pop, iced teas and waters.
The decor has that trendy mom and pop vibe and the workers are always very friendly."}
{"text":"Great service and wonderful food. I like the shrimp salad! Will come back."}
{"text":"Yum! Love this place. Big sandwiches for a great price. I always get more than one meal when I order here! I always get the California- it's the best! turkey, artichoke hearts, sweet red pepper mayo, provolone cheese, and some zesty seasonings all toasted to perfection. Doesn't get any better."}
{"text":"As an architecture student, we have to visit the sites we are designing on. During one of those site visits, We saw this place with my friends and decided to give it a shot. Other than being a little pricey, the food tasted good."}
{"text":"Rosemary ciabatta roast beef sandwich is my fav! It's a cute little shop, for simple and fast service. I was a little nervous when I first tried this place out....in my head I was worried it would be like any ordinary Subway sandwich kind of deal, but actually the flavors were solid. I loved the blend of herbs on the bread and sizable meat portion they used for their sandwich. I also tried their potato and chive soup, which was delicious. The soup wasn't overly creamy or rich, which was good because I can only take a certain amount of heavy soups like that. The meal was solid and worth the price, so if you are in the neighborhood and want a quick bite this is definitely a good place to stop by and try out."}
{"text":"The Staff were SUPER friendly. The owner came over to our table and introduced himself. He asked us what we had ordered for our kids, when we told him that they were going to split the Jerk Mac & Cheese (because they didn't have a kids menu) he informed us that the jerk chicken would be way too spicy so he told the kitchen to leave it off and give it to us to take home. He was very attentive and clearly cared that we had a good time. I found my taco trio to be a bit spicy for my liking, but that's just me. My husband loved the bacon cheeseburger he had ordered. And the guacamole was delicious. We will return to try other menu items, my only wish is that there was a childrens menu (with milder options)."}
{"text":"La Bodega is one of those places that I always meant to visit. Now that I've done it, I feel dumb I haven't been eating here sooner. Tucked on the corner of Jefferson Avenue are some of the tastiest, most affordable sandwiches in the area. I was just telling a friend recently that I spend a lot of time in Tremont, but I'm not always up for the expensive fine dining. Enter: La Bodega. My new favorite.

Yes, as others stated, this is a small sandwich shop. But really, does one need a Marie Antoinette style seating arrangement for sandwiches? No. Just grab a seat in the cozy back area adorned with local art or settle outside on one of the small bistro tables. La Bodega has a huge menu (see my photos!) with plenty of options for all dietary restrictions and taste buds. But not to mention, their menu is just crave-worthy! I'm not one of those people who ever *craves* a sandwich, but La Bodega changed my mind. I had the #30 Chicken Salad wrap with Lemon-Almond, Lettuce, Tomato, and Onion. It was huge and delicious. This chicken salad felt healthy, had a great lemon/almond flavor, and had me full for hours. I forget the number (#46?), but my friend loved his pizza style sub.

Oh, and on the way out, the owner (I think), said, \"Have a great day, thanks for coming in, Lauren.\" Now, 9/10, I usually introduce myself when I visit a new business. But on this day, it was a million degrees, I probably looked crazy and was slightly grumpy, so i'm not even sure if I introduced myself. It caught me off guard in the best way possible. What nice people! I'll be back very soon!"}
{"text":"I used to live in Tremont and La Bodega was a weekly ritual. They have a huge selection of sandwiches. It is always so hard to choose because they are all amazing. If you're in the Tremont area this is a must stop!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The people are so friendly!! I ordered the tacos dorados to go and was so impressed. I couldn't even take a photo because I was so excited. This food was so fresh. Taco shells frying as I waited. It was delicious! I cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"When I think of a bodega i don think sandiwch shop, but sure.  Good, fresh ingredients.  Super close to the crib and keep pretty good hours.  Im glad to see they werent too affected by the house explosion next door.  I come here once and a while only because its just a tad expensive for a luch/sandwich.  Every time I leave outa here its in the 15 dollar range.  Kinda reminds me of the old Take A Bite..good but overpriced.  I guess thats Tremont for ya.  Cater to the 10% of rich people who live here.  For 15 bux I can get a 40 and a massage at the rub-and-tug down the street!  I will be back...just after my \"massage\""}
{"text":"I'd lived in Tremont for three month without realizing that La Bodega was right around the corner from my place - & what an omission of knowledge! I work from home, & I've been scrounging for lunch every day, when I could've been eating every sandwich on the planet.

La Bodeg'a menu is vast, with lots & lots of sandwich options to choose from. I wouldn't say that any of them are, for the most part, extremely creative or shocking or amazing, but they serve literally any \"old standby\" you can think of. Whatever your comfort sandwich is, La Bodega serves it, or they can probably make it up for you. I'm a big fan of the #26 without tomato, a tuna melt that I order on wheat bread. Bonus: All sandwiches come with chips.

The service is friendly & fast, & there's a little bit of indoor seating for those whose living room isn't 50 steps away, like mine. It's decorated with local art, & you can browse fliers & papers & other info from local businesses & events while you wait for your food. La Bodega feels like a true neighborhood joint - & I feel lucky to have them in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Decent little dive to grab a sandwich or pasta salad. My fav is the cran-mayo dressing on the turkey sandwich."}
{"text":"Love this place..  Been here many times.  Dave did an amazing job with the menu selections.  My fav by far are the fish tacos.  They are amazing and I crave them every time.  I love the gluten free selections and that everything is made to order and fresh.  Out of town friends who I bring in are impressed with the flavors and the friendliness off the staff."}
{"text":"I've ate here a couple times now and every time I have definitely been satisfied. It's solid 4 star place and I can't see why anyone would disagree. A little quiet looking on the outside, it'd probably be hard to find if you didn't already know it's on the corner. For some reason, I love the goofy artwork on the walls- I want it all (which I suppose I could do since its for sale). Go look at it even if you don't eat anything it'll make your day 100% better. Anyway, solid sandwich shop. I've had the southwestern (love) and Italian sub (also great) as well as a massive salad. The portions are great! Big enough to be like: yeah, I can probably get two substantial meals so maybe I won't eat the whole thing and fell sick later sized. I haven't really experienced the overly friendliness of the staff that some have mentioned but that doesn't bother me. With the subs at least, the bread can kind of take over the rest of the ingredients and I end up ripping half of it off. They come with the choice of of regular, bbq, or baked chips but unless there's SALT AND VINEGAR CHIPS (please I beg of thee) I'd rather have them not be included and save a little $. I do think some of the ingredients (boiled eggs on salad and meats) could be of better quality, especially in the \"crunchy\" confines of the tremont / ohio city / hingetown area, but le bodega is a solid choice and if you like spicy the southwestern sub will probably change your life. I realize this review sounds more negative than I intended, those are just the stopping from 5 star points in my eyes. The sandwiches are great, forget subway and jjs and come here instead!"}
{"text":"Just a great local sandwich shop.  The sizes are big enough not to make you too full on your lunch hour AND you get a bag of chips!  I love taking friends here for the first time and listening to them rave about how delicious the food is.  One of the biggest reasons I miss living in Tremont is because of this place.  I'd become a regular if they had one on the east side.  The only down side is they close early but that's probably because of all the bars in the area take up the parking."}
{"text":"When I actually drove downtown for work, this was my escape for lunch. Love the staff, very friendly. Sandwiches are delicious and filling."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday and the food was so good! Huge servings and beautiful presentation! Can't wait to try more off the menu. Staff was extremely sweet! Located on a very cool looking street too, lots of ethnic food options, outdoor patios, and nice sight seeing for strolling  through the block. Photos include sopes, tacos, and jerk chicken Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"This place is the place to hit up for sammiches in the Cleveland area.  Nice people, amazing sandwiches with lotso veggie options and you can eat half and take half home for dinner, they're that big.  Try the #58 or any of the roast beef options if you're a hearty type or if you like to take naps after lunch.  Finish this off with a iced green tea so you can burn one-eightieth of the calories you just ate up.  Mmmmm doesn't matter.  The owner is super-nice and always thankful you've come in, unlike some other sub shops in Cleveland.  This is a must if you're in and around the Tremont area and want a sandwich-type lunchtime bonanza of taste in your mouth..."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing sandwiches/subs.  I believe that the last time I went I got the #45 and it was out of this world.  It blows away any chain restaurants such as Subway or Quizno's.  I never thought that I would ever fantasize about sandwiches, but that's what happens after you get one from La Bodega.  I had actually temporarily forgotten about this place until I thought to check for it on Yelp.  I must return soon... today perhaps..."}
{"text":"Partner and I were happy to see Caribbean section on the menu including roti, which is hard to find in Calgary. We both got beef roti, which is decently priced (for Calgary, insanely overpriced for Toronto, sigh) and comes with a side of rice/beans+cole slaw or a side salad that has the interesting ingredient of cantaloupe. 

Roti arrives and it's weird from the first moment, because it has a sauce on top a la an enchilada (sorta) that looks to have pepper sauce in it, like some sort of gravy with pepper sauce. Now my hubby is Trini and we've had more rotis (and doubles and aloo pies etc etc) in Toronto and in Trinidad per se and we've never seen roti served this way but let it go. Sides looked... okay, but the rice was mushy and the cole slaw almost pure mayonnaise. Partner's salad sounded like a good idea but the melon did NOT work, it was just odd. 

As to the roti itself: Roti is a dahlpuri that's wrapped around a filling of curried veg (potatoes and chickepeas, or aloo and channa as they say in TT) and either meat (usually chicken or goat) or more veggies like eggplant, spinach or pumpkin squash. This one had zero chickpeas, UNpeeled potato which is very wrong, some decent beef and... not even a speck of curry. We're talking tinned madras curry that they use in Trinidad- not complex and you can literally buy it off the shelf here. The sauce was sort of Chinese-ish? We got a little ramekin of the chicken to see if it was just the beef that was wrong. Nope- not a drop of curry, just the same cloying sort of Chinese flavour.

This is the insane thing: The roti shell, the dahlpuri, was fantastic. and owner said it was made by a lady from Guyana. They can be bought individually and we might try that as the alternative is Roti Hut far away from us in the NE. But what's insane is that YOU HAVE A GUYANESE COOK making your dahlpuri, why in the hell have you not had her show you how to make the filling??

Mexican side of menu looked good. Do not go here for roti. $38 incl tip for a resoundingly disappointing lunch."}
{"text":"Went to the Asiatown location today since I live and work right around the corner. The grilled provolone sandwich lunch special is up there in contention for my favorite sandwich ever. Its fantastic."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot! Chicken sesame salad was a good size and very filling. Staff was extremely friendly and place was cute. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Chicken tasted like sand and the peppers were so soggy in my Greek salad! Not going back"}
{"text":"Stopped in on our way to a show and had chicken and fish tacos. Excellent flavour- unusual combination of ingredients that really works. Margaritas were excellent, too!  Will definitely be back when we're in the area."}
{"text":"Good little sandwich place in Tremont, but we were not overwhelmed. The bread was delicious, but the sandwiches were overpriced. I had a Greek sub with no turkey on it and requested additional veggies instead, and I got a paltry piece of lettuce and like seven sprouts. I paid the same as what someone would pay with turkey which would have been fine if I had gotten more of the green stuff. There was a cooler that had lots of bottled beverages and I had some really stellar tea. Probably won't be in a hurry to go back."}
{"text":"We were garage/yard sale shopping around Tremont and decided to stop in at La Bodega. The girlfriend and I were not disappointed at all. I got the #53 and she got the #43. Both were very good! They we're out of sub bread which I was bummed about but the regular sourdough bread was just as good if not possibly better. After all the walking we did, it was nice to sit in the A/C and enjoy a delicious lunch. Worth a try for sure!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwiches.  DON'T BE MISLEAD BY THE NAME!  A New Yorker visiting Cleveland, I know a bodega as an ethnic deli, and depending on where you are, dodgy.  This is the furthest thing from it!

I found this gem on Yelp.  I had the #23 roastbeef, cream cheese, caramelized onions and peppers on bread that blew my mind.   Also grabbed the macaroni and cheese cold salad that had blocks of cheese and a sour cream base.  You don't want to miss either of these creations!

The place is quaint set on a corner with outdoor seating, and indoor seating is clean and surrounded with great art pieces.  Good selection of drinks and menu had so many amazing selections available.  The folks working were very friendly and the whole vibe was very cool.  Don't miss out."}
{"text":"This place got some interesting menu. Very European, location is nice. Also like the design inside"}
{"text":"We stopped by for a quick lunch, more or less sight unseen. We had three great sandwiches, and got to sit outside among friendly folks. I had the Southwest Sandwich, my friends had the Tuna Salad sandwiches, and all three were terrific."}
{"text":"This place was delightful!! It wasn't busy when we arrived tonight, and we had great service. The food was authentic and very flavorful. I enjoyed beef roti with the salad and coleslaw for sides and it was the perfect amount of spice! So good! The salad was amazing and balanced out the dish. We were treated with a new dessert the chef was trying - the corn cake. I am hopeful he will keep it! Not too sweet, great texture, and perfect for finishing up the meal. All in all I highly recommend them and will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Very small sand which shop that offers both outdoor picnic and some seats o the inside. The menu is large, with a variety of salad or sandwich options, the combinations are endless.

The food is made right where you ordered and refreshments are inside the cooler as well. Very busy with locals stopping in. The portions are very big, so you won't wave hungry!

The food itself was what you would typically expect, nothing over the top, but did look fresh and was enjoyable."}
{"text":"I go to La Bodega for salads, usually the #7 Chinese chicken salad as it's my favorite on the menu. I have never been disappointed. Greens are always fresh, salads are always well made. The price is totally reasonable for the size and quality of the salads. ($10 or so.) I wouldn't recommend the salmon (really, lox) salad, however, unless you are a huge fan of lox. I love the little shop's atmosphere. Low-key & charming. I usually get my food to go, but it's a comfy place to eat in, too."}
{"text":"It would be nice if the restaurant was licensed so you could enjoy a drink with your meal, but that wasn't the issue we had with this establishment. 

I will never visit this place again and would highly recommend going elsewhere. 

The service was awful. I won't go into details, but  beware when splitting bills and make sure to ask for receipts."}
{"text":"I don't see how this place has such rave reviews. Went the other day -- I got some pita with hummus & veggies. Boyfriend got some turkey sandwich. He commented that the turkey was poor quality -- mine tasted like stale crusty pita overloaded with tasteless muddy hummus. We ate there and both had a stomach ache before even finishing our sandwiches. We tossed over half of our order. Needless to say, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Great food!  It's a mix of Mexican and Caribbean dishes.  The food was well prepared and came out in pretty good time.  I had the macaroni & chicken dish and quite enjoyed the perfect amount of spice.

We had chips and the guacamole was fresh and on point.  They treated us to a new dessert they were testing out.  It reminded me of a sweet cornbread.  I really hope they put it on the menu because it was very good.

We'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Tremont is a little lacking in lunch options, but La Bodega is a great little sandwich shop in Tremont that also has soup and a few salad items.  I always get the #40 - tomato, boccicini, basil, and pesto mayo on rosemary ciabatta.  Delicious!  

Everything comes with chips, and service is fast.  There is a small eat-in area and tables outside when it's nice out but I get the sense that most of their business is in takeout.  

Great spot for a quick, fresh, and delicious sandwich to go!"}
{"text":"Hell Yea Hangover Sub.

With SO many options, I ordered the #45: Southwestern Sub.  

It was great, and huge, and smashed in a panini maker or something of the sort.  I would have preferred my turkey warmer and my cheese melted, but it was still amazing.  

My sub included turkey, thick large crumbles of bacon, jalapeno peppers, colored peppers, tomato, onion, spices, hot sauce, awesome cajun mayo, and Jack cheese.  The delicious cajun mayo dripped out of my sub and onto my face and was very sexy.  

Subs are served with Baked, BBQ or Regular Lays.  

Quaint environment to enjoy my late lunch.  The paint colors and random artwork were peaceful."}
{"text":"Great jerk tacos and big portions! The mango salsa was ripe and sweet, fabulous with the creamy coleslaw and a little added hot sauce. The jerk chicken tasted great but a little extra jerk sauce and citrus would've been nice. Maybe a little less rice as well.

Well priced and good service. All my friends liked their food as well... we all had jerk chicken  items.

Recommended if you're looking for a well priced casual tasty dinner.

I should note that they do not serve alcohol. Also, if atmosphere is what you're going for then this might not be the place for you... not exactly a romantic or trendy environment."}
{"text":"La Bodega is my favorite lunch spot in Tremont. Well, Tremont barely has any lunch options, so I'll even go as far as to say my favorite in Cleveland.

The sandwiches are always huge and they have tons of choices.  I always get the #48 on Asiago - basically a grilled cheese, on cheese bread, with bacon. I mean, how could one ever go wrong with this?!

The mac & cheese salad is also realy great - it's a creamy, cheesy (is there a pattern here?) version of macaroni salad.   

The service is always speedy and even though it's small, we've never had trouble finding a seat if we wanted to eat in."}
{"text":"The food here is good. A little bit on the pricey side for a sandwich/sub. The options around Tremont are slim for a quick bite to grab on the go. The sandwiches are heated on a panini grill. This is where I go if I have a hangover that allows me to eat. After it is all said and done, you may be spending around $10 for a combo meal."}
{"text":"Great lunch time spot. I work right down the street from the Midtown location so I was delighted to find out about them. They have very friendly staff that always great you with a smile. The menu is extensive, lots of choice to look through so of you are looking to come for the first time be prepared tonbe on sandwich overload! My two favorite sandwiches are the turkey sandwich with cranberry mayo and the smoked salmon on the bagel. Have never tried any of the side that they offer but they look good. Bon Appétit!"}
{"text":"Great food for a first try.  The staff were very helpful and friendly. They are working out a few bumps like my hot water and lemon had to be served in a glass as they are needing cups.   That didn't stop the food from being very tasty and affordable.

I had the jerked fish tacos.. so tasty! I found it flavourful without being over powering.   My friend had the burger with sweet potato fries.   He enjoyed it thought the flat bread used as a bun would have been better toasted.  Minor points as the flavor was great!

Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Great little unassuming lunch spot. I met a friend of mine there for lunch the other day and I was pleasantly surprised. Admittedly, I drove right by the place. I ordered the Southwestern Sub which was delicious! Spicy, but not overwhelming. It heats up nicely in the toaster oven for leftovers and I had the second half of it today for lunch. They have a nice selection of drinks in a cooler and provide bottle recycling. I also appreciate that the sub was wrapped in a foil sheet and paper, no plastic! The price was fair and the food was quite tasty. We sat at a nice table out front and did some people watching which made for an enjoyable afternoon."}
{"text":"I've been to the new one on Superior twice. The sandwiches are huge - enough to share or for two meals - and both that I had there were really good. The salad was also good  and large enough to share.

In the last trip I had the tortilla soup - tasty, but thin and not many vegetables or chicken in it.

The building itself is very cute, with big windows and art work.

My only problem with this place is everything is served on throwaway materials - paper, foil, styrofoam - even if you are eating in. I will definitely go back, but I hope that changes."}
{"text":"Delicious Caribbean food. The beef roti was great, and so were the fish tacos! Highly recommend it for something different in Calgary"}
{"text":"This is a place that I've been wanting to check off my list to try for a while. When I first arrived, I got the distinct impression that they expected me to know what my order was already. The menu is huge! When I asked for a recommendation, she energetically made some. 

I ended up with the Greek sub and my lunch partner ordered the California sub. Holy HUGE! They were panini grilled, came with chips, and totally delicious! I do wish the chips were something more exciting than Lays. Seems like a waste of calories just to eat  Lays potato chips. ;) Overall, this was a total win. 

The building is a little obscure. Not quite in the heart of Tremont, but in a cozy corner spot off Starkweather. The dining space is small, so I could see a lunchtime rush limiting your options. They also used shelving in the dining space for extra storage, which diminished some of the charm, but hey - storage space is limited in old buildings. If anyone understands that, it's this girl. 

I would definitely come back here! Great lunch spot."}
{"text":"You want the sandwich, you can't handle the sandwich. Great sandwich place in Tremont, my favorite 'hood. Watch the attractive people walk by with their dog while you eat. They may just come in so you can strike up a conversation and get a date out of it too.  I usually get the number 22. Roast beef on sourdough with havarti cheese (never really can find good havarti anywhere). Service is always good and quick. I'll pay a little more for a sandwich for that old fashioned good service. I can only get there once in a while but they treat me like a regular. This ain't no franchise subway son. You won't get these epic mealtime sandwiches anywhere. They should have some man vs. food size challenge to add to the legend of this one if kind place."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican flavours and delightful presentation. This is the best Mexican food we've had since moving from Los Angeles, where Mexican food is plentiful. We highly recommend the crispy tacos, which seem to be made with homemade tortilla shells. Their burritos were perfect too. They definitely earned their five stars."}
{"text":"I thought it was okay. I know it is so overused when you say a restaurant's staff is friendly but sometimes it's rare when you actually get a genuine smile and a little friendly small talk. The staff really seems friendly and nice, well the two that I'd encountered. It was about less of an hour of closing time and no one was there so I decided to get my sandwich to go. As I waited, I just wandered off to the back...the actual dining area, to be nosey. The set up is small (to me) and...don't know how to describe it...off or something. 

But anyway, I got my sandwich and headed home. My thoughts when I first pulled it out the bag was \"wow, this is heavy\" and when I opened it, \"dang, this is a big sandwich\" lol. Now you can choose the bread you want for the sandwich and I decided on the asiago cheese bread.  To me it didn't really taste like it...more like just regular French bread or something, not asiago cheese.  Didn't really manage to finish it because it was honestly too much...one half is just enough (side note: maybe they should sell half sandwiches).


At the end, it was an okay sandwich, not eager for another visit but worth trying out again...much much later."}
{"text":"Great salad and sandwiches. Roast beef sandwiches are way above average...especially the blue cheese. Delivery catering was prompt, ordering was easy."}
