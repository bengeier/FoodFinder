{"text":"The food is generally good, but I was disappointed with my gyro being served with fries inside it. A cheap filler if you ask me. The gyro itself is overpriced,  I've had better at Greek food festivals."}
{"text":"Our initial impression walking in the door was good,  but things got worse from there,  hummus sampler, 3 kinds ,  should never be ordered, it contains a strange potato hummus that we swear had turned sour, but was told by the chef that its supposed to be like that.  the dolmades were hard , small slightly burned on the botttom and crumbly and dry inside, never order these!  the sausage pizza was a huge dissappointment, just about the worst tasting , worst crust pizza we have ever tasted, i say tasted because we didnt eat it , the dogs did. that item should not be on the menu! what makes it worse is that when you walkin you see a wood fired oven, well the pizza doesnt come out of that oven, i thinkits just for show!!!   other food we ordered was bland and not worth the calories.   look to the frozen food section in giant eagle for good greek food in the burg...    as for the other reviews of this rest. ,  we depended on them to try this place,  please dont sugarcoat this average food."}
{"text":"I enjoy visiting Mediterrano because the food is always made with fresh ingredients, some of which will change on a seasonal basis, with most things being made \"from scratch\" by the hands of Chef Ben. I am a cook myself and when I sit down at a restaurant and can immediately tell that whoever created the food on my plate really cared about how it tastes, I feel like I'm \"home.\"   This, folks, is not anonymous food!  Once, last autumn, I ordered an item from the Glyka (dessert) section of the menu and after a minute or two, was informed that there would be a substitution of the warm apple preserve with a honey walnut fig preserve, would that be okay? I asked about where they got their fig preserve and was told that they bought the figs fresh in the Strip District, so the preserves that day were house-made. I was hooked (and I love figs.) Upon receiving my dessert, I lifted my fork with high hopes and guess what? Fabulous! You can taste real, trust me.  But as for the food on the main menu? Creative, interesting-- all the traditional dishes based on Helena's mom's recipes (yes, from the Greek family recipe collections)-- fresh, often locally sourced, with such intense energy imbued by a chef who cares, and nicely sized portions. What are you waiting for? Try this restaurant out, please do yourself a favor."}
{"text":"Excellent lamb - moist and well prepared!  Combination of Greek cheese, tomatoes and orzo that accompanied the lamb blended superbly.  Moussaka was well done, reflected experience and quality ingredients. Green beans were bright and tender."}
{"text":"Great service, the waitress was very friendly and checked us at property time. The food was good, specially Spanokopita, the crispy pita had really thing texture. The food reminded me of authentic Chinese food :)"}
{"text":"On a recent visit to Mediterrano, I was a bit surprised. Having been there several times before, I  expected things to be the same. That , however, was not the case. The sign out front said \"new menu.\" My friend got the Moussaka, she said it was good, not great. Gone is the complimentary trio of dip and warm pita of yesterday. I ordered the lamb shank over orzo. The lamb tasted like it had been frozen and was old. The orzo was mushy. We had to ask for pita bread to accompany our meal. I don't think I'll be going back any time soon!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try something a little different and found that Mediterrano had a fairly good rating. My experience did not match those of other reviewers.    The atmosphere of the restaurant was lively, the server was upbeat and personable, but the food was bland, overpriced, and unappealing. My date asked that they withhold sun-dried tomatoes from her dish, it arrived with them in abundance. The appetizer we ordered when we first sat down arrived after the bill.  Most disappointing, was the night's special, lamb chops.  For $40, I was served two TINY chops, half a dozen small new potatoes and 5 stalks of asparagus.  None of the items were well prepared and none of them had any seasoning worth mentioning. It was definitely not worth the price.  I was very disappointed. I will not go back. I recommend you don't even try."}
{"text":"Greek food, yes. Good Greek Food? No. Really good Greek food? Certainly not.   It's really too bad too, because I was hoping that this new place would be good. Tried it tonight, and sadly it is not.   Food: Expensive in some cases, and not good. (I have a suspicion that these people were caterers that decided to open a restaurant, not that, that is always bad, bit sometimes pretty noticeable.) Highlight of the whole experience, their French fries are good. Of all the things the two of us ate at the restaurant, that was the best we could come up with.  Service: Not good, we had to beg the waitress two different times for drink refills. Also, I'm not sure you get one specific waitress, there were three waitresses working the floor, and the one that took our order, we pretty much never saw again. It was a little confusing, as we were looking to beg someone for more drinks, and didn't know who to beg. Also for only having 11 or 12 tables, which were not all full, the service was slow.  Lastly, just as a casual observation by someone who likes to be comfortable while dining out, having dining chairs with arms in a restaurant can make things very uncomfortable for people who are overweight.   As I was in this establishment tonight, a couple came in and they were  overweight, they really had to stuff themselves into these restrictive chairs, and it was clear that they would be more comfortable if not so restricted. They were not so overweight that you would think this would be a concern they would normally have. Anyway, the chairs are stupid, and uncomfortable anyway.   To sum up: Pass on this restaurant. Go someplace good instead."}
{"text":"me and the old lady came here twice for the gyros and I really like them and so does she I have no complaints about the food but it's pricy we came all the way from new Castle for gyros because there is no good gyros near home so we come here"}
{"text":"Wonderful as always! Have been long-time customers but has been much better since their mini-reopening last year. AMAZING dolmades and table side saganaki have started off our past three visits. Just tried the Lamb Shank Giouvetsi for the first time last night and it may have been the best dish I've had in years (anywhere!)... honey-crusted with a cinnamon tomato sauce. YUM. Finish your meal with a \"Baklava Brownie\"... Chef promised us they're Calorie-Free!"}
{"text":"As one reviewer stated, they have gone downhill over the years, and sliding still. The menu is heavily focused on pita. The Spinakopita is very dry, and might be something prepackaged not house made. The moussaka tends to be runny. For a restaurant that claims to be Greek, what are provolone and mozzarella doing in the entrees? Long time BYOB, which is uncivilized! Perhaps they have forgotten Greece has some good wines."}
{"text":"We were driving down Babcock on our way to a concert and wanted to grab dinner first. We had first pulled into another restaurant and found their wait was going to be 40 minutes and we didn't feel we could afford the time and opted to try something else. We were prepared for fast food and heading that direction when we passed this little restaurant and saw the seating inside and took a gamble. The menu is posted on the wall outside the door sans prices and I had a moment of doubt. I was looking for good food... but not $$$ food.   The restaurant inside was beautifully decorated. It was quiet with subdued light. I thought it was possible that it was a new restaurant since it was 6:30 and there were many open tables available. We weren't seated right away and told it would be about five minutes. At first I thought it was odd but then the hostess whispered that she would go ahead and seat us if we didn't mind the 'less secluded' seating.   The waitress arrived a bit later to our table and took our orders. I had heard of Moussaka in the past and saw it on the menu and wanted to try it, my husband chose a small pizza with white sauce and lamb and feta. While we waited for our dinners to arrive the waitress brought a taste of hummus and pizza bread tips. I am sure this was a patience builder for us since we had been waiting a bit during each element of the experience. It was delicious. Of course, I am biased since I have never met a hummus I didn't like.   Dinner arrived hot and in generous portions. The square of Moussaka was large and I had the spinach and rice pilaf as sides. I found the rice pilaf to be the best item on my plate. I had a hard time not losing my manners while eating it. I also really enjoyed the spinach which was well prepared. I was not a huge fan of the Moussaka but I have decided that since both my sides  were delicious and the taste I had of the pizza my husband ordered that it must be that I don't care for the dish, not that it wasn't good.   When the waitress checked on us again we mentioned we had an engagement to get to and she quickly provided our check and a few to go boxes. Dinner for two plus tip was $40. (Minus drinks since we are not the type to have drinks during our meals)   All in all we are glad we stopped in and we both agreed that we would try them again in the future and explore the menu further."}
{"text":"Started out with Greek salads which were fine.  The lemon chicken was over spiced and parts of it were raw.   The PASTITSIO was dry.  I didn't see any white sauce.  The green beans were very salty.  After finishing our salads and after the entrees were brought to the table, the waiter didn't take our salad plates away.  I wasn't asked if I wanted more coffee.  We were the only ones in the place so it was not like he was too busy.  I was not impressed with the food."}
{"text":"This was my first Greek restaurant and will not be my last. The service was fantastic and with a mediterranean waitress, it made an even more realistic experience. The inside is very nice and Greek oriented. I ordered the lemon chicken and is was grilled to perfection. I was excited that they gave us a basket of pita on the house. The prices were a bit high, but overall it was a very great experience and a restaurant that I will return to."}
{"text":"Yum!!! We started our meal with the dolmades- they're fresh, homemade and much larger than most. Delicious! We ordered lots of food and shared our feast. Each meal was unique. We had the rack of lamb- very, very tender. We also had the pork and chicken souvlakia. Fun to share! The lemon potatoes were unique! We also had the lemon soup - very strong lemon flavor which I loved! My kids loved their pastitsio and mousaka - generous portions! Pastries- just get a lot! Because they'll go quickly!!!! We had so much fun sampling everything! This restaurant has a beautiful interior AND it was also perfect for a different take out experience.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I think this place is great!  I've been there I think 4 or 5 times in the last few years.  It's a hidden gem.  Well, it's actually not hidden at all but it seems as if no one knows about it when I tell them.  I grew up eating this kind of food - this stuff is good!"}
{"text":"New to the area and looking for a new favorite greek place. Referred here by some co workers so decided to try it. Overall I think it is mediocre at best.  Nothing was horrible but nothing was amazing either. My husband had lamb and  had chicken neither had much flavor.  The salad had so much vinegar on it we couldn't eat it because it we would gag on the amount of vinegar. The humus sampler had three flavors spicy tomato but tasted like plain humus, spinach and butter humus that tasted like butter, and the olive and garlic humus that tastes like only olive. Again not all bad but not worth the price either.  If you go skip the balaclava it was gross and dry."}
{"text":"The panini sandwiches, on a pita, are an excellent lunch. Serving size is large and comes with a mound of feta covered fries. The restaurant itself is clean and inviting and the staff is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Such a great find out in the North Hills!  Are the franchise, chains of McKnight Road making your stomach churn??  This is the spot to check out.  The atmosphere is great, it is byob, the food is fresh, and the servers are really nice :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food.  The waitress was exceptional - so nice and helpful.  Needs better atmosphere and decor - lower lighting, etc.  Could use the space in a better way.  Needs more elegance for the prices.  But still, I will go back."}
{"text":"I gave 2 stars the last time and this time was no better. We went for dinner this time.  I waited so long because of the first visit.   It is not like they are trying to get better, it is like they know it is the only Greek place around and people will come.  Once again one waitress at dinner no less, she shouldn't have had to be put through that. She was doing her best but the restaurant was full.  The Dolmades were worse this time they were as small as a little child's finger and were extra tough and dry, it was 98% leaf.  The fried zucchini again was paper thin but the batter does have a good taste, for $8 they really could give you a thicker zucchini.  My son wanted pizza they were out, I wanted Mousaka they were out, I got Pastitsio it was 95% cream topping and 3% noodles and 2% meat.  I am really giving it a big number on the noodles and meat too, now for $16 there is no excuse for this.  I make this and it isn't like it is  extremely expensive to make, so they really are ripping people off on this especially considering the size you get.  The Lamb Souvlaki was small and dry, you wouldn't mind the high cost if the food you get was worth it.  They only give you 3/4 of a glass of beverage and since there is only one waitress you wait and wait for a refill if your lucky.  Our waitress was the only good part, she was nice and apologetic for the wait and them being out of food.  We got in at 6 and were there for 2 hours, we didn't want to be and if there were more than one waitress we wouldn't have had to be.  The hostess only started helping the waitress when we were leaving, she really could have helped out more.  You should never run out of food on the menu by 6 pm.  That is a problem, it isn't an extremely large menu.  Also for the people giving this place 5 stars they either have no idea what Greek food is supposed to taste like or bad judges of restaurants.  Maybe they know someone there and want to help by giving 5 stars.  Not worth the price when you consider the quality and amount of food you get, but if  you have money you like to waste have at it."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere plus it is byob.  The owners are very nice and personable.   Though it disappoints me that so many people order gyros for dinner.  Folks, get a REAL greek entree for dinner and save gyros for the lunchtime crowd."}
{"text":"Had our rehearsal dinner for our wedding here. The food was amazing and we were allowed to do a tasting beforehand. Helena was our contact person and she was so helpful. the space was perfect for our group. Their dolmades are my favorite thing on the menu but they also do this rolled fried zucchini app with cumin stewed tomatos that i can't get enough of. Basically, great atmosphere especially for something cozy like a date but open enough for a family meal."}
{"text":"grape leaves were the tiniest we've ever eaten!  About the size of a cocktail frank, and about as remarkable.  The lemon piece served with them was dried out. The hummus, though tasty, was VERY thick!  Almost like cutting into a soft cheese - not spreadable.  We asked for some oil to add to it and felt that that was really a just so-so solution.  I doubt seriously that it was freshly made - thinking it had been sitting around for a while.   Our pastitsio was ok - not very hot when served though, my guess is that it was microwaved.  Our pasta (ziti)  was the worst we've had in a restaurant ever - in that it was SO overdone.  Normally, if a dish isn't perfect , we will not ask for a replacement, but this was luke warm and SO mushy and starchy and tasteless. The server explained something that I really didn't want to know - that the pasta is precooked at the beginning of the day and then reheated ! - not cooked to order.  Our server was accomodating, but the whole experience was much less than wonderful.  While we expect ethnic music in an ethnic restaurant, theirs was so loud that after a couple times around the play list we were really quite ready to leave and had our 2nd plate of ziti (only slightly less mushy) packaged to go.  a big disappointment - glad we had a groupon.  BUT - it turns out that our server's insistance that the groupon required us to order two entrees (rather than the mix of soup/salad and one entree we'd planned to order) was NOT true. We didn't have the groupon with us - only on my phone and I didn't look closely at it until I got home and looked at it more closely on my lap  top. SO that less than hot, overdone ziti was the dish that we actually didn't plan to order - but we had to, and that pushed our lunch order over the $30 limit of the groupon -- just an overall bad lunch experience - after a previous lunch there which was much better."}
{"text":"Beautiful presentation.  We fought over the pita bread.  We started out with fried eggplant & zucchini, pita with 2 types of dip, stuffed grape leaves, and spinach pies.  Huge portions ... took 1/2 home.  Our entrees were stuffed peppers with roasted potatoes and a seafood pasta (shrimp, scallop, and held the mussels) in a white cheesy creamy sauce.  Yes I slopped up the remaining sauce with my pita bread.  We took home nice size portions of baclava.    We arrived at 7:00 and ended up being the last table of the evening.  The staff didn't rush us out the door.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Food was good. VERY small entrees    The appetizers were very good fried calamari light. The dips excellent, spinach triangles good too. Friendly service but only one gentleman BYOB"}
{"text":"Delicious Greek food. The lemon soup is to die for. Pastitsio was wonderful. Bread pudding was superb!!"}
{"text":"This parking lot needs some work. Maybe that was more apparent on a rainy day because half of the spots were puddles.  They're a little pricey for a gyro with fries ($12) and it's not anything special. It's not bad, but it's not great. The fries had NO SALT on them and no salt on any tables. Our server was pretty busy making friends so just got by without it and left the rest for them to eat.  Mom got lemon rice soup after reading another review. It was okay, but kind of bitter. She liked spinach side for $3.   It's a cute place and I'll probably never be in Pittsburgh again to have to worry about going back."}
{"text":"I do believe this place is closed and has been permanently closed for at least 2 months now.   The food was decent and the service was pretty good but it was overpriced to me. Also they had weird hours and I feel like they were closed half the times that I tried to go there mainly due to renovation, which I found odd because they weren't open long enough to need renovation. Typically a restaurant or bar can go 7 years before needing drastic change i.e. renovation, new menu, new business name, and if I remember correctly they were a very young business. Nice people. Ultimately, not happy to see them close."}
{"text":"I recently was here for a birthday and was pleasantly surprised for such a nice place along Babcock Blvd. The service was pretty good, although a little slow, but overall I had no issue.  The restaurant itself is smaller and more intimate and the best part is that it's BYOB. Because of it's size, many of the tables (including ours) are located near the door, which offered us a nice breeze of the cold, breezy weather each time the door opened.  The food: I ordered the hummus as an appetizer and while it was good (it's hard to mess up hummus), I was not blown away. It tasted like hummus from a grocery store that added a little olive oil on the bottom of the dish and garnished. Choosing dinner was a tough decision because the special sounded great (stuffed chicken), but I worried that it would be something the chef wanted to get rid of, so I ordered the lamb burger. I was pretty happy with the burger, as the lamb tasted great and flavorful and the feta cheese was fresh. The fries were good, but incredibly salty. Going back to the \"special\" comment ... my friend ordered it and it was exactly what I was afraid of. It was clearly ingredients that the chef wanted to get rid of. The chicken looked overcooked and was completely blanketed in a sauce that hid the dish. The portion size was small as well as the sides - mashed potatoes and vegetables. The overall meal presentation was terrible and clearly lacked any cohesion. They did not enjoy it as nearly as much as they hoped to, yet paid the full $20 (my burger? $9).  Here is where my review takes a somewhat downward turn and really makes me take the star away. I got the walnut cake as dessert after the server came back to tell me there was one piece left. This was an amateur mistake on my part as the cake was incredibly dry (although maybe the cake always is) and I couldn't stomach eating the rest.  Overall, I was pleased. Not sure I'll make a point to go back and I definitely wasn't blown away, but I didn't leave totally unhappy. If you're in the area and really want to try something outside of a chain restuarant, Mediterrano might be a good stop."}
{"text":"I ordered the Arni Souvlaki and had to send it back. The lamb pieces were tough and dry, so overcooked, they were barely edible. The second order was cooked perfect, it was as if the first order was an attempt to send out leftovers from lunch since the restaurant was closed for a private affair when we arrived. The lamb burger had chunks of cartilage and bone. Very disappointed how poor the food has become. I have no idea if it's a different owner or head Chef but I'm sure it's one or the other. You can't charge $18-$35 a plate without a good staff and expect to survive."}
{"text":"Such a friendly atmosphere and such amazing food! I had the best vegan Mediterranean dinner here. The menu has a few vegetarian options and a few items can be adjusted to be vegan friendly as well! The pita and hummus is flawless."}
{"text":"Decided to take out some hummus.... Restaurant was not busy and my Order took way too long. I also asked for a taste of their avgholemono soup. It's almost in edible. It tasted like lemon. Period. Not only that they clearly use lemon concentrate not fresh lemons and the orzo was overcooked. Way better at Greek Stop only 15 min from here"}
{"text":"The place is really nice.  Let's start with the atmosphere and people there; great! Small and cozy and the service was fast and efficient.  We tried many things from appetizers, salads and entrees and everything tasted nice.  Some things might not had been cooked as the original Greek way (I am a native Greek) but they still tasted delicious.  About the price it was normal for a Greek restaurant (not diner :) ) in the US; slightly pricy but this is what it is :) I would def go back."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place since it opened because I enjoy Greek food.  I was happy to finally try it with a friend courtesy of Groupon.  The menu has some great choices.  But it's definitely on the more expensive side. My friend ordered the Greek Pasta and really enjoyed it. I had the Lemon Chicken with Greek Fries. The fries were terrific. The chicken was tasty, but given than it was a half chicken I thought it was a little on the petite side.  I ordered a piece of espresso cake to go.  It was good but when I went to eat it later that night it seemed to be missing most of the bottom layer which was disappointing after I had to wait ten minutes for it to be boxed up.  I've since returned with the same friend (this time with a Pittsburgh Dining Card).  We decided to get the Greek fries as an appetizer since we both liked them so much last time along with the spanikopita.  For our entrees, my friend got the tapenade pizza and I selected the lamb kabobs.  I'm not usually a fan of olives, but that pizza was quite tasty.  My lamb kabobs were exactly what I wanted, sitting gently on rice pilaf.  For dessert we both decided on the warm comfort of the milopita.    All in all I dig it.  The prices are a little on the high side so having a Groupon or a similar discount helps.  Combine that with good food and good service, I'm sure to return again with my Mediterranean food loving friend once our pockets can handle it."}
{"text":"I have been here maybe 3-4 times.  It is a small restaurant with a really great atmosphere.  I have tried several different dishes, during my visits.  I love the beet salad the best. The spanikopita is tasty, but it was too greasy/soggy for my liking and I most likely will not get it again.    The mushroom gyro was just OK, and it could stand to lose the fries since you get half a plate of them with the gyro.  It's just overkill and completely unnecessary to have fries on the gyro.  That said, the fries ARE great, but I'd rather have more mushrooms in my gyro than fry filler.  In the past I have also tried the vegetarian moussaka and loved it. I also thought the mushroom flatbread was delicious.   One other thing about Mediterrano is that it is BYOB, which is a wonderful bonus."}
{"text":"Only had a salad which was good, but it took almost 25 minutes for it to be delivered to the table after we had ordered. Not sure salads take that long to make especially with rough chopped veggies.  Interested in going back and having a full meal."}
{"text":"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...I'll explain:  I went to Mediterrano when it first opened a few years ago, and the experience was mind-blowing!  In the vast ethnic food-desert that is Pittsburgh, Mediterrano offered REALLY good authentic Greek cuisine, New York good.  I told all my friends about it, it was amazing.  I remember paying about $40 for my wife and me, and thinking that I would have paid double.  Fast forward a few years:  I went back, and had the most mediocre Greek food...really it was terrible.  We were told that the normal chef was sick, and that someone was filling in.  Reluctantly, we paid the bill (prices had gone up), and said we would go back when the normal chef returned.  Next time, we ordered in.  We spent $100, and got what looked like $40 worth of food...and it wasn't great.  The food was generally lacking substance and flavor.  Most upsettingly, it was a really bad value.  A Groupon came up, so we decided to give it another shot.  We ordered Gyros, just Gyros:  they were very good.  They're not the best I've ever had, but definitely solid.  I thought perhaps they had figured out whatever was wrong.  Tonight, we went again...and this will likely be the last time.  The waitress insisted that we had to order 4 entrees to fulfill the Groupon (which it didn't specify), and wouldn't let us use a gift certificate in addition to the Groupon (which is against policy I think).  Our bill was $80 before tip.  We ordered: Spanikopita ($7):  We received 2 soggy little triangles of spanikopita.  Still, this was the highlight of the meal...it was all downhill from here.  Lamb Gyro and Eggplant Gyro platters ($12 ea):  Greek salad was inedibly sour.  The french fries were somehow both burned, and cold.  The Gyros themselves were fine, not spectacular.  Lamb pasta (dinner special, $24):  The portion was small and it wasn't very good.  The lamb tasted fine, but there wasn't much of it.  The past and sauce I could have made better at home.  I can't post pictures, but do the posted pictures look like $25 dishes to you?!  Brisket Pizza:  I've had this one before, it wasn't bad.  Tonight, it was burnt and falling apart!  They must have messed up the crust, as the pizza couldn't be picked up without falling apart (I've never had this experience with pizza).   It's so sad.  This was an AMAZING restaurant, now below average quality and very expensive.  I think that as video killed the radio star; Groupon killed the great authentic ethnic restaurant."}
{"text":"I love Greek food, but I am not sure how crazy I am about this one.  I've been to all these Greek festivales that burns holes in my bank acount because of its delicious-ness.    I LOVE avgolemeno soup, BUT this was probably the least satisfying one I have had.  The rice was hard and undercooked, the broth was a greyish color, which was strange.  Anywhoo, my biggest problem was the undercooked rice.  Good thing I'm not a bird.  I am also kookoo for Pastitsio, but theirs was really dry, with little bechamel sauce, which was a disappointing.  The Moussaka was good though, that one one was a solid platter.    Their dinners are very generous in portions - you get to choose TWO sides!  The lemon potatoes - YUM!.    I also like their spanikopita - they gave me a lemon wedge which gave it a nice spritz that I never thought to put on.  It was very delicious!"}
{"text":"I am writing this as I sit in the restaurant and am very disappointed .  I have been coming here for years and it was always good until tonight.  Apparently they have a new \"chef\" who works on Sundays and he can't even make a edible dish.  First our salad had a 1/2 inch of dressing on the bottom of the plate then both of our entrees were inedible.   This is a Greek place and the new \"chef\" can't even make a gyro properly.  Then my brisket came out looking like charcoal!   I have eaten sand that had more moisture.   So I will come back but not on a Sunday!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  I had lunch there last week and the food was delicious and resonably priced.  The restaurant is small but cozy.  The atmosphere is cheerful and I love how it is decorated.  I highly reccomend this place!!"}
{"text":"Okay, this is my second visit to Mediterrano, the first being maybe a week or two after they opened, and BY (before Yelp).   So fast forward to present. . . months later. My wife and I are seated in the empty restaurant (we got there slightly before noon).   Let me hit the high points first. . . the gyro pitas? Great. The lamb was tender, seasoned nicely, REALLY hit the spot. Comfort food Greek style. Served with a huge plate of fries seasoned in salt with crumbled feta on them. It's nicely appointed. . . a surprise coming off the seeming depression era end of Babcock replete with its laundromats, beer distributors and auto repair places.   That was the HARD stuff though. The EASY stuff was. . . well not awesome. Waitress seemed very green. My wife's HM (high-maintenance) order of gyro sans tomato and onion was duplicated on my order, and the waitress seemed pretty content to let it sit on the table, even suggesting perhaps I try it without the onions and tomato to see if maybe I'd ALSO like it that way. She was EXTREMELY friendly. . . just. . . that's not really superb table-waiting protocol. . . you know?   When I asked what the soup of the day was, she said she didn't know then asked (in a very friendly way) if I'd like her to find out. Yes. I DID want her to find out what the soup of the day was. . . how else would I know whether I wanted to order it?   It was cold cucumber and yogurt soup, and to be frank, it was REALLY good. Again, the hard stuff is getting the food to taste really good. They DID that.   When she refilled my sprite it was flat. And I HATE being that guy that sends everything back. Hate it. But the order was wrong and the Sprite was flat. That's EASY stuff. Get the order right and make sure the Sprite's carbonated. . . the food was AWESOME.   I'll come back. I consider this table waiting debacle a fluke. The food was great. I just can't give it more than the three stars I've rated it in good conscience based on the experience."}
{"text":"Worst service on the planet.  When you have to go back to the kitchen not a good sign.  We've seen the parking lot packed, so wanted to give it a shot.  Soda was flat and had to ask multiple times to order!     Food was decent, but not worth dealing with again."}
{"text":"Good food and a great atmosphere. BYOB is a nice touch with a small corking fee. I recommend the Pastitsio."}
{"text":"I've been to Mediterrano 4 times in the last year--1 lunch with my mom and 3 dinners with my husband.  Our most recent experience here, dinner last Friday, reminded me that I've neglected to review this nice establishment.  Overall I'm very much a fan, enough to round up to 5 stars.  The service (especially love Ashley) and quality of food is consistently solid, though we've had some hits and misses with entrees and desserts.  My go-to dishes are the hummus sampler appetizer (great portion and value for $8) and the roasted beet salad (nice white balsamic dressing and so many beets).  A little bit of constructive criticism.  Though I do very much enjoy a meal here, I tend to find myself wishing that the plating/presentation be done with a little more care--it's gotten better though, I think--and that there weren't quite so many knickknacks everywhere gathering dust.  Mediterrano is worth the likely wait if you stop by on a Friday or Saturday evening without dinner reservations.  The current set-up doesn't exactly maximize the minimal space, but I appreciate that the current arrangement involves no tables near the door or restroom.  If you like intimate and charming, give Mediterrano a try."}
{"text":"Awesome! Grape leaves were delish. BYOB."}
{"text":"Yikes, the prices are crazy for what it is and what you get.  If you are going to charge $18-22 for an entrée an all the salads are a la carte, you should have at least linen napkins.  The waitress is the hostess, no salt or pepper on table, and entry is messy.  The food was a tremendous disappointment and with one waitress on a Sunday night, we had to wait for just about everything.  Food was overcooked and just weird.  The fried zucchini and spanokapitos were good, but entrées were tiny and just not tasty.  For six people our bill was $160  plus tip closing in on $200 which included some desserts too.  Everyone felt the same way and although we all live nearby we won't go back.  I can get a better meal at Denny's with better service.  I give them another 6-8 months and they will be closed. My recommendation is to go to Silvioni's or Monte Cello's."}
{"text":"It was alright.  I was on my way home from work and had a hankering for stuffed grape leaves so I picked up some appetizers to go.  I found the grape leaves and my spanakopita a little dry.  Still - I plan to go back and sit down and have a real meal some day.  For me, you can't beat the location."}
{"text":"We live close, and have gotten takeout before, but finally made it in. It's BYOB, so we split a bottle of wine and some hummus - the hummus was great. I got fish/rice pilaf and my husband got a burger... Both of which were good. The service, however, was not so good. Someone dropped off our meals and left, and then we realized we didn't get silverware or a salad, and couldn't find one of the three servers working in this tiny place to ask. We ended up having to go ask the hostess, and then our server didn't come back over for at least 30 mins. When she returned, she didn't apologize for all the mishaps... And was holding a salad, which we had already gotten from the hostess and were finished with our meals by then. Luckily we had a Groupon, which made the bad service a little more bearable. We may get takeout again."}
{"text":"Food is always good, as is the service.  BYOB makes it reasonable, as well."}
{"text":"Service was unbelievably slow. There was one other table in the restaurant and it took over a half hour to get out me food and took the server over ten min to come to the table for drinks. The good is not worth the price either. $40 for a small salmon and chicken skewers that weren't done well enough. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Enjoyable Greek Mediterranean food and BYOB.  Gyros, baklava, feta cheese, Greek style pizza in a brick oven.   The tables are rather close and it did get a little noisy.  Had lamb that was very good.  A nice place to BYOB and relax and have an enjoyable meal!"}
{"text":"Portions use to be insanely large and now have gone to the opposite of being too small. Salads are a la carte now, and about 1/3 their previous size. Food was generally ok, but this is now a 3 star experience.  Previous 4 star view here: A fine place. Nice meditterrean flavors, including whole grilled fish, at fair prices with decent portions. Abundant olive oil, pine nuts, lemon, feta, spinach, aubergine, and oregano will please you if you like Greek food. We love the mousakka and the greek salads. However, this is place is probably not for everybody.  Service is not perfect and it is BYOB, but all-in-all a place worth visiting."}
{"text":"Other than our less than attentive, hard of hearing waitress, we had an okay meal. Don't let the suburban location fool you - the food is pretty decent. My husband's lamb could have been a textbook example for perfectly grilled food. If you want totally serviceable, slightly better than average Mediterranean food, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere!  And great service!  The owner kept checking with us to make sure we were happy with everything he was so nice he asked if we tried there tea and we hadn't yet, so he brought us all some tea no charge.   They have beautiful lanterns hanging from the ceiling and on walls!   We were there on a friday night and they had a belly dancer dancing around the restaurant for entertainment!"}
{"text":"SALT, is the word!  Fries so salty that they could not be eaten.  The fries on on the gyro as well, blaah.  They gyro lacked tzi tzi sauce, it was just meat, fries and some lettuce."}
{"text":"Not the food you picture when you think of Greek food. Touting themselves as an estiatorio, not your typical greek \"stand food,\"  they deliver.  They are BYOB, which my friends and I enjoyed.  It's a fairly small restaurant, but we still easily able to accommodate our group of 8 people.  The ambiance is fun and cozy.  The food was slow to come out, but good things come to those who wait.  I ordered the Pastitsio with french fries, and it was so delicious.  My husband ordered the Gemista with green beans, and it was also very delicious.  Everything was cooked well, and nobody complained at all about any of the dishes they received.  One friend ordered the linguine with meatballs, and it came with one long meatball, which wasn't too difficult to cut up into smaller meatballs. Overall, the food was good, the ambiance was enjoyable, and i would definitely recommend the restaurant and consider going back."}
{"text":"Great food. Very attentive and friendly wait staff (owner?).  The calimari was delicious, very tender and not greasy. I ordered the lamb burger and enjoyed it thoroughly and my husband had the lamb souvlaki and was equally as pleased.  I'm not sure where all the negative comments come from.   It's not cheap, but the quality of the food was excellent!  We will be back."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Thursday evening and it was very good. I had the stuffed tomatoes with a side of the sautéed spinach and it was excellent. My husband has the chicken soulvaki and wasn't blow away by it but said it was fine. It's BYOB ($5 corking fee) and the prices are a little high but still reasonable for the quality and amount of food you get.  The service was friendly and the atmosphere was cozy. The table next to us got a dish that the waitress lights on fire and then squeezes a lemon to extinguish the fire. That was fun to see."}
{"text":"Really awful. I am Greek and I obviously love Greek food. I got a take out order and it was completely inedible. The piece of pastitsio I got was tiny and dried out. Their rice pilaf was tasteless despite being full of too many chopped onions. And the hummus...thick and bland with the consistency of chunky peanut butter. Difficult to explain but it was gross. I will NEVER order or eat there again and I would never recommend anything about this place."}
{"text":"We went last week and was somewhat disappointed.  Heard good things about it, but the entrees were way over-priced and not very large.  I paid $18 for a Mousaka dinner, and it came with one smallish piece of Mousaka and a side of spinach.  No salad, unless I wanted to pay $5 extra.  No bread service either, and my wife ordered a salad.  Needless to say there were no leftovers.  We also ordered Saganaki, which was supposed to be flambeed cheese in rich brandy sauce but it came out dry/overcooked and not a sign of any brandy sauce.  Deserts were reasonable and good; two deserts were only $6 total.  Overall, disappointing, would not rush back."}
{"text":"This chef simply gets it.  Simple food with great favors make this hidden gem worth the drive from anywhere in the North hills.  Sautéed spinach with pine nuts rocks flavors that will turn you into Popeye!    Nod to another review, skip the gyro and try one of the Greek dishes that are so fresh and so good for you!"}
