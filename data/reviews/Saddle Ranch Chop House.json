{"text":"Fun bar, touristy but still sprinkled with typical scottsdale crowd. The only thing I didn't like was my recent experience. I was at table with about six friends and had already ordered drinks when we were asked to get up and let other people waiting sit down. If we hadn't ordered, I wouldn't of minded but there was no apparent sign to wait to be seated. Thought it was strange."}
{"text":"Two of us ordered french toast it looked good but was hard to cut so i turned over the bread and it was burnt on the back side. Sent both orders back. Took so long the other person with us was finished eating when we recieved our order. Being in a hurry  at that time gave a little time to eat. French toast is 4 slices of texas bread dipped in egg. And it's 12.00 a serving  that's high for 4 pieces of bread but seems to me if they were customer friendly they would of apologised and gave us the french toast. But we only got 10 percent off that's 1.50 each plate for them serving us burnt Bread trying to hide it and taking a long time to make it right....NOT GOING BACK"}
{"text":"Second large group experience here.  Out with a party of 10 at 8pm Saturday night looking for dinner and drinks.  After being told it would be a long wait at R&R, we walked to Saddle Ranch.  They said 30 minutes to get us a table for 10... but volunteered that since we had a wait, they would set us up at the bar and the first round is on the house. (!!!)  The wait was probably a little longer than 30 minutes, but the bartender made great drinks, food and prices were good, and our server brought us a round of after-dinner shots, again, on the house.    I was especially pleased because this is the second time I've come with a large group on the weekend and we were treated really well at Saddle Ranch - that is why I direct all my large groups here.  Cheers to the manager for taking care of us and earning our loyalty.   EDIT:  If you're out on a weekend night looking for a good value for a drink, the AMF is the house specialty.  $13 for a carafe (guessing 32 ounces) of a coconut-flavored long island.  If you ride the bull as a guy, the operator tries to throw you as quickly as possible.  For girls, however, they go pretty easy on you."}
{"text":"Good was excellent! Thanks to Don!!! You are awesome and a great asset to the restaurant! You were helping everyone! Don have great customer service! We will be back to see Don and have one of his great Margarita's!!!!"}
{"text":"Service has been horrible all 3 times we have been here.  The food is ok, but overpriced!  Not a bad place to drink as long as you don't drink fast!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Byron is the best bartender ever!! The food is delicious. The drinks are worth the price. Don't leave without riding the bull."}
{"text":"Don't go there! Noisy and rude waiters. Never got to eat. After waiting nearly an hour after being told a 20 min. wait, we left. Hostess was especially rude and told us we would need to wait another 20 min."}
{"text":"Service was slow.  Food was cold and way overpriced.  I think they raised prices and lowered quality to gouge the Super Bowl crowd since they figured they are rich, from and of town and will never be back here anyway.  I am local and thought it would be a good place to eat.  I will not come back and will not recommend this place to anyone. This is nothing more than a tourist trap restaurant and bar."}
{"text":"Let's see....where to begin. There was so much wrong that my head is still spinning.   A group of us went here last night for a friends 40th birthday. Being 7 o'clock Saturday night, we expected the place to be slammed, but it wasn't, with several tables empty.  Let's being with the service. Terrible; nonexistent. The 6 of us were sat in a section the same time another party of 12 sat. Our drink order was taken fairly quickly. Nothing difficult, waters and iced tea. After about 10 minutes we realized that we hadn't received our drinks, despite 5 staff members standing behind the hostess counter, not 10 feet away, shooting the shit and looking at their phones. We finally went to speak to the manager that if they were going to give this one waitress 2 large parties at the same time, that perhaps someone should give her some help running food and drinks. Despite this, another 5 minutes went by before we saw our drinks. Our order was taken and we began waiting for our food. And we waited, and waited, and waited some more. About 30 minutes, with empty glasses at our tables only filled once. At about the 20 minute mark, the manager stopped by and said our food should be out shortly. I guess 10 minutes is short time. Mind you, still 3 or 4 staff standing idly at the hostess stand. We were there about 2 hours for a meal that should have taken about an hour because of a staff that doesn't give two shits about providing good, prompt service. In fact a woman at the table of 12 complained to another manager and supervisor that was on duty, and as they passed by our table afterwards the supervisor was heard saying, \"How about the attitude on that bitch.\" NOT GOOD, SADDLE RANCH.  And now the food. Ugh. Let's set the stage with what we ordered. Extra thick pork chop with bourbon glaze, baseball sirloin (rare), 2 prime rib (rare, and medium rare), and 2 kids meals. So the food comes out and we dig in. The sirloin came out on point, but was told it was nothing special, with little flavor. The prime ribs were another story. The rare came out medium and the medium rare came out medium well. Naturally we pointed it out and they took them back to the kitchen to fetch the correct cooked items. The manager comes back and says that they had run out of medium rares and that the rare cut that came out was in fact the last rare cut of the night, so naturally it cooked though to medium. Why the didn't tell us this at the time of placing the order is beyond all of us at this point, now that we are nearly an hour into our sitting; so we just dug through the ones that were available. The extra thick chop was about an inch thick. A thick cut should be moist. This was quite possibly the driest chop I've ever had and the glaze was flat and flavorless. All came with veggies and a side. My chop came with about half the portions that the prime ribs received.   I will give the manager a little bit of credit as she brought out 2 deserts and comped one of the prime ribs. This actually saved them from getting zero stars, but it was far little too late. In the 2 hours we were there, our glasses only got filled 3 times. NEVER, NEVER, NEVER AGAIN. This was by far, hands down, the poorest display of service I have ever experienced at an eating establishment."}
{"text":"Great place for an outdoor lunch. Our server Amanda was very nice and offered lots of great suggestions. Always love a night of drinking at this place but guess what? Good food too! Great Jalapeño Mac and cheese (hint:add bacon). Free cotton candy for dessert sealed the deal."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten there yet, but the prime rib dinner looks really good. I have been there on numerous pub crawls, etc. The staff are always friendly, greet you when you come in. Sometimes attack you when you come in they're so friendly. I met the GM, he was a cool guy and easy to work with if you have large groups. Waitresses are all very pretty which adds to the popularity. I haven't ridden the bull yet; it would take some hot woman to get me to do that. Whenever I've been here, I've had a good time, even when it's empty. The one turnoff for me, but probably won't be for the ladies is there are too many men and not enough women here UNLESS it's late at night. Then it seems to pick up in that department. Patrons have been friendly too. One bartender in particular was very nice to me and kept the conversations going. It's a great place to bring a lot of people as they have room upstairs and down and the scenery is good. Pints are a little expensive at $5 each. Better if you go at happy hour."}
{"text":"Horrible place. Walked up at like 1:30 PM with plenty of tables open, however the waitress tells us there will be a 20 minute wait??? What is up with that??"}
{"text":"We went here before a show and I have to say everything was bad. We sat at the bar and didn't know we would be offered a limited event menu. We were granted permission to order nachoes off the menu which for 18 dollars had hardly anything on them. Both drinks I ordered were horrible. Also the chicken tenders hardly has chicken in them and were so gross. The bartender did the best she could but we will never be back to saddle ranch ever. PS the glasses hanging from the bar were filthy."}
{"text":"We ended here on a concert night so everything was crowded. With a handicap van, I had to park three blocks away. That is not the fault of this restaurant, but...this place was so noisy we had to yell at one another across the table to have conversation. The prices in my opinion are rather high... $14 for a burger and the fries are extra??? After eating some appetizers, we left and went elsewhere so we could enjoy our visit with one another. However, the food we did have was tasty."}
{"text":"Been here on a few occassions. Different times of the day, different reasons, so here it goes...  For food: They actually serve breakfast, too, so its open all day. The portions are huge, however, i only had maybe 3 bites of it all (omlet, potatoes, something else I can't remember) and I threw it away. Too greasy. It was so greasy and gross that it left grease stains everywhere. Ew!  Nightlife: The place gets packed pretty quick and since they have valet its nice to leave your car there overnight. If there is one thing, they don't recommend driving drunk. Good for them!!  An event: Ok, here is where I give them props. We organized a fundraiser there for work and they were excellent to work with regarding that! They did a bull riding contest, had 2 for 1 drink specials, and the management there was so nice to do whatever they could to help us out!   Too bad, I can't give it higher than a 3 though. I just can't get pass the food."}
{"text":"How do you run a business like this! Horrible Service! DON'T give them your money... poor very poor service."}
{"text":"Well...I tried to just forget about this place and move on, but could not get the horrible experience off my mind as I found my self telling this story over and over.   I own and operate a couple of small quick serve restaurants and am very familiar with the difficulties in making sure the restaurant and staff are prepared to offer good service with every guest contact, I am also able to recognize when the employee service and overall management is so bad that it should be scrapped (or at least retraining is necessary).  First off, this restaurant remains due to it's location and the sheer number of people who descend to the Westgate Center for the various events being held in the area...not for service.  I am sure it is a different place on weekdays without events, as it would be easy for any manager to coordinate staff, food and customer wait times.   On October 22, I was staying at a Westgate Center Hotel to visit my daughter who attends college in the area. I make this trip 6-8 times a year with visits, and baseball spring training.  Being a busy weekend with an event at the Gila River Center, I called the Saddle Ranch to ask about crowds and seating possibilities for the five of us. I was told it would be getting busier but will be able to be seated in about a half hour.  We came down and got in line, when we got to the hostess area we were told the wait would be approximately forty-five minutes...we put in our name and waited. After an hour I went to the hostess area to check on the status and found that we were still several small groups away. Not a big deal, as we continued to talk and wait.  As we were waiting we began to watch empty tables full of dirty dishes sit and not get bussed for anywhere from twenty to thirty five minutes.  At one point we counted thirteen tables not being prepared for customers or being cleaned.  I again walked to the hostess area and waited behind a lady who was also complaining about the wait, who arrived thirty to forty minutes after us...yet she was seated at this point because she was complaining loud enough?? Anyway, now frustrated, I asked why we were still awaiting a table tafter almost two hours and why someone after us got seated first, the hostess informed me that although there were empty tables, they had no clean dish ware to serve us. I mentioned that if they cleared the several tables that were empty for over thirty minutes they would have dishes, to which she replied that her manager told the staff to stop clearing the tables and just work on getting the food out to those that were sitting.  Funny thing is, that we had been watching this manager walk back and forth between the kitchen and the hostess table never lifting a finger to help any of the restaurant staff.  So unprofessional and uncaring...  Well...we left and went to the Yard House, who had been just as busy but managed and staffed well, and made there best of a frustrating and almost ruined night.  I am sure they provide a decent service at times, but under pressure is where you see the true characteristics of a team and a manager...and this was a complete disaster."}
{"text":"I went to the Chop House for a business meeting and lunch. I have to say, from the immediate greeting we got as we entered this restaurant to the excellent service by the nicest waitress in town with great food, I'll be back. Also, we needed help with our wi-fi and the manager came over and took charge and within a few minutes we were up and going with our business meeting. All in all, it was a great experience. Mike H."}
{"text":"Horrible service 20+ minutes and still didn't get our drinks, hate to think how long it would've taken to get our food if they ever took our order. Yep we left"}
{"text":"I had read the reviews prior to coming here, so I didn't know how my dining experience would turn out.  I had the BBQ Chicken sandwich with fries.  I enjoyed it very much! My server, James, gave me great service!  Food arrived promptly and served hot. James was also very attentive and never failed to ask me how I was doing and if I needed anything.  Also the manager of Saddle Ranch stopped by my table to see if everything was okay.    I will definitely recommend this place.  Very casual and fun atmosphere!!!  By the way, free Wi-Fi too.  Thumbs up on Saddle Ranch Chop House!"}
{"text":"Wrong food and then they re-served part of the old plate and still got the eggs wrong.  Manager did not even apologize and only comped one plate when two were done wrong.  Will not go back. They do not want your business or have any respect for their customers."}
{"text":"Amazing food and excellent service! Appetizer came out super quick and the nachos were delicious! The burger was cooked perfectly and the ribs fell off the bone. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Came for breakfast. Bad experience. My omelete was warm and my hash browns were room temperature served on a cold plate. Noone came by to ask how our food was so I thought I would share it here on Yelp since the Manager does not care. Also 3 of the servers  including the Manager are wearing nose rings that look filthy. They should atleast present a clean hygene appeal if they are facing customers and serving food. We use to like coming here about a year ago. Now the place is run very poorly, cold food, overpriced, and unfriendly. We will not come back until it gets much better."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place 6 stars! Amazing service, friendly staff and Johnnie is the best! Johnnie is a real asset to the staff at Saddle Ranch and they are lucky to have her! I received some of the best customer service I've ever experienced at this restaurant. There were 11 people in our party and we were all well taken care of. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I personally only come here for the nachos, so I can't judge anything else other than that.   The nachos is a HUGE plate and can definitely feed 2-3 people all while enjoying the nice sports bar atmosphere. I usually get the steak and BBQ chicken on it and it is FABULOUS!  The nachos are crisp and the cheese is too die for. The servers can be late with drinks at times, but they're overall friendly and worth the 30 minute drive.   So if you've never been here before, trust me; get the nachos."}
{"text":"Okay so I guess if your gone from a place long enough you forget why it sucks well same gripes sucky service so so food they try to make for it by bringing free shots in a dirty glasses.. Ummmm ya see pics of glasses"}
{"text":"By far, one of the best places to go during happy hour, Mon-Fri. 4-6:30. All drinks & all appetizers are 1/2 off. All. The food is great. They have a very large appetizer menu. My favorites on the appetizer menu are the wings (big) $5 during happy hour, ribs (fall of the bone - great flavor) with sweet potato fries or regular fries $6.50 on happy hour, or my favorite of all, The Monster Platter. Huge!! $11 on happy hour. The Monster Platter has wings, ribs, sliders, sweet potato fries, and onion rings!!! It's a must buy! You also get free food before your order comes out, and after you're done. I can't say what it is and spoil it.   They also have a regular priced menu full of all types of food. Average cost is $9 for a big burger, or sandwich. They have full dinners as well.   Drinks - All half off. All good. Only thing not half off are bottles of wine. Bottled beer is $2.50 to give you an idea.   The atmosphere is very cool. Nothing like it around. It's a 2 story western looking saloon with actual & real farming tools, and other western decor hanging all over the walls. There's a mecanical bull. This is not a country bar, though. All the decor is country, but it's far from a country bar, which is great. There's many big tvs everywhere. They show 80's rock videos on some of the tvs, and that's the music you'll hear. The other tvs are showing all sports games. Great place for music or sports.   We love this place. We've been going here for 5 years. Great food. Great atmosphere. Great prices. Fantastic tvs for sports & music videos. The service is top notch.   I've been to all the other places in Westgate. Don't bother. I went to Buffalo Wild Wings during their happy hour. Mistake!  Their wings were $12. I sat there thinking if I was just a few bars over, I'd be paying $5 for more better wings at Saddle Ranch!   Saddle Ranch is huge, and has a very large wrap around patio with 2 outdoor bars. People take advantage of the great happy hour pricing, and come in large groups. Great for any kind of group event, inexpensive, and quality."}
{"text":"We went in for breakfast and had an excellent meal.  Large portions so come when you're hungry. $1.99 Mimosa's with an entree and great prices.  Service was very good (efficient, smiles, personality).  The only drawback was not much atmosphere as they weren't very busy.  We have eaten here before and had a good experience."}
{"text":"Came here with the family to see what this place was about. (as well as once more afterwards).  Our visit here was \"different\" given the loudness of the place, as well as the decor. For a \"cowboy\" or \"country\" themed restaurant, I was hard pressed to find a decent steak or stiff drink here. The wait staff is more concerned about their own time than yours. Our waitress kept going over to the mechanical bull (yes, this place actually has one) to talk with another waiter who was operating it. Had she actually paid attention to our table, she would've noticed the half empty glasses, as well as the empty plates.   All-in-all: The food was good, but the service was poor. I give it three (3) stars simply because I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. However, places don't seem to realize the importance of good quality service. Waiters would get more tips and people would order more food/drinks. Something for Saddle Ranch to think about."}
{"text":"Had a reservation, restaurant was less than half full, and we waited an hour to only get one salad and waters. No waitress or food in sight."}
{"text":"I just got done eating here, and I gotta say if I can give it a zero I would.  The food was over priced and under cooked.  Not to mention I got to watch the manager (at least I thought it was the manager) hitting on the bartender for 45 freaking minutes while I was waiting on my salad. I will save you 150 dollars by saying do not eat here."}
{"text":"I was skeptical of this place, as I always am when it comes to country/cowboy-themed bars. But I was pleasantly surprised! We came for drinks and sat at the horseshoe-shaped bar. The bartender was nice and friendly to us. All of a sudden, she brings out a HUGE dessert platter to the group sitting next to us, on the house!   No joke, this thing had a cotton candy TOWER on it-- at least a foot and a half high. On either side was a stack of chocolate brownies/cake and chocolate chip cookies. Both were drizzled with chocolate syrup, and there was even whip cream. How do I know this? The group offered my friend and I to try it because they weren't gonna it eat it. Of course we refused but eventually caved in to the deliciousness of it all. The cotton candy was watermelon flavored which I didn't care for, the cookies were too crisp, but the cake was just amazing. Amazing! But enough about the great desserts (which we got bagged to go at the end of the night, by the way...).   Fun atmosphere, great music, nice staff, standard-priced drinks. I'd come back here if I was in town again. FYI, we asked the bartender how they got that dessert; she explained that the guys in the group had asked her how to attract some girls--- she said dessert. Sad part is... it's true!"}
{"text":"one of worst places for service. Been here over an hour and still haven't got our food. Quarter too skinny margarita one of the worst ones I've ever had can't taste any alcohol is watered down. I will never eat here again nor will I recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Happy hour is the bomb! Food is really good! Have not tried the steak yet but will next time!"}
{"text":"Big disappointment. I had high hopes for a lovely meal from looking at other patrons plates as we walked by their tables to be seated. Our server was great and there were numerous other staff that topped our drinks off and checked on us. The food on the other hand was atrocious. 2 of us ordered French dips that were so incredibly salty we couldn't even use the au jus. Which it desperately needed considering the meat was as dry as sliced cardboard. One of the people in our party ordered a ham and cheese omelette. Should be difficult to screw that up right?...he was brought one that had bacon,tomatoes, and onions. The ONLY food that was good was the complimentary cornbread and biscuits with cinnamon butter. There are a lot of restaurants in Westgate. Do yourself a favor and pass this one by."}
{"text":"I can't rate the food because we didn't even get a chance to try it. Saturday afternoon.  130pm. Not busy at all. Staff wandering around not paying any attention to us or the party that came in behind us. After about 5 mins we were seated outside. Another 10 passed. A server came out to clear the several dirty tables and didn't even look in our direction. Service really needs a meeting to review how to serve customers in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite to eat before the coyotes hockey game. We got seated quickly and waited a little bit for waitress but it was busy so it's expected. Once we ordered our food everything was great. The chicken strips were some of the best I've had. I will eat here again"}
{"text":"Food was ok, service terrible. Sunday lunchtime and they had many workers running around, but not very attentive to my party of 5.   Like I said, food was ok but certainly not worth what we paid for it. Was like sitting in a barn, and they played alternative rock videos, one would think a pseudo western place would at least play pseudo western music, too."}
{"text":"If there were negative stars, they would get one. They told us a 10 minute wait. An hour later we left. Unbelievable. I will never be back to any saddle ranch."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative star I would...doesn't even deserve one. Fiancé and I eat at saddle ranch in California all the time and this location is a joke. We went out of our way while staying in AZ to come to dinner here. We ordered drinks, appetizers and an entree to share... as soon as I had finished my glass of wine there was a gunky residue that I couldn't even explain in my glass it was disgusting! The soup we ordered wasn't edible...when the entree came the manager happened to be the one bringing it out we told her  about the wine and soup and she offered a very insincere apology and acted shocked but the place was dead so I'm assuming this is the norm for them.... I was still charged $15.75 for my glass of wine....and left spending a total of $40 for 2 drinks and an appetizer...I did tip the server 20% because I am a server so I don't know if she had other issues going on but honestly the service from the server and food runner were pretty bad too..."}
{"text":"I order the $30.00 NY Steak \"medium\" and it came out well done.  And the baked potato was the opposite... hard as a rock. I would have sent it back but we didn't see our waitress for 30 min.  When she finally came buy and I politely explained my dissatisfaction, she offered me cotton candy... LOL!  My wife's Ribeye was prepared the way she ordered it.  Be careful of the up selling because they'll offer extras but no explanation that it's an extra charge.  Not sure what you get for the price... other than location to the arena."}
{"text":"As far as the night life it's a cowboy themed bar that plays techno house music, that nobody dances to, I don't get it.  Pretty much every one crowds around the token electric bull with drunk after drunk girl getting on (Whhhoooaa!! drunk girl scream), the place has no flow, no energy to it.  The attractive women are few and far between. The door girl and one of the bartenders were good looking girls but the bartender wasn't very friendly, slow, and seemed uninterested in tending that night.  I stood there like 10 minutes trying to order a drink (excuses can I get?... huh no, ok lemme try again, one of those type of deals)  I order my drink and she makes this huge ass like 44oz Bladder buster drink, and its $11 or 12 bucks good deal but she didn't mention the price or how huge it was. I wouldn't have ordered it if I knew, but I didn't want to refuse it and have it tossed out.  I didn't even get close finishing the drink so not a good deal that night.  This really isn't my type of place. I might have been a bit fun if once I got hammered and they had some square dancing going or something that would have been kind of funny.  Also there is this punching speed bag thing that obnoxious RockStar  energy drink t-shirt types like to punch, pretty annoying.  I personally give this place 1 star, but I don't want to be biased so I will give it 2 stars for other people, still not recommended.    If you're a little bit country, and a little bit uhh... techno?"}
{"text":"I haven't been to saddle ranch in a while and today we had the best service! Alex was great, suggested great food and for us to try along with awesome conversation. rare to find. Alex's service was speedy, professional and spectacular! We don't live in Old Town anymore but will definitely be back more often for saddle ranch!"}
{"text":"Food was wonderful! I highly recommend the wings. They are seasoned well (not too much) and taste as if they were marinated and smoked before they were fried and tossed in buffalo sauce. The jalapeño Mac and cheese was a bit thick.   They lost 1 star because it took 20 minutes to get our drinks. They lost a second star when my friend's food came out cold.... And we finished eating before anyone ever came to acknowledge the problem. His second plate never came.   You can ride the bull for $3 and a waver. It's fun! Try it! But no one made it past that 180 degree spin! Fun!"}
{"text":"Single handedly the worst experience I've ever had at Westgate, we decided to come here for my friends 25th bday and the service was horrible, if we even got any"}
{"text":"If you woke up this morning thinking that you wanted to gorge yourself on a giant steak, drink yourself to oblivion, eat loads of cotton candy and ride a mechanical bull, then this place is definitely for you.  I would recommend riding the bull before partaking in said gorging and boozing.  The place has a good sized patio with two fire-pits (where you can roast marshmallows and make smores), three bars, two levels, and a mechanical bull.  The portions are large enough to choke a donkey, so unless you can eat like one I would suggest splitting something with a friend.  The rib-eye was grilled to perfection and the mashed potatoes were delicious.  At $28 though, it should be.  I don't know how it is during the day, but at night the music is terrible and way too loud, but the people watching was definitely good.  I'm giving this place 4 stars just because you can actually roast marshmallows for smores.  That and I really enjoyed watching a prissy (fake everything)  Scottsdale bimbo get bucked off of the bull into a steaming pile of her own vomit.   =D"}
{"text":"This place is out of business as of Monday morning.  The staff were called that morning and to not come in as the owner is closing the doors.    What a douche thing to do.... oh wait it is in Old Town, so par for the course...."}
{"text":"GROSS! GROSS! GROSS! food tasted frozen. The place is unorganized. Ordered a medium cooked ultimate prime rib and it came out 45 minutes later dry, cold, and leathery. Veggies were disgusting and clearly out of a bag. Potatoes were ice cold, literally! Don't bother ordering the kids mac n cheese, it's comes with a small amount of nasty french fries and in a tiny bowl like it was from a cafeteria or buffet. It tasted like crap. The \"jumbo\" shrimp looked so questionable that we didn't even want to taste it. Plus, it was 11 dollars to add on FOUR pieces of frozen, old \"shrimp\". Everything was crap! And don't try to get a plate split in the kitchen because and I quote \"oh, they don't do that, they're weird back there\". Gee, thanks for letting me know weird people are preparing my meal! They need to hire a competent staff and a manager that knows how to manage his restaurant! Totally disappointed! Oh yeah, we waited so long for beer from the waitress that it was room temperature. Yuck. Don't waste your time or money. These other reviews that had a good experience must be paid to say such B.S. Terrible ownership and management for a place that had so much potential."}
{"text":"Fun place for a get together! Had a great server, the food was decent pub grub and of course the bull was a blast! It is a fun spot to hit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Great service !! Very friendly bartender who was a joy to engage with. Defiantly will be back for this great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Where to begin.. Ah, the front door perhaps - where they will scan/take a picture if your ID then take a picture of you. Is this minority report? Then, when you take a step up to the bar, they will ID you again.. Incompetence? Idk, overall. There is nothing special about this place except for an uncomfortable feeling. There are better places to grab a steak and beer. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"1/2 star. Max. I have been to different locations of this chain.  My friend, a University of Phoenix graduate, made reservations here for 12:30 Saturday 5/4 immediately following the ceremony.  A portion of our party arrived early and proceeded to order cocktails, a few apps, etc. Upon the rest of the party's arrival, the service remained decent. It wasn't until we were ready to order and notified the server as such...that our order was not taken for an additional 15-20 minutes.  She instead proceeded to other large party to take their order. Once we finally got our order in...we waited...and waited...and waited for nearly an hour (if not more by some of our party's calculations) for our food. My husband met us for lunch from the other side of town and needless to say...he had to take his food to-go in order to make it to work on time. They did comp his meal entirely as was expected at this point.  Darrell (the so called GM) apologized and made somewhat of an attempt to right the situation with free COLD appetizers prior to the meal arriving and at the end of it giant cotton candy served in large martini style glasses followed by a piss poor dessert of rock hard crumbly brownies. Sorry, that doesn't remedy the situation.  A portion of our meals were comped and rightfully so.  I can understand that they got slammed after graduation...but know your area...and know that there is a COLLEGE GRADUATION right next door to your restaurant!  Getting \"slammed\" is not the guests fault...it's YOUR fault for not staffing appropriately.  When I look around the restaurant and see your hostesses gabbing and standing around while our table fills up with empty and NON-REFILLED glasses and dirty appetizer plates, maybe they need to be trained to do a little bussing as well...i mean, you're ''slammed\" right? All hands on deck?  I guess not.  I will never return to another Saddle Ranch... anywhere...ever. My guess is that many others will not either as this place will not remain open if this is how it's operated. Horrible."}
{"text":"The Saddle Ranch in Westgate had good food and good people. We even got a complimentary dessert just got coming in."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Great environment and awesome service!  Our server even brought us FREE cotton candy for dessert. Try some of their mixed drinks. I could not even finish mine they were so BIG. They were very delicious."}
{"text":"The meal was great...however beware of the security guards/bouncers.  They seem to think they have powers above the law.  Snatched, violently pulled a drink out of my hand while standing outside the wall.  An argument occured due to me having it outside.  I'm from out of city so did not know the rules of Westgate or the establishment...he could have told me to go back on the other side as fair warning in which I would have complied; but his final response was do what you have to do trying to prompt me to engage.  We tried to meet with the manager but staff said the manger was to busy to meet with us."}
{"text":"Eh.  It's alright.   If you want to have a couple of drinks and watch chicks make complete fools of themselves on the mechanical bull, be my guest.  For food and other, don't bother.  I suppose the crowd is a nice change of pace amongst Old Town's usual suspects but if you go expecting a bunch of cowboys (and cowgirls), best to turn around and go up north.  Somewhere.  Far.  The food's crap, the service (at least the server we had) was nice but a little slow (or deaf? or on something?).   I will give it 3 stars, 1 for crowd, 1 for entertainment, and 1 for just being different.    Word of advice, skip the nachos my friends.  *** Edit: My boyfriend would probably give this place 5 stars for the music they play.  Lot's of rock, some heavy metal, old hair bands, and some new stuff mixed in there.  No Rap.  I give it that much.  It was definitely good music."}
{"text":"This place man, this place. My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out last night. We were greeted promptly, got seated right away, and had just phenomenal service all night. Our server and the manager were super friendly and extremely accommodating. We got a comped drink (the MOST tasty shot I've ever had), and our server made really great recommendations. We sat on the patio because it was so nice outside, and we had a great view of the bull riding machine in back of us. We even got to see a pretty good face plant during our meal.  We had the spinach artichoke dip, which they make in house, to start. This dish is ooey gooey deliciousness! The sharp Parmesan cheese they put on top really brings a nice contrast to the creaminess of the dish. It was really great. They also served us some biscuits and jalapeno corn bread. The biscuits were just amazing. They were so light and fluffy! And the cinnamon butter (there might have been honey in it too, we're not quite sure) was a perfect addition to the biscuit. The jalapeno corn bread was very tasty, and not sweet which was a nice change. The butter also went really well with that.  We both had rib eye steaks, I got the loaded baked potato and the bf got the spinach as our second sides. I want to say that I really appreciate the fact that sauteed mixed seasonal veggies come with the steak dishes. It's nice to have a standard lighter side. We didn't get any toppings on our steaks, just the stand alone delicious meatiness. Our steaks were cooked just the way we wanted them and were thick and juicy. Very nice seasoning so you really got the flavor of the beef. My loaded baked potato was HUGE and I really dug the seasoning on the outside. Real bacon is always a must on a baked potato and that's what I got. However if you're not a fan of salt or on a restrictive diet I would suggest getting the spinach instead. The spinach, oh my goodness, this was really great. This wasn't limp, slimy, mush. It was light and still had a bit of crispness to it. They saute it with red onion and garlic. The garlic tasted like it had been roasting for a while as it had a really nice flavor and texture. The sauteed veggies were nothing to write home about but they were cooked and seasoned well.  When it came to dessert we were going to pass because our dinner was just so delicious we wanted to finish everything on our plates. We did tell our server though that we would be back because we really wanted to try out the \"Roast Your Own S'Mores\" plate. She was just awesome and ended up bringing out a comped plate for us anyway! They have a fire pit on the patio where you can roast your marshmallows and assemble your s'mores. It was the perfect way to end our meal. I caution you though, that dessert is built for 3-4 people so keep that in mind when you order it.  We had to box up about half of our dinners because there is just so much food, but it's perfect for lunch today. We left Saddle Ranch saying that we have to tell EVERYONE we know about how awesome this place is."}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME! Our waiter, Alex, was the best! The food was great! We had the prime rib. Cooked to perfection! The waitress brought us free shooters.looking forward to next year to sample some of the other selections on the menu."}
{"text":"Last night party of 4 good atmosphere awesome company service no good .Our first order of drinks never showed, from time we got there at 6:30 our drinks showed up at 7:05 ,food was cold and orders all mixed up. Will not go back."}
{"text":"We were down from Boise for the Fiesta Bowl. Came here for dinner and then came back to spend New Year's Eve. Staff and manager were attentive even in the crazy party atmosphere. Drinks were fairly priced and the food was very good. Don't forget to ride the bull when you come visit!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, the place is huge, they have a mechanical bull. The complimentary bread is delicious. I decided to try the French Dip sandwich (never have, ever) not a fan. (Horseradish is gross) I think you need to go with a burger or big plate to be satisfied with ur meal. Ok service, anytime I go to a restaurant I hate hunting waiter down for refills. I didn't want to rate based on my bad choice of meal, bcuz everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped at the Chop House for brunch.  I ordered the create your own omelette. When the order came out, I was a but underwhelmed by the size of the meal, especially on the size of the plate that I received. The Chophouse should really use smaller plates for brunch and not the big plates used for the steaks. Nothing like getting a big plate with about half the plate full of food. I really enjoyed the hash browns. The hash browns were nice and crispy and had a great taste.    Service was good. There was a foul up on an order at the table. The server offered a solution and went to go fix it but then went to hang out at another table to gab. I was basically done with my meal (as well as someone else) by the time the fix came.  Overall the experience was good, but not great.   3.5"}
{"text":"We went for the first time last night.  We were able to sit outside and really enjoyed it.  Although there were a couple of big parties near us it wasn't too loud.  We were waited on promptly and had a fantastic meal.  I had the salmon which was great and my husband had a great steak, done perfectly.  We were brought a complimentary shot of some liqueur for no reason and asked about our meal and service.  Just a great evening for not knowing about the food there.  I would recommend!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!  I came on my anniversary of all days, because I'm new to West-gate and nothing late on a Thursday night sounded appealing. I have been to the Scottsdale location once many many years ago and it was appetizers and drinks no food. This time was ATROCIOUS.  Let me begin by saying I was with my 15 month old son, and Husband, and I understand children can be loud and messy and sometimes annoying. However, My son is very well behaved at restaurants and we have been taking him out since he was born with no issues or complaints. That being said, when we got seated they stuck us in the back by the kitchen door....UMM No I do not think so....I immediately said something, mind you this place is DEAD they had maybe 5 tables spread throughout with customers. There was absolutely no reason we should be shoved in the corner by the kitchen door. After being seated in the middle in a more comfortable area. We ordered an appetizer and a cocktail for me and a ice tea for my husband. My drink was  WEAK, this 14$ cocktail tasted like juice with a splash of vodka. I wanted to complain but my husband is against it. Also my menu was dirty it had food all inside it. We ordered the 3 hummus platter, when she brought it out she dropped our pita on the ground, It took 30 minutes to get the pita....ITS F**** PITA I am a CHEF it takes 2 second to make pita, you warm it up!!! I was fuming by then.  We ordered kid sliders for the baby, steak myself and a pork chop for the hubby, he got a potato and veggies i got the sweet potato casserole with veggies.  Lets just say my meal was 25.99$ and my steak was so tiny I couldn't believe my eyes..........this was the cheapest steak on their menu but i really was the size of a Lime!! I ordered it Medium rare it came out medium well with SWEET POTATO FRIES! I SAID CASSEROLE TWICE.  Not to mention the pita FINALLY arrived and it was hard. My sons burgers where so OVER COOKED THEY WERE LIKE ROCKS!!! HE COULDN'T EVEN EAT THEM. I was so upset....But my husband the peace maker who never wants to make a scene didn't want me to complain. I was fuming by now. Our waitress took forever for everything, she never asked if we needed anything, i had to wave her down to get ketchup and ask why i didn't get the casserole. I got the casserole when we were leaving so i asked for it to go. they gave us free cotton candy and a F*ing BILL OF 100.00$ I.....will NEVER EVER go back. This place has the shittest cooks, mediocre waiters and just overpriced food. Go eat at Red Robin, or Rocket Burger or anywhere else but here!!"}
{"text":"Went about 8:30 last Sunday.  I had wings and a Coors light.  It was ok. We also ordered a steak which was amazing.  The service was very poor.  We managed to spend 150.00 plus a tip or two. Had to go to bar ourselves.  The young woman that seated us really wasn't interested in serving us. It's not worth going back."}
{"text":"I love the cornbread and butter but the rest can do without. The plates are so huge and super sloppy. The lettuce wraps are no good!  I did like our waitress but the bar tender with blonde hair was supper bitchy to the other staff it was annoying."}
{"text":"My 1st visit to the Yardhouse was exceptional. Sorry for the long post but I took it from my FB I made about both the Yardhouse and Saddle Ranch at Westgate  I wanted to share my two great customer service experiences I had when I went out last night. We started with dinner at Yard House - Glendale after we placed our order my friends food arrived quickly but my mac-n-cheese was taking a little longer. No big deal we weren't in a rush. The waitress checked on us again a 5 or 10mins later still no mac-n-cheese. Turns out the order wasn't placed because the printer cut it off the slip. The manager was very apologetic and took it off our bill. We didn't ask her to so the gesture was very much appreciated.    After dinner we walked over to Saddle Ranch for a drink grabbed a table on the patio and waited for our waitress and waited and waited and waited. A manager was a couple of tables away working on schedules so I asked her if we needed to go in to the bar to order (we had seen a server pass by a few times) She said absolutely not called someone on her headset and a security guard came by to check on us and took our drink order. He continued to check on us the entire time we were there and informed us the general manager took care of our drinks. When we left I got back to my car and realized I had left my iPhone on the table. I quickly drove around, rushed back to the table (the entire time thinking the worst) only to find it not there. I stopped the waitress and she said the security guy that had been helping us had it. WHEW!! So relieved! In a culture of get em' in get em' out to make more money Thank You Yard House and Saddle Ranch for providing excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my boss and another co-worker.  The place looks cool from the outside and the host at the front was very friendly and helpful.  Other than the guy playing the guitar tableside, the positives stopped here.  Our server was the coolest guy in the room, just ask him, he'll tell you all about it.  The food was all terrible.  It was all cold, even the mini cheeseburgers that were brought out because \"the owner wanted to buy us an appetizer.\"  This is a cheesy line they use to make you feel like you're getting something for all of those incredibly overpriced drinks you're buying.  My boss said he was pretty sure that his prime rib was reheated from the day before, and my Salmon had an awful odor/flavor.  The cool atmosphere, friendly hosts, and guitar guy who naile \"Ring of Fire,\" when we requested it make it worth stopping in at happy hour to buy a reasonably priced drink, but otherwise not worth it at all."}
{"text":"Very bad service, food so-so. DO NOT use a credit card! They will tack on more money after you signed and you won't see it until you check your bank statement. Only thing good about this place is the mechanical bull."}
{"text":"It wasn't bad, it wasn't great....  What I liked: our waitress was awesome and the manager stopped at our table when we first sat down and introduced himself.  At the end of the meal, we received complimentary shots!  Cool, I liked that.  The mechanical bull was fun to watch.  The food was okay.  I had chicken tacos and the tortillas were a little tough; I ended up having to cut them and eat it with a fork, then I just gave up and ate the filling only.  What I didn't like was it was so noisy!  You could barely hold a conversation.  We were having dinner with friends we hadn't seen in years so there was a lot of catching up to do.  Probably our fault for not choosing better.  If you want a fun place, go!  Have fun.  If you want somewhere that you can have a decent conversation, choose somewhere else."}
{"text":"We've been going to saddle for about 3 years. In the past it's been great, awesome bartenders great crowd.  But the last few times we've been here it has gone down hill.!  Terribly weak drinks, warm draft beer.! And awful management, and I thank they are to blame!.... Support your regulars,  and we might start coming back!!"}
{"text":"We just went there to celebrate our company Christmas party the Food was super  cold  that is the second year in a row that they ruined our party by serving cold food I will not go there anymore even if our bosses decide to go there again for the next year party I believe we deserve better."}
{"text":"I would have given zero stars but that's not an option. We came in after a football game and sat. We had to go to the bar to order food and waited for over thirty minutes and when we checked on it they had messed up and gave it to someone else. The manager was putting a rush and then it still took 25 minutes. My food was cold,so much so that the cheese was not even melted. I have had the same meal here before and was so looking forward to it. Everyone else's food was mediocre. Things were missing and it just was not worth the hassle. Too bad because we have season tickets and enjoy eating at Westgate after the games. I guess we will find a new place. They are not prepared for big crowds and customer service is sub par."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to have Father's Day brunch here and I must say it was the worst experience I have ever had. Our waitress Gabriella could not have been any less friendly. We ordered our drinks which took about 15 to get each time. The restaurant was half empty since we got there at 10:30 before the rush just avoid a situation like that.  When it came to order our food we placed our order with Gabriella doesn't ask of we need anything and scatters off. Doesn't even return for about another 15 min. She returns 15 min after that with our drinks so we ask about our food since it was going on about 45 min now and she says it's coming.  So we wait. I must say that everyone's food food looked really good except for the fact that my son's French toast was missing the icing and I have to say that my omelette was horrible. I've had better omeletts at IHOP and half the price. Couldn't send it back since our waitress never came back but when it was time for the check.  She handed us our bill which just mine was $102 not to include my sister's  bill for around $60 and that was the first time we saw a smile. Hmmmm  I then proceeded to ask if she was bringing out the cotton candy since we had sat there for 2 hrs and my boys got excited when they heard the other waitress' saying it was on the house. We'll my not so friendly waitress says oh no we don't do that for everyone and we aren't doing it today. I said really everyone around us has been getting them. So after we went back and forth she brought it out.  I feel that we spent about $160 the free cotton candy isn't going to kill her. Or that might just show she's nice and that's prob not what she's used to.  I will prob not return again and if so I'll make sure she does not wait on us and I will not order an omelette."}
{"text":"Whatever you do, DON'T start a tab here!! My husband and I started a tab and had a few drinks. They charged our card and I signed a receipt that friday night. On Monday they charged my card again. This charge was for $67, the original charge was $76. We called Saddle Ranch to find out why, and were told they'd look into it and give us a call right back. 6 hours later, with no returned call, we called them again. The lady on the phone said they didn't charge our card again, and to take it up with my bank. She hadn't even looked into it. After making the (hopefully accidental) mistake of charging a customer's credit card twice, an establishment could at least have the decency to look into it. We've been here several times and received mediocre service. The drinks are overpriced and the bartenders don't know how to make more than a couple different drinks (although they will tell you they will look up the recipe, they then just ignore you until you flag them down and ask for just a beer). We were able to get our money back by disputing the charge with our bank, but after this experience I would never trust them with a credit card again. It's unlikely that we'll ever go back there again."}
{"text":"I've been here before and had no complaints but tonight the food was mediocre and the service inadequate.  They are giving out 20% coupons for the next visit and we left ours knowing we would not return. There are much better choices at Westgate."}
{"text":"I was here last night after the game. The place was packed full. There was bull riding and cotton candy served in very large metal martini glasses. We asked for a table for dinner with a 30 min wait. This was not surprising and we got a table sooner then what they guessed.  However the place was so packed that I lost the host trying to navigate us to our table.  So I went back to the host stand and explained I lost my party. They did not lead me to my table when I ask where my party went. The guy just told me they were somewhere in the front and pointed in a general area. I had to text my date to come and get me. The waitress was friendly and always checked in on us regularly.  The part that really sucked, after we placed our order my date wanted to show me the fire pit to ask I wanted to roast marshmallows.  We left our drinks on the table and we're gone less then 3 minutes.  In that time the host sat another party at the table and took our drinks away. It was bad enough that we lost our table but it was horrible that my $15 drink was taken before I had even had a chance to try it. I think they should have given me my drink back instead of making me buy a new one."}
{"text":"Sucks if you have a party of more than six your screwed on where you sit and all of the staff argues and the manger even yelled at us complete crap came here for a hockey game and we've been standing for about two hours yayy now after getting food and they forgot about our nachos literally forgot. Manager was nice took the beers and nachos off. Now learned the tip is split between waitress hostess busboys AND the bartender the one tip is split between ALL of them. Managers name is Scott he's the reason I gave it more than one star"}
{"text":"First time here was for my birthday last year. Even though place was packed we were able to get a table outside after a short wait. I had never been here before but boyfriend had been a few times with his boss so he was giving suggestions as to what was good. We decided to get the sampler platter from the starters menu since it has a little of everything on it. Good choice. And the drinks, like Matt H mentioned in his review, enormous. Even though place was busy, busy, and busy, our server was great. She definitely made us feel as if we were her only table.   Went again this weekend, not knowing there was a hockey game and had fun time trying to find parking that wasn't out in the back 40. At least we got there BEFORE the game was over. Good thing. Once game let out, place was packed to the gills.   Again we sat outside by one of the many patio heaters. Just enough heat to keep the chill off. This time we ordered sandwiches, boyfriend got the club with loaded baked potato and I got the buffalo chicken sandwich with fries. Club sandwich was loaded up pretty good. My gosh, I don't know where they get their chicken for their sandwiches, but my buffalo chicken sandwich was HUGE. It was breaded, cooked and had a good amount of buffalo sauce then sprinkled with Gorgonzola cheese and very moist and flavorful. We both ate maybe half and brought the rest home.  Lunch for the next day.  Now, on to dessert.  Yeah, right.  Haven't had room for it so maybe next time we go we'll just do that.  If their portion size for regular food items is any indication, then the desserts are huge too.  Have seen a couple of desserts they have.  One is a huge silver martini glass with a tower, and I mean tower of cotton candy.  The other, fixins for s'mores.  There are a few fire pits outside that you can roast the marshmallows over.   Will say if the nightlife thing isn't for you, then try this place during the day or early evening.  Can be a family place during those times, but night, not so much."}
{"text":"I would like to share my experience: Food:  We ordered the appetizers (Spicy Chicken Lettuce Wrap/ Monster Platter/ Jalapeño Mac and Cheese).  Our food was magnificently good and tasty.  Our guests ordered steak and were content with the food and liked it.    Entertainment: No one was riding the bull...unfortunate and the bday boy was not going to share his food on the floor so it was not going to happen.  Service: Megan our server was fantastic and accommodating.  It was my husband's bday and she made it spectacular with a smile and greeting.  She also gave us a free bday gift with a surprise treat at the end of our meal (The Cotton Candy and sweets).  We liked going there and would not mind trying out their bfast!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times...LOVE the Happy Hour! Chilie is really good and enough to share...don't bother with the steak!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, cold food for the second time. Will never return!  My family and I waited for half an hour in what looked to be a non busy restaruant.  The waitress was quick to get our drinks and take our order. After another half an hour we still had yet to receive our dinner. We received our nacho appetizer which was cold.  We requested to speak to the manager. After more waiting the manager arrived without much to say or concern for the restaurants bad service. We paid for our drinks and left.  As we left our friend reminded us of the cold meal he received the year prior. We all agreed we will never dine at this Saddle Ranch location again.  This location gives the franchise a bad name!"}
{"text":"Down here in Arizona on a business trip. Found this restaurant and it is fantastic! Been here twice in 2 days. Drink selection is great and the ribeye steak was phenomenal. Highly recommend! Byron the bartender uses his experience to dazzle us and make us feel extremely welcome. And of course the drinks were amazing. Try the \"Candied Apple\". It won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Johnnie is probably the best server in the west valley.... nay, the best server in the country!!!! Great time!!!"}
{"text":"Been here once.  Good happy hour prices, but just not enough food.  Fun atmosphere, with mock bull riding for those brave enough, \"not me\".  Check it out as they have specials going on all the time."}
{"text":"The Saddle Ranch was a great place for happy hour.  I visited there with a friend the bartenders were awesome, the whole menu was half off, and the beer was cheep.  Can't beat that.  I didn't get to ride the mechanical bull but I'd probably be giving them 5 stars if I did.  Nice chill place for happy hour.  Parking was minimal but you can find a place across the street so the walk isn't too bad."}
{"text":"We go here a lot to sit on the patio in the mornings and cure hangovers with $2 bloody marys and greasy food.  The spicy bloody marys are really good.  It's usually good for what it is, I mean we're not in the state of mind to be looking for excellent food.  Everyone that works there shops at Ed Hardy with the guy from Rock of Love and wears MAC makeup and the people watching is great.  We went last weekend and ordered one of the bloody marys that has peppers and jalapenos in it (it's really good).  The girl comes back with the \"Holy Water\" ones which have onion and garlic.  They were bad and had so many chunks of onion in them you couldn't even drink them.  When she finally came back to check on us (10 min later) we told her the problem and she apologized, brought us the right ones, and comped the wrong ones.  The manager came over to talk to us...he is always nice, just not my style (eg calls my boyfriend \"Bro\"). Then she left for about 15 minutes...we waited...and waited.  Then saw her filling up salt and pepper shakers! Um, there were only 2 other tables there.  She comes over and askes \"Any questions about the menu?\" Um any questions we may have had are long gone because we have been waiting FOREVER.   I ordered a breakfast sandwich, eggs over medium, add tomato slices.  My boyfriend ordered Eggs Benedict. Our meal comes, his was fine (by the way, they ALWAYS serve men first here, it kind of pisses me off and I always notice it, I'm pretty sure they're told to do it) My eggs were WAY over easy and surprise, surprise no tomato slices.  She brought the tomato over when I was just about done with my meal.  Thanks girl.  She tried to make conversation at the end and it was painfully awkward and forced. It would have been understandable if the place was even 1/2 full, but there were literally 2 other tables in the whole place! I mean, come on.  Sad thing is, I go there at least once a month and expect this kind of stuff. PLus it's a fun place to go with a big group at night.  I guess it doesn't really affect anything, so 3 stars it is."}
{"text":"This is the WORST restaurant we have EVER been too,  they don't deserve 1 star. We waited close to 45mins for our food, our friends and I was almost done with our meal before my husband recieved his meal, which the waiter stated he was going to get my husbands meal but never returned, my husband had too ask for his food! The steak was the only food item that was good, the potatoes were  disgusting . The two so called want-to-be managers were a \"Joke\", one manager was rude, she was cocky and VERY  unprofessional. Corporate office big joke! The way they handled the situation made me laugh and think, is there any more real business people in the world that knows how too run a Restaurant and handle business?? I would never recommend anyone too go to this restaurant, stay far away as you can. Last but not lease they need to train their employees, staff need to dress  appropriate and not walk around with half of their (BREAST showing) hire new good cooks or shut the place down......  Rotten Service!!"}
{"text":"Incredibly improved experience.   The new management and kitchen staff definitely shows.  The ribs and ribeye were excellent and the service (ask for Gabriella) was top notch!  We will be returning."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner after taking my parents to the new outlet mall at Westgate. It was Sunday at 5:00, but the place wasn't really all that busy.  However, service was still very good and attentive. Candace, our waitress, was excellent and the manager on duty was checking each table to make sure guests were satisfied as well.  Food was good to decent, both steaks we ordered came out as requested, only complaint was that the rice was badly undercooked so had to dock a star. The nachos appetizer was quite large and our party of three had difficulty finishing it, pretty good value there for those who like to do a little drinking and grubbing."}
{"text":"Right outside the Westgate area where the Coyotes and the Cardinals play.  I would definitely recommend going to the place to pound some beers before the games.  Really nothing to write home about on the food.  You can't really go wrong but you are not going to be wowed either.  It is similar to many places I see right outside sporting venues and it accomplishes the task."}
{"text":"This was my first and last time to Saddle Ranch.First of all they were out of their signature garlic shrimp,prime rib, fish tacos, and chicken tacos at 8pm on Saturday night.I ended up ordering the herb chicken it was flavorless and rubbery.The sides were wrong, I notified  the waitress who brought out the I correct sides that I originally ordered but charged me for all of them.My fiance ordered the sirloin  but ended up with the baseball cut which was overcooked and quite possibly the worst steak either of us had ever  tasted.The  mashed potatoes were cold, not warm,but COLD! We never received any bread or corn bread that was described with our menu choices.I was very disappointed with the tasteless, overpriced food. Do yourself a favor and go to Yard House."}
{"text":"Love this bar. They have a mechanical bull, horse tack on the walls, fun tattooed staff and a full stocked bar. Their food is really good too believe it or not. Average prices for burgers, wraps and salads. Expensive for drinks but your right in the heart of old town and well worth it in entertainment value with the mechanical bull. Not uncommon to see women who should not sit in a high seated bar stool jump on (or rather crawl up with a helpful lift/shove from a male employee). Sometimes it's like watching a car accident, only its funny. So I'de rather pay scottsdale prices for a drink there instead of any other bar just to be able to watch the bull take win after win. Caution: not for the faint of heart, especially when they pull it forward and shake it real fast back and forth while a hefty lady has found her way on it. oooff well anyways. The place is fun, gets way packed on the weekend, and sometimes I have to wait way too long for a drink at the bar or my waitress to come back over to the table. By sometimes I mean 90% of the time especially when its not busy which makes no sense. Still love going there"}
{"text":"Come to this place during Spring training.  Was in 2 weeks ago and ate at the bar during happy hour where appetizers and drinks are 1/2 price. Appetizers are very hardy. Nadia was the bartender and you can tell she not only loves her job but does it well.  She is quick, efficient and very people centric.  Food was delicious and prepared well.  I was most impressed with Byron who I later learned was a manager and bartender.  I had observed him in constant motion, cleaning up, serving drinks, food, filling up the ice, stacking glasses, you name it.  At one point I thought there were triplets. He seemed to be helping out everywhere and I thought he must be truly dedicated to keeping things flowing well.  I love going here; it is a bit noisy but this is a large eatery with drinks and TV with sports and loads of people. One has to bring their patience with and have appropriate expectations.

{"text":"This place has a great western atmophere and very good drinks specials during happy hour. My only issue is the food. Overpriced and mediocre. Come here for drink but skip the food!"}
{"text":"The worst dining experience ever. We had 7 pm reservations & waited 1.5 hours for our food. We had a party of 15 with 4 small children who were tired & hungry. We were told the kitchen was understaffed & servers were scarce. There were however 7+ useless young female hostesses standing at the entrance with nothing to do. When I asked to speak to the manager, one of the girls was extremely rude & did not want to bother to get the manager. She simply pointed him out across the restaurant & suggested I go speak to him if I want. When the food arrived, the majority of our party received undercooked steaks, burgers, baked potatoes & vegetables. The tortilla soup was quite possibly the worst I've ever tasted. We didn't even have utensils. The table next to us actually got up & left after never receiving their entrees. We waited another 30 minutes after asking for the check. I would have had a bit more understanding if the restaurant was packed, but there were several empty tables around us which seemed odd for a Saturday night. The response to our concerns were poor at best & only at our suggestion was the meal comped. This was our 1st & last visit to Saddle Ranch. Extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"The food was great and the atmosphere was fun however I took one sip of my beer and noticed an irony taste in my mouth then noticed something crunchy in my teeth. The beer  had chipped shards of glass in it! When I brought it to the attention of the manager he basically called me a liar saying, \"That's so weird because the bottle doesn't look chipped to me.\" I had the glass in my hand!He replaced the bottle but nothing else was done about my glass filled mouth."}
{"text":"Great happy hour, but very inconsistent kitchen.  Some days the foods out in 10 minutes, the next it's 40.   We consider ourselves regulars , but unfortunately we won't be anymore do to the inconsistency from the kitchen."}
{"text":"We went there this past Saturday and ended up leaving because of the limited menu. Come to find out the Coyotes had a preseason game and when there's some type of activities going on they use a limited menu to get people in and out quickly. Which is not uncommon and a smart business move.  So we where in the area and went back tonight and found out Tuesday is all you can eat ribs. So that's what I got and my wife got the Bacon BBQ Burger. The ribs were great. They came with 2 sides which I was unable to eat because I was focused on the ribs. My loved her burger. The service was great. The waitress was always on time and kept us happy. The manager came by and checked on us twice and was very nice as well. Highly recommend this restaurant. Cost was fair."}
{"text":"Great food, great music, great atmosphere, great staff. Did I miss anything? I love the Ribeye, the Jalapeño Mac and Cheese is as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"Hmm..mechanical bull, old farming equipment hung on the walls...must be a country bar, right?   Well according to whoever's in charge of the music, you just stepped into a nightclub."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying we've only been here for brunch. That said, we've been here several times for brunch, and we've only been disappointed once. That one time was when we sat out in the restaurant and we had a waitress with a huge attitude but the manager made it MORE than right. We were there with several friends, and when the manager heard we had a problem, he immediately rectified it. We were very happy with his response.  Every other time, we've sat at the bar, where Ray (awesome!) was the go-to guy. We have always been happy with Ray's service, and with the menu. Their portions are HUGE. They have several mimosas to choose from, and several bloody mary's to choose from. They are all amazing.  We've had several items on the brunch menu, and we've never been displeased. If we lived a tiny bit closer, we'd be a lot more regular at this place. That said, we do make special trips just for their awesome brunch/mimosas/bloody mary's."}
{"text":"Okay, so a country themed bar/ Resturaunt playing Dokken on the video screen is one thing. But the food is another.  Bland, Late, confused, and completely unremarkable.    It was not out servers fault (at least I hope not) as she was doing her job, but the kitchen and management seem to not care.  My second and last visit."}
{"text":"If you come before a coyotes game or sporting event they are jammed.  I agree the service is good, even when they are scrambling around with a full restaurant.  Usually just have a couple drinks before watching the Yotes.  Small crowd tonight.  I asked the waitress if they made their own veggie burger.  Yes they do. It was good. Friends shared the BBQ chicken sandwich and liked it.  Sides were good.   It is on par with the other restaurants around the arena.  I do agree plastic glasses suck.  We all picked up our beers and said plastic? Really?   Probably a 3.5 but I've only been there on a game night.  The place is full inside and on the patio so that says something.  It's not Ruth's Chris.  It is what it is"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic experience every time we've been to this amazing restaurant. Great service, generous proportions, very friendly staff and just the best tasting steaks and jumbo shrimps I've ever had. We'll always be back to this heaven!"}
{"text":"I only give it a three because it is SO LOUD when they use the intercom to announce your table is ready. Does it really need to be SO LOUD? but the food is amazing! a definite treat!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a1/2 star, or no star at all, I would.  Stopped at Westgate to kill time, bwfore going to the airport, and was the biggest mistake.  First we sat down, and placed drink orders and appetizer orders, then waited 25 mins for those to come out, then placed our lunch orders.  4 different tables were sat after us,  and were waited on and finished 45 mins later.  Finally, after 1 hour our food started to come out, one plate at a time, spaced about 5 mins apart.  Then I was the only one left without my meal, when I asked the waitress where my order was she went to check and came back to say it'd be right out, as the kitchen dropped the ticket with my order... 20 more mins go by and still no buffalo chicken sandwich.  Finally, the manager came to apologize and said my meal was on the house, food would be right out.  15 mins go by and I asked to see the manager again.  He finally came over a couple mins later and proceeded to blame it on the waitress saying she never placed my order. I NEVER got a chance to eat, because when we were getting up, the food finally was delivered to the table.  What a nightmare!!!!!  Do Not Eat here, food was terrible and staff doesnt know how to run business during the day shift.  Seems like it'd be better left as a bar seen. Ugh!"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience ever.  They obviously don't care about repeat customers.  Ordered gluten free meals and found noodles in our vegetables.  Asked the manager to look into it.  They took away our meals to examine them and then made us pay the bill (over $300).  Told us that corporate would call the next day to resolve the issue and refund us.  Corporate called and told me that because we ate our food we would have to pay.  I explained that we couldn't finish our meal and there was no way we ate all the food.  I have never in my life had such bad customer service - both at the restaurant and from a corporate level.  They should be ashamed of their behavior.  If I ran my business that way - I'd be out of business a long time ago."}
{"text":"I live in Los Angeles and frequent the Universal City location and LOVE it! I was visiting a friend last weekend and we were passing through the area and I saw that there was a Saddle Ranch here and was super excited.  My friend had never been, so we decided to stop for dinner.  We got the truffle mac and cheese to start....AMAZING!!!  Seriously, the best mac and cheese.  For dinner I got my usual, prime rib (no one beats their prime rib) and my friend got the fried chicken (I ate some of her's and it is so good).  I was wondering if there would be a difference in the food and service from the Universal location, but there wasn't.  The food was just as amazing as ever and the staff was extremely nice.  The manager, Ashley, brought us the vanilla bread pudding for dessert, which is probably the best dessert ever...I'm not kidding.   We had a great time and the next time my friend visit me, we're going to Saddle Ranch:)"}
{"text":"Came to have a steak dinner, was extremely disappointed im the quality of the food.  It was cold! Not medium rare, lacking flavor! I've never paid so much for a fille mignon dinner and been so disappointed.    The smash potatoes where even terrible,  how does one mess potatoes up?"}
{"text":"Pre Game for Coyotes Game. Quoted 40 minutes, but it ended up being more like 30 minutes for a party of 5. We waited at the sidebar near the mechanical bull. Service was good there, and when the party seated at the bar stools got up the bartender said we could sit there and eat. Should have taken the offer, but waited for the table. We were seated,(4:40pm) and Misty came over to serve us. Some had drinks already, and a few needed refills. We also cut to the chase and ordered a Monster Platter, with a bit of everything. So that round of drinks took 15 minutes, and appetizer came promptly. Then entrees ordered,(5:05pm) and another round of drinks. By this time we see Misty running around, and not even able to wave her down. 30 minutes later round of drinks delivered, and was told they had to change the keg. Game time is 6pm  will we make it?   Entrees delivered by a food runner one at a time (5:45pm) Really? Having a restaurant background I am pretty easy going when it comes to seeing a busy venue, but this was really bad!  All entrees delivered except mine...a rib eye. My wife had to get up from the table to get salt and pepper, plus some steak sauce. We then stopped another server to ask about the missing meal. While everyone at my table is hustling to get the meals eaten in 10 minutes, 5:55pm my rib eye arrives, I turned it away because we needed to get to the game. I asked for the check, and Misty came over saying it was her fault, and she was sooo sorry. She never has a bad day, but her Son was arrested the night before, and blah, blah, blah and she is off her game. Did I want to take the steak to go? I am going to a hockey game. Really?  So they discounted the steak, no visit from Manager, who was clearly visible throughout the evening, but didn't seem to be helping staff much. Overall a terrible night, and game had started by the time we got in our seats."}
{"text":"Took the wife there last night for dinner.  Not good.. Very expensive.. Had one of there stakes for $25,00.  Wow.. Steak was not that good. Potatoes was cold and took forever to get served.. Did not get their bread till after we got our check... More to say but this will be an assay.. Won't ever go back"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Came on an \"event night\" so the menu was limited...very limited.  Picked it because it was close to the venue and I liked their \"full\" menu. Food was decent and the server was very sweet.  The next day I discovered my card was charged incorrectly and it took me two days to get anyone to call me back or attempt to help.  I did get in touch with the manager the next night and I gave him all my info and he said the lady who could help me would call me the next day. Never heard from anyone by 3 pm so I called and tracked the lady down and clearly no one had given her my info or made her aware.  Terrible customer service and unprofessional business practices. I will never return. I have called the corporate office to help with my card charges and still no return call from them."}
{"text":"We arrived around 6:30 on a Sunday night.  The restaurant was about 1/4 full. Bee were greeted by a very nice host who sat us outside.  Everything from there took longer than it should.  We ordered drinks, appetizers and dinner and we ended up spending over 2 hours here.  The buffalo wings were excellent however both salads that were ordered were ok and my steak sandwich was cold."}
{"text":"Ok... what was good? The free cotton candy dessert. Is it free for everyone? No, it was a 'sorry we suck' comp dessert. INFO TO KNOW... If you are going on a night where there are events going on - they want your credit or debit card before you even order!! So what if you are a cash person and don't carry cards? Don't know and neither did our server. :/ Food was cold and overpriced. We waited for quite some time for our silverware though so maybe our food was warm at some point. (shrugs) Our $3 drinks came in the small clear plastic water cups. Why? Because they were doing dishes. Did they bring us normal people glasses at any point? No. Nor did we get refills until we flagged our server down not once but twice. When you bring people food that includes french fries, you normally have ketchup to go along with it. Hmm... waited quite some time for the ketchup too.  In their defense, it was kinda busy BUT your restaurant is in Westgate which always seems to be busy. You should have your service ON POINT by now. It wasn't 7pm it was 4 in the afternoon. The table next to us also waited for silverware and had to rush to eat and pay their bill to make it to the stadium by 6 like we did. Oh and City of Glendale tax sucks, it's like buying an additional meal. Now I remember why we quit going to Westgate.  Again, what was good?? ... the cotton candy. Yay for cotton candy and the sugar rush it gave me to forget that I was pissed that I had overpriced lukewarm food!!"}
{"text":"Ok warning be prepared for long wait times to get in and poor food when it arrives.  When we arrived we were told it would be a twenty minute wait time. After 45 minutes we inquired and were told that they had stopped seating anyone to allow the kitchen to catch up and would be getting to us soon. They seated us about ten minutes after that. While we were waiting to be seated we went to the bar to have a drink. We ordered two diet Pepsi's that were were dreadful tasting. I asked the bar tender what was wrong with them and he told me the soda machine wasn't working properly. And that they were trying to fix it! Why the heck serve a bad drink knowing it is bad! I gave it back and just asked for water instead. After we were seated we ordered two Ribeye's ($30 a plate for a 12 oz!) with baked potatoes. Then 45 minutes later a cold liver looking piece of meat arrived with the frozen veggies and under-baked potatoes. Oh but it gets better when the waitress came back 15 minutes later and we showed her our food and told her it's actually cold to the touch she rolled her eyes!! She offered to microwave the food for us or we would have to wait for it be recooked. After her nasty eye roll and dramatic sigh my wife was over it. Done.  We spoke to the manager and left without eating. We will never be back."}
{"text":"One of the WORST experiences in a restaurant, and that takes a lot! Reservation was at 5:00pm for 10 people. Got there and they said we can't seat you. Offered to split us up. We said fine and manager said we are top of the list. In the meantime they sat 4 tables of 4 and 5 people. Wasn't seat until 5:45pm. Ordered only appetizers to expedite service. At 6:30pm the food had not yet arrived. OUTRAGEOUS! No refills on water. Drinks took 20 minutes. Food came wrong from what was ordered or without sides. Manager sent over nachos, rather than comping part of the bill, as an apology. Not even close to good enough for the situation but a nice gesture. Totally disgusted. Flew in from Chicago for the Hawks game and missed warm ups. Couldn't write a bad enough review for our experience."}
{"text":"3/4/2016 I was taking  my wife and her friend for a good time at SADDLE RANCH. We walked up to the young bouncer and he asked for our ids. He then asked my wife if she was okay?

{"text":"I should just give u my number so u could call me and I could fore warn u as to why u should stay far far away from this place!   Horrible customer service! Had a 30 person reservation- gave our VIP room away and tried to lie because they made a mistake!  Did nothing to make it better in terms of our dinner arrangements and at end gave us cotton candy!  Why thank you- NOT!  I would suggest possible solutions that could have taken place, but event coordinator had zero interest! Shameful!   Food was just alright!  Our waitress-bless your heart- she did her best especially being left to try to serve a group that was clearly upset and trying to celebrate championship!  I suggest working for an employer that doesn't put you in these positions without ownership!   Good luck!"}
{"text":"Usually when you order sliders or mini tacos they bring 3 right? Well I just paid $11 for two tiny sliders... unsatisfactory in my opinion. Besides that it was more like a restaurant for a friday night than a place to party."}
{"text":"I was visiting out of San Diego and my friend wanted to take me on a semi touristy adventure, we ended up at Westgate. It was about brunch time and we were hunnngry , while all the restaurants around there  looked very inviting, Saddle Ranch Chop House stood out to me. It reminded me of an old Western movie looking type of place. We walked in and we were seated right away, this place is huge, and very cool looking inside they even have a mechanical bull that we didnt ride but its there lol. The waitress came and took our order she was  very familiar with the menu which is a great thing, we placed our order, she informed us that the portions were fairly large so we decided we were gonna share. In the meantime, they brought ous a mini loaf or wheat bread and butter and jalapeno cornbread and bitter it was sooo delicious and fresh. (still hot) I was looking forward to what the food was gonna taste like. We ordered the build your own Omlette (you can choose up to three ingredients) if you want more theres a charge with a side of hasbrowns , and cinnamon swirl french toast. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time and the waitress was right these are sharing portions of food. everything was tastey basic breakfast though. the atmosphere is awesome like if thats how it would be in Texas. The only complaint i have was that the waitress didnt really have a friendly personality so she seemed like she didnt want to be there and also she didnt come check on our table for refills too often we had to tell someone who was passing by if they could get us refills. and I had the get condiments from the table next to ours cause she was taking forever to come back to our table. but id come back for dinner just to see if it gets better and to try some steak."}
{"text":"You are a strong, independent customer who don't need this restaurant. If you care anything about the value of your money, you won't spend it here. The food is overpriced for cold, microwaved veggies, French fries, etc. The service is slow too. YOU and your wallet can do much better than this place."}
{"text":"I was just there last night, first and LAST time. Worst customer service from the moment we walked in. The host was horrible. Our sever Nicol over charged us for a double Hennessy and only brought a single short glass and said they couldn't do a double, we asked why and she said she didn't know... Like, what the fuck? We also ordered grey goose and she rang us up for kettle one. She was rude, she took forever, I'd understand if it was busy but it was not busy at all.. We ended up leaving and asking for our tab right after our drinks, never coming back. Thank god for yard house though."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  So disappointed.  No service staff waited on us until we asked to be served!  Wow."}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices! And they always bring out complimentary items."}
{"text":"First off the place is very loud. Food average and highly overpriced. Our food got to our table before our beers. So I said to just cancel the beers. The waitress  brought them anyway, and they were hot, so we refused them, and said we didn't want any more. About 10 minutes later, the assistant manager came over with 2 beers, and said they were on the house. You guessed it, the same 2 beers we ordered, even hotter now. Terrible service."}
{"text":"Even though the the restaurant was slow, it took a little while for a server to greet us. It took even longer to get drinks. The appetizers took a little long to come out and the food took much longer. The BBQ chicken sandwich I had was delicious, however I ordered a Buffalo Sandwich. All the staff seemed confused and busy even though it was slow the whole time."}
{"text":"Terrible food,  terrible service, just plain terrible.  I would have complained if someone had checked on us period."}
{"text":"I've eaten here before. We had good food and service. This time however was a complete abomination due to the lack of competence at the hostess desk. Be prepared to not hear your name called and realize they called it a long time ago. The rudeness when we asked where we were in the list was unacceptable. People put your hearing aids in before you enter so you don't miss your name being called."}
{"text":"Half baked cookie? Try raw and my fries,....microwaved.    I use to love this place but my last few visits have been less than pleasant. That's probably being nice.   They are quite pricy but it use to be worth it as the food was that good but this last year something has dropped. My first issue with this restaurant came on a game night, now I have been here many times before but never on a game night. A few of us decided to go out and I recommended Saddle Ranch. It was happy hour but due to game night they did not honor those prices, I was unaware of that but we stayed. My drink was massively watered down. Normally their drinks are quite strong but that night barley tasted any alcohol in my drink. My friend got nachos and was asked if he wanted to upgrade it with steak and avocado, he said yes. Needless to say ended up being $30 worth of nachos with a handful of steak bits and maybe a tablespoon of avocado, very disappointing. I felt bad for recommending it and blamed it on being a game night.  Brings me to tonight all I wanted was a side of fries and a half a cookie which is my favorite. I called in the order and went to pick it up so I don't have to wait there. I got home started to eat the fries,....they were mushy and crispy on the ends like they had been sitting there all day and were put in the microwave. When I moved on to the cookie it wasn't half-baked it was raw. A pile of cookie dough in a box. When I called the restaurant to complain and asked for a manager I could not get a hold of anyone. Two phone calls later finally got someone on the line, I asked for a manager and was transferred to the Event Coordinator. Called for the fourth time finally got a hold of the manager and let him know what was going on, he offered to make me a new one if I came back which I did not want to do since I was already home. $18 for fries and a cookie and both were awful. He took my name and number and said he would have the corporate office call me back so we will see how that goes. In conclusion this restaurant has gone downhill and every time I go food gets worse. I should have gone to Walmart and got cookie dough and a bag of fries and it would have been better than what I got."}
{"text":"The food ? Extremely boring and ordinary... The atmosphere? Lively and fun .. I'm rating this place as a restaurant, not a bar.   So if your hungry? Don't go there.  If your gonna grab a few drinks before heading to a game?  Absolutely go there and have fun."}
{"text":"Dear reviewers reading, Came here last night. And it was dead I thought so for a Sunday but it was my first time coming here and I liked the food and service we had an awesome server but it wasn't really much. That is why I have a 3 star it wasn't really anything there that was good other than food."}
{"text":"Last Cards regular season game, kids in attendance w/ the parents, and we decided it would be a good time to try the SR Chop House.  We left a little earlier than usual from our Chandler home.  Got to the Chop House by 10:30ish.  On game days, they have an abbreviated menu with breakfast items, sandwiches, salads, burgers, and 2 steaks.  The non-breakfast items they do not start serving until 11, so we enjoyed our beverages.  I got the Ranch Club, hold the mayo and it was GOOD.  Sourdough bread was lightly toasted, the ham, bacon very tasty.  I upgraded to the sweet potato fries...holy cow are they generous with the fries.  The son and husband got huge burgers and enjoyed them.  The daughter got the club wrap and enjoyed it as well.  We were in a smaller room and able to see several games on the TVs.  I will definitely re-visit this place over the Yardhouse.    Our server was friendly.  There was a slight wait for our order, but not too bad.  Either way it scored us a free dessert surprise from mgmt.  I LOVE proactive mgmt.  Maybe the owners/mgrs of SR Chop House can buy out the horrible ownership/mgmt of Bitzee Mama's.  See my review of that restaurant for my dining in hell story of 2008.  Bitzee's doesn't hesitate to make you wait...and for crappy food no less.  After a full season, my choices for dining pre-game:  Chop House Native New Yorker (if hankering for wings, yum) Yardhouse Cracker Barrel Johnny Rockets McDonalds Waffle House Quik Trip Bitzee Mama's if someone puts a gun to my child's head or gives me $10K"}
{"text":"Have been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner.  This is a fun restaurant with good food and service.    For lunch I had the cheeseburger  omelet.  this could have been the biggest omelet I have ever had.  It was just like a cheeseburger but wrapped in eggs.... delicious!!!  We went back for dinner with my daughter and as an appetizer we ordered the cotton candy and brownies and cookie combination.  ( we do things backwards sometimes)  The only way to describe this is decadent.  If there is a negative, it is that it gets loud, especially during football season.    Nonetheless, I would highly reccomonend!"}
{"text":"Slow services, Dirty dishes and extremely loud. If my cousin didn't work there I probably wouldn't have ate there last time. Food is not good and not a family environment."}
{"text":"We went for a Saturday 25th Birthday. It was easy to reserve a table online but prepare for the worse service if you ever get any. We waited an hour for one of our appetizer. When someone ordered a main dish it took over an hour to receive it and some gorgeous others quick or not at all. I would not recommend to go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went around 2:00 pm not very busy... seated right away,waitress greeted us in reasonable amount of time.  Took our drink order, then things sloowwwed way down, took awhile to get a glass of wine and one beer,by the way,ordered house Cab...large size... drinks finally came, was surprised how small it was,and said so to husband.   Kept seeing other servers bustling around quite a bit,but no Haley,she finally showed up and took our order.  Seemed to take too long for two Cajun burgers and fries, which by the way,we're tasty,but food was just barely warm.  Have no idea how long it sat in window to be delivered.  Needed to ask for ketchup which food runner supplied.  Needed napkins , where is Haley?  Spotted her way up front hanging around, flagged her down, (better order drinks now also! )  Again,loooonnng wait, saw her come from kitchen area,with napkins, then to bar, had our drinks in hand,then out to  outside area!!!!   Several minutes later she serves them.  I questioned her about the first wine size, \"Yes,it's the same\" ...Definitely not!   During  meal, no one ever came by to ask us if everything was ok!!!! Finally after at least 20 minutes after being done with our meal,we went up to front desk!   Asked us,how can we help you, \"We'd like to our pay bill\",  Oh,who was you're server?\"  Haley, \"Oh,just a minute\" ! She shows back up after a bit, doesn't say a word to us...trailing, behind her a gentleman approaches us,not identifying himself,starts processing our bill,(I told him the obvious difference between first and second glass),which I could tell he was making adjustments, (good thing  $14.95 for house ,large glass!)  I know he knew we weren't happy,one comment he made...\"sorry,she just got hit with table of 35, really!?!  Not the other hour , she was supposed go be our server!  I knew by then he definitely was some kind of manager,and saw he was writing something down on a business card!  Then he handed  it to us, then identifies himself...\"Sorry, but next time you come, ask for me and you can have a free appetizer\".  Really, next time,don't think so.  I know you shouldn't judge one not so great experience,but there is a lot more choices out there!  Bought 3 other gift cards for our children, $50 a piece, hope they have a better experience,and enough money!!!!  Our bill,like I said,2 Cajun burgers,w/fries,2 beers,2 wines, $79,kinda of pricey I feel for lunch!   Haley, did get a tip, not as generous as we would normally  do...not the runner,or table busers fault."}
{"text":"Horrible from the beginning. Had high expectations of this place based on a friends recommendation. Well it was not as described. First off they advertise specials daily. Such as today, Tuesday, was all you can eat ribs. I was told by our waitress that they didn't do that special during sporting events(the coyotes had a game that night). So I said ok and just ordered a burger. As I was eating my burger the table behind me ordered 3 orders of all you can eat ribs and they were not turned down. So I asked the manager what the deal was. He stated if people complained they were offering that special to them. I thought it was quite rude and a horrible way for a restaurant to handle a new customer. That said I probably won't be back. I just want everyone to know that if there is an event don't plan on getting the advertised specials."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm at West Gate I usually end my night here because they close the latest and everyone is already rushing you out at 1:30am.   My last experience here was just ridiculous. A bunch of friends and I stopped on by after a night of bowling. We all walk in together and the security at the front brushed us off. We all head to the bar and wait on the bartender, only a couple of us were getting drinks cause the other half were DDs, and right away I get pulled to the side and asked to see my ID. At this point I'm annoyed because I extended my ID to the security man at the door and he waved us away. I asked him why is it that he's pulling us aside when we previously offered Our IDs and was ignored. He then asks how much have I had to drink. What does it matter if I'm not ordering drinks? I told him I'm the DD and I'm not ordering anything and why exactly does it matter to him. He then said its because we were loud. Mind you, we all work in a loud warehouse so the volume of our voices have to be loud in order to hear one another. I then explained that to him, even expressing that I didn't feel the need to explain why. Needless to say the guy was a jerk and the bartenders were rude as well. Overly priced drinks, lazy staff, is what you're getting here. I didn't mind the prices before, but it doesn't sit well when you're being treated like crap."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. We waited 25 minutes to be seated, another at least 45 minutes for our food.   Very rushed since we had an event to attend."}
{"text":"It is definitely worth your time to stop here. Make sure you Ride The Bull!!! Saddle Ranch takes the southwestern theme to the max. Then just when you've had enough they bring in a just the right amount of rock and roll. They have TVs on almost every wall in this place, Including the huge projector that plays music videos and sports games on it. Stop by in the afternoon for a drink or a southwest lunch, or swing by in the evening to enjoy the night life. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The wait staff is very friendly and the bartenders do a good job.  Their happy hour is commendable.    The chipotle mac and cheese appetizer is probably the best mac and cheese I've ever had in my life.  They will get their 5th star once they get a bottle of Compari."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience I've ever had. HORRIBLE service, the entire staff was rude, inattentive every single order was wrong. All the checks were wrong. The guacamole took 20 minutes. We weren't even greeted for 15 minutes. Then they fed us \"free shots\" to make up for how horrible everything was, acting like that should make up for it. THE MANAGER ended up taking over and still was getting everything wrong!!!!! And they weren't even busy. If you want an enjoyable restaurant experience, do not come here. Absolutely awful."}
{"text":"If you want the epitome of the Scottsdale/LA wannabe scene this is where you go.  This place is corporate as it gets down to the Ed Hardy wannabe Saddle Ranch shirts a lot of the servers sport... UHHHHHH!!!! How is that appealing in any way?  I was waited on by a very tragic girl as well, I believe her name was Rebecca.  She was pushy and rude.  I wanted to just check out the place and see what they had to offer and if I wasn't ordering what she wanted me to order she really didn't pay much attention to us!  i couldn't believe it!  She was telling us about different things on the menu such as steaks and drinks and was quoting things that she needed to do a little more research on. She really didn't know the big differences of some of the steaks how do you reccommend something and don't even know anything about it?"}
{"text":"I'm basing my review on one meal that I had at the Chop House recently.  Their Citrus Herb Chicken entree was awful.  The chicken was extremely dry, the vegetables were cold, and the jasmine rice was overcooked.    The meal felt as if had been sitting on a table for over a half an hour.  Also, the chicken seemed pretty cheap besides it's dryness.    I would have given it 0 stars if the bartender was not a great server."}
{"text":"I don't care what everybody else says, the food and service was pretty darn good!  Ribeye steak, burger and steak sandwich were all tasty.  Good sized portions.  Fries were a little limp and not very many.  Only had to wait 10 min for a table, and they guessed 20-25."}
{"text":"Worst food it think I have ever eaten! Everything tasted like it was out of the microwave. I ordered the ribeye and it definitely wasn't ribeye. I asked for a manager and told him that the ribeye was a real bad piece of meat and he tells me..\"oh sorry about that... That's how our rib-eyes taste and that's what we get delivered to us. I know it doesn't taste like a ribeye, but that's what we serve people.\" HELLO! They need new management! What a joke this place is. I can say that the place has a great atmosphere, that's about it!"}
{"text":"Nice place but let me tell you about a \"REALLY BAD EXPERIENCE\".  Went in late with family and friends, had a chicken salad and 1 drink.   Started to feel a sick,went to restroom and got sick. As I was walking back to my table \"feeling sick\" to tell family I wasn't feeling well and needed to leave.  Security came up behind me to tell me we had to leave.  We told them we were just waiting to pay the bill and that I was sick and needed to go back to the restroom.  Instead of allowing me the restroom to throw up they physically threw me out the front door.  NOT everyone is drunk!!!!! Me and two of my fiends ate the same thing and all three of us got really sick.  Very disappointed in the treatment I received and security needs to do a better job to identify a real problem of intoxication or illness.  \"BULLIES'."}
{"text":"Visited Saddleback for brunch on a recent family trip. There was no wait whatsoever so we were seated right away.  We all ordered a variety of different items but I myself ordered the steak and eggs with potatoes and a side order of sausage.  They also brought out some jalapeño corn bread which was pretty good. To drink we all had mimosas. The food was just ok. The steak was medium rare and nice tasting. The eggs, potatoes and sausage had no real taste and everything was pretty dull. The waitress was really nice and brought us free shots so that was a great gesture. Nobody in my group was completely enamored with their meal. For the price it was a bit of a let down. Will maybe try again in the future due to their good service. Perhaps their dinner might be a bit better. Waitress advised that the nightlife there is awesome so might have to check it out."}
{"text":"We ate here twice while on a business trip from Atlanta in June. The first time, it was just a few of us. The second time, it was our entire group. As expected, they group experience was a little less pleasant.   Overall, I really dug the atmosphere, but the food left a good bit of room for improvement. The food was rather drab. I had a burger the first time and a steak the latter. Both were somewhat bland. The burger was not cooked the way I ordered and the steak was somewhat tough. This being a steakhouse, I expected quite a bit more.  The only thing that found itself worthy if 3 stars was the service and the atmosphere. Everyone I encountered was super friendly. The staff was more than willing to accommodate our group and I hate being the one to say it, but the food was a let down. If you are just going to have a few beers with friends, this is a great place, but if you're wanting an awesome meal, I suggest you go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Pretty cool, the chips and guac was okay The filet mignon wasn't the most amazing thing, and def wasn't work $30, but for maybe a $15 or $20 steak it would have been good.  They have cotton candy that is flavored like cheesecake or something, so if you're a sweets lover you'll probably enjoy it.  The bar is on point with all of the options, the drinks are a little pricey, but it's a good time watching all the drunk people get on that bull.  Worst case scenario, bar hop around the area and you'll have a good time. But remember to bring your money. Lots of it."}
{"text":"good location, nice setup, but wasn't super impressed with the food. Excellent service and the Mechanical bull was calling my name... but think I'll save my bullride for next time, after a few jack n cokes!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty decent, though kind of generic. I really liked the truffle mac and cheese. The servers were really, really friendly, but they were incredibly short staffed. There was a half hour wait but tons of open tables, and the food took over a half hour to get to us (though there were no flaws in its preparation). The free cotton candy at the end was a nice gimmick. In sum: nothing really wrong with the place, but not too much to really say."}
{"text":"This is one time I'm glad I did not read the reviews before I came. I found him on Open Table and you had good reviews. So, let me start with the service is outstanding with Byron at the bar but he was very friendly fast and very informative of the menu. I got the combo Chicken & Ribs which both were outstanding.  the flavors on the ribs just popped in your mouth it made me smile with all of the goodness going on in my mouth. You should try it to get the flavorful excitement and  experience what I can't put into words.  so the chicken had a lot of flavors in itself along with the jasmine rice and cilantro. I would recommend this and I will come back. Thanks Byron for awesome service"}
{"text":"I only ever get to come here before Cardinals games these days, as I don't live in the area anymore, so this is really just a review for the pre-game-day experience.  They do a pretty good job with atmosphere, cycling people in with a decent reservation service, and most of the morning games on. Bartenders are attentive, the servers are normally adequate, and the area is spacious.  My only issues are with the price, and the strange food selection - breakfast ends before it even really makes sense to get to the stadium, like 10:30. Some extra time to grub on some eggs and bacon would be nice, but then they switch to their lunch/dinner menu, which I believe is limited for game day (I could be wrong on that). The portions are ridiculously huge, which wouldn't be a problem in most cases, but I don't really want to feel like it's time for a nap by the time the game started. And with the portion size, comes a pretty high price for each item.   Really, it just comes down to menu diversity and how busy this place can get in the mornings on Sunday. If you're not there early, it's going to be a while to get in and get out."}
{"text":"Bring your appetite because this place serves up huge portions!  My sis and I visited last week for an early lunch.  I've had their jalapeno mac n' cheese before and opted for this again with a side salad.  I personally love the mac n' cheese and think the jalapenos give a yummy flavor.  Not spicy at all, just enough to give it some flavor.  I didn't even put a dent in the plate, and had leftovers for dinner that night.  SR also serves up $2 dollar mimosas with purchase of a meal.  Awesome! I did the Bahama Bubbly and The Classic.  I wouldn't complain if they poured a little heavier with the champagne.  Overall, A-OK experience."}
{"text":"The food is ok. You're really paying for the staff & atmosphere if you ask me. It's a great patio place when the weather is good in the AZ. Great for drinks, apps & people watching."}
{"text":"I will never, ever go to this place again.   I've gone to happy hour a few times with coworkers after work and the service, as well as the manager/owner (long hair, goatee) are just the rudest people on earth.   If you have more than 4 or 5 people they won't split the check individually, meaning, someone has to front the bill for everyone. Hey guys---- it's 2012 and people pay with debit. Your friends down the road at Dos Gringos have no problem opening and closing tabs on a whim or splitting the checks between 20 people. Take a hint.   A girl was vomiting out front because she had, had too much to drink. She was there literally for under 5 minutes- she puked once and was trying to get her stuff together. The people she was with were trying to get her together as well and the manager/owner came and YELLED at them. He threatened to have them arrested if they didn't leave IMMEDIATELY.   After that incident, I cashed out and left. If you own a bar and someone is vomiting, either help them get to the bathroom or offer them some water. Threatening to have them arrested is just trashy.  On that note, it doesn't surprise me that this place was dead on a Saturday at 12:30 AM. This place sucks.  Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Tortilla soup was super spicy and delicious ! Chrissy at the bar was super attentive, friendly and helpful !! Food and service was amazing"}
{"text":"I had some friends in town this weekend. They were staying in North Scottsdale and I am in Gilbert. I remembered hearing that Saddle Ranch had a good hangover breakfast. It was a good middle spot. We show up and the place is empty. We could not find any staff so we seated ourselves on the patio. When the waitress showed up the first thing she said to us was that next time we are here we must tell someone we are sitting outside or we won't get served. Well, we would have told someone if there was someone to tell...  We ordered our drinks and they took forever. Our waitress (Ms. Personality) came back to take our food order. We all had some sort of egg dish. 3 people in the group ordered EB's and asked for runny yolks. When the food finally came out, their eggs we like hockey pucks. Ms. Personality said that is how they come...whatever.  I had the Huveos Rancheros. My eggs were done perfectly so no complaints there. The food was still completely forgettable. Portions are huge but who cares when the food sucks.  The manager came by and we told him about the eggs and he said \"thanks for letting me know\". That's it nothing beyond that.  The girls that work here look like someone put their clothes through a paper shredder. A little ridiculous for 9:00am.  Bypass this place and go to The Breakfast Club across the street!"}
{"text":"Come here to drink. Don't come to eat. The service is a joke. Slow food movement has a new definition.  We got our food one plate at a time. Torture. Seriously got here at 1pm. At 230pm still waiting on food.  Train wreck.  Don't order grilled cheese because they don't use oils?  Dry warm bread with melted cheese makes a grilled cheese. Wth?  Same with the hash Browns."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile but experience was overall pretty good. They even gave us a few shots on them, seemed to be a thing they do so not that it was overly special but was nice. Food was good and great service."}
{"text":"The classic was cooked exactly how I ordered it. It was tender and flavorful.  Veggies and smash potatoes were great too. My hubbys baked potato wasn't cooked all the way but the manager made up for it with a round of drinks n dessert on the house. So I chose...."}
{"text":"Saddle Ranch is awesome! I recently started coming here again because the staff is exceptional and are definitely on top of their game as far as being friendly and knowing how to tend bar! Our serve Alex B was great and concocted some amazing shots for us. I enjoyed his level of service so much that I recently had my birthday at the private upstairs bar and was blown away that saddle ranch gave us free champagne to celebrate! This is now my go to bar in old town!"}
{"text":"1 star rating for design and atmosphere...the food was gross. I am not a picky person at all but this was just not good, on top of that the prices are stupid. There are 100 other places I would go before here again. Next time I'll eat at home or McDonald's before here, and McDonald's is nasty too."}
{"text":"Cailey and her trainee Britney were very FUN and SEXY too ..  Mark the manager was very nice too - Thank you -  food was great"}
{"text":"Just a comment: I was just 86'd and I have no idea why. I was in the process of paying my tab and I had a small issue with being charged exorbitantly for cocktails after the Fiesta Bowl. I simply questioned the charges and I was immediately asked to leave. I have no issue with paying for a few beers, but a 250% jack on a few Mexican beers is ridiculous.  No explanation. Just an escort off the property. Not a good experience overall.  Would not recommend SR to anyone other than unsuspecting folk."}
{"text":"Just had brunch here on Christmas Day.  Not typical bar food.  Got the breakfast sandwich.  Hash browns perfectly crispy.  Husband got chicken n' biscuits. Yum! Heavy on the vodka in the cocktails. Love this place!"}
{"text":"We gave them a year to fix their service issues and went back this week. We had a large party. Two of the people with us never got their food! I mean they NEVER got it after several complaints to the wait staff. Same thing happened a year ago! Their solutions is to bring watermelon shots none of us wanted. Seemed like an excuse. The manager finally came over, apologized and took money off the bill. However when we left with our two hungry friends I let him know that this happened last time and we stayed away for a year. He said \" Well Ma'am if the same thing keeps happening I would just never come back!\" No joke! The manager said that about his establishment. He got his wish and the privilege  of my 1st ever YELP review. None of us will EVER be back!"}
{"text":"FLYS, FLYS, and MORE FLYS!!!!!!!!! Had to eat our meal swatting flys hoping that they didn't land on our food. Also birds flying everywhere in the RESTAURANT! DISGUSTING! And people were feeding birds while we were eating, NOT OKAY. Good server(Christopher) but, it used to be so much better. Overpriced for okay food. Never again."}
{"text":"Nice bartenders. My group spent a small fortune on drinks and the bartenders gave us a round of Christmas shots for free.  Food was gross though, I will not eat that crap again."}
{"text":"So we made a reservation. We showed up on time. And then we were told that we only had an hour to dine b/c the restaurant was rented out. Um - you should have told us BEFORE we reserved a dinner slot and made plans with family to meet there. Not okay. So I can't comment on the food but I won't try that place again based on principle."}
{"text":"Arrived in the parking lot 10 minutes before my reservation time. I didn't know that there was a hockey game that started around the same time. It took over 30 frustrating minutes to find a spot to park. Then had to walk over a quarter mile to the restaurant. When I finally arrived, I was disappointed that they didn't serve there full menu this night. I was looking forward to trying their BBQ combination. What a waste of time to eat a hamburger. Never again."}
{"text":"Very disappointing and they just didn't seem to care. I researched a central place for a group coming from around the Valley to meet for a late brunch. I was excited to see that this place served brunch until 3pm with $2 drink specials. Once seated I went back up to the hostess to ask for a brunch menu and was told there was no brunch or drink specials today because of an event. The lunch menu was a bit disappointing with few options that seemed overpriced. We were sat at a table that hung out into the main walkway so a few of our party kept getting bumped by staff and customers. They serve everything in GIANT bowls and platters that just make it difficult to fit everything on your table. The BBQ chicken chopped salad was a huge disappointment- I asked for no tomatoes which meant I didn't get any other toppings either. The explanation given was that the toppings are premixed with the tomatoes. This may have affected my ordering decision and a good server would have mentioned this up front. I can make chicken and lettuce at home. My chicken salad was also lacking much chicken. Before the food even arrived the manager came by the table and asked how things were going. I attempted to let him know I felt like there was a \"bait and switch\" with the brunch menu and information presented online. He immediately shut us down and said it was because if an event at the stadium. I pointed out there is no mention of this policy on the website and the event wasn't for another 2 hours. The other frustration was the server just couldn't keep our drinks filled- this Phoenix people! I spent my college days waiting tables and my husband has been in the food service industry for 16 years, we try to be understanding and realize sometimes things happen, but this was such a collection of awfulness I just had to let people know."}
{"text":"Here is a lesson on how to achieve 1 star on yelp:  1. Party of 16... come by every 45 minutes 2. Take 30 minutes to fill 2 drink orders 3. Stare at the table from across the room, notice everyone staring back at you. Don't come back to the table for another 20 minutes 4. Charge 18% gratuity automatically based on party size. Most restaurants have stopped doing this, take notes.  It is obvious our server didn't give a fuck about his job. The manager (or some dude that looked like a manager telling people what to do) was there that night and he didn't notice even when we complained as he walked by.  I hope you close down and something much, much, much better comes. Like McDonalds. Even McDonalds is better than you. Think about that.  p.s. Your free cotton candy is the worst cotton candy I have ever tasted. You should be paying me to eat it."}
{"text":"Tried then again... Yep- they suck!  Nachos were light and not tasty at all.  They use water down cheese sauce..gross!  No happy hour during events.  They don't say that anywhere until you get there and sit down.  Drinks are watered down anyways."}
{"text":"Holy cow! $2 mimosas and bloodys til 3 every day. And many to choose from at that. Try the blue cheese Bacon burger!"}
{"text":"We've been to Saddle Ranch a few times on the weekends for a late breakfast and have been pleased with the food and service on both occasions.  While far from upscale, the atmosphere is unique and has a nicely put together \"wild west\" theme.  The food is inexpensive (approximately $10 for a breakfast entree) and as such, the quality is nothing to brag about, but the meals are a good value for the price.  I've had the egg-white veggie omelet and the huevos rancheros, both which were flavorful and not greasy.  The hash browns are a bit bland, but edible.  They also offer $3 bloody marys and mimosas.  The death valley extra spicy bloody mary has good flavor, but the mimosas are a bit heavy on OJ and light on the bubbly, although what do you really expect for $3?  This isn't a place that we'd be likely to try dinner at, but we'll be back for another breakfast or maybe try out lunch next time."}
{"text":"Cool spot to hang with kids or friends. Good food, great service and very welcoming. Oh yea they have a mechanical bull."}
{"text":"Giddy up boys and girls!  This is a fun, casual evening spot to grab drinks (& food) with your friends. From hanging out at the bar, the spacious patio with stone fire pit, or at any of the oversized wooden tables... you will recieve prompt and friendly service.  Drinks are well poured. Had a few too many drinks and want to ride the bull? It makes for great entertainment for those like me who love people watching anyways.  This place is definitely a 'high energy, rock-western experience'.  *please note, this is a review of Saddle Ranch as a spot to hang out, the food has not been tested by yours truley*"}
{"text":"A Jersey girl in a cowboy bar...One would never think.  However, this Jersey girl checked out the newest restaurant/nightlife addition to Old Town Scottsdale...Saddle Ranch Chop House.  And I have 2 words...LOVED IT!    This restaurant/bar first garnered attention in Hollywood.    I didn't have the opportunity to eat there, but I did enjoy a frothy beverage!  The patio is big...and the selling point is a mechanical bull!!  Great western bar, fun atmosphere and a bull!  I will update my review once I eat there.  But you must go!!  **UPDATE***   GO ON SUNDAY BRUNCH!!!  $1.99 Mimosa and Bloody Mary's....The food is good too!"}
{"text":"If I could do less than a one I could. Not busy. Shitty service. Didn't even get water. Sobered up before I could get a drink. So unprofessional our server took shots with a customers in the bathroom, had to bathroom to fill up bathroom. Been here for over an hour and gotten nothing."}
{"text":"I've been a customer of Saddle Ranch for a couple of years, and have never been disappointed by either the service or the food.  As a matter of fact, the first time we ate there our waiter was training a waitress; they were both so attentive and friendly, that they were the reason we returned a second time.  We have received the same level of service each time we returned, and we have never had reason to complain about the food.  Today was exceptional, as we approached the door, a waitress came out to us literally with open arms and gave me a hug.  It turns out this was Johnnie, she had been our favorite waitress at the Texas Road House.  This being Mother's Day, the restaurant was busy as expected.  I asked Johnnie to seat us in her section. The hostess told us it would be a thirty minute wait, and we were okay with that.  We were seated within ten minutes!  Johnnie gave us the same super service we had come to expect of her at the Texas Road House. The steaks and ribs we ordered were cooked to perfection, and the sides were as tasty as one can expect.  Knowing that Johnnie is working at Saddle Ranch, we'll return more frequently and we'll be sure to ask for Johnnie."}
{"text":"My little brunch crew and I have visited twice now and our experiences were insanely different.  First visit: -Sunday morning, few patrons. -Party of 8. -They organized the table and sat me so I could get a drink and some apps out before rest of my party arrived. -5 separate checks, no issues.  Second visit: -Sunday morning, few patrons.  -Party of 8.  -They told me I couldn't be sat til at least half of my party had arrived, so I had to wait 20 minutes with 3 of my friends til we decided to finally lie and say we were a party of 6 just to be sat and get some drinks. I get that's how some places do it, but it wasn't a packed house, so I don't get why that had to be an issue.  -Drinks were slow to come out because the bar was \"backed up.\" Again, the place was deserted, so that was a little off to us. But, the second round was free due to the slow first round, so that was very nice of them.  -Steak and eggs were overcooked. Rare and under-easy? Nope.  -We ordered a vanilla brioche for a friends birthday, only to be told they don't have it, even though its on the menu. Not that they were out of it, but they just didn't have it.  -5 separate checks were needed, but we got 3 because she said that's all the computer would let her do. We know this not to be true, as that was not the case a month ago. I don't know what the strategy was, but she didn't pair up person to person, so everyones check had someone elses food/drink on it. She also gave us our checks before we were ready to leave. Don't do that. You didn't need that table because there was any sort of wait.   We came for the cheap mimosas and all we got was a reason to find a new place to brunch."}
{"text":"De Anna the African American female bartender was extremely rude to me and my friends. She was very degrading and unprofessional when handing a situation. She wouldn't serve me which I understood because I had an up and down California id.(although I'm almost 24 lol) I told her the law was stupid and she asked me to say it again so I proceeded like she was asking because she didn't hear me not because she was acting like a smart ass. She then snatched the two drinks out of my friends hands that they ordered  and started yelling security security!! Frantically like she was about to be mugged or hurt. I left immediately before security even came because this was out of line and totally ridiculous. I was very unhappy with the poor service, the way she treated me and way she acted towards me and my group. We had just got there and were not drunk or out of line what so ever. Hope you guys can make better hiring choices in the future. All other employees were friendly and awesome except for her:("}
{"text":"I don't typically write bad reviews but this place is pretty bad. It's got a decent atmosphere but it took over an hour to get our food. It took 20 mins just to get a refill on water. The food literally made me sick to my stomach. Probably because they were so behind on people's orders that they most likely skipped fulling cooking the food. Keep away if you can unless you just want to have a drink at the bar."}
{"text":"My BFF planned an awesome dinner here to start off the evening that was my Bachelorette Party.  Our party of 10 or so were seated smack in the middle (near the bull) at this huge round table and we had the most attentive waiting staff ever (our server gal was accommodating with the size, our orders and the bill... AND she even  bought our table a few rounds of shots! .... Kickass!!).    The manager was attentive, too... after convincing my drunken butt to get on the bull, he presented me with a gift bag with a hot pair of knickers inside that had their logo and some skanky phrase printed on it... I've never worn them, but, hell, I thought that was pretty great for making my evening feel special!  I'd also like to point out that on this particular night, there was a HUGE hockey game (Wings were playing) next door... so even with a busy restaurant, their staff did a great job of providing awesome and memorable service.  I don't recall what I ate (probably because I didn't eat so much as I socialized), but I do recall one of my gal friends (vegetarian) ordered their Sweet Potato fries and it came with this amazing marshmallow dip ... it was so yummy.. finger lickin' good.  I think this is a great place for anyone wanting to start off the night in a fun atmosphere with great staff..  I can't vouch for any of the food, 'cept the sweetpots but I was delighted it turned out to be such a perfect start to the night."}
{"text":"Service was good  and the ribs were very tender fall off the bone.  They have all you can eat on Tuesday's. I might have to come back."}
{"text":"What a disappointment ordered food which had hair in it and they offered a discount of 10% I didn't even want to finish the food . Never again will I go here."}
{"text":"Drinks where great but service not so much. Got my food but no silverware. Finally got it after I was done eating. In glad I didn't get pasta. Lol .."}
{"text":"This place was OK.  We came here for a work function and they had a sectioned off place for our group which was really nice.  The service was decent but the food was OK.  Not good enough for me to want to come here on a date night with hubby but for a company dinner, the portions were pretty generous.  Side note: horse radish here is super spicy.  I'm a light weight when it comes to spicy foods but even my husband who can handle more spicy foods than me thought it was on the spicy side, too.  To each their own!"}
{"text":"I have to admit I actually liked the Saddle Ranch.  Did not eat here just had some beers and watched my friend get tossed off the mechanical bull a few times.  Very Funny!!!!  Very diverse crowd.  Good Music and clean bathrooms - what more do you need."}
{"text":"Came here before a Coyotes game. They got us seated really quickly despite how full it was. However, after 10 minutes of everyone just walking past us and never coming take any orders or say they would be by, we flagged someone down and she took care of us immediatly and was a great server. I would have overlooked it had the food been good but the food wasn't anything memorable. We had nachos which didn't have hardly anything on them. The jalapeno mac and cheese was decent but room temperature. The beers were really over priced, I guess because of the game, I don't think a restaurant should change their prices on game nights. The atmosphere is fun but I wouldn't be back on purpose with so many choices around the area."}
{"text":"Worse service ever, we received our table fast (really) no wait with reservations.  We saw many wait a while and sadly most right next to our table. Took a while for them to take our orders; even longer for our drinks; and even longer for our food; and the bread was not brought to us till we asked for it twice. Sadly they brought our food and walked away so quickly they did not ask if we needed anything and we were not able to ask for silverware.  At this point the service was so bad and disappointing we were all laughing about it, because we could not believe it was this bad.  Then the security guy came to us (I guess thinking we were having too much fun) and asked what was wrong. There we sat, a table full of food; no bread, no napkins, and no silverware.  He laughed too and said he thought that was real funny. We were all a little thrown here and asked if he could help because we could not flag down a waitress to save our lives. He laughed even more and he could not find one either so he went and got the silverware and napkins himself. We asked about the bread too but he noted the waitress would bring it and then we all had a good laugh about that possibility. Now most of our food was cold; one of our dishes was not cooked completely (but I will say I took it home finished cooking it and it tasted fine). There we were half through our meal (not me & 1 other in the party, I can not eat uncooked or cold food and I was not going to make everyone miserable with me) no bread, no condiments, no refills when the 1st waitress finally came close enough to snag. She said she would but didn't come back with ours refills till the meal was completely over and yes, and yes again you guessed it...still no bread.  We gave up at this point and ask for our check and asked for a discount due to some of the issues of our meal and never receiving our bread. She promptly came back with our check and wait for it... Our missing very cold bread with butter which was so hard and cold you could not spread it on the rolls.  And of course no discount but the nerve to mention \"I hope you all had a nice time and meal!\"  There was no way that was the case and she knew it. You could tell by the way she looked us and said it. But really complaining never works, you end up looking like the a__ yourself. And shocker we left a tip anyway. But we will never go back to this place, it's  not worth the repeat of torture. There are too many wonderful places to eat in this town to ever go there again. Don't waste your time, money, for the disappointment."}
{"text":"My wife and I stayed in Glendale last week. We tried Saddle Ranch for lunch. Beware, the portions are big and the taste is awesome! Our server was fantastic, love the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"So I had the worst customer service at Saddle Ranch I've ever had before and every other bartender has been the greatest that I've had but this was the worst customer service. I went back to ask what the bartender's name was but they wouldn't  give their name they just ask for the manager and the manager was busy. We will never go back if she's working"}
{"text":"best kept secret for breakfast in old town.  i ordered the open faced breakfast sandwich and was so happy!  it comes on a creamy texas toast base with your choice of prepared egg, bacon and a side of hash browns.  I went over-easy on the egg and my mouth is watering just thinking about this breakfast.  it was so good!  the plus here is adding a bloody mary was only $1.99 with breakfast.  me and my girls got a round!  why not?"}
{"text":"We went here for a happy hour get together. There were nine of us. We all shared food and got different plates. How sad that every single thing I tried was totally disgusting. In addition to this, the service was really slow and awful."}
{"text":"Came here the other night in a party of 17.  Overall the experience was satisfying.  The waitresses were nice (yes, some had serious cleavage) and they were mostly on top of things - ordering the kids plates first, getting drinks/orders put in.  The drinks were huge - I had a margarita which was served in a wine carafe.  Unfortunately there was hardly any alcohol in it so I supplemented with a shot of silver tequila.  Probably could have used a couple more shots!  I had the baby back ribs.  The order was huge and I did my best.  The meat was tender and the sauce spicy.  Overall it exceeded my expectations (which weren't too high given what I've read here).  The plus was the entertainment value with people trying to ride the mechanical bull.  Only one person from our group did it - after 4 shots of Jack Daniels!  Overall a great place to go to if you're looking for a casual place with some eye candy, decent food, and side entertainment."}
{"text":"Rib eye was good, sides were good. Had the largest cotton candy :) service was good. Food came quick and price was decent ..."}
{"text":"We made it to Saddle Ranch a couple of times.  The first time was for dinner on my birthday.  The food and service was very good.    The second time was a few months ago when we had gone to McFaddens for drinks.  My wife apparently had a few too many 7 and 7's and decided(without my input) that she was going to \"ride the bull\" at the Saddle Ranch.  So, We made our way into the bar area and she paid the $3 fee and signed the release papers.  She was then taken to the bull and seated on top, awaiting the beginning of the ride.  I asked the operator to \"take it easy on her\".  He did not listen or did not care.  The bull started to move and made less than one rotation and she fell off, landing on her back, facing straight up looking at the bull.  I am not sure she knew what happened or how quickly it happened.  Needless to say her mechanical bull riding days are over.  Hopefully anyways!    This place is worth a visit.  You will have a good time."}
{"text":"server was ok clueless but ok . my experience goes down hill from there. the food bland, over priced, cold, and disgusting.  the place was empty and they just didnt care. very unprofessional staff for the most part."}
{"text":"What is there to say about Saddle Ranch that hasn't been said before? Nothing.  This is a solid place to grab a few drinks, but the menu doesn't always get a fair shake.   The food is quite good here. I've never been let down. The chicken tortilla soup, the wings, the onion rings, the rubs, the wraps....everything is fantastic.  Also, look for the GM and strike up a conversation with the guy. He's a pretty cool dude. I remember a few times he would come over and bring us a gigantic martini glass full of cotton candy on the house. A nice gesture for bring regulars.  Service has always been good here, the food has always been good. The drink menu is creative and I LOVE the beer selection.  On a side note, I refuse to ride the mechanical bull. You can though."}
{"text":"Food just ok. We went with about 40 people and the served us a buffet dinner. Drinks ok but the BULL RIDE was AWESOME. Definitely gotta ride the bull."}
{"text":"Way overpriced. We sat down and really wanted to leave but we stayed hoping that the food would be worth the price. We ordered 3 appetizers and an order of fries ($6) and our bill totalled $93. Food was cold but the waitress was even colder. When all the people around you coning in sit down, look at the menu, and immediately walk out you would think they would treat the people that stayed a little better. We were never offered any refills and sat for 30 minutes waiting for our check when I flagged what appeared to be manager down. Never an apology from the server. Oh well. Buyers remorse all the way home. Consider yourself warned. This place is a tourist trap."}
{"text":"Visiting from the east coast (NJ/NYC), this place was an absolutely great place to experience the southwest! Food was delicious and flavorful, the atmosphere was exciting and different, and the service was warm and welcoming.  They even have a mechanical bull to ride haha! Definitely a spectacle for nice chill night out. Their brunch menu is served until 3pm, and the mimosas and bloody marys are on point!! The Saddle Ranch is a MUST TRY!!"}
{"text":"Had to walk out of this place. Awesome full menu online. Went for an event and they said they only have a limited menu on event nights. Why would anyone be at west gate unless they were going to an event? I'm seeing closure like their Scottsdale location in their future."}
{"text":"mechanical bull + random really drunk people = a whole lotta fun"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with the service here.  Made a reservation online for Mother's Day Brunch for 10:45 am.  Got there early (10:30) and realized I probably didn't need to make a reservation since there were only a few people there.  Checked in and they said it would be about 10 minutes ... I understood we were early, but so weird since there were a ton of open tables that they wouldn't just seat us.  After 10 minutes they walked us over about 10 feet to a table that was right in front of us as we stood waiting ... no clue why they didn't plop us down there when we got there???  Took a while for our waitress to take our order, which was strange since it wasn't busy at all.  After our party of 5 chatted for a bit we realized it had been quite a while since we ordered and still no food.  Our waitress finally came back to refill our drinks and said our food would be out in a few minutes.  It was 40 minutes from the time we ordered until we got our food (don't know why it took so long to make scrambled eggs), then it was all COLD!  I'm not one to complain about food at restaurants, but I've never gotten food that was so cold like that.  I'm guessing it was ready for a long time and our waitress never got it.  Again, it wasn't busy at all, so I have no clue where she was or what she was doing (someone else brought the food out).  We called the manager over to tell him about our food and ask if there was a reason for the delay and it being cold.  All he said was \"I can get you new food\" with no explanation.  My kids already started eating because they were starving.  Eventually, they brought out new food for two of us.  In the meantime, the place still wasn't crowded, so I can't imagine what it would be like if they were busy!  Our waitress finally came back to refill our water and never said a word about anything.  They did comp one adult meal and one kids meal, but there was never an apology or explanation.  Very disappointed I chose this place for my Mother's Day brunch.  The food was decent, but the service was horrible.  We will never come here again."}
{"text":"Food is good.  Service is not.  Two nights in a row, two different servers, same story \"the ticket got lost\"  \"the kitchen messed up the order\".   So when you order here, ask you server to check and confirm that your order was in fact submitted.    The servers are nice but something is broken in how they submit food orders."}
{"text":"We went for brunch and so should you.  Highlights: $2 Bloody Mary's and Mimosas You can go with 6 people and feed everyone with one order, the one $10 plate will easily feed six.  (Honestly, I ordered the pancakes and you give me three 12\"-ers?  Are you kidding me?)  What I found funny is that while I love the chophouse, it sort of summarizes the maybe not so pretty parts of American culture: Super size, over indulgence, excessive drinking, cow girl waitresses who's dress implies objectification, misters that consume resources to make us comfortable.*  *Disclaimer - I'm not judging, just commenting, I had a great time indulging in all of these things."}
{"text":"Have only gone here for food & drinks before a Coyotes game...It's on par for Westgate. High prices but, the food was good. Our waitress was excellent however, the bartenders were great to look at but, the service lacked. They kinda had an attitude - maybe it was just too busy...  Anyway, good for game time or a concert yet, definitely not a destination spot."}
{"text":"Well, I rode the bull.  For 18 seconds!  PRO:  they pour a really full glass of bubbly (probably doesn't get ordered often).  CON: it is cheap crap bubbly! The service wasn't particularly great and the food wasn't particularly great.  These factors didn't bother me much as I was out celebrating with work mates.  I think marshmallow dip is the most revolting thing ever...but others loved it.  I will say...I would never order a giant cotton candy thing but someone else did, it was beautiful and I had a couple nibbles :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our 16 year anniversary here.  The food was good, not great, but good; however, our server, Teresa, was the best server we have ever had anywhere.  As a former server I understand the importance of making people feel welcomed.  She comped my drink because I didn't like it, she gave us 2 free shots for our anniversary and was extremely attentive!! Would go back again, especially if all of the servers are like her!!"}
{"text":"the most terrible servie EVER!  took 18 min to get water, and our waiter never came with our appetizers... after looking around for 31 min i think a manager got a feeling something was wrong... he came up and i explained we had been waiting almost 35 min and never got our appetizers, took 20 min for our drinks... and then all of the sudden there was ALL of our food. minus the ONE THING WE WANTED.... i wish i would have left and not paid them for the meal."}
{"text":"Very loud and terrible service. We waited 1.5hrs (currently- debating if we should leave) for our food - as did the table next to us. One table waited 2hrs and left. The place is big and no where near full. They brought us three shots of some pink liquor as an apology... They do have a mechanical bull, that was semi fun. Won't be coming back ever."}
{"text":"It is hard to be two different things.  Is this an Expensive Steakhouses or a Bennigan's?    Even though the food is really good this place is not nice enough to justify the upscale prices.  It has a fun atmosphere, but $15 margaritas should not be served in a plastic carafe.   I am sure the cost of that location is astronomical, but I doubt straddling the line between two identities is the way to go."}
{"text":"I won't be going back to this place anytime soon that's for sure.   This was a terrible experience. For how much the food cost I would expect to get better food and service.   I understand it was busy due to a big event around, but they were plenty staffed and warned the event was coming. It wasn't that busy in our servers section so not sure why service was so slow. He was nice but didn't really pay attention. I'm not sure if it was his fault or kitchens but all four of our dishes came out wrong. Randomly my friends had no bacon, my other friends came without extras he ordered, one was cold and my salad literally was a bowl of lettuce. I ordered the ranch salad with chicken and I got a bowl of lettuce with barely any cheese and that was it. I asked for my chicken and my server acted like it was my fault. For $16 for a salad I expect more than lettuce with a ramekin of chicken for $4 extra.   Later that night I had a steak dinner and two drinks for only a bit more. Had I'd know this place would be so terrible I would've skipped lunch. $16 on a bowl of lettuce is terrible.. I've had way better salads for a fraction of the price. For $16 I can get a pretty awesome burger and drink at better places.   Last time I go to this place that's for sure. Pathetic service and food was lame."}
{"text":"Bad service.  We waited for 30 minutes to even get a drink of water.  We ordered the monster platter and it didn't have ribs on it and it took almost an hour to receive.  Never received biscuits, had to ask.  Felt ignored totally and then to compensate they offered a free dessert which we refused.  They did comp our monster platter upon our request and gave us 2 shots of jolly rancher - very classy.  Do they want us to forget this experience?   Never going back."}
{"text":"Not horrible, maybe I've been here on bad nights. Drinks are expensive and bartenders are inattentive. I suggest getting an Adios M.F. because it is $13 and served in an OJ carafe, so you only need one. We also discovered go for the bottle of beer for $2.50 rather than the draft for $7. The draft is only a couple ounces more, so get yourself 2 bottles!"}
{"text":"Second visit here.  Very disappointed  to say the least.  My Hamburger  was under cooked even though  I ordered it med well.  The fries were hard as a rock mixed w  seemed to be microwaved fries.  So were my sons so it wasn't just me.  Place was not very busy at all as it was around 1:30 pm on a Saturday.  We placed our order at 1:40 pm and was served  to us approx 2:30 pm.  I can't say it was the waitresses fault I'm sure it's more on the cooks.   Next time we will stick w yard house .  Better service , better food, better atmosphere.  Price is exactly the same."}
{"text":"I had been here to drink before but never to eat. Service was a little slow and the food was a little too normal. I know it is a bar but i was hoping for either hearty portions or some good BBQ or Grilled flavor. I got none of the above.   The vibe in this place is pretty cool and the crowd is pretty good looking!"}
{"text":"Been a couple of years since we had been here. Now it will be even longer next time.  Sub par food steak sandwich so tough couldn't cut with a steak knife as well as over cooked. Employee trying to find manager and cannot  find to adjust our bill. Do not recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"I went there for Sunday Brunch twice and thought it was a fun place to go with the girls.  The Brunch menu has a lot of options including french toast, omelets, pancakes etc.  The portions are huge so if you go consider sharing.  They also have good brunch drink specials."}
{"text":"Went here before the Cardinals game. We were there about 3 hours before game time. Table wait was about half an hour, but we found a spot at the bar. Beers seem a little expensive, but that's okay. At the bar, we got 2,shots on the house and the nachos were very yummy.  We've been here before and I remember the food bent good then as well. The one bartender is. Prime candidate for FLBP but we had Byron, who was awesome, and this other incredibly cute girl (Hayley.), who was also pretty awesome. So, compared to the other bars into the are, this is the place I'll revisit for pre-game festivities."}
{"text":"Went to Saddle Ranch with friends for the first time a month or so ago... That visit was fun. Server was pleasant, we got our food & drinks quickly, everything was great for the price. Something huge must have happened between then and yesterday. Place was a wasteland, but we had to wait for a table. Took forever to get our first round of drinks because the \"bar was backed up\" with the dozen other people in the building (they did apologize for that, and comped our next round, that was nice). Food was cooked wrong, the menu included items they don't even have, and we kinda wanted another round when the server brought our bill out. Then the bill was all jumbled up. My food was on one tab, my drinks on another. Plastic drinking cups were cracked and dirty. The girls want to give it another try, but I'm pretty sure I'm done with Saddle Ranch."}
{"text":"I don't come here for the nightlife. I like their food! Portions are big, steak nachos and BBQ quesadilla are the things I come for."}
{"text":"Fun place for dinner. Great environment and their staff is very friendly. Best appetizer ever is their jalapeño mac and cheese!!"}
{"text":"No happy hour or 15% discount from hotel because it was a Coyotes game day. Herb Crusted Chicken was over cooked so it was dry but at least the baked potato was ok. Service was good she kept my drink filled."}
{"text":"Worse service ever!!!  Table was sticky & full of crumbs.  Greeter/host just removed the dirty glasses & sat us down.  Apparently, the previous customers got tired of waiting & left after drinking water & eating biscuits.  Menus & flatware were still wrapped in napkins.  While we were waiting (20 minutes) for someone to just ask us what we wanted to drink, we watched 3 other tables sitting across from us, who were there when we arrived, get up & leave because they were tired of waiting.  We would have left, but, we decided to see how long it would take for a server to come by.  Finally, a young lady asked if she could get us something to drink.  Turns out she wasn't our assigned server, but, we told her we were ready to order.  While we were waiting for our food, a manager came over to speak to us.  The Monster Platter was good.  but, the steaks & main entrees were pricey, & probably something we would never order because it would be served cold by the time the server walked approximately 150'+ to get it to our table.  Poor layout for a restaurant.  Kitchen is too far from tables.  As we were leaving we overheard 3 other couples/families complaining about the poor service.  It took us 3 hrs to get served & eat a house salad & appetizer.  Unreal!"}
{"text":"Overpriced but decent top sirloin was rare instead of medium rare.  Burgers were also undercooked a bit, but edible.  The main thing was extremely inefficient staff.  We came before a hockey game and watched each employee running around without any clear purpose.  Tables were mostly waiting to be bussed for 10 minutes or more while workers went back and forth in confused and panicked fury of activity.   We felt bad that we didn't tip our waitress, but her efforts to keep up made her overwhelmed and caused her to basically sling food and walk away without actually seeing if our needs were met.  Fire the manager and get something like a system going."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Rude bouncers and hostesses. We were so unhappy by the time we sat down we didnt even order food. We left and ate at another olace around the corner. I will never return and I definitely don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I came here for a friends birthday party.  We had about 15 of us in our party and the birthday girls husband had made reservations in advance.  The staff was unorganized.  We ended up sitting in different sections.  It took FOR-ever to get a brew and the place was dead.    The food was surprisingly good.  I ordered the seared tuna salad which was awesome considering where my expectations were at at that point.  The dressing on it was perfect.  My wife ordered the salmon and fries which was also pretty decent.  To wrap it up the bday girl road the bull, we took pics, paid the bill, and got the hell out of there.  I would have given it a 3 if it werent for the lack of service and slow drink refills."}
{"text":"So I can see why this place has bad reviews but our server Bandon took great care of us. He was extremely accommodating and got us everything we need in a timely manner. Food was great and fun atmosphere. If we make it back def asking for Brandon!"}
{"text":"We wandered in here after seeing just how ridiculous some of the restaurants around the area charged for dinner- (I won't name the places, but we were looking for somewhat of a good deal. It's hard when you're in Scottsdale, I know).   Anyway, as we get seated, I notice that the menu is pretty big and they definitely have a large variety of food, from salads, steaks, to sandwiches and such. We sit outside since the weather has cooled off recently and there was a nice, warm fire pit to sit by.  The waitress was really nice and our order came out very quick, surprisingly quick.  The full rack of baby back ribs I ordered was pretty succulent and coated in sweet sauce. Veggies and mashed potatoes on the side were okay, but the Fuzzy Navel they made for me was perfect. Especially since it was happy hour! Kris had the prime rib and the same sides, everything was large in portion and I could barely stuff another piece of food in me when we finished it all. I had to wash my hands (and face) after the bbq ribs, and the bathrooms were exceptionally clean to my surprise.  I think I'm coming back to try the rest of the menu, there's too many things I wanna try!"}
{"text":"I gotta say - though the scene can be a bit overwhelming here sometimes, I actually like this place!  The food is surprisingly really good!  In my opinion, there is nothing better than chicken tenders when I'm a little banged up, and this place has the best in town anywhere ever.  They're awesome.  I havent had many of the entrees, but after sampling just about all the appetisers at this point i'm pretty pleased.    I've always had great luck with servers, all very personable and nice, though not always the speediest especially if theres a big crowd.  Though on some nights I could go without the cowboy-it up decor and flavor, they play pretty decent music and is comfortable outside."}
{"text":"This was my very first visit to the Scottsdale Saddle Ranch but have been to the LA location a couple of times.  I was never really impressed with the food, or service for that matter, and assumed my over payment was for the location.  But, this review isn't about their LA location so back to business...  A few friends and I went for happy hour on Friday around 6:30 pm.  They weren't too busy and we were all able to get seats at the bar.  Our bartender was great, in fact I'm pretty sure I told her I loved her.  The service was fast and the food was actually good.  We started with the sweet potato fries.  Holy f-bombs, they were amazing.  They came with 2 dipping sauces, a spicy ketsup and a cinnamon frosting somthing or other.  I'm not sure we spoke too many words during this time, just shoveling, and watching the other to see if they were going to take the last few- greedy.  We also had the nachos.  Not as good as the fries but were so very good.  One of my friends asked if he could hold the plate while we finished eating all of the stuck on cheese.  Yes, please!  These were huge so plan on sharing.  The last thing we had was the cotton candy.  For not liking cotton candy, I sure had a lot of it.  It was good but after a bit, and I'm sure due to the warm weather, started to get a little funky.    We did also consume adult beverages.  I had beer and it was, well, beer.    Overall, this place was good and yes, I am a fan.  I'm not sure I would go during rush hours.  Oh, make sure you ride the bull.  My friends had a blast."}
{"text":"I visited this location a few months back but my experience is still fresh in my memory.  I visited the LA location on Sunset Strip a few years back for drinks...the atmosphere is fun.  I returned in March at the Glendale location for dinner with my parents after a White Sox Spring Training game.  We all had steak - which we all enjoyed, even my very picky father who refuses to eat in any kind of \"chain\" restaurant.  The service was decent as well but go early as this place does get crowded. (We ate the night before at Margaritaville also at Westgate)  Finding a decent place while on vacation can be a difficult task at times but we did well with this place (being from Chicago)  It's a decent place to grab a decent dinner or go for drinks and get entertained by those riding the mechanical bull :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here on a Thursday night and it was one of the best dinning experiences we have had.     I broke with my vegan diet for the evening and had the Salmon.  Cooked to perfection.  The fish was flavorful, moist and hot.  The side dishes were also appealing and filling.     The atmosphere was inviting in a Western/Coyote Ugly way with plenty of room for sitting and moving.     I wish I would have taken a picture of the plating.  It looked like a presentation on Iron Chef.     I would recommend this restaurant for date night anytime you have $60-$90 for a meal.  (Our meal with an appetizer, 2 meals, and 2 drinks came to $75 after tip)"}
{"text":"I love love their huevos rancheros. Rivals my previous fave at Breakfast Club. I especially love the super slammin' bloody marys!  I must admit and agree with most of the other reviews, the service is spotty and the food is slow. Perhaps that's why my entree was cold?? Ya think?! If it weren't for the terrrrific manager who came to check on me, I would have canceled my food, finished my drink and left!   Brunch/Lunch is about all I can stomach though. Any other time feels like you were blasted back to college! Cool if that's your age group.  $2 MIMOSAS AND BLOODY MARYS"}
{"text":"Overprice drinks at bar.   Dropped by to get a drink before going in Coyotes game and the drink price was the same as inside arena.  Ten buck draft beer and 14 bucks House margarita.  Will not go there again."}
{"text":"After two amazing trips here, I'm happy to give a full 5 star review. Our food was always cooked perfectly, and out pretty quick. Most steak houses you order sides with your steak that you have no intention of eating cause, well, the sides usually suck. Not here. The mixed veggies are seasoned, buttered, and roasted. So is the asparagus. The rice is cilantro and has great flavor. French fries are some of the best restaurant fries around, and the chicken strips are hand breaded with very thin breading and a whole lot of chicken.  Each time we've been greeted by a manager and our servers (Naomi the 2nd time) were attentive and fun. Can't forget the amazing half baked cookie. So good. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Where to start with such a terrible expierence, the $9 budweisers, the still frozen appetizers, the need for a pre-authorized credit card before I even order.   So let me start with we went here be default because we were on a time crunch before a coyote game, this was not my first choice, and now I know why bar louie and yard house were packed and this place was a ghost town.  I sit down with 3 other people and before ordering the server says that since it is an event day with the coyote game they need to preauthorize my credit card or pay cash as I order, this kinda ticked me off but whatever, I was hungry and in hurry.  We ordered a sampler platter that included sweet potato fries, cheeseburger sliders, \"jumbo wings\", and onion rings.   The wings were served cold and were below average sized wings  The sweet potato fries were undercooked and raw on the inside, but some were warm, until my girlfriend bit into one that was still frozen   My brother ate one of the sliders and spit out a small piece of bone  The onion rings, by far the worst, they were either undercooked with cold onions and hot batter, when you bit into these they would spill water out everywhere turning into an unappetizing mushy mess or the onions themselves were still frozen.  I told the server and she brought a manager over that said he was going to grab a small plate and some of the food and show it to the chef I told him to take the whole plate, we're not eating it anymore. while we were waiting the server brought us some shots on the house for the inconvenience.  The shots tasted like cough syrup and when we asked what it was the server said she had no idea and asked us what it tasted like. Even though 2 of us took the shot, and the other 2 were left, do you really think it is appropriate to bring shots as some sort of compensation for food that bad without first asking? Just because it's Saturday night doesn't mean I'm looking to get hammered.   To wrap this up, I had to ask if they would be removing the sampler platter we barely ate from my bill which they did reluctantly.  And the final damage, for 4 pints of beer... $33 before tip. I'm not cheap, but that is just outrageous.  Avoid this place like the plague, it is part of the reason westgate is failing"}
{"text":"The initial impression comes from the facade which is very inviting and creative and the Western theme continues into the building. It was refreshing to see TV's showing music videos instead of entirely dedicated to sports. The music videos are punk, rock, metal, alternative, indie, basically different modes of rock. That was really enjoyable. The service was also excellent, we had a waiter that actually waited on our every need which was also refreshing. He was extremely helpful, friendly, and went out of his way for everything. Big thanks Chris. The food itself was okay, nothing ridiculously special, especially for the price. This is a place to hang out and have a drink than to go out and eat."}
{"text":"For starters, the decor is awesome. It is OLD TOWN SCOTTSDALE. Saddle Ranch, and it's \"western vibe\" make Old Town, feel even more \"Old Town'ish.\"   The restaurant has a patio AND a huge interior, with plenty of seating, a bar, and a mechanical bull. It just wouldn't be the same without the mechanical bull, now would it?  But, let's cut the crap and talk about what's really important... the food and drink! In that order.   I am a big Wedge Salad person. Their wedge is official, an actual wedge of iceberg lettuce, topped with bacon, bleu cheese, tomatoes and all the fixings. It's big enough for me to call it dinner. I like to pair it with a light wine, and then get my fattening grub from the boyfriends plate (which is usually ginormous!)   Usually my bf gets the ribs, and as the side he gets the sweet potato. Now, this isn't your mamas sweet potato (unless she's Paula Dean). This is an amazing griddle served hot, with burnt marshmallows on top and you can just taste the brown sugar! Mmm..   And as you finish your dinner, full as can be, they bring out a festive bowl of cotton candy. Me and my boyfriend played with it more than ate it (I can't believe I just admitted to that), but it made the night even more fun.  The drinks are very good, wide variety, just strong enough + they have flavor. If you order a \"signature drink,\" be ready... They are HUGE. They are enough for two to share and way too much if you have work the next day and want to be coherent.   Perfect place for a Tuesday night happy hour, dinner, or a Sunday lunch.. I would go to this place all the time (as in weekly) if I wasn't more adventurous!"}
{"text":"Bad Service  Good food we were out last night celebrating 2 birthdays and our server Elizabeth did not make our visit fun or even pleasant.  She was not knowledgeable, did not smile and really could care less.  Not sure if Saddle Ranch does anything for Birthdays but she did not even say Happy Birthday!  She had no idea about what alcohol was on site and messed up a simple drink order.  The food was the best part of the dinner, everything food wise tasted great!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool because the place is big! You get to ride a mechanical bull which me & my friends rode bahaha. Note, do not wear a dress! Free matches, no cover. We rode the bull for free and then they tried to charge us later."}
{"text":"My advice would be not to eat here if you value your life! I had a simple beef dip with fries,it tasted so old like they had to thaw it from deep freeze after 2 years,horrible!!!!!I was literally Ill for for days,wil never eat ther again"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place for dinner before going to before the movie.  There a quite a few restaurants at Westgate, so we looked around and chose this Saddle Ranch.    Wrong choice!  The hostess was friendly, and we were seated right away.  The waitress had a great personality, but service was average at best.   This place is a little on the pricy side.  The food didn't justify the cost.  I had a baseball cut sirloin, which came with a vegetable medley and one side.  I chose the loaded baked potato. The vegetables were the best part but were just OK.  The steak was supposed to come with choice of a sauce, glaze or butter, but is was left off.  It was no better or bigger than a Chili's or Applebee's steak, but was twice the price.  The flavor and tenderness of the meat was just average, but was cooked to the the way I ordered it.   The baked potato was large, but had been sitting in a warming drawer for a while and had that off-putting old baked potato taste.  I ordered it with the loaded potato part on the side.  I thought a loaded potato had butter, sour cream, bacon bits, chives, and sometimes grated cheese.  I got a small plastic container with about one tablespoon of sour cream, and barely a teaspoon of butter.  I ate some of it because I was hungry, but left over half.  Later, when the waitress asked about the meal, I told her about the old potato.  She told the manager.  He came later asked about the meal and offered to replace the potato, or substitute another side, but I was done eating.  He said he would comp a desert.  The waitress said that we were getting the Vanilla Brioche Bread Pudding.  We waited for at least another twenty minutes, but when she finally brought it, she brought an ice cream sundae, saying the were out of the bread pudding...the final letdown.  This is a very attractive looking restaurant, but I don't understand why the kitchen would send out a substandard meal unless they just don't care  Maybe that is the norm for this here.  For a place that bills itself as a chop house, it leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Came in just the other day for my dad's girlfriend's birthday dinner with our family. Three of us order a Chipotle burger and none of us got any sause for our burgers. We each had to order some. Also my grandmother's burger came almost burnt when she ordered it medium rare. Would have gave less stars but our waitress was great at her job. Also disappointed that it took them 20mins to put on the hockey game in our seating area. Tip for management, when someone asks for a sports game they usually mean the local team or they would say otherwise."}
{"text":"Horrible food!!! I hate to give bad reviews butter I have to be honest-Don't waste your time or your money!  The manager did try to make it up with a cotton candy tower but we wanted a great steak and burger-that's just not going to happen here!"}
{"text":"i went in with a larger party, about eight people on a Monday night. We were seated promptly outside, as requested... I was pleasantly surprised by the cooperative temperatures at night and the quick service, it made for an overall positive experience. Aside from a slightly longer than expected wait time for the food (likely due to the group), our appetizers and then food arrived shortly thereafter The quality of food is well above average and portions are generous, dare I say excessive. Definite notables and must tries include their filet mignon (just don't order it well done, it'll come off as a bit dry) and their guacamole. Coming from a hispanic background, i'm particularly annoyed by the green paste that some restaurants put out. I was pleasantly  surprised that the guacamole put out by this place was as good as it was.   All in all the experience and food was good. Just an FYI however, they will not split checks for larger groups."}
{"text":"Our family loves to eat at the Saddle Ranch. Plenty of food to fill you up. We love their Prime Rib. We usually get great service and the food is cooked right and quickly compared to other places. My daughter loves their Cotton Candy dessert."}
{"text":"Wow! After waiting an hour for 3 hamburgers, what we got was absolutely horrible. I ordered a well done burger which came out half raw, my dad ordered a well done burger and his was even worse. My mom ordered a turkey burger and got a veggie burger, with a side of cold vegetables.. the broccoli was all stalks and no heads.. my side came out on my dad's plate and his on mine. While the waitress was very pleasant, whoever is in the kitchen, clearly doesn't care about what they are serving. There's no question, we will never eat here again."}
{"text":"We were driving around looking for a place that would serve us a Saturday brunch at 2pm and gave up before coming here. I had already geared up for lunch, but was pleasantly surprised to see breakfast options on the menu.  The first thing our nice, friendly, patient waiter did was offer us their bloody mary/mimosa special.  $1.99 for a cocktail until 3pm!  I happily took the traditional bloody mary.  It was good.  In fact, I ended up with two by the end of the meal.  Nice and toasty for less than 4 bucks.  He had the big big blue drink. lol.  The bf had the huevos rancheros and it was a pretty good one.  Large, and could easily fill two people.  I had the tequila chicken omelette.  Yes, I could taste the shot of tequila!  Good, but I was wondering where my avocado went.  We saw someone's sweet potato casserole get carried by.  The oozing toasted marshmallows overflowing the dish convinced us that we had to have an order.  It surprisingly came quickly, and though my bf enjoyed it, I was disappointed by the powdery texture of the potatoes.  I ended up just picking off the toasted marshmallows. Those were good.  We also witnessed a giant heaping of nachos go by.  The stack could feed an army, luckily it was being shared by two people.  If you're looking for reliable dishes that come in generous portions at very very affordable prices, this is the place for you.  We were stuffed. (and almost hammered :))"}
{"text":"*I read the review that \"were not recommended\" by yelp on this place, after I posted my review\". Most of them are pretty dead-on as far as I'm concerned.  I need to get better about checking reviews BEFORE I go.*  Good for cheap happy hour beers, but that's probably about it. I didn't drink because I just came with my son to grab a bite. Will not be back for food.  My son (age 12) and I went to Shout House, but found it wasn't open on Tuesdays. So we walked around a bit and decided to give Saddle Ranch a try. The place was pretty empty, besides the bar. We got seated right next to the bar area. This worked out ok today, but I could see how it could be a bad idea with a rowdier crowd at the bar.   The server suggested the Monster appetizer because it was happy hour and 1/2 off. Comes with 4 wings, onion rings, 4 short ribs, 3 sliders, and sweet potato fries ($23.99 reg price, happy hour $12). My son liked the wings, I thought they were very salty. The onion rings were good, slider patties were burnt and incredibly dry, short ribs sauce was good but they seemed like they had been sitting....maybe overnight-dry and tasted rewarmed. Sweet potato fries were cold and just not good. Server did bring us another order of sliders, cooked better, but still flavorless. She did bring us a \"half baked choc chip cookie\" topped with ice cream as a \"special thanks for coming in today\"...not sure if that is just something they do or if it was because it was our first time there and weren't real pleased with our food.   Management must have been bored because he asked how we were doing 4-5 times during our 30/40 minute visit. The last time he came over, he stunk horribly of cigarette smoke (seriously like he had a lit one on him), not a great smell while you're trying to have a meal. On his 3rd visit to the table (after we had gotten our food) I did tell him about the sliders being very overcooked/dry and he said, \"Yeah, that happens with the mini's sometimes\" and walked away.  He got just past our table, turned around and THEN said, \"can I have them put another order in for you?\". I just felt he was very unprofessional.   I'll end by saying that the 1 star is because we had a pretty good server, not great, but decent. I don't think with as slow as it was that refilling a water glass should have been too much to handle.  She stood there and watched me pour some of my son's water into my glass and still didn't bother to come back with more water."}
{"text":"Well, what can you say about these giant places in the entertainment areas connected to stadiums and such?  Saddle Ranch had some really nice staff, and the drinks were totally reasonable considering the real estate they have here right next to the stadium.  Our group had a blast here before the BCS National Championship game (War Eagle!) and after as well.    Didn't eat anything and if you are looking for microbrews you won't find many but there's a ton of space here and the bathroom lines weren't bad considering it was totally packed all day and night!"}
{"text":"We stopped at the Saddle ranch on our way to the Paul McCartney concert, and while the lines were insane everywhere, it didn't take long to get a table.   I recommend hitting the outside bars while you wait, the drinks had a lot less ice, if you know what I'm saying....  The outdoor seating was a better choice too, once the sun went down behind a billboard that is!  I imagine it's a bit hot when the summer comes, but it was so much nice than the indoor mechanical bull scene... for dinner.  (I imagine the indoor bull/bar scene is a happening place to be on a Friday or Saturday night out!  Grab the girlfriends and dress in your best cowgirl gear!  Yeehaw!)  Now the food... Had the artichoke dip, wedge salad-YUM! but definitely share it unless you're only eating an ENTIRE head of lettuce for dinner,  and a filet.  While they didn't bring the steak out rare, as requested, it was very tasty.  Much tastier than I thought I'd be getting from the looks of the place.   (We did wait awhile for food, but totally expected to considering the entire city area was packed for the concert.)  But the best reason of all to drink, eat, and ride a bull (or a cowboy-as some of the shirts recommend) is that when it comes time to tinkle, as us ladies must do.... there are rows of stalls in the ladies room!!!  Ah, finally a place that understands the biggest need of women in bars!!  *I'm putting moderate, but it can easily be spendy if you're drinking."}
{"text":"Good place to hang out before a game at the stadium, but get there early if you want to eat at a table because it gets packed. The beers are big & cold, and I've always liked the crowd there before games. It's people who want to have fun but are relaxed, and a nice energy gets going before the game.   The menu is standard and I've only ever had the veggie burger here which is consistently good - two Gardenburger patties (a relief for vegetarians who don't want fake meat) piled with cheese and traditional toppings. The fries are good."}
{"text":"This our third visit from out of town. First was just after the opening during Super Bowl 42 Always good  Great service and food  Perfect melting pot to meet people"}
{"text":"Others are right. The food is ok at best and the service was horrible. If you are short on time, do yourself a favor and find another option. Won't be going back. It walked in at 1145 and place wasn't crowded at all. Seated right away. Half interested waitress finally came over at 1205 to take drink orders. It felt like we were bothering her. She was supposedly sick. Well if that is the case, why come to work and expose the rest of us??? Anyway, finally got drinks at 1215. Glad I wasn't dying of thirst. Took our order. Then apparently she finally goes home cause of sickness and we get another guy. He was nice enough. Kept checking on us but by 1250 and still no food I am about pissed. We ordered at 1215! Food comes at 1255 and is pretty much lukewarm. We finished what we could and then bailed. This place is definitely on the never return list. Apparently we weren't the only ones around that were upset. We saw a couple of tables complain. A quick lunch turned into a terrible adventure. Good luck with that business model. Beware."}
{"text":"Welcome to my worst dining experience ever with excellent service. Not even the waiter who worked his ass off could eliminate what a horrible dining experience I just got back from. Normally I let things sit for a bit before writing a review...   Tonight I am just too astoundingly pissed off to wait. My dining experienced SUCKED  Pro Tip: DO NOT COME HERE OR EAT HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE AN UNSATISFIED CUSTOMER.  First: We saw a cleared table outside which we were waiting to be seated and had stated we were waiting for an outside seat. Well after we waited and the table was cleared and set, at least 15-20 minutes when there was no wait inside (shoulda known something was amiss right here). We were informed surreptitiously that there wasnt a table available outside as it was for a reservation that hadnt yet arrived.  Second: We ordered our drinks and I was excited to get a liter of tea mixed with Vodka. Well if there was any Vodka in my drink, no one, I LITERALLY MEAN NO ONE, could taste or smell it. So I complained and asked for additional alcohol. $13.50 for a drink that is supposed to be a contain a good amount of alcohol, you think you could taste or smell it slightly right? Well yeah they said it was made properly and wouldnt do anything for me so the waiter got me a shot of vodka which i poured into my drink which guess what? it tasted like there was a hint of alcohol at that point.  Third: This was the worst ribeye i have ever gotten. I requested it to be medium. I do not know how, but they were able to cook the middle medium and half of one side was bloodier than extra rare and the other side was medium rare. I had to get A1 to give it some flavor. This is the first time I have had to ask for A1 in a steakhouse in over a year... *SMH* WTH is wrong with you )(*^&^$'s!  Other stuff: My friends who ordered chicken loved it. My friend who ordered the primerib felt his was as bad as mine and it was covered in lots and lots of fat! So much so that my other friends dog is eating great tonight...  The good things: The waiter who took our order was on point, but was hampered severely by the bartender and the kitchen staff. The mini muffins and biscuits were great. The honey butter was outstanding to go with them.   If you come here prepare to be disappointed or taken advantage of. I was completely and thoroughly unsatisfied with my entire meal. THERE IS NO REASON TO EAT HERE, so dont waste your money, time, or desire to have a good meal. You will likely leave here disappointed unless you order the chicken."}
{"text":"B-E-S-T Huevos Rancheros....big enough for TWO!  4 eggs...come on now!  Pair that with a $1.99 bloody mary or mimosa and well...enough said.  Atmosphere very fun...espeically on \"Sunday Funday\"....seems to be the growing trend between here and the Vig!  Great music, fun friendly staff!  Sweet potatoes are super duper yummy!  Definitely worth taking out of town guests to!!!"}
{"text":"we came here after a recommendation, and because we were in the area anyway.  we walked in around noon on a sunday. 6 in our group (4 kids)the place was pretty empty, so  we were promptly seated by the manager, and we told him we were in a rush, and we would just be getting a couple appetizers. He was very friendly, and told us he'd put in our order, and bring our sever to get our drinks. drinks took about 10 min to receive, and all it was, was simple water;we were also given some stale, and very dry mini biscuits, and even more dry, mini corn bread muffins. those came with a flavored butter, but it was hardly  noticed!! About 30 min of waiting for our apps, they finally came.....and they were pretty much room temp. we ordered the artichoke dip, and the big sample platter. The dip was around $15, and the sample platter was about $25. The dip came in a bread bowl, with chips. It wasn't bad if you like cold, solidified cheese over your dip which  was intended to be warm and melty. The sample platter had 4 little, dry, skimpy ribs, some onion rings,  sweet potatoe fries, a couple wings, and 4 tasty sliders. It also came with 4 dipping sauces. Definitely not worth $25!!!! service was terribly slow, and we will never be back!!!! I wish we would have ready reveiws before wasting our $$!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant with exceptional service and food!!! We like coming for happy hour and sharing monster platter. The cotton candy is a must...at least order it for a photo.... I think it tastes awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Came here hoping to have a great dinner . Pork chop .. place was virtually empty and the service was lousy . I did not order a beer and the waitress must have decided I was not a high paying customer . Ordered a salad and never got it . Vegetables were undercooked , hard and basically all squash.  After complaining about he service , she automatically assumed I wanted desert. Offered me a free desert without asking what I wanted ..  saddle up your horse and move on.. steer clear of this place ..ouch !"}
{"text":"I normally wouldn't waste my time reviewing a place but I need to inform people going here to never set foot in this place again. The only word I can think of to describe this place is NASTY. N-A-S-T-Y. Nasty. They told us it would be a 15 minute wait and it took 45 minutes for me, my friend, and her son to get a table. They had tables open inside and outside that weren't being used, and weren't being reserved. The hosts could have offered us ANY table and I would have been happy. We told the manager and she make some rude remark telling us it wasn't that long of a wait. Our server was boring, didn't smile, and was uneducated about the menu. She was probably just miserable working at this place because her poor attitude doesn't get her any tips. We ordered a side of fries and the Monster platter. The fries came out first and not even kidding... they tasted worse than McDonalds. You could just taste the nasty aftertaste of the oil that it probably was sitting in all day. The Monster platter came out and it was SCARY. The wings were SO dry that they could be labeled as beef jerky on the menu. The onion rings were battered, I mean battered with greasy, used up motor oil. Disgusting! The cheeseburgers were worse than the ones the I had at the cafeteria in high school. The buns were soooo dry that I think they could be compared to the hockey pucks from the Coyotes Stadium. I think the only thing I liked on that platter was carrots and celery. Not even the ranch and blue cheese was good! Oh- and the beer was good. That's it. I told the manager hey- it seems like our platter has been sitting out for a while. He said it was fresh, and he lied. I guarantee he lied. PLEASE, TO SAVE EVERYONE IN GLENDALE ARIZONA, CLOSE THIS PLACE DOWN!!! IN THE NAME OF JESUS, AMEN!"}
{"text":"First time i have ever had a card pre auth before they will enter your order. I normally dine at the higher end steak houses such as J&G so at the chop house they treat you like your some poor person that will not pay air bill. The two stars are for their food only. I will have this reviewed on open table also and it will be my last time back here"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Saddle Ranch but not this location. I got charged $25 for 2 drinks and I had to sit next to a dirty dish rag and a beer tower that had been tapped for at least an hour. Drinks were actually less expensive inside the stadium by $10. I think I'll stick to the one in Scottsdale and actually save money."}
{"text":"A loaded AMF while at bike night.  Excellent way to end a  Thursday"}
{"text":"It is a shame I can't give this place zero stars. They advertise to come celebrate Christmas with them and we did due to a change in family plans. Well celebrating with them means a limited menu as they consider Christmas an \"event\". Oh and.. They were out of nearly everything. Now let's talk about their Mac n cheese...   They used to have what I considered the best Mac n cheese ever, it was their truffle Mac n cheese, served in a large skillet oozing with creamy cheesy goodness. They changed the menu so now it is in a tiny skillet. I still hoped for the best and gave it a taste.. Well it is now spicy. Mind you I ordered the truffle one,not the jalapeno one. So we complained and were told that IS the truffle one. They use a \"queso\" cheese in all of their Mac n cheeses now. Translation? Less costly. I couldn't taste the truffle in it and other that some small chopped pieces that could have been regular mushrooms, there was no real evidence it was there.   Drinks. They used to have a pretty amazing Moscow mule. That's gone. They don't even carry ginger beer anymore to make it. Don't they know what the drink trends are right now?  Service.. I'll give the guy behind the bar a break in not serving is for the first 5ish or so minutes we sat there, he was new and in training. Our order was wrong numerous times. Even our bill came with someone else's food listed on it.   I'm heartbroken at how far down this place has plummeted to. It used to be pretty good service, great food and drinks. We will be spending our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very good food, great service, I believe our waitress's name was Johnny she was very professional. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for good steaks and BBQ! Of course price is a little high but not crazy high. It's the right price for great steaks and ribs. Tri tip and sausage was awesome!"}
{"text":"Came here for my boyfriend's sister's birthday. Let's just say she was drunk and wearing a dress and we (the girls not the brother, he turned his back) encouraged her to ride the mechanical bull. A good time was had by all. She rode it twice and the second time the picnic table cloth she was given didn't quite cover her up and everyone got a free show. She had a blast, a good laugh, and some free drinks!"}
{"text":"I brought out of town company here for dinner before we went to a hockey game. The fact that there was no wait should have been our first clue. The service was terrible! The appetizers (onion rings and buffalo wings) were stone cold. The BBQ chicken sandwich was okay, but one member of our party was served an entree salad with chicken, and waited for silverware until I finally got up and asked another server for some. Our server was MIA for a good bit and then finally showed up with silverware. Brain forewarned, there are no happy hour specials on a \"game night\". Will not be going back. Overpriced and poor quality/service."}
{"text":"Great experience at the  restaurant from start to finsh and our waitress Tayara was so attentive and friendly, cute as can be . Great great great . We will be back."}
{"text":"I recently visited the Saddle Ranch in Scottsdale with a group that was in town for a bachelor party. We had a great time and the server was 5 stars. My advice is to stay away from the Steaks and stick with entrees that are more in line with typical \"bar food\". My N.Y. Strip was tough as nails and I wish I had ordered something else. This place is a great atmosphere if you want to have a good time on the town."}
{"text":"If I could give it less stars I would.  Service was so slow.  We had to wait 10 minutes for a server to ask us our drink order, after that it was another 10 before our water came out, then another 10 for our cocktails.  Our food took another 30 and when it finally did come out, those of us that got our food ( two people had to wait an additional 5 minutes) it was cold and mediocre at best.  Our server showed no signs of a personality.  Save yourself the trouble and avoid this restaurant."}
{"text":"I love watching people make fools of themselves, so the mechanical bull is worth five stars alone on a busy night.  Even with the bull though, I used to hate this place.  I'm not sure why.  Oh wait, I probably hated this place because my friends dragged me here post break-up.  I wasn't in the mood to mingle and they forced me to play this game where I had to pick out how many guys I found attractive and I came up with zero. Seriously, zero.  I'm thinking I wasn't in the mood to accurately judge this place.   Anyway, I went back last Saturday night for dinner on the patio and actually enjoyed myself.  It was a pre-game stop, but still a lot of fun.  The staff is great.  While my friends and I sipped our drinks a guy came over with the largest thing of cotton candy I have ever seen.  He said it was on the house.  I thanked him, but was a little shocked and asked him why.  He said, \"Why not, cotton candy for three beautiful ladies.\"  The best part is that one of the beautiful ladies in my group was actually a man.  I laughed so hard I could barely contain myself.  I think it's time for my friend to cut his hair.   The people watching is incredible.  At 9 o'clock this girl was already completely wasted (some people really need to learn how to pace themselves) and got into a fight with a random guy.  She dumped her drink on him and had to be escorted out by the bouncer.  Part of me wishes girls would realize how bad behavior like this makes them look, but another part loves laughing at it too much.   Finally, the food was actually really good.  Crave worthy in fact.  I had the BBQ nachos and tried a \"little\" of my friend's macaroni.  My taste buds had an orgasm.  I was a bit embarrassed by how much I enjoyed it.  Whatever, creamy mac and cheese with jalapeno is worth it.  In fact, screw the bull, fun staff, and people watching.  I'll go back for the macaroni alone."}
{"text":"This restaurant is topically a nice place to eat,  listen to music and have some drinks. The food is great, The staff are nice.....But.....the service is way to slow. I was there for lunch. 2pm, not very busy. Just a few tables with guests and the bar had maybe 5 people. It took our server almost an hour to get our meal. I am not blaming the server because it comes from the kitchen. They need more cooks. This has happened numerous times."}
{"text":"Really bad service. not very great food. I had fish tacos which were alright but 2 others got burgers that were over cooked. Server took FORVER 10 minutes at the table before getting greeted another 10 minutes for drinks. When food came 2 people were missing their meals for 10 minutes. Just horrible experience. We Will never be back."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner. We may have been a bit over dressed but we enjoyed ourselves. The place is massive and we got our food quick. I had the bbq chicken rubbed rib combo and my girlfriend got the ribeye. She also had the spiked honey lemonade which was served in a giant carafe. The ribeye was cooked perfectly, the ribs were tender. Only issue is that the chicken was a little dry but still very enjoyable.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever had in my life! The server, Shelby, got our drink and food orders wrong, was rude and blamed us for getting the order incorrect!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time here.  Ordered Long Island ice tea wow you get a lot.  I had Prime Rib was perfect and hubby had ribs which were great.  You get lots of food no worry about leaving hungry.  Service was great and the atmosphere was outstanding. Would highly recommend this place anytime."}
{"text":"For lunch on a Friday, it is almost empty,  and the service was fine and friendly.   My classic BLT with added avocado was delicious and so large,  half is going home with me. The $3.49 mimosa was delicious., as were the sweet potato fries. Most of them will come home for dinner, too.   On nice days, the doors are open,  and the sparrows are opportunistic.  Be ready to chase them unless you want them in your plate."}
{"text":"Love their salads. A bit pricey. Fun party atmosphere at all of their locations in AZ. Make sure you wear pants so you can ride the bull before dinner! Great Cotten candy on your birthday!"}
{"text":"What originally made me come here was the show on VH1 about their one of their So Cal locations. I loved this place and will be returning as soon as I'm back from out of town. Hot bartenders, free shots, and a bull? It doesn't get much better than that. We sat at the bar and our server was awesome. He recommended his version of the jalapeño mac and cheese and it was one of the most amazing things I've ever eaten. We also were given two rounds of free shots which was pretty sweet. They tried to sucker me in to joining the bull riding competition but I didn't end up doing it. I also got a pink cowboy hat here, which was an exciting find. Dishes are a little on the expensive side, but like most people have already said, the portions are very large. I already can't wait to go back to have that mac and cheese again. Try it, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"After about a half a dozen visits to Saddle Ranch I continue to leave slightly unimpressed, but thoroughly entertained by amateur bull riding. Unlike the vHI1 reality show, the place is never packed and the patrons are not famous or beautiful, rather the crowd is typically bachelor (ette) type parties, and douche bags.  These \"type\" are typically wasted and prove to be quite the show during a bull ride, but not fun to co-exist with otherwise.  It's these losers that keep me from sticking around too long, not the bar itself or the staff.  In fact, the only eye candy in the place is the staff (For men and women), and unlike many Old Town bars, they are actually very friendly.  SR is almost always running drink specials, and I just recently found out about their brunch specials serving $1.99 mimosas and bloody mary's (Yes, I know where I have I been?).  My recommendation for SR is: it's a great place to stop in for drinks and cotton candy, especially when you have friends in town. It by no means represents AZ bars, but for some reason out-of-towners love to think we are all a bunch of bullriding rednecks!"}
{"text":"Food was sub par, waitress didn't seem like she wanted to be there, our whole party waited forever to get drinks and food, and to top it off, we waited for 15 minutes to get the checks settled. Won't go back."}
{"text":"First time at Saddle Ranch and I must say it was great! Our wait for a table wasnt long, we got a great table once we were sitting. The Manager came by and introduced himself to us, that is one of the first times that has happened to me. Our waiter Raymond was ahhhh-mazing. He brought us over shots and cotton candy on the house. he was just great. he got a great tip that night."}
{"text":"I dunno what it is .... maybe it's the fact they're SO over-priced or maybe it's the fact they are so over-priced and the food isn't better than Famous Dave's.  There are DEFINITELY better BBQ/steak options for the same or cheaper prices.  I currently live at the condos at Westgate but once I'm not living there anymore, I don't see myself ever coming back.  It's just not worth the money..... unless you're there for staff eye candy."}
{"text":"I had had the California wrap and fries and washed it all down with a couple raspberry ice tea's. The food was good, fires were golden brown and nice and hot. Service was good too, atmosphere was awesome. Looks like a place that would better on a Friday afternoon or Sat. It a huge place and very nice wood work inside. Monitors on the wall playing good rock and decent country videos. I had fun, nice place."}
{"text":"So many great places right in this area.  This place is a disappointment compared to most of them.  No wonder they sometimes give away random stuff to nice customers (we got cotton candy).  At least the service was good."}
{"text":"The best end to a tipsy night is.... Smores' by the fire pit!!!! Awesome addition to this country scene...."}
{"text":"Atmosphere - 4 stars as the mechanical bull was quite entertaining Service - 2.5 stars as they were not overly helpful with our big group event Food - 2 stars as it really was not very good"}
{"text":"Where shall I begin, the server came up right away, which is great. We got our food in this humongous plate. Wine in a plastic glass? Seriously? then all of a sudden she disappeared. We weren't asked if the food was great or anything which it was okay it wasn't all that. $27 for a little piece of steak, not worth it.  At least when it came time to get the check she was very attentive. Won't be back. By the way clean up your restrooms that's disgusting."}
{"text":"Waitress was terrific - but bought 3 drinks, had to buy doubles to get decent pour.   Charge was enough to buy 2 bottles with change left over.  DONT DRINK THE LIQUOR."}
{"text":"If less than 1 star was available, I would give it... Was in area from Mesa for Guns n Roses concert and checked out places to eat at Westgate - this place appeared on their website to have a diversified menu for us so we tried them... The menu we saw was no way the on on their site - so abbreviated in selections that choosing something was hard. Son picked a burger ( there were only 2 - not the vast selection on their posted menu) and I had ceasar salad with chicken... what could possibly go wrong?!? All I I know is at the concert later, we both spent too many times in the rest room - we ate and drank nothing else but water  - and this continues the entire next day...  Conclude what you will but, there is nothing else to say! Should have trusted my instinct and after seeing the menu was not what I expected, and left - I got way more than I payed for... if I charged the meal, I would have disputed the charge, but paid cash...!"}
{"text":"It's dirty... it's loud... it's noisy... the drinks are massive... it has a mechanical bull where people can make complete fools of themselves after drinking too much... and it's jam packed with people.  I love it. :-D  I don't often go out to bars like these these days... I've kinda grown out of it, but every now and then I get an urge to just get out there and have a total sensory overload and now that I've been here... this is where I'll go next time. :)"}
{"text":"Worst Saddle Ranch i have ever been to Beware of this place. Horrible management. watch out for your credit card as well. I ordered food and drinks through one of the bartenders over the weekend for my clients and when i went to cash out she told me that she gave my tab to the waiter that was servicing my clients table without acknowledging me first. so instead of my normal bill of $120.00 they charged my card for over $375.00 for the tab. the Manager said I'm sorry this is illegal and should have never happened but wouldn't do anything about it to reverse the charges that weren't mine he asked me if he could buy me a drink instead. worst management and service ever. last time i will ever step foot in this place. I would highly recommend the Whiskey Rose across the Street or Mcfadden Bar."}
{"text":"The staff was very nice. The nachos are amazing. We ordered fish tacos, they were horrible. The fish was over cooked and the tortillas were hard. My husband ordered chicken with gravy and eggs, the biscuits were hard as a rock, eggs over cooked, little to no gravy. Bloody Mary's were ok. Again the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Misty was the best server ever!!!!! Great service, great hospitality, great atmosphere. Came here as tourists and highly recommend to anyone visiting. Bull riding and great drinks. Great time guaranteed."}
{"text":"Wonderful service! We came in with a large group which I know can be hectic on a server. Tyra was incredibly accommodating and so nice!"}
{"text":"I love Saddle Ranch for its casual night time festivities (including watching people ride the mechanical bull hehehe), but I cannot ignore the fact that the food was disgusting!  When I think of my meal this past Friday night, I think of two words: dry and cold. The spinach artichoke dip was just okay - a bit on the dry side and not very cheesy. The onion rings were just okay was well as the batter reminded me of the chicken nuggets at McDonald's, maybe even worse. The BBQ burger (turkey patty) was dry and tasteless as was the bacon. Really? It must take true talent to cook bacon tasteless. There are a few things that the menu has going for itself - a few very unique and fun desserts and drinks that I have yet to see elsewhere. I am fond of the giant pile of cotton candy and, though I'm not much of a beer drinker, the beer tower looks pretty badass.  For me, I came and will continue to come for the fun atmosphere, but I will definitely be staying away from the grub. Adios, cowboy."}
{"text":"When I first saw this place I was little like ummm we are really going in there? But I am so glad we did! Most of the bars were really crowded except for one in the corner where no one was. Me and my friends went over and the super friendly bartender was more then happy to serve us. She gave us some great deals. The first was that she gave me a 2 for 1 on my rum and coke (2 shots for the price of 1). She then offered to give us free shots if we bough a bandanna. (There was some sort of contest and her boss told her she needed to up her numbers.) My friend got a bandanna and we all come some delicious shots.  We then all took a turn riding the bull which was such a blast. Sadly I was too tipsy to be much good, but it was still fun none the less. Even if you sucked the crowd was on your side.  As we were getting ready to leave I had to have a bandanna of my own. I went back to my favorite bartender and she offered up another round of shots for my bandanna. Free shots, fun bandannas, and a mechanical bull. What else do you need?"}
{"text":"$1.99 mimosas...that's right. $1.99 mimosas and Bloody Marys.  What a way to finish the morning after the Run for Literacy.  We headed over, and while it wasn't 11 am yet, they said we could order off of the breakfast or lunch menu.  The mimosas and marys were good - my brother didn't think the \"Death Valley\" was hot enough, but he's pretty weird.  I got a sweet & sour mimosa, champagne, cranberry juice and champagne, and it was wonderful.  Then came the food.  Our group split about even between breakfast and lunch, and the portions were huge.  While nothing on the plate made me weep for joy, everything was a nice and tasty.  My sliders were probably the smallest portion, which was good, I could barely finish what I got.  Several people in our group needed boxes to take their leftovers.  Service was a wee bit slow at times, but I am betting the management wasn't paying attention to the events, and didn't think they'd get a post 5k rush - listen up management, when Mandi wants a mimosa, she wants it NOW!  If they weren't so far away from me, I'd head back tonight to try out the steak, but that will have to wait for the next time I'm on the West side."}
{"text":"The servers here are good, but the food is awful.  The only thing that was good were the ribs.  Soggy onion rings, weird sauces, burnt wings.  Not coming again."}
{"text":"I would give no stars if I could. The worst old fashioned cocktail I have ever had. The ribeye had grizzle. My wife ordered a French dip with no au jus. So basically a steak sandwich. I would not recommend saddle mountain for any reason. On a positive note service was OK."}
{"text":"I wish I could give them 0 stars. We wait a few minutes before the hostess seats us which is OK but then we sit down they tell us our server will be right with us and we continue to wait approximately 20 minutes. No one ever came to take our drink or food order so we eventually left. This was a Thursday evening so it was not a busy night, so in my opinion there was no reason for this treatment."}
{"text":"Great service, atmosphere and food. I ordered the fried chicken breast, it was moist and crispy with a delicious sauce. The vegetable side was cooked perfectly. Our server Ty was awesome."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I'm glad these reviews before mine didn't stop me from meeting a friend at this location. My experience was great from the moment I arrived, we were promptly greeted and seated.  Paula, our waitress was very friendly and prompt. Our orders came out in a timely manner. My friend had the salmon which she said was delicious (it looked yummy!) In ordered the classic turkey burger with sweet potato fries. It was amazing with the marshmallow sauce. Only critique is that my bun was way smaller than the turkey patty, so it got messy haha. Maybe management has been reading these reviews and making changes...or people just love to be negative. My experience was great. I will certainly return, maybe for happy hour next time."}
{"text":"They have a LOT of choices on the menu, but if they can't even wash the lettuce right for the lettuce wraps I shudder to think what ends up in their burgers.  All in all, mediocre food and not worth forming a clod of dirt in your intestines."}
{"text":"This establishment looks cool -- kind of a western themed Hooters, but with a much larger menu. And, I've actually had a pretty good burger served here. However, the place has such problems with service. These problems are so aggravating that I wouldn't even waste time going to this restaurant. It might be OK for a beer on the patio during Happy Hour, but steer clear of expectations of having no problems with your bill, or the food served properly, etc. I went in with a coupon that was clearly valid and that I had paid for. They refused to accept it because it was electronic (my phone, the coupon company says that you don't need to print them out) and not on paper . . . \"We're not very sophisticated here,\" said the manager. That is an understatement."}
{"text":"So unimpressed.  Restaurant was FREEZING inside & our server was much more worried about the tables of young guys than she was with getting our order.  We ordered burgers & chicken strips.  Chicken strips tasted like frozen Tyson strips. Burger was way over done. Never came to check on us & just dropped off the check.  Food was WAY overpriced for what it was. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've come to Saddle Ranch primarily as a bar, but have eaten there once or twice as well. I prefer it to other bars in the area because of the overall atmosphere.  It's a bit more laid back and less pretentious than McFadden's tries to be.  Never a cover charge (a plus in my book), and watching fools on the mechanical bull is always good for a few laughs.  A few weeks back in particular we went to the bar in the back just as the bartender was shutting that station down, but she went out of her way to make us all one last drink before she completely closed up shop.  A little customer service like that goes a long way!  As far as food goes I remember is being ok for the most part, aside from the sweet potato fries which were great with the side of cinnamon, marshmallow-ish dip (just try it, it's good)."}
{"text":"I can definitely understand the low reviews of this restaurant. The mediocre food, overpriced and poor quality at most is not something that will bring me back. Coffee was filled with grounds, scrambled hard eggs were runny, sausage was over cooked and dry ... just name a few low lights of brunch.   We had 2 servers and still had to ask for water refills.  Sugar for coffee, salt .. minimal things yes ... but make a big difference because while waiting, the food gets cold.  Perhaps better attention is provided to those who partake in the alcoholic choices, as a family, we felt overlooked."}
{"text":"Anyone from management care to explain why when your restaurant turns into a bar a night that I can't order a AMF? I don't want your bullshit pre made mixed drinks....and don't give me the lame excuse \"Someone died because of the mix in the drinks\" that sounds like a personal problem to me....won't go back until yall make drinks to order not what u have on your menu ...just another reason to avoid Westgate all together I'd say in 5 years it's a ghost town"}
{"text":"Never coming back, bad servers, waited for an hour for our food.. when the brought it they didn't give us silverware.. On top of that, everything was expensive"}
{"text":"Melissa and Jesse rocked it! Jesse for a new server we liked the service! We loved our food and our cotton candy! Ty for a nice family evening with great customer service! Ty for checking on us regularly!"}
{"text":"Came in with party of 20 before the a cardinals game. When we arrived it wasn't packed yet. However, the manager on duty made it seem like it was impossible to accommodate us. Luckily she had a hostess on duty who actually cared about the customers and was able to make it work. Managers attitude was horrible every time I witnessed it. Yelling in her mouthpiece to employees in front of customers. I would give this place 1 star for the manager alone. But the hostess was great and our waitress Amanda was on top of it,even when it did get extremely busy."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was for drinks around 11:30 on a Saturday night.  It was very crowded and Scottsdale-y, and I didn't care if ever went back.  Recently some out-of-towners wanted to check it out because of the mechanical bull, so we started out our evening by eating dinner there around 9:00 on Saturday night.  I have to say, it was better than I expected.  Some of the positives:    - The menu is huge and varied.   - You get to choose a side dish to go with the sandwiches.   - A smaller portion is offered for some of the dishes.   - Complimentary biscuits and corn muffins.  They didn't exactly taste homemade, but they weren't bad and kind of added to the Saddle Ranch theme. - We got free shots 'from the owner' which the waitress brought over with our drinks.  Mind you, the shot started with a B and had whipped cream on top (you get the idea), but it tasted pretty good.  Free anything is always well-received.    I ordered the barbecue chicken sandwich and chose the sweet potato casserole sans marshmallows as my side dish.  The sandwich was just okay -- the barbecue sauce was pretty bland and the \"sourdough\" bun tasted like white bread.  The sweet potato casserole was delicious.  My friend's quesadilla was pretty good.  Our other friend seemed to enjoy her turkey burger.  All in all this was not a bad pre-game locale.  And in case you're wondering, the two out-of-town guests somehow managed to stay on the mechanical bull."}
{"text":"Service sucks, food is WAY overpriced, no taste whatsoever... birds flying around all over, extremely unsanitary... this place has so much potential but they do nothing to help it.... steer clear"}
{"text":"Alright it was a night of a concert so there were more people than usual with that said we checked in at 5:20 and were told we be called in about 25 minutes after waiting 50 minutes we checked on our status after a while we were told 5 minutes more a half hour later we were sat.  We waited 5 minutes for our over worked server and we knew our order and gave it to her and she took 10 minutes to bring our water and a beer.  31 minutes we received our two appetizer over cooked n cold hot wings.  All for $35 total waste of money the server tried to keep up"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place. Menus needed to be wiped down, table was dirty & sticky. Area in the booth area was dirty too. Bar area had that mildew standing water smell. Ordered the Fried Chicken & Biscuit. Fried chicken was crispy but tasteless. I think they forgot to season the chicken prior to adding the breading. Biscuit was a let down, not light & fluffy like a biscuit should be. It was dense. The bacon gravy had a hint of bacon, but that was it. The dish is considered a signature dish, I expected better. Great place for large parties & if someone if looking for some extra fun, they can try riding the mechanical bull. Wait staff very friendly."}
{"text":"My wife and I were craving a steak and decided on Saddle Ranch. Ribeye steaks were cooked to perfection mine medium hers medium rare. They were seared perfectly. The manager met us at the door as we were leaving and asked us \"how was everything ?\" My wife told her that we never got to try the jalapeño corn bread. The manager told us to wait and she went and brought us a big box full with honey and butter. Great way to end a great meal..."}
{"text":"If Yelp would allow, I would rate a -1 star rating.  It started with a very incompetent Shift Mngr by the name of Johnnie.  Totally took order wrong.  When food service delivered she definitely gave attitude when I explained what was wrong.  Even though I explained what was wrong she still insisted to provide replacement which I rejected.  Guess what, she still had someone deliver anyway.  She never once apologized?  She did end up giving credit for multiple items but that was not my priority when explaining to her her screw ups.  Ownership at this restaurant ought to look for a different person to fill this evening shift manager position.  Additionally, drinks sub par, food was not very good, only redeeming aspect is that we had a good primary waitress!  I would avoid this establishment as there are other much better restaurants in this complex.  Sorry for the comments but you need to be trained on proper customer service."}
{"text":"We stopped here for drinks and an appetizer on a Saturday afternoon. It was not busy. I hate leaving negative reviews, but I can safely say that was the worst dining experience I've had in many years. The first thing I noticed was the glasses were dirty and covered in water spots. The cornbread they brought out as a starter was dry and flavorless. I ordered one of their specialty drinks to share and the first one came out in a dirty carafe with a bug in it. The second one came out about 15 minutes later and after it was gone, we noticed how dirty that carafe was! So gross.  We ordered their appetizer variety plate. It took a good 30 minutes for this to arrive. The rolls for the sliders were hard and dry.The ribs had some very spicy sauce on them which I did not enjoy, but others might. The wings were ok per my husband. The sweet potato fries and onion rings were fine. No silverware, salt, pepper or ketchup on the table or brought out. The waitress double charged us for the drink we sent back due to the bug. I was very disappointed in our experience here, and not only did we pay about $50 for bad food, a Soda and one drink, we all had upset stomachs all night. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"This place is a great place to stop by after work and have a few drinks!! The interior is setup like a country western bar....and it looks even better at night when the lights are dim, you've had a few drinks and the entertainment shifts to the mechanical bull....suddenly its a scene out of Caoyote Ugly!! The people behind the bar are there to also have some FUN!!"}
{"text":"This place is really good for happy hour. Best prices and food is always good I will be back. The bar person makes the best drinks and very friendly. You must order the monsters platter 1/2 price on happy hour."}
{"text":"Pros: Loud Crowd Good Food Semi-Decent drink prices Bull Hot Staff  Cons: Not my type of wanna-be rockstar crowd."}
{"text":"The decor is really fun, over the top old west. We were passing through on a Sunday around noon. The place was nearly empty and we were seated right away. After that, the service was slow, even though there were so few patrons. The food is really just so-so for such an expensive lunch. Specifically the French dip is definitely a pass. Dry meat and flavorless au jus. If I happened to be close by, I might stop in again but with several other choices literally beside the restaurant, probably not."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this place 3 stars is because our waiter, Derek was fantastic. Excellent customer service and attention.   Other than that the food was basic, boring and dry. The jalapeño bread was pretty good and so were thee nachos. But, I ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich and my boyfriend ordered the steak sandwich. Both were dry, without flavor and disappointing. Most likely I will never come back.   Thanks to Derek for being such a great waiter!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Dan the manager should be working at McDonald's not at this place. Ordered a beer and decided not to stay because the place was filthy and the bartender looked like he never washed his hands in weeks. We decided to leave before the beer got there and the bar tender and dan followed us outside and pretty much yelled at us. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Not to mention the place was filthy."}
{"text":"Awesome service!  After the eagles cardinals game we hit this spot for dinner and drinks and the hostess, server, food and drinks were nothing short of awesome.   Only down side was we ate outside and they allow smoking on their patio. We did have to ask some smokers to move away from our table."}
{"text":"Very family friendly for the dinner hours. We had little ones and the atmosphere was great for them. And service was fantastic, our waiter was so kind and knowledgeable. Get the smores to roast yourself for dessert!"}
{"text":"Had to ask Manager and other servers for stuff, refills, condiments, silverware, etc. We ordered tea, steak, and fries with our meals. Server didn't bring sugar, steaksauce, or ketchup. Steak sauce cap looked nasty and dried on the cap, sugar in sugar daddy was hard and caddy was dirty. Didn't use the pepper because the top was nasty as well. Go to Yard House nearby!! Clean and friendly place, it never disappoints!!"}
{"text":"I came here for a work event. This place almost defies description, but I will do my best. The atmosphere is a really weird blend of Carnival meets rodeo, swallowed by a steakhouse.   Somehow when I walked in, I missed that they have mechanical bull. Then I was sitting with my co-workers when alarms went off and people were yelling, and some rocket scientist was riding a mechanical bull. Lol It was very entertaining.   Drinks are ok. They serve wine in these weird plasticy unbreakable wine glasses, which seems suitable considering the mechanical bull, however I really dislike drinking wine from plastic.  I ordered fish tacos which were delicious and sampled some yummy ribs on the appetizer plate. Afterward, they brought us a giant martini glass with freshly made cotton candy. yum.   I will definitely come back, but bringing my husband with me next time."}
{"text":"Well, we decided to try Saddle Ranch again. Amy, our server, was the only good thing. Imagine being greeted by two hostesses who have nose rings the size of what a bull has.  just nasty   The mashed potatoes were cold and gummy.  The monster app-everything was cold.  The chicken wings were bloody.  The sliders were not edible, they were so hard.  The waitress brought us another one.  Seriously, it was no better.  disgusting The manager came over.  She had this taken off the bill.  Amy did give us a complimentary dessert which was awesome. The sugar holder was splashed with dried food.  The salt and pepper shakers were sticky.  Ok   You got a second chance and there will be no more.  They don't deserve any stars."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for an early Friday night. My wife & daughter's  had a great time & the food was sufficient. Cool adult place for later."}
{"text":"Zero stars.  Of all the places in LA to expand it had to be this hellhole.  Awful people, awful atmosphere, and probably the most arrogant bartender I've ever encountered.  And that's really saying something."}
{"text":"Allajah was the best server I've ever had! I've been to thousands of restaurants and she was attentive, visits were spaced appropriately,  and was an overall friendly and excellent server! Have been here lots of times, but by FAR the best service I've ever had. Would recommend restaurant around lunch time for sure!"}
{"text":"Fun lunch! The place wasn't too busy for our first time here and the waitress, Amanda was wonderful...very attentive...came back several times for drink refils and to make sure we were good! Food portions were huge...and the Monster Platter was everything it implies and  really delicious. We also had the chicken tacos which we also enjoyed. The management stopped by our table to make sure we were good and the busboy was on top of clearing off used dishes. Kudos to the entire staff!"}
{"text":"Awesome time for my girlfriends 21st B-Day! Had no problems at all. We just walked in, they let us sit where ever we wanted, and they had a waitress there in no time.   Since my girlfriend just turned 21 she asked what a good drink would be, the waitress (also training someone at the time!) was quick to ask questions about what she liked flavor wise and had suggestions right away. We took the suggestion and my girlfriend absolutely loved the drink!   They were leaving us alone, but still walking by just to make sure we didn't need more and what not, and they were great! After we got our bill the waitress walked over one more time with free shots on the house to celebrate her b-day! Of all places they were the first to offer a free drink!   Food was great, and everything is half price during happy hour! Even drinks! Everything was mixed well, and the place is really fun when it gets packed! It's huge and really open, so even with a lot of people inside it never feels stuffy or uncomfortable at all. They have one really large main bar, then a smaller one off to the side as well.   The manager even went out of her way to come say hi to us which was really great!   We are for sure going to try and become regulars at this place!"}
{"text":"Second visit. Hoping for a better experience than our first. Took forever to get a serve, then too long to show up with the drinks. Then she disappeared. Had to hale another server to get her back to take our food order. (One of my pet peeves is an empty drink and at their prices this should never be an issue) Drinks were ordered but went empty on the long wait for the food. 25 minutes is a long time for a $13 burger and a $19 steak sandwich. Steak was really small, grissily and tough. Huge plate with 80% fries made it look like a slider, not a sandwich. Burger was better but pretty much the same. 3 tall draft beers, a steak sandwich and a burger and tip $86. We're done... sound of microphone dropping  PS Padre Murphy's Blackened Prime Rib sandwich for $15 is the BOMB, just sayin"}
{"text":"I can not believe how amazing and kind the bussing staff are at this specific location. My best friend tore her ACL at a neighboring restaurant and we were sitting outside on a green bench, near where they dispose all of the restaurants trash. They saw my friend crying and immediately ran out to get ice and tape to let me tape her up until I could get her to the hospital. We have been to saddle ranch previously, but never had the opportunity to meet the back of the house staff. These men helped me scoop her into my car so I could take her to the ER immediately. I wish I had asked their names but unfortunately didn't think of it at the time. I feel like management should definitely give them a big thumbs up and some kind of recognition. I am so thankful for these two!   This food is also amazing! Like I said we come here often. They have a huge menu, with all types, so that everyone can find something delicious to eat. The front of house staff is prompt and fun! The ambiance is great! I would say it's totally kid friendly during lunch! I can definitely say Sat./Fri. is so much fun!"}
{"text":"This was only the second time I had been to this establishment. The first time I was there it was great! But tonight was the absolute worst service I have ever received. It took an hour for us to just get our drinks from the bar. Then when our food finally came out a half hour after our drinks mine and my sisters steaks were over cooked. We had to send them back. This was one of the worst experiences I've ever had. We will not be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get breakfast on a Sunday before a football game. The service is fast the bartender was helpful. I wish Baton Rouge had this restaurant."}
{"text":"Felt a bit like a number here, definetely the meat market restaurant - in more ways than one.  From the hostess to the bartender - very hot place to be - fun to watch the bull riding but the food was as follows:  Chicken wings - had better - bit dry.  My prime rib was way underdone - had it been medium rare - perhaps my whole review would have been better.  The fries were excellent - not sure what they did to them - the rolls were - uh - bread.  The drinks we nothing spectacular - got a gin and tonic without a lime, thats one star deduct right there!  - Can't comment on the breakfast, would probably go back just to watch people get thrown off the bull - and stick with bottled beer."}
{"text":"Nice place to stop in before going into the arena.  Had an \"Original Burger\" and it WAS awesome!!  I say WAS because it was soo good I ate it all.  Comes on a nice big silver platter with tons of fries.  The $3.79 bloody mary don't hurt either."}
{"text":"Bland is the best description of the food here. Every dish needed a serious dash of salt. We ordered the Nachos appetizer with added chicken; bland and sadly, it was the best part of our meal.  My wife ordered the burger with garlic mashed potatoes. The burger was overly greasy and the mashed potatoes tasted like they were cooked with garlic flavorings; very unimpressive.  I had the Two Steak Tacos. How can tacos be bland? Added salt to bring some flavor out. The steak pieces were a bit chewy. In lieu of rice I had fries. Again, no salt on the fries.  The piece de resistance. I asked for water with my meal. It tasted like it was drawn from a hose in someone's backyard. While not the best, it was still drinkable. However, the refill was absolutely gross. They have pitchers lying around to refill waters and maybe iced teas. I saw our server use one to fill my water. I took a swig, at first taste I thought he gave me soda water it was so bitter. A second swig confirmed to me that it wasn't soda water and that it just tasted plain awful. It makes you wonder how does water go bad. Then you see the little birds flying in and out of the place and it makes you wonder if it had some bird flavorings added, if you get my drift. I am surprised the health dept doesn't have a say about that.  All in all, if you are on a low salt diet, anything on the menu is ok to eat because they don't appear to put salt on anything.  Will I be back? No. For price you pay, you get cheap thin chintzy napkins, crappy water, and bland food. Save your money and hit any of the other locations, there are plenty to choose from."}
{"text":"Went there last night for Bike Night. Our server was lovely. I ordered a glass of Chardonnay. I had one glass of wine and asked for my tab. They charged me $18.95 for one 5oz glass of wine. Don't know if the jack up the price for events or not. Next time I'll stay home, I can get an entire bottle at the store for $7.00."}
{"text":"I tried this place along time ago, way before Yelp. It doesn't look like customer service wise anything is changed.   When you come out of the arena there's a bunch of girls rolling around with a bucket giving away free bull ride passes to sucker you in. We walked in and the place was about 50/50 empty/full. So of course we tried to sit where the bull was because we were dumb enough to pick up 2 bull riding \"free\" tickets. Guess what, you can't sit there because those spots are reserved even though nobody has it reserved for the night. Ok, well let's just grab a normal table then. Nope, we have to put our name on the list and wait for one of the empty tables to come up. We sit down and wait for about 15 minutes looking at empty tables and we come to the realization that this place sucks so we get up and we walk out. Guess what, we never got buzzed for a seat. We did get informed that we are on the waiting list but that's it. Way to go restaurant! Guess I should've read all the poor reviews before I bothered wasting my time."}
{"text":"ZERO STARS ACTUALLY! Horrible!  Over priced, not the best menu and terrible service.  DON'T waste your money or time!"}
{"text":"I would never eat here again. The waiter was great and it was nice atmosphere to seat outside. But besides that It took about 45 mins to get our food. It was not good, but it took so long to come that nobody wanted to send anything back. I ordered a veggie omelet, it was a plain omelet with the vegetables folded in the middle after it was cooked. The avocado on the top was warm and old, the hash browns were like fried mashed potatoes, my strawberry blonde mimosa was like drinking strawberry syrup, thick, sweet n no alcohol.  Maybe they are better for lunch or dinner but not for breakfast, Denny's would have been better."}
{"text":"I took my family last night we had a great time... the food was awesome the people were great and the assistant general manager Julie Hardy was super nice came to our table multi times took my kids and made Smore's with them on a fire pit , brought us the biggest cotton candy we have ever seen ... Everybody had a great time"}
{"text":"Showed up after the football game, it's 6:00pm and they took forever to serve us drinks (actually never came before we decided to leave), wanted a salad with no onions but that was a modification they wouldn't allow during a post-game rush, and the kicker... OUT OF BAKED POTATOES at a steak house! Nothing about this place justifies the pricing except having the steak house aspect cornered in this Westgate Entertainment area. My advice if you're here during the NFL season, skip this place and go elsewhere since there is so much to choose from!"}
{"text":"I was pretty faded by the time we made it over here. But I'll try to review what I remember. Me, & 2 of my friends were here on a Tue around midnight. Not too crowded but still a decent turn out.  We walked in & 1 of the cute male bartenders was doing tricks with a couple vodka bottles. He was even breathing fire.  I didn't ride the bull. I didn't feel like upchucking that night. But it was kind of fun to watch others & cheer on strangers.  There's karaoke. I know this because my friend actually managed to get me to sing a song. I must have been really fing drunk.  Ok, so why 2 stars? Because 1 of the bartenders took our vodka tonics away before we were even 1/2 way done with them. So what that we're drunk. So what that we turn around & watch people on the bull. So what that we don't hover over our drinks. Until that damn glass is empty don't touch my drink bitches."}
{"text":"I came in with my sorority sisters and they had put boards on top of the pool table, which was really uncomfortable. It wasn't really packed but it took forever to get our food (an hour). I felt real bad for our server due to her just training and nobody really helping her. The food was cold... The fries weren't as good. When asked to speak with the manager in stead the waiter got security."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service! It was our first time going, Kyle was our server he was the best server ever! He explained the menu brought us everything we needed and brought us cotton candy on the house! Loved this place, great atmosphere, awesome people and tasty food! This is our new hangout when in town for Spring Training!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Most importantly, quality of service was amazing. Kaley, our server was super attentive, great personality, not just to us but every table she was serving. Our drinks were refilled and never saw the bottom of the glass. She made sure our order of food was to our satisfaction. Checked on our table periodically. Great service!!! Ask for kaley when you go there."}
{"text":"Stopped in to eat after attending the Home and Garden show. We did not know what to expect, but were pleasantly surprised. It was the middle of the afternoon, so I did not want a heavy meal and ordered one of their hamburgers. I have had a million burgers in my day and I have to say this was one of the best! As good as the burger was, I can only imagine what one of their signature items might be like. I will definatly go back if I am in the area again."}
{"text":"Saddle Ranch has a great bar atmosphere. Customer service is average but there's nothing really much to do here other than the bull ride. Wish there was more..."}
{"text":"Had a $2 bloody mary here. It tasted like $2.  I love bloody marys with a kick and mine definitely had one.They just need to tone down the olive juice or whatever was causing that rubbery sour flavor. I like their decor, ambiance, and friendly service. I'll give them another try, maybe their mimosas will be better."}
{"text":"Food was ok, service was not so good. Party of 8 all of us received our food over the course of 1/2 hour. They can't even get 8 peoples food out at same time????? Not that large of a party :/"}
{"text":"Positive:   I have eat here on a number of occasions and they prepare a very good juicy stake, the ribeye, new york and cowboy stakes are very good but the Porterhouse is to die for, bring a healthy appetite because these stakes are thick and huge, of course they come with the extras like potato (a few different ways) and greens, you can as well pick from a verity of other choices to be served with the stake.  The servers are very polite and make you feel right at home, there is a full bar as well and if your feeling courageous they have a mechanical bull where all can watch the lucky or unlucky riders..lol  Negative:   The parking - They have valet parking for around $5.00 but no open parking lot so if you choose to park yourself its going to be on the street somewhere?"}
{"text":"Always a fun time. Food is good, drinks are good, and THEY HAVE COTTON CANDY, along with a mechanical bull (which is on my list to-do). This place is really good for large groups and the crowd is very diverse in age, which I enjoy. I've never been here during the day time, just late dinner and drinks time, but I still highly recommend it! All the staff is friendly and seem to enjoy their job which kinda makes you have a better time since they are all joking around and laughing."}
{"text":"Went here before the Coyotes game. Food is horrible!!! I mean horrible!!!  We (3 of us) had the \"steak sandwich\" which was barely edible. Parts you couldn't even chew threw it. Our server was nice and gave decent service.  Don't eat here, just grab a drink."}
{"text":"Saddle Ranch does a phenomenal job at making customers feel unwelcome.  They advertise the best happy hour in town yet they don't honor it if there is a sporting even going on. We have been here a number of times. The food is good but doesn't justify the price. The service has been marginal at best. Thanks but no thanks we won't be going back."}
{"text":"The server's they hire here are space cadets. The first time I ate at Saddle Ranch for brunch I ordered a bloody mary and  the waitress said \" I'm like soo sorry we totally ran out of bloody mary mix\" so I ordered a mimosa. I finish my mimosa and a few minutes later I see someone drinking a bloody mary! I asked the waitress about it and she says \"Oh ya we have it now\" I was speechless that she didn't mention it to me I think a good server would have mentioned that if I asked for it in the first place.  Everytime I come to Saddle Ranch the waitresses fail to pay attention to detail like refilling your drinks, making sure you have utensils, and if you ask for something you'll probably end up getting it when they deliver your bill. I am a sucker for cheap brunch so I will continue eating here on Sundays for the yummy mimosas and biscuits with apple butter mmmmm."}
{"text":"I love Saddle Ranch for the fun atmosphere. I really like the food and the people who work here are so much fun! I I came here for brunch on the 4th of July and the waiter was pretty honest about being hungover and made us laugh the whole time we were there. He gave me the biggest mimosa I have ever had and gave me and my friends a free shot. The brunch specials are awesome their mimosas and bloody mary's are only $1.99 and you can choose different variations of the classic drinks. I always leave Saddle Ranch with a smile on my face."}
{"text":"Place was OK, the girls and service were great! We were there during the day when its very slow. We all shared a appetizer plate, witch was huge. The mini burgers weren't that good, but the ribs were awesome! And never had the sweet potato fries with marshmallow dip? Wow what a surprise!!! Overall its OK, I probably will not try this place when they are busy. It'll be just like their Universal City location with a bunch of fake A$$ cowboys and cowgirls!"}
{"text":"Overview: Great place for a weekday night.  Time Attended: Weekday Lunch   Environment: Southern Themed.  Very Open. Door and Windows open. Lots of Patio Space.  Price: Average. Drinks can be pricey but only because the \"Cocktail\" menu offers Double Sized drinks.  Food Ordered:  - Angry Orchard: available on tap - Mimosa: Pretty Good - Huevos Rancheros: Excellent. LARGE Portion - French Dip: Came on Soft Ciabatta bread with au jus and creamy mashed potatoes. (Your choice of side)  Parking: Always Available When I Went.  Staff: The server we had was extremely polite.  We took a long time deciding on a meal and she was more than friendly about giving us more time without ignoring us for 20 minutes before returning.  Recommendation: Their Spinach and Cheese dip is served with tortilla chips in a bread bowl.   Very good and very filling  Other: Only comment would be that there were a few gnats hanging over our food but I don't honestly blame Saddle Ranch for that.  It's hot and the doors are open for a breeze.  Not much to be done."}
{"text":"FINALLY!.... ive returned back to Saddle Ranch after a year. And since I popped my Yelp cherry (can I say that on here?) on the Messagewerx review. Figured I might as well make this my 2nd. Ive always liked the decor in Saddle Ranch it fits in with the whole wild west of AZ. and its very open and spacious. We was greeted and seated as soon as we walked in, u never really have to wait for that there. I recommend the sweet tea lemonade alcoholic drink. Our waiter Bryan recommended it to me and my girl and it hit the spot. My girl sucked down the first one and quickly ordered another. She ordered the Cobb salad which is huge and I got the Cali Chicken Wrap with Sweet Potato fries. Both were pretty good.  The prices were a bit steep for some of the things. For instance those drinks were about $14 a pop I believe but I think we were there during Happy Hour. The food wasn't anything that knocks you off your feet, but its not bad by any means. If u hit up Westgate its probably the best place to go cause they always bring a good crowd in the evening hours. Ill probably be back there before another year has passed. I didn't ride the mechanical bull this time. That's reason enough to go back. And make sure u get Bryan with a \"y\" as your waiter. He was fast, came by at just the right times to ask how everything was, had good drink recommendations, and had just a overall good attitude."}
{"text":"Man... The times I have in here and the many times I've come in here.  Byron the bartender has always made it enjoyable for me and the Wife.  He is the biggest reason why we keep going back and we Lee bringing friends.  Thank you Byron for always giving us your undivided attention, making us laugh, giving us our drinks with a smile and a compliment and I'd give an extra star but he like the Dallas Cowboys... =P jk  Here's to Byron!"}
{"text":"Both good and service were great.  The only reason I'm knocking of one star is the amount of bird poop on the chairs upstairs. No one wiped off the chairs before they took us up to our table.  A little gross..."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for our waitress who ended the visit for us in a positive manner, I would have ranked this visit a 2 star. We sat outside and ordered and we were forgotten about. No water refills and when we received our meal, the guy who brought it to us said they would be right back with the rest of the food. Well he didn't come back. I wish I could remember her name; short black hair and tattoos... she came over and asked us if we were ok and we let her know what was going on. She apologized and then took care of us the rest of the night! Our previous waiter never came back to the table until we were leaving. Bc of her, I gave a 4. She was wonderful! The staff seemed stress as they were running around. Not sure if you guys are low staffed at the moment but hopefully this doesn't happen to another family. Thanks to our amazing waitress!!!"}
{"text":"A good solid three stars, not quite four, so unofficially 3.5.  We went and took advantage of the half price appetizers and got the nachos.  The tray was huge and would have been a good deal even if we paid the full price of $12.   We also received a discount for presenting our spring training game ticket from Camelback, so another discount!   We had burgers and they were very good, and a very good sized serving.   We sat outside, the only customers outside, so we were a little neglected, but not to the point of being abandoned.  However I would sit inside next time."}
{"text":"This place wax horrible!! Sunday afternoon, not busy, service was horrible and food was horrible."}
{"text":"Unless your into the metal melicia, loud music so as you cannot hear yourself think, and terrible food, then this place is for you. The food is less than terrible and WAY over priced for the quality! Oh ya I think they don't even put liquor in the drinks, our were way watered down! I know we are in a recession, but really what the heck??"}
{"text":"I went to this place thought it was cool but It was a disappointment to me and my boyfriend when I ordered an 8 oz salmon but when they served it the salmon looks smaller from what I ordered and got charged for the expensive one so ok that's fine and my bf ordered a steak and it was horrible.. Food wise is not that great, the server was like a crackhead missing some teeth and never check back on us if we needed more drinks. Poor service...no wonder this place is not busy compared to the other restaurant on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times but that was before I became a Yelper, so now I can let you all in on my experience. Came to eat before going to Comicon at Gila River Arena. My friend got a steak burger & fries, which she really enjoyed, & I ordered the Kettle O' Rings, which I split with another friend previously on a \"hockey date\", as we called it since we were headed to the game after dinner. The Kettle O' Rings are so good & come with a Chipotle Mayo dip & another dipping sauce just as good. The rings are golden brown, perfectly cooked & seasoned, & light, not super heavy as some other places rings are. You definitely get your money's worth! I ate all but 5 of my rings!  We picked a good time to come eat because the restaurant wasn't packed as it has been the few visits I've had before. It was quiet & we ladies enjoyed our meal & had a good looking waiter all to ourselves  He was very efficient & provided us with excellent service.   My friend liked the place & of course I do too."}
{"text":"We decided to do a little bar hopping and started here....It was full of fabulous people and in Giants gear! Wuuhuu! People were riding the bull, music was playing people were laughing, drinking, eating and having a great time. This experience was way better than the one I had at Universal, California.   We ordered drinks only...munchies not kicked in yet.   The Sweet Tea served in that big carafe was very good. It's 13.00 bucks but well worth it! Cheers!!"}
{"text":"First and LAST time in there. Prices are outrageous. More than $5 for a bottle of domestic? Really? Well my money will not ever go there. To top it off food was medicore at best. 26$ for a sampler? Service was so so."}
{"text":"Went there with reservations at 630 pm, took about 10 min for them to set a table of 8. It took 25 min to get our drinks that we ordered as soon as we sat down almost every order at the table was wrong, soup but didn't give them a spoon, salads brought with and after the meal, wrong sides, a prime rib that had a fist size piece of fat and crap. Service was horrible, steak was very good, shrimp over cooked and side vegetables were cold. Ordered a Long Island tea made with Diet Coke and received a long tea and a separate Diet Coke. Not very happy and won't return. We complained but the waiter said he could do anything about it."}
{"text":"Over the years I have been to Saddle Ranch many times for lunches, date night, or when family is in town and it is always a consistent and great meal for any occasion.  I've tried a bunch of their food and it is always good with HUGE portion sizes, I have never been home without a to-go box!!!! After almost every meal our table has been served a complementary 3 foot tall tower of Cotten Candy!! Very friendly staff!  The one meal I really miss that was recently removed from their menu was the Country Fried Steak. If owners are reading this review, please...please...pleassseee put it back on the menu! k thanks ;)  Also, if you have never taken a bull by the horns....or in this case a mechanical bull...you've got to ride the bull for some great country fun!!!"}
{"text":"We walked in and looked around. It was quite busy. We thought it would be fun and give it a try. As we were waiting for a table, one of the people in our party went to the bathroom. On the way to the restroom, one of the waitress' was walking and she turned around abruptly and happened to smack her in the face. There was no real apology and she moved on. My friend was super stunned and did not know what to say. She then got really mad, went up to the front told us. We talked to the front person and she didn't seem sympathetic at all and brushed it off. At that point we decided to leave. My friends and I would never go back because of that callous attitude by the staff. And by the other reviews on here, why would anyone frequent a place that has high prices, cold food, rude wait staff and long wait times. There are so many more options in that area"}
{"text":"Located in the Westgate Center. Plenty of parking, especially slow on Tuesday at lunch time . Was almost like ghost town empty. Went to Calico Jacks first but they were not open at about 12:15 pm although sign said open and saw some movement inside, but my spidey senses said move on. Saddle ranch right across the way was open so we scooted on over in the 110+ heat to the ranch. Kinda cool outside they had complimentary lemonade and  water. The decor was kinda western themed and not to big of a restaurant. Nice big bar in the center of the room. The have some really cool signs all over the restaurant with funny sayings ( nice touch). After being seated the manager Julie came over and greeted us and then the 5 star service began. We got drinks and asked her what she recommended. She gave us a list of 3. I went with the sloppy joe and fries. The drink service was tops with glasses never more than 60% empty without replacement or being asked if we wanted more. The food came out presented very nicely on a western themed metal platter. The beef looked like ground steak they did in house as its a steakhouse. The meat was cooked perfectly and excellent mix of house seasonings and a jack daniels sauce I think. The tiny onions mixed in perfectly. The bun is hard to master but they did it. Usually the bread falls apart at many places.... No dice it held up extremely well. It was perfect. They serve a bunch of fries, whatever they were uhhh fries. So after treating me like the king, she brings out this outrageous mountain of cotton candy. We could barely dent this 8th wonder of the world, so she bagged it up to go. She bought the dessert... How sweet it is. Overall great experience and I'll be back for sure. See Julie, it's like getting a new really cool friend. Thanks"}
{"text":"I came here to have a birthday celebration with my friends. We needed a table for 10. The hostess refused to seat us until she could count ten heads even though some were still parking. She said they had a table for us but couldn't seat until all present. We took our party elsewhere. They lost the potential for a large revenue and tip that evening."}
{"text":"Stopped by before the Hockey game...Rosie from Mass was a great bartender!  Great place to start your night!"}
{"text":"We held a birthday party with 25+ people in the VIP room and it was great!!!  It was easy to book the room and very affordable, the service was fantastic with fun servers, and the food was AWESOME!  I would go back to have a dinner with friends or book the room again for another private event."}
{"text":"Great steak. Wonderful wedge salad. Service was awesome but I was there during a slow time after lunch. The manager came around and checked on me and gave me a free dessert. So sweet. It's the little things that make you want to come back. Maybe a little too pricey."}
{"text":"Food was good and the service outstanding! Visited with my wife.  The manager welcomed us warmly after learning we were from out of town. He gave us shots on the house, and after my wife inquired about the cotton candy dessert, he gave us one on the house!"}
{"text":"The last two times I've been to Saddle Ranch, it's been disappointing. Both times, my group and I arrived during dinnertime and asked to be seated inside for dinner. When we arrived, the entire restaurant was practically empty and yet both times, they told us that the wait was 45 min- an hour due to \"reserved parties.\" Yet like I said, nobody was there and in the time we were there, I never saw one \"reserved party\" arrive. While the wait to sit inside was 45 min - an hour, coincidentally enough, they always have seating available on the patio which is where they seated everyone who were walk-ins. Since we were hungry, we ended up sitting out on the patio and the seats inside remained empty for the majority of the time we were there. Do they want people to sit on the patio to make it seem like more people are at Saddle Ranch then really are? Who knows, but when it's that hot it's too to eat outside. I understand that restaurants get crowded, but we've now come to Saddle two times and have been told it's too full to be seated inside both times and we could either wait an hour, leave or sit on the patio in 115 degree weather. Next time I will probably choose another restaurant to visit when it's time to pause the Saturday activities and have a bite to eat in a lively setting. Instead, I'll keep this place on my list when I need a spot for a rowdy night out and I don't need sit-down service."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing happy hour and we love coming here with our family! We have always enjoyed our food and we have never had an issue with our order. All of the appetizers that we have had have been delicious! The chili is really good but the kettle serving is very small. I like the sweet potato fries and the marshmallow dip is surprisingly delicious! The nachos are very good and their guacamole is yummy! The jalapeño mac n cheese is delicious and the chicken strips are a family favorite!   We had Misty as a server tonight and she did a great job! She was very helpful, kind, she kept our drinks refilled and she was right on our requests."}
{"text":"Saddle Ranch is like a family reunion if your family involves the entire drinking population of ASU. I swear every time I'm here I get a blast from the past in the form of someone I barely knew years ago, yet still feel the need to acknowledge as if we were great friends even though really we just went Rocky Point together one year but I don't even remember their name because there was like 12 of us, and they were in the other car and I wasn't even 100% sure whose friend they were or if anyone even knew them at all. So that's always fun.  I can't get draft beer here, which is a bummer because they have big Fat Tires on draft for $8, which I would normally be all about except for I can't trust myself to contain 24 ounces of dark beer while wearing 4 inch heels and maneuvering around crowds of drunk people, not to mention a staircase. They do get busy but I've never waited too long for a drink. They have like 4 different bars, and like 12 bartenders on their busy nights, so they actually keep up really well.   I've only ever eaten here when I was hungover, but the chicken tenders are good, as they always are at 10:30 in the morning after a bender. And they have $1.99 Bloody Mary's and Mimosas on Weekend Mornings, so I can't complain there.  Yes, the crowd can be a bit...douchey. But I've never really been bothered by anyone. Honestly, I'm a fan of anywhere in Scottsdale that does NOT offer Bottle Service. There's also no cover, barely ever a line, and the staff doesn't act like they're doing anyone any favors by gracing us with the opportunity to spend money there. I usually have a pretty good time here, even without the ASU Drinking Congregation reunion. That's like a bonus. A-OK!"}
{"text":"Just amazing service! Imagine my shock as I read the other reviews about bad service at this location! My husband and I were out for a rare Friday night out without the kids and decided to stop and check out the menu He has some pretty restrictive dietary issues so we wanted to see if there was anything he could eat.  We were greeted at the door by a very friendly woman who introduced herself as the manager. She was very helpful when I asked about the menu items and things my husband could eat. She personally seated us in a comfortable corner. The waitress came pretty quickly and was also very nice and helpful.  Much to our surprise, we were looking at the menu when the manager showed up at our table with a complimentary appetizer that was friendly to my husband's dietary restrictions. I thought that was the most amazing thing and went a very long way towards customer service. It was completely unexpected and very very much appreciated.  We placed our order in a reasonable amount of time and food showed up pretty quickly. It was entertaining watching a few people try to stay on the mechanical bull that was across from our table. The food tasted fine, not great, but I have had worse and it was cooked as we had requested.  I had ordered a mai tai the small size and someone brought the large size to our table, but they only charged us for the small one since that is what I had ordered. Again, great customer service.  Overall we had a fantastic experience. The service was exemplary and we would definitely consider going back again. I don't know if this is a new manager but she certainly did an amazing job. Kudos!!"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. Too many married or just plain old single men hovering around the mechanical bull with their cameras in hopes they'll see a women's tits flop out or land on their lap. Overpriced drinks, creepy artificial bartenders and too many old perverted men who haven't been laid in some time or hope to cheat on their wifey and kids."}
{"text":"Can't really say anything bad about here the food was pretty good large portions. I had the French dip and it was tasty.  If you like watching drunk people ride the mechanical bull then this is the place for you.  We were a lil entertained by that lol.  The bartender was awesome.  Drinks were strong so no complaints there.  Just don't recommend going on event nights."}
{"text":"I just had to review SR in Glendale.  Unlike the Sunset Strip location the people here are warm, inviting and overly friendly.   The happy hour rocks and the food won't leave you hungry by any means!"}
{"text":"Hilarious place! Went here when a girlfriend and her friend were visiting from Chicago. Of course, everybody wanted someone to ride the bull as it was early and there wasn't too much going on... They paid for it, I was all in. I am going to say the braid, glasses, and sweatpants that all screamed I was whisked away from studying for an exam are what spared me from the \"sexy time\" settings they normally use for ladies that is almost uncomfortable to watch. It was fun!  I was surprised how easy it was to fall off!  Later a young waitress started talking to me about cutting my hair for $10 and coming to my house...she was also way young and just completed an erotic choreographed dance. I took her number but declined the offer. Decent laid back food and environment sure to give a laugh."}
{"text":"Pretty cool-looking bar. Of course, it's cowboy themed and what's says cowboy than a  cool mechanical bull?!   Really nice atmosphere, came here with two colleagues for drinks (not food) on a Friday night around 11 p.m. Despite the nice atmosphere, plenty of places to sit and stand, and the mechanical bull, there wasn't a whole lot of people in the bar which isn't a bad thing since the bar was easy to access, but it seems like this place is more of a sit down/casual drink spot. Might need to try to come back on a Saturday night to see if there's more life.  With that said, I would probably come back here to try out their food too and enjoy a beer. I haven't tried the bull yet (I would need some more drinks before going up in front of everyone haha) but it's definitely a nice addition to the ranch!"}
{"text":"We came here to have a great time since it was my gf 21st birthday. It was our first time here and it looked like a very welcoming place. It started off good and later turned into a disaster. Food was brought out wrong and scattered. We had 2 other guest whose food came out after everybody was done eating. The server was very friendly. But very disorganized. I expected so much more especially since it's a special day. We are really disappointed in the way we were served and probably will take our celebrations elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"My brother, son and I went for a meal here after I taught a group yoga warmup at the Color Run and it was a disappointment. There was a significant wait time even though there weren't many people in the restaurant. The customer service was lackluster in addition to it taking a really long time for us to get our food. The glass for the specialty drink I ordered had lipstick on it, so rather than make me a new one, they just poured it into another glass. It ruined the effect of the colors of the ingredients in the specialty drink when they should have just remade the drink for me in a clean glass. The food was okay, not great. This isn't an establishment I would recommend to others."}
{"text":"**WARNING** .... **WARM BEER ALERT**.... Went for a quick bite last night, day time temperature was 114 degrees. I order my $7.50 large Bud Light which came in a standard pilsner glass and it wasn't barely chilled. I figure that by the time I get to the bottom it'll be nasty hot. The WARM BEER was taken back and removed from my tab, no problem. So, I then ordered a $4.50 bottle ASSUMING that it would have been on ice or for sure from a different chiller but THAT TOO WAS WARM BEER. The bottle came to the table along with a barely chilled glass which could not get the beer cold at all. Didn't bother with that one...just drank my WARM BEER with my quick bit to eat.  Service was good, food was good, no wait time or seating issues. the only issue I had was \"WARM BEER\"  And because of the \"WARM BEER\"..... I doubt I will ever return."}
{"text":"Happy hour on game day! Most of these places in Wingate do not have hh on game day but there guys do. Yummy food, drinks and cheap prices. Sit at the bar for fast service if you are in a rush since they do get busy."}
{"text":"So far we are at 5 stars i write drafts as i'm at the place, then finish them later, the staff has been great! Our server was the best server that I've had in awhile, she was on top of everything got our drinks for us fast and hung out when she wasn't busy, if we walked outside to the patio she found us and would check up on us! She joined the rest of the girls in the punching game in the back corner of the bar and she could throw a punch for a little girl did better then a couple guys that were there and had tried.  They have cotton candy that come in a metal martini glass and they also have outside on the fire pits that have a pan above the fire and they put some stuff in it to make it smell good, not that it smelled bad out.  The other thing they have there is a meachanical bull, that only women should ride because when guys ride the bull it just doesn't look right!  Overall I would love to come back to this place simple based off how great of sevrvice we recieved! And it doesn't hurt to have all the other stuff they have there."}
{"text":"Had we not been trying to kill time to catch the Pacquaio fight which turned out to start an hour later than we thought, we definitely would have been upset by the extremely slow service but in this case, it worked for us.   The service did improve dramatically when Alfonso Soriano and his group were seated at the table next to us though. We definitely reaped the benefits of sitting next to a VIP party.  My husband got a steak and I got a burger. Neither we the best we'd ever had but neither were the worst. Food and service I'd probably give 2 stars.  The ambiance of this place is what you go here for. It's a very lively place with plenty to look at whether it be the people riding the mechanical bull or just people watching. It was also a great place to catch the fight. If I'm back in the area, I'd probably go check out some other places first, but it was a good place that suited our needs."}
{"text":"Great environment for hanging out or watching the game. The service and food were good."}
{"text":"My plane landed at 1:30. My friend took me straight to Z'Tejas for lunch, where we started in on some margaritas. We then hit 2 other places, and ended up at Saddle Ranch around 6:00.  There is a mechanical bull.  A guy hit on us by telling us a racist joke as his opening line.  We then settled in by talking to 2 guys who kept their left hands in their pockets the entire time. Uh huh.  I'm so glad I wasn't sober when we walked in, or else I wouldn't have been able to handle it. The universe was looking out for me that day."}
{"text":"I have to be honest, after reading all the negative reviews, I didn't want to eat at this place. But it was my nephew's birthday, and we were with a group of family members who wanted to try it out. (I think the Western theme and the bull had something to do with that.) Anyway, we had a great time, the service couldn't have been better, and the food was fine. We were seated quickly, our drinks arrived promptly and our food was piping hot. No limp fries! We ordered a variety of food, from salad to prime rib. I had the BBQ cheeseburger, which I would order again. Our server, K.J. even brought out a complimentary round of Mai tai drinks served in a shot glass because we told him we were celebrating a birthday. Everyone was happy with their experience, and my nephew rode the bull to top off his day. We would definitely return."}
{"text":"It wasn't that busy there were plenty of tables available but we still had to wait to get seated. Maybe they were short staffed... They did have a sign that said now hiring... They were friendly greeted us with smiles and kept us in the loop on the status of our food. The food was good nothing to rage about. I had the tortilla soup and it could have used a little more seasoning and less rice. The cotija cheese was perfect on there. My friends had the veggie omelet with hash browns which was very tasty.  I did like the variety of mimosas they offered I had the strawberry blonde mimosa and it was really good. However we were all in the mood for michiladas but they don't carry so that was sad. The overall experience was good but there are a few things that could be better."}
{"text":"We came here for the Fiesta Bowl and after the game for New Years Eve.  It was packed - but still the service was better then what I thought it would be for being so crowded.  I been here before, so new what to expect.  Love coming here before football games.  Always good sevice, great location, I got heir wings and chicken quesadilla and was pleased.  Will be back for the Super Bowl.    I didn't think the price was costly for the food - and while it was New Years' Eve - I was disappointed that our group had to pay $25/person to just come in to eat dinner.  I know they had a DJ performing later - but $25.00 to just come in and eat seemed pricey - and although I could of left and went somewhere else - I didn't - and I knew about the charge up front - so I can't blame them for it."}
{"text":"Second visit and boy it's like night and day.   Our first visit was a Sunday night.. place was night busy, server was very attentive.  We even got a free side of jalapeno mac and cheese which was delicious.   I ordered fried chicken breast which turned out to be mostly breading on a very thin piece of chicken.  The breading fell off all of it as I tried to cut it.  We visited for the second time on a Friday night.   I made reservations through OpenTable and commented that we wanted a booth.  When we arrived there was no wait.. but there also wasn't a booth to be had.  Our waitress spent 90% of her time in the kitchen.   We spent alot of time waiting on her.. waiting on drinks, etc.   When we could catch her to remind her about a glass of water or a bottle of ketchup she'd go do 2 or 3 other things before making a trip for what we'd asked for.   One drink sat at the bar while we watched her at the table right next to it.  When she walked the other way, I went to the bar and retrieved it.    The nachos were sparse for almost $15 ($12 plus $3 for chicken on them).   Our food came out one meal at a time and the last of the 4 orders (a burger) took forever and was done without the thousand island dressing on it that had been requested.    I have also found some inconsistencies in things.  Our first time there, we brought home an order of jalapeno mac and cheese to go.  It came in a large box.  Tonight we ordered the same thing, the same price and what we got was in a considerably smaller box and a lot smaller portion.  We waited so long so many times for the waitress on the second visit that I want to the counter to order our 3 to-go orders.   The waitress must have seen me because all the sudden she appeared right next to the person I was talking to.  I'm sure she assumed I was complaining about her.  There are so many options for food in Westgate that Saddle Ranch needs to step up their game and be more consistent.   I'll be heading back to Whiskey Rose next time I am in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Stopped at Saddle Ranch before Coyotes game March 18. Party of 4 including my 4 year old grandson.  My daughter in law was given a plastic up because we were told they didn't have any other glasses clean.  Ordered our food, waited 40 minutes went and spoke to the manager on duty about our long wait for food.  He told me he would take care of it.  Returned from kitchen and told us that it was a crazy weekend & food would arrive soon.  Waited another 20 minutes and the food never arrived.  Terrible service, place was a mess and the restaurant was not even half full."}
{"text":"I am a waiter and was dining with other waiters, so usually we are pretty understanding when servers are busy. But this was on another level. I would give this establishment 0 stars if I could. First, our waiter didn't greet our table for 15 minutes. Then it took an additional 15 minutes just to get our drinks. They were fountain drinks too, not bar drinks. She forgot to bring us waters, we got our appetizer before our drinks and they came without plates or napkins. Then after we finished our appetizer, they dropped our check and we had to write the tip in before the food even got to us. They also asked for a credit care at the very first greet to start a tab which we though was really odd. For our dinner, which took quite a while to get delivered, Me, my cousin and her husband all ordered the same exact thing and mine was the only one that came correctly. We ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich without any modifications and my cousins came with no lettuce, onion and tomato, and her husbands came without bacon or a pickle. They were also very cold and clearly had been sitting in the window for quite some time. My niece ordered a kids mac and cheese with fruit and ate her fruit first. She's a really slow eater and took her first bite of mac and cheese after it had been sitting on the table for at least 10 minutes. Upon taking her first bite, she burst into tears because her pasta was so hot. She spit it out into a napkin and then we dumped it out to let it out onto a plate to let it cool off and it was steaming soooooo much. My 5 year old niece was in tears for most of our meal because she burnt herself so badly. She was scared to even eat one bite of the pasta after that. The managers also knew we were frustrated, and didn't do anything to remedy the situation. They didn't apologize, take anything off the check, even acknowledge the terrible service we were receiving. Nothing. We will never be dining at saddle ranch again. Adult food came out cold as ice and kids came out so hot she was sobbing. Are you serious? Our waitress was clearly far in the weeds, but regardless, the service we received was unacceptable."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars, I would give this place a negative 5 stars! This place is HORRIBLE! Service was the WORST I've had ANYWHERE! We had about a 35 minute wait, which we expected since we were there for the Blackhawks/Coyotes game. We were finally sat about 5:30pm. It took until 5:45 before someone came to take our drink order. By then, we already knew what we wanted for dinner. So we placed our order. I ordered an appetizer of chicken tenders and a side of sweet potato fries. My husband got the steak sandwich with regular fries. Our server brought our drinks about 5 minutes later, and that was the last time we saw her.   That is, until I went to the front and asked for the manager 30 minutes later. The manager didn't come, but our server came over and we asked her where our food was and that we wanted refills of our drinks. She brought our drinks, but didn't bring our food. Another 15 minutes went by, still no manager and still no food. So my husband got pissed and said we would just get food at the game. Our server was walking by, so he walked into her path and told her we were leaving because we still didn't have our food, but we would pay for our drinks. She told him not to worry about it. I went looking for a manager because 45 minutes was a ridiculous amount of time to wait for food, no matter how busy the place was.   I finally flagged down the girl at the front and she found a manager for me. The manager came over, we told him the issues and he said he would get our food right out. As he said that, our food came out. It was 6:30 by this time. He took our bill from the table and said, \"let me see what I can do.\" and walked away. 5 minutes later as we were scarfing down our food, he came back and said, \"I took care of the sweet potato fries and gave you 20% off the rest of the food.\" WTF?! Seriously??? 20% isn't crap! Giving us a 20% discount is like giving us the middle finger. The manager should have just taken care of the entire bill.   Never ever EVER going to that place again! Will go back to the Whisky Rose again!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed,  our server let us down  Didn't like my drink, told him, he said he would be back. Waited waited. Saw him hanging around went by us several times.went to the bar got my drink. Not coming back. Need to train your server"}
{"text":"**THREE SOLID STARS FOR THE SADDLE RANCH**  We met our group here for the party bus and enjoyed an average brunch which included bottomless mimosas.   I personally drank 10.  Didn't realize that there was a bull to ride. The ATM machine charged me $3.50 for the transaction fee which I thought was BULL.   ORDERED:  *SCRAMBLED EGGS as a side - Tasted overcooked and sloppy.  *BANANA NUT FRENCH TOAST - Not the kind that would make me jizz in my golf skirt, but it was OK. The bananas were not ripe and the flavors were meh. There were three slices and we finished two.  With the 10 mimosas, the day did get better.  I wouldn't recommend this place for brunch. Maybe for the bar and the bull."}
{"text":"I can dig...what can go wrong when you have a mechanical bull in your establishment??  Think I need one in my office :)  Down to earth fun and every time I come, they're rocking 80's music.  Man I'm getting old.  How does one become a mechanical bull ride navigator?  That guy has the best job!  First off - dudes, yeah just stay off the bull it's not cool.  Gals, please step right up - this is where the fun begins.  You can imagine the decor of the place...old western style.  Drink specials isn't much to rave about but they do well.  As for dining here...I'm not sure.  I feel a tad bit dirty for some reason when I'm done with this place - enjoy!"}
{"text":"(I have not ate at this Saddle Ranch. This review is for SR on weekend nights after 10 pm).  You will like Saddle Ranch in Old Town Scottsdale if you are:  A creepy middle aged guy A creepy douchebag OR An attention seeking skank of a female who likes to ride mechanical bulls in super short dresses  Seeing as how I am none of those, I dislike Saddle Ranch as a bar/late night destination. Plus the bar service sucks and you can get cheaper beer at other places."}
{"text":"This was pretty sad. Would of gave 2 stars but may be it was a slow night? Place was near empty at 10pm on a Friday night. The saddle ranches in LA are always jam-packed. Got a drink and left after 20 minutes"}
{"text":"\"Why is everything I touch sticky?\"  That pretty much sums things up for Saddle Ranch. We sat at the bar for a quick drink before heading in to Jobbing.com Arena. We were robbed, sweated a bit in the lack of air condition, and got sticky in the process.   Also, what's the deal with the plastic cups that are supposed to look like glass? They just look scratched up and dingey. Nasty.  For $25 all we got was 1 beer, 1 mixed drink and 2 sad shots. Waste of money. Go  to the Yard House for better beer and atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service we had was even better. Kyle our server was on top of anything we needed and made sure we were being taken care of. He was AMAZING. If your in the area I would definitely recommend stopping by. And ask for Kyle you will be treated like royalty."}
{"text":"The highlight of this place is literally the mechanical bull right next to the entrance. It's only $3 to get a ride on the bull. The guy who was operating the bull was very nice & friendly - he was enthusiastic about explaining the instructions. If you have never ridden a mechanical bull before, they will go a little easier on you - slow & steady. However, they can easily turn it up a notch with the bull making sharp turns and quickly thrusting forwards/backwards to knock you out. Overall, a very entertaining night watching other people give it a try.   I would have given this place 3 stars for a nice location at Westgate and the good ambiance. The server promptly took our orders and delivered our drinks. We later asked our server at the counter to give us the bill. We waited and waited for almost 30 minutes - still no bill. She was doing a million other things, and I don't know if she forgot or thought we were unimportant. When we had to remind her a second time, it only took her 1 minute to get the bill to us. She failed to give us our bill in a timely manner, and wasted 30 minutes of my life. 2 stars for bad service."}
{"text":"Wish I would've checked yelp first. We were shopping at Tanger outlets and wanted a sit down lunch so came here. They were completely empty, yet our server was nowhere to be found through our meal. We ordered things that never arrived, never got refills, food was mediocre, and had to wait to pay our check because our server was missing again. Don't go."}
{"text":"This is a GREAT place for Happy Hour!   Drinks are 1/2 price as are appetizers.  They are always accommodating of large groups.  The choices for appetizers can pretty much be a full meal...even to share!  I will never ride the bull but I will always point and laugh at the person riding and then falling off!"}
{"text":"Today was an unnessarily horrible experience.   \"Late\" for brunch at 11 on Sun.  No 1.99 mimosas...although has 1.99 sign. Ordered mimosa and a hot coffee w Baileys.. $20!  For a $7 mimosa & coffee drink? And waitress couldnt even explain why it was $20...\"oh i dont know how much they are, its all computerized. \" Seriously!?"}
{"text":"They have a mechanical bull.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"We had a party of 10, ordered hour food, no one was in the place so they could not have been busy. Food didn't come out. Terrible service. The hostess had attitudes. The manager was a pointless waste of time to try to talk too. I will never come back here again."}
{"text":"With a kitchen open til one in the morning, this place takes care of you for breakfast, lunch and dinner plus the midnite snack. The drinks are reasonably priced and I recommend going deep into the menu. Baseball cut steak, tortilla soup, Thai crunch salad..... This place is far more than just a chop house. Yum."}
{"text":"Service was okay. But this review is to say so NOT order the BLT. The weird spicy cheese way too crunchy bread is awful! It ruined the whole sandwich. Who thought up this stupid combo?!"}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes to place our dinner order. This place is understaffed. Server was friendly but way over worked. Plus, our bill was incorrect. Good food, poor service. This place is only good for grabbing an over priced beer."}
{"text":"Nothing like seeing a manager walk away from a server when the server asks for them to talk to angry customers (we waited over 45 minutes for our nachos and it still took ten minutes on top of that to pay for the few things we were served.) Classy.  Our compensation for the horrible experience? A $20 tab for a margarita and one kids pizza. (We had two kids with us. One didn't get his food.)"}
{"text":"An absolutely abomination and an insult to anyone who has ever patronized a restaurant on this planet. After waiting a fair amount of time for a table, we ordered drinks and food from what I would consider an extremely limited menu.  We allotted ourselves 90 minutes to eat and then walk 20 feet over to the hockey game, which anyone will tell you is probably more than enough time. Apparently, it is not enough time at this restaurant. After our drinks came, we didn't get a visit from the server, ever. But we watched as entire tables were sat and fed while we waited. I pulled the server over and requested an update, and she told us the food was almost ready. 15 more minutes, and we stood up and left. We had sat there 55 minutes with no food. And we ordered basic, what I would consider quick, fried bar food. We almost missed face off at the hockey game because this place sucked so much.   The server chased after me and said not to worry and that they would take care of the drinks. Um, yes you will. Idiot."}
{"text":"Awesome staff who tries and gets to know their customers personally by dropping by each table and talking to them. like someone said before, atmosphere of Country meets Rock 'n'Roll.  They even had a guy with a guitar who helped me with my date by singing us songs. HUGE portions with good food. I just have to come on a weekend and see how the whole mechanicall bull comes into play!!"}
{"text":"Fun place.  Great atmosphere.  Food is just awful.  Waitresses are great at throwing extra drinks on your bill.  Happened more than once so check your tab."}
{"text":"Read that they show UFC fights. Got there and was immediately greeted by 2 bartenders whose soul purpose was to get me bombed. Unfortunately I wanted to see the fight and not the elderly woman on a mechanical bull. I'll give it another shot. The food looked like pretty good bar food btw."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that Saddle Ranch Chop House is one of the few places open on Sunday around 3pm... that's how we ended up eating a late lunch / early dinner there.  I called Arcadia Farms, Orange Table, Sugarbakers, and Bandera with no such luck... so, Saddle Ranch came to the rescue in that sense.  I was with 2 girlfriends and we all decided that it was probably 'first a bar, then a restaurant' based on the food we had.  2 of us shared a cobb salad and a veggie burger, and the other had one of the chicken wraps.  Cobb salad - eh... (maybe it would've been better with tomato but because of the recent scare, no tomato for us!)  Veggie burger - not so much - pretty bad but we dressed it up with avocado, lettuce, ketchup, and mustard.  We did have the sweet potato casserole as a side and that was delicious - on the sweet side though so be warned!  I did notice a decent size breakfast menu and of course the bull that was resting during the time we were there... he probably had a rough night the night before!  Service was just ok... waitresses (and I do say waitresses because they are all women) are all showing their midriffs and a little bit ditzy.  It took awhile to get drink refills and to pay our bill, but it was fine.  There you have it... 3 stars for Saddle Ranch for now.  I'll be back for the beer tower (not the food) if and when i return!"}
{"text":"My cuzn took me here when i was visiting him in AZ. I gotta same its pretty bomb. Buffalo tenders were some of the best ive had. Slide were awesome as were the (mini) ribs or whatever you call them. They make a great long island too!  Its all cowboy themes out & they have a mechanical bull to throw fools on their arse! Only thing sucked is there were more guys than girls down to tangle with it...maybe because it was kinda early. Ill have to go again when its later and do a 2nd review. They aso have med tvs eveywhere showing diff sporting events. This spot gets 4 thumbs up! which equals 4 stars.  If your in the area...do ittt!"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch and ordered the Rib-eye which was absolutely amazing!! Besides the spectacular food, the service we received from Kaylee was phenomenal. We was on the ball, always coming to check on us, extremely polite and friendly. Also very pleasant. Truly a wonderful experience. Needless to say she went above and beyond to the point where she provided probably one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. Would definitely come back many times over!!"}
{"text":".... this place SUCKS.  Customer Service is the worst I've ever experienced in a long time.  Food was horrible. My sister's order was spoiled and they served it anyway.  Drinks?  As mentioned, the waiter was horrible.  And the manager?  He had no backbone to ensure our waiter was doing what he is paid to do.  Aside from the snide comments from lackluster waiter, which was cute - cause I've been called worse, this place isn't a place to dine at. :("}
{"text":"Last week we visited The Saddle Ranch; as always the service was great, the Food was good & We enjoyed the atmosphere. I have spent quite a few evenings at this restaurant & I always have a good time, however, I'm not sure that I will be able to continue doing so because the prices are getting to be ridiculous!! On our last visit, there was a Coyotes game going on; perhaps prices rise based on the Events in the area? There are other restaurants, very close to this place, that offer the same quality service & food for a lot less."}
{"text":"Despite the mixed bag of Yelp reviews I encountered before my dine-in at Saddle Ranch Chop, I decided to give this place the benefit of the doubt. Sadly, I made the same mistake as the previous Yelpers.  I ordered the \"Classic\" sirloin and the portion was much smaller than I ever could have imagined. It would have been nice if it was at least of \"chop house\" quality but it was just like any other piece of meat you would find at the local Jonny Rockets. To top it all off, I was over charged when the bill came out and burned the midnight oil waiting for our waitress to fix the mistake. Trying to pull a fast one on an out-of-towner... Smh. :/   My best advice would be to give one of the other restaurants in the Westgate Entertainment Center a try and save the Saddle Ranch Chop House as your plan B... or Z..."}
{"text":"We went to Westgate for Yardhouse, but it was so packed.  And the wait for 2 people were 40 mins.  My teenage god-daughter was straving so we opted out to find somewhere else that served chicken tenders (her favie).  We reviewed the menu outside and ok, what the hey.  It is 3/4 full inside.  We were seated behind the bar.    We sat and ordered:  chicken strips with a side of french fries & french dip.  The chicken strips were plenty and they were good.  A light coat of crispy and chicken.  The french dip was GOOD, tasty beef slices, and au jus was perfect (normally I think most places makes it salty).    Our server was awesome, she checked on us many times and made sure our drinks were filled.  At the end of the meal, she brings the check and a cotton candy (HUGE and on the house from the owners).  It was very nice.  My teenager inhaled it.  LOL!"}
{"text":"Since saddle ranch opened I didn't feel I could compose an adequate opinion after only seeing ENORMOUS mixed drinks and women gyrating on a mechanical bull.  I felt I needed to at least try the food to form an opinion.  If you've never been one of the first things you'll notice is that every waitress is dressed like a slutty cowgirl. (personally I don't disapprove) but might not be the place to take grandma, unless she's into that.  Other than that our waitress was actually very attentive.  Ok the food...  I found myself conflicted between the Ranch BBQ Burger and the Original N.Y.O. lucky for me I didn't have to make that choice and my awesome wife agreed to order the Ranch BBQ Burger and let me taste it.  After a short while our food came and all dishes were served on what I can only describe as a slab this thing was like 2 ft wide.  My Omelette was huge filled with black forest ham, three peper bacon which was really tasty and tequilla chicken sausage, not to mention a huge helping of hashbrowns.  Keep in mind this is one of the more modest sized dishes. I also tasted my wife's burger and from the little bite I had I would definitely order it.  The waitress asked us if we would like dessert and we politely declined, despite this they decided to give our party a half baked cookie and ice cream dessert on the house.  Even though we were all really full, the cookie dessert was amazing.  Theres something about saddle ranch that like that  I can't describe, It's tasteless, tacky and everything that usually turns me off.  But whatever it is it has a certain charm to me and day or night I place I would come back to.  Maybe because it's not located in Scottsdale proper."}
{"text":"Boobs and juicy chicken... That's what this place is great for. I'm sure this is a fun place to hang out on a busy Friday night. We however came on Halloween night and it wasn't very busy at all. The service was quick and friendly. All of the servers were dressed up, mostly boobs out. Settled on two different chicken sandwiches, (BBQ and Buffalo Ranch) sweet potato fries, house salad and ice teas. Everything was good. The chicken was beyond juicy. We actually inspected the chicken to make sure it was cooked enough because it was just that juicy. The only thing that we didn't find that enjoyable was the marshmallow dipping sauce for the sweet potato fries. I'm sure it would work as a dessert topping but we just found it strange.   Never saw anyone ride the mechanical bull, but I'm sure that would bump this place up to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Normally we love this place.   However something has changed here.  Had to wait forever for service on the second level seating area,  and was completely grossed out by the thick coating of dust on the ceiling fans.   Will have to rethink sitting down at the bar again unless that gets cleaned."}
{"text":"I was skeptical on what to expect coming here because it seems to have such mixed reviews, but I left a happy! It was a Thursday afternoon when I came for happy hour, so it was pretty dead but the happy hour was such a great deal with all the appetizers and drinks being half off. We ordered a couple drinks that come in those big caraffees and it lasted me the entire meal. For food we went with the monster platter? Or whatever the platter is that basically has a sampling of several of the appetizers. Everything was really good, but especially that marshmallow dipping sauce they give you for the sweet potato fries. Delicious.   Mid-eating, the manager walks up with 2 shots and says they're for us on the house. What? Why? But sure! Then about 15 minutes later the hostess comes out with an oversized martini glass that holds their 3 foot tall cotton candy dessert. On the house. I'm assuming this was all because they were pretty dead and we were 2 of the youngest people in there so it may've been a ploy to get us to come back later that night or weekend or spread the word about how great the place was (or write them a great yelp review). Regardless of the intentions, it was a very nice gesture that I will gladly accept. They certainly didn't have to do that, but they did and there aren't many restaurants out there that would do something like that to try to lure more people in or show customer appreciation - so I'll take it. I can see this place being a fun atmosphere at night too, so we'll definitely stop back in if we're ever in town visiting again."}
{"text":"So many restaurants to choose from in this district but coming here was a home run. Came here solo and ate at the bar and Abby was awesome. Great martini, awesome ribeye, nice wine...couldn't be happier!   Don't get sucked into the chain places, Safdle Ranch is the shit!"}
{"text":"Drinks at the bar waiting for a table... awesome... bartender personality, welcoming and made us forget we were waiting on a table....   When we got our table....   Appetizers... were great when they finally showed up... way after we ordered them....  Drinks... showed up after we reminded the server about them....  Prime rib... not cooked even close to order.... the side were great...   The bread amazing... after the second time we asked for it....  Yep... won't be back...."}
{"text":"Service was prompt and friendly.   I ordered the spinach ravioli.  My complaint is that is comes with a side and a salad isn't an option.  The options were almost all potatoes.  Baked potato, sweet potato, french fries, sweet potato fries, mashed potatoes, veggies.  They should think of which sides go with the entrees that come with a side.  A coworker ordered pancakes and was given the same side options.  It's just weird. We were given a complimentary dessert since it was our first time here...it was a huge batch of cotton candy!  It was good.  A unique dessert option that I've never seen anywhere else."}
{"text":"Went for a birthday. The nachos appetizer was huge, it served 5 well. Very good. I must've just ordered a bad entree because I was the only one dissatisfied. I got the French roast sandwich. The server said it was delicious and it was one of their featured items. In my opinion it lacked flavor, and the bread was EXTREMELY dry. It kept a falling apart I couldn't finish the sandwich. The fries were great and so was the spicy ketchup. The server brought us a chocolate chip cookie skillet and huge cotton candy for the birthday girl. The service was EXCELLENT, but I was just not pleased with my entree. I would go again but would definitely not get the French roast dip sandwich!"}
{"text":"Anywhere that offers carafes, yes I said carafe's of long island iced tea is a place I will frequent w/o hesitation. Warning, wait about 10 minutes after the 1st one before ordering another..they sneak up on ya!   We went for happy hour so stuck to the appetizers: Sweet potato fries, eh I've had better. Marshmallows creme dipping sauce was delish, a bit too sweet after a few dips but was yummy. Their chicken tenders weren't anything special, tried them buffalo style. Friend had the chili, she didn't complain. We were there on a Wednesday night, it was pretty dead but the girl behind the bar still wasn't very attentive. My friend had to ask her several times to turn the game on. I'd give her more of a break if it was busy, but it really wasn't. Anthony, the manager however, was really nice. He introduced himself right when we walked in and even brought us a complimentary cotton candy while we sat at the bar (it is a 2 foot tower of cotton candy mind you, they don't joke around).   I've also been there late on a Saturday night, the lower floor was packed. Like bump-into-everyone-takes-forever-to-get-a-drink kinda packed, seemed to be a mix of different types of people. Not too \"Scottsdale\" in my opinion. The don't have a dancefloor, which docked them 1 star. The top floor was still busy but not too bad, a good place to perch and people watch, the drunkards below trying to stay on that dang mechanical bull are quite entertaining."}
{"text":"First let me start off by saying I say I don't go here willingly and go when the group of people I am with want to go. Ok, ok, I am a sheep. This place just goes against everything that is right in this world.   Getting an overpriced drink here is like a Herculean task. There are always about 5-6 people deep around the entire bar waiting to get a drink. So you have to stand in the major thoroughfare in the hopes of getting drunk enough to somewhat enjoy yourself.  Whilst standing there you get bumped into by drunk bachelorettes, DB's, and out of towners who think this place is the TITS.  I mean that spells fun in my book.  I have never eaten the food here, save the cotton candy.  So I don't know if it is any good.  The one redeeming quality is that there is no cover and the line is never very long, so you can come and go as you please without having to have the tell tale stamp the next morning.  Oh, don't get me started on the bull!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! Myself and my husband went here for dinner with my parents and adult son after our wedding to celebrate. When we checked in we were told that it would be a thirty minute wait so we took a seat at the bar and ordered the monster platter as an appetizer. After an hour we got our seats and ordered our dinners and after an hour and a half we finally got our appetizers. At this point I had my sister and her family and my brother and his girlfriend and a close friend and her husband waiting to meet us at yard house for drinks. I asked to speak to a  manager and told him the situation and asked if he could put some tables together in the almost empty restraunt so my guests could sit with us. After an hour of him not getting back to me and after over 2 hours of waiting I had to get my server and tell him that if we didn't have the check for the drinks and appetizers in 2 minutes we were walking out. So there we all were almost 9pm haven't eaten since early morning because we were getting ready for the wedding we walked over to yard house were seated right away and drinks and food came very fast. Moral of the story if you want to get drunk go to saddle ranch if you want to eat and have a nice experience go elsewhere. Thanks for the memorable time guys SMH."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice (once I was taken by friends who paid and once with my husband) and both times I was served bland, overdone, dry, and tasteless food for a premium price.  Service was slow and inattentive.  NEVER going back!"}
{"text":"I had a bad couple experiences coming here because I always came at night while bar hopping.    My boyfriend and I recently came here for dinner and I loved it.  Since we live in the area, we found a 40% off coupon in the mail and decided to use it.  I guess they were trying to use the coupon to lure in locals because the coupon came with a few shots from management too.  Although the food and service were really great, I don't think I would pay full price to come here again.  It's definitely a step above an Applebees or TGIFridays but it's not good enough to pay $15 for a burger.  I may have to come back for the all you can eat ribs night."}
{"text":"We stopped here during one of our many Old Town Scottsdale bar crawls. Imagine at least 50 people dressed in Santa (reindeer, snowmen, Mr. and Mrs. Claus) suits invading this place.   Many of our friends rode the mechanical bull to loud cheers from the crowd. One of my friends was lucky enoguh to meet and flirt with the manager. She was treated to a huge yellow cotton candy feast and a dish of blueberries. I should be so lucky.  Saddle Ranch has a large interior with an outdoor patio (for the smokers, but not for the people who want fresh air because of the stinkin' smokers).  We'll be back, so stay tuned for the next bar crawl and our crazy antics. You should be so lucky."}
{"text":"Would write a pretty lengthy review describing my terrible service, disgusting food, and overall horrible experience but this place is not worth my time.  Guess this explains why every other restaurant in the area had a over a 45 minute wait and this place sat me right away."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, we enjoy bringing friends and relatives here.  Self parking is a mess here, so I use the valet service that's at the front of the restaurant.  It's 100x easier than trying to find parking yourself.  The restaurant is huge and offers indoor & outdoor seating as well as seating on the 2nd level.  We've always dined in the main dining room on the 1st floor.  Here are some of the menu items I've had:  Sweet Potato Fries, $8.99 Jalapeno Mac n Cheese, $10.99 Black Truffle Mac n Cheese, $13.99 Spinach & Artichoke Dip, $10.99 BBQ Burger, $12.99 Filet, $29.99 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/saddle-ranch-chop-house-scottsdale?select=w5yMCDXjT_g93ur6zj0_QA#w5yMCDXjT_g93ur6zj0_QA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/saddle-ranch-chop-house-scottsdale?select=cJOIml3aeW0BW3G8EzFEbw#cJOIml3aeW0BW3G8EzFEbw  I have to say that both their Jalapeno and Black Truffle Mac n Cheese dishes are some of the best Mac n Cheese dishes I've ever had.  They're a must have with every meal when we're here.  The Sweet Potato Fries and Spinach & Artichoke Dip are average.  The BBQ Burger is amazing...very juicy and sloppy with the BBQ Sauce dripping out of the sides of the Burger when I bite into it....yum!  The Filet is above average...I wouldn't say it's one of the best I've had though.  Although I order it slightly Medium Well, I think they leave it on too long because it comes out more on the well side than I prefer.  Most really good Steakhouses will get it right for me.  The atmosphere here is loud and fun.  There's a mechanical bull if that's your deal...on weekend nights, it's comical to watch the drunks jump on it.  On a few of our visits the server gave us complimentary Cotton Candy for dessert.  They're known for that....it's very good and always a pleasant surprise when we get it.  Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"I can't imagine worse service than I received at this restaurant.  We visited for a Sunday brunch, arriving around 11am.  Despite a handful of open tables, we were told to wait (\"20 minutes\") for a table.  30 minutes later, we were seated.  It's a restaurant, sometimes you need to wait...this was a bit annoying, but hey - it happens.  Apparently the table we were seated at was not a part of this restaurant.  We were ignored by several servers.  After about 20 minutes the bar-tender came over, apologized for us not having been served and went to \"go find our server.\"  We never saw her again.  20 minutes later, we complained to the host (who didn't seem to have any idea where he was), and were informed that one of the servers who had been ignoring us (he actually sat down for another conversation at another table) was actually our server.  He had literally walked past our drink-less table a dozen times.  No one was apologetic for this episode.  I'd expect something comped or at least the appearance of a manager (and an apology) for this episode but what we got was complete indifference.  We left.  Angry.  I saw no evidence of any interest in customer service here.  I would not return under any circumstances.  The place was somewhat busy at the time of our visit but not enough to excuse this."}
{"text":"Waited for a table for 35 minutes, which was fine. But then sat down ordered food and drinks and another 35 minutes passed where no drinks were served. All other folks around us were waiting for something and were very frustrated. We ended up leaving without eating or drinking anything. Terrible service, great location and great vibe. But service needs tremendous improvement."}
{"text":"Ride the bulls gals and put on a show :) Just wear pants, please!! Fun spot to get drunk and do kinky things with cotton candy! Great happy hour specials!  Extremely generous bartenders and huge portions of food. Well worth the money!!"}
{"text":"Went here with my wife and friends loved the atmosphere and enjoyed watching people ride the mechanical bull. The food was good I had the herb chicken and mashed potatoes, which came with 3 pieces of broiled chicken breast good amount for the price $17. The wife had BBQ pulled chicken and jasmine cilantro rice also a good amount for the price, had a little spicy kick to it. Had two large bud light drafts and the wife had the sweet tea (alcohol beverage) wasn't very sweet at all. The waiter brought us 2 rounds of shots on the house, white gummy bear delicious! I definitely recommend this restaurant and would go again. $77"}
{"text":"Right in the Glendale Arena area, this place rocks, I mean literally. It's almost like Disney with a rock star twist, Huge indoor area, must've cost at least a cool 5 mil to build. Very touristy yet I was impressed with the service. They didn't scrimp on hiring plenty of nubile, young things to seat you, serve you--After all they have too, those \"plates\" look like platters big enough to hold a Chinook Salmon! My steak was alright a little pricey but ok, hey what can you expect, there was even live entertainment, plenty of hot mama's that wanted to ride the mechanical bull on a podium.  I don't give it 5 stars because I dislike huge corporate venues but this place really seemed to care about it's customers and waitstaff by letting them wear basically whatever they want, as long as it was \"Rocker-Style\" --well sort of with a western twist.  Oh yes, their cotton candy was served in this metal martini looking thing and was about 2 feet tall, high and tall I say.  Since they just opened August 30th, they are not even on dexonline yet but easy to find in the Glendale Arena Complex--I'll snap some pix soon."}
{"text":"Seriously bad service. Bartender ignored us most of the evening, but made a point to upsell us on a bacon wrap for our filet. Took about 30 minutes to get the bill only to find out that the miniscule bit of bacon (which I'm not 100% sure was there) cost FOUR DOLLARS. Plus, the spinach dip was gross."}
{"text":"Yummy place for apps, cocktails and delicious bread pudding!!! Great service.  Try it for a fun group outing!"}
{"text":"Service was great, but it was freezing cold. Food was okay. I love the decor, the bread basket, and the wine pours."}
{"text":"The food was great got the Atlantic salmon it was seasoned well but one side had almost none. Also the sweet potatoes casserole was awful."}
{"text":"We could tell right away when we walked in this place was a bit challenged.   We stood waiting for about 15 minutes while employees walked past and no one seemed to give a damn.  When they finally did come over, they had to go see what was available... (Note:  Ray Charles could have seen what was available.... almost everything was available :) .   They asked us to sit down and we waited some more.     We finally got seated to a dirty table and after the drinks took too long we gave up and went somewhere else.    Ill pay extra for decent food, but not when the staff seems to be mailing it in.     For the same price, try whiskey Roses across the way.     meh."}
{"text":"Despite the bar setting, Saddle Ranch has surprisingly DELICIOUS food!  There's a huge selection of beer and cocktails (even lower-cal options) and their menu has everything from wraps to steaks.   The cornbread and biscuits were addicting--SO GOOD!  I had the southwestern chicken wrap with baked beans. The tortilla was stuffed with tender grilled chicken, romaine lettuce, pico, corn salsa and jack cheese, all in perfect proportion.  The wrap was grilled and served nice and crispy-hot.  The beans were rich and flavorful. My dad had the ahi tuna wrap--I've never seen such a GIGANTIC piece of ahi served for under $10.   Good food, fun atmosphere, very creative desserts (e.g. 3-foot cotton candy surrounded by cookies, chocolate cake, strawberries and whipped cream!)--I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"Was here on a TUESDAY evening with a group of 16 people from work who arrived staggered times between 5 and 7:30 pm.  The place was half empty at BEST.  We arrived around 7pm and most people had already been served food and drink at our table. The table was crowded with dirty plates and glasses.  25 minutes went by before we even saw the waitress serving our table and then had to flag her down.  We ordered an iced tea and a margarita.  The iced tea arrived in about 10 minutes.  30 minutes later the margarita came.  We both ordered hamburgers.  Over ONE HOUR later they arrived.  The meat on the burgers didn't taste like beef, it seemed full of fillers or breadcrumbs maybe.  I only ate a few bites of mine.  The sweet potato fries were good.  Waitress never came back to ask if everything was okay.  People in our group gave up and started going to the bar the get their drinks. The cotton candy desert was fun that someone at our table ordered, and was good, but how can you screw up cotton candy.  Everybody was constantly trying to flag down the waitress to get their bills or a drink.  One person was ready to leave but couldn't get her bill to pay for a good 40 minutes.  The waitress would bring one person a drink and literally run away from our table.  A couple of people rode the mechanical bull - fun to watch but not enough to make me ever come back here.   Don't know if they were short staffed or what the problem was but a good waitress would have told us instead of just trying to avoid doing her job.  Shaking my head....... ******UPDATE******After reading my review, a member from their corporate office asked for my phone number and did call me.  She was very apologetic, wanted to know the waitress' name, and a few other details.  She gave me her name and cell phone number and asked me to call her the next time we planned to go there and that she would buy us a round of drinks and appetizers and would make sure that we had an amazing time.  I'm glad that they care."}
{"text":"I've never had a worse experience at a restaurant than i had here..even mcdonalds would have been better. we came here as a last resort because the breakfast club was overcrowded, and ive heard they have great mimosa's and bloody marys which was exactly what we were looking for. i tend not to dine in scottsdale at these kind of places because of the overtanned, over-steroided, bejeweled-wearing, snotty environment.   first off, there was a long wait - we were offered a free round of drinks on the house because of this...the bartender was new, so when we ordered she neglected to tell us about the different kinds of mimosas and bloody marys they offer...and they are only $2 until 3pm which was a pretty slick deal. try the fallen angel bloody mary, it's made with chipoltle and jalepeno. delicious.  while we were waiting, a group of the typical scottsdale bitches and bros walked in and just decided to seat themselves like they owned the fuckin place, while we kindly sat and waited. and don't even get me started on how many dirty looks my girlfriend and i got while we were waiting...ugh.  we finally got seated after 30 mins of waiting, and our waitress was very friendly and apologetic about the whole situation. we ordered the breakfast sandwhich and steak and eggs. the food didn''t come out for 45 minutes. forty five fucking minutes! the table of bitches and bros even got served way before us. and the food was COLD, and my bacon was not how i ordered it. my girlfriend had them re-make her dish, which took like 15 minutes and they STILL left off my bacon. we got offered free shots, and had several people come up to us and offer their condolences. what the fuck ever, there is no excuse for shitty service like we received.   they ended up comping our food, but we still had to pay for drinks and dessert (the cookie with peanut butter was alright). the main bartender told us he was going to get us another drink on the house, and never came back with it. the manager/owner also claimed he would be back with a card for us, and never came back with that.  it was also SO FUCKING LOUD in there (there was a football game) and they had the volume turned up so high i couldnt even hear my girlfriend speak and she was sitting right next to me.   i was looking for a cure for my hangover with steak, eggs, and a bloody mary and this place just made it that much worse and ruined my first day of the new year.  HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went today for brunch. Service was great, but food was not good at all. Ordered the chicken and biscuits. The eggs were supposed to be over easy. They were way over cooked. No runny yokes at all. Last time I was there they tried to pass a sirloin off as a ribeye."}
{"text":"Plenty of seats available so I'm guessing they were short staffed since it took 10 minutes to seat us and another 10 minutes before we had to ask if we had a server.  Appears that they have more working bussers  than they do waiters. After we finally ordered our food we waited another 45 minutes before we decided to let our server know we had to leave. She asked if we would like our food boxed up. I laughed and said well if it's ready just bring it out. She went back in to the kitchen then I noticed she walked around a different way like she was avoiding us to go ring up another check. I saw another server walk out of the kitchen with 2 plates and walked right past us that's when we left. The staff was practically oblivious to the fact we were even sitting there. They must be trained not to make eye contact. Never once did anyone acknowledge us 1st. Never once did anyone apologize for the slow service. An hour and half of my day wasted. I will never recommend this place, and will probably never be back!"}
{"text":"Horrible service both times I've attended and both times were pretty empty! I am really surprised on how bad the service is because I've been to several Southern California locations and I am very familiar with the food and service. The 1st time I went the guy was new, but had help from a trainer and still the orders were wrong and sometimes didn't see our waiter for over 20 mins, even though there were hardly any customer's. The second and last time service was again slow. Our waitress  introduced herself and we didn't see her again for over 20 mins, until I finally found another server to take our order. After finally getting our meal we didn't see our waitress until after 10 minutes after finishing our food, we didn't get a chance to order a few more drinks! I will never return to that location again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here tonight and we were very disappointed. After we got sat and ordered a drink we noticed they had birds flying around inside. When we mentioned it to the wait staff she laughed and said \"if you catch it you can keep it.\" They didn't seem to care at all. I was ready to leave after that but my husband wanted to give it a try. The table next to us left right when we got there but their dirty plates sat there for about 20 mins and they were not even busy. My husband ordered a rare steak and they served him a medium one. He isn't one to complain or make a big deal so he just ate it. One bite into our meals and the server came to ask how it was then we saw her once to refill our drinks when we were pretty much done. We had to ask the manager for a box and our check. After the manager gave us a box she came by to give us free shots. My husband and I both agreed that the shots were the best tasting thing we had and the brussel sprouts we got for an appetizer. I will say when our server was waiting on us she was friendly and the manager."}
{"text":"The bull ride is fun. Very good staff -- they had great energy and really got people involved.  The food is wretched -- worthy of a bio hazard warning.  If it were not for the great staff and fun atmospere this place would deserve 0 stars."}
{"text":"Rating is for atmosphere drinks and service, didnt have food.  Great drinks great atmosphere and great service.  Update --- went back a 2nd night, Food was pretty good, prices a little bit above average but not out of control.... I'd go back again !   By the Way, there \"out of this world\" mac & Cheese dish ain't all that... Don't order it, too expensive and average at best.  Otherwise, other food items are pretty good."}
{"text":"The huge group and I loved this place because we are out of towners... they must treat the out of towners differently because we didn't hate the place like a lot of the reviews down there. They must be pretty well off to offer us two free desserts and they did with many other parties! The place is such a fun environment.   Man I was in love with the ahi tuna wrap. It was huge, good thing I split it with someone else. I think we paid around $13 for it, and it had so much ahi in it... very worth the price!! And sooooooo good. I'm usually not a huge fan of wraps because they're kinda boring but this wrap had all of the perfect mixings and dressings in it. My god, we had a great dinner there... ordered those huge tall beer thingies as well.   I'm really glad we came in here with a huge group because we all had fun amongst ourselves and drank a lot... we also had the excitement of being on vacation. I think that if you're here to just have a nice meal, the place can seem annoying after a little while.  This sounds really weird but their cotton candy was the best cotton candy I've ever tasted. It's like strawberry flavored or something... not like other cotton candy that just tastes like plain sugar.   Two from our party rode the mechanical bull... it was kind of amusing I guess, haha. It wasn't as exciting as how you see it in movies/tv shows.  Too bad they don't let in people under 21during dinner time... this place is a restaurant.. what if the younger people wanna eat?!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience here! Came for a Sunday brunch with the hubby, we had so many choices on where to go but chose here. Big mistake! We got seated and waited like 15 minutes and never got waited on, moved to bar and service was awful there too! Ordered the chicken cilantro omelet and it was horrible! The chicken literally tasted like rotisserie chicken u would buy at Walmart. No flavoring at all just cut up and disgusting. Too many mushrooms too. The hubby ordered chicken biscuits and it was so dry! It took us forever to get our bill too and we were just so ready to leave! Never will go back again that's for sure."}
{"text":"I will give this place a 2 only because the bartender at least acknowledged us quickly and the fact that I did not stick around long. Upon sitting at the bar we noticed all glasses were plastic and hanging from the ceiling and all were very dusty, dirty and spotted. Looking around we noticed that all these poor people in this place were drinking out of these nasty glasses. I just couldn't bring myself to do it so else where we went."}
{"text":"This rock meets western themed restaurant is a fun place to enjoy a good night out! The service is top notch and the food is amazing! I highly recommend their steaks and you MUST add truffle butter and garlic shrimp. Very delicious. We were  brought over a giant pink cotton candy along with shots for free on the owner!!  Can't beat service like that!!!  Ending your night riding the bull is always the way to go..."}
{"text":"Nice decor & atmosphere. Plenty of tv's with sports. Food was good & so was the service. Cool mechanical bull. They have wi-fi. The cotton candy is a cool item."}
{"text":"Tammy, at Saddle Ranch Chop House corporation saw my review and decided to do what she could to make things better. That was awesome! All to often, corporate high ups don't get involved when the little things. It took us some time to get connected, mainly due to my work schedule (I work nights, graveyards). Since she did her best to reach out, I felt it was deserving of another try. I was offered first round of drinks and 2 appetizers for four. I decided to try them again at Bike Night on last Thursday.  It was supposed to be 4 of us. They planned on 4 of us showing up....I brought 11!!!  No problems or issues with that. They \"made\" space for all of us outside so we could enjoy all the motorcycles coming and going. Then, they honored the first round....for all of us! Ken, the GM came out to check on us several times and suggested we try the BBQ chicken nachos and the Monster Platter. I orered 2 platters and the nachos...it filled us all up! The platter was enormous! It even had BBQ ribs on it! Try it....It won't disappoint!  We ended up hanging out at Saddle Ranch the entire night, after bike night ended (around 9pm).   All in all, we had a great time. I'm told, they have a new staff since my previous reviews. Looks like they are doing everything right to make thus pave the go-to event-restaurant at Westgate!"}
{"text":"Belly up to the bar !   This is a fun spot to hang out and meet new  people.  It's not pretentious at all.  Great place to unwind and have fun.  The bar staff is very friendly and want to make sure you have a fun time.    Sit at the bar or nearby so you can catch the mechanical bull riding."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch because I heard it was good and I always thought there food was ok.  It was pretty disappointing.  For ten bucks I got eggs that were still clear and pretty raw  and cold hash browns that were raw in the middle but seared on the outside.  The service was so so.  It took a long time to receive first drink.  In fact the fruit cup came before the drinks!   The fruit cup btw tasted like it had been stored with some fish!!  What the..?!  The waitress brought free \"shots\" to make up for the bad food.  They were basically some awful juice concoction.  If I ever come here again it will for sure b only for happy hour and will sit at the bar."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. This was our first time here. We had such high hopes for this chop house experience. It's too bad that what we got was barely on par with lunch-room-cafeteria-quality food.  Everything they serve here is delivered cold.   The biscuits and honey butter: cold  The margarine (they don't have butter): cold  The prime rib: cold  The baked potato: cold and under-cooked  For a $30-$60 / plate chop house, this place absolutely sucks.   If this were a $20/plate Sizzler I would have lower expectations, but when I think chop house, I think high-end, high-quality food. This place fails in nearly every imaginable way. In fact Sizzler would have been a step up in quality and temperature.  When I mentioned my food was delivered cold, the manager offered to reheat it for me. I said it needs to be remade. Then, when round 2 of my order arrived, my steak was over cooked.   So the manager must've thought I said the steak was undercooked. I didn't. I said the entire meal was served cold. Now I understand why he wanted to refire it. He didn't take the time to actually hear my comment.   Then, oddly enough, our waitress tells me that it's not their policy to reheat food. So, why did the manager offer that? Very strange.  Ok so they don't have butter (as mentioned above). And the margarine is served ice-box cold so when you apply it to your baked potato (even if you can get one served to you hot) the potato will still be consumed cold. Ugh!  The only high point was our server Janell who was gracious and kind despite our challenges with the food.   At no time did a manager ever return to our table after I pointed out to Janell that my second steak was over cooked.  As a weird consolation prize, after telling our server we don't have room for dessert, she comped two free desserts that we didn't order and that wouldn't keep if we took them home so we left them mostly uneaten on the table. Very strange.  I get the feeling that this place is in need of a bar rescue or kitchen nightmares resuscitation. The choices they make are obviously aimed at saving money but unfortunately they are sacrificing quality."}
{"text":"Alright- the first rating would have been an 'A-OK' but they got an extra star for the eye candy bartender(s). lol. The bartenders were quick and on their game and it was nice not having to wait forever and a day for a drink with a full bar. It was a nice added touch to have a mechanical bull in the house- nothing better than watching a bunch of drunk people trying to ride a bull and keep their composure and balance . Cheers!"}
{"text":"We stopped into Saddle Ranch after we were ignored by another restaurant / bar that we stopped at, Byron made our experience awesome from the moment we sat down at the bar. The girl with the long dark braid welcomed us as we walked through the door starting off our experience with a positive note. The service was awesome, the food matched the service. We came in during happy hour and were treated to a fun filled evening. We plan on returning every chance we get. Saddle Ranch is definitely on our favorites list of places to eat. The other folks at the bar were also enjoying themselves and commented this was the rule not the exception. Bryon took awesome care of us and Gabriel, the management, checked that everything was to our liking. This is a place we will recommend to our friends!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to go....  if you want to wait 90 minutes for a platter of appetizers or 15 minutes for a beer.   This was on a day were they had maybe 15 customers too. Horrible service, warm beer and long wait times are what you will experiance.  $100 tab easily would have been more but took 15 minutes to get a bottle of beer. I would check out every other place in westgate before this place. Their solution to making us wait 90 minutes and late to our baseball game because they were to inept to get us appetizers and beers in a timely matter was to take 15% off our tab and the manager wouldn't even come speak to us."}
{"text":"The service was awful we had to argue with the waitress to even split the check. everything is hella overpriced compared to how it is priced in the menu. This is exactly why I don't come to saddle ranch anymore. why pay outrageous prices for crap beer when I can pay the same amount and the beer is of much higher quality and more unique selection in downtown Glendale (OTG or Hause Murphy) or in downtown Phoenix (Angels Trumpet). At least at those establishments they are grateful for you spending your money at those bars."}
{"text":"Bravo, Saddle Ranch, bravvooo!!!  Went here for dinner on 3.17.13. It was pretty crowded (as it was delightfully warm and a holiday), but our 3-person party was seated within a couple of minutes. We were seated on the patio and it was perfect! Good place to people watch too.  Service was friendly and prompt. We all ended up w/some sort of burger (get the \"Original\" - soooo heavenly!). I did end up taking some of my burger (due to large volume) home w/me. They have a nice recipe for their hamburgers. And, they got my order right - bloody rare! Yay!  And, the best part?? Free green apple cotton candy for dessert at our table? I love it! It was a bit sweet for my liking but I did enjoy poking holes in our spun sugar \"torch\". You guys are great! I'll be back for sure. You have won my heart!  ** NOTE: It would be awesome to include baby/wet wipes while being served the cotton candy at the end - that way you're not walking away w/a sticky mess of hands. ;)"}
{"text":"It is rare when there is not one redeeming quality to a business, but Saddleranch has achieved that level of mediocrity.  The service was poor, it took over 1/2 hour for drinks to arrive even though it wasn't busy.  The food runner was so lackadaisical it was comical.  There was something wrong with all of our entrees, with five people you must really have to work to mess something up on each plate. The manager tried to compensate by bringing us free dessert but we left after waiting over 1/2 hour for that.  For the money the quality of ingredients was very poor.  Let us all be grateful that there are other restaurants!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner, I came here for breakfast. I've been here for drinks. I had drinks with dinner and also with breakfast. Drinks and appetizers one afternoon, too. Not all over the same weekend but I'm not opposed to the Hat Trick so hey... maybe someday... but not at Saddle Ranch. I actually don't like the food here. It comes out on a humongous plate that's like a metal saucer on top of a wooden thing so you don't burn your hands. Presentation is everything but flavor, not so much.  Appetizer: shared a plate of nachos. Huge, no doubt about that. Not so much on the flavor end. Chips were kind of soggy and didn't hold up too well, or they sat in the kitchen too long before they came out to us.  Breakfast: I ordered an omelette described as \"spicy\" and I found myself asking my server for tabasco sauce and pepper. Meh. Dinner: they keep the lights on pretty low in there so it was hard to see what I was eating. I had a thick piece of cow that wasn't seasoned that well. Nothing to write home about. A huge pile of mashed potatoes. Not worth the $20-ish for the plate.   I've given it three separate chances which is more than I have given most restaurants. The reason I keep ending up in here is that it's within walking distance to me and they have those $1 (or is it $2?) drink specials on Sunday mornings. There's a lot of crazy crap on the walls and they play the Cherry Pie video every time I'm in there.  As for the nighttime scene, I've been in and out a few times... can't remember much of that, so I must have had a good time. Can't complain. I dont' mind drinking here, it's just the eating part that disappoints.   Does this one compare to the one on Sunset? Not a chance! But I'm biased in my loyalty to Los Angeles so who knows? Some who have a better time here might not have quite as much fun there, and vice versa."}
{"text":"We waited twenty minutes and never got served... they sat us down in a booth, and we saw them look at us a couple of times but no one came to our section. We really wanted to try it out but no one even asked us for drinks, this place was almost completely empty . We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Let's give the place a 3 1/2. They have good beer selections. The atmosphere is pretty laid back, I appreciate the crowd for employing the same attitude. I've never walked into a bar And immediately have a bartender greet us, \"hello ladies, what can I get for you?\" is definitely a nice change from fighting for a spot at the bar.   My friend did order something to eat, and the dish took quite a while to arrive, so they treated some cotton candy to my table. The huge thing of cotton candy is a creative marketing scam, so I can appreciate it for what it is. I would be pretty upset if I had paid $8 for it though."}
{"text":"Been to Saddle Ranch at Westgate a few times and it was okay. We went this past weekend and it was terrible, they were not busy at all and we still waited for awhile to be sat. When we finally did get to our table it was dirty. Looked around and there were several dirty tables in the restaurant, unacceptable when there were only 10 tables with customers.   We ordered appetizers that did not come out until our food did so we sent them back. I ordered a Chicken Caesar wrap that was all lettuce with a small piece of chicken same for my daughters Southwest Chicken wrap. My grandson's chicken tacos were not good he wouldn't even eat them. With the amount of money we spent for dinner will not be going back - too many other GOOD places to eat."}
{"text":"I have actually been to this place a few times and I can honestly say the only good thing about it is Happy Hour! The dinner is expensive, the service is slow, and the staff is always a hit or miss.   Today we came in for Father's Day brunch. Our waitress had no personality whatsoever. Everything was slow. It took forever to get our drinks and even longer to get our food. I would totally understand if it was busy. But it wasn't. That was the main reason we came here. It's never busy for Sunday brunch.   The food was good but the service totally ruined the meal. The other waitresses were giving out the towers of cotton candy to tables, I assume because of the holiday. Our waitress didn't even offer us one. Now our ticket was almost $150 and we had kids at our table. You would think we wouldn't have to ask but we did. And she replied with \"we don't do that for everyone.\" Then she said she would go get one.  I'm gonna stick with the Happy Hour and that's it."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to eat here after watching a hockey game. After waiting around for both the server and manager to find me a gluten free menu, I just went ahead and ordered from the regular menu.   I ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich with no bun and asked for it to be lettuce wrapped.   When my food arrives, I had a tray of sweet potato fries and a piece of burnt chicken breast with melted cheese. No lettuce, tomato or onions.   I complained to the food runner and he came back with a small amount of the above vegetables mentioned. When my server came by he told me he would be right back and came out with large pieces of lettuce, sliced tomato and onions and a pickle wedge and apologized. He also told me not to use the side of bbq sauce the kitchen had put on the plate as that had gluten in it.   I was thankful for the service of my server but I am extremely disappointed that any restaurant kitchen would send out food in this way to a customer."}
{"text":"We came here for drinks the inside was spacious with a mechanical bull people were having a great time with that.  The outside patio was nice with the fire going.  The setting was ranch and country-ish but the music was pretty much anything mostly top 40 but the dj was willing to play whatever you request.  I think the DJ was the star of the night he had great music and didn't hang out behind his turntables all night he was having fun with the crowd and engaging people in a good time."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here after watching a hockey game nearby. The food was really good - we ordered the wings and the spinach queso dip. The bartender wasn't super talkative which is kind of a turnoff for me. I don't like someone who won't shut the hell up, but I don't like bartenders that lurk around like a stalking butler either.   I saw a couple of people try their luck with the mechanical bull they have and that is always a good laugh. One of the employees decided to hop on and give the bull a ride, please let me emphasize RIDE. Small children close your eyes, and boyfriends and husbands alike, prepare to get slapped just for looking in her direction. This girl rode the bull like sea biscuit. It was like something straight out of a strip club. Now, I'm no prude, but she was downright raunchy.   Gross!"}
{"text":"I am usually not a fan of restaurants with gift shops inside of them, but I must admit I am a fan of Saddle Ranch. This is perhaps one of the best people watching locations on the west side simply for the fact that they have a mechanical bull. For some reason this device attracts women with skimpy shirts and fake boobs like bees to honey. While sipping on my ginormous long island ice tea, I could not help but utterly enjoy watching people get tossed from the bull, in many instances it was pure comedy. I have yet to eat here but my parents have on two occasions and have had wonderful experiences. The first time they went there they had to wait for a table and the manager walked them over to the bar and bought them a drink. The manager obviously understood that a free bloody mary was the way to my mother's heart and a sure fire way to win repeat business."}
{"text":"Say what you want about this touristy place. They treat locals like gold. yeah, food is a bit expensive but everything is HIGH END. Burgers were awesome, if overpriced by three dollars or so. The hot wings had some BBQ sauce mixed into the hot sauce, which is a pet peeve of mine. The ribs were tender and smokey. Steak was also good here, everything is good. I know tourists want that \"cowboy touch\" but I like hot wings unadulterated, The bartender was attentive and fun and the manager bought us shots \"just because\". We had a great time and all the memorabilia gives you something to focus on when the shots start to hit. Great place to enjoy, again.. on payday."}
{"text":"Went here tonight. Yes, I know it's a weekend at Westgate, and expected them to be busy. There wasn't a long wait to get sat. Took us a little while to get our drinks out, and then we ordered our food. It took over an hour to get our food out to us, our server she had only checked on us a couple of times, and didn't after the bread sticks, despite the fact that she saw me looking over at her several times during the meal. About 50 minutes after waiting, I went to go look for her to ask where our food had went, couldn't find her. I did see her as well as other servers hanging out with other tables. The table next to us even had to get their own silverware after the food had been brought out. I ended up walking out, paying for my drink and not even getting out food. I had to go somewhere else to eat completely. The server never came over to apologize about our wait, no manager, no other servers came to check up on us after the biscuits were brought out.I even offered to pay for my drink, which she took a while to bring out the check for that, keeping me their angry even longer.It seems like they are very selective about who they serve, saw a lot of girls hanging out with the guys at the tables while other tables were waiting.  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE service..I couldn't even find a manager to complain to."}
{"text":"We went here last night after the football game and it was packed of course which was to be expected. We got seated fairly quickly though. A server came around for our drink orders. All was good until we had to ask for waters three times. The wings weren't that great. The drinks were over priced for what they were and the service just wasn't that good. The atmosphere was nice though."}
{"text":"Refused to call me a cab because I had a phone."}
{"text":"Saddle Ranch can be fun...It can also be frustrating. I've been to Saddle for lunch a number of times, and if you're in a group of more than 4, plan for a 2 hour lunch extravaganza. It's that slow.   There are some good menu options. I think their Cajun burger is good, I've had breakfast there once that I thought was alright, and they offer cheap/bottomless bloody mary's or mimosas during breakfast and lunch. I think the food is overpriced, and the plates they serve on are so unnecessarily, comically large that it doesn't leave much room on your table for the essentials like napkins and silverware. My guess is that they want you to have that \"outdoor cookin' on giant wooden plates\" kind of experience, which would make sense if they weren't in the heart of Old Town...Seeing a Ferrari packed with cougars driving by doesn't scream \"outdoor cookin'\".   I rode the bull here one night, and while I don't really remember it, apparently it was hilarious. If I did things like that more often, I might rate Saddle a lot higher. Unfortunately, I can only go on what I know, which is typically a lunch with OK food and service that takes twice as long as it should. The weirdest part to me is that the service for a group of 5+ is slow even when the restaurant looks otherwise empty. I kept giving Saddle another chance (8 chances in total, apparently), but I kept getting disappointed.  If you've got time to kill, Saddle is an OK lunch option. If you've got an hour for lunch, you're better off going elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is the first time we took our daughter for brunch and it was such a different place, of course, then the nighttime or happy hour. The music was quieter, the food was better looking, and tasted better. I will totally do brunch again! My daughter loved it! My only reason for not giving 5 was because the service was just okay, we needed drinks and waited forever. Also their prices are very high for a brunch."}
{"text":"We walked in at 7:15pm and immediately let the waitress know if she thought we'd be okay for a 8pm show at Stir Crazy Comedy Club. She said she'll make sure we make it! Sure enough we had steak and ribs that were awesome and a drink that was amazing. We have to say she earned a tip! We were at the comedy doors at 7:58pm!  Perfect!  We had a perfect night! From the beginning to end! Thank u .... i think her name was Megan. She made our date night out so nice to get someone that gets it! Love that! Anyone else would have started to make up excuses she didn't she was very positive and made it perfect!"}
{"text":"Not as good as the one in Hollywood or Studio City, CA but still fun. I was there to party for MNF on a Sunday with fellow Niner fans. Strong drinks. Great time."}
{"text":"This is the second time we have tried this place, trying to give it a second chance.  NEVER AGAIN :-/  The food is bad and the service sucked :-(  I am actually normally nice and try to be nice in my comments but I have nothing positive to say about this place. The only positive is that I will never have to eat there again :-)"}
{"text":"I've been here several times now and I want to give them a higher rating because there's some things I really like here but there's others that keep me from doing so with a clear conscience.  A friend and I planned on meeting for lunch today and we were going to go to RnR but there was a 2 hour wait for a table, uhhhhh, no thanks.  We had driven past Saddle Ranch and saw that it wasn't too busy and figured we could get seated a little quicker.  We walked up and were greeted right away (love that) and the host told us it would take him a couple minutes to get a table cleared for us so he walked us to the bar and said our first drink was on him.  I won't argue about that!  A couple minutes later he came back and walked us to our table and gave us our menus.  From greeting to seating he was super friendly, helpful and joking around with us, definitely my favorite part of the experience.  However; after we were seated we waited, and waited, and waited some more, all the while watching multiple servers walk by, some just standing around looking bored.  We finally got someone to come over after staring obnoxiously to get her attention.  She was nice but not anywhere near as friendly as the host who originally greeted us.  We each ordered a mimosa as they're only $1.99 with the order of a meal before 3pm.  Then I ordered the Fish Tacos and my friend ordered the Chicken Strips buffalo style with a side of the sweet potato fries.  Now, the restaurant wasn't super busy, the inside section didn't have very many tables occupied and the patio was about 75% full but nothing outrageous but lo and behold we had a long wait for our food AND drinks.  I could understand the food maybe taking a bit longer but come on, it takes 30 seconds to pour juice and champagne into a glass and the mimosas came out at the same time as the food.  We probably would have ordered more drinks and stayed longer to just hang out if we thought we would get them within a decent amount of time but that just wasn't going to happen today.  As for the food my Fish Tacos were interesting.  The flavor was just okay and I thought it was weird that the fish was in almost cube like shapes instead of just having a filet in the tortillas like I was expecting.  The chicken strips were pretty good but it's hard to mess those up.  My favorite was the sweet potato fries.  They were perfectly cooked, had a great flavor and came with a sweet dipping sauce that was amazing.  So the bottom line is that I love the atmosphere, the selectively awesome service and the fact that a lot of the time you'll get free drinks/shots/cotton candy BUT I can't give 5 or even 4 stars due to the fact that service is very slow, the serving staff isn't great and the food is average.  If on another occasion these things improve then I'll update my rating but this is all I can give them for now."}
{"text":"It was my first visit. Stopped in sat at the bar and my life was changed by a bartender named \"Rosalia\". She made a wonderful Bloody Mary and her suggestions for lunch were spot on. If you're every in Glendale AZ stop by to visit Rosalia, you won't regret it. Also, the food was great!"}
{"text":"Some of the best service I have experienced.  Arrived at the restaurant and there wasn't a table available, because they were busy.  The manager bought my group a round of drinks and by the time the drinks were ready so was a table.   Dinner was great and then much to our surprise the manager had sent a free desert for our very brief wait.  They know how to take care of their customers.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I would have given this place five stars, but...  I went with a large group of friends while we were in town for Spring Training (Go Giants!).  I felt the service was great.  Our waitress made sure our drinks were never empty and the food arrived quickly after ordering it.  With a group of seven of us eating, nobody had complaints, which is rare.  Now for drinks...  I had the S.R.A.M.F.  I had to get it because I had no clue what the acronym would stand for.  Our waitress quickly filled me in: Saddle Ranch Adios Mother Fucker.  Now who can pass up a drink with a name like that?!?!  The drinks were good...typical prices for a bar.  Food was reasonably priced as well.  Oh yeah,  I also got a kickass pirate cowboy hat for only $29.99.  Am I a tourist?  Hell yeah!  Did the hat kick ass anyway?  Absolutely.  Now, for the -1* part.  The Saddle Ranch had a mechanical bull riding contest.  It looked like fun, but I wasn't drunk enough yet.  So...two friends of one of my friends on the trip decided to jump on the bull.  The first one on ended up dislocating her left thumb.  She got off the bull and asked the staff to help her put it back in place.  They refused.  She ultimately had to ask her friend to put it back in its socket.  That was gross.  At any rate, the bar staff were less than helpful.  She was half joking about it at the bar and the bartender said some rude crap to her.    It's a shame, because we had an otherwise excellent time at that spot.  I'll probably go back next year when we're in town for Spring Training, so until then this review stands.  If I go back, I'll update it then."}
{"text":"Let's start off with Saturday morning...  My boyfriend and I are from out of town and looked up breakfast places around us, we decided to try out saddle ranch.  We got there around 9 or so and the place looked deserted. (Website said opened at 9)  So I waited until 9:10 or so to call and see what was going on.  The lady in the phone was super sweet and said she'd be down soon to let us in.  She came down 5 mins later to let us know the hour for opening changed to 10. Thanked us and left.   So we said screw it and ate somewhere else.   We came back Saturday night around 10ish pm to have a quick bite to eat and drink.  The place was like a straight party zone. Music was so loud you have to yell to hear anything.   We walked in and waited for someone to come up to us for seating (sign said wait for host for seating) and this guy came up to check out ID. Didn't say anything and walked back to the table where you can buy shirts and stuff... so we finally when up to one of the waitresses and got a table.   We were able to order pretty quickly and food didn't take to long... but the food is not worth it. We got the club wrap and jalapeño Mac and cheese. The wrap was dry and horrible.... I could barely finish half of it. The Mac and cheese was alright.  We didn't see our waitress much after that.. which I understand since it was so busy.... but jesus the foods expensive.    By the way nothing about this place was country, besides the decorations and the bull you can ride. It's a straight pop club at night .. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!!!   I will not be returning that's for sure"}
{"text":"We were seated at a dirty table, and then waited 15 minutes to put in our drink order. The waitress was more interested in talking with her friends that were dining in the establishment than taking our order. We both ordered the prime rib, and it took forever to come out. The meat was bland, unseasoned and tasted like it had been boiled. It then took our waitress an additional 30 minutes to give us our check and an additional 15 minutes to run our card. This place may be great for drinking and 20-somethings on a Friday night, but the service blows and the food is disgusting."}
{"text":"Yell at me, call me names, beat me up, just PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't make me go back to Saddle Ranch!!  Ick from beginning to end.    I made the mistake of bringing a couple out of town buyers here last night, a Monday mind you, thinking it would be fun and kitchy.  You know, they could watch a couple lushes get on the bull and made fools of themselves and fall off, rustic cowboy atmosphere, good enough for entertaining out of towners anyways.  Oh how wrong was I??  Just my luck it was their 1 year anniversary party and the placed was packed.  And packed with the worst kind of people.  It looked like a Real World casting call had thrown up all over the bar.  Skanky, underage girls literally falling over chairs, and being annoyingly in the way all the time.  Oh, and I'm pretty sure that all the steroids ever injected in AZ were in that bar too.  And get this, they were all wearing crystals on their shirts...puke.  It took FOREVER to get served at the bar which we obviously didn't stay at long because my clients wanted to get the hell out of there ASAP.  The only reason in gets any stars at all is because I cannot entirely turn my back on any place that serves cotton candy.  That would be the 5 year old in me : )"}
{"text":"Unlimited Mimosas, Bull Riding, delicious breakfast burritos! Scottsdale has some really great places to eat!! And that's a compliment coming from a NJ/NYC girl!"}
{"text":"If I can give this place a zero I would!!!! Made reservation for Christmas Day for 3 pm and didn't get seated till shortly after 4pm. The female manager had little customer service, if she really hates her job that much she shouldn't work in a place that needs good public relations. I will never go there again"}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly.  This is pretty much a bar with decent bar food.  Lots of loud drunk people.  Watching ppl on the mechanical bull was very entertaining.  Don't go here for a quiet dinner and conversation - go here to watch drunk yell over the loud music."}
{"text":"Do not eat here if you have Celiac Disease.  I ordered explicitly asking for gluten free options. I ordered the Cajon burger with no bun and the seasoned veggies  Initially everyone else at my table was served, and I had to wait because they had put the bin on my burger and had to record it.  They did comp me a drink for having to wait. When I finally got my meal, I was excited. I began to eat and halfway through  I found a pasta noodle in my veggies. I got a profuse apology from the manager and the chef.   Ughhh...  they did comp my meal, but who knows if I'll get sick."}
{"text":"Went here on a Cardinals (v Steelers) game day and it was plum-packed to the gills.  Even arriving 3 hours before game time wasn't enough to grab a table.  As a result, we \"drank\" our breakfast-- who could complain about that?  Nonetheless, good atmosphere, plenty of TVs with every game being played -- not a bad way to tailgate in some place other than the parking lot!"}
{"text":"Excellent bar service ever. Great place after a Coyotes game."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! We started with nachos. I love nachos! They were very tasty, the beans and cheese were good. The rib eye was done to perfection and the veggies were great! Our server was fabulous, very attentive! Scott, came back so many times that wee never needed anything!"}
{"text":"I came by for dinner actually the other day and I have to say that the food was really good.  I had the baby back ribs and they fell right off the bone and BBQ was very sweet and flavorful.  I also got the sweet potato casserole which is practically desert, very sweet.  My friend ordered the ribeye which looked good for the whole 5 minutes before it was digesting in my friends gut.  His wife had the chili and it came in a gigantic kettle looking bowl and she loved it.  The manager Jason came by our table and checked on us and was kind enough to send us a complimentary cotton candy desert that comes in the gigantic martini glass.  I should have taken a picture but I'm sure one will pop up soon.  I've been here many times in the past for late night drinking and love the atmosphere, the bull riding, and of course it is a good size crowd for the west valley.  I will go back now just for food, especially now that I know they serve breakfast!  Wow, does this place ever close?"}
{"text":"A good friend recommended Saddlle Ranch Chop House as the place to bring our famiy of nine.  We arrived and were seated at a table too small for the nine of us so we asked for a larger table and were refused with \"we can't do that.\"  Since we've enjoyed other restaurant recommendations from our friend we chose to be gracious to the establishment rather than have them be gracious to us, the paying customers.  So we were squeezed into a small table which became even smaller when our food arrived and the larger than life plates made it impossible for us to fit our plates comfortably in front of us.  One of our meals was forgotten about for a lengthy period of time.  Our young brunette waitress gets applause for breaking a record for the number of apologies made to a cuistomer throughout the meal.  The ambiance is fun, but we were so disappointed.  The hash iin a place called \"Saddle Ranch Chop House\" could be more of a signature dish with something to set it apart from other places of less renown.  This was a family birthday celebration for us, our grown kids and grandkids and we were made to feel that the waitress and management was doing us a favor by allowiing us to dine there at all.  It would have taken less than five minutes for them to push tables together to accomodate us.  The place was not crowded.  We felt the prices for the food were reasonable and wish that the customer service was commensurate.  Our late entree was comped.  It was a nice gesture however we were still cramped and made to fee that we should either take what we were given in terms of seating or just hit the road.  We might consider going again with a smaller group but then again....first impressions.....hmmmm....We were a bit embarrassed to have brought our grown kids at all given how little we seemed to matter.  Apologies from a young server is not customer service."}
{"text":"Gotta love it! Good service, good fun , big food!  Cant go wrong!"}
{"text":"Day drinking, superbowl party, night club, birthdays, couples bull riding anything you want to do you can do it here.   We ended up here somehow, and instantly fell for the joint. Open everyday food until two! The service is the best in the state, no question. They are so full of fun , the managers walk by checking on you even wait staff that is not yours seem to help out by grabbing you another drink or clearing the table.  Portions on food are awesome but dont let that fool you on quality because I have never had anything I wouldnt want to eat forever on a desert island. The BBQ chicken nachos I have actually gone back 3 times in one day for!!  They almost always bring the table a complimentary round!!   NOTHING BEATS it!  Good for anyonekids during the day, familys, college kids. Snotty dressy club girls will stll have a good time , its nice to stop in for a drink before the clubs or after the clubs for another round and sme food!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, especially for happy hour. Can be a bit pricey outside happy hour but still great food (steaks). The servers are very attentive and friendly. Can get pretty loud and crowded on the weekend nights. Did I mention happy hour yet? Or breakfast? go for breakfast, ask to be seated with Teresa... she is awesome. Byron and James at the bar during the week for happy hour; can't go wrong. Did I mention their awesome happy hour yet? :)"}
{"text":"Good food and good service.    If you're not getting the happy hour prices, you are overpaying."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, a little overpriced. Would eat here again. The bull riding is entertaining. Free WiFi. Lots of hot waitresses to look at."}
{"text":"I went to Saddle Ranch with 5 people before the Coyote game.  They should be embarrassed with the garbage they served.  We ordered  an appetizer the Monster I believe it's called and it looked like a monster.  Awful to say at best.   For our meal I had a burger that was dry and tasteless and a few others ordered the BBQ Chicken Sandwich which they said was dry and no good.  My son ordered the Chicken tenders and he ate one.  How this place is still in business is a shock.  We will never be back."}
{"text":"Good time! I have only been here twice. the first time was a disaster! we asked for medium burgers and got rare. Knowing what its like to send things back and have fear they (the kitchen staff at ANY place are going to do something to it) so we just ate the sides and payed for the burger bite later. :( yuck..   The second time we went IT WAS AWESOME we told them how the first experiance was and they apologized for that and gave us a free dissert. not the usual cotton candy, but a baked cookie (which was not cooked.. how ironic) we said thanks and let them know the rest of the meal was fantastic!  This is one of those places it would be perfect for a sandwich and BEERS. the ambiance is great. the service is awesome, but go here for the drinks.. and the bull riding!"}
{"text":"Food is OK, I have only tried appetizers but from what i can see they do serve a average steak.  I usually attend Saddle Ranch for the night life.  The bull riding, loud country music, and short skirts keep this place Pippin off most weekends.  It is fun place to come to to kick back and not have to worry about long lines to get in and cover  charges.  I wish they would add a dance floor, which would help with keeping women there longer.  That is really my only complaint.  Good looking women are there every night.  Good place to party, Not great."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and service in the morning great way to start the day the biscuits and gravy with sausage was really good and some of the waitresses have some big titties not a bad way to get started"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying the 4th star I'm giving this place is based on when I used to come here (we're talking over 2 yrs ago) every now and then for breakfast or lunch when I was still living in AZ. I just glanced over the menu and it pretty much looks the same, so I'm assuming the food is just as good (breakfast and lunch-wise...not sure about dinner). I used to love the breakfast burritos here and they used to have this FABULOUS lunch special I'm not sure if they offer anymore ($3.99 for half a wrap, salad or soup AND a soda!).   This review is mostly for Saddle Ranch as a bar/night club (which is more like 3 stars). As far as I'm concerned this place is A-Ok. It's not my favorite place to go to in Scottsdale, but you can certainly do much worst. I was just in Scottsdale recently visiting family & friends and popped in here for a couple drinks on a Friday night and it was pretty much just as I remembered it.   The one thing I really like about this place is that it's big! The patio is large, there's a lot of seating around the bar, there's booths, and there's an upstairs with plenty of tables. It's no secret that Scottsdale is full of douchebags so it's nice to know if you're sitting/standing near one (or several) there's plenty of places within the same bar you can relocate to.   To be honest, besides the mechanical bull (which I've never been on) there's nothing about Saddle Ranch (for better or for worst) that really stands out for me and that's not necessarily a bad thing. The crowd is often pretty mixed (douches, cougars, bachelorette parties, ASU students, middle-aged couples having a \"night out,\" etc...). I can't think of any particular drink specials this place offers, but the vodka/soda's I had the last time I was here were pretty strong, so that's good!   If you're someone who's anti-Scottsdale you probably won't like this place. If you're someone who wants the most Scottsdale-like experience possible there are places more douchey than this. If you're in Old Town, like alcohol (who doesn't?) and doesn't mind a large mix of people Saddle Ranch is a pretty good spot!"}
{"text":"I have been here about 10 times. I think it is getting better and better. Tonight we had the monster platter, southwest wrap, and Cajun hamburger it was all great. We had the cotton candy and skillet cookie, they were sooooo good. They took great care of us and comped the cotton candy. Fun place for the kids too!"}
{"text":"We stopped in last nite to get a few drinks. Its not a country bar at all. No country music or atmosphere. I ordered 2 mixed drinks and they were $23 for a round. Where do you get off charging those prices. We will never be back."}
{"text":"This place is awful. We were here with two other friends and the service was awful. The guy completely forgot about one order and  never checked in on us for about 30 mins. When we finally asked where my boyfriends tacos were he said they ran out of tortillas. They weren't even going to tell him. Because we were waiting for his entree the rest of ours got cold. I ate half of my turkey burger and it was so salty. Then my friend ordered a coors light and he brought us a blue moon. He then took the blue moon away when we corrected him. He then said we can have one on the house and brought us the old beer back. Dirty plates were left on our table the entire time and he never refilled our drinks. He then said he took the tacos off the bill. When I looked at the bill it only took $5 dollars off the $10 worth of tacos. This server was awful and they took no pride in customer service."}
{"text":"I have to say, I really like this place.  I have been here twice within the past two weeks, and both times were enjoyable.  The first time we went strictly for drinks.  Four of us shared the beer tower - 3 Liters of domestic beer served in a huge clear tower with a tap right on your table.  Talk about an attention getter.  It definitely isn't what you want to drink if you are trying to be inconspicuous, plus your beer can get warm if you don't drink fast enough.  But if you order one of those you can't say you're there just for a quick drink...  There was also a great girl walking around on the patio singing songs which was cute and pretty cool, I liked it.  People were riding the bull and having a good time and it was a good atmosphere.  Pretty laid back and chill - it was a Wednesday night.  I went back again for a Sunday brunch and was blown away at the $2 mimosas and bloody mary's.  All different types and they are cheap enough that you can try them all - very impressed.  However, if you are ordering food, make sure you haven't eaten in a day or can split with someone.  The portions are the biggest I've ever seen.  I'm not kidding.  They bring out a PLATTER for each person.  My omelette probably had 10 eggs in eat.  I only ate a few bites.  Overall, its a cool place with a cool vibe and I would recommend it just for the drink specials."}
{"text":"The bulls always fun, the drinks are reasonably priced. The foods typical bar food, not great but a lot of it at semi reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Each time we have been to this restaurant prior to a coyotes game we have been double charged. The second charge usually shows up a day after the first. I understand them needing to verify the card for a$1 due to those who may walk out without paying. This past weekend when the waitress (who was very nice) asked for the card, we said sure no problem, but don't double charge kind of as a joke. Well guess what last night there was a double charge hit the card. Two drinks should not cost $70.00. If this only happened once, we would blow it off but this has been twice now. We will not be returning.  It is a shame because the wings and drinks are very good but it is not worth the hassle of disputing the charges."}
{"text":"There are a lot of different aspects to review here.   I would have to say the food is mediocre. Its not bad but also not anything amazingly delicious. You would expect better taste being in Old Town Scottsdale.  I would have to recommend Saddle Ranch for a late night destination. Drunk people riding the mechanical bull. There are always good looking people around. It is a ton of fun if you bring a group of friends. The usual drink special is 50% off your second cocktail shot. Aka, make your drink a double, and that second shot is half off. The upstairs bar is a secret spot I usually end up at. Little less crowded and great place to people watch from the balcony. The music videos playing on the flat screens all around the bar is pretty cool.  Overall, relaxing laid-back place to drink late at night."}
{"text":"What a great place. We (family of three) went on a Sunday afternoon. What a fun place, great food, friendly staff. The manager was there, she let my son sit on the michanical bull. fun. fun. fun"}
{"text":"I'm changing my review by one star as I did get a call from their Corporate office. Tami was very polite and concerned with our experience. After our next visit at this location I will update this review accordingly."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a Friday during happy hour.  I ordered one of their \"specialty drinks\" , b/c those were half off...had their Gold Rush, which is a margarita.  I didn't like it b/c it tasted like orange.  So it seems like they add orange juice to their margaritas :thumbs down:  The service was pretty quick.  Their appetizers were half off also so I ordered their BBQ ribs-those were sooooooo good!  They have a lil spice to them.  I would go back here to eat, but maybe order a different cocktail."}
{"text":"Blah.  My family and I went for dinner here on Sunday night.  The place was fairly dead, but the staff seemed like they were in a panic.  Food was very bland.  I had the hollywood burger.  Nothing special about it and my fries were fairly cold.  Service was absolutely awful.  They just flat out forgot about us a few times.    Won't be back next time I'm in AZ."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever visiting Phoenix and this place was BY FAR my favorite place to visit! Our bartender Rosalia was the BEST bartender I have ever had! She made sure we never went without anything! She went above and beyond anyone I have ever seen in the business. She is the reason I will be back and for having a such an awesome experience! We were there 3 times in one day because we were taken such good care of! I highly recommend this place...the food and drinks were awesome but the service was top notch! You won't be disappointed! Cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying me giving this place 4-stars means it's good....because it's at Westgate and I'm not a huge fan of that scene.  First off, I do think they have a few too many hostesses (never seen a man host), which is fine by me but it's almost a congregation at the entrance.  It's a big bar/restaurant so even on busy days you can usually get a table or a seat at one of the bars.  There's two bars outside which are easily accessible, a lot of tables on the patio that wraps around the front and side of the restaurant, and a couple fire pits that are burning the midnight oil (till 4am on weekends, I do believe).     The food is great.  Get the wings, ribs, or BBQ burger and you won't be disappointed.  Eat at the bar because this place, hands down, has the best looking bartenders at Westgate.  At least the times that I've been here, they have been S-M-O-K-I-N-G HOT!  There's also a bull, which makes this place even better.  For $3 you can sign your life away, the can avoid a lawsuit if you get bucked into the pond, and you can try hold on while they throw you around.  It's fun to watch because you can see a 300 pound man fall off in 4-seconds but a 90-pound woman hold on for a minute....they know what they're doing.  I'd recommend trying it out on the weekdays for lunch if you're going for food, night time if you're going to try and \"work your game\" or Saturday nights if you're into the whole \"TAP OUT and AFFLICTION\" scene....which I am definately NOT A FAN OF.  Saturdays can get real annoying if you're not trying to be somebody and don't eat creatine and protein powder for your pre-dinner appetizer.    But, that's not just Saddle Ranch, that's all of Westgate on the weekends so don't hold it against them.  I'd definately check it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Had a good time chilling here with friends, I got a big ass salad and it stuffed me. The bartender was very chatty, I didn't catch his name, but he made us a couple of gummy bear shots that were to die for."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic brunch with some friends here. Great service and food. The manager came out after our meal and gave us the cotton candy tower on the house."}
{"text":"A group of about 15 of us went there on a Sunday night, and had a great time!  The food was good.  Kind of average, but satisfying.  I ordered the french dip, and it was huge!  I also enjoyed the huge carafe of Gold Rush (liquid courage for the mechanical bull).  The drink was a little syrupy and sweet, but definitely did the trick.  I mean, I did get on that bull...!  Needless to say, I quickly fell- but my friend Amy (also a first time rider) won the competition!  Despite my bruised face and ego, I had a great time at the Saddle Ranch. I would definitely come back if I ever found myself in Scottsdale again.  But I'll probably stay off the bull...I mean, save a horse and just ride a cowboy."}
{"text":"We decided to try Saddle Ranch yesterday(Sunday May, 24th) with some friends who had been there before and said the food is good.  We arrived about 5:15.  There were 7 of us(4 adults, 3 children).  We went up to the hostess station, and told them there we had 7 people.  This is where it all started to unravel...I'm thinking 7 must be an unlucky number for this establishment, or they never had a party of 7 show up before, or they were just that unorganized and incompetent.    We were asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside, we chose inside.  after about 5 minutes of looking around, staring at each other, and trying to figure out what to do; they managed to find us a table by the bull ring.  This shouldn't have been a tough thing to accomplish; the restaurant was 80-90% empty(with this level of incompetence I could see why).  Well, with all the empty tables in the place, they sit us next to the loud, obnoxious, drunk table shared by 2 couples who thought it was okay to cuss like sailors in front of small kids.  Back to the hostess stand we go(only about 25 feet away).  We tell them the problem, and ask for another table.  Once again we are asked if we would like to sit outside, our answer is still the same, no.  Well, they claimed they couldn't seat us inside because they had reservations and all the other tables inside were reserved.  I found this hard to believe, since the place was almost empty, and there were 3-4 staff just milling around at the hostess station.  One staff member(manager?) did offer to go over to the table and ask those patrons to watch there language, but would not seat us at another indoor table.  We declined, for obvious reasons.  I did notice the General Manager and the Head Chef had their names on the door of the restaurant, and I wish i would have either taken a photo or copied down the names so I could contact them directly.  My guess is that some serious training/re-training needs to occur if this restaurant will remain in business at this location.  I understand that people come to a bar/restaurant to drink and have a good time.  I also understand that some people don't care how they act and don't care who's around when they have been drinking.  I do think that either a hostess, or manager would have the common sense not to sit 2 families with children next to a bunch of drunken louts in a restaurant that is 80-90% empty.    Hint to management, don't turn down 7 paying customers that walk in to an almost empty restaurant because you claim to have \"reservations\" for every other table in the restaurant.  Keep the customer that is already there, and let them have another table.  By the time all the customers with reservations show up, the drunks should either be gone or maybe passed out.  I will add, that we went to another restaurant in Westgate, and when we walked back by Saddle Ranch, they were not that much busier than they were an hour before.  This has to be the most incompetent group of employees at any restaurant in Arizona."}
{"text":"We used to frequent Saddle Ranch when there was a Scottsdale location. We loved the food there. The food at this one wasnt as good as we remembered it. Everything was just ok. Too many other options to eat in that area to settle for just ok"}
{"text":"Many issues here. It took nearly 20 min to just get a drink. Then the 2nd drink took just as long and we informed we had plans in an hour before sitting down. Small things so far... But it gets worse  They charged me for drinks I didn't order. They spilled beer on my dinner.   When I informed them of the over charge They ran my card twice!!!   As we got up they spilled catchup all over my wife's back and hair and on my expensive cowboy boots.   When we told manager he said there is nothing he could do to make us leave happy.   He gave us a business card and said come visit again when he isn't busy :/   It's an hour drive each way for us :(  Don't do it. To many other nearby choices."}
{"text":"I recently spent a week chilling in the oasis of the desert that is Scottsdale, AZ and I actually visited this place more than once.  It's a great place when its packed and girls are hopping up on the Bull getting crazy.  Its also an AWESOME spot for late night grub.  Go there on a weeknight or Sunday at 1 AM after a day of golfing and boozing and this is the place to top it off.  Steak and Eggs platter is ridiculous and I thought the steak was better than most $50 ones at 'high end' places.  Granted, I was probably going to like LOTS of food at this hour but the portions are crazy big and the bartenders are cool and chill, unlike other old town spots.  All in all it goes good with breakfast, lunch, dinner, and 4th meal.  Oh yeah, and they have a bull.  $3/ride but don't be that guy who gets on all drunk and gets booed off.  You are in old town and if you are looking to get laid riding the bull has a better chance of getting you laughed at later in the night."}
{"text":"Sad attempt at a breakfast.. They got off to a good start with nicely baked muffins, but blew it up with re-heated potatoes, and microwaved eggs..  I do not recommend, unless you plan to have lots of cocktails before your food arrives."}
{"text":"Rosalia was the best. She tended bar , reviewed the food waited tables and we had a great conversation. I too am from MA and it was great hearing we were from the same area. This place has everything and the food was so fresh."}
{"text":"HONESTLY SOME TIMES YOU WISHED YOU LOOK AT YELP FIRST.  The best advice is to avoid this tourist trap at Westgate.  We were there several weeks ago for lunch, the service, food, and experence was just aweful.  Waited almost an hour for our food to arrive, it was warm not hot, nothing special, and people who came in after us got their food first.  Finally a young lady came over said she was the manager on duty, appoligise for the negative experence.  Gave us her card, ssaid something about asking for her, and said to please try Saddle Ranch Chop House again.  Saddle Ranch is not a cheap greasy spoon, but honestly we have had better service & food at the Waffel House on the interstate than this place.  Will not return as I see no reason to hope aything changes in the future.  Now after the fact I look at Saddle Ranch's YELP Reviews, and should have seen all the bad reviews, and avoided the place.  YUCK."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch on the weekends. Also great for a couple of drinks before a hockey game!  If there are people on the mechanical bull, it is always entertaining!"}
{"text":"We went to the Saddle Ranch Chop House for my sister's 21st birthday.  It was a Monday night so it wasn't busy.  They gave us an arm band to get a discount on food the following day, which was cool.    The nachos we ordered were HUGE(!) and yummy.    Because it was my sister's birthday, they gave her free cotton candy.  Cotton Candy?!  I thought the same thing.  It was pretty awesome though.    This place has a nice patio with a bar outside for smokers.  They have a mechanical bull and that was fun to watch.  Love the ambiance here.  Nice place all around."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends and wasn't sure what to expect given I have not been here for many years. We got seated next to the mechanical bull which is always exciting!! It was Happy Hour, appetizers and drinks were half off. My drink was great except when given to me it was covered in sticky stuff. After cleaning the outside it was much better. Everyone liked their food/drinks and the service was mediocre. This place is a-ok but it is not on my top lists of places at westgate.   Oh and they give little kids balloons that they attach to their arms. I swear that is the best idea every because they are like little drunk people and it is way easier to catch them when you see a floating balloon around!"}
{"text":"The Food was pretty good. The thing that was Crazy was the prices I understand they are at a prime location but $12.50 for 6 buffalo wings, um yea not right. What saved this was our waitress, we had 7 people and 3 kids she worked really hard to accommodate all our little issues extra ranch, more water that kind of stuff. She also got the manager involved and he gave us an extra plate of wings plus a hamburger. The other thing was I ordered extra onion rings and only got 6- 7 so for these prices I was expecting a good portion. But all n all the service was really good and the manager did the right thing. The food was really good. So, I guess the real problem was small portions compared to the price."}
{"text":"First time eating there.  Went in on a Friday morning for breakfast. Not many people inside so a little skeptical. I had the veggie omelette which was excellent. My husband had the pancake combo which he really enjoyed.  The peppered bacon was excellent. We'll be back before we leave Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Tried to not let the obnoxious Seahawk fans ruin the experience but the food and service did the job.  We stopped in for a drink and some apps the Friday night before the big game.  Let see, buffalo wings - salty, overcooked,  Nachos - I could have opened a bag of Doritos and done better."}
{"text":"The food was good...but the service was miserable!  We waited almost an hour for our food.  Everything took forever, even receiving and paying our check.  I will never be back to this place!"}
{"text":"This place has the most bland food I have had in a very long time, prices are insanely high and the service blows! Don't waste your money or time!"}
{"text":"I used to love coming here,  what a horrible experience this time.  I'll never come back,  the service was horrible, shouldn't take 10 minutes to track down a server at 3 on a Monday,  and the over priced food was mediocre at best.  What a shame, no wonder they're closing down left and right."}
{"text":"Although I wasn't a huge fan of my fish tacos....we did order a lot of food off the menu and I tried a bunch of stuff that was really good.  The ribs and sliders we great.  The chili was pretty good too.  Nice \"modern/western vibe\", outdoor seating and they have a mechanical bull!  We ended our dinner with a HUGE ball of cotton candy!  Plus Old Town Scottsdale is pretty cool"}
{"text":"Not sure why the mediocre reviews. First time here, large group, and we loved it. Gotta love the western decor and ambiance. The staff was AWESOME, especially the young woman who operated the bull for us, KJ our server extraordinaire and the manager who kept checking in on us. The bull ride was a ton of fun. The outdoor patio was shaded and comfortable and overlooked the water fountain in the plaza. I was slightly disappointed that the breakfast/egg menu didn't go past 11 am on a Sunday, but our lunch food was all really good. Alcoholic beverages were huge and delicious and the bread basked before lunch, go carefully because you can really get filled up. We don't live nearby so this was a special drive for us to try it and we are all super excited to go back soon."}
{"text":"I don't know if it is always this way (one WOULD have to assume it is) but I swear to god they were doing a casting call for the VH1 show \"Tool Academy\" the night I went here.   After waiting in line for twenty minutes and going through a Fort Knox age verification process I walk into the bar and see a gigantic circle five guys deep around a mechanical bull. I threw up in my mouth. A lot.   If you are a guy looking to watch sleazy, low confidence drunk chicks hump a bull or if you are a sleazy, low confidence drunk chick, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"We walked all over Westgate hoping to get in somewhere before the Ed Sheeran concert and finally settled on Saddle Ranch. We walked into the bar and were immediately greeted by Byron, who was on top of his game and very friendly! The restaurant was incredibly busy and he still checked on us very frequently and gave great service. A breath of fresh air in a busy and stressful situation! I wrote this review before even leaving the bar because he was so great! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This is Westgate, so ample security is to be expected. But when I approached the entrance on a happenin' Saturday night, this was taken to new heights. The guy was nice enough when scrutinizing my ID, but then he said \"Hey...look up and to your right\". It was pretty confusing, until I spied a little camera that took my mugshot before I could ask what the point was.  \"We have to photograph anyone who's under 25\", he said. Not his fault, and he wasn't being a douche, but this is some 1984 shit that made me feel unwelcome.  OK, done ranting, this bar is tons of fun once you make it inside. Huge tables to chill out and get sloshed with large groups. Drinks are the usual Westgate price, but unlike a couple of other bars, they are made RIGHT. I guess they didn't just hire their bartenders for their boob jobs and bleached hair. My 'chocolate cake' shot was the most delicious $8 I've ever spent.  The crowd is nice, and who could forget the mechanical bull? It's the main attraction of this bar; you can come watch all the sluts from Scottsdale show how they ride. Win.  The most innovative part of this bar is what happens after last call. The blaring music stops, and the kitchen reopens, reverting back to a restaurant until 3:30. I'm wary of all Westgate food, but I have to admit it's a pretty badass idea.  3.5 stars rounded down for that mugshot. I'll become a true fan if their food turns out tasty."}
{"text":"Other than the football stadium Saddle Ranch is about the only good thing I can find in this area. The other bars are a bit ghetto for me, but a Saddle Ranch is a Saddle Ranch.   I usually end up at the Scottsdale location at some point in the evening when going out in Old Town. I have pregame and brunched it up at the one a few times. Awesome drink specials in the AM, $1.99 mimosas and bloody mary's, Yes please! Thank you! The lay out of this one I think is a bit cooler than the others. There is a fun up-stars part with a few table, larger area for the bull riding but I think the patio is a little smaller.   Saddle Ranch is always a good time! make sure to get a friend to ride the bull. Convinced my friend Bryan to ride is backwards on a dare once, almost peed my pants I was laughing so hard. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Not a whole lot going on here for people who done eat meat. We eat seafood and there just weren't a ton of option. What they did have was dripping in grease. Yuck. Service wasn't fantastic either."}
{"text":"A group of friend and I went to Saddle Ranch in Scottsdale last Saturday night. It was somewhat early still so it wasn't too crowded, which is nice, because most nights it is packed!   We had a ton of fun. The entire staff from the hostess at the front door, to the mechanical bull operator, to the managers were super nice! I want to give a special thanks to the manager Anthony for making a personal visit to our table to make sure everything was good with us and personally served us a round of shots and some cotton candy. Thanks Anthony!   I would recommend this place for sure. I have yet to have dinner there, but there breakfast is very good! Have fun!"}
{"text":"Hola!!! It's a huge huge place with a large menu! I was here with 5 of my friends....so the BBQ Baby back ribs were fabulous. Also, I really enjoyed the tortilla soup. I am a harsh critic of tortilla soup and I was pleased. We were sitting outside ready to order....then the skies opened up and it started to rain a bit. We were moved inside to a table in front of the mechanical bull. We got a cheerful and polite server. Gabrielle was efficient, patient and delightful. I'm visiting from New York and I was pleased...oh bummer!!! My friends a party of 8 had to leave just as I was writing this review because they were not allowed to sit at any of the 9 empty tables near us...lost a star...Gabriella. You are still awesome but I'm getting why the scores are low..."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!! they weren't even busy and yet still waited 15 min for a waitress...then never got sweetener for my ice tea....I had to go ask the bartender for some."}
{"text":"I don't know why people keep insisting on coming here, but rest assured if there is a birthday, anniversary, or promotion someone will enthusiastically suggest Saddle Ranch as the venue to celebrate. Maybe it's the mechanical bull... but for me watching some 19 year old ride the bull while some 40 year old dude wearing an affliction shirt and years of regret shouts inappropriate things at a girl young enough to be is daughter is more the makings of a To Catch a Predator episode rather than a good time. I know it's not the service... I've been to multiple locations, and this one multiple times, and I can tell you it isn't the service.  Unless your favorite type of beer is an empty one, then this is your joint.  Must be the cotton candy.  Yes, that's it.  If you really need some cotton candy and the Arizona State Fair isn't in town then I suggest Saddle Ranch."}
{"text":"Had never been here before.  Was just walking by (looking in at the fenced patio), and if it weren't for the hostess standing out on the sidewalk inviting me to take a closer look inside, I probably would have kept walking.  I stepped into the main building entrance where I was again greeted, this time by Ashley (a server) who told me about the place, the mechanical bull, the specials, even some of the buildings history.  I felt right at home and decided to take a seat and txt my friend to join me.  After she arrived, we were welcomed by the GM (Rob) who came to our table with a tasty treat (his complements) and he spent a good 5 minutes answering our queries about the building, it's history, the company, their other locations, etc.    This place is AWESOME.  I mean, it's already a cool place, but the people that take care of you here make the experience unforgettable.    Great service and a fun experience.  Highly recommended evening of fun."}
{"text":"The bartenders were cool and the food was delicious! They rang the bell for me which made me feel pretty special! The crowd was mixed with a few older and mostly younger people. We had free drinks all night from one of the patrons who offered to pay for me to ride the bull. I passed...no need to break any bones! We had major fun!"}
{"text":"It's CInco de Mayo and this place is deserted. It hasn't even been opened that long. I realize it's a Monday and everything, but people still go out and get drunk because it's the 5th of May. Loco Patron across the street was packed. The dew-baggio factor was high at Loco, but not so much at Saddle Ranch.   I've been to the one in L.A. many times and it's really touristy and stupid and all, but I like it because I always meet cool people there who are visiting from someplace else as opposed to snarky asshole local LA people who won't like me because I'm not from LA. They also have stiff drinks in large amounts at reasonable prices, great food and good enough service considering how busy they always are.  I think this SR in SoSco has the potential to be the same eventually - but for now it's just trying to figure itself out. I wouldn't even try to go when there's a line, but that's me. This being the case, I probably won't end up there when it's really busy. I'm kinda glad it's here and I hope it settles down. I'm pretty sure it'll do well in this town."}
{"text":"Ride it Hard,   The Mechanical Bull is what this place is all about.  Monday is a cash contest, The bar has Music Videos on Flat Screens and guys and ladies are rockin the bull here and there, This place is so entertaining from the minute you walk in.    Ladies Saddle up and for some reason the bull seems to take its time and shake a little bit more for you.   The Staff is defiantly hand picked buy someone with a great eye, no complaints here.  Food, Well not bad, don't expect this to be the best Steak in town.  People don't come just to eat.    Dessert, YES PLEASE, some items are very pricey but I stick with the Deep Dish Cookie, always best shared with those around you.  If you don't have friends order a dessert you might meet some."}
{"text":"I love the western theme & the mechanical bull is entertaining. Food is average but huge portions, great for sharing. The bartender's always give me free shots. Got to love that!"}
{"text":"I love this place. You can ride the bull, eat good food, and have a big fluffy Cotton Candy Tower.  The ribs are great and so is the loaded potato."}
{"text":"Definitely a fun place to go with a group. There is a large bar and they are usually very accomidating if you are with a good amount of people. The main attraction at Saddle Ranch is the bull riding ring. Even if you're not taking part in it, it is still amusing to watch others give it a try.   I wouldn't say the food is amazing, but I thought the sandwich and fries I had hit the spot and were reasonably priced.   Also, I have been here for bloody marys on a Sunday and enjoyed sitting outside with some drinks."}
{"text":"Food was very good, service was great. Two different managers came by to make sure we had everything we needed. Portions were a very good size, we shared a burger and sweet potato fries. Our server Missy was very friendly and attentive. This was our 1st time here and probably not our last. Fun environment!"}
{"text":"I went there because of the Gilbert Iglesias (Fluffy). The menu online is not the menu on a special event (much shorter version). The prices even change (higher). Don't eat the ribs!!! I had the monster platter. It contains 3 mini burgers, 6 ribs, sweet potato fries, onion rings, and hot wings. The worst ribs I ever had, they were so over cooked (almost burnt). It seemed like they were either cooked the day before or cooked early in the morning. The burgers were so cold. They seemed like they were sitting on the counter for awhile. I just didn't like flavor of the wings. The three sauces were less than marginal. The sweet potato fries just didn't seem fresh. However, the onion rings were awesome!!! The draft beer tower is a joke $47.50 and it only serves 7-8 less than average size glasses. Here is the the funny part the Corona is consider a premium beer (they charge more). The owner and the manger really should pay more attention to detail or get out of the restaurant business. Obviously they don't care!!! I went there two other couples. None of us will ever eat there again. My visit was on 5/20/2017."}
{"text":"My sister had her wedding last night, so we were looking for somewhere to have a big family breakfast this morning. I thought, \"Saddle Ranch is big and I'm sure it'll be pretty empty at breakfast.\" I really wasn't expecting great food just somewhere we could all get together. I called an hour before they opened expecting to leave a message and someone answered. She took care of our reservation for 24... Yes 24 lol. She let the cook and staff know ahead of time and they were ready for us. We got our food in a timely manner and the manager checked on us several times. They mixed up one order but quickly corrected it apologizing profusely. I had the pancake breakfast it was good. There maple peppered bacon is really tasty so is there sausage. My daughter loves her pancakes. My husband liked his steak an eggs. But the best plate in our group was by far the chicken and biscuits. It's chicken, eggs (however you like them) biscuits, bacon gravy, with green onions on top... Sooooo good. I usually only go to Saddle Ranch for drinks but I will be eating chicken and biscuits from there soon. A couple bites from my neice wasn't nearly enough."}
{"text":"I hosted a pre-chemotherapy get together at Saddle Ranch Chop House for a girlfriend of mine that's facing down breast cancer last night and I was NOTHING but impressed with the level of service from everyone, the quality of the food, and professionalism from our server, Teresa.  From the manager that checked in on us last night to make sure we were enjoying ourselves, right down to the employee that took my initial phone call and made the reservation for my event a week ago.  Good work, guys!    Saddle Ranch took care of every detail for us and was very attentive to our needs last night; making sure that our table was set up and decorated with balloons before we arrived, to surprising our whole table (adults only) with a round of pink lemonade vodka shots and two towers of pink cotton candy for our table!    Really I could not be more pleased with them and wanted to thank them personally on Yelp for the excellent service at my friend's very important night out last night.    Thank you guys for making my friend's night special!"}
{"text":"Good points: text messaging to notify you seating is available, large restaurant and bar, and entertaining to watch people ride the mechanical bull. Down side: Very loud inside, difficult to hold conversations, service was slow, food was not served hot, and for a place that advertises rock music, I only heard 1 rock song out of 10 songs played."}
{"text":"A theme type restaurant. Definitely a go to place for fun and late night jaunts. They do line dancing,ride the bull,etc...It's a bit disconcerting when you first go in-a huge room,with booths along the wall,and seating in the middle,with a full third of the space taken up by the bull. There is a bar,and behind the bar, a few more booths. We preferred sitting there,actually. A bit more quiet and private. As far as the food goes,I think it's more hype than substance. I was actually really disappointed in it. After seeing it on tv in Los Angeles on numerous dating shows,I was anxious to see what it was about.  We went for dinner and had steak-nice selection of food on the menu,and a good selection of sides,but the steaks were just ok.  We also tried it for breakfast on the weekend-we need more breakfast places around here so I was really happy they were open weekend mornings--what can I say-a little disappointing.. The hash browns were actually inedible they were so dry!!! I am not too anxious to try it again!"}
{"text":"We had to send some food back with issues but the manager made it right. The server was pleasant and helpful.  For a holiday week Wednesday it was very empty. Will most likely return and give it another try."}
{"text":"Horrible food and service here on Sunday while going to the rodeo. Had to wait 20 minutes for a table because the kitchen needed to catch up when there were tons of tables available. We get seated and ordered our food. The spinach dip comes out with 12 chips on a huge platter for six people. We go to take a bite of the wings and the they are bone cold. The waitress also brought the wrong food for one of our friends. The waitress took the wings back and they came back on the same plate with the spilled ranch. I was scared to eat them. We also waited 15 minutes to get our drinks the bloody Mary's had been sitting so long the vodka had separated from the mix and the sprite was flat and had no syrup.  Headed to Buffalo Wild Wings next time."}
{"text":"Yikes!  This place is scary!  The service was horrible although the waitress's were cute to look at (think Coyote Ugly - The movie).  The food was plentiful but very average.  It was just creapy.  Too bad, the bull riding could have been cool.  Just not my thing.   Sunday afternoon seems to be the time to go.  Everyone was drinking and watching the game on flat screens.  Reminded me of a place you might see the girls from Rock of Love hanging out at!  Ha!"}
{"text":"Can we say mechanical bull! I may have try it!  If your looking for a fun evening then I highly recommend you going here!"}
{"text":"Do not go. Flat out, too expensive for the food. The staff was horrible. They took a credit card before ordering and charged $50 hold prior to ordering. I've never seen that. My visit was after a football game and the excuse was that they were busy because of that. I don't want excuses, the schedule is on line. Staff it properly!!!"}
{"text":"Went here after cardinals game. Was noisy, and loud. Food wasn't good and expensive. Will eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Very cool place to go. Wish they had one near my neck of the woods. We had the nicest waitress, Melissa. Can't say enough about her great customer service. I had the Jalapeño Mac & Cheese. Yummy. Then Keli coerced me into their Cotton Candy & S'Mores. It's vacation what the ...  Watched March Madness, ate a great meal surrounded by good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love a late night here, although I wish the entertainment was more than just watching the mechanical bull riding or t.v.'s. The bartenders are awesome and fun, although my drink size varies on whether I'm with my girlfriends or boyfriend.They make a great electric lemonade. Wish they had live music, dancing, etcetera."}
{"text":"Like most other reviews, don't waste your time. An hour and a half later, server was told by the kitchen, no clue how long of a wait for our TWO burgers."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst dinner out we have ever had.  Dirty silverware.  Warm beer.  Sent back 6 of 14 dinners.  Watched waitstaff rub the beloved cotton candy on the curtains hiding the kitchen every time they brought it out.  Gross!"}
{"text":"Food was OK but not spectacular. Service was horrible and took forever. We were seated and 15 minutes later we had to ask who our server was. We kept having to ask for water and drink refills. When our food came out they got 3 of 6 orders wrong and we sent 2 back. Instead of trying to speed things and make service better they kept wanting to bring us shots. Some of our party weren't drinking and we aren't in college anymore... Go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Went here for a drink while waiting for our table at Stingray (across the street) and it was very entertaining. There was a fun crowd and most people were huddled around the bull. You could not pay me to ride a bull in one of these bars, but it is hilarious to watch the drunk guys and girls that attempt it! Wish we could have stayed longer, seemed like a fun laidback place."}
{"text":"so i took my mom here on sunday before a concert that was taking place at 3pm at the Gila River Arena next door. When we got to the restaurant it was 1:38pm. I asked the hostess how long the wait for 2 people would be, she told me \"10-15 minutes but should be shorter than that\". So i put my name in and sat down to wait. I get it the place was busy but the table turn around seemed pretty quick so i wasn't worried. Then at around 2:05 i went up to the hostess and asked her about how much longer. the list that i was on wasn't even the list they were working off of at that point. She tells me it shouldn't be that much longer. I then asked her why she told me 10-15 minutes when it was already close to 30 minutes, she snapped at me and yelled \"it's not an exact time i told you it may be around that time.\" to which i stepped back and said, don't yell at me, i just don't understand why you would say a lower time instead of estimating over, especially since you added in the 'should be shorter' phrasing. she then yelled at me again telling me to just 'wait or leave'. I then asked another hostess to speak to a manager. she told me she'd get me one, but never did. I saw a woman who i believed to be the manager and asked her if she was, she replied yes. I told her that i was sorry because i knew it was busy, and recanted what the hostess said. I told her i understood that it was busy, but rudeness like that was unacceptable. She told me she would talk to her. If she did i do not know.  when we finally got seated our server was awesome! she really did a great job. However the rolls that they brought to the table weren't even cooked....pretty much warmed raw dough the food took 25 minutes to come out. All and all HORRIBLE experience, but then again when the first employee you deal with (the hostess wearing a beanie) has a major attitude and disdain to all humans it kind of lets you know what you're in for."}
{"text":"I went to West Gate for the first time, the evening of 04/21/17. Walked around and this restaurant caught my attention. The restaurant contained seating on the interior and exterior, and was large. The restaurant was based on a western theme. I had the long island ice tea (alcohol) and the BBQ bacon burger. The service was great and the food was awesome. The restaurant was very clean. I will go back."}
{"text":"Came in here before s football game, it was way Busy. So we went to the bar and got a couple of seats. The ribs were good, got them with sweet potato fries. With how busy it was we didn't have to wait long for our food. Fun atmosphere before a game. I have a mechanical bull you could ride. It's always good to see a cute girl trying to ride a mechanical bull. And to top it off the drinks are pretty cold and delicious. So if you like a good barbecue and a good cold drink before a game what a great place."}
{"text":"Waited 45 min for a table. Finally got one and then waited over 15 minutes for a server to come so we told the hostess and said we had to leave and we were very disappointed. Never coming back. O"}
{"text":"Came for a pre concert dinner and it it was underwhelming. The food was okay but the portions were oddly out of line. I ordered a half rack of ribs that ended up being a 3 inch X 3 inch portion all for $19+. Will we be back? Probably not."}
{"text":"Awesome food, atmosphere, bartenders, sweet as sugah bull riding operator. They give you free cotton candy (how nostalgic) if you hang out for a little bit and then stir up the inner cowgirl and get you to give the bull a shot. This place is always a good time with a great staff. One of my favorite spots in Old Town! Go for happy hour, its even better then!"}
{"text":"Great hang out place, bar scene.  Would get more stars if the food was any good? Just don't expect to eat here...Its a great bar, entertaining with the ride on bull, and even more fun when you are in a group of willing participants.  A few shots, drinks, and everyone wants a shot at the bull.  During my visits it free men entertainment, FYI most people there do not want to see a guy ride the bull..... Great bar, since it does have a decent crowd, free entertainment, and indoor and outdoor seating.  Three bars to get drinks from as well.  I give it an OK, 3 stars since after eating here, more than once the food is over priced and just not good at all."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start.  This was the worst!  Took over an hour to get our food, was told by management they would deduct something from our bills, which ended up being 20%, something I would have received anyway because I had a discount card.  I canceled my meal and had to remind them to remove it from my check.  Long story short, when I told them they didn't do anything for me, they felt not charging me for the meal I canceled was sufficient.  I tried explaining this to the senior manager and he j st didn't get it!  Finally, he said he would take care of my $11 bill.  As I was leaving, a server was telling  security about the lady not wanting to pay her bill.  Big mistake!   I slammed the $ down with a few choice words.  NEVER again, would I step foot into this establishment."}
{"text":"Saddle Ranch is a welcome addition to old town. This place has been consistently busy since it opened recently. I have yet to dine here, but late at night it is fun to get plowed while watching people get tossed off the mechanical bull. It has a cowboy theme, but the music is far from country (thank god), and the bar crowd is definitely hip.  No dance floor - Yea!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, whether just for drinks with friends before a coyotes game or for dinner with a mixed crowd of children and adults and each time the service has been great. I honestly didn't expect much, but I  am glad to say the Saddle ranch far exceeded my expectations! There's always a vastly mixed crowd. Men in suits and ties, women penis necklaces celebrating a bachelorette party, families, older, younger, frat boys and sorority chicks and every one seems to have a great time. While the food is really good, I will say its nothing earth shattering. It's all tasty and the portions are big. You can't really go wrong. Tryi the smores for dessert!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a couple appetizers and a drink on Friday.  During happy hour their appetizers and drinks are half price.  We had the artichoke dip and chicken tenders, which were both good, a notch above standard bar fare.  4 drinks and two appetizers ran us $30 with tip.  Not sure how much I would enjoy Saddle Ranch past happy hour unless with a good sized group, but I intend to hit it up again."}
{"text":"i have visited the restaurant on a couple occasions prior to my latest lunch dinning experience and the previous times were not memorable enough good or bad to express an opinion. However my latest experience i have felt compelled to share my thoughts. as we arrived on a saturday after visiting a friend in the area for her graduation party, the atmosphere was of an average weekend gathering with maybe a little bigger crowd than usual. The 3 people i was with ordered a wrap, an omelette, and my original burger medium. had a couple 2 dollar mimosas and began to wait for 1 hour and 30 minutes to be served. now maybe it had to do with the large amount of families or maybe this is a common expectation for a weekend lunch either way i felt this was too long. the kicker is when i received my dry well well done burger i laughed and asked the waiter if they could take it back and and just cancel my order. the wator replied i would be glad to take it back and see if the cook can make you a new order medium done as he agreed this burger was well overcooked. I replied with the fact i am not willing to wait another hour but thanks for the offer. the only good that came out of this was that i am now reassured that my home cooking grass fed beef is not comparable to a restaurant broiler!"}
{"text":"I am giving 2 stars cause the service was good.  But the food to salty and greasy literally came home with a sour stomach from that place."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing, and the portions where huge, but service is another story. We showed up to the restaurant with a party of 12, we had made a reservation several weeks ago for this party size. We showed up at 7:30, ordered our appetizers, and drinks. We got our appetizers pretty quickly, but it took a while for our drinks. Then they took out dinner orders at 8:30, yes, a whole later. Then our food didn't show up to the table until 9:10, seriously 9:10pm. The forgot to add two of the people in our parties food to the order, so they didn't get their food until 9:35. They literally had to watch other people eat in front of them. When we tried to confront management, they just said \"sorry, but the kitchen has been busy all night.\" Then in one final attempt to make up for the poor service, the try to bring us a giant spool of cotton candy that no one asked for. This is one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had (and I've eaten at Sizzler). I will never be back to this place again, and our party was looking for a regular place to come eat when were in town for the Cardinal games. Our bill was close to $600 last night, imagine the gratuity that your servers are missing out on."}
{"text":"Other than a very few handful of places, the Phoenix area isn't noted for dining/drinking districts (say for example like Mill Avenue). Most of them here tend to be popup \"food courts\", usually in malls or near event venues ... like this one. They get busy during an event but I couldn't tell you for a million bucks why people would purposely drive there with the primary intent to eat or drink. Last night was an example of that, a Friday night with a concert event at the arena. The restaurants were packed from about 6 pm until about 7:55 pm and suddenly the place was deserted. The food menu at the Saddle House was a one-page limited \"event menu\" (and of course unlimited drink selections).  Like the surrounding \"theme\" restaurants the wait to be seated at 7 pm was an hour and the service snail-slow. Do the people who own these bar/restaurants not get the concept of staffing and timing to get patrons seated, fed, and out by the time an event starts?  We ended up sitting at a back, almost hidden, bar to eat. The one sole bartender was tasked with taking care of that entire area and, it appears, a good part of the rest of the restaurant. He was working his butt off!  The limited event menu was pretty basic, a few sandwiches and salads (and an unlimited selection of drinks). I had a burger that was about $15, which isn't unreasonable considering the location. It wasn't bad, nor was it great, but if you like fries there were a LOT of fries. Oh, and a pickle.  Bottom line - if you're here for an event this place beats eating stale microwaved pizza inside the arena.  I can't come up with even one reason why I would ever purposely choose to come to the Westgate Entertainment District just to eat/drink, even if it was free, unless I was one of those people who consider this a big step up in fine dining from a regular routine at McDonalds (PS - I'm not).  Other than the hard-working bartender who I give kudos to this place is on my list to avoid."}
{"text":"I only a gave 1 star because zero is not an option.   We had a group of 12-15 and it was the worst. Tables didn't have silverware and we only had one server who was great and did the best being just her.  They should've assigned 2 servers.  We left kabukis to go to saddleranch to celebrate a 21st bday. The food took long and didn't have the right food. Someone in our party order salad and it tasted like dirt and there was a plastic piece in the salad.   We really will never go back.  The good - they gave is round of shots because it was bday and some dessert. That was really nice but it's hard to feel to good just cause service sucked.  Our waitress was amazing and it sucked because management didn't recognize she needed help.  The other thing is she's the face of the restaurant and any bad service is reflected on her which I don't agree."}
{"text":"Saddle Ranch is not somewhere I would frequent but happened to have a gift certificate there from work xmas party and thought it was about time to use it.    Its funny.  When you walk into Saddle Ranch and look at the wall decorum you will find yourself staring at axes, saws, handcuffs, whips... all hung up ALL over the walls.  if it wasn't for the giant bar in the middle of the place you may think you've walked in to Chainsaw massacre's torture chamber.  It made me laugh at least.    There is the mechanical bull, which provides some entertainment (jocks mistakenly thinking they are rodeo stars).   The service was actually really great when I have been there but I find it all quite expensive... food and drink alike.  They did make a dirty martini quite well though and gave me extra olives :)"}
{"text":"Meat market.  Good place to shop for sausage, wizard sleeves and STDs.  That's about it."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to whet your whistle next Saturday or Sunday afternoon? As a huge proponent of Sunday Funday, I have to recommend Saddle Ranch as one of my all time faves. While Old Town Scottsdale is known for its plethora of nightlife, it's day-drinking scene can sometimes be overlooked. With a huge outdoor area that comes complete with ceiling fans, covered tables, and misters (a definite necessity if you're eating outside in AZ anytime of the year between April and October), its a patio-lover's paradise!   The food is delicious, and the portions are definitely sharing-sized. My go-to hangover meal is always the baked green chili and jack macaroni and cheese. I consider myself somewhat of a Mac N Cheese connoisseur, and honestly - this dish is heavenly!   The best part of spending your Saturday or Sunday morning/afternoon at Saddle are the drink specials. All of their specialty mimosas and bloody marys are only $2 a piece until 3pm! If you like your bloody spicy, I recommend the Jalapeno one - it's definitely got some kick!   If you really want to do it right, I recommend arriving around 11am (it's busier once the football games start), bring some friends and your board game of choice (my friends and I are partial to Apples to Apples), spread yourselves out on a roomy patio table, and settle in for a day of cheap drinks and lots of laughs. Just tell the waitress to keep those mimosa's coming!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like it. I missed the friend who suggested we go. The company I went with was by far the best thing about the dining experience. This is just another tired bar trying to squeeze a few more bucks out of those of us too stupid to eat out at Westgate. We were not all that hungry so we ended up having one drink each, one appetizer, one salad and one sandwich.  Total cost $80. WTF? 80 bucks for three drinks and minimal food? Are you freaking kidding me? This place calls itself a chop house. I can get better food at Subway. I have had super crappy dining experiences at Westgate on a number of occasions so my thought was why order chicken when for $2 more you can get beef. Less likely make me sick, right?  Ugh...The French dip was about as appealing as a hot dog bun with some dollar store meat heated in a microwave.  The oh so wonderful spinach dip recommended by our waitress came with a heaping of stale gross chips. Large Stella? Plastic glass and all of 20 ounces at best. I was charged close to $11 for that crap...Ug....why do I ever go to Westgate? Every restaurant here is a shit show."}
{"text":"Maybe I should have just come for the bar.  I arrived, late, and wasn't able to order.  Good thing, because the portions are huge and everyone had leftovers, so I just ate theirs.  I sampled it all, and you'll be getting the calories for your money.  Too much reliance on butter and sugar.  Cheap, huge portions, but not the place I'd pick to eat.  The bar looked fun, but the birthday girl wanted to hit the clubs.  Maybe if I come back just for the bar, it might change my opinion."}
{"text":"I have never ate her so I am only going rating this spot as a bar. Saddle Ranch gets really crowded on the weekends, if you're into drinking in a crowded room than this place is for you. The drinks are a little pricey but overall its one of the better places to grab a drink compared to the other options in the area.   Not good for families or kids after 8pm."}
{"text":"Any restaurant with a mechanical bull automatically gets 5 stars from me! Not to mention, as a lover of ahi, seeing 4 ahi items on the menu sent tingles through my soul. I decided on the ahi salad and couldn't be more pleased with my decision. It was probably the most flavorful ahi salad I've ever had. In addition, the drinks were relatively strong. I ordered the sweet tea vodka with lemonade, and the waitress sugeested adding peach shnapps which I must say was a splendid idea. The decor is awesome. Reminds me of Texas. There is something hung on every square foot of the walls, and there are cute slash funny little cowboy quotes burned on wooden signs. The service was good, food was delicious, and atmosphere was festive. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here! Wonderful western decor inside and out. This was their 6th Anniversary celebration so they were blowing up tons of balloons. They brought a basket of bread with mini corn muffins and dinner rolls before the meal. My spouse ordered the French Dip and I had the Chicken pizza. His sandwich was served hot and stuffed with meat. He liked the sweet potato fries and marshmallow cinnamon dip. We both had passion tea. My pizza was made fresh and was a true artisan pizza. Very unique. It was our first time in so we were treated to cotton candy (cherry cheesecake flavor) for dessert which is quite a nice and different added touch. The portions are large so we took boxes home. Our server was Steve and he was very attentive. The manager came by and introduced himself. The place wasn't busy but there were people coming and going. Priced at about $20-30 per person depending on what is ordered. We would recommend this place to our friends & look forward to returning. No complaints means 5 stars!"}
{"text":"It's very tempting to want to go here on a game day, but you are better off tailgating with KFC.  The service isn't that bad for being such a busy place, I mean there is a line out the door & a significant wait, but the food is really terrible.  You could complain, but I don't think it would get any better.   The goal is to feed & water the masses, and that it does, but you will leave a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"Went to Saddle Ranch to watch the UFC and celebrate a coworkers birthday.  As always I had a great time the fight was free to get into and watch and the food was great.  For starters you get cornbread muffins with this amazing cinnamon butter.  Then I had the baseball sirloin with garlic whipped mashed potatoes and green beans.  The steak was done medium rare and was very tasteful with just enough juice left in it.  The service was very good and we had a great night.  For all your UFC watching needs this is the place to be.  Lots of TV's and they put the whole speaker system on the fight."}
{"text":"Went for the UFC on Saturday and as usual got a great seat to watch the fight.  The bar staff is very friendly and always ready to give you a refill.  I usually get the nachos or mini burgers and they are great, but I decided to try something new and I got the southwestern wrap.  I wasn't too impressed with it to be honest but I know their other stuff is great so I will just go back to what I know is great."}
{"text":"Service was great and the sloppy joes rock. The cotton candy was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on 3/21/2013 with two out of town business associates. I wanted to take them to a Western themed restaurant as one associate was from another country.  One person was a vegetarian, the other wanted steak.   At the sidewalk, looking at the menu board, the hostess ushered us in, after we asked if we could get in and out in 45 minutes. She assured us we could as they weren't very busy. The restaurant was at 30% capacity.  After we were seated and waited 10 minutes, and no waitress had stopped at our table, I flagged down a manager who apologized for the wait and took our order.  We all ordered the same Cajun Burger. There were many bandana clad servers and staff on the floor and I saw two tables return food that was not ordered or incorrect.  After another 30 minutes of waiting, I flagged down the same manager who apologized profusely and went to the kitchen and our food arrived shortly thereafter.  The waitress did manage to refill our drinks once but we had barely seen her on the floor. She offered no apologies or explanations.    At that time we had less than ten minutes to be back to our meeting and had to gulp down the food.  The manager apologized again and offered us coupons for 20% off that we threw away. The food was good, but the wait and service were so bad that the experience left a bad taste in our mouths and we would never return."}
{"text":"this place looks super cool on the outside, which is the reason we decided to have lunch here. the staff was all very friendly - and they were ALL skinny and pretty, no joke. obviously they aren't eating the buttermilk biscuits with honey butter that they serve, otherwise they would be obese - i could have eaten 10, legit.  i was pretty hungover and wasn't in the mood to eat a lot - i went with some chicken fingers, which came with some awesome bbq sauce. they were super crispy, and the serving size was quite large. the boyfriend had a bbq chicken salad, which was also large. he liked his choice as well.  their drinks looked interesting, unfortunately i was still a little afraid of alcohol at that point. i really wanted to go back the next day for brunch, but i also wanted to try something different, as we were only in scottsdale  for 3  days. i can't wait to go back and hit this place up again, it was a fun atmosphere with an incredible menu and great servers."}
{"text":"It was Sunday in America, our nieces had packed up and headed back to their respective parents (fueled by a hypergolic combination of maple syrup and chocolate leftover from Easter...I have no idea how they got their little hands on all that sugar and chocolate) and the Beautiful Carin and I were, once again, free birds!  http://tinyurl.com/ca67ff  We decided a celebration was in order...we love our nieces and nephews, make no mistake (in fact, \"Auntie Carin\" is a family legend...the good kind) but it's always good to rev the kids up and then send them back to their mommies and daddies...kind of a practice session for when we have grandkids.  After everyone was gone, we decided a big ol' breakfast/brunchy meal was in order and since I had a Groupon for Saddle Ranch...well, you see where this is headed, don't you?  The joint was really jumpin'...I mean for a lazy Sunday in America, it was really going strong...we soon found out why...\"Babes on Bulls\"...adorable young ladies, in the fullest bloom of babehood were going to be riding the bull, while wearing very little in the way of clothing!  Is there a better way to spend a lazy Sunday morning/early afternoon than eating too much, having a few cocktails and watching live softcore?  I don't think so, either!  Babes on Bulls was a charity event...I have no idea what the charity was, but Carin and I donated, anyway...if only because the name of the event reminded me of the last great cinematic feature I saw...I think the movie was called \"Babes on Bob\"...there was a little riding going on in that movie, too!  A huge and pretty tasty breakfast of steak and eggs, hash browns, biscuits and half a six pack of Devilish Something Bloody Mary's later, I was ready for the show  And what a nice little show...Babes rode the mechanical Bull...lot's of \"yee-haw's\"...lots of jiggling...lots of hootin' and hollerin' from the crowd...in short, pretty much exactly what you expect when you walk into SRCH!  Sure, there are better breakfasts around...even some within my walking radius...but...SRCH is pretty decent  grub and better than average drinks and service (I mean, these people are always smiling and friendly) and ...\"Babes on Bulls\"...I mean come on!"}
{"text":"Slow service and rude, abrasive, disrespectful mangers who called the police because we refused to pay for $100 of food and drinks that we did not order or receive. Very disappointed and shocked!"}
{"text":"Bartenders= 100% cool. Bouncers = Douche-bags. Management= A step above a monkey in a suit. Great place for sub-standard food that is way overpriced.  It also has really nice cheap and corny decor inside.  If you wear Tap-Out gear with a bandana tied on your head or if you are a 45+ patron \"trying\" to recapture a youthful night of fun, come here and you will fit right in.  You could throw a dart at a map and find an establishment with better food and there are waaaaay more places in walking distance that are more fun to grab a drink at. Saddle Ranch (even the 2 in LA), you guys should crawl in a hole and die."}
{"text":"Service was the worst I can remember.  Took too long to deliver the meal (they were NOT BUSY). The bread was stale. Asked for new bread, it came after dinner was finished. Asked for Ketchup for the fries, it never came. Took 8 minutes to get the check.  And the food was not worth what they charged for it."}
{"text":"The food is ok at best. This was our third and final time eating breakfast here. After an hour and a half one person in our group of five dad still not gotten her omlett that she sent back because it came out wrong. Every time we have been here it takes forever to get your food. Only go here if you love to wait 30-40 minutes for your food to come out."}
{"text":"This place is meh..the drinks are overpriced, the food is overpriced (but pretty good) and the music is okay."}
{"text":"I've been to Saddle Ranch twice, once for weekend brunch/lunch and once for a night out.   Brunch/Lunch: HUGE portions... I mean HUGE! I had an ahi tuna wrap (I know, totally non-western) and it was decent; a little tastless, but fresh and filling. I also tried the garlic mashed taters and they were good, but not anything to rave about. The service was awful, but the manager made up for it by bringing our entire table free shots and enormous plates of dessert. The shots were basically flavored water, but the desserts were moist, rich brownies with lots of ice cream.  Friday night: The place was packed with an odd mix in the crowd. You had sports fans, mixed with tourists, mixed with silicone. It was so busy and we had such a large group (friend's birthday) that I was able to tune out the urge to people watch. Didn't eat much, but the wait staff was much more attentive. What's odd is that we got free shots again (at 2 separate tables from different waiters) and free dessert. I noticed a trend that most of the wait staff was delivering trays of shots to the various tables. Our table of women were also approached by the bull-ride conductor (is that what you would call him?) and told that we'd get free rides if we could muster up the courage to hop on the saddle.  Conclusion: I'm not sure how this place makes as much money as it portrays because of all the freebies. However, it could be a brilliant scheme to keep everyone there, drinking for hours, and keeping up the image that it's THE place to party."}
{"text":"This place is SOOOO friendly! The bouncers opened the door for me. The bartender introduced herself to me then actually extended her hand to me to shake it. The manager came over TWICE to make sure everything was ok...and it was!"}
{"text":"I love the location and overall appearance of this place. We all enjoyed our food and the truffle Mac & cheese was super good but the service was ridiculously slow considering the place was almost empty and spending $75 for lunch for 4 was a little more than I like to spend for lunch. Especially since we all ordered the lower priced menu items. We may go back but I will try out the other restaurants in this location first to see if they have better service."}
{"text":"Been with my fiancé (now my wife) numerous times. Always have a good experience, but this time it was fantastic! Our server, Allajah, was extremely friendly, prompt in our orders, and very polite! Food and drinks came out in a time. This review is not just for the restaurant, but for Allajah! THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"We went here with some friends from out of town and they loved it.  We were comped some shots because we had to wait but it was wonderful.  One of our friends even rode the mechanical bull.  Good fun !  They comped us a giant Cotton Candy in a metallic martini glass that was fun to pass around the table.  Great environment.  We sat out on the front patio.  Great Service,  Great food, Great Ambiance..  a lot of fun."}
{"text":"I just love the atmosphere of this place. It screams fun times.  First off it's huge, so you usually don't have to fight for a seat.  Second, they play great music in my opinion.  It's mostly hard rock.  This is so much better than the typical dance music they play at most other places.  Also, they have those giant cotton candy things and a mechanical bull.  Plus great food.  What more do you want?"}
{"text":"I am writing this review as I wait here for the server to take our order. We've arrived at 7:45 pm. The waitress has arrived at 7:56 pm. She has taken our drink order at 7:56pm.  We ordered Two beers,  a Pepsi and waters .  They've arrived at 8:00 pm. She has taken our order at 8:02. It is 8:07 pm, she brought out the cornbread and biscuits. So far so good.  8:20pm. Food has arrived. They are getting a 4 for good service. They lost 1 star for a late start."}
{"text":"Lies, deception, the wait. All for the \"Tuesday all you can eat ribs\". Here on business, apparently it's an event night in town. So packing the doors on a regular night is different than an event night. Disappointed. Waited all day for this."}
{"text":"Ate here for breakfast. I've had better breakfast at Denny's. My eggs were way over cooked and the pancakes were like cold cardboard. I had to send them back. The waitress was very nice and embarrassed about the food. Too boot, the restaurant was full of these tiny little gnat type bugs that were flying everywhere. Even after being asked to move away from the window they were still buzzing our heads.Will not eat here again"}
{"text":"Terrible!  Made reservations for my mother n laws bday.  The worst service ever! Every meal was wrong took forever,  no drinks  and some of our guest ended up leaving for lack of service.  2 of our guest never even got their diners."}
{"text":"This place was fun, the food pretty decent, but it was not the place to take my elderly parents. We visited on a weekend and it was busy. It'd be fun if I were out for a night on the town with some friends, but I just wanted to take my folks out for a nice, peaceful dinner. Between the mechanical bull, bells rung at the bar, and the punching bag machine, it felt more like a circus than a classy meal place. Service was great, our server toughed it out with some pretty picky old folks. The menu was a little pricey, but not bad. Though I made my reservation right on their Yelp site, it wasn't recognized when we arrived, but they honored it anyhow. I later received a no-show notice, which was rectified."}
{"text":"Don't eat here.  Just drink here.  On second thought, maybe don't even drink here. For breakfast, I had a lapful of mimosas and somebody else's food.  In their defense, they did comp us the first round of drinks, and we did get free cotton candy.  I dunno, I'm just not impressed."}
{"text":"Food and ambiance at Saddle Ranch area really 2.5 stars at most, but the service and drinks are always on point. I work right around the corner @ the Galleria, so my co-workers and I have had many lunches here. Our group averages about 12-15 people, and usually, that would mean bad service and/or messed up orders. Not here at Saddle! Our drinks are never empty, food is always brought to the right person and the servers check on us regularly. Occasionally there are 2 servers, but it's usually just 1 and he/she always executes it all flawlessly. He/she also never has a problem splitting the bill. At the end of the meal, the manager usually hooks us up w/ free dessert!   I've also been here many times at night w/ friends. We have a bartender friend so it's a great deal. ;-)"}
{"text":"Surprised by the negative reviews. I'm glad I didn't read them before I went here last night. Service was friendly. I ordered the ribeye steak and it was very good. Perfectly marbled and very tender. That's the only thing I have ordered there so I can't speak for any other dish. I sat outside to enjoy chill night but they turned up the music outside as soon as I did. That's the only complaint I have."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the food is decent - I wouldn't seek it out, but it's not bad for a quick lunch. I really liked the sweet potato fries and that  dipping ranch sauce that comes with it. The service is OK...I kind of feel like I'm on an episode of \"Rock of Love\" with all the bedazzled clothes and headband bandanas there, but hey, I guess that's the image they're trying to go for.   If you sit on the patio try to get a table that isn't peeling apart and God awful filthy. I nearly got splinters by grabbing by napkin off the table."}
{"text":"Went on a Coyotes game night, so they had a limited menu. Food was fine. It was better than the service. Our waiter was okay, but definately not a reason to come back. My husband and I ordered black and tans for drinks - his cup wasn't full (they don't have glassware, it's all plastic) and my black and tan came out a muttled brown. My filet mingon was very tasty. My husband was not impressed with the cowboy burger - which says 3 pieces of bacon, but my husband's had only 2. The bonus was that our waiter gave us a free kamikaze each, tasty, though even their shot glasses are plastic. If I'm in Westgate again, I'll probably try a new place first before I head back again."}
{"text":"We have been here several times for hockey games and other nice evenings out. The food is always good and the service is great. Tonight we had appetizers and a fruit platter (it's 112 degrees out so too hot for steak) and it was very good. But the highlight of the night was the server. Kayley S. Was one of the best servers we have had in quite some time. And we go out to eat a lot. She was quick but not rushed, accurate, never let our drinks get empty (again, it's 112 degrees so we were quite thirsty), and she never complained about anything. I highly recommend requesting her to go along with the great food and fun atmosphere. We will definitely be back and will most certainly be requesting Kayley when we do."}
{"text":"What a horrible experience. I had not been here in several years after my last dissapointing experience . Tonight was worse. They sat a party of 8 in the direct path of bright sunlight .One of my co- workers ordered s salad which came after  his meal and after he asked. I specifically asked for no vegetables and then they brought my baked potato covered in green onions. No mention was made of anyone wanting a 2nd cocktail, bread was brought after most of us had eaten. 7 + minutes between the first person getting food and the last . At the end of the meal the server dropped the check, we had to ask for a dessert menu.   I cannot imagine ever returning ."}
{"text":"Let's assess this place in a REAL way.  It is to be expected when there is a hockey game, football game for this place to be BUSY and sometimes a crazy wait to get in here.  This place does have  a quick turn over, that is why sometimes people complain about the empty tables.  It takes a while to get them clean (I have seen the bus boys busting their buts to do so).  The food is a bit over priced, but when you are willing to go out and quite a bit of food, be prepared.  The drinks are overpriced, no doubt about it...but it's the experience you are paying for, the bull, the environment and the people.    This place is just fine, it doesn't really excel too much but it satisfies the need we have: Food, fun and booze ha!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why anyone in their right mind would come here and expect a good steak or rack of ribs.  The Saddle Ranch is an apps and drinks spot to start or end your night.  Get drunk enough and you might find the balls to want to ride the mechanical bull.  I'll admit that the service was crappy but they made up for it by giving my table complimentary dessert, which isn't too bad if you've been drinking since 4 PM.  I had the appetizer sampler platter and the mac and cheese.  App Samp Platter: The highlights here are the sweet potato fries and the sliders. It is a good thing to order if you have no ribs standards as they give you 1/4th a rack, if you think they're good well then go ahead.  Mac and Cheese: Really weak. Nothing special, they're making mark up profit off this and they ain't afraid to show it, it's sucky and they know it.  The drink options are basic.   I would not be going to the Saddle Ranch on Sunset but in Glendale there's a 25% chance you'll end up here. IF you do, stick to apps, you won't feel so  gipped afterwards."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible, terrible.  Waited an hour and a half for food and it was not good at all.  Manager offered a free desert we didn't want and then charged us for it that needed to be taken off the tab.  Took 30 minutes to get the check - stay clear of this place - you have been warned."}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite at westgate, back when that Australian guy was the manager. His staff was great and the food was good. Over the past couple years this place just gets worse and worse. You'll never get your order taken at a table, you have a better chance sitting at the bar but they are busy making drinks. I've had our server add things to our bill that we didn't order. I've waited 30 minutes for a drink during the day when NO ONE was in there. Just awful, go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Sat outside for 20mins, no drinks, no service, nothing.  They were not busy, have no intention of ever going there again!"}
{"text":"We visited on a Friday night, and of course, we expected the place to be busy.  We had made reservations and when we arrived at the restaurant, there was no host to seat us.  There was already a line of people waiting to be seated....very disorganized.  Food was good.  We had a group of 6, and part of our order was incorrect.  We ordered drinks and they gave everyone their drinks except for mine.  So, if you plan to dine here, be patient!"}
{"text":"Came here before a Coyotes game. Friendly staff and quick seating. Portions are good but over priced $$$... somewhat expected that being so close to the arena."}
{"text":"The service I had, happen to be on St. Patrick's Day. Waited to be seated in 40 mins, which was understandable. We got alert that our table was ready, the host walked us over to our table. Well our table wasn't ready, she had to separate the tables apart waited for another 5 mins standing there. She had us seated and told us I'll get your server, table was not wiped down. I went over to the bar, and asked the bartender for a clean towel. I ended up wiping the table myself. Our waitress came took our order, we noticed another group of customers came in. Same waitress totally forgot about us after her new customers came in. Someone else delivered our food we had no silverware, no salt or pepper shaker on table, no refills on drinks, nothing no checking on us if we needed anything for the 20 mins when we got our food. I myself went to the  bar and ask again the bartender for silverware. thanks for the bartender helping. Overall it was a bad service. I walked out. my mom waited for the waitress and bill, told her everything about her service. All she said was \"SORRY\" and NO TIP for her. We felt like we were in the underground of being in a wrong restaurant, because of our race."}
{"text":"Following my brother's suggestion [he's been here before], about five of us headed out to Saddle Ranch on a Saturday Night.  While going through their ridiculous I.D. checking [twice], we finally got our flashing-beeper-thingy.  We waited for about 45 minutes so it wasn't too bad -- after all, it -is- a bar at Westgate.  So our table finally opens up and we all sit down.  We had such a friendly and funny waiter.  I had ordered a Mojito but apparently they didn't have mint leaves.  Damn.  So I had a Texas Tea and two others ordered their fruity drinks [those guys  -_-;;].  Our drinks had arrived in carafes!  After viewing our huuuge drinks [about $12 a pop] and the crazies on the mechanical bull, we all decided to leave after the booze.  Maybe it's not my kind of scene but  I definitely didn't like it there.  So the highlight of that Saturday night:  Denny's.  Hah!"}
{"text":"We visited on a Sunday around 11:30 am and it was not at all crowded. So few people in such a large room made it feel like a warehouse. It's a great size to accommodate the many people who would come in based on its excellent location.  Service was good. I had the California Chicken Wrap and it was delicious. Large portion size so I took half home. Hubby and daughters enjoyed their food as well."}
{"text":"Place was big, clean, and very western (says Captain Obvious). Service was good. Not sure about the guy working the host stand, who seemed dazed and/or confused.  Food was good, but we expected to be dazzled considering the price compared to other restaurants, western-themed or otherwise. The serving was typical compared to other restaurants, too. They might want to get smaller plates for some of the menu items. There was more plate than food."}
{"text":"Got food to go to eat at a nearby bar.  The food was ready super fast and tasted good.  Should have just ate there... looked like a fun place."}
{"text":"My 2nd time here come here once a year for a car show and this is the best place for a ribeye stake and Pork Chops.  The service was excellent. Friendly staff and the manager came out to great his guest.  Will be back every year"}
{"text":"Wow. I have eaten at Saddle Ranch Chop House's other locations and I am shocked at the difference. Are these franchised? Service was not just bad- it was non-existent. On a slow Wednesday night I had to wait forever at the front (which was unmanned) without ever being acknowledged. Finally after 10 minutes I waived a waiter down who grabbed a menu and sat me, by myself, at a six-top that was crammed between two different parties of over a dozen people each. It ended up being SO LOUD I could barely think. I planned to ask for a different seat when a server came to get my drink, but *15* minutes later I still had not talked to anyone or even been given a water. I finally stood up and left and was never spoken to on the way out. Almost a half-hour of my time wasted. I drove to the other side of the plaza where I received great food and great service at Gordon Biersch."}
{"text":"Just had drinks here, but seems like it would be a fun environment as the night wears on."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to Saddle Ranch.Yesterday me and my family came here to eat. Our waiter was pretty good but another gentleman that came to help us named Johnny was amazing! He went above and beyond to serve us and my our experience that much better. The food and drinks were great! I will definitely be coming back here! THANKS JOHNNY!"}
{"text":"I went out here tonight with a couple of clients.  I had heard some good things about it, and they were from back East, so I thought to myself, \"why not?\"  I must admit I was not that impressed with it all.  We came here for dinner.  Started out with some apps, and ordered the Monster Platter.  Complete with \"sliders\" on it that rivaled a Jumbo Jack for shear size, this could easily feed a family of four for a week.  Thank God there were 10 of us.  Most everyone ordered steak for dinner, and most were impressed.  I, on the other hand, was not that impressed.  All I could taste on my steak was butter, not meat.  I almost had to reach for the A1 Sauce, a cardinal sin in my mind with steak, just to make it edible.  Since we all had a round of golf in the morning, none of us opted for the giant 3-liter beer option they had.  But the booze selection, including wine, was quite impressive.  Service all around was very attentive.  And for those of you that love your barely-18 and barely-100lbs servers that Scottsdale is serving up on a daily basis, this is a great place for you.  There were a few people in our group that opted for the bull ride, a nice little touch that gave this place that little something extra to set it apart from the other Old Town places.  All things considered, I don't think I'd head back here.  I can get a better steak at a Chili's-type place, and the atmosphere (comprised mainly of your younger Scottsdale-types) didn't really do all that much for me.  A couple other things of note:  their happy hour only goes until 6:30 (boo!!) but they do have a daily brunch that, strictly reading off the menu, did not look half bad.  I may have to check that out some day."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant.   Took over an hour to deliver the food.  We complain about how long everything is taking so they comp some cotton candy but take even longer to take it off the bill.   Stay away if you hungry."}
{"text":"Horrible! My wife ordered steak med well, it came rare the first time, med rare the second time and well done the third and last time. My steak was fine, but the fries were cold. Service wasn't the worst, but with a meal that bad, who cares. And we still had to pay for the over priced screwed up meal. Won't be back!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for lunch but never by choice.  It is a top pick for team lunches since it is right around the corner from my office building and they can easily accommodate a large group.   Despite what you make have heard (or seen) about Saturday nights, this place is really slow during the day, especially in the low tourist season.  It is kind of a cool place with the funky western decor and the whole urban cowboy thing going on but I just really don't care for the food.  It is a pretty boring menu and overall they seem to choose quantity over quality and that just doesn't do it for me.  So, why three stars you ask?  Well, I went here tonight for Happy Hour and actually had a pretty good time.  The appetizers were very tasty (quesadillas and onion rings for me) and everyone commented on how good the drinks were.  And everything was half price!  I got a giant size glass of Stella Artois (they have it on tap) so I was pretty happy.  The friendly bartender kept the party going with some free shots.  Albeit they were \"girly\" ones, more sugar than alcohol, but hey we did all have to drive home after all.  Well, not me actually; fortunately, I car pool."}
{"text":"We were in town for a baseball tourney. We made reservations for a party of over 50 and they were able to accommodate us. Manager indicated they put on extra staff to take care of us and they did just that. The food was great but the staff spoiled us.  They comp'd us some drinks and desserts. Food came out fast, hot and as ordered. Food was good and a reasonable price. Finished it off with a bunch of people in our group riding the mechanical bull. It was a great outing of food, drinks, and entertainment. Thanks for the great experience Saddle Ranch!"}
{"text":"I've been to saddleranch twice now. The first time was OK. The food was excellent and they give huge portions, but the service was sooo slow! We had to wait an inexcusable time to get our order taken and to get our check. And there were only 5 tables in the whole place. The second time was after a cardinals game, so it was busy. We waited 15 minutes for someone to come take our order. No one came so I went and asked. They said they would send someone. I excused it because they were busy. But we waited even longer and no one came so we left. After two bad experiences, I doubt I will go back."}
{"text":"We have been to the locations in CA many times and we were excited when we found a location here in AZ. The food is great, that hasn't changed. The jalapeño macaroni is absolutely amazing. Our first couple visits were great, we typically go before its busy or early on in happy hour. This past Sunday we went for lunch when it was far from bust. Our waiter came and introduced himself and was very friendly. However he seemed very distracted throughout our meal. Many of our requests such as asking for sweetener for tea were forgotten and he offered refills but didn't return with them for a good 15-20 min. I will say this is the first time we have had less than great service and by no means does that mean this particular waiter is bad, he just wasn't great on Sunday. Will always recommend this restaurant for great food."}
{"text":"This is a pretty fun place later at night.  It's really busy inside and everyone seems to be having a great time.  I think they have a pretty nice setup in terms of bar placement and actual tables/booths to sit at.  Most of them are positioned so you can see whatever crazy person decides to try their hand at the mechanical bull.  I hear they have smores here and I am totally going to try them one of these days."}
{"text":"Came here to meet friends. I had never been before. The waitress was extremely friendly and seemed to absolutely love her job. I had the pancakes (served all day). They were okay. I've had better, but I've also had worse. They came on a HUGE plate though, which was awesome. And the butter was amazing. It was some type of cinnamon honey butter. MMMMM. After we were done she brought us all gummy bear shots on the house. THEN she came out with their 3ft cotton candy tower. She said she was training one of the girls on the machine and thought we might enjoy it! Such superb service. Definitely pays to go on a non busy night ;)  I would definitely recommend this place. The foods not bad and the service is amazing. Oh, and you can ride an electric bull! What's not to love!?"}
{"text":"When I walked through the swinging doors around noon on a Sunday, I walked into Hooterville.  Think silicone, fake tans, bleached hair and  teeth and caked-on makeup.  And the men here overdose on testosterone: full of bulk and attitude.  Think sideways baseball hats, torn jeans, flip flops and gold.  Even at noon on a Sunday, they were on the hunt.    Joining me in alienation was my San-Franciscan friend.  We represented the world of natural size and color.  To bring ourselves comfort and escape in this fake world surrounding us, we discussed environmental concerns.    I got the Buffalo Chicken sandwich.  Commensurate with the theme here, this was the biggest breast I'd ever seen.  The sauce was super hot and tasty.  The baked beans had a southwestern flare - with crushed pepper.  My friend got the chili, which he said was slightly spicy hot but not temperature-hot.    I didn't attempt the bucking broncho, for many reasons, but one of them being that there was nothing on it to hold on to.  Too difficult for a delicate northerner like me."}
{"text":"My son and I decided to go to Saddle Ranch before a Coyotes game to grab some appetizers and a beer. After placing our order, the waitress came back and informed me that since there was a Coyotes game, they were not honoring their Happy Hour prices. You're kidding! Let's take advantage of the people coming to Westgate for a sporting event. There are too many choices in Westgate that DO honor Happy Hour to ever return to Saddle Ranch."}
{"text":"It's a bar.  You walk in, mechanical bull, TONS of guys, loud, huge beers, and GREAT lettuce wraps (They really did have great food)!!    I don't really have much to compare it to because this was my first place to visit in while in Arizona, but it was a fun place to start the night off at and have a few beers."}
{"text":"The chop house has a great name so you'd expect good grub or at least good meats.  Overall they serve up pretty decent entrees but average in flavor."}
{"text":"We had a party of 7 tonight... the food was OK but 2 people in our party got hair in their food. We told a busser or host that dropped off boxes, and he said he would let a manager know, but no one ever came to our table. Our check was 237.00 which we paid in full. We weren't trying to get free food, just wanted to let them know. Our server Hayley was friendly and attentive. Needless to say, we will not be coming back."}
