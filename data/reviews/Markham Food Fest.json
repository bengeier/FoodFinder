{"text":"Much smaller than the Night It Up! night market, but it's got everything needed to fulfill one's night market needs/cravings!  It could've used a couple more drinks booths though.  I noticed several places with no prices on their menus which kinda sucks!"}
{"text":"Was a smaller event, can definitely improve next year."}
{"text":"There's no variety, duplicates of the same food (skewers, takoyaki, etc). I ended up getting food at metro square instead"}
{"text":"This is an Asian food market on a much smaller scale than say Night It Up or Taste of Asia. The familiar smells of grilled meats and stinky tofu dominate the air. Many of the usual night market vendors are present (Chatime, Tea Shop 168, Formocha, Osaka original takoyaki, okonomiyaki, AA Grills raindrop cakes, Wei's smelly tofu, Mama Bear smelly tofu, and several of the grilled skewer purveyors). Kanto by Tita Flips was also present, selling calamansi ice tea and pork skewers.   Because this market occupies the parking lot at Metro Square, attendants direct drivers to park at the nearby Greek Orthodox Church parking lot. There is a main stage but there was no entertainment at the time hubby and I were there. Worth going to if you have time to spare this weekend but probably many won't spend a lot of time here (mainly because of the relatively fewer food options available)."}
{"text":"Smaller scale asian night. Short lines - finally got to try more than a couple things at one of these things without waiting too long. The one squid booth was mind blowing. some booths gave free samples too (phoenix crepe ice cream, beef balls) so that was cool! also got a free birthday noodle. noodle was so good wouldve paid for it. Takoyaki balls (japanese booth 6 for $7) was good. the cooked oyster booth was selling wintermelon juice which was yums. deep fried corn i would avoid. meat skewers 10 for $10 for lamb and chicken - nice spicy seasoning. there were 2 smelly tofu booths that we didnt try. there was a lot of price variance which was weird.. but we had a good time. annnnnnd finally Pokemon theme song was sung on stage. what a perfect food fest experience!"}
{"text":"When we got there we followed the signs to parking at church across the street. As we enter the parking a volunteer attendant said there was few spaces left so we could go elsewhere or go in and try and find a spot. We went in and there were tons of spaces left. The festival itself had less booths than other festivals which means less crowded and no lineups. However there were some booths that had no signs and others had signs only in Chinese (luckily my wife translated for me). I tried the Tokayoki balls which were unfortunately cold and tried the chocolate caramel bacon waffle with sea salt which was delicious. If they decide to repeat this festival they have to look at how to improve it."}
{"text":"This event is smaller than Night it Up which has one fringe benefit... it was less crowded.  This venue provides no seating, so people come and go more readily.  After the initial influx in the mornings and lunch hours the crowds quickly dissipate.  I could tell since I can see the venue from my condo so I can choose an appropriate time to go.  One thing about the venue this time compared to some other time I *approached* it was the stinky tofu smell wasn't too strong.  I recall one time they had the smell so strong I just turned around once I reached the corner.  They have a good selection of food, but nothing unique.  There are some that are misses and cheaper for a good reason.  e.g. the $3 tornado fries vs the $9 tornado fries in the next store, the $3 one I got left much to be desired.  Another miss after a long wait was the $10 squid tepanyaki.  It smelled so good while they were making it but the end result was so rubbery I didn't enjoy it much.  Honorable mentions:   I had the deep fried onigiri.  $7 for 2.  I liked the fact that it had a crispy texture and was enjoying it but realizing that there was absolutely nothing inside but rice was a major disappointment.  Fried tofu in volcano sauce ($8 but $15 with drink and takoyaki combo) somehow they made this crispy for a relatively long period in the sauce.  The sauce had a mild kick to it but blends well with the crispness of the tofu.  The lemonade drink with mint wasn't bad either.  Top 3:  The Osaka okonomiyaki for $7 was pretty good.  However, I knew this store from work so I am biased in it.  It was crispy and considering we ate this AFTER everything else we didn't feel bloated.  This was my 3rd favorite.  The Vietnamese (I am guessing from their script) Oh Ah Jen (fried oyster pancake) was quite good.  I don't think I had an oyster pancake like that before (perhaps it's not something I commonly order at Pho places) but it was different from the HK places that's for sure.   It had bean sprouts (which I don't normally like) but it had large chunks of oysters and the sprouts covered some of the sauce's flavors so it didn't get too strong.  This was my number 2  The i-migo takoyaki was probably the best takoyaki I've had even compared to the ones I had in the Little Japan at the Philippines and J-Town's events.  It was like a cream puff but instead of the pastry, it was takoyaki batter and instead of ice cream it was a bunch of takoyaki stuff.  This is my number 1 favorite in the event.  Unfortunately, there are a number of lower class people smoking around and this includes the staff at some of the stalls specific example was at i-migo which I just had to tolerate to get their takoyaki.  Some suggestions for a future event.  #1 get their security to deal with smokers especially among the staff. #2 disallow booths from putting up their own blaring music (I had to deal with that with the i-migo booth) #3 provide free wifi for the occasion #4 provide a Yelp review meter for each booth along with a QR code so we can rate. #5 manage the wash stalls better, there was no water in them 2 hours before closing time. #6 put in a Legendary Pokemon hunt.  Pro-tip: go to Gong-Cha for tea afterwards, much better drink and you can start writing your reviews because they have free wifi and seating.  Not to mention have a fully plumbed sink and toilet if needed."}
