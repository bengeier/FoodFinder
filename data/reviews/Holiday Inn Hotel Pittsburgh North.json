{"text":"The room was clean and nice, with mini fridge and microwave, but the hotel bar closes at 10pm and the paid breakfast buffet was horrible, with both service and quality of food. It's a decent room at a decent price, but I won't eat here if I stay here again."}
{"text":"The room was okay and they have an outdoor pool, but the breakfast buffet which you have to pay $10 each for was awful! Runny eggs and way overpriced. Coffee not included. My husband and I spent over $20 on a really crap breakfast and left hungry and disappointed. The room service was awesome and the maid I spoke to was really friendly and great to talk to. If I stay here again, I will definitely skip eating in the hotel \"restaurant\"."}

Holiday Inn Hotel Pittsburgh North is not a bad hotel if you just want somewhere that has free parking, free wifi and a place to sleep....

Aside from that, I don't think I would suggest staying here.

The gentleman at the front that check me in though is really nice... but the hotel's common area desperately need some renovation. One of the elevators were not even working during our stay....

The room though is decent, clean and have been recently refurbished. 

If the price is right, I don't mind staying here again, only if the price is right!"}
