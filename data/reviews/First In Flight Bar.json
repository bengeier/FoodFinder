{"text":"Well I did like to come here. If you don't mind the absolutely rude bartender the food is good. 
Again, people DON'T like being disrespected. I fly through here almost every other week. Too bad I did like the place."}
{"text":"First off, just so people are aware, the First in Flight Bar shares the same space with Hissho Sushi.  In any event, sweetie and I went there for a quick lunch while in the airport.

-1 star for a full sake list on the menu but no actual sake available (none?  Not even one of the fifteen choices you have on the list?).

-1 star for old wasabi and the tiny amount of spicy salmon in the spicy salmon roll.  

-1 star for paying $3.50 for a tiny bowl of rice.  Honestly, that rice cost you about $0.30 to cook and prepare.  So, that makes your markup about 1166%.  That is kind of egregious - reminds me of the business practices of many banks.  I was all set to give you a 3 star review, but this one really annoyed me.

The sushi is average quality.  If you absolutely must have your fix, it will serve you, but otherwise, perhaps once of the other places might be a better value option."}
{"text":"A regular stop of mine when traveling through CLT.  The food is regularly of good quality, the takeaway selection is great, the staff are friendly and my service is always quick. 

My most recent stop in was just last week - picked up a roll for takeaway as I only had 30m between connecting flights.  The restaurant is located in an open area of the main 'between terminal wings' area so there isn't an enclosed seating area - the closest you can get to outdoor seating while being inside an airport terminal.  

Being that the customers are usually on the way to somewhere else, the staff are used to serving at a pace to keep everyone moving it seems.  Not in a pushy way to get you out, just swift enough to keep you moving on time to your final destination.  

The sushi won't make you sick and it is a refreshing change from the usual fare of deep-fried and greasy food you get in airport terminals."}
{"text":"Airport Sushi probably doesn't sound like a wise choice, but it was actually pretty good.  Grabbed a quick lunch before flight took off.  Had the Tuna on seaweed salad and pork gyoza for heartiness.  The Tuna was good, they give you a decent portion in a martini glass with seaweek salad on the bottom.  The tuna wasn't swimming in spicy mayo which was great, it had a light dressing on it and just your typical seaweek salad.  Very flavorful and not as heavy as having a sushi roll, so at least when you get on your flight you're not weighed down.  The gyoza was just a standard gyoza but I ordered it in case the tuna wasn't enough to keep me full, so at least this way I had a bit of meat for heartiness."}
{"text":"First it at airport but no excuses here. Wonderful sushi and best choice at airport. Little on expensive side especially drinks but food is high quality. Recommend the clt role if you like your rolls a bit spicy. Try it whe in clt between terminal b and c you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a sushi joint in an airport, so you have to drop your expectations just a little bit. Now normally I am fine with low expectations, but the prices here are what you'd expect to pay for pretty decent sushi - not frozen fish. No disrespect to the chef, since the menu was fun and the rolls were creative, but charging $15 for a roll made with frozen tuna isn't gonna earn you a high review.  Expect grocery-store sushi taste.

This is a great place for people watching, which almost earns it 3 stars.  But not quite."}
{"text":"The black dragon roll is great. Seems like a popular watering hole for ppl on layovers.

Staff is ok. Took me a while to get my water and I was already super dehydrated from traveling. On top of that, she also didn't listen when I asked for water without ice. Eek!"}
{"text":"TIP: Sit at the bar. Under the counter is a power strip. All seats, all the way around. Plug in, then get a draft and a roll. Watch TV. Play on your phone. Whatever.

And that my friends, is enough reason for four stars. The sushi is okay. The prices are okay. You won't rave, you won't get sick, and you won't be hungry afterwards."}
{"text":"during a layover at CLT, stopped by this place after getting attracted by their neat menu cards. Seeing the sushi bar and drinks bar, i was expecting good sushi and was not disappointed. Ordered a cold sake and sushi. Both were very tasteful. lookng forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"Big pieces of sashimi, but not very much flavor.  Kirin ichiban is on tap, but its $7 per beer!  not great but it is nice to have a sushi bar in the airport."}
{"text":"Waited ten minutes for any of the six people working that day to even make eye contact with me as I sat at the bar. Nobody did. So f*ck 'em, I took my money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Very mediocre fish and all drinks and dishes are served in one-time use plastic. I really hope that they recycle."}
{"text":"When in Charlotte, enjoy some sushi instead of the typical overpriced fast food normally found in airports.  It is pricey, but no worse than any other sushi bar.  I recommend the Tuna Poke.  Served in a Martini glass and SO delicious.  Perfect place to spend a layover."}
{"text":"It is what it is.  The sushi isn't amazing, but its still probably one of the best deals on food in Charlotte Airport.  That doesn't make it a good deal, just one considering where your at.  I figured it up and there was a bento box that saved you a couple bucks over buying the items seperately.

The seaweed salad and spicy tuna was good, the fish was fresh, and the chefs were really quick with it.

All this said, if I paid this much for mediocre sushi at a regular restaurant, this would be a 1-2 star review."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a minor layover in the Charlotte airport.  Since we flew in from Vegas via coach, we were hungry.  There were several of the normal airport venues, i.e. - fast food.  We saw the sushi bar and decided to give it a try.  I ordered 2 Kirin drafts and they were $7.50 each!  My wife had two glasses of Ecco Domani Pinot Grigio at $9.50 a clip.  I realize it's an airport but geez.

Anyhow, we ordered the Sky Captain Sashimi, the CLT roll, and the Queen CLT.  All were excellent.  The Queen CLT features a light tempura batter.  The CLT was different than most rolls we've ever had.  My wife doesn't eat sashimi so I had the Sky Captain by myself.  It was great and the jalapenos are a nice touch.

Overall, very good.  Too pricey, but good.  Service can be a little slow but sushi takes time and they seem to do a brisk business."}
{"text":"Quick service, large portions.  One Roll can feed two.  Quick get in and out when you are tight for a connector.  Hissho Sushi is the actual Sushi Bar at that location."}
{"text":"Nice surprise at an airport. Nice presentation of fresh, large portions. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This was extremely good, hit the spot and not outrageously priced. Great fresh sushi and the atmosphere is outstanding for an airport (the piano nearby really helps too)."}
{"text":"Not bad for quick bite, I order eel roll because I looked at fish I don't like way looks so order some cook fish for safe side.  my flight is late afternoon good place to have few drink and bite for sure. But I like my sushi better"}
{"text":"Many times I have passed this fairly new outpost at CLT, but I had 20 minutes to snack and found a spot at the bar for a quick bite and drink. I had the CLT roll, and a glass of Kim Crawford wine. Aimee my server had it on my plate in no time. Despite the all disposable glass and plate ware I was very impressed. Back next week, do they do sushi for breakfast?"}
{"text":"15 % discount for military .  A great location and great service.  Thanks Antoine!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good sushi for an airport bar. Moreso than the food, I was impressed with the bartender Antoine. He was extremely personable for someone who is only talking to people in between their flights. Overall great food and great service. I'll be back next time I fly through Charlotte."}
{"text":"Decent sushi and pretty quick service. It's not the best sushi you will ever have and not the worst. I gave 4 stars based on speed and service. It's a nice alternative to burgers and pizza."}
{"text":"I have passed this place oh so many times & it was only recently that I finally had enough time to actually sit at CLT Airport to grab a bite....This was definitely the place.
The sushi was just so delicious. Very fresh, large, and full of flavor. Great menu selection. I selected the price section as \"spendy\" because I am adding on an appetizer & optional beverage.

Nothing like a hot saki, cold beer, and yummy sushi to enjoy before getting on a packed plane."}
{"text":"I never would've expected to have such great Sushi in an airport. The set up was cool, it's pretty much in the middle of the terminal, there are windows surrounding the area so you can watch planes coming/going. It's situated in the middle of the terminal where you can see the hustle and bustle of travelers, which was nice because I'm a city girl & I love to people watch. While at the bar we noticed how delicious the orders looked and decided to order our own. I would have to say that this was some of the best sushi that I've ever had. Everything was fresh, the service was awesome & the prices weren't too bad. I can't wait to have another layover here, I will hope to dine here again."}
{"text":"Quick review: nice service (Thanks Gemma!), fresh sashimi, but it is not the best quality (as I would have expected). Still four solid stars. Would I try it again? Yes, I would!"}
{"text":"Really good sushi. Different choices than your average sushi place. $7.99 for a 20oz beer, but it's an airport. Love stopping at CLT just for First in Flight. Southern Charm Roll taste American, but is really good"}
{"text":"after being in disgusting tequilera or taqueria pronto! mexican food definitely need a drink specially since this places are all disgusting.  i have a bitter taste in my mouth after ordering eating half my food before i throw it away. disgusting restaurant.

this bar people is very friendly drinks are very good good price good service deserves good tip always. i recommended for all of you don't have an idea what to eat or drink well this is the place something fast."}
{"text":"Best airport sushi I have ever had, hands down. Be careful with the CLT roll, it is SPICY!"}
{"text":"The service was fast as long as you have Ruth as a server. I had a combo platter and started off with Miso soup. It came out hot and steamy and was a nice size portion. I had two pieces of Salmon Nigiri along with a Maki roll of spicy tuna. It was delicious but it did not hold together well. I was presented my check as soon as I finished which allowed me to get to my gate without any issues or being late.  The food was fresh, fast and tasty. That is impressive for an airport meal!'I will be back."}
{"text":"Ok, if this place was in Downtown Charlotte my review would be different.  It's in an airport folks so I go in with low expectations.

Let's face it most airport food, is overpriced and crappy.  First in Flight was actually pretty good.  For what you get it is reasonably priced and probably the best value at Clt Douglas airprt.

Service was quick and the sushi was fresh and flavorful.  The rolls were pretty typical.  It's right in the center of the main terminal so there's plenty of scenery for you to enjoy while you're eating.

I fly out of CLT pretty often and will definitely come back here vs. venturing down a concourse for something else."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Charlotte NC Airport to eat the sushi is incredibly good and service is always first class. I recommend the southern charm roll."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good service.
The salmon salad is amazing, good combination ingredients.
Good option for airport meals"}
{"text":"I have flown through here a couple of times and debates if I wanted to get Sushi here. After reading several reviews I finally caved in. I ended up getting prepackaged rolls, salmon avocado and tuna rolls so I can't judge the freshly made stuff. At best they were just below average and rather flavorless. The wasabi was weak and fake (horseradish, mustard and peppers.) And the prepackaged stuff also has very little ginger but they will give you more of you just ask. Prices were reasonable for the amount you get especially at an airport. About $8 for each tray which had 16 small pieces. In the end. The it wasn't terrible but will try something else when I'm here again."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick bite before your next flight this is a decent spot to grab a sushi roll. I didn't want to eat another burger and fries and needed something light.

The service is super fast. I sat at the bar, the bartender quickly grabbed my drink and kept an eye on me until I was ready to order. I got the Ocean's Delight roll with tuna, yellow tail, salmon, avocado, cucumber, and lettuce. It came out in less than 10min! Some of the fastest sushi I've ever had, but in fact that does have an impact on the end product. It was decent. The rolls were thinly sliced and the rice was bland. It needed soy sauce to give it a boost. Of course, being airport sushi it was expensive for an ok final product - $13 for the roll (8 pieces). But if you're going to get airport sushi, this spot is worth a stop."}
{"text":"Airport sushi?  Sounds scary, but is pretty yummly! - careful though, the wasabi here almost catches on fire.  The CLT Roll is very tasty, so next time you're in the Charlotte airport have a little treat in the noisy, crazy atrium."}
{"text":"First in Flight used to be a bunch of tables and a bar, but as of a couple months ago, it expanded into a sushi-piano bar serving sashimi, special rolls, and a variety of beers/cocktails. Rolls run between $8-$12. Apps include Edamame, Seaweed and Squid Salad, Tuna Poke and Sashimi plates ($5-$8).

Our waitress, Amber, is a little on the slow side with the turnaround for food/drinks, but she is one of the nicest waitresses I have ever met! The sushi is probably a 2 star, but if you're craving it you may as well come here since Charlotte sushi options are dismal. You also won't find anything even close to sushi in this airport unless you want to get some broccoli beef at Mandarin Express. Yeah.... not the same.

I would recommend the Sky Captain because the yellow tail in ponzu sauce is quite fresh. The seaweed salad is what you would expect and served in a decently sized portion for airport standards for $5. The Orville is pretty good but has alot of sweet sauce on top. The Queen Charlotte is not bad, but kind of bland because it's composed of a bland soggy tempura shrimp. And the International Roll would probably be my favorite because I love eel and it's hard to mess up eel.

If I have any recommendations for the business, I would improve the quality of the sushi rice."}
{"text":"No need to look at menu, get the Take-off roll, it is awesome!  Centrally located at Charlotte airport, this bar is also a sushi bar and is very quick and very good!"}
{"text":"Anyone who gives this place a positive review has never had real sushi - this place is disgusting. My mistake for thinking sushi at an airport would be a good idea."}
{"text":"I've been here several times in the last few years, and it is hit or miss.  This time was not good.  The portion was very good for the price, location and people watching is great, and servers were very friendly.  But the sushi was grocery store quality or worse.  The shrimp tempura is not fried on site and is prepackaged in a huge bag, pulled from the refrigerator, piled onto a plate about four deep, then microwaved and set onto the kitchen prep area.  When it is served inside a roll, all you can taste is soggy breading. The spicy crab topping was even worse and had the consistency of finely chopped up bread wth orange food coloring.  I'll pass next time."}
{"text":"This place has mediocre sushi but was quick and easy. The seafood looks like it's coming out of a freezer and the wine selection wasn't nearly as impressive as the place next door, but it was a decent meal. I definitely do not recommend the seaweed salad, though."}
{"text":"i pass through this airport quite often. Why do I have to sit there for 10 minutes while 3 chefs are jaw jacking with one guy while I am. ...sitting. ......right. ...there?!!! You lost my business. Customer service. ..STINKS!"}
{"text":"I was very surprised how fresh the Sushi rolls where for being in a airport restaurant. I couldn't give them a five star ratting because of the lack of knowledge the the waitress had at the table service. I suggest grabbing something from the case and then sitting down to eat it."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! I have layovers in Charlotte almost every week but was too hesitant to try until yesterday (I knew I was about to face another week of trying to live off of omelets and Burger King salads in Tallahassee because I refuse to eat fried chicken and grits... yes that is all they serve here). Menu is nothing spectacular, but has all the basics. I ordered 2 salmon rolls and edamame. Salmon was fresh and the rice was perfect. Edamame was... edamame. Servers were extremely nice and helpful (although that could just be because I'm in no way accustomed to southern hospitality). Expect to pay $1-2 more per roll than you would if you were A) not in an airport, and B) not in Charlotte, NC."}
