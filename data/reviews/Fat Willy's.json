{"text":"Went on Sunday, 2 football games on TV. One being a Arizona cardinals game. Place was half full....why? The food was terrible. Example, jalape√±o poppers made with red peppers and the dip was sweet and sour sauce. Not very appetizing!  Good thing happy hour is seven days a week, but don't go if you are hungry"}
{"text":"Our first time here and we ordered the French dip and nachos. Epic fail!!!! The French dip was on hard bread with stale tasting dry dog meat strips!!! Oh and the nachos..ewwwww....the cheese sauce was sour and gross.. Never again"}
{"text":"I go there because it is close to home.  I have never been happy with the food there.  The nacho's were dry, stale, and flavorless.  The hot wings vary from time to time.  I will say the beer is always ice cold.  I would go more often if the place was more fun.  I moved from Tempe to east Mesa, so my expectations are high.  The staff is friendly and the beer is cold."}
{"text":"Some of the worst service I have ever experienced! Decided on this \"sports bar\" to watch the Big 12 Basketball Championship.  When we entered we asked the server which TV would have the game on, he said we could sit anywhere because the bartender, Landon, would turn on whatever we game wanted, since only a few people were there.  We sat at the bar by a TV that no one was watching and asked if the game could be turned on.  He said no because it was already on one TV, and pointed to the TV at the opposite end of the bar where the only other people in the place were sitting.    We moved to a table that had a fair view of the TV and he took our order.  It appeared that the idea of having to wait on anybody was the most painful thing he had ever experienced.  We got our beer, which was not very cold and ordered food.  He was unfamiliar with menu, but our food came as ordered.  It was okay, typical bar food.  I finished my beer at the midpoint of the first half and it wasn't until half time that he asked if I would like another, by that point I had decided we would be moving to another establishment with far better service to spend our money. If the place was packed, I could understand it, but it was far from that.   We will not be returning to this place!"}
{"text":"Service very slow. I ordered all you can eat fish.30 minutes wait before the order got there then another 25 minutes before they would get to the next 2 pieces they would bring out. They nevered asked for drink refills until they saw we were getting frustrated and wanted to leave.There's almost 2 hours of my life I won't get back. Just for fish and a burger. Stopped and got a burger on the way home."}
{"text":"Moved to Chandler about a month ago and this place is about a 5 minute walk from my house. Been here 3 times so far, the food is above average, haven't had anything amazing yet but the burgers are really good, and only $5 on Mondays (I think?) The wings are good too. They have a great happy hour that goes till 7pm, $4 for a 25 oz premium beer, and other specials on Sundays during football. Lots of TVs in the bar area. I have a feeling I will be frequenting this place often!"}
{"text":"Really, Monday night and the patio with 2 TV's, they have CLE vs KC baseball, and the other TV is OFF!"}
{"text":"Second review...if you want to just hang out and have a beer then by all means come here. Wednesday night trivia is fun, but don't go here if you expect stellar food. I can't for the life of me understand why people say the food is \"stellar\" here. Last night a group of us went in after a long day at work and I ordered the \"Port Wine Burger\". The waitress said \"it's really melty\"...sounded good and I was starving. The \"port wine cheese\" that I made the mistake of thinking would be actual cheese was in fact port wine cheese SPREAD akin to the cracker spread in the tub. SERIOUSLY?? The burger itself was cooked fine and was seasoned. I ordered sweet potato fries as a side and they were not only way overcooked (or had been sitting over a fryer for to long) and cold. My friend also ordered the sweet potato fries and hers were the same. We asked for a new batch and the ones that came out were obviously fresh made and you could see the difference...wish now that I would have taken a pic to share to compare the difference! Why on earth would you serve the old ones?? So far the only things I have actually like there food wise is the Southwest Cobb and the fried zucchini....not much else. They have plenty of draft beers to choose from including some craft beers, so go for the beer, but save your money for food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Can not say it enough... We love this restaurant! The bar staff has to be hands down one of the most friendliest staffs in the valley. If you are in the area go there and ask for Mike he is a very cool guy as well as very knowledgeable on all sports!!!"}
{"text":"When we moved to the neighborhood we saw Fat Willys and just knew it was going to be our new \"spot\". I really tried to like the place because frankly there's not much to chose from! Sadly, the servers there are always miserable and if anything goes wrong with the food the managers are defensive and are not equip to handle a customer complaint. My husband and I ordered 2 meals to share and after one bite of the wrap my husband said \"omg the tortilla tastes like fish\". I absolutely hate seafood so this smell is very pungent to me. I took one whiff and felt ill. We told the server something wasn't right with it and the manager came over and argued that there's no way that fish could get on the wrap. Unfortunately for him we have both been in the industry for over 17 years. I could see the whole thing play out in my mind.. Cook cuts up fish for a meal and then rolls up our wrap on the same board. So gross. Another day I ordered a salad that was listed to have 2 different fruits, crutons, cheese and dressing. I literally was served a plate of lettuce and cheese with no dressing and she walked away before I could stop laughing to ask where my salad was?? They ended up being out of all fruit and crutons and I paid full price for lettuce and cheese. I have had some good food here so I give 2 stars. My biggest issue is the unfriendly servers.  Tried it out again. I guess we are gluttons for punishment. Again with an unfriendly bartender. Seems the customers are an annoyance to your wait staff. The burger was pretty good actually but then we decided to try the new cheesecake crumbles dessert. We paid our tab while waiting on the dessert and after 15 mins I asked her to box it because we had to leave and she decided she would just bring it out not boxed. We asked for a box to do it ourselves and as I was boxing it there were approximately 6 full size stale as shit graham crackers with a tablespoon of what appeared to be a cheese flavored pudding with a crap ton of nasty raspberry syrup. We threw it right in the trash. My husband and I continue to leave 20% tips for the staff hoping we can brighten a servers day because it must suck to work there."}
{"text":"The food was ok. I ordered mozzarella sticks and chips and salsa. The service was ok, we were never asked if we wanted another beer, and also had to ask for our check multiple times while sitting at the bar. I did like their draft beer selection."}
{"text":"Great experience!! Bridgett was excellent, very thorough and attentive!! Always enjoy hanging out...awesome happy hour & Golden Tee! We've become regulars!"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delicious! We got the southwest eggrolls, pizza rolls, a couple California burger, buffalo chicken sandwich, and the club. Everything was perfect! The service was excellent! The manager, John, what a great guy. He's a man with many talents and makes you feel welcomed as if it was his kitchen in his house.  Absolutely awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Plain and simple ... Heed the warnings don't go here. Poor service, poor food quality, and they don't honor their coupons. Good Luck!"}
{"text":"Food has good portions and tastes great. The service was good too. Friendly. I would only recommend going on the days with deals though. Check the website. Music is a bit loud"}
{"text":"My friend and I had lunch here  yesterday. I ordered the Flatbread pizza.  This was the absolute worst Flatbread pizza I have ever had.  The crust was very hard. The basil was dried to a crisp. The basil leaves were still on the stems. The stems are very bitter and should not be used. Very few tomatoes. It was almost cold when I got it. Our server  had an attitude  and never once asked if we needed drink refills or would like desert. I had never been to this  restaurant before and will never come back. What a horrible and expensive experience!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Excellent weekend happy hour and game day specials. Great service- waitress Jessica was excellent during busy dinner rush. Friendly , efficient & great food!  Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is very close to us so we go there occasionally, they have great food and friendly staff I would highly recommend it"}
{"text":"How do you not have Coors Light. 2nd time in a year that they have been out of it. Shame on who does y the buying. Burgers are good tho."}
{"text":"No thank you! Fat Willy's lost a customer today! We used to be a big fan of this burger joint, despite the wait for food (always seemed a little long). Today we had several bad experiences that resulted in is leaving before we were served our meal. First, we ordered an appetizer and it took 25 minutes to arrive. The appetizer. Second, we were given two different kids menus. When we ordered an item off the menu (kids pasta) we were told they didn't have it anymore. After a few minutes we ordered something different only to be told they didn't have the side we asked for (fruit! ON THE MENU) Settled on mashed potatoes... They think they have those! 5 minutes later the server came back and said they don't have those either. He said the menu has changed some! They took the firecracker burger off and people were mad about it, he said. I asked why they changed- new chef? New owner? No, I think the owner just wanted to shake things up, he said. He also said he heard not everything changed at all locations, just some! Whatever... We were there after the lunch rush- one of only two tables the entire time.  25 minutes after ordering our APPETIZER, it finally came. (Oh by the way- no Alfredo sauce anymore, only pizza sauce for the garlic knots. Menu changed, apparently) 40 minutes after ordering our ENTR√âES, my husband kindly told them we would pay for our appetizer and drinks but that we did not want the food and we would be leaving. They food just happened to be ready, so they boxed it up for us and sent it with us.  The entire time we sat there we only saw our server when we ordered, when he came to tell us something we ordered was not on the menu, or when he brought drinks/appetizer. No checking on our drink refill status or apologizing for the ridiculously long wait. The food was mediocre. My burger was not medium, nor was it hot. The garlic knots were smaller than they used to be and not soft (overlooked like the burger, maybe?) I tend to give people the benefit of the doubt, and really hate to give a negative review to anyone, but this one got me fired up today.  Hate that for ya, Fat Willy. We were big fans before today, but you lost our business and we will likely share our experience if your name ever comes up in conversation with our friends."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Go here all the time.   Pizza and garlic bread are of the hook.   Love the bartenders, always great service. Breakfast on Saturdays and Sundays is better than Dennys.   It's my usual go to place."}
{"text":"2nd visit to this establishment....ordered the pot roast sandwich.  The bread was dripping in grease.  The \"chunks\" of pot roast in the sandwich were huge.  too big even for a man.  So I took them out to cut them up. Had to saw thru them with the regular knife,  there was so much fat and gristle,,,eek!  was horrible.  The waitress had no emotions whatsoever,  she never came back to table after we were served.  When she came to bring the check I told her about the pot roast and showed her the huge inedible pieces with fat and gristle.  She grabbed the check off the table and left.  She came back about 5 min. later and \"slapped\" the check down and walked away, not even a word.  We found that my entree had been removed.   Also.....I will never go back just because of the dirt we noted on the window sills and blinds, they were filthy!!!"}
{"text":"This is just another no value overpriced bs restaurant, where the employees, think being cool, and exclusive, except with the other employees.  Quite freindly amongst themselves.   Dissapointing...maybe a question why didnt you eT much of your food.  Would help iton out some quality and service problems.."}
{"text":"Another disappointing visit to this Fat Willy's. The customer service is just as horrific as the food. After many second chance visits, this will be my last visit due the extremely bad customer service .  Management  only seems concerned with being right rather than making customers feel heard. I tried to inquire   as to why my drinks did not fall in line with the happy hour information   listed on the menu and instead of speaking   to me   to try and understand   why I would   interpret my drinks   to be a price   different   than what I was charged, the manager on duty chose to argue with me over   two dollars. I would like to report that this was the first time I have had issues with customer service, bad sadly this is the only thing   constant about this restaurant , poor service."}
{"text":"The quality of the food here is definitely average if not far below it. When I got to the pick up window there was already three other unhappy customers waiting in front of me. They got my order wrong and looked irritated when I corrected them. Then she asked me what I wanted them to do about it. Obviously I want what I ordered. By the time I got home I took one bite and spit it right back out. My salad basically smelled like a wet dish rag that had been sitting out too long and tasted like it too. Lovely huh? And my friends bun to his burger was soggy, the lettuce was completely wilted and the cheese was almost burnt. On a small positive note, the loaded fries are pretty good, and the only thing I've been 100% satisfied with. The fries will be the ONLY thing we come back here for if we ever come back at all........."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped on Monday for the burger deal - a discount off the regular prices, down to only $6.00 with fries when you buy a beverage.  Great size burgers with awesome flavor combinations.  I had the Black & Bleu which was a blackened burger with bleu cheese melted on top.  Excellent.  My wife had the Port Wine burger, which for you Wisconsin folks, is a Merkt's Port Wine cheese spread across the top.  This is a great flavor mixture.  Burgers are grilled to your order request (we had medium) and are nice and juicy.  This is a great place to relax with a tall beer while watching sports available on the numerous TVs throughout.  Stop at Fat Willy's !!!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast and was very disappointed.  We waited an hour and 15 minutes for our food.  Our server was apologetic many times  and she did comp our bill  That is why I rated it 2 stars.  There were maybe 6 tables when we we ordered.  I think if they are going to offer breakfast on weekends they should staff their kitchen accordingly to accommodate for it otherwise, dont server breakfast..."}
{"text":"This place was ok.  Not great, and not bad because of their cheap drinks and Happy Hour 7 days a week!  That is always a bonus.    2-7 or 2-6 not sure.  The sign on the front door says 2-7, but their menus inside state 2-6?   $3 drinks $4 apps $2 domestic pints $3 large drafts (large) $3 import pints $4 large (large)  except for Guiness, which everybody failed to tell me.  I even specifically asked about the imports, and nobody said \"except Guiness\"  I had the spin/artichoke dip, and it was good for $4, not the best ever, but decent.  The service at the bar was very bad.  the 3 girls behind the bar didn't pay any attention too us, we were sitting at the bar! They do not have any tv's on their smoking patio, but at least they have a smoking patio with sound.   They have lots of really nice big flat screen tv's.  Nice enough place, but bad service, great drinks/tv's. That was my first time there on Sunday, so things were busy for football, and I don't know how new the bartenders were, but I've bartended before, and I go to bars alot, and maybe I just can't stress how out of it these girls were.  Oh, and they have a bloody mary bar on Sunday mornings/afternoon with $3 Smirnoff, but by the time we got there (3pm) all the condiments had been raveged, and the only mixer they have is Clamato?  (Lame)  Good enough place to go watch sports games.   I will def go there again, and update if things change.  Their website notes all the daily specials and Happy Hour info, but they don't have a way to contact them on their site, as I was going to let them know of the poor service I received."}
{"text":"This place is a gross bar and grill that serves bellow average food for high prices. Service is bad. This should be on bar rescue."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time there.  The first time was a better experience, friendlier, and lots of smiles.The waiters/waitress are good w/great attitudes, but the owner needs to work on being nice to us patrons, and his employees. The bar does have a great selection of beers, and the additional TV's that were put in since Red, White, and Brew were here are a good touch. Food was ok, but didn't care for the loud music! Very noisy!"}
{"text":"This place is a good choice for food!  We had the boneless wings which were very tasty. We also got the meat lovers pizza. It was extremely cheesy but was very good.   Service was great and very helpful. We went on Thursday night and it wasn't too busy around 6.   I would come back multiple times."}
{"text":"I was thrilled to find Fat Willy's had opened up in this location. It is the closest sports bar to our house (in the horribly underserved area of  SE Chandler. We've been there a few times and the food and service are good. The staff is friendly and courteous.   The only complaint I have is that on our last visit (last night) there were some children who were running around screaming and playing grab***. I don't blame Fat Willy's, I blame the parents. Their lack of parenting skills dampened an otherwise good meal.  Not to worry, we'll go back."}
{"text":"dropped in late last night. food was good! Bridget was great with the service and the manager even came over to introduce him self and made sure our first visit was going well."}
{"text":"For the price the food here is average at the best.  I think I could spend 40 dollars for a lunch more wisely in the future.  Onion rings were soggy and the taste of the food wasn't that spectacular.   The staff there has been nice and the beer is cold.  I wouldn't go back to eat, just a beer or two."}
{"text":"Been here twice, 1st time was all around good. This 2nd visit, well server was the only thing worthwhile.  Burger was bland and mediocre and the fries were over cooked. We were first in the door at 11 am when they opened. No toilet paper in the womens bathroom and used tp on floor behind toilet and wastebasket.  Also, if you're gonna have a movie on the tvs in a sports bar, at least put on the caption please."}
{"text":"Last night i sit at the bar table. I was waiting for a drink. Bartener ingored me. I waved and said hello!?!  I ordered honey bbq wings.   gave me cold wings. I told bartner wings cold. bartner said oh im sorry.  gave me hot wings.  I didnt say anything. i dont know why give me wrong food. I was so pissed. I told bartener honey bbq. DUH!!!  Hot wings was okay. I will not go there."}
{"text":"You have to try the southwest egg rolls with the avocado ranch! So good! We come here just for them. Staff is friendly. Check this place out! Also they allows dogs on the patio! Love that"}
{"text":"Eat here Monday's!!! $6 any burger! This place is a well oiled machine! Always great food, service!!"}
{"text":"Beware the chicken wings Normally have good food at Fat Willy's but tonight had chicken wings that were bloody inside so did not eat them.  The manager stated they follow double frying procedures and said he would let us know what happened.  He never came back.  We paid for what we had eaten and left very disappointed.  Please beware and check the chicken so it does not happen to you."}
{"text":"The best ribs & wings! The absolute best burgers!! & The BEST SERVICE, all the server's & bartenders were great, very friendly. Went in monday it was 5 dollar burger deal going on all day, any burger $5, I grabbed the port wine burger, very good! you do have to purchase a drink to get the deal but that's alright.. We came in the next day and got our girl Jenn G, she is great! and made the BEST drinks as well you can tell she's been slingin drinks for quite a while she's awesome, not to mention fun & FUNNY as all hell. any way this time I had the ribs & fries very flavorful, my girlfriend had the regular wings in some honey hot, again very good! the rest of our group grabbed the boneless wings in parmy garlic and a mango (something) I think mango habanero it had a kick to it, but they were bomb! soo good. Also they have the best ranch! The only thing I would say is the food this time took a little long (20 min) but we could see they were busy. Great selection of beers and there happy hour is the best I've seen for a while, let me emphasize that, THE BEST !! The service there is great in general! It's such a laid back friendly & fun place to chill with your family or friends!!!"}
{"text":"Fish fry all you can eat. Cod is great. It that time of year for lunch on the patio. nice service."}
{"text":"This establishment is horrible!  Service was TERRIBLE, main entrees arrived 20 MINUTES apart, the chicken wings were the size of turkey legs, mushy,  and the wing sauce had a strange bitter taste.  The waitress took her sweet time doing anything, we had to ask for refills on our drinks, waiting so long that most of the ice melted in the glasses!  The sandwiches looked like they were slopped on the plate by a child. To make matters worse, both of us have our heads in the toilet puking from food poisoning!  ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE PLACE!"}
{"text":"Hit or miss? I think so.  Red onions and tomatoes don't belong on potato skins. Onion rings were not cooked long enough. French Dip was good.  Waitress was nice and attentive."}
{"text":"This place is just weak. Absolute inability to take advantage of a monopolized location. Service is generally mediocre at best and I finally gave it one last chance.   Last visit at 5 p.m. happy hour. Order beer. 15 minutes later, finally ask for menu. 30 minutes later, set credit card down. 10 minutes later, she asked if I ever ordered. I laughed and told her it has been 40 minutes. She brought the check and the weakest apology I have ever heard. No attempt to try and resolve on her part. This is the bartender = horrible sign.   Got to listen to 4 employees b.s. around on an empty stomach.   This is an area with disposable income. Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers might hammer that final nail in their coffin.  Competition is increasing in the area, they should at least fake an effort."}
{"text":"I didn't come in expecting anything fantastic because it's just a bar but even for those standard I was (in all honesty) underwhelmed. Wings are baked and not fried, why bother offering them. The waitress brought the wrong style of wings after making the recommendation for said style and then acted like she did us a favor not charging us for the portion we returned (they charged us for the portion they did finally bring). The bbq pork sand wedge was pretty fantastic along with the sweet potato fries. The fish n chips would have been rejected by a McDonald's (huge chunk of cartilage or whatever in each piece) beer selection is made by someone who clearly prefers mixed drinks. Great place if you want to save money on a tip!"}
{"text":"0 stars for this location.$6.99 for a kids shrimp meal that came with 6 shrimp! Freaking rip off! Never got a refill on drinks. The location on University is a million times better. Won't be back here."}
{"text":"great happy hour, service was fine, not sure why it's only 1.5 stars but I'm a fan"}
{"text":"We have been here several times now, and.our experiences have all been fantastic! The service was better than average, and our food has been consistently and surprisingly good! I expected bar food, since it has a sports bar ambience -- and.they DO have plenty of bar food. But for what this place is, and the cost, the food was very tasty and they have some great salads in generous proportions. We live closeby, and have necome regulars."}
{"text":"Fat willys is a great place to go for Sunday football. The manager there has adjusted the tvs to put my favorite team on right in front of me. My family loves it there and can't wait for sundays. I don't know which i like the best, the service, spending time with my family, football, or the food. Actually my two favorites are the food and service. And they definitely have the best burger in town whoop whoop #FatGuysKnow"}
{"text":"Fat Willy's - what a cool place! Beer selection is good and prices are reasonable. Ask for Brooke for the best service ever!"}
{"text":"This place as gone way down hill  since our last visit... We wont be back.  First thing they might try is getting a waitress with a personality, not a snarl on her face for having to work on Saturday morning.  She provided the very very basics, we had to ask for everything else.  As for the food, my daughter in law is still in bed due to he horrible eggs benedict.  All of our meals looked like they had been sitting under the heat lamp waiting for the waitress to serve them way to long.  The ground beef in the omelet looked like it  was cooked days ago and warmed up on the griddle.  Overall, a  disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Great happy hour beer prices and app specials! Killer pizza! Good folks."}
{"text":"What a Dive!!! Owner is obviously in the wrong business, needs to hire a Maid for this place"}
{"text":"The food is ok. Kind standard for a sports bar but it's was fine.  This is a great place to grab a beer and watch a game."}
{"text":"This place was terrible. I found a quarter in my bud light. The tender would not speak English or listen to me. Further more after that the prices are crazy, $47 for a bottle of Bud!"}
{"text":"We were hesitant to go back because of poor service last time but decided to give it another shot. Only this time we had great service, and the food was horrible! It was soggy and drenched in sauce, our waitress noticed we were unhappy and had it remade and it was so soggy again!!!!! We said forget it! Also the man in the button down blue shirt (who I assume was the manger) was eating french fries in the kitchen  while traying up food..gross. Then when we were leaving, him nor the greeter said a word as we were walking out the door .. as where a good restaurant would thank you for your service and tell ya to have a good night or we'll see ya next time or something???? Not just ignore there guests leave"}
{"text":"Went in to check it out for breakfast, still sitting, 45 minutes later waiting for my omelette. That wouldn't be that bad except for the fact that there are only 5 other couples in the restaurant. I feel bad for the wait staff because they are just standing around waiting for the food to be completed. My server has been great."}
{"text":"Nice place. Food was average with no complaints. Good bloody marry bar and bar staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome place!! Great people and friendly atmosphere. We have been here many times and always had a wonderful experience. Bridgett is always smiling and ready to help!! She is a phenomenal bartender and we enjoy coming to see her"}
{"text":"Well let's see..?  You are the only place around that serves Bar Food...and well this was the 5th or 6th time we have have eaten here and as usual they hold the standard for mediocre to bad fried food. Everything at our table was under cooked and some of the wings were almost a health hazard they were so under cooked. If you go to the restroom you can see there fryers smoking away with dirty grease no matter what day of the week you eat here..do they buy used dirty grease...?  There pizza will make you miss lunch room pizza from elementary school. You can go on for days on there short falls...and that's all they have..! But there draft beer is good as long as you get a cold mug.. Water...AWFUL...!!! FOUNTAIN SODA EVEN WORSE.. !!! And there Bacon did you get it at a Dollar Store? As chain you need help and management that knows what they are doing as well...Maybe hire some kitchen staff with culinary experience....!!! If you are anywhere near a Chili's do not even consider Fat Willys.."}
{"text":"Went to try it for the first time with my 2 kids and wife, since it says that its a family restaurant? as i was looking back by where the cooks were, i noticed a middle aged man with glasses yelling the throwing food, he then began to say the \"F\" word 3 times, my kids heard it and asked what is that? i tried to play it off. When the food got to our table i asked, who is that with the glasses on? the owner??? really i said? He said yes. I told him what i heard and he said he would tell the manager. She finally came by and apologized, but she wasn't surprised? like he has done that many times before. I told her you don't need to apologize he does but he never did. he was that upset because the waitress didn't say cheese burger, ordered it as no cheese...... Family restaurant??? Never again will we go their. What an example the owner makes........."}
{"text":"The manager on duty was very rude to me. I got the apple crisp, and it was absolutely disgusting. It was soggy and too sweet, in addition to it being a tiny portion. I told the waitress and the manager that I was unhappy about it, but neither of them did anything to fix it. The manager argued with everything I said, and insinuated that I was just trying to get free food. He even argued with me when I said the food gave me a headache. I come here every week with a large group, but he did nothing to get us to come back. His tone of voice was very demeaning, and he certainly didn't have the \"customer is always right\" mentality. I was very disappointed in the way he treated his customers."}
{"text":"Haven't gotten my food yet and already posting this review. I was met by 4 servers to take my drink order, and am sitting here watching 5 waiters enjoy the football game.... Oh what's that? You want to take my order now?? Awesome! I'll have a..... (That was where I was told to HOLD MY ORDER WHILE TE WAITER WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING WATCHED A PLAY FROM YR FOOTBALL GAME!!!) Yes I was to to hold on a second RIGHT AFTER he told me to give him my order.  I got it man, you're a fan.... If it was that important, take the day off and watch it! This place is terrible. I'll never come back again and I'll probably find somewhere else to go after this first game."}
{"text":"I've been going to the one in Mesa for about 3 years and now I found this one in Gilbert. Ive only been at this lo action for lunch and the have good service. They have good bar food. I've tried a couple of the burgers and a couple of salads and I love the buffalo chicken salad. I would recommend you try this bar-staurant ."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan because the place is close to my house happy hour is seven days a week. and I truly enjoy the service. Bridget, Erica, and  the Jens. you should try the weekend breakfast bloody mary bar!."}
{"text":"The place was packed as it was a Friday night. We were seated quickly but it took about ten minutes to get someone to serve us. Our waitress was nonexistent after taking our orders and our drinks were never refilled. The food took a long time to arrive and wasn't worth the wait. We witnessed another party of 6 or so leave after waiting ten minutes for anyone to acknowledge them and no one even tried to stop them before they left. A disappointing experience, we will not return."}
{"text":"Food quality is OK but it's a sports bar. Service was good. Servers were attentive. Prices were fair."}
{"text":"Food is so so. It's always crowded with perverts looking at your junk, and their husbands just let em. The waitresses look like their straight out of rehab."}
{"text":"Read some previous reviews, especially concerning service, but a group of four of us decided to give it a try. Arrived on a Friday at 4:00 and quickly found a table in the bar area. Our server arrived in a few minutes with a friendly greeting and took our order of drinks. She said just let her know when we were ready to order food. The beer was ice cold in nice frosty mugs! !   She came around just enough to check on us without being over bearing. Ordered some appetizers off the Happy Hour menu and they arrived quickly. Portions were huge and tasty. We're honestly not sure why some reviews were so bad, we have nothing but great things to say about the whole experience. We will definitely be back! !"}
{"text":"Nice to have a local bar where I can stop in on my way home from work, have a cold beer where I feel the comfortable and comfortable"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. Dad told me that the breakfast is rockin'. However when my food came out to me it was cold...I ordered the biscuits and gravy expecting it to be better than what I can make at home. It was so cold that I had a film over the gravy, so when I told my server who was super nice and great, she brought it back to the cook. Now, what you're supposed to do is give the customer an entirely new plate. I was given back the same plate with cold eggs burnt bacon and the same biscuits and gravy with just more hot gravy poured on top, which of course just cooled the new gravy. I would suggest not coming here if you're looking for that meal. And to watch out for cold food that is not properly given back to you.   The two stars they have goes to the service. You guys are the meat and potatoes of this joint and you rock. The cooks...not so much."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended to us by a co-worker, mainly because of their $5.00 burger night and $5 appetizers and happy hour.  We have a special waitress, Carri,  who waited on us our first time and we always request her, however, have experienced other waitstaff and all of them are just as professional.  We have always had great service.  The first time my son and I tried it, we were hooked.  We come almost every Monday for $5 burgers and great appetizers ( fried zucchini is the best ).  My husband used to work out of town but now is in town and we go at least 2 times a week.  We go almost every Monday for burgers and usually Fridays for steak or  pizza or all you can eat fish.  As with any restaurant, we have our favorite foods, but have never been disappointed with anything we have tried.  We love that it is a locally owned establishment and will continue to enjoy their restaurant anytime we can and will also recommend them to our friends and family. They have a bar area, a dining area, and a patio.  Several TVs are available to enjoy different options for games.  The entire staff is friendly and  professional.  We have always experienced excellent service. We love Fat Willy's Chandler Heights."}
{"text":"Went back after not going for a few years because of the last somewhat bad experience we had there.  We ordered the all-you-can-eat fish and chips with extra crispy fries.  What we got was VERY extra crispy fish with tarter sauce that was so thin it dripped off the fish when we dipped the fish in it.  The fries were limp and the coleslaw tasted old and somewhat rotten.  When the waitress came by we asked if the fish is usually this dark.  She said they were going to change the oil, which would take a while, but she would bring more out after the oil was changed.  She came back after speaking with the manager who said they will not be able to change the oil as quickly as they wanted, so they will not charge us for the fish and to choose another meal.  She did bring us two baskets of extra crispy fries.  We each ordered the Philly cheese steak sandwich, which turned out pretty good.  Unfortunately, with these experiences and others that had to do with a dirty bathroom and over-flowed toilet makes me give them a low rating and we will not ever go back."}
{"text":"The don't cook here, they just heat frozen food with a deep frier. Awful awful awful. The staff will argue with you when something doesn't taste good. Steer clear."}
{"text":"OK look this isn't your trendy new spot or your retarded hipster dive bar. It's a sports bar with lots of tvs and happy hour till 7. Apps are only 5 bucks and there's a good selection at that price. Beer glasses are always cold. Well drinks are poured with a strong damn hand. Some of the bar tenders are awesome as hell and some aren't. Who cares! The wings kick ass. I recommend hot finished on the grill not retossed. Trust me order them. There's a jukebox you can control with your phone. On nights the bartenders suck.... I spend 5 bucks and set it to play a bunch of horrible music as I leave. Bottom line..... good food. Clean glasses. Plenty of parking. Good prices. Staff is hit or miss. All in all worth coming back over and over.  Devon and Mike and Katie  kick ass.  If they are at the bar you'll be treated awesome unless you act like a fool. As for the rest of them, who cares everything is priced well!"}
{"text":"Overall experience was very poor. Terrible food and bad customer service from the owner. Not recommended and will never go back."}
{"text":"This afternoon we went to Fat Willy's. The service and food was horrible. Not sure what part of Happy Hour is \"Happy\" or \"Affordable\". Their Southwest Egg Rolls went from $5 to $9.50. Still 6 pieces but mostly cheese and almost double in price. What I would have paid $20 2 months, and now closer to $40. Just ABSOLUTELY Ridiculous. I left half of my Michelada because it was all V8-Clamato. There's always new employees so for the owner to say \"it's the same cooks\", seem hard to believe. I live close and enjoyed it, but won't be returning. Another incident happened on Saturday when my friend was accussed of puking in the mens bathroom, when it was one of thier regulars who had a little too much. How are you going to accuse and then tell the patron, \" if you're going to puke to go outside\"? Um... Why don't you pay attention who you are serving and who did it. No apology or anything. This place was cool to hangout, but after the upgrades, it went to ish."}
{"text":"The food was so bad they kept bringing us more food to compensate but it was just more bad food. I had the all you can eat fish and puked my brains out that night after 1 serving. My gf ordered a pizza and it was not cooked. They kept  bringing us apps but they were not very good. The waitress was the best she tried her hardest but it wasn't her fault. I would never eat there again after getting sick."}
{"text":"Horrible time sauce taste likes water katsup over cook burger burnt chicken tenders soggy fries will not return service from waitress 6.5"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoy going to FatWillys. I am a bit of a tight-wad, so we always go with a coupon. The waitresses are always friendly and the prices are reasonable (even without a coupon). I am not sure why the person in the previous post didn't ask for a different channel or to turn the TV on...they've always been accommodating when we asked for a specific college or nfl game. Last time, the manager asked if we had a preference of dish or direct tv."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. It dirty, the food sucks and the service is terrible. Do not waste your time or money. I came here once before and it had just opened and it was terrible. So I came back 3-5 months later and the food still sucks and now this restaurant is filthy."}
{"text":"Warm beer mugs and over cooked burgers.  How do you over cook a burger???  Service was friendly, cook should be fired!  If you want cold beer in a cold mug, this isn't the place."}
{"text":"The middle of the place is set up with kids' arcade games. Weird. Service was rushed because they have one bartender covering a whole room with tables on the bar side of place. My brunch food arrived with no toast and I had a craft  beer. When I got the bill I was shocked to see $9.50 for a tall draft and $7.95 for a short. WOW! That is vacation beach resort pricing for like...a premium margarita. When I casually asked a manager on the way out. Really? Was this correct pricing? Dont you think that is crazy pricing? He laughed and said..Yeah. I agree. Okay then. I was correct.  Hey, for this weird little dive place, the food is just ok..nothing stellar to go back for and every place has 40 inch TVS for the games. We would rather go elsewhere with better or equal food. Normal pricing for a craft draft beer and no kiddy arcade games in the middle of a restaurant/bar."}
{"text":"Every time we come I hope this place will be better.  The food was so bland, the burger ordered was soggy and had no flavor. This place never gets better and the management is either unaware of issues or careless. Only reason to come would be the beers on draft. East valley is in need of better restaurants asap."}
{"text":"Another one of our local. and regular, hangouts. They have a great happy hour with drink and food specials. There is always a group of us and the servers are pretty attentive and on knowledgeable. Also highly impressed with management. Sure we've had minor food or service issues but all have been promptly addressed and rectifies by management. Though they don't always take reservations, they are very accommodating with groups! I love that! It puzzles me sometimes when you call an establishment and tell them you'd like to bring a group of your friends and they won't hold a table or add you to the wait list. Fat Willy's wants your business!  Staff... Hmm.. The host/hostesses are friendly, accommodating and seat you promptly. Angie and Mark in the bar are phenomenal. Once you're a regular, they'll remember your drink and greet you by name! There is always a rotating bunch of wait staff in the restaurant area and we rarely have any problems - even with our finicky customized orders.  Though the menu is vast, it is more of a bar-food selection. We typically order the Buffalo Chicken Salad with grilled chicken, delicious! Another favorite is the adult Chicken (grilled) with Mac & Cheese, outstanding! And don't forget the kid's steak. Yes!! A kid's steak! Cooked to order and served with a side. A great value and keeps the kids happy!  I didn't want to ding them on a high rating, but the two items I would like to see improvement on would be 1) Please add some healthier alternatives (more salad variations, non-fried fish, humus, veggie tray, etc.) and 2) Please instruct wait staff that if your table is playing Live Trivia, when the host is speaking is not the time to ask the table for the order.. Minor issues and the atmosphere and overall staff attitude make this an ideal casual place to come to.  And for those looking for an alternative place to catch a game there are lots of TVs in the bar and restaurant area. A decent beer selection (they could ask for my recommendation on one or two to add ;) and usual specials."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! We took our family (4 kids ranging in age from 10 months to 7 years) and the atmosphere and service was superb! Our server was amazing and went above and beyond and really created that exceptional experience. We will definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"Daily happy hour until 7pm! Was totally craving a GOOD burger, & the CA burger totally hit the spot! Guacamole, pepperjack cheese, yummy goodness. Got the dmall plate happy hour Carne Asada fries. The Pico made them. The 1/2 Cobb salad looks super good, but too full to try it."}
{"text":"Great sports bar for watching games!  Their wings are AWESOME, I like them grilled.  Mmmmmm. The people are friendly and it's generally not crowded. Bar tenders are attentive and nice."}
{"text":"We have been to the other fat Willys on crimson and have had a great experience, however this location was unacceptable! The spinach dip was just spinach in a dip dish() that took 20+ min to get to us. Okay service but plenty of other great places to compare!!"}
{"text":"11 years coming to this location. Used to be a breakfast place called Sunny Side Up. Fat Willeys moved in about 8 years ago. They started strong but had a 4 year slump before investing in the future. Now it is a great venue. Food is fair and pricing is great at Happy Hour. I'll keep going"}
{"text":"Eh, this spot is ok. Our server was very nice, resourceful and quick. There was a lingering smell inside the restaurant though that wasn't very appetizing. I ordered the chicken strips & we got the nachos appetizer. Both were ok! Very typical sports bar interior, nice patio!"}
{"text":"We live close to here and like to come for happy hour from time to time. It's your typical sports bar but the food is decent and the drink specials are good. If you're looking for a good happy hour spot with a sports bar feel then this is a nice place."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I went over to get some food and drinks. I was going to be the designated driver so I stopped and got some coffee and headed over. The POS bartender told me I couldn't bring it in! Really? Wanted me to get rid of it so I had to slam down my 32oz hot coffee before I could come in! I ordered the Fish and Chips. The fish was so greasy that it took 2 napkins just to get some of it out. Fries we just mediocre and the coleslaw was sitting in what looked like watered down mayo! You would have to use a spoon to eat it. All the food my co-workers ordered wasn't up to par either. I will NEVER step foot in this place again!!"}
{"text":"Friendly Service but food is not so good. Had the California Omelet had way to much bacon and they skipped the avocado."}
{"text":"Beware.    St. Paty's Day-tap beer $6.25- never paid that much for a 160z tap beer Wow!  Food okay - but beer prices unreal!"}
{"text":"Decent... ok food. Good atmosphere. Long wait when you're at the table if you're there for a game. Otherwise...just an average sports bar with average character and nothing special that really sets them apart."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here on a Tuesday for happy hour on a whim. We are new to the area and the parking lot always seems to be packed so we decided to give it a shot. We sat at the bar and had great bar tenders. The happy hour drink and appetizer prices were great. We ordered Nachos and wings. The wings were great. I don't recommend the nachos, unless you are a fan of cheese whiz. I personally am not.   The ambience is decent. Just your average regular neighborhood sports bar. Looked like a good place to watch a game!"}
{"text":"Service is terrible. Rude staff. Hey bartender, maybe check the patio once in awhile?"}
{"text":"Best food, best staff, best environment! Come here to watch sports - TV's on TV's and beer!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a couple of months now and really like the atmosphere, plenty of TVs for sports, nice patio with misters and family always welcome. I watched the NBA playoffs here to route for the Celtics come to find out of of the cute bar tenders was from Boston so that made it even better destination LOL. I recommend their pizza, sounds plain as they have a great menu but I was told they make their own dough and I can tell, outstanding. Another item I really liked was the Apple Crisp desert with vanilla ice cream, out of this world!!!! Fat's has become my favorite local sports bar. Also was able to park my Harley near a window so I could easliy keep an eye out, another thing I really liked was their WIFI was free and worked really well, thanks Fats"}
{"text":"I have to admit we were on our way somewhere else when we saw this place.  We've actually seen it several times just never stopped, but today we did and my wife and myself were pleasantly surprised.  We started off with the pretzel bites.  They were delicious.   Hot, soft, salty and the cheese dip you get with them is awesome.  I had the mango habenaro grilled wings.  Some of the best I have had.  My wife had the quesdilla burger.  It was also very good.  We split the onion rings.  Those were also great.  Service was spot on.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was nice, helpful and on top of things.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Omg this is the worst place ever. We were seated and waited 20 minutes for a server. No joke. Our server blamed the other girl and got us drinks. The other girl came by to say sorry and the manager said we can get an app on them. We got our food and the server asked if she could get me another beer. I said sure. 20 minutes later we were done eating and she said ohhhh u ordered another beer. I said just bring the check. She brought the check and never returned to collect payment. My boyfriend finally got up and ask someone to cash us out. The app was never taken off however that was the least of out worries. Bummed that the sucked. We live in the neighbor hood and will not be back. Poor management and service."}
{"text":"My local place for Saturday mornings for breakfast and Sunday mornings for Breakfast, Bloody Mary Bar (they have everything) and football-lots of TV's. Then you have world class service in the bar. Bridget, Erica, JB and Jen are on top of it. You visit twice and they remember your name and your drink. Food is good, but I go for the service."}
{"text":"I don't know about the other reviewers, but the service I had was less than stellar, time to get our drinks and food were long, the menu had too many items on it, the food was less than spectacular, and the decor had not changed at all since it was Red, White, and Brew.  I'm surprised there were as many people that there were there.  Maybe it's just because they opened and are still ironing out the wrinkles, but it will be sometime before I visit again."}
{"text":"I love the bar countertop! The food is good. People get rowdy when watching games. Not sure what else to say. Ha!"}
{"text":"We found a BOGO coupon in the Saguaro Gold coupon mag and decided to try this place out Sunday morning about 10:30 am. The country-fried steak and eggs breakfast was decent for the price. The service was friendly but very slow due to the fact that there was only one server to take care of the entire restaurant and bar. I would go back if I found another coupon."}
{"text":"This place isn't what it used to be. The service is absolutely terrible!! You have to almost beg to get refills, and it took 30 minutes to bring my salad. The waitresses need to learn how to serve all their tables and not just the ones they want to. There is one waitress who is the rudest I have ever seen. She doesn't smile and doesn't even get your order right and gives you an attitude when you ask her to fix it. The manager is no better. I don't think he had ever managed a restaurant before."}
{"text":"Not impressed anymore. We came here so often and it was fine but the service and food have gone down hill. Some of the waitresses are good and most are horrible. They don't  check if your food is ok, refill your drinks. The managers are just as bad. They never come around to greet guests, it's all about themselves not caring who is in the restaurant. Won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Came her for a family dinner so I didn't have to cook. Boy, what a bad decision that was. Had the chicken Marsala which was served in an iron skillet? Who does that? The Marsala sauce was a coagulated mess of flour and grease, chicken was fatty and awful. My sisters pasta was cold and undercooked. This place might be okay for the bar crowd, but family restaurant this is NOT."}
{"text":"Went there to meet people for Friday Happy Hour.  Service was horrible.  They ran out of mugs for the beer specials during Happy Hour.  A bar that has been open this long should know how many mugs they need for a Friday night Happy Hour.  AND it took forever between ordering and getting it to the table. All they kept saying is \"sorry - we are out of mugs!\"   Food was OK but because of the service and LACK OF mugs to pour beer (IN A BAR), we will stay away from this place.  Maybe on a slow weekday afternoon it would be better."}
{"text":"When we go out to dine we expect comfort, good service, and ambience.  Sadly Fat Willies has NONE of these.  It was well over 80 degrees at the bar.  Waitress was slow and had an attitude.  Hot does NOT equal ambience. Our suggestion :  stay away!"}
{"text":"My family have been regulars at FW for at least 5 years.  At this point after an experience on Friday, we will be hard pressed to return. There are many great people who work there, Mike,  Angelica, Irene , Erica, Jordan...... We are extremely sad the hear that Mike is going to another store.  As a manager he is WONDERFUL!!!! He works hard to have a great  relation with staff and customers. We said all along he sound be the GM.  My main complaint is regarding Angie and lack of professionalism in her job.  She's rude in taking care of the customer.  Case in point. We were on there around 9:00 on Friday night. She brought a few drinks to us, that was it. When we decided get some apps another waitress put in the order . This in turn upset Angie and she then decided to turn us over to another server. To us this was a unprofessional decision.  She also brings her personnel life into the bar.  We have witnessed on various occasions her arguing with her Husband/ boyfriend.  FW is a great neighborhood bar, but there are others around in which we can go ."}
{"text":"Great food and drink options.  My favorite is their wings.  They have a great selections of sauces and rubs.  This is a great place to bring the family or stop in for a beer.  It is not fancy but extremely friendly.  Michael is one of their standout servers.   He always greets us with a smile and a wave.  The food is always hot and the beer is always cold."}
{"text":"We just absolutely love having Fat Willy's in the neighborhood. The staff is always friendly and they have a huge vareity of food on the menu. I am a big fan of the South West eggo rolls. We especially enjoy all of the different events that they have. Yesterday was Nick & Wes dueling pianos www.azduelingpianos.com We took about 10 friends with us and it was jusr pure fun. Great music, good food and everyone was happy. It is a very casual comfortable enviroment and best of all it is close to home"}
{"text":"Best onion rings I've had in a long time! My Asian wrap (sans green peppers) was light and yummy...really good fries, and my husband enjoyed the Rueben! We walked in by chance, hoping to catch a college football game and have a cold beer. The Four Peaks Pumpkin Porter was ice cold and it was so nice to watch the games without the volume being up so loud you have to scream. Service was friendly and attentive - great time, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"The good news is that they have Happy Hour every day and the apps are 5 bucks each. The bad news is that the apps we ordered were not that good. The potato skins had pico de gallo on them (yes she asked if we wanted it) and were undercooked a bit. The pretzel bites left a bunch to be desired and neither was worthy of the full menu price. The bar does not feature one football team and the TV sets at the bar were pretty good, but it depends on what seat is available. It seems like a decent locals joint to watch sports and they have some good beer specials each day. On Sunday it was $4 large drafts and the place was not packed like most bars on Sunday."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about the bartenders here. Ryan, Erika, Bridgette. They are the number one reason we come here often.  Oh and the meatloaf dinner is really good."}
{"text":"We ordered take out. I had the country fried steak with sausage gravy. It was yummmy."}
{"text":"Food was OK and the prices you cant beat. But the service is HORRIBLE! They are nice but supper slow and very forgetful. It almost feels that you are bothering them if you ask for anything. You would think by being a new business they would bring in staff that has some get up in their step. I tried to rate this higher because this place is by my house and I'm trying to support it but just cant.   Sorry   Wish you had better service."}
{"text":"Burger was good, but the service is AWFUL!!!! We sat down on Memorial Day (Monday) and waited 1:00 for 3 burgers and a kids meal.  Really!!!!!????!!!!  The AC was blaring, the wait staff seemed embarrassed by the delay, and we were told we were going to get taken care of for our trouble (we really didn't complain a lot about the lousy service at the time).  Our waiter graciously (sarcastically) took of 10% of a whopping 25$ bill...Wow, if I made $2.50 an hour it might of been worth my wait, fortunately I don't.  Avoid until they get their stuff straightened out, the food actually was not bad."}
{"text":"Do not come here ! The $1 pint beer offer will not be recognized, the bartender is rude and the ambience is awful. Don't waste your time - better places that appreciate your business around the corner..."}
{"text":"Monday night: I thought when I walked in I was at Chucky Cheese or something.  There was a table of about 15 kids 8yo and younger sitting unsupervised. The parents were at another table and were ignoring the kids. They were running around, screaming like at the  playground. Still no responds from the neglectful parents. 2 men from other tables were getting mad and asked for the manager.  This is where one star is earned: the manager came over and spoke to the one guy and it was clear the manager wasn't going to control the situation. The customer left and said he'd never be back. I gave him a signal I agreed with him which he pointed out to the manager. Still no response from the manager. The rowdy Yates of children continued their bad behavior. Here's the kicker they ordered pizza, why not go to PPP, this noise level is acceptable there. And not to mention at FW on Wednesday kids eat free. So on Wednesday it would be unreasonable to expect a lower noise level. But on Monday? Bad on the managers part to not compensate for the 15 screaming kids. I had to cover my ears! I won't be back. Bad management behavior. And the manager dropped our food to the table and said nothing at all. No apologies or hey come back here's a coupon. Nothing I love kids just don't enjoy misbehaving brats."}
{"text":"Love trivia night and the atmosphere!  Comfortable seating and reasonable prices!  Fun place to relax!"}
{"text":"Leroy Sinclair and his band were great to hear.  Always a good time when he's entertaining!  Mardi Gras was disappointing along with the service.  They should have been prepared for this special day.  I didn't see any beads distributed to the customers.  :-("}
{"text":"We attended the Hoe Down at Fat Willey's Saturday evening in Sunland Village East and all I can say is that the food service was very poor.  Even though we bought tickets ahead of time and chose the entrees ahead of time the food didn't come out in a timely manner.  We sat at a table of six and my husband and I got our food at least an hour before the other four people sitting with us.  The restaurant knew ahead of time how many people were attending and yet they basically had two servers who were actually trying to take care of the drinks and getting the food outside.   One bartender was on duty and one young girl trying to check people in for their meal.  If you want to have these sort of functions then you need to have proper staffing and a better system for serving food.  I can only imagine what the service will be when the winter snowbirds return.  Let's get it together Fat Willey's"}
{"text":"It's a great little bar and grill that has a variety of entertainment options through the week including trivia and karaoke. Happy hour runs until 7 PM and it is totally worth the price. If you like to watch sports this is a good place to go because there are several TVs throughout the building."}
{"text":"Great grilled wings (mango habanero) and cheap drinks all day, every day! Each day has a different deal but they are all good."}
{"text":"Revisited with the coupon they gave us for a free entree because they hosed up my burger on the last visit.   If you can believe it, I ordered the exact same burger and they hosed it up again. Why does the waitress ask how I want it cooked?  Medium rare does not mean well done. Why bother to ask?  This place is good for pouring cheap beer. That's it. The food is terrible.  A sports bar that can't cook a burger correctly isn't worth visiting.  The manager never bothered to visit our table to explain why they suck at burgers.  Flat out terrible.   We had the additional benefit of the gym rats next door jumping on us for a gym membership on the way in and on the way out. Don't worry, sweat freaks.  If this place keeps screwing up my burgers, I won't need a gym membership. I left hungry.  Fat Willys blows."}
{"text":"We've had great burgers here along with good service and judging from how busy they usually are, plenty of folks must like them too!"}
{"text":"I live close to this place and I had been anxiously waiting to find my good neighborhood \"go to spot\". This is definitely the place!  A great staff and excellent food choices and not to mention great beer.  It's always good to catch the games on Sunday or just take the wife out for one of their fabulous Coron-Rita, which are very tasty.  Hope this places keeps up the good work with their Sunday breakfast options, spicy bloody Mary's and their good local brew selections.  God job guys.  ps....one thing we did find to be bland in flavor were the Fajitas. But, definitely something they can fix! ;)"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for appetizers and drinks on a Friday night. Service was poor, food had little to no taste and the drinks tasted watered down, I had a mule and my wife a bloody Mary.Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Went in was greeted right away, told the waiter I wanted an order to go looked at the menu decided what I wanted, put the menu down to indicate I was ready to order. It was a full 10 minutes before a different waitress came up to me and asked me what I needed. I explained that I changed my.mind I was gonna eat in. I put in my order another full 10 minutes went by and finally got my food. My order was an appetizer. I told the waitress that was all for now, and then every 2 minutes asked me if was done. I did not feel I was welcome. There were at leass 7 waitresses, and the place isn't that big and they were all just standing around. It seems like a place for regulars and if your not a regular they don't give a crap. Would not recommend it."}
{"text":"The menu is great (for a bar) but the staff and organization is a bit to be desired.  When I say staff, I mean the service.  They aren't exactly on top of their game at Fat Willys. I went for Cinco de Mayo and it was painfully obvious they didn't have the event planned out well.  The only thing thing that made up for it was the server outside who made the best margarita I'd ever had!  Overall, it's ok if your looking for a neighborhood bar and don't mind having to flag down your server."}
{"text":"This place was ehhhh at best. Gave the 2 stars based solely on the food. Came in for a coronita but place was short staffed. Only 1 bartender and 1 waitress on a Saturday night. Bartender said he had no limes, started the margarita and couldn't finish it. Luckily gave it to me at no cost. Then tried to use the yelp $1 pint. He said we couldn't use it and it wasn't valid even though we ordered an entree. Food was the best part. Was def delicious. If it had been bad this place would have gotten negative stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Done with this place.   Tried multiple times to like this bar.   Got stuck with 2 other people's tab.  Very rude waitress, and not to smart to get this figured out. Prices getting worse for crap food. Horrible smell at the bar that does not get any better.    Way better experience at the bar 2.8 miles west of this.  Cleaner establishment.  Nicer staff, and more intelligent management."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in where this neighborhood sports bar has gone. Used to go a few times a month. Went for my birthday dinner with family. After waiting for 30 mins for a table they seated us outside on patio. Took forever to get a waitress to help. Had to go to bar to get my beers after 15 min wait. Food finally came 45 mins later and mine was cold and wrong. Couldn't complain cause the next time we saw anyone was when our bill came. No refills on drinks nobody came to check on us. Horrible CS. Went to website to send emails to someone??? Well after three unanswered messages I just gave up. Went back for my sons birthday dinner and little to no improvement. Have not been back. Get back to when you were a small family friendly place to eat. Good food at a decent price and I may give you a try again. Quit trying to be a fine dining place and go back to the way you started out."}
{"text":"Went there for trivia night last Wednesday and it wasn't very busy and it was still happy hour.  I ordered the wings and asked for them crispy - I dont think the cook in the back knew what that meant because they werent - and they were very greasy. I dont know how you can mess up wings but they were eh.  Our server was trying hard but everyone had to ask for refills, not exactly on top of his game. Not impressed with this place at all."}
{"text":"My husband and I have tried to like this place three different times. Each time we are extremely disappointed and say we are never going back. We keep hoping the service has improved and the food goes beyond mediocre. Each time we have tried it, nothing but the staff has changed. I'm not sure if it's a lack of training of the servers or just indifference. My opinion only but I think what keeps the doors open is that there aren't many sports bars in the area so there's a captive audience. However, I would rather drive some distance than go for a fourth disappointment.   Today, we went for breakfast. Our order was wrong and we never saw our server again after our food came out so we couldn't have him fix it. We never received refills on our water. And to top it off, there were no seat covers in the restroom.   We won't be back."}
{"text":"Friends in the Sunland neighborhood suggested we go down to the golf course club house and eat at Fat Willy's. They said the food is very good.  Food is good but not great. It's American style diner food. Not a lot of options, per se, but they do have some healthy lite menu items as well. I would liken them to a Village Inn with a limited menu. They have a couple of TVs in the restaurant bar area so folks can watch golf and other sports.  I will give them props because the service was fantastic."}
{"text":"I don't have a ton to say about this place but I gave it 3 stars because the food is an awful 1 star but the bar and bartenders are 5 star so it evens out. One of my favorite places to drink with friends on a Sunday morning while I watch people work out next door"}
{"text":"I have always been greeted with a smile and if I didn't know the server an introduction is always offered. Friendly service and great prices. Lots of TV sets and a great place to watch the game, any game, just ask. Food quality can vary but in my opinion it's on part with the competition in the area, I have never  left dissatisfied and the staff strives to keep it that way. I think this is a great pub for many reasons, too many of us have unreasonable expectations as every experience must exceed the last. This is a real sports grill with real people making it work and a friendly place to spend some time. A local favorite."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go and get wings, beer, and watch a game if you get a great seat next to the video wall. Good news is that this place does not get that packed so you are bounds to have a great view of the TVs on Sunday. I love eating wings here since you can add $0.50 cents and get nothing but wings or drums put on your order. Yelp has a coupon on here for a $1.00 draft beer on here to get you started. Hit up this place just once and fall in love with the great wings :)"}
{"text":"I don't think I have ever been to a  bar where I have felt like a burden on the bartenders like I did in this place. Started out sitting at the bar having to ask for a drink. Female barbacktender looked at me like something was rolling around in her skull but thoughts were not quite connecting. Was obvious when I got here 7:30ish pm on a Sat that the cleanup to go home was already in full swing and the MAIN FOCUS for the evening. I had to ask for a menu, drink #1and#2 before my food was even rung in, which I had to request. Male barbacktender thinks he's actually the bag of chips, but he's probably the worst that I have ever seen. He's actually a barback that should be demoted to dishwasher since he is only relying on the soap sudds to complete him. U Bear is a much better choice if you want actual service. I will give them one star because all the glasses are clean. Probably because their isn't anyone trying to fill them. 12am last call 20ish people here still. Staff must be heading to U Bear. Wow..good times!"}
{"text":"Ok so I go here a lot! But I'm done. I ordered food at 9, received at 953. This happens every time I go. Ryan is good about apologizing but I'm done, sick of it. I live in Augusta ranch and it's sad I can't come here anymore. Literally, every time I order food it takes one hour to receive. Mangers don't care. In fact....a manger is here now drinking. Sucks...cause I like this place but tonight was my last night. A lot of people post bad reviews but I actually like this place. Love football here and everything. If you're just drinking it's fine but for family outings and food is awful."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today it was the most awkward uncomfortable lunch I have had I walk in sat at the bar the ??? Owner gave me a cold hello and walked back into the kitchen then I sat there for 4/5 minutes when the waitperson showed up gave me a fairly friendly hello although the service deteriorated from there ????? I showered brushed my teeth comb my hair  i ordered the wings and asked if I could split the flavors she said it must be 50/50 ok I can deal with that .......she came back out to inform me they had NO WINGS AT ALL...........serious.....so I ordered there 5 dollar burger and asked for it medium and got it basically well done I'm not even sure it was the burg I ordered but I really just wanted to eat and leave at this point she never asked me how any thing was and when she took my check for 18 dollars with a 20 dollar bill she brought me my change and never said a thing .....like thank you or thanks for coming in or ...........ok here's one thing they had a good selection of beer on tap ...... Fat Willy's you are off my list of places to go"}
{"text":"We waited too long for our food. The burger was preformed probably from costco and frozen , the french fries were raw. I ordered beer and they ran out,the next draft beer was stale. Our pizza was under cooked and greasy. 3 rd time I tried this place and it sucked all three times This place sucks. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"We really liked going to this bar for breakfast for a really long time. We had been there for dinner but when our order came out (wrong, the only thing right was the drinks) we told our server that there were mushrooms on the pizza and his response to us was \"What's the matter? Are you allergic?\" and we never saw him the remainder of the evening. Thinking that was just a one-time fluke and we would never see this guy again, we continued to go for breakfast on Saturday mornings until that same person started bartending on Saturday mornings. Today we went and since they were short staffed we decided to go somewhere else (which was okay, we would have come back next week) but the bartender yelled out from the bar as we left \"Go to Good Egg! We sell alcohol here.\" I'm sure this guy must be an owner because no one in their right mind would have him representing their business. I am sad to not go there anymore because we really liked the waitresses but that kind of treatment is not appreciated."}
{"text":"Live in the neighborhood and FW's use to be a go to spot for lunch or football. Last few times food has been pretty gross. Today was it. Ordered some Spinach dip and it was literally cold, chunky (not in a good way) and tasted like crap..even beyond the fact it was cold. How do you screw up a simple appetizer?"}
{"text":"Stopped tonight for a burger - the staff was great. We got there during Happy Hour do we ordered a few appetizers & meals - food was great & very generous portions. Great value."}
{"text":"This bar doesn't even deserve one star. Worst bar experience ever. I went for a birthday party. They were out of sprite, almost every alcohol we asked for and apparently staff. They had one bartender/server for the entire bar on a Saturday night. We had to wait forever to get drinks and the selection was terrible. I was ready to leave fairly quickly but it took 15 minutes to get the bartender to print my tab.  When I finally got it, they had charged me $40 over what I actually ordered, clearing that up wasted even more time and then I spent over 45 minutes trying to pay it at which point one of the bartenders crumpled it up and said not to worry about it, so I left. I found out later they harassed other people to pay for the tab they had crumpled up and threw away. I will never go back here. Worst service and drinks ever."}
{"text":"Local spot very friendly staff and allot of tv's. i never saw fat willy but i will look for him next time i am there come december. no specials otherwise would been 5 stars food on other hand was amazballs. it would help if they play sound of football games though there was no music or anything only noise was noise me and my drunk family provided."}
{"text":"Chicken came out stale, food took too long, and the service was slow. Our waitress didn't tend to our needs, never came to check up on us for refills etc. the garlic knots were literally burnt.   Our wings were harder than a rock, the potato salad was horrible and tasted just wrong.   They had a band who did nothing but sing one song, then proceeded to take a 10 minute break, sang another song, then took another 10 minute break, etc.  The Band is better than the Food!  Do not come here, never again! Horrendous prices for what you get as well. If they probably lowered the prices, then maybe the food would be.....passable."}
{"text":"My 3rd time eating here, burger was good, as were the onion rings. Beer selection is unimpressive, and severely overpriced. My main complaint is the amount of kids running loose in this place. I came to a sports bar to enjoy adult time. Maybe confine the kids to the restaurant side, not on the patio and bar unsupervised. Overall experience = meh"}
{"text":"WE frequent here quite a bit, great place for the family or to watch a game.  Salads are pretty good and they have nice specials throughout the week."}
{"text":"Stopped by simply out of curiosity on a Sat. night and were pleasantly surprised. First our waiter Michael was awesome!  Gave lots of info. on deals and suggestions on what to try.  And it was Karaoke night which was interesting to say the least. We had the fish tacos and a burger with cole slaw.  Everything was very good.  (Fish tacos have a bit of a kick in the sauce that's on the side).   Mon. $6 will be a definite bargain as the burgers are huge!  Thick, large with lots of choices.  We will be back for this one!. All in all, will definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"My first time down here at this establishment I was greeted very welcome, however the bartender or server Chris is absolutely fantastic he made my drinks exactly how I wanted them, however I am picky so he really accomplished my goals easily and when the food showed up oh my God I need the napkin not for the food that was falling on my face but it was from all the saliva from it being so good,  Highly recommended!!!' Thanks Chris"}
{"text":"Service has always been hit an miss. The seating has always been uncomfortable. The food has always been good but their menu recently changed. Some of my menu favorites disappeared, some of my happy hour specials disappeared and the daily specials are more restrictive. At times I also go to the University location and prefer it. I am starting to drive further for the better location (University.)"}
{"text":"FREAKIN LOVE THIS PLACE. $5 burgers on Mondays. Bomb breakfast skillets. Good happy hour prices. And very friendly staff. Place looks a little dirty but all the food I've ordered is tasty. Their southwestern egg rolls taste fresh. Pretzel bites are soft and wings are tasty. The \"bruschetta\" is kind of a joke though. It's just super buttered slice of white bread with tomatoes on it. But the rest of the appetizers are good.  They have amazing Pizza however.   Place is small and gets crowded at times. But they have fun events including trivia and karaoke on certain days.  And plenty of TV's to watch the game too.  And the hidden treat, they have really good desserts. Soft hot brownies and these little fried rolls with ice cream and caramel."}
{"text":"Nachos get a 2/10. They were too greasy and guacamole was brown; we didn't even want to finish them. I enjoyed their TV set up though for watching games. I'd return for future games, but would think twice about what food I order. They are open early on weekends and even serve breakfast!"}
{"text":"This place could be decent if the service was better. I mean it's a sports bar so I am not expecting gourmet food. However our server, Taylor, was just ... ambivalent. She was inattentive and let our food sit under the lamp for long enough so that the wings were cold. She took forever to take care of the bill and we enlisted the help of another server for 2 separate issues.  Not sure if we will go back."}
{"text":"A good place to go for cold beer and decent food.  Service has always been quick and friendly whether sitting at the bar or at a table.  Good selection but my favorite appetizer are their egg rolls."}
{"text":"AWFUL!!!!   Dirty patio, messing looking wait staff. One of the server actually had her boyfriend stop by with her dog and she spent 10 minute petting it and letting it jump all over her and then went back to serving!????? Would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This was not the best place to have lunch, especially with so many other choices around you would think they would vamp it up but nope. This place was a joke. After our food was delivered i asked for ketshup. Keep in mind we had 2 burgers and fries. The waitress comes back with one  little container of ketchup. Seriously??? The burgers were overdone and the ice tea with raspberry and strawberries were something to be desired. I will NEVER go back there. Oh and get this, 35 dollars for 2 burgers 2 strawberry/raspberry iced teas. Totally NOT worth it."}
{"text":"Had lunch. First time. The service was Ok but slow. The atmosphere was fine. The food selection was good. Now we get to the major concern. Ordered burger medium rare, came out well done. Fries crispy, came out regular. We ordered rub wings, absolutely not taste at all.  I am not one to return food but I am one not to return. Bummer as I was hoping for more."}
{"text":"I love this place. Best sports bar in Mesa. The service was awesome and the the wait staff is very attentive.  The Reuben is one of the best I have had and the onion rings are heavenly!!"}
{"text":"Food is average - nothing great but nothing horrible either.  We ordered as \"take out\" and had chicken tenders and shrimp.  Typical bar food quality - frozen and deep fried.  If you are looking for a local place to either go to or pick up food to take home, it will suffice."}
{"text":"We end up eating here often as it's close to home. We often get the pretzel twists which are huge and we often have leftovers because we want to actually eat our meal.   The $5 burger Mondays is great especially when you have kids who want one. I have had several of the salads and they're very good.   Unfortunately, the only thing I did try to eat one time, was the fish and chips and it was not good at all. Everything else I've tried so far including the meatloaf was done pretty well."}
{"text":"Let me start out with I will give them another chance, because the hamburger was amazing and so were the pretzel bites.  Thought service was a little slow and inattentive but in all honestly, I had had such a long day I didn't really care.  For that reason I couldn't give them a 4 or 5 star.  Pretzel bites were soft and pillow like. The cheese sauce had a nice kick. Ordered the Mushroom Swiss Burger and added carmelized onions, soooo good.   Onion Rings were good, but next time I would try another side.    Large beer selection.  Server was nice, just not around much.  Did thank me for my business and told me to come back on Monday and try the $5 burger special.    Definitely worth a try. Several people were talking about happy hour.  It is loud, but it is a bar."}
{"text":"love the beer options. breakfast burger is amazing.  yep and get your. $1 beer good service always"}
{"text":"I was on vacation in Arizona and stopped in.  It was alright...great service though."}
{"text":"The food isn't bad, or good. Same with the atmosphere. It's a shame because I would love to have a favorite hangout close to home. Fat Willy's has potential but needs to do something to create a \"wow factor\"."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and really wanted a place we could hang and drink and stumble home. The three times we were here, servers/bartenders had no personality and service is mediocre. Last time we visited was on NFL first Sunday game and bartender had ZERO personality. We at least expected a smile, or \"hello, how are you\" but got nothing! We assumed one had to be a local and tried to talk to the bartender and again she was so abrupt to do other things than build a server-customer relation. We would have mentioned to the bar manager the disappointing service but he was too busy drinking and being obnoxious. Not worth the time or money to return. Would rather take our business and money to another place and Uber it back. Don't waste money here unless you enjoy crappy service and being ignored by service staff! Future \"Bar Rescue\" site???"}
{"text":"Great food, especially love the breakfast on the weekends.....southwest omelet is the best omelet I have ever had."}
{"text":"The service was horrible- had to order some items twice. Server was rude and would not look directly at anyone. It wasn't until the bill was ready to paid- the she engaged in some conversation and it was so random. The server at the end...says, \"How was the dip?\" We al loosened at her with confusion since we didn't think she knew how to talk to customers! Food was ok. Overall would NOT recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place to go for Happy Hour! The staff is friendly and the appetizers are great! They recently expanded the space, and they have a great patio!"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to come on a $5 Monday for lunch, got the firecracker burger and it was really nice.  The fries were nice and crispy and the brew was ice cold.  Service was good and if I'm ever in the area again (which is rare) on a Monday I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Bartenders worked their tails off !!   Appetizers r fast, hot & good.   I'll come back !!"}
{"text":"Bridget is amazing! She has taken care of us like a champ!  Will be coming here for the Bears game all season!!"}
{"text":"Echo what all the other reviewers say: food is great, atmosphere and location are perfect, very family/kid friendly but the service is incredibly slow! On weekends I always see a bunch of people waiting to get a table and maybe if they weren't so slow people wouldn't have to wait 25 minutes for a table."}
{"text":"Visited Fat Willy's for my first time for lunch. There was a good crowd for a Monday, and I was pumped for the $5 burger special! There are quite a few options for burgers, which is a great deal for $5. You do have to purchase a beverage, but even with that, it's a pretty cheap lunch. You should not expect a super quick lunch if you go in during burger Monday."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good food. When I went the service at the bar was ok, but my real gripe  is the fact that someone can be fired there for a simple mistake and a comment left here on yelp. So by all means go for ok food, but there's better places around the area of Chandler that also treats their staff like decent people."}
{"text":"Kind of a dive, however the prices are good and its great for families.  They mainly have sandwiches and I would put it one notch below Zipps and two notches below Blue 32.  That being said, the deals are tough to beat.  As far as a sportsbar the televisions and ambiance could use some work, but as a local and affordable family restaurant three and a half stars is about right."}
{"text":"We were a little disappointed coming into our local watering hole this evening. My husband and I brought our two children there for a quick Friday night meal. We both ordered two beers, an appetizer, and our meals. However when we got our bill we were shocked at the stadium priced beers. The server was really nice and that's why I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1, but with those prices I don't think we can afford to come back."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times & must say we really enjoy this place.  Good food, beer & of course excellent service.  Wish we could take you back with us to California. Almost forgot the best thing on the menu is Taylor Ham Pork Roll.  Yes, a Jersey thing, and I am a Jersey Girl."}
{"text":"The service and drinks were great. I ordered a small order of the Philly cheesesteak rolls and they came out Burt more than Afghanistan after the MOAB was dropped. They offered to remake, but I don't go there. Too bad the one on the outside of the blast zone was damn tasty. Los Favritos is next door."}
{"text":"Ewwwe! My first and only online review.. We could have walked to the Bashas in the same parking lot and gotten better food from the freezer section! My chicken was raw, Cajun Chicken Pasta? Nope!!  watery Alfredo with a very light seasoning.. Supposed to be Cajun.. Ugh uhhhhh  :( my husbands burger was bloody and the fries cold and mediocre to say the least .. Wanted this place to rock.. Another epic fail! This is the 3rd place in this spot.. Won't be here long. Our service... Terrible ! Our server wouldn't even make eye contact because she knows this place SUCKS! So disappointed .. Attaching some pics ( our jalape√±o poppers .. We're red peppers? Again.. Ew."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Waitress  greeted us by saying \"so, what do you want?\"  I then tried to order from the kids menu which I have done for the past 3 years and her response was \"you can't do that\". I asked why and said I have been doing that for years but she just said no so we got up and walked out. Will never be back that is for sure. Too many choices of restraunts to deal with this type of service."}
{"text":"This place was good a few years back. It has since lost it's taste and atmosphere. Still pretty good if you're looking to have a casual drink but in terms of food, not so much. I used to come all the time for happy hour and order off that section of the menu, but the chicken wings have gone down in quality and no longer hold the same taste. The same can be said about the quesadilla and burgers. The $5 burgers should be $5 as they are not of good quality anymore. I've seen the employees walk in with groceries from the nearby Bashas store and it disappoints me. But then again, we all run out at some point right? My last time there, our waiter took forever to deliver our ice cream dessert. Not good."}
{"text":"Went in here looking for a burger and fries to get right back on the road. But they messed up our food, over cooked the burgers to a scalding degree and just kept plain 'ol messin up. Kitchen staff was, I'm pretty sure 75% of the problem, but tbh there are tons of burger places in this area, don't bother here. I don't want to wait for my food while everyone else eats because the kitchen didn't tell my waitress they're out of my toppings right before everyone else's comes out. Sucks."}
{"text":"Wednesday nights is family trivia night! It is becoming our tradition .. why?  Because the food is stellar ..well no, but it is sports bar acceptable.  Because there are tons of TVs and it's a great atmosphere .. well no, but there are enough and you can see the sports action from almost any table.  No, we love Fat Willies because of the people.  They will even go out of their way to help people with special food requests because of a special diet!  The treat our boy like he was a man, give the adults great service and they even pay attention to our infant little girl making her giggle and smile.  This is a great family style place, relaxed and fun.  I truly recommend them for the sports .. and trivia .. loving family!  Thanks to the crew at Fat Willies, we love you guys!"}
{"text":"The first time we tried the restaurant was on a Saturday at lunch and the patio hadn't been cleaned from Friday night with dishes still on the tables. The happy hour beer selection is excellent and the pizza is pretty good but unfortunately, they failed our number one bar food test, the nacho test! Their nachos are quite possibly the worst we've ever had. Don't be fooled by the 'queso' description on the menu, the queso is simply a small lump of slightly warmed cheese sauce plunked on top of a bowl of cold dry chips and completely flavorless ground beef.   Lastly, we are big fans of eating outdoors this time of year and but unfortunately, the small patio is used as the smoking section for the restaurant so it is thick with cigarette smoke making it a nasty experience.  Because the servers are always pleasant and the happy hour beer prices are good we may be back for a beer, but it won't be the local dinner spot we'd hoped it would be."}
{"text":"The place was great. The waitress Sam another story. Very unsociable, you ask her for drinks she just walks away.  She has no emotions, good or bad. Attitude depends on tips and customers returning."}
{"text":"Average sports bar food. A little pricey for what you get. Food was also just average. Seating wasn't great, not a lot of space."}
{"text":"Here only to see a friend of mine as the food is crap. Order a Jack and Coke only to find out they are out of Jack Daniel's. How do you not have a common alcohol such as that in stock? Is this the owners first restaurant? I long for the days when service and food stood for something."}
{"text":"Great food. Terrible service.  We love there burgers and wings. Pizza - meh.  Usually under staffed during busy times. Try and have the bartender work the entire bar and all the tables.....doesn't work.  Then, when slow, can't get any service. They have the Juke box cranked with dance music and can't even hear all the sports channels they have on the great big screen TV's. In the middle of a game this has happened. Had to ask the bartender what happened to the sound of the game while I could hear is rap. REALLY? In the middle of a game??? Done with them. I guess that's why it's dead now while it use to be packed. They will be gone soon and that is too bad because it use to be great place."}
{"text":"First time! Super friendly staff! Jen took care of us and gave us all the daily specials and events that go on.  Really welcoming and an awesome happy hour! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We try to like this place, we really do!  We like to walk here from our home, which should make for a nice evening, but the service is so spotty it is hard to enjoy the experience.  We usually choose the patio, and often feel invisible there.  We have gotten into the habit of getting our own water and menus because otherwise we could wait 30 minutes.  Recently it seems to be getting worse.  Their system of \"anybody who is close is your wait staff\" just doesn't work.  We never feel like anyone really understands customer service.  When I have complained, the manager has been a combination of aloof and rude.  Not good.  We decided yesterday that it is time to stop trying to like a poor place and just find a new one."}
{"text":"We frequent Fat Willy's very often. Beer is good and cold. Food is consistently good. Not gourmet but good and the portions are nice. Pizza is hit or miss but can be top notch (ask if Mike is at the oven).  It is the staff that keep us coming back. They are always so friendly and helpful. Fridays and Mondays are crazy so get there early or late. The older crowds take over the place for the burger and fish/ chips specials.  Recommend the burgers and wraps along with the pizza."}
{"text":"Fun place!  Fun place to hangout! Staff is very responsive. Lots of TVs to watch sports. Morgan the bartender is great!"}
{"text":"Good variety of reasonably priced food & great drink specials. Fun place to watch a game & have dinner with the guys or the family."}
{"text":"Great food for a sports bar, decent beer selection and friendly staff. I go quite often."}
{"text":"New in town and my hubby loves this sports bar because of their food and service and TV sports options.  He loves to create his own pizza with jalape√±os and pepperoni.  Beer is cold.  Nice assortment of daily specials and happy hour."}
{"text":"Have been to this location 3 times and service and food has gotten progressively worse.  First time wings were cold but service was good they reordered wings with out to much waiting time.  Second visit ordered fish and chips fish was overcooked didn't think you could turn fish into leather,  they did.  Trying to get this resolved took forever each time we spoke to someone said they would take care of it,  it didn't happen rest of party finished meal before I could get it resolved cancelled the new order and didn't eat they wouldn't take first order off bill.  Thought I would give the one more try tonite,  ordered meal with mashed potatoes, potatoes came out with ice in them solid I the middle,  when I finally got attention of server she said it would be right out.  Again finished meal before potatoes were back.  I had to pay for full meal and only got half of it,  I will not go here again this service is terrible,  you never see same server twice could explain why could explain cold food ?"}
{"text":"I have tried numerous times to get my food cooked right the first time without any luck!  I'm not sure why I keep giving Fat Willy's another opportunity to get it right. The manager has commented about how the cooks just can't get it right and have comped my dinner a few times,  but just can't get it right. If you want a rare or medium rare burger, don't go to this place! I have sent back more than one burger only to have it brought back out cooked well done. All my friends have had similar issues with how the food is prepared. It seems the cooks/ manager or owners don't care how you want your dinner served."}
{"text":"Server was extremely attentive. Checked in several times, despite it being just her. Food was out in 10 minutes or so. Not the best breed of fish for the fried fish but taste was original and artisan. Very clean environment, great bathrooms. Lots of tvs to choose from to watch different sports. Definitely seems to have a chummy local clientele.   One of the larger food selections for a sports bar that I've been to. Drinks I was served were served quickly and ice cold (even though I said no ice).   Not the most diverse place on earth but it's Chandler, AZ, and the server treated me the same as everybody else and I saw her cater to specific needs of families with children.   Overall an excellent experience for a hole in the wall place I found on a hot day. Definitely recommend.  Oh and the people leaving one star reviews while praising half the service or stupid parts of the experience are absolute losers who should get off the internet."}
{"text":"Yuck! Bad service!  We sat down and ordered.Getting refills was hard to do . My son had ordered an order of hot wings and fries and the rest of us ordered normal food. We told the waitress that the wings and fries were his dinner. Wings and fries come out with 5 plates. He was done eating by the time the rest of us got our dinner. Pretty awesome.  A family of 5 got seated shortly after we did. They sat there and no one came and even checked in with them. 10 minutes in, they just stood up and left.  This shows the level of service.  All this would be tolerable if the food was spectacular. It wasn't. It was barely adequate."}
{"text":"Nothing to go crazy about.  Average food. The bar is for older people. I went on a Friday with some buddies (late 20s) and it was empty and we were by far the youngest people there."}
{"text":"I stopped going to Fat Willis because the food and service became horrible.  I wanted to give them a second chance and went in for lunch today with my family.  That was a big mistake!  The server got our order wrong and we received one of the hamburgers completely raw.  When we informed the owner  Chris he didn't seem to really care!  We will not be back to Willies ever again. To bad because I live in Augusta Ranch.  No worries we have the VUE and the HUB!"}
{"text":"Their nuclear wings are amazing!!! Order them light sauce extra crispy and have them char them up on the grill when they're done.  They are out of this world!!  $3.50 giant beer steins for happy hour.  The perfect combo."}
{"text":"So, I have been here 3 times now and this is the worst time yet. The bartender has spoken with us twice and I have been here for almost 2 hours. We had to flag him down to order food. I always love the food but the cheese with the pretzels was gross. There are maybe 10 people at the bar and 2 servers, but still being ignored. Sit at a table for bettwr service."}
{"text":"I have to agree with other reviews about the service. Upon arriving, I ordered a drink and was told they did not carry that particular brand. I said fine, give me a minute. The bartender gave me a very annoyed look like I was putting her out and walked away. I then had to wait a good 15 minutes for her to return. There were only seven people in the place and I was with 3 of them. Also ordered an appetizer that was dry and burned. I had planned on going back on a Monday for their advertised $5.00 burger, but I will spend my money elsewhere...even if it costs more. Very poor customer service !"}
{"text":"Great food!  Fast friendly service. I was greeted right away. My drink was never empty and my burger was cooked perfectly. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"The chicken wings are amazing. In fact.. I don't eat chicken wings but my 5 year old loves them from FW.  The salads are great.. but sadly, they are always inconsistent. Always different sizes, never the right ingredients...Much like their service.. we've had amazing servers (like Mark) and several that are subpar.  For a neighborhood place, it's perfect."}
{"text":"sad to report, this place has gone downhill, hard and fast. First we started losing some of our favorite bartenders then suddenly the A/C wasn't working. I can understand a weekend where this may happen so they get it fixed but we were in after that and sitting in the barstool our legs were dripping with sweat. It seems whoever is the new manager or owner doesn't feel it necessary to run the a/c in Arizona. We will no longer be back."}
{"text":"Visiting town and needed WiFi and lunch, wow - what a find!  I came on Monday, not knowing it's $5 Burger so why not.  They have about 8 to choose from and all of them looked great, but what would you get for $5?  How about a California Burger, 1/2# juicy loaded with guac and all the toppings - had to share before I left the place.  Saw a ton of burgers being served and it's mid-afternoon, but staff is very friendly and everything is fresh.    Tues - kids free Wed - 60 cent wings Thur - Happy Hour 2-7 and 10 to close Fri -- Fish Fry  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My young family was looking for a quick solution to last minute dinner plans. We placed our order by phone for pickup. Everything straight off the menu. It was prepared on time.   The southwesternCobb salad was beautiful looking but had zero flavor. The to-go box also had an excessive amount of water puddled under the lettuce.   The 12\" pizza was fine, nothing spectacular.   The shrimp and chips basket was actually very good.   The kids past with \"red sauce\" was gross. So were the kids butter noodles.  We've been there once before but just for drinks and appetizers. Pretty sure that's the only purpose we'd go back after this experience."}
{"text":"Good place to open a Resturant  Poor service Had to flag down server no checking back  Hamburger over cooked  Had to ask for drinks twice to get first  One and then ask again for refills   Food so so nothing special  Won't be back"}
{"text":"My family and I came here yesterday, 5/17 at 12:15 pm for lunch. It wasn't very busy, had maybe 5 tables filled and a few people at the bar. We got seated and ordered and then waited. And waited. And waited. The waitress did not come by once during the time we waited to refill drinks or give us an update. We were about to cancel our orders and leave 45 minutes after we ordered, but then our food came out. No apologies, no acknowledgement of our wait, nothing.   The food was barely mediocre. I got a turkey, bacon, and avocado wrap that was so salty it covered the taste of everything else. My husband got a French dip that was bland. My onion rings were also really salty and were soggy. I was kicking myself wishing we had gone to Wildflower or Paradise down the street for something lighter and fresher. We spent $40 on a crappy lunch that took FOREVER to get with two hungry kids in tow. Never, ever will I come her again. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Fat Willys was recommended to us by some friends, unfortunately, we won't be back.  My son ordered nachos which he couldn't eat (he can always eat nachos). He said he has better from little league field concession stands, which judging by the processed cheese and packaged chips, that seemed accurate.  My wife had the fish tacos.  She said they were okay but not great, especially for the price.  I ordered a small pizza and it was terrible.  Similar to my son's description of his nachos, the pizza was worse than you can get at a concession stand.  I had two small slices and found it was just not edible.  Between the three of us, we ended up leaving 3/4 of the food we ordered uneaten.  The staff was pleasant, although the service was slow.  We have tried several other sports bars in the area and so far this is the only one we have decided we will not to return to.  We wish them luck."}
{"text":"I come here 1-2 times a month to have a drink and a burger with friends or my kids... On Mondays it's $5 burgers. Good deal for decent bar food. Nothing special though. Stay clear of the nacho cheese!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, cute girl bartender, cold beer, what else do you need! Yelp special is $1 dollar for a pint and FourSqaure special has a 25 cent pint special, nice!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for breakfast  as we received a BOGO. The only reason I gave this place a 1 star was for the mere purpose of writing the review.  Service was absolutely terrible and excruciatingly slow.  We had been sitting for 15 minutes before the server even approached our table....and another 15 just waiting for the drinks.  Needless to say., after our food finally arrived , the potatoes looked like they had been sitting there for hours...brown, dry and cold.  Eggs were cold and not made as ordered, toast was cold...it was an absolute nightmare! Terrible experience! Dont waste your time and money...and your taste buds!"}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews, I had a low expectations. But nonetheless we were helping a school fundraiser.   I ordered the quesadilla burger medium and got a medium. And juicy quesadilla burger.  It was really good. Hot and fresh.   The only it needed was some salsa and it would be a 5 star.  The waitress was attentive,  and the manager did come over towards the end to check on us."}
{"text":"Horrible service! My wife and I went there for dinner on a Saturday night. When the girl working the front finally came to the front, we were seated. Not the end of the world. We found what we wanted to order and waited, and waited, and waited.... We saw the waiter going to tables that had already been served around our table, but apparently we weren't worth the trouble for him to even take our drink order. The had a pretty full house, but they definitely weren't slammed. Service sucked bad!!!"}
{"text":"This is the original Fat willy's here in the valley. I have been to all of the locations and this is the best one for me. I have always had great service here and the staff is always friendly. I don't go here as often as i used to, ( quit drinking ) but pop in once in awhile to grab food. I have been to parties here for friends and family and they are always so accommodating. I like the breakfast in the morning ( used to like the tasty dirty bloody mary's ) and the burgers are always great. Happy hour menus with good prices and beer was always cold and glass was always full. I like the patio area and have had everything from pedicures to massages on the patio, there are always all kinds on the patio. I will keep coming back til they give me a reason not to."}
{"text":"Been coming here regularly for over a year.  Used to love the Friday all you can eat fish and chips.  Just left there totally disappointed.  The breading was twice the size of the fish and soggy.  My wife had potato skins and the bacon was nearly raw.   It was crowded so maybe the kitchen was in a hurry but there's no excuse for the size of the fish.  It also seemed to be a cheaper variety of fish than they used to serve. Bottom line:  I'll be finding a new Friday fish fry."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very close to our neighborhood and 5 years ago we would do 5.00 burgers with our boys. The quality of the food and cleanliness of the restaurant went from average to poor so we stoped going for a few years. In the past few months we started going back because it appeared to be clean and the food quality was average again. Last week we went for brunch before running some errands and I received some extra protein in my Denver omelet. It was a small roach that I bit into. I was very careful not to scream or vomit  and was very careful to make sure what I thought was a roach was really one before alerting the staff. Our server handled it professionally but the manager was less than professional. He told me that it was just some debris from the fryer and not a roach. I told him debris does not have little legs and I know what I bit into. He told me that he would take it off our bill. We will not be going back to this establishment ever again. I understand stuff happens in the restaurant business and that is not why we will not be back it is the way it was handled. I believe this manager should be better trained on how to handle situations like mine. Maybe our waitress could train him. The manager made it seem like I was trying to get a free $7.99 breakfast. I could have given two s#%ts about the money. Hopefully the owners will read this and do some training and clean up the food prep area."}
{"text":"This is one of the newest Fat Willys and i have to say their service was pretty good. I like thats its bigger than the one on crismon which i usually go to. The setup is much nicer too. The food is excellent as usual. They have the best spinach artichoke dip, wings, luv the  the quesadillas & mozzarella sticks too..oh dont forget the delish burgers. $5 Burgers on Mondays"}
{"text":"We come for the breakfast and it's always amazing, have been here many times with no issues on service or food.   The last time we came, we ordered and it has been awhile with no food being delivered or nobody giving us an update. Finally we flagged somebody down to ask about the food, they went to go check and said \"We had an issue with the ticketing system, so your order never made it to the kitchen.\" Meanwhile, tables who came in after us had their food and why didn't our server notice we had no food and take it upon herself to look into our food? She said they would put the rush order in and get our food out right away, but after 15 minutes later and no food, no apology, no drink refill, we left. We would've tried to pay for our 1 drink or explain why we're leaving, but we couldn't even find anybody.  We'll be back because I'm sure it was an off day, but we used to go every few weeks and since this incident in January, we haven't been back. It really put a sour taste in our experience."}
{"text":"I was driving home and thinking hey, it's Friday, it's afternoon and it's a holiday weekend - where can I go? The Yelp mobile app said Fat Willy's was close by and like Toucan Sam, I followed my nose...or at least my iPhone.  The bar had plenty of spacing and I was impressed with the layout when I entered. The bar had several seats and there were multiple televisions directly behind the bar as well as each side. There were a few guys at the bar, just hanging out with a friend or two and enjoying a few brews and sports. They all seemed to know the place and it was a good atmosphere. The bartender was cool and asked me what I wanted to drink, as well as ran down the happy hour prices. $4 for a large beer sounded good. I went with the Coastal Wheat. The glass was a monster - I asked a lady there how big the classes were and she said 25 oz - but I swear it was bigger (guys always think it's bigger)....  But I digress...$4 for the monster beer and $4 for a 10 piece wings. I ordered the 'hot\" and to be honest, it wasn't that hot. They had a good flavor and came with blue cheese...After I nearly completed my second beer I decided to visit the men's room. When I turned around, I was again surprised. I thought it was just the bar and the room, and that the restroom was around the corner - no - there was a long hallway with more seating, and I noticed outdoor seating. I finally made it to the bathroom - Hello, Elvis on the door. When I returned, I asked what the draught beer on the end was - the bartender indicated it was a yet to be named amber beer. He said a contest will be had to name it and offered a taste in the cutest little mug. I tasted it and well, it didn't blow my skirt up. I would name it ho-hum, but that's just me. This time I went cheap and hit the $3 Miller Lite in the same 25oz mug. Nice!  All in all, it was a good adventure to Fat Willy's - and what a name :-) This would definitely be a place I would be a repeat offender at if I lived closer. Tons of space and televisions, good happy hour prices and a nice, attentative wait staff."}
{"text":"So disappointing... Margarita had no flavor,  charged full price for happy hour items, fish fry VERY over cooked,  frys were cold, charged more than menu price for kids items.  Not once were we asked how our meal was. The waitstaff brought my daughter the wrong flavor shake and just said 'oh sorry' but would not bring the correct flavor(and then over charged us for the wrong one). This meal was a huge waste of money. I would never recommend this place, unless you want to be over charged for bad food."}
{"text":"Food was ok but the portions were small.  The main problem was the fact that the place is just not very clean and smelled stale.  Unfortunately will not be back to give them a second chance.  Especially considering Blue 32 is not too far down the road."}
{"text":"OMG $5 monday burgers. I always get the buffalo sauce and bleu cheese..... but hey, that's just me."}
{"text":"John V the bartender was great... They have a good team that works here... If you haven't been here, come check it out"}
{"text":"Poor Service:  Large group but place was not busy. Waited forever for drinks complained told they where busy. Waited longer for food which was so so. Server disorganized had trouble separating checks. Took again forever to get bill straight !!!"}
{"text":"Can't give this restaurant a Star but I have to give one to put out a post , customer service and food was horrible. What's happening to people today. Customer service should be everything. She threw out excuses and didn't even try to fix anything. Her tip will reflect!!!!!!! Jocelyn needs to smile and treat customer like she would want to be treated!!!!!!"}
{"text":"$9.25 for a smallish mug of beer?!! Wow!! Absolutely astounding. Not very helpful about telling you what's on happy hour, and pricing was not transparent."}
{"text":"Sorry Fat Willy's on Greenfield...we really wanted to like you because we live just around the corner but boy your food was BAD! Stale chips, no flavor salsa, the worst queso I've ever had, the mac n cheese was so dry you could stick your spoon in it and no cheese sauce would be on the spoon...it looked like you cooked it days ago, kept it in the fridge then microwaved it....super lame. We ordered 2 sauces on our wings...Hot & Mango Habanero....both tasted the same...like strong vinegar. I asked for a side of honey hot sauce thinking it would help the taste ....but lol it tasted like vinegar as well! I think this place should just stick to being a bar....we did like the beer!"}
{"text":"Service sucks. 30 minutes for a drink & menu. Food is average, at best. Don't think they'll survive here. Tough area for restaurants, and you have to offer more than another mediocre sports bar."}
{"text":"Not sure it's worth writing this review, chances are good by the time you read it this joint will be out of business.   They have gone downhill rapidly primarily with food quality. The bartenders for the most part are very good but there one (thin guy) that fills in that's just plain rude and disrespectful to most people, some regular customers he's chummy with and pretty decent. I will not return to this place until he is gone. Hard to pay good hard earned money to be treated like crap for nothing.   Sad to see them go or at least struggle it's a great neighborhood bar location. Maybe someone will buy them and put some $ back into the business rather than drain the cash out at expense of customer service and food quality.    Truly wish them the best!"}
{"text":"Dangerous!!!  Our meal was so so, had to send back the margarita, and we ordered lemon pepper wings that had virtually no lemon pepper on them.  When we ordered dessert, I asked if the brownie had nuts, the server said \"I'm not sure, but I know for sure the blonde brownie doesn't\".  I said sure.  It came out with a scoop of ice cream covering the whole thing so I couldn't see that it was filled with huge walnut chunks.  I took one bite, started to react and went to the bar to get water.  As we are trying desperately to get out of there so I can get some benadryl, my dad has to stay behind to pay the bill.  They took off my dessert that I couldn't eat and my mom's dessert. That was it.  Very scary for a nut allergy to be told that something for sure doesn't have nuts.  My dad sent an email right when we got home and we haven't heard anything back.  We absolutely won't return and it's doubtful any of our friends will either."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  How does Fat Willy's stay in business?   You will wait for a very long time to get seated, and then you will wait for a very, very long time to have a server take your order.  The quality of their food has decreased over time also."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant/ bar since the grand opening. The place was always a favorite but it has been on a slow decline for months. There are a few decent staff members and T is a great bartender but neither were there today as we were acknowledged as we entered but not even asked for our drink order after sitting for 10 minutes. Took our regular business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous time enjoying my birthday and watching football. Great food and drinks!!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and they have great specials. They have a good variety of beers, drinks and bar specials. Love the atmosphere for families. The biggest problem is the service. We've been 5+times (different server every time) and always have terrible/slow service. The last time we had 4 adults and 3 kids. All of our food came out one at a time over the course of 30 mins. After waiting over 30mins for the first dish. We got a large pizza first. Then the sandwich and wings. The kids meals and salads were last. Those should be easy to get out. Over all it was a 90 min lunch, not by choice.   We keep going back because the food is good. And it's the only restaurant of its kind in the area. However, management should really work on their food times and encourage servers to be more attentive.     UPDATE!  We've been 3-4 times since this post and the service has been much better. I did have to sent my food back last Sunday because it was cold but everything else was perfect.   Another update: take out sucks and always takes 15-25 mins longer than they say. Pizzas were ready on time. Waited 20mins for a salad."}
{"text":"Me and the hubby went in while Walmart was changing the battery on our car. So not a place we sought out but more out of convenience.   We both ordered a hamburger- I had a cheeseburger and he ordered a Southwest burger. Mine was ok- over cooked, cheap bun but ok. Fries were about average but I liked them. My husband didn't like his Southwest burger at all. Said the flavor of the BBQ was too sweet and he said the patties were pre made {pet peeve for both of us} but edible.   We sat at the bar because there was only one person working the whole restaurant. He shook our hands and asked our names..? I guess they want to be the Cheers of Greenfield and Baseline.   Fine- but nothing to drive out of your way for."}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying that five stars in this case does not mean everything is great food wise... but I love this place. Awesome beer selection. The wait staff is always friendly, though they have been going through a lot of changes recently. Daily lunch and happy hour specials are great. I would recommend the $5 burger on Mondays. I am quite happy with their wings. Most of the sandwiches are good as well. The real deal is just to sit there drinking a few beers watching a game or coming for one of their parties. It is a true sports bar with lots of both going on."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place.  My husband discovered it recently after we moved and had really talked it up.  However, I just can't give it more than 2 stars for some specific reasons..  My biggest issue is that when they brought my veggie plate, the baby carrots appeared to be AT LEAST 2 weeks old. They were completely soft and flexible and white.  I'm not exaggerating. It was disgusting. When the waitress came back I calmly asked her \"Excuse me, but I'm just wondering, do you think these are appropriate to serve?\". She was shocked and apologized and said she would talk to the manager.  A few minutes later another waitress brought out a plate with about 5 new baby carrots on it.  They never asked to clear the spoiled ones- leaving them on the table the entire meal, and the manager never came over at all to even check it out.  My real gripe is that obviously no one was paying attention to what they were serving, and more importantly, the manager didn't even care to come apologize for serving spoiled food.  My smaller issue was the timing of our food being served. I ordered the appetizer veggie plate and nachos and specifically said they would be my meal.  My son ordered a 9\" cheese pizza, which came out about 5 minutes after my food.  My husband ordered a burger which came out 5 minutes after my sons (10 minutes after mine).  It was not even remotely busy- there were maybe 2 other occupied tables in the restaurant section total.  It wasn't the end of the world, but definitely longer than it should have been.  That being said, the drink prices were great, and my son loved the pizza, but I just cannot get over the spoiled food!"}
{"text":"Great for a quick getaway for a game food is pretty good and reasonable very nice people tho"}
{"text":"Traveling seniors  This place is closed, look like another joint is going in at this location!"}
{"text":"This place has went in the wrong direction. Ordered happy hour wings got 5 pigeon wings that had no meat for $6.  Also Ordered happy hour potatoe wedges 4 slices for $5.  Used to love coming here but prices are way higher now, food has also went downhill.  Save your money and go to Uncle Bears."}
{"text":"Ok - I'll admit it.  I'm not a fan of sports bars because the food is usually the same no matter which one you go to, they're noisy and well....I am a bit of a food snob. We've had a decent (not great) burger here, the pizza was pretty bland and I had to ask the waiter 3 times for a glass of water. On our last visit, we split the nachos (served cold with some congealed 'meat' and the usual ingredients - that nasty fake cheese sauce).  They'd been sitting under a heat lamp which didn't help.  The fish and chips are ok - we also split the order.  The fish is quite good and cooked to perfection.  The slaw is so-so, the fries ok. I think I've had enough of this place.....I miss the old Red/White/Brew that was in this space because they had a more varied menu."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and I was shocked! This place is awesome. The food is great and you can't beat the prices. The service is as good as the food. The people who have left the negative reviews are crazy."}
{"text":"Underwhelming. Out of miller lite on draft. Second time experienced.  Southwest egg rolls are not what is depicted on menu. Waffle fries used in carne asade fries were hard as a rock. Chili's much much better and same pricing during happy hour. Pizza is decent. Decent patio although they allow dogs. Server was super nice. Not sure if they are trying to replicate chili's or uncle bears but nothing stood out that would lead me to return."}
{"text":"Need more servers. Good happy hour. Don't take a big group. We were there for just about an hour and our drinks were still not served.  The server took our order, twenty mins had passed and we asked about our food, the server said the order was not put in yet.  Not food for groups"}
{"text":"Ive been here a few times. I like their food. Its average. Service seems to always be nice. TVs everywhere. I would go back here from time to time."}
{"text":"This place has no atmosphere. They have your typical bar food and okay service."}
{"text":"If I could give them zero stars I would. We had a man named John taking care of us and I have never been so disgusted with the service we received. Literally the worst waiter I have ever come across. He had the nastiest attitude and barely served us. Mind you, my family and I have been coming to Fat Willys for a couple years now and the service has only gotten worse and worse. The only thing that keeps us coming back is the prices on draft beer. Otherwise we would be going to places with much better employees and management. I recommend others to stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"The service was great, the restaurant is freezing cold, it can be a lil noisy so I much prefer to order take out from there."}
{"text":"The food really was good but everything else was just awful! We went on Burger Monday so we weren't surprised that the place was full but we could see 2 empty tables going unbussed while we waited. They also apparently have a policy of quoting a half hour wait for a table on mondays even if they have several that just need cleared. This makes no sense to me.   Once we were seated we quickly realized that the tables were not getting cleared because our waiter didn't really feel like working. He stood up near the door socializing for a good 10 minutes at a time until he eventually seated a girl near us so he could visit with her. We had to ask twice for condiments and drained our drinks completely and had a bit of a wait before we could get the waiter to refill for us.   We also both thought the boothes were uncomfortable. We felt like we were a mile from the table but also the back of the booth tilts forward at the top and it pushes taller people the exact opposit of the normal, comfortable seating position where you're tilted back a bit.   At least one of the tables that was empty when we arrived remained uncleared the entire time we were there. Thanks to the policy of telling people there's a 30 minute wait though, no one was waiting for tables anymore. I think they all left. I kind of wish I'd gone with them."}
{"text":"Sports bar with plenty of TVs. The food is your typical bar food. Service was good/friendly. They have local high school stuff up that is fun and it seems to bring in the local crowd. Happy hour is also decent."}
{"text":"Four stars for drinks&great customer service stop by for a drink at the bar was not disappointed first time here will not be the last manager & our bar tender were vice nice the gave us a drink on them because they were out of club soda now that's how you should run a business did not have a chance to try out any food items but will be back only thing I think they need a little up dating done"}
{"text":"Came in for a quick bite to eat for lunch. I was promptly greeted by my server mark and sat in a  booth. I was really craving wings so I went with their special for 10 for $11 not bad at all.  I went with the Jamaican jerk and cajun for my flavors.   I was really disappointed when I got my wings. There was barely any seasoning on the wings. They were so bland..  i ask for extra seasoning  and add salt and pepper because the flavor was just lacking.    My server was very attentive and personable. I will definitely be back but won't be getting the wing.  Servises 5 Stars Food quality 3 starts  Fast service 5 stars"}
{"text":"We eat at Fat Willy's probably once a month, We always find the service to be good and the food tasty and cooked to order!"}
{"text":"Had to update my original review. Since discovering this neighborhood bar a couple weeks ago we have become regulars. Must have been here at least 6 times and each time has been consistently good. Monday night 6 dollar burgers are a great deal! Burgers are so yummy! Salads too. So I bump it up from 3 to 4 stars  for good service and  consistency. :-)"}
{"text":"$5 burgers on Mondays!  Just make sure you don't come here in the winter time on Monday.  It may be a long wait.  It looks like the rest homes unload ALL their old snowbirds.  ;-)  Food is good."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try last night. Jamie was our server and she was awesome. We were pleased to learn that arrived during happy hour (2-7pm daily). We ordered a few cheap beers which were about $3 to $4 and appetizers, which were $5 each. My husband decided to order some bone out wings and he said they were amazing. My friend ordered garlic knots and he ordered his daughter a quesadilla. Jamie was very attentive, friendly, and informative. She asked us if this was our first time coming in and when we told her it was she made sure to let us know about the weekly specials. She honestly made our visit enjoyable and we will be returning because of the decent food and the great service. I am going to surprise my husband and bring him in on a Monday night for a $5 burger. Shhh, don't tell him."}
{"text":"We usually go to the Baseline address.  We're meeting friends.  The wait for food was forever and other than the bar there was only guests at two other tables.  Not busy at all. Food was terrible"}
{"text":"We came on Mother's Day, having the expectation of it being busy. To our surprise it was fairly empty.  We sat without any service for several minutes, finally getting up and grabbing the menus ourselves. Our server was alone working the entire restaurant. She was doing great attending our needs as best as she can. Being in the industry, we were surprised to see no manager , no bartender or any support staff in sight. You'd think on a holiday they'd have enough staff to get accommodate. Food took a while to come out, half the table got their food and it took a while for the rest of our table to receive their food. Food was good. Our server did great, we just wish there was more staff to help her out and make things go a little smoother for customers."}
{"text":"Been traveling and had some crappy experiences lately, so thought I'd write some reviews on restaurants that are awesome.  Fat Willy's is about a mile away from my house, and my fiance and my go-to place to eat when dining out on the weekends. Why? Let me tell you...  2-7 is HAPPY HOUR.. You can get these giant 26(?)oz beers for just $3 each... super cheap. Also, their whole appetizer menu is $5 each... and pretty much everything on that menu is delicious. We generally go here, order 2-3 appetizers, a bunch of drinks, and leave extremely satisfied.   Worth noting - the wait staff is awesome. Each one we've had has made time to sit down and chat with us, and even get to know us after repeat business. They are always prompt at keeping our drinks full and our food out quickly.  One last note - one night we were there while they had dueling pianos. It was an awesome experience and the atmosphere was awesome. We were there just by chance, but would be willing to buy tickets for the event next time.   Without a doubt one of my favorite restaurants and would recommend as well as take visitors to.  One last thing I would get in trouble for not mentioning - their strawberry dessert is DELICIOUS... I'm not a dessert guy but this thing is outstanding and I can never resist having at least a few bites."}
{"text":"Apparently my last review was censored. Waitress was extremely rude. Told us we were eating too many unlimited wings and the restaurant wasn't making money."}
{"text":"Meh, it was just o.k.  My husband and I stopped after a movie on the way to pick up our son from grandma's.  It was happy hour (after 10pm) so we order the garlic knots.  They were somewhat underdone but we didn't say anything because we were hungry and needed to get going.  The knots came with pizza sauce which we didn't care for (tasted like the can it came out of).  I got the fish tacos and my husband got the Asian Chicken salad.  My tacos were editable but not a lot of flavor.  My husband said his salad was ok but it didn't look right to me.  Chicken breast over spring mix with Asian dressing and a few fried wantons.    The music was too loud and their was a table of employees sitting in a booth eating.  With so many choices in the area, we will likely never return."}
{"text":"filthy with apathetic staff and cold food.  you probably could catch an std there, too."}
{"text":"Great wings, lots of screens, and not too noisy, but ridiculously slow on Sundays.  This is the second time I've been here on Sunday for lunch and again I should have brought a cot. They shouldn't be open for lunch if they can't turn it around quicker than this."}
{"text":"First time here & was quite happy with everything. Service was great, food really good. Skipped the Monday night crowd by arriving around 6:30. Had the breakfast burger sans bun, while hubby had the Southwestern BBQ burger. Very filling with fries. And you really can't beat the $6 price! We'll be back one Friday for the fish fry.  Note to newbies like us: The $6 burger promo is with the purchase of a drink. This was kindly pointed out to us by our server, so this water drinker ordered the iced tea & a milkshake. It was worth it."}
{"text":"We just moved to the neighborhood and we were looking for that new local spot, we were nervous after reading the reviews about slow or bad service.  My wife and I have been several times just for drinks as well as we have brought the whole family for lunch and dinner.  We have not had a bad experience yet!  My guess is some of these reviews may have been when they first opened and were not quite the fine oiled machine of today.  Good food and drink menu with reasonable pricing and specials.  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Chris is amazing!! We come here often being that this is our neighborhood bar. Gabby and Chris are so friendly and welcoming. We love stopping in at least twice a week. Such a wonderful family!!!! Thank you Fat Willys for having such a great staff and delicious food!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food for a sports bar!  Cheap drinks, great wings.. Im a fan!"}
{"text":"You can't beat Happy Hour at Fat Willy's.  $5 appetizers that are large enough to be a dinner entr√©e and great drink and beer specials.  Decent craft selection on tap.  Great staff, good drinks, reliable food, games are always on.  Good place to take the kids, too."}
{"text":"Screwed up 4 out of 6 orders for dinner.  No apology from anyone.  Clearly not focused on customers."}
{"text":"Came in and waited 12 minutes to finally get noticed.  Bartenders here are obviously more worried about carrying on conversations than actually looking around...  shitty experience"}
{"text":"We used to come here every week after work on the night shift. The staff knew us by name. The food was amazing. The drinks were plentiful. But over the past two years I have noticed a very steady decline and have changed my review from five stars to less than one. Our favorite servers have left. The place smells and looks like it's never cleaned. Our meals are always messed up somehow. Always. This last visit was just that: my last visit. The wait staff seemed irritated we were there. The bathrooms REAKED of vomit and urine (and this was at eight in the morning), the chairs were sticky and we left when a cockroach crawled up onto the booth seat right next to my friend. we grabbed the manager walking by and were alarmed and said \"boss there is a cockroach about to crawl over us!\" he SMASHED it on the booth seat right next to her. It was comical but I lost my appetite. Done. Done. And Done. So sad, have a lot of great memories there but I have had all the adventure I can take."}
{"text":"Well the start of the evening here was not great at all. We walked in and there was a sign that said wait to be seated. After waiting for ten minutes, no one came to seat us. We wanted to sit on their patio, so went went to their patio which had another sign that said see hostess for seating. Well what's the point of that if there isn't one. After finally just seating ourselves, we waited for a waitress to come by to help us. Another ten minutes go by, then someone finally decides to show up. At this point I was about ready to leave. The waitress asked what we wanted to drink, well we didn't even get menus so we could order.  After finally getting menus and ordering, I ordered a banana cream martini. This was not what I expected at all. It was delicious and extremely strong. I couldn't even tell you what I ordered because the entree is not on their online menu. It was a wrap with turkey, bacon, avocado, tomato, lettuce and a chipotle sauce I believe. (see picture)  All in all, I would probably just come back for their drinks and sit at the bar since that's the only way you'll get seated is when you seat yourself. Note to owners, don't put a sign in the front to be seated if you're not going to have people there to seat your customers."}
{"text":"Let's set the stage. 11:30am on a Saturday.  Only 3 tables occupied. Asked to change channel (no one watching TV) to another game. Waitress was dazed and confused and said only PAC12 on that TV....uh, it was actually SEC showing.  After we received our drinks...waitress forgot/ignored  us. After 20 mins of being ignored, we asked for our check to leave.  She said \"sorry 'bout that.\" (Don't think she was) First time posting a review on Yelp. It was that bad."}
{"text":"Ask for Jimbo's grilled wings, not on the menu. They are just the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is struggling due to service. There's so much potential with this location but attention to detail or even average service is tough to find. Draft beers are constantly out and the food depends on who shows up. This is a hit or major miss in this place. I see more regulars or people at Native that just are fed up"}
{"text":"Kitchen backed up with an hour wait and definitely not worth it when it came. Potatoes microwaved and rubber.  Lots of waitress motion carrying nothing and long delay to get another round. All this when the place wasnt half filled. One on our party didnt get food until the rest of us were nearly done.."}
{"text":"The place has great food and service. If you happen to sit at the bar where the bartenders are. There is a putrid smell coming from some where? I have sat at the bar twice and have smelled it both times. The bar needs to find what is causing this smell or they will lose customers."}
{"text":"Pretty good food for a sports bar. Excellent happy hour from 2-7 everyday! $2-$3 draft beers and $3 Smirnoff Jack and Bacardi."}
{"text":"Nice local bar, restaurant is good, service is great, but it's always freezing cold!  That's great when it's 120 outside but give a manager the key to the thermostat!"}
{"text":"Where to start?  The $5 burger Mondays are great.  I don't eat beef but they let you substitute for a chicken breast which is awesome!  I went with my daughter for some daddy-daughter time and they got her order wrong.  The waitress immediately offered to take it off the bill.  When her food came it was hot and fresh and clearly had just been made.    We had two chicken burgers, she had a soda and I had a beer and my total was less than $8 because of the error.  You simply can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Been to this location twice in the last 2 weeks. The first time it was a bit late, 9:30ish but it was on the way home from a long drive. My husband ordered the southwest Cobb salad and I ordered a BBQ bacon cheese burger. We both enjoyed the food, but the service was awful even though there was just a few tables occupied. The server took over 15 minutes to introduce herself and get our drink order. Another ten minutes to come back with our drinks (which were wrong) and then she didn't have time to get our dinner order even though we were ready, so we waited another ten minutes just to give our food order. We finally got our food about 25 minutes later and more drinks (yep, wrong again) as the tables around us were served their food and starting on dessert even though they came in well after us.  The second time....not my choice....but the in-laws wanted to go so....service much better and it was a  packed house. Three in my party ordered the fish and chips dinner and I ordered the Ultimate Philly cheese steak \"wit whiz\". I specifically asked for the \"whiz\" cheese instead of the mozzarella cheese but  it came with both cheeses anyway. And the so called \"whiz\" cheese was something you'd get from a crappy jr high carnival. DON'T ADVERTISE \"WIT WHIZ\" PHILLY if you don't actually have it!!"}
{"text":"Mondays are $5 burger days. The only place in town you can get a quesadilla burger with all the fixings. It will change the way you eat burgers. Keep an eye out for the local celebrity they call \"Handlebars.\""}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Wings are the best around. Very pet friendly on the patio. We brought our dog and the server brought him a bowl of water, and some snacks. Other servers even came out to see and pet him. Been here many times for happy hours, and so far everything we've tried is great."}
{"text":"Ive been coming here since it opened and have had several horrible run ins with the food. However, its a convenient location and the beer is cold so I keep  coming back when in the area for beer... I met 2 friends here for Thursday night NFL Kickoff to watch some football and have some drinks. The bartender and the staff is always friendly and courteous, and the place has a pretty good vibe to it.  After we had a couple brews my friends said they were hungry, and I also started getting a appetite. I had warned them that this place is notorious for having bad food from personal experiences... They said they wanted to get chow here. My buddy asked the waitress what was good, and of course she said \"everything\".... He got the fish and chips, and the waitress applauded his choice by saying its their best seller on Fridays. I got the French dip, and another friend got the Philly cheese steak.  Best way to explain the fish and chips was **In Donald Trumps voice** \"SAD\"... It joked with the waitress and asked if todays catch was bluegill since he got 3 tiny pieces of fish that looks like was flattened out before being battered.. It looked disgusting. The waitress apologized and said \"yeah, I saw that... Fridays we have better fish\". I asked her what that meant? Throughout the week they serve goldfish and on Fridays they sell the cod??? She took it as a joke and moved on.. My French dip looked **in Donald Trumps Voice** \"worst trade deal I ever made\". I could not believe I paid my hard earned money for this. There was barely any meat or fries. I swear I felt like they hired someone just to count the fries to make sure everyone gets just enough to be let down and disappointed... I have half the roll left over because it didn't have enough meat to reach the ends.  My friend that got the Philly I think was trying to be nice. She said oh its good..... and only ate half. The waitress told her there is a white sauce that comes on it, and she didn't know if she would like it or not so she asked for it on the side. When it came out, it was clearly queso... I was like Whaaaa..... Why...... Again, on her plate she seemed to just have enough fries to think the plate came with a discount.  Ill go back there for beer, but never again... Mark my words.... Will I ever eat there again.... 1 star for friendly waitress, and cold beer!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Typical beer and wings sports bar. Good for a large group and kids.  They do support the community sports, so for that I would go back."}
{"text":"So we stopped in here today after not going there in 2 years.. There was a sign out front stating Happy Hour specials which only listed beer and appetizers.. We went in and my husband ordered The beer that was on happy hour. I ordered a well vodka assuming there were no liquor happy hour prices being they were not listed on the sign..  we then asked for menu and reviewed it and noticed that Smirnoff was $4 on happy hour which was never brought to our attention... so I ordered a Smirnoff exact same drink for my second drink. Which she was  ready to pour as a well again.  We then got the bill and I was charged $5 for my no well (CHEAP) vodka and $4 for Smirnoff... THE BARTENDER SHOULD HAVE SAID IT IS $4 for Smirnoff!!! really that is terrible that you say nothing... lack of training or just do not care that they are overcharging customers!!!"}
