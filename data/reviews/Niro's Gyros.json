{"text":"Went to lunch here today and service was fast and friendly. 

Gryo meat was tasty and their Greek salad portion was large with plenty of everything. I really enjoyed the dressing. I am definitely returning again."}
{"text":"Best gyro outside of Chicago, hot dogs and beef rock too!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of their Italian Beef.  It is a large sandwich and you can have it with au jus or marinara sauce.  I also like their fries--they come with some of the skin on and they always taste fresh.  The grilled chicken pita is a nice alternative to the regular gyro meat (lamb?) since greasy meat is not my stomach's friend.  I love the pita bread and the sauce.  Their Greek salad is my favorite fast food salad.  Even the \"small\" is really big and generously topped with tomato, Greek olives, feta, mild white onions, and cucumber.  Yum!  

The one downside is that they are not good with delivery.  The times we ordered at the office it took way too long to get our food and the orders were always screwed up somehow.  They really need to get their large orders act together.  However, I have always had a good experience with an individual order in drive thru."}
{"text":"Tasty!

It looked like a good gyro should look, had the requisite onions and tomatoes and tzatziki sauce.  I ordered extra sauce, and for a nominal fee, was given a HUGE portion (awesome).  The fries were fine, and the price was right on par for a gyro combo meal.

As far as taste goes it was pretty right on, but the tzatziki could have used a touch more garlic, because I don't still taste it every time I burp...

Gross, I know, but, c'mon, you know what I mean."}
{"text":"If I am craving junk food, this is my favorite place. Love their pizza puffs, chilli cheese fries and the breaded mushrooms are just amazing. 
Not the right place for dieting, but YOLO, enjoy the food here haha."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago where the gyro is a big deal. These are the closest ones that I've found to my hometown. They even put the fries in a small brown bag. The meat tastes great, not microwaved like most places. Feels like a real family owned business."}
{"text":"When speaking about local eateries one must always keep in mind the tried and true classics. Niro's is definately one for the ages as it's menu offerings allow you to escape for a brief moment to the heart  of the Midwest and the flavors of Chicago. You can't miss when ordering up a couple Chicago dogs and their excellent fries. The Gyro Platter,(single, double ,triple... it just gets better) is an absolute victory. The real prize is the service and the fries, you won't leave disappointed!"}
{"text":"I went to Niro's on a recommendation from a coworker. I had never tried a Gyro before and it's close to work so why not?
I have been missing out. They are soooo good! I will definitely be back for more. :)"}
{"text":"I ate probably my second gyro ever here, so I can't really honestly compare, but this one was pretty good. We did order fries, and our meals didn't come with them but whatever."}
{"text":"Visiting from DC and saw a billboard for this gyro place.  Solid food here in the land of sunshine and tumbleweeds.  Weird eating Greek food in the southwestern desert but no stranger than eating a burrito in Paris.  

Meat was lean. Yogurt sauce was excellent.  Fries were okay.  All in all, a tasty cheap solid snack to fill the stomach."}
{"text":"Not only are the prices reasonable, but the food is delicious and the owners are always friendly and helpful.
.
I enjoy their chicken parmagiana sandwich and their timely service and visit Niro's as often as I can."}
{"text":"If I would have never ate at Pita Jungle, I would have maybe liked this place a bit more. The hamburger is good, but the Gyro was dry. Service is great, the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Best Gyro platter I've had in a long time!  I've been dying for some good gyro meat off a real spit for some time now and found it at Niro's. My husband and I stopped by this little jewel of a place on our trip from Chicago to Marion and liked it so much we stopped through again on our way from Marion to Chicago. Great food, super friendly counter service. I highly recommend :-)"}
{"text":"I love this place. I try to treat myself to a gyro meal once a month. They're always friendly and quick and oh yeah delicious! There is enough meat on one of these to make another whole gyro. Good prices considering the portion size. Over the years I've tried most things on their menu and it's all been good but my favorite will always be the gyro."}
{"text":"Great little place I found on Yelp. Signed up for text messages for discounts and got a Greek salad with Giro meat added on. Delicious and a great meal than fast food for a reasonable price.  Staff is very friendly and helpful.  I have also had giros which were wonderful.  Will be back."}
{"text":"I am pleased to say that this is a very delectable fast food greek restaurant. The food always seems to be freshly cooked to order, with phenomenal service in hand. It's a welcoming \"mom and pop\"  restaurant with well priced meals and entr√©es. I recommend the gyros Niro's serve, as they are the best locally."}
{"text":"Cannot think of a single time I have been to his location and had a bad experience. Excellent service and amazing greasy food. Great burgers, gyros, beef, sausage, philly steaks, and fries."}
{"text":"We went to Niro's all the time when we lived in Ahwatukee.  It's great.  My wife loved the greek fries.  Everything we tried from there was consistently good.  Their greek salad dressing is amazing.  The owner is typically in there and he's a really friendly guy.  Went there dozens of times and never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant  a zero, If that was an option. When I called in my order I was told that at the time they do not take orders over phone anytime in 30 minutes before closing unless you are within 5 minutes of the restaurant. I told them we were on our way, and was told we could order then. When I arrived at the location, they locked the door and turned off the lights, even though they still were supposed to be open for another 7 minutes. Given that gyro meat is constantly cooking and does not require more than 3 minutes to make a gyro, and the fact that they closed up when we arrived told me everything I needed to know about this restaurant. They wanted to close up early,  so they screwed the customer, me. The only thing you need to know where is this, don't go there. Because obviously they have really crappy customer service and if they do really crappy customer service you don't know what they're doing with your food."}
{"text":"Quick lunch there today...
Gyro sandwich was perfect. Fries were fresh and piping hot!
Fast, clean, casual lunch - appropriately priced.
Hope to try the Italian beef next time I'm in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Courteous cashier got me the best deal on my purchase (chicken gyro combo as opposed to a more expensive separate chicken gyro and small greek salad).

Chicken gyro was a great blend of thick sliced chicken, cucumber mayo dressing, onions, and tomatoes all on a soft warm pita. Greek salad had all the expected toppings: feta, tomatoes, onions, pepperchinis, onions and a vinaigrette. For being a rather fast order, food was delicious. Order was around 10 dollars."}
{"text":"Got the philly cheese and a maxwell style polish sausage. Philly had no flavor and the polish tasted and looked like it was from Costco."}
{"text":"Great little Greek restaurant at affordable prices. Had the gyro which was delicious. Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"This is as horrible for you as food gets in C-U.  But it is great.  Also, the staff is incredibly friendly at Niro's, I'm always impressed by them.  Their gyros are delicious, greasy and gigantic.  Definitely a once in awhile thing."}
{"text":"We love Niro's! The hot dogs and Italian beef sandwiches are dynamite! The Greek salad is big and fresh. The gyros are also excellent. I'm a French fry junkie and these are my favorite in Phoenix! Service is fast and prices are good. The owners are almost always there and make us feel so welcome!"}
{"text":"I've eaten Niro's Gyros gyro sandwiches and fries about 4 times, and I love them.  The gyros  are very flavorful and filling.  The fries are some of the best around.  I like the greek salads too.  Overall this is good food for a reasonable price.

I recommend it."}
{"text":"Excellent! Priced right, great food, great people. But be sure to ask for an extra pita, order one gyro and you'll see why."}
{"text":"I really like this place the food is good, fresh and the servings are generous. Service is prompt , can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Great food! I had the artichoke chicken pita at the recommendation of the owner. It was outstanding. Full of flavor & huge."}
{"text":"I was done eating and snacking on a last fry or two when I saw the owner cleaning tables. I was just getting up when he asked if I was done. Thinking he would take my tray I said yes. Instead he dumped the trash he had been collecting on my tray and told me to take it out too. Shocked, I did it. Upset at the service I called him and told him I thought it was in poor taste. He told me that if he had known I would be so sensitive he wouldn't have done it and that I was insulting his wisdom. Why pays for a meal and wants other people's trash dumped on their tray? In addition to tell me I am insulting him because I think he was uncouth is ridiculous. I paid for food not to be a bus boy. He told me he didn't care if I never ate there again and that's what I plan to do. I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"What an amazing family run business that serves no fuss food. They get brisk business and most people come in for takeouts. Both the chicken and the meat gyros are fresh, served on warm pita bread, daubed with tzatziki sauce and some interesting onion-tomato seasoning. The fries are hot and without any trace of staleness. The flaky, syrupy, nutty baklava is a must try- get it for take out, microwave it for 10 secs and enjoy the goodness!!!

Derek r. has compare the place to Spices but I feel it is difficult to compare uniqueness, love Niro's for its own reasons and the same goes for Spices."}
{"text":"First timer here! Went for lunch with the Hubs. Had a coupon that we got on our front door. SO GOOD!!!!!!!!! Quick service and great Gyros! Really tasty! We will definitely be back to try something else. They have a wide assortment of food there. They have a punch card for free stuff and you can get coupon via text message too."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today on my husband's insistence, Niro's has catered a few events at his work and he loves their gyro meat.  I've actually been to Greece and had a gyro there, it's been a few years but honestly I absolutely loved the gyro I had at Niro's today and it may have even surpassed the taste of the one I had in Greece.  The gyro was huge and pilled full of the delicious meat, I wanted to order another just because my mouth wanted more but one was actually very filling. The gyro sauce tasted like tzatziki but possibly made with sour cream instead of yogurt, it was really good.   I had a Greek side salad as well and it was great, so impressed that they actually make their own salad dressing. The restaurant itself is nothing fancy, perfect for lunch dining. I definitely want to go back and try the other sandwiches on the menu, including the chicken gyro, italian sausage and meat sandwiches but I loved the gyro so much that I'd hate to go back and not have one of those also, conundrum..."}
{"text":"Very good gyros sandwiches, salads, drinks in an informal atmosphere for lunch. Love the tzatziki.  The owners/managers are always so warm and welcoming. If you like the flavor of mediterranean, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Been Going Here For Over 4 Years This Is One One The Better Places I Been To Get A Gyro. This Time I Was Not A Great Visit  The Food Was Cold. I Understand It Was Lunch Time So The Most Likely Made A Lot Of Fries And Had The Meat Cut And Ready But Still Not A Great Visit. But Like I Said Before Been Going Here For Years And Will Go Back Not Gonna Let One Bad Visit Turn Me Away."}
{"text":"Not even close to Zorba's. Gyros are quite tasteless. Maybe it has deteriorated recently?"}
{"text":"This little hole-in-the-wall, located on the southwest corner of 48th Street at Elliot in Ahwatukee, serves the best gyros this side of the Atlantic.   What qualifies me to make such a resounding statement?  My husband and I have been to Greece several times and were married on the island of Corfu (in the Ionian Sea).  

If that isn't enough of an endorsement, our friends from Chicago also thought Niro's served the best Gyros -- and Chi-town has the largest congregration of Greeks (hence \"Greektown\") outside of Greece.

But it isn't just the gyros that rock, I love any of their fried food too -- Mozerella Sticks, Onion Rings, French Fries.   I don't know what kind of oil they use - but the taste is fantastic and they are fried to crispy perfection.

The facility itself is misleading and unimpressive.  If you can get over that, you'll find a tastey gyro winner.  Don't keep driving by - stop in!"}
{"text":"OK people, if you like Gyro's then you'll love Niro's.  They treat the meat with care and apply alot to their Pitas.  So much so you better get extra napkins and a fork!

Hot Juicy and tons of flavor, they also have Italian beef, Chicken and Greek salads too.  Great alternative to fast food, but they cater too."}
{"text":"I ordered the Italian beef sandwich, which was priced at $5.25. No fries or drink. I didn't realize it was actually rang up as $7.48 until I had already left. The beef was underseasoned, and I'm glad I got mine dipped because the meat was super dry. I make Italian beef at home sometimes and it's  hard to make the meat dry, so I don't what happened. 

No where in the ball park of the Italian beef you find in the Chicago area. Maybe their gyros are better, but I'm not going back to find out because that was not worth $7.48."}
{"text":"Just moving into the neighborhood , Niros caught my eye and I had to stop by this establishment and see how the food was. I tried the gyro plate and enjoyed my meal. I've had bigger gyros, but this gyro tasted great and will be going back for more.

You receive a good amount of fries with your gyro plate. The fries are pretty good too!

Besides gyros, there are several other sandwich options to choose from, philly's italian beef, hot dogs to name a few..

The inside decor isn't much, but I'll take good food at a place rather than nice decor/surroundings and bad food.

Want a good gyro, stop by Niros!

Looking forward to going back and trying other menu items."}
{"text":"Good food. HORRIBLE customer service. Came in for the first time 12/26/14 around 8 p.m. and got food TO GO and the cashier was absolutely terrible. I don't like to tip on my card I always leave cash when I tip and once the girl saw I didn't tip she treated me like a piece of garbage. The food is one thing but being in sales and customer service the experience means just as much to me. The fact that the guy next to me might have tipped her a buck or 2 when I had a $10 bill with her name on it the way she treated me I will never go back to this place. To have someone like this be the face of your resteraunt is a mistake and needs to be fixed."}
{"text":"The gyros here are amazing.  I always get extra tzatziki sauce and pitas, because there is SO MUCH meat.  For extra indulgence, get fries and put them ON the gyro.  Bliss."}
{"text":"The gyros...the best I've found around town!! Very generous with their meat portions.

I drive down from the biltmore area for lunch about once a month....I wish they (or me) was closer"}
{"text":"I was going to Zorba's to have gyros until I explored this place, and I'm regretful about the time which I wasted in Zorba's.

Niro's Gyros (on University Ave.) is a great place to have gyros. Fast and delicious!!! Also cheap. You pay less than 8$ for a value meal. Also, they have a deal when you get 2 gyro sandwiches, you can get 1 free!!!

Only disadvantage of the place is that they have no indoor area, because they work like a take-away.

Anyhow, this is the best gyros place in C-U area."}
{"text":"Love this place. Large portions, great taste, and friendly staff.  First tried Gyros in a little dive place in LaGrande, OR. Since then I am hooked. When we moved here we came across Niro's and had to stop. We were glad we did."}
{"text":"The gyro meat is perfect! I didn't realize how hard it was to get it right until I tried some other places and they were disgusting. Niro's gets it just right. They have good prices--made better by joining their email list for the weekly coupons (that's the only email they send, no flooding of your inbox). They always pack a lot of food, no skimping. Also, pretty fast service. Definitely 5 stars."}
{"text":"Never miss a chance to stop here when I'm in town.  Best sauce for gyros at ANY place I've ever eaten gyros.  Order extra!  Fries thick, but crispy."}
{"text":"This was my husbands and I first visit.  It was our date night and wanted to try something different.   I must say we made an excellent choice.  It was one of the best experiences we have had.  From the fast and friendly order taking to the delivery of our food.  If you haven't tried Niro's.... give it a shot!  You'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"I grew up on Chicago's Northwest side, I know a real Gyro. Niro's has Gyros like nobody's business. I've also had their Italian beef, also excellent. I just ate at the new Tempe location, and I am soooo glad I did. The Ahwautukee location is great but a bit further to go for me now.  Facilities are neat and clean at both locations as far as I've seen, and there is a 'midwest' kinda feel that the transplanted vagabond in me yearns for."}
{"text":"The fries were mushy but I guess you shouldn't go to a gyros place wanting good fries. Now the gyros on the other hand was pretty darn good"}
{"text":"This place is great. Good food, great taste and the owner, cashier was very friendly. 

Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This is a different Niros than the place I have eaten at in the past.  We ordered 5 gyro sandwiches and all five were different sizes with completely different amounts of tzatziki sauce, onions and tomatoes.  We also ordered two orders of french fries and both orders of French fries were filled differently.  I'm not talking about shifting french fries as we take our order home, I'm saying they filled both orders of french fries differently.  I hope the owner considers hiring employees that are willing to perform tasks a bit more consistently."}
{"text":"This place is great! I go often.
Tonight, the guy on duty treated me very well.
Their service gets them an extra star. The first three are for their convenient chicago dogs and Italian beef sandwiches. Not the best in the world, but 3 stars worth. 
Sorry, but the food and property has to stand out to me to complete a 5 star rating.

This place isn't pretty and the food isn't the best of its kind, but I really like that it is available when I want it. The location is convenient for me and there probably aren't many other providers of this type of food in the city."}
{"text":"Excellent place, great food, low prices, good team, great discounts. I do recommend it"}
{"text":"THE YELLOW.  THAT YELLOW SIGN THAT SHINES BRIGHT AND IS VISIBLE FOR MILES.  And by miles, I mean you can see it calling your name at 1:30AM from the beer garden at Station.  I haven't been back to Chambana since graduation and this is what I miss the most.  BBQ Gyros, Pizza Puffs, Gyro Burgers, free soda by the mouthful from the fountain.  This place could be open exclusively from 1-4AM and would still make a KILLING.  Even better, if you have a scavenger roommate that wants nothing more than an order of piping hot onion rings, he'll pick that shit up for you in zero-degree weather as long as you let him finish your pepsi."}
{"text":"The gyros here are really good. Don't expect it to be hot though! I asked for cucumbers on my gyro and the woman who owns it told me they don't have it on their line but when my friend ordered a salad, she got cucumbers. they charge too much for what u get and the owner seems as stingy as can be. 
One example... She gave my friend her bag of food and when she noticed that my friend had napkins in her hand, the owner reached into her bag and took those napkins out. 

The gyro meat is great but I'd MUCH rather go to haji baba n have a much better experience and pay less!"}
{"text":"Love Niro's! I have been coming here for years and have enjoyed it every time I come. They have really good food, tons of space to sit and relax, and the pricing is competitive with any other Greek cuisine place I have been. Everything is made fresh as well, so you always get fresh, hot food"}
{"text":"I used to get Gyro burger and pound of gyro meat from these guys. Very friendly and the food is also excellent. The pound of gyro meat is super cool considering its only $7."}
{"text":"Having grown up in Nafplion, Greece and lived in Tarpon Springs, Fl I wasnt expecting much to begin with. I tried the chicken gyro which left a lot to be desired. The chicken was rubbery and it looked like they carved it out like gyro meat. Had two pieces of tomato very few onions and some tzatziki sauce. Honestly the best thing about the meal was the fries. Price was higher than average for me.. Around $8 for the chicken gyro and fries no soda."}
{"text":"This place has great food.  Double giro protein plate is outstanding.  The chicken giro meat is the best I've had anywhere.  The beef dip sandwich, super thick with awesome jus.  AND REAL Chicago dogs.  Don't think twice, eat here."}
{"text":"Everything is incredible, including the service.  The best meal I've had to eat in Champaign or Urbana.  I even favor it over a  famous BBQ place in Urbana.  Huge extensive menu."}
{"text":"Looking for a good gyro joint nearby I was eager to try out niro's gyros, its been there for a while but I had just never gotten around to checking it out.  Well I guess I have only myself to blame for not checking it out earlier.  The gyros are quite good, and contain plenty of meat.  The gyros also pass the required 2-hour post consumption test (they don't wipe you out for the rest of the day :)).  Not the greatest gyro I've had, but a very tasty gyro, and eager to have again.

Niro also serves other chicago style fare (italian beef, hot dogs, etc.) and its good to see the owners behind the counter; quality restaurant.  Catering is also offered."}
{"text":"Interesting decore in this place! Bright green and yellow walls, chairs and tables. Went here for lunch and the place was very clean. I ordered the Italian beef sandwich and my wife got the  gyro. Both were overfilled with meat and tasted fantastic! Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The gyro I had was pretty good. Though the meat was a bit dry, the sauce helped. Flavorful. My mom and I shared the Greek fries, and they were ok at best. I wish we hadn't had gotten it- after ordering, I noticed a bag of frozen fries in the kitchen- that must explain the taste of old french fries. The mozzarella sticks were ok too, but they also seemed to be frozen. 

The cashier was nice, though. I forget her name, but she was nice and did everything correctly in my eyes."}
{"text":"Great portions, fast service and best of all the staff and owners are always friendly! I like their chicken options because I tend to stray away from lamb. My coworkers and I eat there once a week!"}
{"text":"I am udderly shocked by how poor the service is. I ordered food tonight at 7:15. It is now 10:23 and I still have not received it. I called after an hour and a half and they said my food was next to go out. Then they called me at 9:49 and said it would be leaving in the next 10 minutes. I live 3.1 miles from this place. Even if this is the best food I have ever had, I will never order from this place again. I have worked in restaurants forever and I am VERY understanding as to the things that can happen, but over 3 hours for a cheeseburger and fries and some cheese sticks is no where near the realm of acceptable. Don't patronize this restaurant, they clearly do not care about their customers. I wish I would have read the other Yelp reviews before ordering as there are several similar stories."}
{"text":"So I finally got my boyfriend to try a gyro...and boy was he impressed! Niro's has delicious food and a good old traditional feel. The gyro was overloaded with meat and the tzatziki sauce was probably the best I've ever had. If you're in the area definitely stop by for a taste, you will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Let's make one thing clear: this is the only decent gyro in 100 miles.  I tried Zorba's in 1985 long before Niro's opened up.  They were overpriced & worse yet, they sucked.

Niro's west, as well as the one on University Avenue, satisfy this native Chicagoan's need for traditional \"Vienna Beef\" restaurant fare.

Gyros: great; sliced off the gyro & grilled up just so
Tzatziki sauce: great as homemade
Pitas: great & grilled to perfection
Polish sausages: great
Fries: great; order well-done if you like crispiness outside, soft inside
Service: great

The best kicker of all, BUY 2 get 1 FREE after 4 p.m. everyday on West Springfield Avenue.

Don't try to eat this stuf everyday, but boy I could!"}
{"text":"My lady and I finally got around to eating here and did it disappoint.  I ordered the Italian Beef Sandwich, she an Artichoke Chicken Pita Sandwich.

First, the meat in my Italian Beef was bland, really bland.  I was sprinkling salt on my sandwich.  I can't remember any time I ever sprinkled salt on anything, after it was prepared.

I opted for hot peppers over the sweet (Actually, I asked for hot & sweet but he said it'd cost more for both.  Yeesh.).  I didn't see or taste any.

I asked for the sandwich to be dipped but I was expecting, y'know, an actual roll.  The 'bread' must've been like those premium hot dog buns that Costco sells because it just mushed up, completely.  That's probably what bummed me out the most because when your teeth just break the barely crusty exterior of that roll and the au jus bursts from the inside, that's what you get Italian Beefs for.  Just mush at Niro's.

I just asked my lady what she thought of her sandwich, \"It was plain and didn't fill me up.\"  Now, my girlfriend isn't the hearty eater that I am.  She's pretty slim and rarely finishes anything.  She's also allergic to onions so is used to having food that has no flavor (Heehee).  For her to say those things, it's bad.

We shared a side of fries and they were good, though. Not great.

We won't be visiting Niro's again.  I recommend Chizona's Pizza for a good Italian Beef, if you're in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Great gyros.  Great onion rings (w/ ranch of course!).  A tiny bit pricey, but worth every penny.  Go for the gyro and you will never feel disappointed (or ill)."}
{"text":"This is the worst place I have ever tried I swear I think I seen a roach crawling on the wall it is disgusting the food is nasty the guy world that I tried smell sour when I open the container and I was not pleased at all this is probably the worst place you could ever try I would suggest you never go there"}
{"text":"Good place for a gyro sandwich.  The service is friendly, fast and the decor was old but clean.  

I had the single gyro combo.  Some of the best fries I've had in the valley.  It was around $8 for lunch.  The tomatoes were fresh and tasty pita bread was fresh.  

Didn't try the baklava.  They had a display though and it was dripping with honey and looked delicious."}
{"text":"we had the double gyros platter and a greek salad.  the meat could have been seasoned a little better but overall it was not bad for the price. Their cucumber sauce is excellent as are the fries.  The service was quick and friendly.  The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because the AC was muggy and the place had that \"old restaurant smell\" like pinesol and grease :/"}
{"text":"I gave 5 stars because:

1. It has great Gyro. I used to go to Zorba's for Gyros, but I think this Niro's does a better job.

2. The have a deal for a free Gyro with the purchase of two Gyro meals. 

3. Did I mention the Gyro is awesome?!

4. They are open pretty late in the night. That singlehandedly deserves one star! It's close to my lab, so it's a savior for late night work.

5. The people working there are friendly, and fellow students. 

Oh, and the Gyro is tasty!"}
{"text":"Great little place for lunch.
Tasty gyros, affordable, quick service and generous portions.

The chicken and artichoke pita is amazing.
 
Have no tried their Italian beef or Chicago dogs yet"}
{"text":"This actually happened a while ago,  but I just drove by the sign and remembered how irritated I was with my last experience here. I called in an order and asked for a gyro with hummus instead of tzatziki. The nice girl on the phone said \"oh okay... sure!\" When I came in to pick it up, the owner was over her shoulder at the register and saw that she hadn't up-charged me for the substitution. He proceeded to aggressively scold her in front of me, ending with, \"and now YOU get to tell her it costs more.\" That's totally fine, I have no problem with the up-charge. What I do have a problem with is the terrible way he treated his employee, and total lack of discretion. Not that it would have been excusable to talk to anyone like that in private either. I'll never go back and support his business, that's not how you should treat your employees, or anyone for that matter."}
{"text":"Would've been 5 stars if the Au Jus for the Italian Beef wasn't so spicy! First of all, Au Jus is French, not Italian, but a good Chicago style Italian Beef should have juice. Au Jus means \"it's own juice\", so it's the juice from the roast beef. Making it spicy doesn't make sense. If I want it spicy, I can add the spice, but if I want it mild, I can't take the spice away."}
{"text":"I gotta tell you. This place is so overrated first of all if you've ever had an authentic Gyro the meat is not supposed to be chopped up , there's is . It should be a shaved piece of meat 1 to 3\" long the tomatoes should be red.  Not green like theirs  and cut in quarters. Not slices the tdziki sauce had no flavor tasted like watered down ranch the onions should be crisp not mushy    The pita was good .Go to NY or Philly,Try one there let me know you folks will never dive a 5 star here again"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit.  Will definitely be back.  Fast & Friendly service (have to admit I liked that he called me \"miss\")  :)

Of course I had to get one of the traditional Gryo's. You can't judge a Gyro place if you don't try their gryo.

It was not too big & it was not too small.  So in my opinion that makes it JUST RIGHT.

It was very good! The meat was very tender and had lots of flavor. It comes with tomatoes, onions and (yummy) sauce.  The bread was excellent! So fresh and warm.  I should have ordered some extra to go along with some extra sauce....  next time.

I also tried the chicken, artichoke & roasted red peppers with sauce.  Wow was that ever flavorful!  That particular combo really allows each ingredient to stand out.  Again the toasted bread is outstanding!

There were quite a few people in there for lunch on a week day & every one of them looked happy and enjoying their lunch!  

Oh yeah, we'll come back here.  Next time I'll be sure to take some extra menus and let me friends know about this place the next time they are planning a trip to Tempe!"}
{"text":"The food has gone down hill. The pitas are soggy and so are the fries. I really liked this place and am disappointed in the changes."}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch spot in Ahwatukee. The gyro meat is always fresh, the tzaziki is tasty, pitas are toasted. Basically a perfect gyro sandwich. And even the \"single gyro\" is huge. I'm not sure how people order double and triple orders. My friends also like the chicken artichoke pita, though I'm not a huge fan of chicken gyro meat in general. The service is always really friendly and the food is very reasonable priced. My only complaint would be about the decor - faded posters showing gyros and hot dogs really don't do it for my appetite. Luckily the food is so good I can ignore the visuals."}
{"text":"I went here last week in a Tuesday 
Fairly empty at 6 pm
Service was quick to take our orders and have food out
We got the chicken gyro and Greek salad
For me it was different than I was used too
I am used to gyro having feta and lettuce on it and really flavorful taziki sauce
Food was okay but for me not a keep coming back to"}
{"text":"More expensive for lower quality gyros pita sandwich and salad than others in the area. Feta on gyro is $0.92 extra which isn't too uncommon but free down the street at King where the salad is better and gyros slices much larger. 

Dr. Pepper is really good here."}
{"text":"I ordered and paid online but the cashier is telling ME I have to pay. Uh no. No apology or anything. Rude and unprofessional hmmmm"}
{"text":"I found this place due to Yelp. While we have been to the Phoenix metro area many times having lived in Tucson for many years, we recently moved to Chandler and don't know all of the great places to eat yet.

I was in the area running some errands and brought Yelp up on my Iphone to find a decent gyro.  

Ordered 2 of their basic gyros to go and went back to my office.  Not only did I really enjoy it, all of my co-workers asked where I went and said that they smelled amazing. If I would have been a nice guy, I should have shared, but I was hungry. :-)

Niro's will become a regular stop on our lunch circuit.  I am looking forward to trying some of the other items on their menu."}
{"text":"I don't usually review chains, but since this is the only place in Champana you can get a descent gyros, I'll make an exception.

Their gyros aren't amazing or anything, but will definitely quench that gyros craving. Yes, they are greasy, but all good gyros are -- I like mine with giardiniera. However, it is important to mention that I've had their Italian beef before and it was crappy! 

I'll definitely be back to Niro's whenever I'm in the mood for a greasy gyros."}
{"text":"I was in the 'hood and hungry. After a quick yelp search this was the highest rated restaurant in my 'current location' so I decided to give it a try. I had the chicken pita which was delicious. 

Service was friendly and fast. If I'm ever in the neighborhood again I might go back."}
{"text":"I never tried a hot dog from here so I can't really comment on the previous author's review.  The fries are greasy, but aren't they suppose to be?

However, I have eaten gyros here... about 25 times in the past 6 months.  I get the chicken gyros which are excellent.  The tzatziki sauce is awesome and the pitas are overstuffed with the meat, onions, and tomatoes.  

If you have a craving for gyros, I implore you to try this place.  To top it off it is family owned so you won't be stuffing money into some corporate fat cat."}
{"text":"So, after have passed this place hundreds of times going to Safeway, I tried it. Granted it wasn't even my idea - but I tried it just the same. Once inside I realized that my expectations were correct and the options were limited. I usually do not think this is a bad thing, since I rather have an establishment do something well and only serve that than going big and doing a half-assed job.
 
I had the gyro, low-carb version which is basically a gyro but no bread. I cannot have bread at this time, so I had to go that route. In a styrofoam box I got meat, salad, onion and tomato - and on the side some tzatziki. 

I was not blown away. The meat is ok, even if it isn't what I was hoping - at least it was what I was expecting. The salad was fresh enough, but so few ingredients. It might be something they gradually have cut down on just to save money, I do not know. Since there is an option to double the meat I cannot get disappointing on the portion. Absolutely ok for lunch. 

But the biggest disappointment was the tzatziki. I mean, yogurt sauce in all honor but there is no shame in flavor and that flavor should be garlic. I tasted no garlic, and I tasted not much of anything but a saucy yogurt sauce. I wanted this to be the highlight and it wasn't. I can see myself going back.. but now I know what to expect. 

It is a family owned business, so I give them all props. We need this."}
{"text":"Yummy food. Meat is tender and delicious. But one thing that annoyed us was when we wanted more tomato for our sandwich they charged us more for a couple of slices. Fries are good and fresh."}
{"text":"I'm on my way home from being stuck in traffic and realized it was too late to cook. I've had Niros awesome Gyros but hadn't tried their burgers yet. Wow! They're fantastic and almost more than my son could eat! Great people too!!!"}
{"text":"I really do love this place, not just because of the food but because of the kind hearted Husband and Wife Greek owners who always make you feel at home. All the food is reasonably priced and well portioned. My favorites are the Gyros which are traditionally dressed tomatoes, onions and Tzatziki (Greek) sauce. For those of you who don't like lamb the Chicken Pita's are legit too. This place has comfort food favorites like Philly Cheese Sandwiches and Chicago Dogs. Don't forget to get the homemade Baklava on your way out! The D√©cor here is a little out of date but you won't notice it once you start eating. I almost forgot... The fries are ALWAYS hot!"}
{"text":"I ate here the other day and thought it was great, I will definitely be going back.  From the other reviews maybe I'm biased since I'm a guy. I had a chicken pita and tried my friends gyro and thought they were both very good.  I didn't find the fries were overly greasy since the little paper sack they came in soaked up some of the oil. I even really liked the fake cheese sauce that came with the cheese fries ( sue me! ). I found the interior very clean for a small \"greasy spoon\" not as dumpy as you would think.  The staff was very nice and my food came out lightning fast.  For a quick lunch I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Low quality Gyro. Practically thrown together in literally 3 min. I asked politely for cooked grilled peppers and onions she charged me an extra buck. They did not dice or cook them at all. No shears ever heard. Their meat is microwaved BS. The meal cost me 13.27 I got a drink a fry a gyro and Chicago dog. the fry was not well done when had specifically asked.... When I got the thrown together meal. I asked for a side of Ranch and the register girl goes into sales mode. This was not a very good meal. Not happy with their customer philosophy. Your going to nickel and dime some one that just ordered a 13.27 value, and assured them I will never be back and you should think twice before going to this frugal gyro joint. Sh**thole"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  If you like swanky trendy decor over great food that does not skimp on the portions then this might not be your place but if you want your tummy and your wallet happy don't mis it."}
{"text":"This is the first restaurant that I ate at on Champaign that I've liked. I had a gyro with fries and it was really in expensive. The gyro meat was fantastic, thinly sliced, and not greasy. The yogurt sauce was good, but like most gyros I've had, I wish there were more tomatoes."}
{"text":"I just spent 10 minutes of my life in the drive through!! There was 1car in front of me that obviously ordered everything. I ordered 1 regular gyro and I have no idea how it taste because after 10 minutes I put my car in reverse and left.  I saw a worker and manager worry more about getting the right to go containers out of their storage building that worry about the customers. They need to learn that time is money."}
{"text":"Yum!  Had the gyro meal and it was delicious!  Lots of meat and perfect amount of sauce.  I love that you can make it a meal by adding fries and a soda.  The fries are those big thick steak fries and my mouth watered just thinking about them again :)

The place was clean and busy which is always a good sign.  We're glad we found an awesome Gyro joint not far from home.  We'll definately go here often.

Lots of selection on the menu, you can even get the gyro \"diet\" version where they leave the pita out, if that's your sorta thing."}
{"text":"Great food but with no cars ahead of me the wait in the drive thru was so long I had to leave without my food!"}
{"text":"I ate the chicken picado pita. It was spicy and delicious. Friendly people and great food. I would recommend this restaurant to a friend."}
{"text":"Just ate here, and all I can say is I'm very impressed. I like dessert just as much as the next person, but your DINNER is dessert here. Lol. 

I had the Single Gyro, and I could taste the quality immediately. Tender meat. Nicely warmed and soft pita. Sounds simpler than it does, but there is an art to making things this good. Owner was here when I came in to eat (how often do you see that?!\"), and the pride of ownership shows in the food. 

Besides the food being beyond great, the place was clean, and the service was fast. Everything they advertise, they back up here. If you are in the Ahwatukee area, and you need something affordable and quick, this spot has you covered. :)"}
{"text":"We have driven by this restaurant & have seen the billboards that we finally decided to stop in. I guess that I should have gotten my expectations in order before going in.

I'm basing the number of stars I have given on the quality of the food. We ordered the double order of gyros .. Half regular & half chicken. It came with 2 large portions of meat, onions, tomatoes, & gyro sauce. By far, the best thing on the plate was the gyro sauce. The chicken was dry & tasted weird. I personally thought that the regular gyro was a little bit better but not by much. Additionally, as a side, we upgraded to the Greek fries, which was a mistake. The fries themselves were good (especially with the gyro sauce) but for $1.25 extra, it was not worth it for the little big of feta cheese sprinkled on top & a lemon wedge.

I will say that for the amount of money that we paid, the quantity was large. There are quite a few other Mediterranean places in town that I would prefer over this for the quality, however."}
{"text":"I stopped in to give it a try.  So glad I did.  Walked in to the place.  Looked a little dated and divey but in a way that you know dives are sometimes the best places.  Nicest lady at the counter greeted me and recommended the gyro.  She looked honest so I took her up on it with a side Greek salad.  Oh my god was that the best gyro I have ever had.  I work in the area and have never been here but will definitely be going back.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Way too long of a wait in the drive through. Then when I informed the man working he had forgotten part of my order he tried to argue with me as though I can't see what is in my bag. Got baklava and it was more like pizza than baklava? So that made no sense."}
{"text":"Excellent gyros and fries. Good prices. Friendly service. Clean. Has a drive through if you're on the go."}
{"text":"What to make of Niro's . . . 

As an AZ Chicagoan transplant, their Chicago style leave a lot for me to desire.  Their Italian beef is not one I'd order again.  Their Maxwell Street polish is decent though.  

Their burger . . . umm, no comment.

I have found a nice bright spot on their menu, and that's their Greek Salad with Gyro meat.  I have issues with it, because along with the lettuce it came with only maybe 6 cucumber slices, 4 olives, 2 rings of red onion.   It DID come with a TON of gyro meat though.

No place I'd go out of the way for, but if you work/live in the area, it's ok"}
{"text":"I have been going to Niro's for several years.  You can always count on them fulfilling your your order very quickly and with consistently good quality.

When I am in a hurry between meetings I can count on Niro's to deliver a better experience than I could get at a random fast food joint.

The gyros are good, the french fries are hot and crisp and the service is always friendly."}
{"text":"O.m.g. why haven't we come here sooner? Food was amazing. Definitely satisfied the Chicago craving. We haven't had good gyros since we lived there. If you're from Chicago area, you'll be impressed with how clean it is compared to most other gyro joints. The guy at the front counter (owner I'm assuming) was SO friendly. Bonus points for great music (classic rock station) We'll be back. Like next weekend."}
{"text":"Love the Gyro. When on a diet you can ask for the salad with gyro meat, will full you up! I also love than every time I go, the owners are there, I like supporting local business, specially when they have the best Gyros in town!"}
{"text":"Always excellent, fast service. The food is amazing. They are Chicago style, and I come here with friends from Chicago. They don't disappoint! From gyros to fries to hot dogs, I highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Good Stuff - I got the Italian Beef Combo with Hot peppers and a side gravy .. less than 9 bucks .. used CC ... was great!"}
{"text":"Food is average - gyro meat is kind of bland....I find it odd that they put the gyro sauce ON the hot gyro and by the time you get home it is all melted and has oozed out of the sandwich.  They are pretty skimpy with the one slice of tomato cut in half and five or six onion strings they put under the meat.  Service is either very good or way below average.  Salads are pretty good.  Overall menu is a bit (not terrible) pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Delicious! This is the best gyro place in the C-U and the best gyro place ever. The quality of the food is amazing. The portions are generous and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"The best Gyros, this side of the Mediterranean! Been coming here for a decade and I've never been disappointed. The owners are always there, taking orders, cooking the food and making sure the place is clean and runs smooth. 2 thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Niros!!! Where to start? This place is the best place on the planet. I have never had a bad experience from Niros and iv'e been coming here for about 15 years! Every single item on their menu is fantastic. The lunch specials are awesome. 2 burgers fries and a drink for like 5 bucks? U cant beat that. And its like the best burgers in town. The gyro burger dressed as a gyro is my personal favorite. Mozz sticks, pizza puffs, crispy fries. They have so many different food options. gyros, italian beef, italian sausage, burgers, shrimp, ribeye steak sandwiches.. The list goes on and on.  I would fight and die for niros."}
{"text":"Food was very good and fresh. Had the chicken picado pita but didn't realize it came with jalapenos and wasn't expecting that on a gyro. The fries were good and hot. My son didn't care for the chicken tenders. My friend had single gyro and he's had to please with specialty food and he was quite impressed. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Good gyro and friendly service clean and fun atpmsphere, will be back"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch on a recommendation. Italian beef was dry, aus jus had no flavor, the hot dog was drenched in mustard to the point it was oozing through the bun. The fries were good."}
{"text":"It has a large array of foods to choose from, so if you don't want a gyro that day, you can find something else.  The fries are ok -- they used to serve a lot more than they do now -- but opt for the onion rings."}
{"text":"I have visited Niro's twice and each time I ordered two regular Gyros,  The problem is the amount of  cucumber sauce that the apply to the gyros..........very little...When I asked for more sauce I was told there would be and extra cost.  Real turn off when they hardly put any sauce on to begin with.  It's amazing how a small business would skimp on providing a little more sauce then risk bad reviews.  I would not recommend this place to Gyro lovers."}
{"text":"Huge gyro portions that easily spread to double the number of pitas.  You can purchase more pitas from them if you'd like, or just pick up some from the store in advance and save some money,

Great deal if you pick up the triple gyro plate, especially with the $2 off coupon. Love their fries as well. 

Italian beef is so so but the combo sausage has a nicely spiced kick to it. $0.49 for giardiniera which is only so so. My opinion, no one should charge extra for hot peppers. Get it dipped for true messy style."}
{"text":"I have not been to this place in years.. From what I remember I didn't care for the food. So today was the day I gave this place another try. 
First, the prices were perfect for me since I am a poor college student. I ordered the single gyro... By far the best gyro I have ever had. Because of the price I was worried it would not be enough food for me.. so I also ordered the Italian beef. I have to say that sandwich was HUGE for six bucks. The only problem I had with any of my food was the beef in the Italian beef, it was dry and bland. Because I had already had enough food from the gyro, I did not mind. I will absolutely be back soon for more food.. I am excited to try the Philly Steak, and the Hot Dog. Maybe tomorrow."}
{"text":"This is Greek food as I know it.  The kind that makes paper translucent, takes the edge off an upcoming hangover, and makes you feel crappy and satisfied simultaneously.  It's abundant in Chicago, but this is the best place in Chambana for a really greasy gyro.

They have the requisite gyros and Chicago hot dogs here, but I recommend the equally staple pizza puff and the OMFG-YES gyro burger.  Think of a quarter pound cheeseburger with layers of gyro meat strips on it...makes me want to pound a few and take a cab all the way to Urbana.

Oh, and the Urbana location is the original and a lot smaller than the Champaign one.  If you want your food quickly (or via drive-through) and want to avoid a mass of drunks late at night, go here."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Fantastic serving sizes! And fantastic service! Great value for money! Love the location! Five stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Our office found this on Yelp today and popped over for a quick lunch.  The owner was at the register and named the Gyro, Italian Beef and Philly Steak as their top choices.

We all were craving gyros and got the Gyro Meal.  French Fries were crispy and fluffy and the onion rings were the right kind of greasy and crunchy.

The gyros were fantastic.  Among the best any of us have ever had.  Lots of real meat, just enough sauce and a little messy.

We took a menu back and will be returning soon.

Service, Cleanliness, Quantity & Quality all earned top marks!"}
{"text":"It's pretty descent cheaper than Pita Jungle too. I will definitely come back again. I didn't give it more stars because the place is out dated. But it's definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"I've lived in Arizona 6 yrs and never seen the Grand Canyon... that being said, I've lived in this neighborhood for 9 mos and never experienced Niro's Gyros. The building looks humble enough. Very clean. Very cute inside. I guess they've been here for years. The tables inside are laminated with business cards painted on them of local area businesses. Bet they're glad they chose that form of advertising, good ROI. I've heard this place stays VERY busy. Glad I came during a quiet time. So peaceful. The Little One at the counter was darling. She looks you in the eye and holds intelligent conversation. It's great to see that much postive vibe come forth from our youth, Our Future... My friend's Gyro and greek salad looked amazing (wouldn't give me a bite, though). I ordered a Chicken Sandwich, no side -sub Baklava. The dessert was very sweet and sticky, best served cold, but seems the layers were little dry- not right kind of flakiness. Chicken- AMAZING! All fresh ingredients. Both meals a feast. I recommend to all!!
Next stop: Perhaps, The Grand Canyon!"}
{"text":"Thought I'd give it a try. Place is very blah...Ordered gyro meal, came with fries and a drink. I like the fries-not fat-medium-gyro had onion, tomato and a bland tzatziki. Meat was fair not the best, not the worst. Very fast and friendly service. Boasts of Chicago style eats..."}
{"text":"Awesome Gyros, lots of flavor. Fries were nice and golden. Comming back for more!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Niro's for over 5+ years.  I think the gyro is really good.  Being from Chicago, we love our gyro so I'm glad this place is near my home.   If you get the double gyro plate, they give you a lot of meat.  Just wish they would give you 4 pitas since 2 is not enough."}
{"text":"Finally, a place that will serve you a great, old-school char-broiled cheeseburger in this town!"}
{"text":"I ordered around 9 at night and waited about an hour and a half for my food. I called to check the status and she rudely said it was on its way. I called again and she said they still have to send it out and when I tried talking further, the lady answering calls hung up on me. The service is awful for food that is okay."}
{"text":"First visit was very enjoyable. The gyro meat was notably less greasy than other Greek joints I've been to. The gyro sandwich itself was great - nice toasted pita, fresh tomatoes and onions, plenty of meat, and the sauce was nicely buried inside. Was so good grabbed a second one! Knocked one star off for pedestrian fries but added it back for helpful staff and very relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":".....so the owner came out as we were finishing up and apologized for his attitude. He said he was stressed out. It was a nice gesture and I appreciated it. The rest of the review, and the upgrade from one star to two, honestly goes like this...

Food: 2.5 out of 5. The gyro was good, comparable to other good places. Fries were hot and seemed fresh, but not plentiful. The hummus was truly the worst I've ever tasted, it was actually bad,...and I'm a tolerant eater. It was bland and sour, too cold and thick and pasty.

Atmosphere: 2 out of 5. Colorful, but dirty. You eat on carpet. Carpet in a dining room? It's dirty. Tables and chairs are old and not terribly comfortable.

Service: Girl at the front was sweet, but completely uneducated about the menu. Owner, we covered that.

Pricing: Not great. Pretty expensive for the quantity and quality.

Would I go back? Nope. There are other gyro/Mediterranean options in the area."}
{"text":"Definitely reminded me of home (Chicago).

I love these mom and pop stores, especially ones that have been around over 10 years.  Pricing is reasonable, food is decent and well portioned, and though its greasy and bad for you, sometimes you just gotta.  

The gyro was worth it for me.  The chicken picado wasn't very good and though we thought it might be a healthy choice it was greasier than the gyro and had too much jalapeno on it.  Fries are average."}
{"text":"Looked for a decent gyro place & decided to give them a whirl. So glad that I finally stopped by to get some yummy gyro! Plenty of gyro meat & sauce which is great. Most place skimp on both. Place is small, but quaint. Quick & friendly service. I will definitely go back for more especially since the fries are not the skinny cut fries. Prices are reasonable & family friendly too!!"}
{"text":"The place is called Niro's Gyros so let's rate them on that:
A+ gyros.
The Italian beef is a C.
So do yourself a favor and order the gyros and fries."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmm! Amazing value!  So much meat you can get am extra pita and split the meat for 2."}
{"text":"I haven't had a gyro in years. Wanted something different tonight and I must say. Great choice. 
Just had the sandwich, no meal. Sandwich was  excellent. Service was good. Very friendly. Will definitely return to this location."}
{"text":"I don't like gyros. Their steak Philly steak sandwiches are awesome though! Guaranteed good time!"}
{"text":"I had the greek chicken salad and the chicken was tough. I would like to go back and try other items."}
{"text":"My sweetheart was working, so I found myself alone on a Saturday.  Woohoo!  After laying around the townhouse most of the morning, I decided to take a drive to get something to eat and shop at Costco in Tempe.  For a year or so I've wanted to try out Niro's Gyros at the southwest corner of 48th Street at Elliot in Ahwatukee.

The restaurant is located in a stand-alone building that must have been built and then abandoned by Pizza Hut.  No matter, once inside it is clean, with brightly colored tables and chairs. The front counter is gleaming white tile.  

I ordered a double gyro plate, which includes \"two toasted pitas served with a mountain of gyro meat with gyro sauce, tomatoes, onions, and fries on the side.\" After adding a large soda and hand over $12.71, I only had to wait five minutes for my number to be called.  

This is a casual eating establishment (i.e. plastic forks), so the gyro meat comes packaged within a white styrofoam container wrapped separate in white paper with the hot pitas and fries on the side.  There is enough meat to  overfill both pitas.  I found the whole meal very tasty and enjoyable."}
{"text":"I would call this average and basic Greek food.  For example I had the Greek salad with grilled chicken.  The grilled chicken was not super fresh and did not have much seasoning in it.  The hummus was above average and the pita bread was good, however we ordered Gyro chicken meat on the side as well and this was the processed meat rather than the strips of brown meat which higher classed Greek places offer."}
{"text":"From a veg point of view this place was a total flop. The online menu shows a fish sandwich, however in store the menu item was missing.

Unlike you usually Greek esque place, there is no falafel. I resorted to hummus $2.95 and for that price it does not include any pita, so I was forced to order a peta for $.90

The hummus came in a small Styrofoam cup not worth the $3 and the pita was soft and warm but again worth nearly a $1 I think not.

Most of the menu is beef gyros, gyro meat plats or gyro sandwiches.

There are a few salads on the menu but I am not a salad person.

I think I miss the pizza hut that used to occupy this location"}
{"text":"Fake awful \"Chicago style\" dog.

Wrong bun. No vienna beef. No celery salt. Toasted bun (wtf?)
 I feel sorry for people who think this is legit."}
{"text":"I needed a Greek place that had more seating than the BFG Express on Warner; long story - it was a birthday thing :)

So we settled on Niro's (handpicked by moi, willing to try something new, and good ratings on Yelp) ... it wasn't half bad.  I had the Gyro Salad, but wished I had the Gyro plate others had enjoyed.  It just really looked good.  The price is great, too.

The owner introduced herself, and upon learning we were celebrating a birthday, graciously offered a few pieces of her baklava - heck no I didn't share.

So, if you've cruised by thinking about it - give it a try :)"}
{"text":".got the regular gyro, Chicago style hotdog, and the gyro salad. Service was great and food was good. The atmosphere was really cool as well."}
{"text":"Finally made it here. I had the Greek salad with gyro meat. It was delicious. The meat isn't greasy. The girl up front was very nice and helpful. The bathrooms were super clean and I appreciate it. Their dressing was homemade and they put it on the side which I greatly appreciated. My daughter who hates eating out said she liked it so that's a vote of confidence. We will be back."}
{"text":"They have fast service even during rush hour and their food is consistently good. They're closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"5 stars since the combination of value for money and food quality cannot be matched. The gyros are GREAT and by themselves would be rated 4 stars. But, add the great location and price...this warranted the max rating. 

Tired after work and need a quick satisfying inexpensive take out meal? Few places will do better than Niro's Gyros."}
{"text":"i got a giant fucking burger. The beef and grilled onions were really good, but the whole thing was super salty. Saltier than the fries. The pickles are a waste. Zero flavor. The worst is the awkward silence between the terrible country/90s rock. Get a tv or a fish tank or something!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered from here tonight. I ordered a gyro burger, and waited about an hour and a half for my food to be delivered. Once I finally got the chance to unwrap my burger, I realized it was a regular burger. I then called Niro's back and they refused to send my correct order back to me. It took several calls for them to agree to send out my correct order tonight. During this process, they were very rude, stopped answering my phone calls, and refused to accept responsibility for their own mistake. It's a shame because I think their food is good."}
{"text":"I love Niro's - it's comfort food for a native easterner.  The service is quick and courteous and the Gyro combo really hits the spot.  Yum."}
{"text":"Very disappointing... ordered beef sandwich and it was sliced too thick plus bread just fell apart as you at it .  Will not go back!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine took me here for lunch. Amazing! Great price, gyros was delicious! I am definitely  recommending this place. Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Great gyros, and that is all I will order here. The gyros meat is very good, and they don't skimp on the tzatziki, which is more flavorful than other restaurants in the area, like Zorbas. We used to have Niro's Gyros in Arizona, so I was happy to see multiple locations here. Their customer service could use a lot of work (rude and forgetful), and this is a smaller location, best for takeout/drive-thru."}
{"text":"Niro's Gyros is located in the Safeway Shopping Plaza.  Niro's is a small family owned Greek and Chicago style eatery. Their hallmark is the Gyro meat which is not greasy like you find in many places.  Niro's even makes their own house tzatziki sauce which is pretty tasty and the sandwiches are very large in fact their sandwiches are large enough for two.

Niro's must be a local favorite from the looks of the  line at lunch however, the service is fast and friendly.
The prices at Niro's are very competitive.  In fact, the average lunch costs less than what you would pay at many fast food chains. 

Good service, compare prices, and tasty food. Give this place a try if you're ever in the area."}
{"text":"Great food! Seriously, really good stuff.  Burgers to gyros to grilled cheese. Finally this corner comes to life. Don't let this one close!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I used to live right by Niro's and go there on a bi-weekly basis.  I still pop by when I am in the area and have a hankering for some Greek food.

I will admit, I've had better gyros before.  However, Niro's gyros do pass muster and solidly qualify as good and rather nicely sized.  I just wish it was a bit less price wise as some of the other places where I have had gyros have had similar quality for not so much.

The restaurant itself isn't swanky but it's nice for what it is..a family owned Greek joint.  The staff is also usually quite nice. 

Overall, I'm not sure I'd suggest crossing the Valley to try it out, but if you're in the general area and have a bit of a jonesing for Greek eats, I'd suggest checking it out at least once."}
{"text":"Probably more of a 3 1/2 but it's close to a 4 so what the hell.  Tasty 2 gyro plate with fries, it's a make your own plate basically.  The young girl at the counter was very friendly and the food came up fast for take out.  I thought the gyro meat was very good, maybe a little overly salty but it's heavy fast foodish food so it's not the end of the world.  The restaurant itself is clean, nothing special but does the trick.  Will go back."}
{"text":"Gyros and french fries and dietcoke are o outstanding a few people told me this is the best gyro in phx and I want to confirm it"}
{"text":"Very low key fast food like kind of place... Flexible for low carb customers. Serena was our cashier, I thought she was not going to be very nice (I know, wrong first impressions) but she was actually very nice and friendly... she gave us recommendations and helped us decide. 
Hubby had the double gyro with fries, and I had the diet plate or something like that (gyro with lettuce, tomatoes, onions... no fries, no pita). For this they gave us 3 yogurt sauce containers and, oh my, that yogurt gyro sauce is delicious... I could eat it by itself with a spoon... I think I loved it because it was not very 'Dill'ish... 
This is far from home but if we are in the neighborhood we will certainly stop here."}
{"text":"Was never a fan of gyros growing up, the last one I ever remember tasted gross.  Now as an adult my tastebuds are different and when I tried a gyro at this place, I was excited to find a new love - Gyros!

This is the only place I have ever tried them and I thought the one in 48th street was better. Up until the other day when I ordered one and this tasted even better.  This place is pretty quick with your order, it is quiet and laid back.  They make the best gyros I had so far. 


If you are a first time eater of a gyro, I recommended this place! Huge pile of meat in your gyro!"}
{"text":"Their gyro is the only gyro I tried in my lifetime, so I'm not in a best position to talk about it.

What I usually have when I visit this place is the half-pound burger meal. (plain, cheese, chilli cheese) Considering its price, the taste is surprisingly good. The patty is juicy enough and the fries are (almost always) like just fried. They rarely make mistakes in preparing the foods, which is the virtue that many restaurants in this town lack.

One star was deducted because their service is not the best, and the tables are small."}
{"text":"I used to love this place as a student, and looked forward to my visits when I was back in town, but on my recent trip I was somewhat disappointed.  The quality and taste were down significantly from what i had been accustomed to.  Perhaps I caught them on a bad day, so if I try it again and it's back to its old form I'll update this."}
{"text":"Great Value, Great Gyros, Great Service!

After years of driving right by here I had never noticed this little spot to fill my belly. We stopped in for a quick bite to eat and I'm glad we did. 

$6 Gyro sandwiches are difficult to be beat especially when they are this tasty and packed with meat. They give you a good value for the price here. 

The service was super friendly and family like. Everything was clean and good and I will definitely be back here to fill my belly again!

Stop by for a tasty bite!

Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"We just ate gyros from here the other day and they were SO UNBELIEVABLY SALTY.  As always, the mozzarella sticks tasted like cleaning detergent... but I wouldn't ask it any other way.  I love Nyro's, and besides, the salt lick flavor can always be hidden by the most delicious cucumber yogurt sauce.  Oh yes, come to me, gyro."}
{"text":"yum! super good, really fast, yummy fries, no name ketchup wasn't too great. 
I wish they had Lebanese Garlic Sauce for the fries, That would be Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"This is a good Gyro, but nothing absolutely amazing.  I only tried the Gyro, and I will go back, but only if I am in the area.  They don't put lettuce on their Gyro's, I had to ask for it and it cost extra (lame)."}
{"text":"I am not usually a fan of Gyros, I guess because I grew up in the South and I was never impressed by any I had there.... So this place is really close to my office and my staff and I were all ready for lunch one day and we chose this place outta the blue.... SO YUMMY!  It's hard for me to not stop every time I drive by... One of my new favorites here :)  Thank you for a yummy lunch!"}
{"text":"Great simple and easy fare. It is always tasty and a great quick fix. The triple gyro plate will bust your belly!"}
{"text":"A great new find in Ahwatukee. The onion rings were great as was the double Gyro platter. Never seen a Gyro broken down to its components  ( Build your own ) but found the end result to be satisying. We will be back."}
{"text":"This is about as close as you are going to get to gyros back in Chicago. Niros has become my go to when I'm really craving it!"}
{"text":"I've enlightened a few people to this place recently (previous 2 reviews before me lol) and I've been going there for a couple years now.

1 of 2 best Gyros in Az... hands down.  Best gyros since moving away from Chicago...

Prices are extremely fair and the staff is always really nice.  Lots of seating too!"}
{"text":"Wayyyyyyyy overdue on the review.  I lived in the Ahwatukee area of Phoenix for about 3 years and sadly moved away from the area, so Niro's isnt quite as handy as it used to be.  Suffice to say, in the 3 years I lived just down the road, I ate here approximately once a week, on average.

I love gyros and will only vouch for them, on the menu, but if you really enjoy a good gyro - you cant go wrong here.  This is a mom and pop owned establishment and when they arent busy, the owners are great to chat with.  You can see their passion for providing great food and great service - even when they are busy.

I love this place and when I am down in that part of the valley I always take a quick detour to revisit and enjoy the gyros!  My choice - double diet.  Its double the gyro meat, without the fries and the pita.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I ordered online 40 minutes before close. That part was on me, but I called the place to check if I made the right order because I didn't know if I remembered to change the dropdown menu to say traditional gyro instead of chicken, as well as to make sure the order went through since it was late. I called the number at 12:40 AM and they said they were closed, although they close at 1 AM. The man who answered the phone was also extremely rude, had no idea what I was saying and just kept telling me that they were closed and my order would not be completed. I charged the order on my credit card, so I asked the man if he knew if the card would be charged. He didn't know what I was talking about and spewed a number at me to call.

I did call the number and they reimbursed me for the order, as well as gave me a coupon for future use, which was nice. If this was all that happened, I would be okay with it.

The man who picked up before called me back at 12:50 AM and I missed the call. I called them back at 1:00 AM and the man said that I ordered food and didn't come to pick it up. I told him that I called previously and he said that the restaurant was closed so I thought my food wouldn't be made, but he told me to come pick it up then and it was after hours. I asked if it was okay and if he was sure and he said he was. It took me 8 minutes to get there and when I got there, I pulled up to the drive thru and the man who picked up the phone told me he threw out the food because I came after hours, after he told me it was okay to come. 

Anyway, I didn't even try the food, but the customer service and miscommunication was enough for me to never come back."}
{"text":"Great discovery!  This is a fast food restaurant in a little shopping center, simple, clean and delicious! 
We got the Philly  steak sandwich and a gyro meal, french fries and onion rings. YUMMY! 
Service was one of the best things, the girl at the register is adorable, nice and kind. She was helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"I have been going here 2009 since I was a freshman. The owner is super nice and it is the best gyro on campus. Ask for a free Baklava maybe he will give you one ;)"}
{"text":"Bug in my food. Need I say more...."}
{"text":"The food here is mediocre. The taziki sauce had no flavor at all. My salad was the  compised of the thick centers from iceberg  lettuce. Gyro meat should be carmelized on the spit. The meat I had on my salad looked like it had been carved off and set aside to get cold. If you want aurhentic and delicious Middle Eastern food, especially a gyro salad or sandwich, invest the 15 minutes and go to Haji Baba on Apache Boulevard in Tempe. I've been driving by Nino's for years wondering about it. Now I know not to waste my time."}
{"text":"Made an order over the phone for twelve guys. Guy tells me they don't deliver, but they'll make an exception for us because we are ordering so much food and are not far away. 

Guy gives us the total and we all throw our cash together and wait.

Fast forward one hour. I call back because the food hasn't arrived. Owner takes the call. \"Yeah I fired the guy who took your order. He was a lazy scoundrel and never worked hard anyway. We didn't make any food for you.\"

But that's not what bothers me. What bothers me is that no one called to tell us there wasn't going to be a delivery. Also, I'm sure no one got fired and the owner was just lying to me.

{"text":"I ordered the Artichoke Chicken Pita on 12/26/16 at 5:50pm and contracted severe Salmonella poisoning by 9:00pm that night. I did not eat anything else that would have caused this, other than this food. As a medical provider, I strongly advise consumers avoid this restaurant. I reported this restaurant to the Maricopa County Environmental Services"}
{"text":"Niro's was another one of my close to home bookmarks and I went there for lunch. Simple, clean space, not crowded. I ordered a gyro, fries and soda. The gyro was good, although lukewarm. I like my food hot! Nice amount of meat, sauce, lettuce and tomatoes. I've never been to Greece ( I would love to!) but I had my share of gyros at NY diners and gyro places and I like those better. 
The fries I could have lived without, and I love fries, even not so good ones.
 
It would not be my first choice to eat at, but it was good enough."}
{"text":"Great gyro but bad costumer service. They did a mix up on my drink and no one wanted to help change it."}
{"text":"Food was appalling, the service was mediocre, and the restaurant is incredibly out dated."}
{"text":"Far from the best gyro I've ever had but the owner is a doll and the place was very clean and all the customers in the place seemed happy."}
{"text":"So delicious! Really hit the spot after a long hike. The sauce on the gyro is amazing. The single is HUGE! Loved the Greek fries as well, the cheese and herb blend was amazing."}
{"text":"Line to order lunch at 1:30pm was 10:00 minutes. Service was working hard just that a lot of orders and take out.    Once order it was ready quickly. We had the double gyro plate which was a large lunch. No shortage of meat. I found it to be very tasty."}
{"text":"This place is legit. The gyro meat is always tender and flavorful. Do yourself a favor and get the onion rings instead of fries. They're greasy, but worth it. I go out of my way to stop by here."}
{"text":"Excellent taste , reasonable price for the amount of meat.

Zabiha +"}
{"text":"One of the few halal places in Champaign. I have only ever tried three of their items. Gyros, cheesburgers and gyro burger. Cheeseburgers are mediocre but everything else is good. My only complain is the place is too small. Not much space inside to relax and eat. Also the fact that even water costs money is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight. Ordered a triple gyro plate. As always, the food was perfect and the wait was short. 

Highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who likes gyros. Decent portions and always served fresh and hot."}
{"text":"The Gyros are packed full and the fries are perfect. I recommend the onion rings though"}
{"text":"Much better than Zorbas! The gyros are moist, flavorful, and filling, and the fries are good too. The place is tiny though, so don't plan on eating there. Takeout and drive thru are the order of the day."}
{"text":"Schmeh, it's ok.  I think we like it because it's way close to the homestead, but it's not worth a special trip.  The gyros are cut so thin that they tend to crumble when you eat them, and the chicken gyro is not tasty.  The greek salad is rather lackluster, but the fries are crisp and hot and the pita is soft and tasty.  Still searching for the perfect gyro in Phoenix and this is not it.  Still, if I'm craving gyro in a hurry, Niro's is passable."}
{"text":"Artichoke Chicken Pita is SO good!
Love their fries too--halfway between steak fries and shoestrings...never soggy...nice.
Have had their burgers, gyros and Chicago-style hot dogs and everything is tasty, especially for its affordable fast food standards.
They get really busy at lunchtime but you can call ahead.
Staff has never been anything but friendly and efficient!
A definite semi-regular goto spot for our family!"}
{"text":"When you walk into Niro's Gyros, the place looks a little run down, but don't let that turn you away. My boyfriend and I tried this restaurant about a year ago because he loved gyros. He was very satisfied. The food is ALWAYS cooked fresh when we get there -- we don't mind waiting for hot food! I get the chicken pita and I have never had a bad meal. Also the food portions are huge!"}
{"text":"The gyros here are def the best in town, hands down.  Nice flavor, not dry with the perfect grease level.  Fries are best here if you ask for them well done, they get crispier. 

Just as good are the Italian beef sammies.  Dear gob, get them dipped in au jus and inhale 'em quick while the bread turns into a somehow delightful sogginess. 

Urbana side of town is take-away and drive-thru only."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a mid-west style fast food restaurant with both Gyros and Chicago Style Dogs for a long time.

The dogs have the bright fluorescent green relish and the sport peppers aren't too hot. The celery salt is just right.

The Gyros are over-stuffed and ooze all over as you eat them but that is the way I like it!"}
{"text":"Chicago style hot dog?!  Sign me up!  I just moved here from Chicago, and I've been dreaming of Portillo's since I left.  Where am I going to find something even close to that in AZ?!  I was hoping this would be it.  The hot dog wasn't that bad.  The fries on the other hand, weren't so good.  My husband ordered a beef with hot peppers (giardiniera), and they were far from hot...almost tasted pickled.  And the sandwich?  TINY!!!  It was like a 4\" beef sandwich!  I didn't taste it, but he said that it just tasted like a roast beef sammy...not the Chicago beef that we are used to.  One of these days we'll find a decent \"Chicago-style\" restaurant out here in AZ."}
{"text":"I had the original gyro.  Great tasting sauce, good proportions, soft pita bread,  hot fries and good prices.  Certainly not a fancy place but if you want a great meal that you can eat in your sweat pants then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Randomly found this place on the way home from ikea and it was incredible. The gyro meat was super tender and the staff was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Stopped by while on the other end of the world running errands.  I saw a sign and had heard about it so we went in and got some food.  Got a Gyro and a Chicken Picado Pita.  Both were amazing, and the extra tzatziki was really nice to dip the fries in.  The staff was really friendly and seemed to be checking on the customers to make sure everything was ok.  I'm wishing this place was closer so i could try more menu items, but i guess it will have to wait till i'm out that way!"}
{"text":"Every time I come I have the best food and service! This place is spectacular! I highly recommend it! Oh and the guys working here are pretty hot my mom says LOL."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning!!!!! I'll never come back! And the baklava was not good."}
{"text":"This was a great little Discovery. I'm a bigger guy and I walked out with leftovers. I've been driving all over the country for 11 years and I should've been writing reviews all this time. This place was Nice, clean and quiet. I engage in a conversation with Who I only assumed was the owner. He was very helpful and patient. I am going to pin this place in my Google maps for the next trip out here will definitely stop again. A lot of food for the money for what I ordered. I hope you have as good of experience as I did."}
{"text":"First time we found them open .  We ordered a gyro and a Chicago hot dog. Both were horrible. 
The gyro was skimpy, cold, the pita was stale and tasteless. The hot dog was also small and not really made like a chicago dog.
The place is run by a bunch of young kids who don't know or care about serving good food. 
Go to George's on McKellips you want a great Gyro"}
{"text":"Great food and I got great service there today. The girl at the counter was super friendly and helpful, her name was Rain I think? Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've seen this restaurant change its face several times. This time I hope it stays this way. Both times we ordered carry-out, the servers were wonderful. Our orders were ready, hot and accurate. 

The 10% discount from ASU students doesn't suck either.

 I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place just might be the home of the best gyro that I've ever tasted. I have weekly cravings for Niro's (which I often give in to) and I live about 20 minutes away! The service is great as it seems that the owners are always at the front register to chat with while you're waiting for your gyro."}
{"text":"Awesome gyros!  The regular gyro meat is very flavorful and full of seasoning.  The pitas are overstuffed with filling.  The tzatziki sauce is great.  The fries come in a tiny brown paper bag, and are very good also.  The service is super fast!  By the time we filled our fountain drinks and found a table our order was ready.  We were there for lunch and it was pretty busy, but they were serving up orders like crazy.  It also seemed very reasonably priced.  My boyfriend and I ate for $16 which is very cheap for us.  The portions are huge.  We were both stuffed after our single pita sandwiches and were only able to finish one order of fries between the two of us.  Which is unusual because we always finish our food...lol.  Definitely recommend you give this place a try."}
{"text":"Love this place, however, for a few years after it opened, I wouldn't go there simply because it looked crappy from the outside.  Turns out...I shouldn't judge a book by its cover!  The kids love the hot dogs, and I love the gyros!  I go there at least once a week now for lunch or dinner - seriously.  The service is fast and friendly...and the price is just right!"}
{"text":"Just 2 words for you Italian Beef! If you are from the midwest and miss good Italian beef sammies GO HERE NOW! 

I used to go to Niro's at least twice a week when I lived in Champaign, IL. Niro's opened in an old Rally's just 2 short blocks from my house. I became friendly with the owners. About a year later told them I was moving and they wouldn't be seeing me anymore. They asked where too & I said Phoenix and they said they were opening one in Phoenix not sure where. Well I found you again Niro! 

Love the Italian beef it is what I am used to from Illinois thanx!"}
{"text":"This place has been on my favorites list for 10 years. Love everything about it. Never too busy. Chicago style food. Best Gyro around. French fries are awesome with Tzaziki. Nice little hidden gem so not everyone knows about it. Baklava! Price is a little high but worth it."}
{"text":"Solid cheap drunk food. And when you're having a greasy day, don't want to cook, and want something different. Their gyros are the only thing good."}
{"text":"This place gives new meaning to FAST food! I ordered the diet gyro plate and a small Greek salad. Less than 3 minutes later I was walking out the door with my dinner. Incredible! The food's good, too. The veggies were fresh, the Greek salad had a great combinations of flavors. (I love the feta cheese!) And the gyro meat was great, too. Next time i'll probably try the large Greek salad with added gyro meat."}
{"text":"The food is great. The delivery drivers are nice. Whoever answers the phone will bitch you out though. I had a simple question and she treated me like I was stupid. I get that customer service sucks, but at least act like you like your job. I don't think I'll be ordering from them again. I don't support people who employ assholes."}
{"text":"Loving this place. My husband works right around the corner so this is always our go-to for a quick pick-up dinner. We've tried their Gyro's, Greek fries, philly sandwich, and greek salad. All really delicious. We are never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Not satisfied at all. Had been wanting to try this place for a few months, finally today I had it. I had a gyro salad. NOT GOOD. Boyfriend had a philly cheese steak, also not very good. Wont return my service, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Stopped here a couple of months ago for the first time and i love the place. Food always made to order and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Awesome gyros, although a tad expensive. I've only been here for food breaks when studying late at Siebel. The single gyros are priced on the expensive side, but the double and triple gyros are much better deals and you can easily split them between friends. Definitely go for takeout because the restaurant itself is small and cramped. 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Updated - we ate burgers and fries there last week to give it another shot. The fries were great. Perfectly crisp and not greasy but perfect. However the burger was pretty bad. Store bought, store brand bun, not toasted and soggy. Ick. But again the fries are good! So that's something... 
One of the most poorly made meals I've had claiming to be Mediterranean or greek food. The pitas were bread like, and dense not light and with air pockets. Kind of like a grocery store pita if you have ever had to substitute these last minute in a meal you will understand the difference. 
The lettuce on the platter was a whitish iceberg that wasn't green in the slightest. Tomatoes where the white kind that you would find on a Wendy's burger. Honestly the meal just lacked anything good. This was more comparable to a fast food quality than a sit down restaurant charging around $10 a meal. Places like Hummus Xpress or Byblos provide much better quality food and ingredients. Super sad that the quality wasn't better, as this place is right across the street from my house."}
{"text":"Quite little corner for a quick lunch or dinner... Service is quick... Chicken gyros are usually good but occasionally I find the meat not completely cooked... Just let them know you like it well done:) 
Ample parking space available in the lot. coupons and lunch specials are offered sometimes:)"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to eat and have not eaten at this spot in years... I entered the restaurant at lunch rush it was really busy. The staff really funny seeing how I never read everything fully I tried to order something off the kids menu... I said can I get the deal there she responded kind of cartoonish Noooooo it made me want to laugh so I said let me try again I ended up going with two Chicago Hot Dog (Relish, onions, mustard, pickles, tomatoes, sport peppers and celery salt. B+ good hot dog and an order of the French Fries D+ not the best fries.I will be back to this spot again for lunch."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Several things are good on the menu: gyro, Italian beef, philly steak, pizza pocket.  Burgers and fries are hit-and-miss."}
{"text":"I have always loved Gyros so when I moved to Ahwatukee I had to try them out. The inside was pretty outdated, I thought it was a little pricey compared to everywhere else I've been to get Gyros, but the service was fast! Anyways I've had better Gyros at Greek festivals and out of food trucks. It was ok....but nothing that made me want to come back."}
{"text":"Where to start? Perhaps Greece? That is my recommendation to Niro. I think because this family restaurant is located in the dessert, there is a belief that locals have nothing to compare it to as you would in Chicago, New York, or Philly. If this place was in one of those cities, would they stand out? Sadly no. But, when we consider it being in Ahwahtukee, we give some grace . Diaspora longing for their ethnic fix of packed pita pockets plump with processed lamb and beef, prepared possibly by expats of any part of the world...will be pleased.  But let me throw this in. There is no seen evidence by Niro to be anything but an iconic representation     of what a Greek fast food place would be like run by someone not Greek would be like. It saddened me for example to not see fries done as they do in Greece, and salads without tomatoes and cucumbers (mostly lettuce) and not even the occasional greek song playing on the sound system. Still, Niro did pack my sandwich with meat. That deserves distinction. If they would also not be sparing with the sauce, it would be much better. I purchased more for $0.60.
I am not sure what the extra cost is to get the sandwich hot. Mine was actually cold. But I ate it quietly thinking about how I might be able to make a return trip and not  expect more. Can I?"}
{"text":"Pros... 
Really good gyro meat, crispy fries! Yum!
Very friendly manager maybe owner? She was very informative and polite.
Clean area
Good amount of meat provided in gyro

Cons
Price is a little step for a gyro meal but not horrible. 
Dine in area is a little out dated

Overall a place I would come back too! My \"cons\" are me trying to come up with something... Place is legit!"}
{"text":"Great gyros, been looking for a good one. It's been a while since I can say I had one that taste like they actually do in Greece.  Good service food came out fast and was very fresh."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Gyros are the best thing to order from here. Almost like the real thing the Greeks make!"}
{"text":"Went out for a girls lunch - and as always it was great! The portion sizes are big, so we make sure it's the last place we go when we are out. We had left overs for days! The staff is always friendly and helpful, especially Pat who seems to remember our order! We have been going for a couple of years and still love it."}
{"text":"Quite a pleasant surprise.  Many menu choices all priced well.  I had a very good Italian beef sandwich."}
{"text":"This is the best gyro place in town, and one of the better meal values as well.  After 4PM there's a buy 2, get 3 deal on the gyros, which equates to dinner for you and a friend with either a snack for you when you get home at drunk-thirty, or when you wake up."}
{"text":"This was my first time in, I came with my dad who comes all of the time. He ordered a chicken gyro and I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich. He was over the moon for his gyro and the bite I tried was very flavorful. My chicken sandwich was solid, but the fries were amazing! They were not as thick as steak fries but reminded me of them in the crunchy outside, soft potato heaven on the inside. A bit disappointed they charged $0.30 for ranch but it was worth it for the fries. I was reluctant to go because I don't generally care for Mediterranean but they have an extensive enough menu that I know I could find more on the menu that I would enjoy."}
{"text":"Out of business, has been replaced by Sunny's Diner."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff with huge portions of gyro meat when you get the platters.  The fries are thick-cut and also a generous portion, although they can taste a little mealy.  The platter comes with warmed grilled pita, tomatoes, thinly sliced onion, and a cup of tzatziki sauce.  I shared the double gyro platter, and found that we still had a heaping mound of meat after eating 1 pita's worth of gyro sandwich each!  The double gyro platter is a little less than $11, and you can substitute chicken instead for $.75 per serving."}
{"text":"Drive through... check.
Italian sausage... check.
dipped... double check."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place out because of the good \"word of mouth\" reviews.

The service is awesome!  Feel right at home here.

It's pricey, but you get what you pay for.  Tons of meat just with a reg order of food, then they got double the meat.  What?  How much meat can you put in a pita?  Well, maybe I will try it next time.

The cheese fries and the onion rings are out of this world.  

Be prepared to spend about $10 per person.  Worth the try!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed after reading great reviews. The food was extremely quick in getting out. However, the gyro was so Greasy."}
{"text":"It's ok, for the price and speed it's fine for lunch but the quality isn't as good as other gyro places in town."}
{"text":"Big portions, decent price, but a little bland.  I had the Italian Beef Sandwich which was pretty bland but was overflowing with meat (and also completely fell apart when I stupidly decided to dump the side of gravy on it, instead of dunk my sandwich in the gravy).  My boyfriend had the Double Gyro Plate which was basically two unassembled gyros, giving you the fun of putting everything together.

After stealing a bite (or two, possibly three) of his gyro, I was starting to regret not ordering a gyro myself.  He, however, left rather unsatisfied, saying that the Niro's Gyros that used to be on McClintock and University tasted so much better.  So, not the best gyros around, but it'll do if you're craving gyros."}
{"text":"I love small business and this one especially! I had my first gyro when I was in Chicago at a Greek festival and haven't been able to find one that compares until I found this place! The food is always yummy and I'm never disappointed! My favorite thing, besides their gyros, is their Greek salad with chicken strips! Not only is their food great but their service is incredible!!"}
{"text":"I stop in after work at the Niro's in Urbana.  Love their italian beef dipped with sweet peppers and mozzarella cheese.   I have to say the Niro's in Urbana has much better food than the one in Champaign near Marketplace.  I thought for convenience sake, I would go to the Champaign Niro's and was disappointed with their italian beef which was greasy and just not as juicy and good as the one I am used to getting at the Urbana Niro's."}
{"text":"Great little fast-food joint. Although I prefer Zorba's for their gyros, I do like Niro's as well. They also make great Italian beef sandwiches and fries. Food is always hot and fresh and served with a smile."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab some Gyros, hot dogs, and other chicago type Greeky yumz! The space is.. spacious! The prices are great, and the food is pretty fantastic. LO CARB GYRO PLATES!! YASSS! ALSO, (contradicting myself.. but whatevs) THE ONION RINGS ARE SOOOO GOOD.  Very similar to Niro's in Ahwatukee.. Ok like.. the same thing. Just newer. and BIGGER! and closer to my house. yay! Niro's!"}

Ok, that's the best I could do to replicate Sean's impressively objective rating system without committing all out plagiarism.  It's just that I've chosen to include slightly different criteria.

The fries are indeed cooked in grease from the heavens, and then served in a big greasy brown paper pouch.  They were so much better than most I've had, especially from such an apparent hole-in-the-wall place.

The gyro was heaping full of flavorful, salty lamb/beef (at least I assume that's the mix, even though the menu doesn't specify).  It is then drenched in a creamy tzatziki sauce and topped with onions and tomato.  In all, very good.

Another plus was the fact that the manager/owner told me he would have my meal ready in less than five minutes from when I ordered over the phone.  While I was at first a tad suspicious that quality might suffer from such hasty preparation, I decided to happily roll with the welcome comfort of an immediately sated appetite.

And sated I was..... I now feel like I'm moments away from a food coma as I digest this big gut bomb.  The only comfort I have is that I got to chuckle a little bit about the owner/manager interrogating and berating his employee (family member?) in front of me as he inquired about how I discovered his restaurant.  When I said that it was from an ex-employee having left a menu and not from his guys dropping one off, he decided that maybe he should go deliver the damn menus to area businesses himself!  I agree that this is a sensible idea -- he sounded like he needed a break from the restaurant.

Overall pretty good.  I just might be back again soon.  But I do think the prices could stand to drop a buck or so."}
{"text":"Went last night for my first time and had the Italian beef with au jus and a side of onion rings. DEFINITELY delicious and DEFINITELY will be back to try other menu items. If you like Italian beef, this is a good spot for you!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout and later saw on my statement the worker added a $5 tip to my credit card. When I confronted the manager/owner they have the nerve to say my credit card company charged the wrong amount. Um no, your employee is trying to steal and input fraudulent totals. 

Decent food but you'll never see another penny of mine with your shady business practices!"}
{"text":"I came here Saturday afternoon for the first time, and really am glad that I did.  I am always on the hunt for a good gyro, and this place definately has them.

I carried out just the gyro only, no drink or salad. I was going to sit down and eat in the resturant, but was so tired, that I decided to carry out instead.  The place was empty, except for one lady who was finishing up eating when I walked in.

Service was great, food was awesome.  I got a huge amount of meat with my gyro, and was extremely happy with the portion size here.  Will be back in the future for more."}
{"text":"So I have lived across the street from this place for years and have never tried it. I will be completely honest it was the appearance of the building that really discouraged my interest in eating here. The other day my friend talked me into going here and man am I upset that I haven't been coming here for years! This place is amazing! I have once again been reminded to not judge a book by its cover. I hope everyone gets a chance to enjoy the great food Niro's Gyros has to offer!"}
{"text":"Zorba's made me skeptical of gyros in Champaign-Urbana, and then I tried Niro's.  The gyros are delicious!  Here's a tip:  if you're getting more than one gyro, go for the double or triple gyro plate rather than getting individual gyros. The prices are pretty similar, but you get fries, more sauce, and more meat.  You have to assemble the gyro yourself then, but that way you can get the perfect sauce to meat ratio.  The meat is really greasy, so I usually blot away as much as I can with a napkin or two.  That's eating healthy, right?

The fries are also pretty good, and I don't like fries all that much.  The cheese fries are awesome, but it's just a cup of cheese with an order of fries.  If you pay a bit more for the chili cheese fries, you get a ton more fries and cheese, plus chili.  It would be nice if the order of cheese fries was as large!

I haven't really tried anything else on the menu.  My boyfriend has tried more and liked it all.  Take his word for it, if you want, or just stick with the greasy, but oh so good gyros."}
{"text":"Always good food and good service. Best gyros around. I know I always get speedy service so I can eat my food and not be there for hours."}
{"text":"What the heck? Did I go to a fake Niro's Gyros? My experience was trash compared to the rest of the yelpers here.

They had 2 burgers and fries for $5.99 on special. I thought I ordered that and even tried to point at the marker board to the woman taking my order, who clearly looked as if English was not her primary language. I also ordered 1 single gyro. It came out to $15.

What I actually got was 2 burgers, a single gyro but no fries. I would have went back but didn't realize it until I was already home. I could have sworn I said \"THE TWO BURGERS AND FRIES\". Even after my order was taken I thought I heard her shout my complete, correct order to the cook. No receipt was given so who knows if it was right at all?

Anyway, the burgers were most certainly not worth $3 each, they were mostly bread and only come with 2 pickles, ketchup and mustard. Cheese is also $0.50 per burger, and honestly was comparable in taste to a McDonald's \"burger\", if you even want to call that garbage a burger at all.

Next was the gyro which I was hoping was going to be at least a little better than the burgers; it wasn't. Yes, it was a large portion of gyro meat but quantity does not make up for quality, for me. At nearly $6, this monstrosity was way too greasy. I know gyros are a greasy food, but this was excessive. The paper it was wrapped in was soaked and I had to pick it off in pieces. The grease content was similar to a $4, 1lb burrito you get in the bad neighborhoods of Chicago. Regardless, the two slices of tomato were fairly large but there were hardly any onions on it at all, maybe 2 small O slices, but I'm doubtful either of them were fresh. The tzatziki sauce was hard to taste from being drowned out by all the grease, making it more of a watery, greasy mess. I didn't care for this gyro at all, the only thing going for it was the quantity of meat. However, my local beef stand back in the suburbs has a gyro that isn't half as greasy and in my opinion is much better. Oh, did I mention it costs $2 less?

I had high expectations for Niro's but my order was not correct, I got less food than I paid for and the food I got was poor, at best. Yes, the place was busy and maybe it was an honest mistake, but I spent $15, which can get you a lot of other [better] things in Champaign-Urbana that might actually include a drink, or perhaps a correct order.

Sorry guys! 1 star for portions, if that.....

P.S. I thought the gyro at Zorba's was MUCH better than Niro'!"}
{"text":"This is the best Greek I've found in the east valley. Great portion size, great flavor, great price. I miss the days when my wife worked near the location and would bring it home for dinner!"}
{"text":"There are those times when you just need to snarf a gyro. Is it the novelty of lamb or the exotic Middle Eastern spices? I can't explain it, but I was feeling the need for some righteous shaved gyro meat, tzatziki sauce and sliced onions crammed into a pita. This place did not disappoint.

Niro's single gyro is generously stuffed with meat. And the meat is heavily seasoned, so you really get the spice you're hoping for. That's a gyro done right in my opinion. I developed a taste for these in the Sachsenhausen district of Frankfurt, Germany. They always had a gyro cart popping up in your path whilst trekking betweenst bars. Let's face it, even completely sober, a well-made gyro is a thing of beauty (and gluttony).

The windows on this place are so heavily tinted, it's hard to tell if there's any activity inside. It was late afternoon, so I happened to be the only person ordering at the time. But while enjoying my meal, hungry stragglers popped in and out, proving to me that other serious gyro lovers make the trek here for gyros that are built to satisfy."}
{"text":"Ordered food over 90 minutes ago...it has not been delivered yet. Have been trying to call for the past 10 minutes and no one is picking up. The past few times we have ordered, the wrong food was delivered to us and we had to call and have the driver sent back. I never used to have so many issues with bad service here. This is the last time I will order from this location, and I will tell everyone I know about this poor experience. Once or twice, I know things happen...it gets busy. But this is the last straw.

Update: After TWO HOURS, I drove down there. I was informed that their driver never showed up, so they weren't doing deliveries. I was livid. When I asked why I had not been called, I was shown a STACK of phone in orders and told, \"We were too busy,\" and  they admitted that they had stopped answering the phone.  The so-called manager just kept making poor excuses. You cancelled deliveries for the evening, neglected to call the 20+ people you took orders from and let them know, then stopped answering the phone?!?! He even stated they were going to be closing early due to not having enough staff. After they made our food for us, they locked up. So all those people who ordered food were ignored. That is absolutely horrendous customer service. You have lost my business, and I was a regular long-time customer!"}
{"text":"These are some great gyros. The best time to come is in between 11:00am and 3:00pm when they have their specials. Every day, they have a special where you can get gyro and fries or Italian beef and fries for $6.19 (drinks not included). Here's a list of all their daily specials (which do include drinks): 
Monday: Italian beef meal $5.99
Tuesday: Gyro meal $5.99 
Wednesday: Chicken breast meal $5.09
Thursday: Phili steak meal $6.09 
Friday: Cod fish meal $5.09
Saturday: Grilled chicken pita meal $6.29"}
{"text":"I have only had one experience from here. Ordered a gyro-cheeseburger as I was looking for something of the sort--fat & greasy. Read a lot of reviews and in the past I was real fond of gyros and have tried Zorba's & Geovantis. Geovantis's gyros being the better of those two. 

It was rather tasty, nothing spectacular though. Very fulfilling. However, the fries were extra greasy and looked like they had been fried in really old grease, tasted like it too.

I would definitely say its worth a try if you're hungry and in the mood for such a meal. I am pretty sure their gyros are delicious."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite, especially since I live in Ahwatukee. My favorite menu item is the  vegetarian gyro. Just tangy, yummy goodness!  Everything that I have tried has been excellent. If you are in the Tukee stop by for some great food."}
{"text":"I use to love going here my freshman year. I had never had a gyro before and I thought it was all amazing. Since then, I've been multiple times and each time I'm slightly disappointed.  Their meat doesn't seem that fresh, their cheese for fries looks plasticky, and their gyros are rather bland.  The perks are that they're really cheap, you can get 3/$11. They also have good pizza puffs which bring me back to my child hood."}
{"text":"This place has the best hummus I've had since relocating from London to the Midwest. Everything else was also excellent and the service was very nice."}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating the Gyros here.  They are huge and the fries are great.  The gyros are so stuffed that I have to take a few bites of the meat before I can close it up to eat.  The Chicago Dogs are also very good."}
{"text":"Niro's is a staple.  Quick, easy lunch that hits the spot when you're feelin like gyros.  I'm not saying it's the best gyro I've ever had, nor am I saying it's the cheapest (around $9 total), but it gets the job done.  

I usually get the single gyro meal when I go.  The fries are the thick cut super crispy kind, and the gyros are cooked well, with plenty of sauce (not sure what people are saying about it being dry, my hand's are always a mess after eating one of these), and onions and tomatoes to boot.  Great in-and-out spot if you didn't bring lunch to work on any given day.  Plus, the owner is always really nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Your low end sammich place had italian beef a few times never felt good after. Price is right."}
{"text":"One of the better gyros I have had here in the valley. They provide a generous helping of meat for your hard earned dollar. However, the place is so big and open that it feels empty - they could use a location half this size or maybe add some pool tables and a beer bar to draw the college crowd? It has the proximity to the 101 and ASU to become a winner!"}
{"text":"Arizona seems to lack good Greek food, especially Gyros...that's why being from the Midwest I was so happy when a good Gyro place finally opened in Tempe.  It's in a great location, right on the corner of University and McClintock so It's easy to get to on the way to or from class.  Their Gyro is very well portioned and is way bigger than any other Gyro I had in Arizona.  Their Gyro meat is well spiced there's definitely alot of it in the pita along with a good helping of the cucumber sauce that really accentuates the meat.  I usually just get the Gyro by itself and that usually enough to fill me up...wow, just describing the place makes me want to make a quick run and grab it for dinner right now, seriously."}
{"text":"Ok!  I would return. Nothing fancy that is for sure. Very simple. Ordered a gyro and Greek salad. Sauce for gyro is extra. Portions are fine. Taste is fine. Salad was fine. Again...nothing special but you cannot go wrong if you want simple and quick. In other words...nothing exotic. No special herbs. Etc. lots of parking. All self serve."}
{"text":"Well, my family and I grabbed a quick late night bite to eat. So,where do I begin, I ordered a Maxwell Street polish, it was the size of a jumbo hot dog with tons of mustard and giant pieces of celery and half dollar size jalapenos! ! Sorry but why celery and raw jalapeno's with a side of cigarette smoke courtesy of the workers in back! No thank you!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and got the double gyro plate. The pita, meat and sauce was really good and the fries were pretty decent as well. I would definitely go back here. They also got the food out quickly."}
{"text":"Got the double gyro plate, it was great!  LOTS of meat, fresh sliced sweet onion & tomato, a cup of yogurt sauce, 2 flatbreads, and fries.  Meat was delicious, and freshly sliced from the spit; the bread was great too. The fries were very good as well.  Lots of food for a decent price, and nice service at the counter."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Niro's since the day they opened the food is good always has been and there was always more than you can eat but my last few visits the quality is still there but the quantity of the food you get has dropped and the price has increased it used to be I couldn't eat an entire Gyro in one setting because they were so large now I could eat two, The price has also increased to wear it just is not of a good value anymore to eat I could go to a sitdown restaurant and be served by a waiter for the same kind of money sorry Niro's but I'll be going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Super good food. Got my food really fast it was nice and fresh. And tasted so good. People that work working was really friendly. The whole place was really clean also. I am definitely going to come back to Niro's Gyros."}
{"text":"Nice try, but nothing memorable or worth going back for."}
{"text":"I like their chicago dog. It is delicious. I've had good service here because mostly the owners are almost always working and they are real nice. It's only when they are gone that you get the crummy service."}
{"text":"Yummy gyro with great flavor and no lettuce, thank you! Good home made tasting tzaziki sauce for your gyro. The onion rings are spot on too."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. I've eaten here about 3 times, each time my bread has been extremely soggy and the fries taste like their using old oil from the 80's"}
{"text":"Greek Fries...... The fries have good crisp, feta is amazing, and parmesan is parmesan, oregano is oregano. Overall though it's dry, it needs the olive oil or some vinaigrette at least to bind the feta and parmesan to the fries. If you choose it's this item, I recommend getting a side of sauce.....like tzikii"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of their vegetarian gyro.  It's filled with lettuce, tomatoes, tons of feta and tzatziki.  There isn't much ambiance but the food is great, cheap and fast.  Their fries are tasty too, and I'm generally not much of a french fry person, and come in the cutest little brown paper bags."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant run by husband-and-wife who serve excellent Chicago dogs and sandwiches, but most importantly excellent gyros. My whole family is always supper happy with a gyro meal comprised with gyro, tyzekee sauce, fries, and Greek salad. Warning that this place is packed at lunch, but they hustle to get your order out quickly. 
Update: These guys are still the best. A friend took me to another Mediterranean restaurant in the neighborhood and boy was it disappointing by comparison. Niros knows how to make the perfect Gyro meat with lamb in it and a fantastic gyro with Greek salad."}
{"text":"Fabulous. I know this is a gyro place, but I get the chicken Picado pita. It has chicken, green bell pepper, onions and jalape√±os on a pita with tzaziki sauce I believe. To die for! It has a little kick to it (which I love) and you can order it with a side of Greek fries (fries with feta cheese and lemon... Mm). My boyfriend gets the classic gyro. He loves it, but I'm just not a fan of gyro meat. I'm sure anyone who is would love it, though. It has very interesting interior and it is owned by a sweet couple from what I remember. 

If you like a little heat in your pita, order the chicken Picado. If not, keep it traditional with the gyro. You won't go wrong either way."}
{"text":"Lots of food and grease. Enuff said."}
{"text":"It's decent I'm pregnant and I was craving a gyros saw the billboard on the highway and decided to seek this place out. The gyros are good I ordered three. They don't give enough meet but it was decent. Fries were okay  $2 gyros  $6 a piece also got a grilled cheese $3 my daughter ate that she said it was not that good to much cheese and bread was too thin. I would go back for gyros. Man seemed grumpy at the counter but he was nice."}
{"text":"I've been craving Niro's for over a week now. I have no idea why, it's just been there, grinding on the back of my mind. Eat a gyro, eat a gyro, eat a gyro. 
But every time that I think I can get over there, something happens. 
It's too late, it's snowing, it's Thursday and you eat somewhere else on Thursday. I need other things from the store, so I have to go to schnucks instead. It's past lunch time, and someone else doesn't want to eat as late as i'm going to be hungry.
Last night, the stars finally aligned, I was able to get to Niro's!
It was relatively early in the post-drinking night, probably not even midnight. Which is odd, because I normally am working somewhere, but today I had the early shift. 
So, I pull into the drive through, there are 3 cars in front of me, and like 4 people inside (that I can see from the drive through). Oddly, even with taco-bell's new menu item, there was no one at taco bell. 
So I order a triple gyro platter. Because, SO MUCH MEAT!!!
It was promptly prepared, and I got it in the car. And the smell was just so... amazing. Soooo HUNGRY!!!
Start to drive away, and low carb diet be damned, I ate one of the pitas. 
Finally get to the house, get inside and open the bag of meat. Start to dip it in the tzatziki, and it's as good as I remembered. 
I miss working with Skot, whenever i'd get Niro's before, Skot would always ask, \"give you a dollar for some meat\". But he's not there :(
So, I eat the whole damn thing, I don't even eat a fry, because... I never really liked anyones fries anyway. So, if anyone wants the other 2 pitas, I've got them."}
{"text":"Niro's, where have you been all my life? ... Gyro meat is moist and spicy and delicious... You also literally get a \"mound\" of meat. A single plate (one pita, meat, tomatoes, onions, and sauce) runs $5 ... $6.50 with drink and fries. Count on one plate being lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I recently made a trip back to UIUC for a visit. There were a few places that i had to hit, and this was one of them. during my undergraduate days, I used to live in apartments just a few blocks away from Niro's, and it was definitely one of those 1 or more times a week places. The prices were unbeatable and the food was delicious. My order is usually the burger with fries and drink (a #1 meal if i remembered right). Back a few years ago, they used to outside of the hamburger buns a little, but it doens't seem like they do that anymore. However, the burger tastes basically just as i remembered. The order of fries is also the same size, and the prices are still low. 

It was a great to come back and see that the quality of food is still the same as before. Come here for a cheap and tasty late night meal!"}
{"text":"We split a single gyro and a side order of Greek fries. This place is absolutely delicious and the PERFECT price for a great taste in food! You probably won't find a better gyro place anywhere nearby. We WILL be going back and trying their Chicago dogs VERY soon!!"}
{"text":"Restaurant review
I can see why the reviews are all over the place for this Niro Gyro. Yes it is one of the few locations in town where you can get gyros. The prices are so so except for the specials. I ordered the everday special which included gyros and fries which was 6.89. Compared to the 8.99 weekend double gyro platter with fries and drink at the Super Niro Gyro this was quite expensive. The person taking the order was not friendly at all and I felt like I was doing a favor for them with ordering. Food was prepared quickly. Very oily and hot which I guess summarizes any gyro experience. The only other issue is with the super dinky parking lot. Overall since the other location open on prospect avenue, they have earned my business with good food, great deals, and friendly people.

Pros: gyros, daily special

Cons: unfriendly service, small parking lot, very greasy

Hidden deals:
Daily Specials
Monday: Italian Beef Meal for $6.89
Tuesday: Gyro Meal for $6.89
Wednesday: Chicken Breast Meal for $5.79

Saturday: Grilled Chicken Pita Meal for $5.79"}
{"text":"Good size portions for the price. Nice, friendly girl taking my order. I ordered the double gyro plate, and the only thing was... I could only eat half of it, and the leftovers made my fridge reek of gyro meat for a couple days. Also, the fries, leftover, were a little gritty the next day."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and it's amazing how slow the service is when the owners aren't there.  Ordered a to-go order and was told 10 minutes. Got there about 15 minutes later and there was only a couple people sitting down eating. Said I had a to-go order and it wasn't even ready. Worker told they guy to make it and as I waited, a woman behind me ordered a sandwich and I got mine maybe 10 seconds before her. Not sure what the point was in calling an order in! Sheesh!"}
{"text":"A no-frills, no charm grease spoon.  I felt ill after eating the hot dog here.  I hear the italian and gyro sandwiches are tasty here, but I'm too scared to go back.  It has some regulars and seems to be a popular place with the guys.  Try your luck and write a review."}
{"text":"On the way home from the library, I was in hunt of food again, and it seems like I found Greek/Mediterranean food again.  I have driven on McClintock at least a hundred times passing Niro's.  I decided that I was not going to make any food at a late night, and I made a sudden sporadic right turn into the plaza.  I wasn't super hungry, but I wanted a decent meal.  I am on somewhat of a calorie restriction, and I did not have many left due to the fact I had some cake earlier in the day.  Niro's had a diet menu which basically served the gyro without the pita bread.  I am not that crazy about pita bread, so I gave it a shot.  The chicken was like the shaved meat that is typical of beef or lamb.  It was flavorful but not overwhelming.  My meat came with fresh tomatoes, onions, lettuce, and cucumber type sauce on the side.  This was a delicious and light meal."}
{"text":"Amazing drunk food for sure! Their gyros and cucumber sauce is pretty excellent. Also amazingly cheap and filling. I'd definitely recommend it after a long night out or some recovery food :)"}
{"text":"Just had the Tuesday special (Single Gyro fries and drink) for $6.89. Good amount of food for the money, sandwich was not lacking anything. Pita bread was nice and soft, everything tasted fresh. Only downside is there is no place to sit down and eat with others. There are 4 stools against the mirrored wall where you could eat if you wanted to, but not comfortably."}
{"text":"Fantastic quality and great value gyros large portions quality ~ bright colorful interior design - traditional gyro meal is a good sized portion - great pricing - family owned and it shows in the service and overall quality - check out the greek fries for a great taste -fries topped with Feta cheese  Parmesan and Oregano - always running online specials so check yelp or the website - can't beat the value - be for warned the triple gyro plate will fill two easily - a bit hard to find but we'll worth the search - use yelp directiobs to find - two people will leave stuffed with great food and a smile on their faces including drinks and a tip 20 bucks with coupon"}
{"text":"Buy two get one gyros, deep friend mushrooms, that's all that matters.  Just do it, enjoy it, and feel slightly bad about yourself because the paper bag that you got your food in has a grease stain at the bottom."}
