{"text":"Authentic Lebanese flavors. Love the tawook on saaj bread. Very yummy. Best I've had in calgary. Prices are decent and the food is fresh. I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"Best schwarma in town - the Sam's special is a sensory overload of pure deliciousness."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to eat in the neighborhood. I would highly recommend it. The service is always friendly, but do not be in a hurry. Good food takes time."}
{"text":"Great for a casual night or lunch. The food here is delicious I highly recommend it!! Location could be better though."}
{"text":"Forget about Shawarmas and donairs.. Get the Shish Tawook wrap. You wont regret it! It changed my life haha"}
{"text":"This place is within walking distance to my work so i eat there every  now and again. They have a really cool atmosphere and a clean restaurant. I always get the chicken Sharma which is better then the one at dessert pita grill on 52nd. The staff are really nice and helpful, you don't feel dumb if its your first time eating Lebanese food and you don't know what half the things on the menu are."}
{"text":"Excellent by each such fights they were excellent amazeballs totally the best Mediterranean here on 40th Ave and 19th Street come check it out if you can and that we were to stop by even though its basic it's exactly what I needed for hitting the spot and extremely individualistic for what is here then we recommend the saaj bites.

Sirii u failes me"}
{"text":"Went here on a buddy's recommendation. Had beef donair - incredible value for your $$. A regular size is equivalent to a large at other places, and they use real beef (ie not the part-processed stuff at other donair shops). Owner recommended the saaj bites which were so fresh and amazing in taste. 

Will definitely be back - real gem of a find!\" For authentic Lebanese food!"}
{"text":"The best Shawarma's in Calgary! Very friendly service. Family owned. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Just opened in may 2013. Great chicken and beef Donairs with fresh ingredients and good sauces.   Regular size was perfect, wouldn't need the large.  Must try the baklava.  Prices were reasonable"}
{"text":"I eat a ton of Lebanese food, but Saaj is definitely in my top 3 restaurants. This is mostly because of their Saaj bites--moist, seasoned chicken wrapped in super thin pita bread (called saaj bread), fried and served with garlic sauce and veggies or fries. MMM!!!!! At $9/order it's a little steep, but really life-changingly delicious! The only thing I would say is that they are inconsistent with the side veggies they give; sometimes they give you the full variety (lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, turnips, etc.) and sometimes they cheap out. So make sure you watch them plate your food so that they don't skimp.

But seriously, you HAVE to visit this place if you are a self-proclaimed Lebanese food lover! And order the Saaj Bites ;-)"}
{"text":"Since the new owners have taken over there haven't been many improvements. In fact, the service and speed has taken a bit of a hit.

Quite often the kitchen is disorganised and you need to repeat your order and choices multiple times.  Lettuce is often wilting or browning on the edges. Some days you get happy people asking how you are doing and chatting you up.  Some days you get a very stoic type of attitude.

Overall the food and prices are still good but it's downgraded from a 5 to a 3."}
{"text":"Went in on a Tuesday and asked for the platter, I have to say it was not as fresh as the first time I went in, the beef kebab skewer had a bitter aftertaste and the chicken chunks were much smaller.  Also, the hummus just wasn't up to par this time around and the salad was quite dry.

They did upgrade their front entrance which looks a lot better but there is junk remnants outside the front door where the reno took place.

Not sure if I will make a trip out here or get the platter again but if I'm in the area I might try a wrap.  Jerusalem Sharwama offers a much better platter for cheaper."}
