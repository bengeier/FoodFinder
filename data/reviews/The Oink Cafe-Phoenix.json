{"text":"Not really impressed. I ordered bacon pancakes...right... they had jalapeno bacon in them and not just a little. There was too much to finish. If that was the way they served them they should have said so. Server apologized that everything took so long and then disappeared. I finally went up and got more coffee myself. They did not appear that busy and there were 3 servers on but everyone got crappy service as far as I could see. Maybe they have another dining room I don't know about that they all went to. When I complained about the jalapenos (she should have asked why I only ate half) she took it off the bill. The manager never came out, no one said anything when I got up to get more coffee. They might need to hire more help."}
{"text":"Best bacon ever! They're Belgium waffle was delicious and service was fast and friendly"}
{"text":"This is a new neighborhood breakfast joint in a building many think is \"cursed\".  The turnover for businesses at this location is high.  But I think Oink is going to make it!  They were very busy when we were there so it took a little bit to get refills on coffee (need bigger cups) and the food took a couple minutes longer, but no worries.  Who I think is the owner was not just standing by and watching everyone else run around like chickens with their heads cut off, they were serving, clearing plates, filling coffee.  Love to see that!    The menu is decent.  I'm not a huge breakfast person but there were quite a few items on the menu I was interested in.  The funny thing is my hubby and I ended up not ordering any bacon and didn't realize this until after we finished eating!  So we definitely will be going back to try the bacon they are known for....jalapeno bacon anyone!"}
{"text":"I love coming here! The staff is always on point even when busy! I bring all my friends and family here whenever I can. It's a great spot for a high quality meal for a great price. I love sitting on the patio with my dogs. I come every weekend and know I'm going to have a great meal... With tons of perfectly cooked BACON!!"}
{"text":"Not very good. Bacon was a complete let down. Hash browns were oily and too crunchy.   Way too much butter/ oil on it. It was soggy from it. Service was quick and polite. Nothing special here. Kid friendly and has a patio."}
{"text":"Poor service and soggy food.  I waited over 15 minutes just to get someone to my table.  Then i had to wait another 10 minute to order.  When the food finally arrived, the bun on the burger was soggy.  When I said I thought the service and food was terrible, they said \"sorry.\"    So if this is what you like, enjoy."}
{"text":"Bacon madness! Huge french toast! Cute little piggies decorating the orange walls!  Oink is a friendly, peppy place to go for breakfast. The food is pretty good, the place is happy, all-in-all I would say this is the perfect place to wake up in the morning!  The only irksome quality was our server, who seemed very nervous, checked on us at weird times, and said \"you're welcome\" too often (I didn't know that was possible, but it was).   I enjoyed the jalapeno (!) bacon and the oink french toast. The cinnamon rolls were also tasty, but my group was disappointed by the eggs benedict. I would say the food could be better, but it's just awesome to have a local breakfast place somewhere in my neighborhood now!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast place! I love the pork confit benedict is top notch. We have done the flight of bacon more then once and it's always the jalapeno smoked that wins. The service is always lovely!"}
{"text":"Bacon flight and bacon crusted donuts were incredible.  Service was fast and friendly!!  A must visit. Especially if you like bacon. Who doesn't??"}
{"text":"Worst chorizo I have ever tasted... Never again!!! I ordered the Arizona omelet and it was covered in \"ranchero\" sauce that had the worst flavor. I will never be back."}
{"text":"Several visits...I REALLY wanted to like this place because it us close by , and good breakfast places are hard to come by.  The hostesses are blasé about  their jobs. Even with dozens of people waiting, they have no sense of urgency about getting people seated.  On our LAST (read: FINAL) visit, we asked to be seated outside. The hostess started to seat us at a table with splats of bird poop on the table. I told her no thank you, I did not wish to be seated at a table with bird doo on it. No apology. Just, \"So you want to go inside then?\"  We did. I asked to speak with the manager. He was just full of excuses.  \"They get busy\" is what we were told. BY THE MANAGER!  ???????? That's disgusting. I understand the birds are not trained. I understand it is outside. But to actually be willing to SEAT someone at a TABLE covered in bird poop makes me wonder what the kitchen is like.  Does the kitchen staff get too busy to wash their hands? Too busy to clean the pans?  Too busy to remember not to put the cooked bacon where the raw bacon has been? No thank you."}
{"text":"I love this place. Evey time we go the staff is terrific and the food of great. And the bacon donuts don't disappoint. For me, Oink is great alternative to IHOP (meh) and Chompie's (good, but overwhelming). It's a locally-owned neighborhood spot for a good breakfast in an intimate setting. We've never had an issue with the food or the service. When we were there last month the owner was walking to each table, talking to customers, and just making sure they/we were ok. This morning we went with friends and the GM was doing the same thing. He stopped at our table, made a genuine effort to talk to us and our kids (making a big to-do about hanging their pig pictures on the wall), and made sure we were well taken care of. Stuff like this goes a long way with me, and is a big reason why I will keep coming back. I always order the Pig in a Blanket which never disappoints. Love this place! There have been so many restaurants come and go in this space over the years. . . .I hope this one stays for a while."}
{"text":"Great bacon- Try the the bacon flight to sample all of their flavors! My favorites are the jalapeño, pepper, and honey cured bacon.   Great coffee- fresh and smooth. Always hot.   Great pancakes- the bacon pancakes have small pieces of bacon in the batter. They are topped off with more pieces of bacon and powdered sugar. Yum!   Another great dish is the Huevos Rancheros. The sauce served with them is thick and flavorful."}
{"text":"Love it, the food is always good, takes a bit of time but that's normal, definitely worth the wait and the different bacon they have is great. Very artistic and different! The bacon donuts are authentic, bacon bites are definitely better! The jalapeño bacon is my favorite and goes with most anything!"}
{"text":"I was really excited about eating here as I am crazy for bacon. That being said, I was disappointed with my visit. For a place that markets itself as a premier bacon spot, the bacon is average-at-best. While the bacon flavors offered were good, it was very thin and overcooked to a crisp. I'm okay with crispy bacon but not when you take a bite and it crumbles into small pieces. The hash browns I received were not only cold, they were over cooked with black burn char all over them. Our waitress was super nice but was covering a large section and we had to flag her down in order to get her to come to our table. Great idea, poor execution and we won't be back."}
{"text":"Oops we ate some of them before the pic. Can't resist the bacon ! OK I get it , bacon is good in everything. BUT really get the bacon flight, that's what I said bacon FLIGHT. Many thick cut bacon's , maple , pecan, jalapeno, just to name a few   I'm kind of ashamed to say that when my hubby got a call from work I couldn't stop myself from eating his portion.   They also have the best biscuits and gravy that I've ever tasted.  The Benedict is also good as well as the pancakes.  Good coffee too.  The service has always been great even when the place is packed.  Try to get there early if your going on the weekend, that's your best bet for not waiting a long time."}
{"text":"It was good, not the best or the worst - just good. I wouldn't mind going there again. My dad was disappointed by the bacon, seemed more like something you would pick up from the local grocery store."}
{"text":"Came here as a party of 2 on Saturday at 11:45am and was seated immediately. The server was at our table within 2 minutes. We attempted to order 1 maple bacon donut, however they were out. So we ordered 3 donut holes instead. They were as sugary and as sweet expected, and served warm.  We proceeded to order a vegetable omelette nix the cheddar and a Belgium Waffle.  The omelette was sizable as was the waffle, see pictures attached. I believe the waffle was slightly lacking in quality and would have appreciated a whole wheat option.  Overall, the food was good and the service was better. The atmosphere of the place was bustling."}
{"text":"Stopped into oink today had an awesome breakfast gailie(sorry if I'm spelling it wrong lol) was amazing just was very on top of her game made you feel welcomed and even felt like a close friend. The food was soooooooo good had the bacon benedict with hickory bacon and has browns. I would totally come here every weekend."}
{"text":"With a name like \"OINK\" how can you go wrong.  I went here last Friday after my ritual Squaw Peak morning hike.  The eggs benedict were great and the hash browns were extra crispy as ordered.   Excellent, attentive service and good food...I will return!"}
{"text":"Excellent food & service to match. Clean restaurant & bathrooms too....that says something!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the bacon flight, the coffee, the Oink French toast. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Io have been here3 times now and will continue to go back! I go in with my 20 month old son and they always give me the warmest welcome. Clean bathrooms and clean dining room every time I go in. Usually get the eggs Benedict and the holendaise sauce is super flavorful. Bacon iOS more crispy than I prefer but love that they offer a bacon flight. The apple cider bacon is my favorite. Being in the area my whole life, I have seen many places come and go from this location, I'm hoping this sticks around for a long time."}
{"text":"It's all about the bacon at The Oink Café. You have to try the bacon flight on your first visit, a serving of eight distinctively flavored slices of bacon. It's really the only way to know which bacon you like best. You can then select your favorite with any future breakfast entrée. The flight is also fun to share with friends. The only downside is that it essentially adds the cost of another breakfast to your tab.   Oink is very kid friendly, with a \"Little Piggies\" menu for them to color while you wait. The restaurant actually has a notebook full of completed \"Piggie\" masterpieces for you to browse through if you like. Or to which your little master can make an addition to it. There's also a small outdoor patio which is dog friendly.   The rest of the menu, outside of bacon, is solid enough. They have a diverse, yet pretty typical, assortment of breakfast offerings. Also burgers and sandwiches for lunch. The star, however, what makes Oink unique, is the bacon.  I understand this is one of just two locations, with the other being in Tucson."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast....this place is great. Our table had the French toast combo, an omelette, the Bacon Benedict (my favorite) and a flight of bacon (8 strips of different bacon flavors).  I had the Bacon Benedict with jalapeño bacon....incredible!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for breakfast or lunch in the area! Others have mentioned the noisey atmosphere, but I appreciate it since I have a little one that can be a bit on the noisey side herself and here she blends in.  I highly recommend stopping in on a week day for lunch if you are looking for it to be much quieter.  The manager is great. He is always working the room and stopping at tables to chat. The food is always great! If you are lucky enough to stop in when they have beer cheese soup it is a must to get. I have never had such delicious soup. A must try!"}
{"text":"My partner and I came here today on a whim and we had a great time. Our waitress was Josie and she was super fun and informative. She asked us numerous questions as to our preference, making it very personalized. We each had different Benedicts  (bacon and turkey) and we highly recommend it. Thanks for a great breakfast and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Loved the Oink Cafe!  My friend and I enjoyed a long breakfast, great food, great service.  I will go back for sure!  Lynn T"}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday morning for brunch. The place was packed but we waited only about 20 minutes. We ordered the Mac and Cheese with jalapeño and jalapeño bacon and the 50/50 burger. The Mac and cheese was delicious and perfect for sharing. The burger was amazing and had a great flavor, seemed like something every bacon lover would enjoy."}
{"text":"This place used to be good. It has gone down hill since they first opened, in my opinion. I could have just gone to IHOP across the street. There's not much bacon on the menu. The front area used to have a good display of deserts and bacon-infused food, but that's gone. I tried their donut made with bacon last time and that was yummy, that's why I returned but it's not a highlight anymore. I ordered the eggs benedict and it was blah...very dry. Hope to find another restaurant that really capitalize on the PIG...bacon especially. That's what the name OINK is, duh!!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a business lunch meeting. And it was perfect atmosphere; quiet and large tables to able us to review work. But besides that.....I can not say enough about their Macaroni & Cheese with jalapenos and jalapeno bacon! Yes, that is right JALAPENO BACON!! OMG!! This is the bomb!  I am definitely coming back for breakfast during the weekend. I spyed some killer looking drinks like the Bacon Bloody Mary!  So YUMMY!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service (Rachel K., Renin), great coffee & great breakfasts! Becoming my favorite breakfast destination."}
{"text":"Ventured here this Sunday morning not realizing it was the opening weekend; was told they had just opened on Tuesday.  That being said, they definitely have a few kinks to work out.    They prevented customers from using the door on Cactus as an entrance (understandable to help with the traffic flow) but there was no signage indicating where the other entrance door was located.  Not a biggie, but a little strange.  After finding the sole entrance door, entered to find people standing around and no customer greeter. No seating for those waiting to be seated.  Someone eventually walked around and wrote our name on a wait list.    The place is \"cozy\" with several tables and booths closely located.  The decor was simple but nice.  Loved the glass garage door which I'm sure they'll open during appropriate weather.  Also noticed they had outdoor patio seating as well.  Only waited 10-15 minutes for seating, which was pretty good considering how busy they were.  Here's where things start to fail...   I ordered the signature \"Oink Omelet\" and the other 2 in my party ordered the pancake combo. Not sure what was happening in the kitchen but they will definitely need to work on expediting.  The waitress was nice but not very attentive.  For example, we asked for straws several times to no avail.  A young lady from the culinary school providing samples of their baked items was kind enough to finally retrieve some straws.  The waitress, understandably, looked a bit overwhelmed.  From my seat, I would see into the kitchen and see that things were somewhat amiss.  After our orders were taken, we had to wait at least 45 minutes for the food to arrive. The \"Oink Omelet\" consisted of 5 (yes, 5) eggs, sausage, ham and cheese... hehehe.. definitely an \"oinker\" and came with hash browns (or home fries) and toast (or english muffin).  I have to admit that was a very tasty omelet.  However, the pancake combos were not very impressive and almost reminded me of IHOP or Denny's.  However, I was told the pancakes were somewhat tasty but could have been better and the applewood bacon was good.  After all is said and done, I would still give this place another try again after they have been open for a while and get the kinks out..."}
{"text":"Great food!!! I'm from the south and wad wanting a savory breakfast! I came to the right place. I had the pig in the blanket. Let me tell you, I can eeeeat however it was too much to finish. If I travel to Scottsdale again I will visit. 4 stars because I wish the dishes were paired With sides differently, IMO."}
{"text":"We had the Bacon Flight which was an awesome start. Then I had the Oink loaded French toast which was fantastic. Attentive service and not too long a wait to be seated today. Looking forward to my next visit already with a full and happy belly."}
{"text":"All I can say is YUMMMM! We wondered in here with not to many expectations... but the service was awesome, food was great, and prices very reasonable. We will be back!"}
{"text":"If you want a good breakfast in Phoenix don't go to the Oink Cafe. Go to the Butterfield Restaurant on 7388 E. Shea Blvd in Scottsdale, AZ about seven minutes away.  Had breakfast at the Oink Cafe got lousy service,  greasy link sausages and hash browns,  and mmisoma made with cheap Cupcake champagne. I had ordered patties sausages and got links. My wife ordered mmisoma so I asked for one too. Lucky the server forgot mines. My wife had barely drunk hers and offered me to taste it. The mmisoma was bitter due to the champagne. The server brought us our bill, first time returning after bringing our breakfast. I told her about the sausage, hash browns, mmisoma, etc. She spoke with her manager and took 10% off the bill. That was a joke! It was coded military/senior. I'll over 60 and look every bit. I was already entitled to a 10% discount. Just go to Butterfield Restaurant for a superb breakfast and fantastic service."}
{"text":"I love breakfast and really wanted to like this place. I ordered eggs and peppered bacon. Bacon was not impressive for a place that specoalizes in bacon,     the hash browns were under cooked and the toast was a bit burnt. My husband had the biscuits and gravy and it was bland. I also thought it was expensive. $ 2.50 for a cup of coffee. It was 3 of us and the check was $37 for a basic breakfast and a coffe. I will not go back. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Sadly, not the best breakfast.   The interior is very cute and they carry about their pig theme very tastefully (meaning the place isn't covered from head to toe pigs). Our waitress, Tammy, was extremely quick and friendly. And other waitstaff would buzz by with the coffee carafe for refills.  My husband's pancakes were undercooked in the center and had to be refired. I had the eggs Benedict. The sauce is extremely thick and a bit salty and the eggs were over poached and looked like hard little balls smothered in sauce. My applewood smocked bacon I ordered on the side was so hard it was difficult to eat.  But it's really the little details, like the not completely full chai tea and the discovery of dirty silverware rolled up in my napkin that leaves me with an ugh feeling.  Don't get me wrong, I was immediately brought new silverware, but the lack of attention to catch that before rolling it up in a napkin makes me wonder what else gets over looked.  I'll give it another try before completely washing my hands over it, but it is going to have to work a little harder to change my mind completely."}
{"text":"As my grandson says \"Oink is the happiest place on earth\"!  Great food and great service.  It's where to go to get a great breakfast in a hip & happening place.  Have you ever had bacon donut?  Have you ever had 8 favors of bacon?  This is the place.  The staff is friendly and efficient!"}
{"text":"Loved the Place! Everything Bacon! Try the Paradise Valley Omelette or the Eggs-Benedict...  its worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Great place. The bacon flight is a must try and good bloody Mary's. Friendly staff too"}
{"text":"Tried The Oink Cafe for the first time this morning, and we're glad we did.   We were seated promptly by a waitress in an extremely good mood. Noticed the other waitresses also seemed happy to be serving customers. Nice to see.   The menu isn't extensive, but has enough options to satisfy most anyone. They serve alcohol, which is nice for someone that wants a Bloody with their breakfast.   Food was hot and well done. The hash browns were crispy on the outside. After asking for \"crispy\" bacon, it was nice to actually receive crispy bacon. Too many places haven't figured out how to do that yet. Our Iced Teas were refilled without having to ask.   Even though places like Chompies have a lot to choose from and the food is good, I really enjoy smaller neighborhood or Mom and Pop places like Oink. Will definitely go back for breakfast and am curious to try them for lunch."}
{"text":"Staying at my sister's place while visiting the Valley for Thanksgiving, and of course she didn't have any food, certainly no breakfast grub.  Google Maps tells me that one of the nearest breakfast joints is Oink Cafe, and based on the name alone, I felt we should try it out.  Since it was a nice morning, my lady and I walked the relatively short distance to give it a shot.    It was a lot bigger than I expected, I guess I was picturing some little hole-in-the-wall with grease everywhere and some grumpy old lady slinging bacon everywhere in an effort to appease the hungry masses crammed into the place.  No, it was spacious and clean.  The menu was typical, except for the flight of bacon.  I love beer, and routinely get flights of beer when they are available, but I am not a huge fan of bacon and don't feel the need to try all 10 (or whatever) varieties of bacon this place has.  I'm sure plenty of people do, but I felt it was a silly novelty.    I ordered the chorizo and eggs, my lady had a ranchero omelet.  She ordered it without onions, it came out with hella onions, but the server was very friendly and attentive and took it back and it was quickly replaced with the correct version without the evil onions.  My fiancee also had a Bloody Mary (with bacon) and raved about it.  I don't dig on Bloody Mary's so I was unimpressed, but she said it was one of the best she's had in a long time.  My food was delicious, especially the side of jalapeno bacon I ordered.  Yeah, I know, I said I don't love bacon, but I figured I had to try one of the flavors.  Good God, the jalapeno bacon was incredible.  It was just the right amount of spice to liven up an otherwise drab piece of fatty meat.  It almost made wish that I had ordered the flight, just to see if the other flavors were as delicious.  Almost.    The service was friendly, quick, and attentive.  The atmosphere was a little bit stale because it lacked intimacy, but there is plenty of hand-colored pig art adorning the walls to occupy your time.  Overall, it was a very pleasant breakfast experience, much better than finishing off the stale box of cereal at my sister's place."}
{"text":"Brunch...not much can go wrong at a place called Oink.  Standard food, it was good and as expected.  I did quite enjoy their fruit compote as an alternative to syrup. Portions on what my family ordered were huge."}
{"text":"Good place to eat.  Don't be in a hurry. You will wait to be seated on Sunday mornings. Give this place a try . I'm sure that you will be back. Have a peaceful day."}
{"text":"If I could I wouldn't even give them one star. Waitress came out took our order. I ordered bacon and eggs and a bacon donut. My girlfriend ordered the paradise valley omelet. Our order was brought out by another waitress, I informed that waitress that I had also ordered the bacon donut and she just looked at me. For twenty minutes I repeatedly tried to flag down our waitress. To sum it up I finally got my donut when I asked for it as she brought the check.  So my bacon on the meal was barely cooked and the toast was burnt, no butter on the toast at all. I won't be returning to this place. If you have a chance,  pass. I'm sure the IHOP across the street would be a lot better."}
{"text":"So very tasty!  I had the paradise valley omelet with potatoes and I loved how crisp the home potatoes were, they were also well seasoned.  Don't remember much bacon in the omelet but still was yummy."}
{"text":"Our server wasn't as attentive to details as she should have been. Our order wasn't complete and one item was wrong, but since our server only took our order she could not know what the food runners brought us. We waited way too long for our bill to be returned to us once we gave her our CC. There was nothing spectacular about the food. I asked for hollandaise sauce for my omelet and paid $2.49 for about 2 tablespoons. I could get more flavor for less at Denny's. I expect better service for the prices."}
{"text":"First time here today!   Service was great! Our server was very chipper!  Clean and open atmosphere.   I enjoyed the bacon pancakes and home fries. Lots of food and super filling! Also sipped on a Cafe Mocha which hit the saturday morning spot!"}
{"text":"I always loved going into the oink. Your food is amazing! But the service was horrible. Kristen was rude, took forever to ring in our food, and bring us our tab. I then waited 15 mins to get my card back. I do not think i would come back into the oink."}
{"text":"I LOVE BACON!! So of course when I heard of this place, I couldn't wait to go. We got there and the greeting was lukewarm. We had to wait a little while before we were seated. Once we were seated it took quite awhile before anyone took our drink order. We had the bacon topped doughnut which I actually didn't expect to like. It was delicious!! Unfortunately, that is the only thing I can rave about. We ordered the bacon flight. At a placed called Oink, you would think the bacon would be exceptional; not so. It was over-cooked and thin :-(. My omelette was nothing special. It wasn't terrible, just something you can get at any breakfast chain. With a name like Oink, I thought I was going to have an exceptional breakfast experience. It was just mediocre at best and the service was not good at all. Definitely not worth going if you have to go out of your way to get there."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast with friends.  The french toast was overwhelming!  More than any one person should eat!  The bacon is the best in town.  Compares favorably with ihop across the street and would pick indy over a chain anytime.  Will go again if just to try the bacon doughnuts!"}
{"text":"Oink Cafe is a five minute drive for pick up. The food is great, I always have the Bacon Benedict. The lemon sauce is very mild, creamy and perfect with the seasoned bacon. The Husband has the Chicken Fried Steak. It is very, very good, but the biscuits are a little baking soda-y.  So switch it for english muffin instead. French Toast is fluffy and delicious and the turn around for orders is literally ten minutes for pick up. Overall, a great value,-- I've probably eaten here about 40 times in the last two years. Never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"- This is probably my go to breakfeast joint !! Any time i get a day off i love to come and eat here , the staff is extremely friendly and try to get you a seat asap , although there is a short wait, its absolutely worth it. Next time your raving some bacon or in the PV area make it a must & stop by the Oink Cafe. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"BACON! I thought the \"bacon flight\" was the greatest dish ever.  Eight pieces of perfectly cooked bacon, one each of: applewood smoked, sugar cured, honey cured, peppered, cherrywood, apple cider, hickory and jalapeno.  The bacon comes on a plate of lettuce, which as a bonus turns into a mini-salad with bacon flavored dressing, after you eat the bacon (at least it does, if you are a pig like me and my sister, no pun intended).  They also have a half-flight (four pieces of bacon, in flavors of your choice), but the full flight is so much better, IMO, especially the first time eating there.  EGGS! Besides the bacon flights, I'm also still in amazement over my scrambled egg. I really don't like eggs that much, so for me to LOVE a scrambled egg is just odd, and to crave a scrambled egg the way I crave a pumpkin frappe or a filet mignon is beyond bizarre.  However, that's how good the egg was.  I cannot stop thinking about it.  Yes - one silly little egg!!!  I suppose that my lack of egg expertise should be taken into consideration, as it is not my usual area of foodie-ness.  However, I may be a convert now after my encounter with the world's most perfect scrambled egg at Oink.  My mom ordered the yogurt parfait with granola and fruit.  I did not try it, but it was full of really big fruit, that was fresh, not runny, and the most amazing granola I have ever seen.  When I see giant, whole almonds crowning a tower of fluffy yogurt - I get a little happy.  Too many places give you watery yogurt, with powdery granola and mushy fruit.  But my mom ate the whole thing, so I am assuming it tasted as good as it looked.  SERVICE - so mostly good points and a possible negative point.  Our waitress was awesome - she even let me know that the bacon flavored coffee is more of a novelty, which most people try but don't usually ask for refills.  That was nice, since I wasn't in the mood for a novelty.  I ordered an almond latte instead (which was really good), and am going to try the bacon flavored coffee next time.  She also double checked that I said almond and not hazelnut, which I appreciated.  A lot of times people forget and just hope it turns out okay, rather than checking.    The only reason I mention a possible negative point, is because it is more of a relaxed environment, so if you are in a hurry or one of those moody people that expects a certain type of \"dining experience\" - make sure you sit at the counter I'm guessing.  It's definitely not a matter of \"bad\" service or \"slow\" service, or \"inattentive\" staff.....it is just a relaxed, happy, good mood sort of place.  Maybe I've been living in Boston for too long, if I am even making a note of this?  I cannot wait to go back this week, and try more of the menu.  Definitely a five star place."}
{"text":"What a find! This is an excellent place. Staff is friendly and quick. The food is unique and fresh. Eggs Benedict several different ways with perfectly poached eggs. Favorite breakfast and lunch place for now. Come on in!"}
{"text":"I took my son for breakfast as he's a big meat eater, and the name of the cafe alone piqued our interest. We went just after noon on Sunday. I ordered the standard fare of 2 eggs, hashbrowns, and biscuit with gravy, and of course applewood smoked bacon. Meh. Honestly, I think the problem was it was late in the day, nearly closing time, and it appeared that everything had been under warmers for a while. I'm not going to completely condemn the place until I go back early in the morning and see if I can get a fresh meal. I think the place has potential but my first outing was not so great.  My son had a burger (I don't remember which one) and he was pretty happy with that.  Oh, and as several have mentioned already, service was slow as molasses. Eggs, hashbrowns/bacon and biscuits/gravy don't take 30 minutes."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, it's close, convenient and it has different types of bacon.  It is because I wanted love it that it got 3 stars.    My guy and I stopped for breakfast Saturday morning, it took awhile to be seated but once we were the service wasn't bad for as busy as they were.  We both got eggs, hash browns, bacon and toast. I ordered my Applewood smoked bacon extra crispy, he ordered the jalapeno bacon not crispy.  This is where the stars began to fall.  It took forever for our food to arrive.  Several people who came in after us had their meals and were finished by the time ours arrived.  The hashbrowns were hot, the eggs warm and unfortunately his bacon was extra crispy and mine wasn't even close to crispy.    I don't mind the food mixup so much as the waiting.  We will give them another try and I will update then."}
{"text":"was there for the first time and my impression was very neutral. It is a cute place, was busy , but to the point it took way too long for the food, l think they had problems in the kitchen. The worst hashbrowns i had ever  eaten. The pancakes were ok.  They have a chance to be good, i hope they correct their problems and get good quality food."}
{"text":"Always has been a great place for food.  After a 10 mile run, I was famished.  The Arizona Omelette (Chorizo, Cheese, Avocado; substituted Salsa for Ranchero Sauce) hit the spot!  Great service, reasonable prices....I love this neighborhood spot!"}
{"text":"Decided to eat breakfast out, wife away and daughter at school.  this place is not to bad.  Came her with brother-in-law who loves all things bacon.  Menu was decent, but not an over abundance of options.  Service was fine for a Thursday morning.  Tried a few different bacon flavors and they were good, but nothing to make me come back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Food was ok, some of the bacon was above average. My husband got the pancakes, average. Son got French toast, basic white bread dipped in egg. I got a waffle which was actually very good. The wait staff was non existent. I waited 10 minutes for a water refill. When we gave our name we told them 2 and a high chair. The manager seated us and told us there were no high chairs- as we passed a table with 2, I told him we'd have to go elsewhere and magically there were plenty of highchairs. We ordered a bacon flight. I will say it was all good and cooked the right way- not some crunchy dog treat like some restaurants. I highly recommend the jalapeno bacon! With hickory and pecan wood tied for second. My husband was sure to have his card out when the wait staff appeared, we didn't know how long it would be if she had to make another trip."}
{"text":"As we had a near collision with a herd of javalinas last night while walking our dog, its kind of bitter sweet that this morning we came to the land of Oink!  Arrived around 9ish and easily asked for the open counter seats. Our server Mike was a doll and I ordered my usual 2 egg as I do every breakkie joint. Hash browns make or break it for me and I can't say that these were the best nor even average.   Thankfully i asked for extra crispy on the browns but still I felt no real spud taste. Scrambled eggs did save the day for me tho. And now to the bacon, my peppered was yum but a bit too thin cut for my taste. Also felt that the whole plate of food that  came out was not hot enuf to have been fresh off the line. So not sure of we'll be back as we have one of the best breakfast places 2 min from our place..."}
{"text":"The food was very good, but the service could use some work and organization. I'm definitely a person that's all about customer service and the hostess needs to be more personable and inviting. The older lady is more getting in the way than helping the situation. They need a restroom sign because I saw atleast five people almost walk in the kitchen.  Overall it's definitely a good start, just need to work out the kinks. I gave it four stars for the food and effort! Plus where do they get these stemless mimosa glasses!"}
{"text":"I just recently checked this place out and I fell in love with their applewood bacon and the chorizo scrambled eggs! The service was fabulous!!! My new favorite breakfast place! ;)"}
{"text":"A couple months back, a friend told us about this place. He raved about how delicious the bacon is. Being such obsessed fans of bacon we had to try it. The 30 minute drive there ended up being worth it.   We've been there twice now. Everything we've had there is really delicious. The big bacon omelette, the eggs benedict, the pancakes and even the bacon donut is to die for! You would think that with food quality this amazing, the service would be up to high standards, but I was let down.  The first time we went there, we had an excellent waitress. She was very sociable and definitely made our first visit there, one to remember. Our food came out in a blink of an eye and we just left there feeling this place couldn't go wrong. Today, it was entirely different. It took our waitress about 10-15 minutes to just grab our drink order. When we finally ordered, our drinks had ran and let me tell you, all we had was water. How hard is water to refill? Not that difficult. Our waitress paid more attention to a more larger group. Right before our food arrived, I ordered a mimosa. Let's just say that mimosa never arrived. She also ended up forgetting parts of my meal.   Even with this service, I would still go back. The food is too good to pass up forever I just hope that the service gets better. I know that people tend to forget, but when you're a waitress, it really isn't the best quality to have."}
{"text":"An absolute favorite for breakfast. Where else can you try a bacon flight with 8 different varieties made in-house and served on a pig-shaped platter? The BLT is outstanding. And don't forget the bacon donut to finish off the meal. Oink is a can't-miss if you want a unique breakfast experience...and lots of bacon!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. I ordered the pepper bacon and expected thick strips of bacon but instead I got 2 strips of thin, nearly meatless, bacon. Don't waste your time or $."}
{"text":"I had the Denver Omelet with a side of biscuits and gravy, wow, it was fantastic! They are very reasonably priced and the staff are all very friendly. You have to try this place."}
{"text":"I don't get how people are giving this place negative reviews, their food is very fresh and absolutely delicious! They cure their own bacon 8 different ways and offer a sampler dish. We tried 4 different kinds and they were all amazing. I had the eggs Benedict, and for the first time since I moved to Phoenix 15 years ago, actually got a properly poached egg. And the hollandaise tasted like it was made from scratch rather than some powder in a package. My husband ordered an omelet which he devoured, and seemed to thoroughly enjoy, I opted not to taste it since it was more spicy than I was in the mood for. We decided to top off our brunch with a maple bacon glazed doughnut which was still warm and made onsite, it was absolutely melt in your mouth delicious!  I will admit our over all meal was a little pricey, but I would eat there again in a heartbeat! Where else can you get  jalapeno bacon for breakfast?"}
{"text":"It could not possibly have been worse. Stay away from this place at all costs. Pity there isn't a zero stars option. I bet it won't be there in 12 months - just like everything else that has tried the same location in the past 20 years. Went there for breakfast last Sunday 3/25/12. It was half full. Ordered a vegetable omelet and a pancake. How hard is that? After 30 minutes I asked where the food was. Without checking, the waitress told me it would still be a few minutes as there 'were a lot of tickets in the kitchen'. In a half full restaurant after 30 minutes of waiting? One omelet? It gets worse .. much worse.  The chef came out to apologize. Told me that their system somehow was not entering the tickets of our waitress but that he would personally make it immediately. He didn't check my order with me.. remember it was lost. Amazing how two tables behind us got food from the same waitress. Their tickets did not get 'lost'. I know garbage when I hear it. He should just have been honest.,  Then the omelet came out  10 minutes later sans pancake (40 mins now).  I ate the slice of toast which was not toast but warm bread .. I hate that. The omelet looked peculiar and seemed burned.  Then I took a bite of the omelet and out popped a pink piece of ham. I was livid. It is completely against my religion and they had served me ham. I think they took the first omelet off the grill. He had no idea what my order was and did not ask. I screamed at the manager but I don't think he got it. I should have made a lot bigger scene but my wife stopped me. Take my advice .. stay away. Everybody complains about the service for a good reason.  Oink stands for a pig of a restaurant.  Let's hope Yelp lets this review stand."}
{"text":"We thought this was a great restaurant!  It's family-owned and verrry friendly.  We went on a Saturday for lunch.  We didn't have to wait at all for a table  Our waitress was Heather and she did an excellent job.  We're low carb and they were very accommodating to our needs (no bread, no potatoes).  I had a make-your-own omelette and my husband had the five egg omelette.  They use fresh, real eggs (not one of those powdered mixes).  They were delicious and filling.  We plan to go back, for sure!"}
{"text":"The French toast and the Belgian waffle are the best. Rachel took care of us and she is wonderful. Thank you, Rachel!"}
{"text":"This is another 3.5 rounded up to a 4. It gets the extra star because it's ranked rather low on Yelp right now. I'd avoided it before this for that reason, but one day decided to just take the plunge and check it out. After all, it specializes in bacon! Couldn't be that horrible, right?   It really is pretty decent. I went there on a Monday afternoon. The place was quiet- there were patrons, but I got seated right away. The wait staff were prompt, and my waitress was fabulous. Sweet and friendly and there with everything I needed. Very cute decor, they have that neat wood-looking tile all over, and the walls are BRIGHT chartreuse. I kid you not. Wear shades.   The menu itself is pretty simplistic. Don't expect anything revolutionary. It's got all the staples, benedicts, omelettes, chicken fried steak. I wound up going with their Denver omelette, subbing out the eggs for egg whites. They do allow you to get a pancake instead of toast. It's just one pancake, but I'm watching that waistline anyway. It was good. The Denver omelette had green peppers, spinach and bacon. Lots of bacon, they were super generous, which is awesome. The pancake was huge and fluffy- one was more than enough. They also have a drinks/cocktails menu, so I was able to indulge in a mimosa. Really nice, definitely appreciated that. They've even got a bacon bloody mary. I was tempted but stuck to my mimosa instead.  The last food item that I have to mention is their maple glazed bacon donut. Yes, you heard me right. Incredible. I brought it home for my husband and he inhaled it in foodgasmic delight. It's a deep fried cake donut with a maple glaze and tons of bacon. Tons. He gave me a bite- really quite good. So definitely get that!   All in all, a nice restaurant. I promised my husband I'd bring him back over when we can. It's not far from us, so we should be able to be by more often than some other brunch places I've reviewed.   Don't be put off by the low reviews. The service was good, the food was good, it really does deserve you stopping by at least once!"}
{"text":"Wow & Yummers......cute little place out by Paradise Valley Mall stumble across when I was visiting a Target over that way. Stopped in with my daughter we need to order breakfast obviously but we also ordered a sampler of the bacon can I say wow wow wow. I would most definitely recommend this place to anybody the service was great. We even took a sampler platter back home for my two sons to try and can I just say it was devoured really quick. and it's not your thin sliced bacon it's thick it's Hardy and its meaty not fatty."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to go.  Good food, love the omelets and of course the bacon.  Good coffee.  Service can depend on who's area you are seated in, but over all we haven't had a bad experience.  Make sure if you go at lunch that you order before any big groups, it can take a while."}
{"text":"Food is good but only if you're eating there. Out of the last three times I've ordered for pickup they forgot to place my order twice and only realized so when I got there, unapologetic at best."}
{"text":"Not worth the wait! 25 mins to be seated, food very basic. All meals and entrees whether breakfast or lunch are 10.49 For that much you would expect better quality and quantity. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Great food but terrible service. When we entered there were plenty of empty tables but the wait was 15-20 minutes and then people who came in behind us were seated before us.  It was a chaotic atmosphere and it seemed the hostesses were not able to control the demands of customers who wanted to be rude and just cut in line. It's a shame this overshadows the great food. Don't go when it's busy."}
{"text":"Just had the oink on Sun April 14 about 12 noon.  I had stopped since I have heard people talk and mention it.  I had read some reviews including on Yelp ranging from very good all the way to I'll never eat here as long as I live.  I just had to try it myself:  Appearance: 8/10 There are 2 ways to get in the place.  However, you can only get it one way to be seated.  The place was crowded including people who were eating outside.  The place looked very clean I thought  Friendliness 9/10 The crew was very nice and friendly.  Even heard a couple waiters (including mine) joke around with each other saying how one is more awesome than the other! :)  Wait time 5/10 My wait time was roughly around 20-25 minutes and this was at lunchtime on a weekend.  I have seen quite a few tables empty when I came in so I was confused as to why there had been a line  in the first place.  When you wait outside, they have benches you can sit on.  However, this may be a problem when it gets hot, especially in the phoenix summer.  In the inside,  there is just 1 single chair so more than likely you would be standing on your feet until you are seated.    Prices  5/10  I won't lie,  they are quite expensive.  I came in myself,  got a pop,  and a French Toast Combo (4 French toast, 2 sausages and 1 egg).  The bill came up to almost 13 bucks just for 1 person.  I don't think anything on the menu was anything less than 7 bucks.    Food 7/10 The food itself wasn't bad.  I actually got it within 5-10 minutes after ordering so it was warm when I got it.  It wasn't good but it wasn't bad either.  It didn't seem like much when you get it and I didn't feel totally full when I had left.     OVERALL 34/50  68% D+ Can't say I was impressed when I have read the reviews before coming here.  However, its not the worse place in the world either.  Maybe it was the name of the place that made me curious to try it for myself.  I would only go if you are already in the area (getting a haircut, going to Target/Dollar Tree, etc.) and just feel like trying it.   Then again, you got IHOP right across the street.  Remember they only serve breakfast and lunch so they close by 2 or 3 in the afternoon."}
{"text":"There was hardly anyone in the restaurant on 12/23/2013 and we waited 45 minutes for our food.  When it came out it was cold and the cheese was congealed on our sandwiches as it appeared it was kept under the heating lamp.  The waitress never removed our plates after the meal and we didn't receive our salads prior to the meal.  If you go here you have to be prepared to let your expectations of good service go. We heard about this joint from the food network prior to going and it didn't meet our exceptions on both food quality and service.  Sometimes I can overlook some food quality issues if the service is good but this place has neither."}
{"text":"This place has been on my radar to try for months and I'm so glad I finally went.  As soon as I saw bacon-topped glazed donut holes in their case I knew how my meal would start. They came out warm and crunchy, heaven on a plate. Not something you want to eat on a regular basis, but what a treat! With my cup of mocha coffee, I really could have stopped there but didn't...I wanted to try their bacon. They offer a ridiculous 8 varieties... even a flight lol!  I ordered the 2 eggs home fries and bacon. It was served with a delicious biscuit and the home fries came out exactly as I ordered them -- very well done and delicious. My sister loved her meal as well and even wants to return a second time while she's here. Who am I to deny her of that?"}
{"text":"This was the first breakfast place we tried after moving to our house and it did NOT disappoint. I think we made it our weekly go to and every time we have a guest or family come from out of town we take them here! If you like bacon, (which funny enough I don't) I hear from all my family and friends it's top notch and they have such a variety to try! I love walking over and sitting on their patio with my fur-baby and enjoying a nice breakfast and coffee! Staff is always so nice and never disappoints."}
{"text":"The concept is promising, the execution is disappointing. The interior lacks character. The placard on the table looked like someone just dashed it off on their inkjet printer and I can't recall for sure at this moment, but I'm pretty sure there were misspellings. It's as if they didn't have the funds to decorate or add all the little touches that identify the restaurant in the diner's mind. Overall it could use a graphic designer to do the menus and table cards. A visit with an imaginative friend to some store like Z Gallerie or Marshalls Home Store where you can get ready-made framed posters,  canvas prints and such could remedy the bland walls. This is a nice area, between Phoenix, Scottsdale and Paradise Valley. People expect a restaurant to have an identity. Your food has to be crazy good for people to want to return to a place which has all the character of a school cafeteria.  OK so who cares about my aesthetic sense; what about the food, right? Well I've only been there once (a 2nd trip planned shortly). My bacon flight was disappointing; a couple of the slices were overcooked and had the consistency of beef jerky. My dining partner's eggs benedict were well-done. That's bad. I talked to another friend who went here and they said the same thing happened to their eggs benedict. The service was OK. I'll give it another try but I doubt this is a place I'll want to make a regular stop. I think I gave it one star too many because  I just wanted so bad for it to be good.  UPDATE:  went here recently for a 2nd time. Better experience but I'm not changing the 3-star rating. The burgers were very good. The website menu and the physical menu show a discrepancy in the size of the Oink burger patty. The site says 1/3 lb (while all others are 1/2 lb), the menu says 1/2 lb. Pretty sure the actual burger was 1/2 lb. Waitress was a little slow refreshing the teas but she did do it and they were both very good. I hate it when I get stale icky iced tea at a restaurant. It is very inexpensive to keep fresh tea around. It's just water and a tea bag.  Unsolicited advice to the owner:  1) the concept needs better execution so that your restaurant's concept is 'sticky' in the mind of the diner. They remember it and go back.  a) the menus do not really sell the concept and are printed on plain old office paper on an inkjet printer. Hire or finagle a graphic designer to design new menus that better reflect the theme of the restaurant. If you don't want to go for professional-looking laminated menus, at least go to Kelly Paper and get a ream of heavy card stock to print them on so they don't look so cheap.  b) the walls need help.  2) The table card also needs a graphic designer's touch. What's more, I would not have assumed that a breakfast place - yes I know they serve lunch too but in my mind and most people's, it's a breakfast place - would serve booze yet that is what is on the card, the adult drinks. They have beer and wine and hard drinks too. Some people would like a Bloody Mary with breakfast, I bet they'd order one if you let them know it's available.  3) Speaking of Bloody Marys, did you know that there is bacon-flavored vodka? Why are you not pushing Oink Bloody Mary's or something like that? Missing the boat here.  4) If I were designing your menus, I would have on every page in big bold type: \"SAUSAGE SIZE IT! ADD BACON OR SAUSAGE TO ANY ITEM FOR $1/SLICE\" or something like that.  5) My friend raved about the bacon maple frosted donut. I did not see it anywhere on the menu. I had to ask the waitress and she said, \"oh it's there under 'donuts' on the back page'. All it said was , 'donuts' or whatever. THIS THING WAS ON THE COVER OF NEW TIMES!!! Why aren't you pimping the sht out of it? You might even have some other awesome donuts but you're not trying very hard to sell it to me."}
{"text":"We had been there for lunch a few months ago and it was average in service but high in price. We tried again yesterday for lunch. Arrived at 12:30, was seated right away and the place was busy with a good lunch/breakfast crowd. My ordered a Denver omelet with the home fries that were suppose to be with onions and bell peppers. I ordered a burger and sweet potato fries. Reasonable time passed and out came by burger no Denver omelet. They said it would be right out. My wife at some of my burger and I ate some too. The server came by said any minute now. Finally her Omelet arrived. My wife ask the server where are the bell peppers and onions on the potatoes? The server says, they are in the potatoes. My wife ask her to show her and the server picked through them and agreed, no bell peppers or onions. So, back to the kitchen. Why would one need to fight to get whats right? Meantime a man who i think was a floor MGR was cruising around not really doing anything. He finally came to our table after our bill arrived and ask how things were. My said below average and he said thank and come back again. NOT! My wife and agreed the next time any restaurant comes out of the kitchen with half the order, we are leaving. Its in-excusable."}
{"text":"I am giving this place a 1 star for one reason only.  I don't know if it is the lack of training or just not getting it.    Twice I've taken my 81 yr old mother who does not get around well to this place.  It's less than a mile from our house.  The first time there was a 20 min wait.  No biggie, there was a chair for her sit.  There were 5 groups ahead of us and a number of groups that came after.  We'd been waiting 10 min or so when a couple came in after everyone else and waited less than 5 mins.  The lady manager took them to a table that seats 4 that had just opened up.  You could tell this couple were regulars and a favorite of hers.  Two of the groups ahead of us were a group of 4 and a group of 5.  Those of us that were standing there couldn't believe it.  Everyone was annoyed, but didn't say anything - my mistake there.  Finally got seated.  It's a few weeks later and thought I would take mother and try one more time.  Get there and it's a 5 min wait.  No one waiting in front and and a few  people walking in behind us.  The young gal asks if we would like to sit at the counter and we say no, we would like a table.  Not one minute goes by, a young mother and her child come, and again all of us are passed over and they seat them at a table  that has just opened up and proceed to take us to a booth.  We very specifically had said table.  My mother has trouble in booths.  They coud have very well taken the mother and child to the booth.  I see that the lady manger knows the mother and is taking care of them.  WHAT THE???  My mother and I look at each other and decide this place isn't worth our money.  The hostess that seated us asks if everthing is okay and this time my mother says something.  The best the gal does is a hollow apology and not an offer of anything.  We're not the type of people to expect anything, but not even an offer after this stupidity?!  To be that rude and disrespectful twice, to not only us, but to the people who are also waiting is inexcusable.  It's a shame since all of the servers we have had are very good and I would give them 4 stars.  I'm done with this place.  Butterfields and U.S. Egg are MUCH better choices and worth driving to."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast today. The food was typical breakfast food. The bacon was good but not anything special. What really turned me off was Fox News playing on the tvs. Completely made me lose my appetite and shouldn't be on at a restaurant unless you know your only customers are idiots."}
{"text":"Good was amazing! Server was amazing also! We waited longer then the 30 minutes quoted and that wouldn't usually be a problem but they always had open tables and not seating them. They had a manager maybe even owner she was a women helping and she was super unprofessional and rude. She talked to the server while he was trying to seat us about what he was doing and also our server while she was trying to take an order about the tv. Super unprofessional. On top of that some people came in after us and sat at a empty dirty table outside. Instead of seating actual people on their list the manager or owner women came out and gave them menus knowing they had sat themselves. I won't be back for this reason. I am a paying customer who knows how to actually wait until my name is called and they allow others just to seat themselves. Also the women ridiculing the server and hostess in front of us was really uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I actually ended up here because it's right next to a Subway so I thought I'd give it a try. Plus I make an effort supporting small business. We've actually been there about 3 times.  Atmosphere wise, I really enjoy going there in the morning with my kids. The large windows let in a lot of light.   Service wise, never had an issue.  Food wise, it's alright. I'm not going to complain because it's not bad at all. I seem to always lean toward the Country Fried Steak and it's great. Their bacon? Not worth the extra cost."}
{"text":"I see that a lot of people think this place is great and I did love my BLT but the French toast was nothing to write home about. And I guess they were severely understaffed because I waited so long for sugar for my coffee that the coffee got cold. They did give me another coffee but not the sugar so I borrowed from a neighboring table. Probably not going to go there again...."}
{"text":"Finely some one gets the basic's right, All I want is a real good cup of coffee and for it to never stop while I'm eating ( always full and hot ) are soda also, Ya! The menu is simple and the staff did not mind me asking them a bunch of questions at are first and second visit. I ate your basic meal the first day Veggie Omelet and tried something new the second time,  (Eggs Benedict with home maid pulled pork, OMG it's my new favorite )  And guess what? they do one hell of a lunch, got a burger and took some home. yes that good and big, Wish they did dinner, I'd never eat at home again. The staff is great,  Ask for Rachelle and you'll love place even more ( so knowledgeable )  The manager comes around to see how your doing, that means a lot to me.  One suggestion: To The Oink Cafe, a loyalty type coupon/card or coupons for your next visit would be nice guys. Marketing 101, repeat customers will keep coming if you show them that they are valued.  I wish them good luck, and you'll probably see me there too"}
{"text":"Great food and bacon!  So many unusual but delicious sounding options on the menu!  This was my first time here and my entire family loved it!  Favorites were pork confit omelet, French toast, pork confit Benedict!  My 10 year loved her pig in the Blankets!  I am excited to come back soon!"}
{"text":"I went during the week with my two young children. We met a friend who also has a young child. Nice use of space. We didn't watch television, but it does have a few flat panel TVs that would be nice during football season on a weekend.  The space was child friendly - nice menu although they didn't offer crayons to kids, which they said they were in the process of incorporating.    Menu was huge and offered lots of traditional breakfast combinations. I had the waffle with eggs and sausage. I ordered the pigs in a blanket for my children. It is prepared with sausage that was fantastic. The perfect amount of spice and wrapped in pancakes that were also really good. My waffle was wonderful.  Really light and fluffy but with the perfect amount of crunch on the outside.  My friend ordered the French Toast, which was coated in captain crunch cereal (this sounds odd, but it was incredibly good and the bacon served with it balanced out the sweetness) and served with her choice of bacon. She ordered the applewood smoked bacon. It was excellent. They have five different types of bacon, including one infused with jalapeno, which I will try next time.   The service was a bit slow, but understandable given it was the first week of opening.  The staff was very friendly and attentive. I will definitely be back and would recommend to anyone for a nice neighborhood breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty decent.  I am with all of the other reviewers on the service aspect of this place.  It is SO unorganized here.  The people aren't mean to the customers but it's insane how chaotic it is at such a small establishment.  The old lady is weird and creepy.   There is a strange hostess table in the center of the restaurant that none of the signs tell you to go to.   I see a bunch of staff talking to each other and arguing. They all look so confused its sad.   I wish the restaurant impossible guy would come here and tell these people how to run a restaurant.   Again the food was tasty but the basic functionality customers expect restaurants to have is not there.   I hope they get help because it would be nice to see this place survive."}
{"text":"Oh how we looove Oink, you can get breakfast or lunch - I myself cannot pass up getting the traditional eggs benedict - So very good! My boyfriend on the other hand gets the healthy choice omelet and oatmeal. I will admit sometimes we have a stellar experience and sometimes its questionable. The little tables in the middle are really awkward with people walking by on both sides you almost feel in the way -we always wait for a table or booth. Overall one of our favorite spots."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! We tried the full bacon flight, Heuvos Rancheros, Arizona omelette, and bacon donut holes. Everything was delicious, service was great. Cute restaurant concept...because everything is better with bacon!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and service is generally decent, the food is consistent (decent). Nothing really terrible but nothing to write home about either. I would probably recommend other spots for breakfast if asked, but I do like the lunch here.. But as others have mentioned, bland. I like the mimosa and Bloody Mary flights. They have many different flavors for lattes which is nice too. Usually you don't have to wait long to get a table. Nice concept with bacon flights, but I think they all generally taste the same.  Average spot, maybe a step up from IHOP/ Denny's"}
{"text":"Finally made it to Oink this past weekend.  The menu is what you'd expect from a breakfast spot but their specialty is the bacon.  They have 8 different types to choose from and you can order a \"flight\" of them to sample them all.  We passed on that but I did order the AZ Omelette and was impressed.  Service was good for us so I'm not sure about all of the negative reviews on that.  Coffee was kept topped off and the owner/manager stopped by to chat us up for a bit.  Well run establishment."}
{"text":"What a fun breakfast experience.  Not a typical \"cookie cutter\" breakfast joint.  Nice variety on the menu and the bacon...oh my, the bacon. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Service has gotten better since opening week, thank goodness. Still not perfect but we will keep trying."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant with a quirky name. The staff was super friendly & food delicious. I ordered the Oink French Toast combo & just had yo try the bacon. Yum!!! They have 8 different kinds of bacon to choose from but I stuck with Applewood Smoked which had a more authentic flavor than I'm used to... like it was actually smoked here, on site! By far the best I've ever eaten. The French toast with ample strawberries & blueberries was equally delicious & also one of the best in town.   I look forward to coming back again & again as I try everything on their menu. The value & quality of the food here is top notch!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service not so much. Maybe the waitress was just having a bad day.  We bought a coupon pack from a neighbor selling them to support his high school football team so we will go check it out another three or four times.  If the service stays bad I'll have to change the review I'll have to change the review to 3 stars because there's plenty of places to get good food it he area.  We will see:)"}
{"text":"Awesome won't disappoint. Best Benedict's and bacon combinations. Awesome French toast too. One of the best breakfast in town. Got to try the bacon flight and bloody Mary's"}
{"text":"Delicious, quick, service is great, the bacon is real, and the barbecue sauce is honestly the best I've ever had...ever. They make it in house. They need to sell the stuff."}
{"text":"Don't judge this place from the outside, it is really bigger than you think. They do not take reservations for party's less than 5. On the weekends it gets pretty busy so be prepared to wait if there is just 2.  This is our 2nd time here and even though we had to wait it was not too bad. You can get your coffee or other drink while you wait but I highly recommend getting a maple bacon covered donut or donut bite. Makes any amount of waiting seem worth it!!  On this visit we ordered the Pork Confit Omelette and AZ omelette. Both had their ranchero sauce on top of the omelets but it was best on the AZ.    The atmosphere is busy but still enjoyable and they have a great outdoor eating area. We will be back as the location to stores makes it easy for us to stop & grab a bite!"}
{"text":"This place was very nice and people love it, as you'll see if you come on the weekends. The place was packed. We waited over 40 min for a table; however, the wait was worth it, because the food was awesome.  I was a little disappointed in the bloodys. I was so excited to get one, and it ended up being a little boring. But, then again, I'm into super spicy bloodys with homemade mix, so maybe I'm just a bloody snob.  Overall, I thought it was all a little spendy, but it's worth the trip and the bill for a cute breakfast place with great food."}
{"text":"The food was very taste. The staff was friendly and the manager made sure to make sure we were happy. We got the oink plate (8 pieces of bacon) and some didn't have enough flavor for me to distinguish the difference, but still yummy. The applewood bacon and jalapeño bacon are the best!"}
{"text":"This was a huge letdown! After seeing the menu and reading the reviews, we had high hopes for this restaurant.  Upon arrival, we were not greeted. We waited for almost ten minutes to be seated while the hostess was wrapping silverware instead of seating customers. When we were finally seated, they took our drink order and we waited for at least 10 minutes before we were allowed to order. We asked someone who walked by if she would take our order and she said \"Your waitress will be over soon.\" So we waited...and waited...  At last, we were able to place our order. We ordered a chicken wrap, a pulled pork sandwich, chicken fried steak, and the California Mac and cheese. With the chicken fried steak, I order Mac and cheese on the side. Which I was assured would be the best Mac and cheese I'd ever eaten...needless to say, it wasn't (but I'll get to that later). Thus began the long process of waiting for our food.   We waited for (no exaggeration) 45 minutes for our food to come. During that 45 minutes our water and tea was only refilled once--when we told the waitress we were ready to walk out. After she assured us it would be 5 more minutes for food, we decided to give it a chance--we were invested at this point.  Then our food came... Firstly, the wrap had onion (which was not something we were told it came with) and the chicken was very cold. Second, the chicken fried steak came with a biscuit--according to the menu--but we had to ask for it to get it. Thirdly, the Mac and cheese I promised I'd tell you about: it was dry, cold, and tasted like it'd been under a heating lamp while the rest of the food was being made.  Let's just say, we will not return!"}
{"text":"After eating at the place couple of times, I'd figure to write a review on this place.  Overall this place is pretty good for breakfast.  The food was pretty good, but our service every time is pretty slow.  I usually get standard breakfast, eggs, sausage, and hashbrown.  I also have tried their biscuits and gravy.  All were pretty good.  My girlfriend is a huge fan of bacon and really enjoys the different types of bacon.  All and All, this place is pretty good.  It gets pretty busy in the morning, so expect a little wait."}
{"text":"Ok so I have had some good and some bad.  The last couple times were not so good.  The food is good and the restaurant is clean but you gotta get better wait staff.  They tend to be disorganized and forget things.  There seems to always be confusion on who's table it is.  The biggest thing though... Stop with the gossiping!! I really don't need to hear about your personal and work problems as I eat.  Serving 101 tells you not to complain and gossip anywhere near ear shot of the guest.  It would be really easy for me to give this place 4 stars if it was more consistent. Undercooked eggs one time, perfect eggs the next etc"}
{"text":"If you want a good, big breakfast this is the place. I've had every one of their omelets and liked or loved each one. When they first opened the service was good and the staff was friendly. The past 6 times visits the service got progressively worse. The past 2 trips were especially bad. I only got 3 cups of coffee because our waitress disappeared. We won't go back because the service was so bad. Again the food is great but the horrible service will keep us away."}
{"text":"We have now been to this cute little cafe twice. The first time our service was beyond slow and orders all screwed up but they made it right. Our waitress was working her butt off and gave us free muffins (which were delish) while we waited. We ended up getting two free meals for our troubles. The second visit was much better and the food came at a reasonable time. I think they're just working out the kinks since they're new.   Pros: The food is really good and they're pastries looked awesome. My kids loved the mini coloring books and were given a free cookie. The bacon was delicious. Friendly atmosphere and the staff is trying.   Cons: long wait and slow kitchen but I think they're trying and improving.   Hope this place succeeds! The food is worth it."}
{"text":"Super nice staff. My latte was barely warm and not much to wrote home about. The bacon donut was good. Like pancakes and bacon had a baby!"}
{"text":"Consistent. This place delivers a great product every single time I'm here. The eggs are always cooked perfectly, and I love that! The wait on the weekend can get long so get there early. They only take reservations for 6 or more.  They have a cute patio that allows dogs, but I normally end up sitting inside at a booth. The service is very friendly and they remember us every time we come in. They have an awesome Oink Bloody Mary, that includes a strip of your choice of bacon (they have 7 kinds). The mimosas are nice and refreshing too. I normally order the Pancake Combo, now i do not traditionally like pancakes or sweets at all, but they do them right here. I always have them add fresh blueberries, YUM! It comes with that perfectly cooked egg and the meat of your choice. I really like the sugar cured or jalapeno bacon. The Bacon is not very thick and could be a little more impressive since that is the whole theme of the restaurant, but its still good.  I have also ordered the Pigs in a Blanket. The portion is huge! It is three full sized pancakes (with blueberries for me) stuffed with a sausage link, served with your choice of potato.  I really like the people and food here... check it out."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now... Wait times are kinda long, but once you get seated they do a good job of either filling up your drinks or dropping off a pitcher so you can refill yourself.  Food was good and worth going back to try something else."}
{"text":"First time going and very disappointed. Got in quickly. Waitress was quick with placing the order and very friendly but we waited for our food for about 45 min. Looked good but didn't taste good. I ordered the biscuits and gravy. Biscuits were so hard and not eatable. Gravy was ok. Ordered a chocolate latte and charged $1.50 for the chocolate on top of the latte price $3.29. Walked out very disappointed. Never going back."}
{"text":"I love oink cafe!! I've been there many times and always had amazing service and great servers. I have also suggested this breakfast place to several of my friends who love it also. The service is always very quick and the food amazing this is my weekend breakfast place for sure!"}
{"text":"I've never been here but it sure was good. Be prepared to be filled. Wow. Busy place. Really love their good and the bacon was amazing. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Phoenix and some friends insisted that we stop & try the 'Flight of Bacon'.  We did, and sadly we were 'underwhelmed'.  Service was good, but I thought the Flight was just over-hyped (and overpriced)."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful breakfast today.  Pecan wood smoked bacon, eggs and a biscuit.  Next time I want to try the bacon sampler platter.  I must have seen 10 of them go out today while e were there."}
{"text":"Everthing we had was good. Service took A LONG time. The food could be hotter (temp.) ours was just warm. I love the unique bacons you can choose. It is a little pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Service was prompt but the food wasn't all that. The sandwiches are plain and the orange juice came warm. Most likely wouldn't return because of there wasn't any flavor. Their sweet potato fries were pretty bomb though, I have to give them that."}
{"text":"I took my staff here thinking it was going to be a good place. The food was awful! The biscuits were so hard we could not eat them. The English muffins were also hard. The bacon was nothing special and we could not taste the different types. I was really disappointed and hoped it was better. It was also pretty expensive. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great brunch or breakfast place. Went with husband and kids and they loved it, I had their battered French toast, which has a unique sweet crunch to it, and their bacon is flawless. Last time I went I got a veggie omelette. It was good, but I wish there were other types of veggies to add to set it apart from a general veggie omelette. It was still very good, just one of the very few menu items that was not unique. The bakery also is stellar."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Especially the \"oink\". Did not sample all the bacon flavors but did enjoy the one I tried, apple wood.  Wife could not consume all her biscuits and gravy, even with helping her do so.  Yes that was yummy as well.  Thank goodness for \"doggy bags\" . Wasn't too busy it seemed, but did have to request a re-fill even  when a server passed our table with a pot in her hand. Found it a bit pricey, but what isn't these days."}
{"text":"Had the bacon tray, who knew there were 8 different types of bacon.  I made a pig out of myself.   I just pigged out."}
{"text":"So I have smelled this place a lot because I work in this plaza. I stopped here on a Saturday morning and sat at the coffee bar outside. Right away the window opened and my friendly waitress greeted me. The menus are kind of like place mats outside. Very straight forward with yummy options. I was impressed to see that they has a flight of bacon as a menu option. 8 different bacons as a meal choice?! I ultimately chose the pork confit Benedict. It was delicious. The shredded pork was so tender. It melted in my mouth as I chewed. I enjoyed the hollandaise sauce as well, thick and creamy. I had a side option of fruit, hash browns or home fries. I got the hash browns. No complaint there! Really good breakfast place. I can't decide if I want pigs in a blanket or an omelet for next time!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a couple of times and will continue to go back.  The service has been great both times.  The first time there were very few customers and we received the food very quickly.  I had an omelet, which wasn't my favorite but still good.  The next time I ordered the huevos rancheros, which was really good.  The service was quite slow and you could see most of the servers standing around, but I had time to spend so I didn't mind. Its a good place to eat."}
{"text":"All the staff are friendly and seem to genuinely enjoy their jobs. Rachel is awesome! The food is good, too! Get the Flight of Bacon to sample all the flavors!"}
{"text":"If you are a BACON fan, this is your place.  The Spicy Bloody Mary is great. The peppered bacon was good.  The Oink Benedict was really good and is served with slices of bacon on it.  I ordered it with cottage cheese as the side. The portion was average but not huge. Service were very good, attentive, and perceptive. We ordered a plate with four additional slices of bacon to sample the applewood smoked and the peppered bacon. The bacon is served crispy but not to the point of breaking when picked up. I thought they did a nice job all the way around. Went at 9:30 AM on a saturday and were seated right away.  Mostly full at that time."}
{"text":"Exceptional service. Rachael was our waitress and she was on the ball. It was a packed house but we were seated quickly. Nice patio seating area. We had the traditional eggs Benedict and their specialty French toast. The specialty French toast had fresh berries, strawberries, fresh cream and it was to die for. I will come back just for that over and over again."}
{"text":"OMG! Mimosa, Bloody Mary and bacon flights - need I say more??? Reasonably priced, all dishes delicious, options for all spectrums from healthy to all bacon everything. Great service that accommodated my toddlers picky eating and \"all grapes\" diet. I've found my new favorite spot!!"}
{"text":"The food is great here. It's small and a bit noisy but that's if your used to it. Over all great service and food i will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Excellent choice if you want a good hearty breakfast. Don't come here to eat healthy, there are too many yummy distractions. Had the eggs benedict and a side of pancakes that were tasty and very filling!!"}
{"text":"great spot for breakfast or lunch...nice staff....bacon lovers paradise!!  Mike"}
{"text":"Bacon, eggs, home fries...simple, they cannot mess this up.      But two short, small slices of bacon?  Bacon should be three thick slices at least, especially if your business is called Oink!  Eggs were fine, but cold tiny cubed potatoes?    This is worth $8.49?  I am disappointed by Yelpers leading me here.   A waste of time and money.   Go to Perk and get a real breakfast."}
{"text":"To me, it doesn't matter that we didn't have a full breakfast here. Oink warrants 4 stars simply because they have 8 types of bacon and they are all delicious.  Plus: great service and a dog friendly patio!  We look forward to returning to enjoy an actual breakfast, but until then, come here if you like bacon. Oink!"}
{"text":"Ate here last Sunday for brunch... They were busy but screwed up our order not once, not twice but 3 times. Never did get what we ordered. Then they brought the check before we even got our food. Tried to stand behind their mistakes but did a half hearted effort by only comping my wife's meal not to include her drink and offering to give her a free meal if she came back... Nice but they screwed up everyone's meal and drinks at the table at least once, we all  got our meals at different times. Screwed up our drink order. And then the manager blamed it on the owner for being on vacation.. Really? It took 1 hour 40 minutes to get our food and it was wrong and cold. Should have Comped the whole table and I don't want to hear excuses from the manager! Epic Fail... To many other places to brunch on Sunday... Won't go back even though they did offer a free meal. You only get one first impression.."}
{"text":"Underwhelming. It was a decent, basic breakfast. Nothing special. The bacon board was kind of sad looking with 4 shriveled pieces of bacon on a giant plastic cutting board."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but unfortunately it doesn't live up to expectations. With a name like Oink you'd think they would get really creative but other than offering several eight types of bacon and maple glazed bacon donuts, they don't really seem to do all that much with it.   We ordered the bacon flight to sample all of the different types and then our individual meals. I had the 50/50 burger which is described as 1/2 ground bacon and 1/2 ground beef. It was good, but the bacon flavor wasn't nearly as tasty as I expected. My wife had two eggs and bacon which also came with hashbrowns. She noted that the hashbrowns were boring and the eggs and bacon weren't any better than other breakfast places. My kids ate pancakes and pigs in a blanket off of the kid's menu which didn't seem to include any specialty bacon offerings.  As stated, for a place that claims to specialize in pork products, there really didn't seem to be many. For a start, how about pork belly, bacon-flavored hot chocolate, or even just the ability to order a plate of a specific type of bacon. Yes, the bacon flight is nice but the presentation was lacking, basically just 8 strips on a plate. I'm sure a creative chef could come up with even more ideas.Right now Oink has a good name but they definitely need to work on the execution."}
{"text":"Bacon cooked perfectly. Eggs cooked perfect. I ordered the bacon Benedict and I always ask for the eggs to be cooked well. Awesome Bacon Bloody Mary! Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and service has always been good, but the food is inconsistent. I was here a few days ago and the server was excellent (never let my coffee run out!), my French toast was good, but the bacon was SO disappointing! It had zero flavor and looked like they had taken one piece and sliced it in half. They were 2 flimsy, skinny slices that looked like they came from a fast food place. I couldn't believe it. After the disappointment of this last visit I probably won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I saw several health code violations in the 45 min I had the misfortune to eat here. Our waitress used a dirty glass to scoop ice out of the ice bin. The cook came out with his gloves on to speak to the table next to us, touched the table and walked right back into the kitchen. The waitress greeted our table with an armload full of dirty dishes. The bathroom was dirty, with no paper, and hadn't been checked (by the chart on the door) in 5 hours. This all on top of slow and rude staff made the visit not worth it. Entirely different from the same place in Tucson."}
{"text":"I have to agree with many of the other reviewers, food is good but the service is bad. The person in charge of the servers has got to be the problem.  I witnessed other tables having service issues. Lousy manager and/or lousy training program.  Won't last with that kind of program."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a negative star or none at all I would. First off the food is mediocre at best, and they put less effort into their customer service than I did writing this review."}
{"text":"I've been eagerly awaiting a good time to try this place out because, well, BACON! It's got a nice layout and the wait staff was extremely friendly. When I go to a place for breakfast one of the key factors to a good experience is if the wait staff can keep my coffee cup filled. Yeah for Autumn, our server. She did this for our whole table. I honestly could not decide on what to get so I told her to \"Surprise me\". Sometimes not a good idea, but I was pleasantly surprised. I was served the breakfast burger. Big hunk of meat and cheese with pepper bacon on a wheat bun. I was impressed at it's size however they forgot the egg on the burger and brought it on a separate plate a minute later. One of our party tried the \"flight\" of bacon and stated it was pretty good. I tried a piece of the Applewood and I liked it better than the pepper.   So my overall impression of Oink Café was good but not over the top. Forgetting an ingredient on a menu item is a no-no in any restaurant but I am glad they brought it. I would have never known. The coffee was good and the servers excellent. A little on the pricey side for breakfast for my taste. Over $80 for 5 of us. I'd like to go back and try lunch. Maybe I will do that soon."}
{"text":"Unique place! Great service. Had the chicken salad...YUM! Topped off with a bacon donut....different."}
{"text":"The last time I was here we had a big group and so the slower service made sense. But today it's just me and my friend. We asked if the bar was open seating and they said no. The hostess passed us over because she can't confirm what she heard.  In the meantime people just walked up and sat at the bar. Great....so we did the same. The problem is understaffing and mis-staffing. The bar guy is responsible for so much that he's super busy but others are standing around laughing, not rushing and most importantly not helping out. The food was decent but nothing special. The bacon of course is outstanding but the little things are missed."}
{"text":"I went  to Oink Cafe for the first time to have breakfast today at 10AM (on a Sunday) and it was really disappointing.   I shared 2 entrees and tried the bacon donut holes; while the flavor was good they were so dry that we didn't care much for them.   We shared the waffle combo and the paradise valley omelet with hash browns and a biscuit, this biscuit was dry, cold, and hard. The omelet was also dry and had clearly been under a warmer of some kind.  Hash browns were decent but nothing special. We chose this place because of the bacon and it was also disappointing.   For delicious pepper bacon, try Matt's Big Breakfast in downtown Phoenix. No comparison.   It was really surprising that during what should be a time to be rushing to fill orders, our food was not fresh at all.   My sister didn't ever receive part of her meal and then we had an extra beverage added to the check. The service was slow and scattered and there was no toilet paper in the women's restroom.   I won't be returning."}
{"text":"We had a great late lunch last week at Oink. Arrived about 30 minutes before their 2:00 closing but that made no difference. Our server, Suzie was wonderful.  Oink burger was HUGE, cooked to perfection topped with cheese, bacon (of course!) lettuce and tomato and served with a ridiculous amount of fries. My chicken wrap was amazing! We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Patience required. We go on Sundays and usually get there around 8:30am. Typically the wait is about 15 minutes. My favorite so far is the Oink Breakfast Burger and the Sweet Potato Fries. The service is usually slow. It's a very busy place and I'm an understanding person so it doesn't really bother me much but for someone in a rush it's probably not going to be a good choice for you. Good luck getting a refill on your water. My husband ordered the steak and eggs last time and he asked for his steak to be cooked medium well. When he got it the steak was more like medium rare...super pink and undercooked. So he was upset about that. The manager did offer to bring him a new dish, so that was nice.  Main reason we keep coming back is that we live so close. It's a decent breakfast, definitely better than Denny's."}
{"text":"My go to spot for sweet and savory breakfast. You can't beat their French Toast paired with one of the many bacon flavors. Bacon is obviously king at Oink and the jalapeno bacon is great. Once we went and they had a mango habanero bacon that was some of the best bacon I've ever eaten. If you're in the area and in the mood for some amazing pancakes, delicious french toast, or a phenomenal waffle, I highly recommend you stop by."}
{"text":"We waited 45 minutes for our food to arrive and our waitress wouldn't even come to our table to get our check when we were finished. We had to go inside to find someone to pay. They only took $5 off our bill!! Totally ridiculous to wait this long for eggs with no apology from our waitress!!! The manager was nice and the food was decent but very annoyed at this experience!"}
{"text":"Wish I could comment on the food. 45 min wait. Never got seated as we were skipped several times. My wife and I didn't want to be crammed standing inside so we chose to sit outside in the heat.The staff is too lazy to check to see if people were waiting outside hence why we got skipped. Ended up walking out and they could have cared less. Got a lame ass sorry and that was it. Probably for the best. The place looked dirty anyways. Too many other clean and great places to eat that have far better customer service in the area."}
{"text":"I have been a years long fan of oink. The food is always amazing and the poached eggs are done to perfection. The crispest of bacon in SO many flavors! The service and management are super friendly and always remember me. I just recently had an issue with my check and they handled it with grace and a smile! This will continue to be one of my favorite places!!!! Way to go Oink!!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for drinks only but the Bloody Mary flight was outstanding and the prices and serve matched the drinks.  Next time we will go for the bacon flight."}
{"text":"Tried out Oink Cafe for the first time today and really wanted to love it but it started off bad with our 20 minute wait turning into atleast a 40min. There were countless numbers of tables open during our wait time. When asked when we'd be called the lady said they'd already seated us, someone took our table! They immediately sat us. Our server was fabulous and food was good but wait time for the food was a little ridiculous. The poor servers are inundated with not only serving their tables but making their own drinks... this takes away from their tables and makes the wait that much longer. The organization seems to lack. Someone needs to help with hostess, check in's and calling people to their seats, they need to hire a drink maker. Hopefully we can give it a try again but not looking good."}
{"text":"The service was friendly but VERY poor.  We had to ask for water 4 times.  My friend ordered the Southwest omelette scrambled.  I created my own egg white scramble with spinach, tomato, jalapeno, pepper jack cheese and avocado.  We both ordered wheat toast and hash browns well done.  A different waiter brought us our breakfast. His was an omelet not scrambled but ate it anyway.  My was egg omelet not egg white scrambled no avocado, raw hash browns and no toast.  We sent it back but before we received it our original waiter brought us the check without checking on us and made a comment how I ate mine pretty fast.  The order came out again without the avocado, wheat toast and no jelly.  We had to ask twice for the bacon donut  holes (Yum!) which he finally brought but seemed a little confused as to what exactly they were.  He did have the manager remove our two Bloody Mary's.  We did noticed two other tables that this waiter had also had problems.  We will try this place again as the food was pretty good once we got it but hopefully we will get the right food at the same time and better service."}
{"text":"Food isn't that good and service was horrible. Very slow, server forgot to put in my entire order with the other orders at my table."}
{"text":"Wow. Just amazingly wow.   Located next to Paradise Valley Mall in the target strip mall is a little gem known as oink.  The signs walking up are descriptive and making me salivate for the bacon before I even walk in the door.  Looking at the menu I see there are several different bacon options and even a \"flight\" of bacon!!! Now most of us over 21 know a flight as a beer sampler with 4 or 5 different beers. But a Bacon flight... genius.   So after a mad cackling fit over the bacon flight I decide at 9am I must try the 50/50 burger. 50% ground beef and 50% ground bacon. Med is the lowest they will cook it due to the pork. Ok no problem. It comes out and I'm immediately drooling. Take a bite and I'm in heaven.  I ate half and was full. Took the other half for my 21 year old to have with his lunch. While I was sad the beautiful bacon aroma had left the car, I am happy to say I am still stuffed hours later.    I can't wait to return and try something else new."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Staff is always friendly and the food is always good. This is one of our go to places when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I've been to Oink a couple of times .... and I really hope it pulls through and makes it.    It's in a location where 'The Eggery' was in Paradise Valley for a long, long time and they were very busy and successful.  Several places have come and gone since then... and for some reason, I'm really routing for Oink, but they have a lot of work to do.   The parking is not exactly the best.   I would HIGHLY recommend you park in the EAST parking lot rather than the SOUTH.   If you enter from the south entrance, you have to walk all the way to the back (er, um, front?) of the restaurant to only walk back where you came from to be seated.  A little awkward, but I didn't learn my lesson from the first time I was there.     There is a cute little patio area that I hope they utilize someday... love sitting outside!    The restaurant atmosphere is a little sparse, but since it's just starting out, I hope they add more to the decor- because I love nice ambiance.   Right now it's bland and boring.     The food is great!  My co-workers enjoyed piled high sandwiches and build your own omlettes which they really liked.  I've tried their bacon cheeseburger, which was so good the first time, that I ordered it again.  Yes, I'm boring.   I also ejoyed their sweet potato fries.  If you're going to try this place... be sure to go with a huge dose of patience.  These girls are REALLY trying to get it right.  They are very pleasant, but I just don't think they've gotten their groove yet on service.      Ladies, work smarter, not harder.  For instance, grab silverware when you grab the menus, so you're not back and forth and running over yourself.    Maybe even have a service station closer to the back (er, um, front?) of the restaurant.  It's a long jaunt back and forth.   Anyways, I wish you the best of luck.  It has a great food with great potential!"}
{"text":"Damn. If we truly are what we eat, I'm in trouble.  Anyone that reads my reviews knows I hold Matt's Big Breakfast at the top tier of breakfast places. Every time I go to Matt's I get friendly service and PERFECT breakfast...and they are the only place in the Valley that get's the 5 stars for breakfast (at least in my book).   That being said, we have been to Oink Cafe a few times and are impressed.   This is a bacon place. They have about 8 different kinds of bacon, and all are really yummy.   The Omelettes are pretty damned good, I have to say. The Country Potatoe's are really good, as well. The egg and meat (think bacon) dishes are very good.   So, if you can't make it to Matt's, come here. They're on to something, and it's very, very good."}
{"text":"Food always good here & servers are friendly but I wish they had a someone to buss tables. Seems like the servers can't keep up with it any time I'm here. It's gross walking by dirty table after dirty table. This would detract from a 4 star review but my server was so nice I had to up from 3 to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Nice place to get some Breakfast or Lunch in the PV Mall area. Inside is somewhat simple with the basic PIG theme (Oink). They have both booths and tables that you can request. Gets really busy and you will probably have to wait a bit. So get there a little early and get your name on the list. We went shopping next door and got back right when they called our name. Perfect timing.  The menu has a large selection of most of your favorite breakfast dishes as well as a lunch menu with burgers and sandwiches. They also serve soup, an array of salads, oatmeal, yogurt with granola, mac and cheese, chicken, fish and chips, and even chicken fried steak.  Today my Yelp friend and I did the breakfast dance. I ordered the The OINK Omelette which has 5 eggs and is stuffed with a bunch of the meat group covered with cheddar cheese. Had to try a side of the Half Flight of Bacon which is 4 out of the 8 choices of flavored Bacon strips and a side of what they call ranchero sauce for my omelette.  Our server Cheyenne was both friendly and most accommodating even though the restaurant was totally packed. She made sure that we had everything we needed and then some.  The food was tasty yet somewhat average and the bacon was a little pricey. Would have liked a thicker cut of the Bacon as well as it being cooked a little slower to prevent shrinkage. After all it is served on a butcher block. Thick BABY! The Omelette was tasty and quite filling. What they call ranchero sauce is really more of a New Mexico style enchilada sauce. Ranchero sauce is usually more of a fresh sauce cooked with tomatoes, onion, peppers, garlic and herbs. I bet their version would taste great on one of their burrito options. Hmm?  Definitely worth a visit when you are shopping and getting ready to drop. Open every day from 7 am to 2pm. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Affordable breakfast food with the most delicious bacon ever! Also, perfect fries, not soggy and not too crunchy! Will come back!"}
{"text":"Let's start with that I love this place.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is that there is a serious lack of staff. It's either not enough wait staff or not enough cooking staff. I'm not really sure. This place is always packed. It's always a minimum 20 minute wait to get seated and then when you're seated, it takes another 10 to get your drink and then another 10 for your order.   Personally they need to add wait staff. They are working far too many tables per waiter/waitress. If they added 2 to a shift, they could churn people in and out of here. Bus boys wouldn't hurt either.   Overall great food, great location and great setting but too understaffed for the amount of business they get."}
{"text":"SUCH good food! Incredible kinds of bacon. EIGHT KINDS OF BACON. Rachel was our server and she was fantastic!!! Super friendly, and she was super prompt with getting us drinks even though the restaurant was busy! We had the chorizo and eggs, and the oink french toast. Pictures posted below!"}
{"text":"Was hoping to be blown away by the maple bacon donut, but it was dry and lacking in maple flavor. Had a couple good bites but other bites not. The other more standard fare items were enjoyed. Pancakes, omelettes, etc were good. Little slow on the service with one large table of single checks slowing things up."}
{"text":"We live in the area and were pleased to see a new breakfast place opening. It seems to be a locally owned small business and we find the best food and service in this type of establishment. To borrow from William S. Burroughs writing about the Rio Grande Valley; \"\"In the Valley, restaurants are not operated by people who are cookers and purveyors of food. They are opened by somebody who decides that \"people always eat\" so a restaurant is a \"good deal\".\"\"  The owners may have restaurant experience, but it's not apparent. The staff is young, and doesn't  seem to know how sit-down breakfast works. They probably grew up eating from the McDonalds drive-up window. We got coffee and placed our order, and never saw the waitress again until she was ready to give us the bill. Our coffee was gone long before the food came, someone in a black uniform (one of the owners?)  brought the food to us, but didn't see our coffee cups were empty. The waitress never came over to ask us if everything was OK. She did ask if we wanted the check when she saw our plates were empty. At that point she asked if we wanted more coffee. A quick fix would be to take the owners and waitstaff across the street to I-HOP for breakfast so they could see what they should be doing."}
{"text":"Recently moved from Columbus, Oh to Phoenix. Drove the whole way. On our second or third day here we went to The Oink for breakfast. It was the first time since leaving Ohio that we had great service. In fact our server was so good she was probably one of the best ones I've ever had. I didn't catch her name unfortunately but she was a really tall brunette.     She was so friendly right from the get go and you could tell she knows what she's doing. It was almost like she was reading my mind with the coffee I wanted, even offered to give me a cup to go. My boyfriend and I were so stressed from the road and being in a new place that we weren't that high-spirited when we came in and she made my day.  And the food was delicious! I got the oink omelette and he got the Arizona omelette and pancakes and we loved our food. The fruit was really good too. My omelette was even good reheated. I only got through 1/4 of it so I had plenty of leftovers to eat later on. The sauce on the Arizona omelette was so good that I snagged some from my boyfriend's plate to use on mine. I will definitely be back there and hopefully get that same server because she was phenomenal"}
{"text":"I had a pleasant valley omelette with bacon cheddar cheese and spinach. The presentation was rustic and the omelette was flat and greasy. Server was testy to start but warmed up over time.  Lots of options for sides and toast. If in area would give a second try but would not search it out."}
{"text":"Loved this place so much.  I was there with my husband, 4 year old and three 8 yr old girls. We were there on a friday afternoon and had no wait. I ordered the special french toast ( guess what its crusted in). It was so good, everyone tried a piece and I still had leftovers. The portion sizes are huge! (a good thing). My husband got the Huevos rancheros and they were spicy and greasy just the way they should be. I can't wait to go back and try the bacon pancakes!! Oh and my favorite was the cute menu with tiny pink pigs showing what has bacon in it."}
{"text":"Took a visit to Oink Cafe on a work lunch.  Very unique atmosphere. Pig and bacon shrines everywhere. We ordered a flight of bacon to share. Some of them were pretty interesting. I particularly enjoyed the jalapeno bacon and apple cider bacon.  I got the ranchero chimichanga. A giant mess of pork and cheese. Not bad at all, but nothing to write home about. I would consider the breakfast options next time."}
{"text":"Breakfast was delish!  I had the Oink Chimi with a side of hash browns (see pic). It came hot and I actually had to wait a bit to eat (I love that - nothing worse than paying for Luke warm food). The portions were so big I could only eat half. The pork inside was very good (slow cooked in bacon grease - c'mon man!) and the chorizo sauce on top added a lot of flavor. My wife had the Oink French toast and also could only eat half. The raspberry and blueberry sauce was a perfect topping.   One minor thing:  We ordered half a 'flight' (lol) and picked the applewood, pepper and sugar bacon. The bacon was very good but...Both my wife and I could barely tell a difference between the flavors. Thought there would be a noticeable difference especially when you have sugar and pepper.   Service was friendly, fast and consistent. Ambience was casual and clean.   Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place.... Won't be back. We ordered biscuits and gravy and chorizo and eggs with a side of turkey and bacon. It took 50 min for the food to come out and when it did everything was cold. The sparse sausage gravy  was lumpy and bland, and the biscuits were dry.   On the chorizo and eggs, my dining companion said they were 'okay' mind you that the waitress had said that the reason for the wait on the food was because they were making \"fresh Chorizo'' we wondered if they meant they were mid slaughter being as it took so long to arrive. But then it was just OKAY? yeah, not good enough.   When the food came out the waitress dropped the side of turkey sausage, which ended up being a blessing because, though it took 10 more minutes to get a new order, at least it was hot.   We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Everyone was def right about trying the bacon flavor sampler with 8 different flavors. I loved jalapeño and maple, but they were all very good. In addition, we had great service . The manager came around and checked on everyone including us. She was delightful and made great conversation. Perfect mixture between amazing food and great service. Also- she told us one is opening in Tucson if you live there!"}
{"text":"Its ok.. love the bacon.. for sure -- other then just another normal breakfast place.. really packed ! great servers!"}
{"text":"I don't like how their tables are set up. Booths against the side of the walls, with individual tables in the aisle. Not the best set up if you're there by yourself because everybody's staring at you and makes for awkward dining experience.  Some of the wait staff are very rude, and yet some are very friendly. I saw they automatically gave every other table in the place free glasses of water. I didn't get any free glasses of water. I wish some of the rude wait staff would quit or get fired, because they give the place a bad rep. They do have a good manager who is helpful with customer requests.   Good mix of customers. Not too many old people, not too many kids, not too many business people there, just a good mix of customers. I didn't feel uncomfortable or out of place there. Will probably be back."}
{"text":"Service was fine but food is not impressive.  I ordered the california omelette. A dry egg omelette with small chunks of unflavored chicken paired with cheap tasting pepper jack cheese, jalapeños and topped with two small slices of avocado. The flavors do not mingle at all and I was not impressed in any way.  Props for having gluten free toast.  The hash browns are like cubes of French fries. Unimaginative except for the addition of some browned onions that are too sparse to add much flavor. *** I'm sorry I had the Homefries. The Homefries were like cubes of fries. ****  Service was fine.  Coffee was dark at least.  Wouldn't come back based on flavor alone."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place very much! Every time I go, it's always busy and there's usually a wait. Sometimes the wait isn't long and some times it is... but i definitely feel like the wait is worth it.  Everything revolves around bacon... I mean who doesn't love bacon right!? I tend to find myself always ordering their Oink French toast. And can I just say, how DELICIOUS AND OMG!!! Their French toast is!?!!! It's coated with this golden brown deliciousness... (I know what it's coated with but I'll have y'all figure that one out...) and it's covered with blueberries and topped with whipped cream. Definitely no syrup needed because it is perfectly sweet all on its own."}
{"text":"Had the biscuit and gravy with eggs! OMG... the best ever. Wife had the blueberry pancakes... love them!!"}
{"text":"It was a Monday at 10 am. We were seated outside. Another couple was seated after us right next to us.  After 15  minutes they had water/coffee and ordered. We didn't even have the server that sat us ever come back and a knowledge our presence.  We simply got up and left, I mean what's the point of complaining when people are making your food??"}
{"text":"We stumbled on this place by accident while on vacation in Phoenix. The sign that said \"breakfast, lunch, bacon\" caught our eye cause who doesn't love bacon? We walked in and I realized that it was 1:48 and their closing time was 2:00. I said \"oh I'm sorry I see it's about closing time,\" but the hostess said \"nonsense! Please take a seat.\" Everyone was so friendly at this place. We had great service and the food was wonderful. We started off with a maple bacon doughnut that my husband talked about for days afterward. The kids ordered breakfast food- the pancakes and french toast were great. I had a salad that was good as well. We left stuffed and very satisfied and would love to eat here again if we are ever in the area"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge breakfast person to start with, but they had really good food. I got fresh orange juice, which was satisfying. The hash browns and grilled cheese was a good. Staff was pleasant."}
{"text":"We like the name but this is the first time I persuaded my wife to check it out. We sat outside on a pleasant morning. We an an excellent server. We started with a bacon bloody mary: better than it sounds. I had the oink omelette though the dog is getting a big part of it. My wife had a blt which was mostly bacon.  We missed bacon covered pastry and the bacon flight which is 8 pieces of bacon, one of each kind sold.   The only problem was that my plate apparently waited for the omelette as toast and hash browns were barely warm. All the food tasted good."}
{"text":"This cafe serves good brunch fare, perhaps a tad pricey but the food is definitely tasty and satisfying. The service is very friendly and the atmosphere is casual ... I was about to say relaxed, but then I remembered how crowded it gets on weekends and the wait can be quite long during those times. Unless you plan to come early on weekends, weekdays are probably the best days to try this place out."}
{"text":"I work close by, so I've ordered to go breakfast a couple times now. Food is fantastic. I've already let all my foodie friends on my side of town know that this place is a must. I get the bacon Benedict with the jalapeño bacon and hash browns. Definitely my favorite so far. Their chai tea latte was good, today I had just plain coffee and that was good too. The time estimate they give me is always accurate as well. My only complaint is that the place is very busy and the girls seem stressed, perhaps a little extra help for them would be a good idea (:"}
{"text":"Was in the area for vacation, July 2015. It was okay, not a knockout, although the staff was extremely helpful and pleasant. Bacon was not what you would expect from a establishment specializing in America's favorite meat!   Taste like slices you could get at any diner or restaurant around the country."}
{"text":"A plethora of bacon choices and busy at 10:30 for breakfast is always good news.  A counter gives a modern place an old school feel not to mention a decent patio.  This is a perfect idea and needed breakfast option for the area."}
{"text":"WARNING: My family and I never got to try the food.  I have never written a negative review and I am sad that a new place has to be my first.  So my husband has been waiting for this place to open for a month.  He booked opening weekend on the calendar and invited the whole family.  The four of us (toddler and teen as well) arrived about 10am.  There was no one to greet us and looked like they had a number (maybe 6) of families waiting.  After a few minutes a (teen?) girl came over and kind of took our name.  No information, no wait time, no menus (which we took to look over ourselves).  Noticed tables sitting empty but not cleared.  Another couple waiting next to us for 10 minutes ended up finally having their server come over and hand them their bill.  Interesting...  We waited for over a hour.  In that time no one saw a bus boy.  The two tables were never cleared of their slowly rotting food in that entire time (though the \"greeter\" girl came over to the same table twice, clearing 1-2 cups each time...).  A few groups were slowly seated as we waited, but we also noticed the outside tables were empty but no one was being asked to sit outside.  About 30 mins in, the greeter girl came over to see if anyone wanted to sit outside (should have been done from the start.).  As she looked for people, she rolled her eyes when she couldn't find the name from her list.  When we were finally seated (by the same greeter...), the table soaking wet.  She grabbed some paper towels and handed them to my son, who dried the table himself.  No silverware was on the table so a few minutes later, one of the owners/managers put some down.  He half-heartedly (and inappropriately if I may add) said \"Guess you waited awhile?\".  I said it looked like their were some logistics issues and he immediately shot back that \"No, we are very busy\".  Um, if you cannot handle your shop being busy, than yes - you have logistics issues.  My husband asked if there were any busboys and he said there were three and they were all working.  Wrong attitude all around - this is not how to endear your customer base.  After he walked off, my son noticed the silverware had dried egg on several pieces and that the 5-6 tables nearest to us had NO food on them - all the families were waiting without menus.  That was the last straw.  As the waitress came over for the first time to ask for our drink requests, I explained it was not needed as we were leaving.  It sounds like the food here could be excellent.  But they need someone with major restaurant management experience to get these things ironed out immediately.  Additionally, management needs to realize that their attitudes can make or break their business.  I love supporting local shops and I wish them the best.  However, I will wait for more yelp feedback to determine if we will ever return.  P.S.  In going over my review with my husband and son, he said he has a few friends that went over the weekend with their families as well.  One said they waited over 1.5 hrs only to get the wrong items delivered to their table, with no explanation of what happened or apology.  Very disappointing..."}
{"text":"Great way to celebrate International Bacon Day! Started with their signature Bacon Bloody Mary which could be a meal all on its own. My table shared the flight of bacon. So good! I order the Stuffed Pork Loin Benedict special. AMAZING! A delicous and very creative way to present a benedict. Service at the Oink is always very friendly. If you haven't been yet you should..... Go get your Oink on!"}
{"text":"Amazing service great food.  Family friendly.  Bacon donut was the best!  We Were going to go to ihop but saw this and went on a whim.  So glad we made the choice we were not disappointed"}
{"text":"I went here with my wife and couple of our friends during the Sunday morning breakfast rush. This place was very busy, and I could see why. The reason? Bacon. Need I say more?  So I totally pigged out. I figures, what the heck. New place? Let's go knee deep.   I had The Oink Omelette. I used to be a fat kid, so I felt my old self pop out.   Five eggs, with bacon, sausage, ham and cheddar cheese. With hash browns. How I didn't keel over with a heart attack, I don't know. In my defense! I didn't eat the whole thing!   But I did eat a lot. The servers here were so friendly! There was an older woman in particular who I noticed calling people by their names. She was very attentive with refilling coffee and water.   Next time, I think I'll try their jalapeno bacon."}
{"text":"Bacon! Bacon!  And more Bacon!  Even the donuts are made out of bacon.  It is really quite good though not spectacularly so.  -2 stars if you are a vegetarian."}
{"text":"After passing this place numerous times, I finally had a chance to visit for brunch. It's a basic breakfast cafe. Nothing too fancy but not divey either. A perfect place to meet friends for a quiet lunch or breakfast. It's also very child friendly. I had the california chicken sandwich and it was very good! It was a nice sized chicken breast , with bacon, cheese, and green chile. I've never had green chile on a chicken sandwich and it was sooo good!  I couldn't eat it fast enough. I ordered my son the chicken fingers which were the right amount of chicken and breading. My companions both had french toast and were very happy. The service was prompt and friendly. Overall a fun experience that I will definitely try out again."}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in the door it's a great experience happy efficient staff and awesome food!  What more can you ask for!! A definite first choice!!"}
{"text":"Amazing French toast. It's seriously the best French toast I've ever had. I don't even care about anything else. The service was good. The French toast was great. My friend had the pork Benedict. She loved it."}
{"text":"Had to Give only 2 stars today...asked for eggs over medium not running and 1/2 cooked !!!! Hash Browns and Bacon were good and also warm , Sourdough Toast was just Okay seemed like Oil put on it though...Dissapointing Breakfast this morning for the Oink"}
{"text":"Entered the establishment, was told to sit anywhere I wanted,  did so in a booth. Sat there for 15 minutes like the invisible man.even waving arms could  ot catch the attention of any waitstaff.  No coffee  no water  no menu,  nothing. I'm happy at I hop now across the street. They took 15 minutes of my life. They won't get my money."}
{"text":"This is such a unique place!  The atmosphere is fun and casual, but it's a nice enough place to take the parents to.  It's sorta like Denny's meets Starbucks as far as being nice.  I had a maple bacon donut and it was amazing.  I have never been a fan of putting bacon on pancakes, but that's precisely what this tasted like without being being overpowering in any way.  Also great cappuccinos.  The wait staff are awesome, and once I forgot to tip them but they were so graceful about it."}
{"text":"There was a wait and that's to be expected. 40 minutes. The part that took just as long was to get our food. -1 star. We had 3 kids so after sitting out side waiting and coming in and waiting... Just not fun. -1 more star for very ordinary food all around the table. I do however regret not getting a bacon flight! I just might have to come back and give it another shot. But if your in the mood for an ordinary breakfast joint I say you will be pleased! I did love the Pigs colored by kids posted on the wall! Gave us something to look at! (Also has a decent patio. I love patios ;) )"}
{"text":"Tried Oink Cafe on a whim today with some friends, and may I say -- OMG!!! I absolutely LOVED this place! The wait staff was absolutely on point and extremely friendly. The owner happened to be in also, and came over and chatted with us for a bit also which made us feel extra special. As far as the food goes, the Paradise Valley omelet was phenomenal and I could taste the freshness -- I also substituted the applewood smoked bacon for the jalapeno bacon (they have 8 different flavors of bacon). We also tried the bacon maple donut -- this is an absolute MUST TRY!!!! Oink Cafe exceeded our expectations and I will definitely be returning again."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come to this place for almost a year.  I was so happy when Monica O. set up the Breakfast Club at this location.  We had a huge table,  our server was great, having to take care of such a large table can be overwhelming, and she was trying really hard to be on top of everything.  I had the French Toast Combo, which gave the the option to have two slices of my choice of bacon, I had the jalapeño and the honey cured.  Both, really great.  I have not had bacon in months.  My husband chose his meal from the lunch menu, so he was in heaven, he is not so fond of breakfast food, so he was thrilled when our server told him it was ok to order from the lunch menu.  He had the pull pork sandwich with sweet potato fries, he ordered the fries just for me, so I could try them.  I love sweet potato fries.  I had four or five, so yummy.  Can't wait to come back, and next time I will bring the twins."}
{"text":"I like this place!   When I was growing up, my Mother and Grandmother, were determined to put weight on me with their hamburgers.  There'd usually be a 1/2 pound of meat covered with the freshest condiments you might ask for.  Having come from a dairy ranch where they got the freshest beef you could ask for,  any beef they bought had to be up to their standards.  I ate well when we had hamburgers.  My mushroom with swiss burger was the first I have had in a long  time that brought back those child hood memories.  The Burger itself is really to big for two hands to hold and I have large hands.  So the bottom bun got soggy.  The beef was fresh enough for it to get that way as you bite into the beef and tastes good in the process!  My friend had a burger with bacon on it.  They have eight kinds of bacon to choose from.  She had sugar cured and it was thick cut and yummy.  I am going to go out on a limb and say I think the Oink has the best burgers in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"My grandma and I come to oink all the time and Iw love it! The have the best Benedict in town!"}
{"text":"Been here three weeks in a row and every time the food is consistently good! All three times it has been really busy but that never changed how good everything is! Service is great, food comes out fast, and coffee is good! If you don't like crowds and super loud environment then bring a jacket (when it's cold) and sit on the patio! Well worth the chill.   Ps skip the bacon flight and just eat the Jalapeño bacon mmmm  Pss and the poinsettia which is champs and cranberry juice"}
{"text":"Took a group of 8 here this morning for brunch. Our server was great. I had my usual strawberry chicken salad and it was delicious! Others had breakfast items. We all left full and happy. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We have been a few times over the past year or so. In the past we have stopped in for breakfast and the omelettes have been quite good. The other day we stopped in for lunch which I can only say was that is was just  \"ok\". My son ordered a waffle off the kids menu and they made him the adult size. I knew he couldn't eat it all but he was thrilled when it arrived. I ordered the turkey sandwich and found myself looking to make sure the turkey actually made it on to the sandwich. Had they just put on a little more I would have enjoyed it but there were sections of the sandwich that were meatless and there wasn't enough to spread out to cover the entire piece of bread. The fries were decent and the server was friendly and quick to refill our drinks when needed.  Maybe it was just an off day. Since our previous experiences have been good we will certainly give it another try."}
{"text":"I was probably the only person to go there and not order any bacon. What was I thinking???   I was thinking of their delicious freshly made biscuits and sausage gravy. That's what I was thinking. If I had four stomachs I could have finished my breakfast and gotten a few slices of bacon. Go hungry. Really hungry as portions are huge and you are going to be ant to the at it all.   Mom had the French toast with strawberries blueberries and whipped cream. The French have nothing on this breakfast.  Lol. Amazing. I can't decide which one I like more so I'm going back for another test. Maybe a few more breakfast just to make sure which one is my fave. I do know this is my new fave breakfast place in north Phoenix."}
{"text":"Overall review?: go try EGGstasy.  So everything is homeade & pancakes were fluffy, the flight of bacon has 8 strips that don't have a lot of difference, you can taste the jalapeño and peppered bacon flavors but the sugar and honey cured weren't too different. The pecanwood and applewood were truly the only real flavored bacons that were different.    We ordered the florentine Benedict with honey cured bacon and strawberry pancakes, they were fluffy but not extraordinary. There was a bit of shortage on the sauce too.  Then they forgot the bacon on the Benedict so it tasted very plain until they brought the bacon which still just made it just... ok.  In summary, you could probably make a similar breakfast at home. If you want a special Benedict, do any of them from EGGstasy if you plan to wait 30-40 minutes on any day & the same goes to pancakes.  You could go to butter fields for better pancakes too.  There's just not any \"you must stop here\" for bacon or breakfast per the wow factor that is out there.  Not sure what they made for the guy from cnn...  The server was great but seating took quite awhile... I think that's more due to people camping out. They were busy in the beginning but there was plenty of people to ask how things were afterwards- and while we told them they said \"next time we'll bring you more sauce\".  I guess that's ok... Still nothing I'll be back for sadly."}
{"text":"First time here. Got here early thankfully 830 am. It was already busy but a line formed soon after. I tried the pork confit benedict. Everything was just fine. I didn't try any bacon though and will next time. Enjoyed a traditional house bloody mary perfectly spiced, didn't have to add anything. Got some bacon donut holes to go. Tried one when I got home, was drier than I thought it would be, not sure if it was supposed to be that way though. Would have been great on ice cream. Service was friendly, lots of families too so good for everyone."}
{"text":"Pretty basic breakfast food, fast service.  Food was a bit greasy for my personal liking."}
{"text":"Great food. Had the phoenix omelette. It was great. Prices were not bad. Service was great."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to The Oink Cafe for an impromptu birthday breakfast. To their credit, we were pleasantly surprised. We were sat in a timely fashion and the server steered us towards ordering macchiatos instead of just coffees. The bacon platter was awesome. My favorite were the jalapeno bacon strips. The country fried steak came highly recommended, and it did not disappoint. Their staff was friendly, the restaurant was clean, and the food and service was terrific! This place is worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Can't speak to the food, because we decided to leave after waiting 20 minutes without being greeted or getting a drinks order, while watching multiple tables around us get served first, despite arriving after us. There only seemed to be one server for a section of 12 tables. The ambiance wasn't great - it was extremely loud and chaotic. Not a good spot for a relaxing breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"I was very unhappy with this place. I ordered the biscuits and gravy after reading all the reviews, and was highly disappointed. I would think for a place that specializes in pork the sausage in the gravy would of been much better. But it tasted low quality. And the biscuits themselves where very dry. Wouldn't recommend to anyone who actually knows what good food taste like."}
{"text":"We came here for a cup of coffee and decided to order some eggs and bacon. Clearly bacon is their strong suit and the coffee was really very good as well.  I decided to come back the next day and see if yesterday was a fluke. Since we generally liked our original visit over a year ago but at the time we found things somewhat uneven.  Well the good news to report is that since my first visit with fellow Yelp'ers and Pepper Head Mark, things have improved. Service can be a bit slow during busy periods, they have definitely improved. The sad sausage I had eighteen months ago has been retired. It's been replaced by a very flavorful one (see photos).  Today we ordered the French Toast and the Oink's French Toast. The latter is just over the top sweet and a bit too much for this gourmand. While the regular French Toast would be enjoyed by every Gourmet as being just right. Look that up in your Roget's. LOL  Expect to pay $15 each if you don't order a 4 piece (1/2 flight) or 8 piece (full flight) of their absolutely delicious thick flavored bacon. If you do, and I would recommend that you do, then expect to pay accordingly, around $22-$25.  But ohhh, but it's sooo worth it!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"They chose the appropriate name for this cafe!!   Oink is accurately descriptive for how I felt trying to consume half my meal!!  The waitress even asked me if there were enough hash browns if you can believe that!!  Perfectly poached eggs and the bacon variety was surprising.  Jalapeño is my favorite kind of bacon now and will try to find my own to make my own BLT with avocado for lunch!!   Love the availability of getting local brews for breakfast.   Incredibly kind wait staff.   A great place to have breakfast.  I will definitely return for lunch soon.   Great cafe!!!"}
{"text":"The idea is great and what inevitably will get you to try Oink Cafe.  The hostess staff and most employees seem to have better things to do than be at work.  I ordered the BLT.  It is listed as one of their specialties. The waitstaff asked what type of bacon I wanted as they offer eight flavors.  I stated Applewood, but changed my mind and said, bring whatever you recommend.  The BLT came out in three layers of blah wheat bread.  I'm pretty sure it was a 99 cent loaf of bread and the bacon had no flavor at all.  The manager came around and asked how our lunch was, I told him it was okay.  He said just ok and I told him my thoughts; the meal was rather bland.  He said, hopefully, they can impress better my next visit.  They won't have that opportunity.  Where we can order bacon everything from specialty store, don't eat here if you want some Jimmy Dean packaged bacon."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots in Phoenix!  Bacon and sausage are just below filet mignon on my list of favorites.  Oink has several different sausage varieties, a few different types of bacon and everything else is delicious too!  I have had the pigs in a blanket, omelets, French toast... they were all excellent.  This is one of the spots we take guests when they visit.  You wont leave hungry and it's got some character which really sets it apart from your average corporate chain restaurant!"}
{"text":"They have breakfast and lunch pretty well figured out. They don't have *everything*, but what they do, they do well.  We've had the bad luck of having one certain server several times that isn't as good as the others. Doesn't ask what kind of bacon you want of the eight choices, nor which  sides for sandwiches. She couldn't figure out how to accommodate a flavored green tea."}
{"text":"Bloody mary flights and they also do mimosa flights.  Not to mention a good value breakfast.  Indoor and limited outdoor seating.  Cyclist friendly for after ride protein.  Thai chili was my favorite but all had a unique flavor and very tasty."}
{"text":"A flight of bacon, pigs can fly. Yummy, it was 8 different types of bacon.  My 11 year old son claimed it was the best Hot Chocolate Ever, he is hard to please. The staff was friendly and professional, moderate pricing for a great breakfast. I just moved into the area, I shall return often. Closes at 2:30pm, no late lunches."}
{"text":"The caramel bacon glazed donut was awesome!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was awesome. Service was a little slow, but the place was packed. We didn't have to wait long for a table on a late Sunday morning.   Overall I was really impressed by the restaurant. Decor was funky and the menu was unique."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food, nice servers! I wish they were open later :)"}
{"text":"This little cafe tucked in the PV mall area is cute and convenient. I love that I can come here with my dog (open patio), order a heathy breakfast without sounding like a you-know (they have an egg white/no cheese omelet option), OR just go all out on an indulgence if the mood strikes. The staff is friendly, the place is always clean, and the decor is cute (they fully embrace their inner piggly spirit animal). I've always had consistent service and quality here; I recommend."}
{"text":"The Oink Cafe is still young so I am hoping for improvements, not so much with the food, but really with the service.   I met a client there one morning for breakfast and although the service was okay, the food was wonderful. I decided to go back the next day for breakfast again and try the French Toast this time. I went to the hostess stand and waited to be seated. I stood there and stood there. I even had a waitress that was standing by the bar doing nothing look right at me and look away. Finally, another waitress running food told her to seat me and she came over and did. I had the French Toast. It was terrific! I wish they had let the bread soak a little longer, but for the most part it was delicious!   I took my husband there the next Saturday and just more service problems. The waitress again was rough. My husband's omelet  was wonderful but the home fries were cold. You could tell they sat getting cold until the omelet was done. My French Toast was good, but really dry. Again they didn't let it soak long enough.   The concept is great and the food is terrific, but there is still some operational issue that need to be worked out. Better training of the waitresses or better waitresses. The kitchen seemed to struggle during the busy weekend compared as to when I was there during the weekday. I will go back as the food is really good and I hope that they mature!"}
{"text":"Yum...such a great breakfast place in Paradise Valley!  We stopped in with another couple and both of our dogs.  The staff was so welcoming and accommodating.  They seated us at the perfect, shaded table, brought water for our dogs and quickly took our order.  I thoroughly enjoyed my healthy choice omelet with a side of honey cured bacon - wow, was that good!  I can't wait to come back and try the flight of 8 different types of bacon...if the other 7 are as good as the 1 I tried, we are in for a treat."}
{"text":"I wish I could give no stars. This was the worst service I have ever had in my life. Took 30 minutes just to take our order, messed up the order twice. The waitress then took my plate while I was still eating. I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Bacon flight is a must. The bacon maple donut was surprisingly good. It was served warm and we cut it in 5 as a appy for breakfast. Servers were overwhelmed with a huge Sunday crowd but still kept things moving. The shape of the space and decor is off-putting, others in my party loved it. The omelet was great, hash browns were a bit salty, greasy and room temperature The coffee was S+*^bucks type of \"over strong\", the current trend but not my fav. I'll take a smooth cup o joe any day. The bacon alone is worth the trip."}
{"text":"If I could eat here every day, I would... food is amazing, drinks are amazing, and the staff is amazing... really friendly customer service . I can't wait till I go back. Bloody Mary's is something I would recommend here. Flight of bacon as well.."}
{"text":"Great place to get a mimosa or bacon bloody merry :-) I'm a regular at this place because of good food and great breakfast.....the staff is always friendly....but...unfortunately the customers are always rude. I've witnessed table hawks and pushiness on numerous occasion.....I've sat at the bar and had people hover over my food and try to force feed me just to get my stool.....I guess that's because this is a popular neighborhood place."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and the food has always been delicious! Ive eaten their bacon, pancakes, waffles, and french toast. Only giving 4 stars because the hostess had a bit of an attitude, but the food made up for it!"}
{"text":"The food is worth the wait. We had a great breakfast this morning. Close to ACU. Go Firestorm. Our server did a great job. I think her name was Taylor. I did overhear a guy complain about they were quoted 30 minute wait and it took 45 minutes. What did he expect. There was a line out the door. Can't wait to go visit my daughter so I can take her back."}
{"text":"The food was awesome and our server Josie was great. We went on Mothers Day and it was packed but we still got great service. The eggs Benedict was amazing. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Food is usually pretty good. The jalepeno bacon is amazing if cooked right. The service is usually pretty slow though. The manager is always visible and very nice."}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is excellent and the staff is pretty good too. The chai latte is amazing. I always end up getting two. The only downside is the tables aren't always cleaned; I have asked to switch tables a few times due to this."}
{"text":"Best Mac cheese anywhere!!!  The service was fast and friendly, and the prices are SO reasonable!!"}
{"text":"Walking into Oink, you'll discover it's anything but a pigpen. Clean, minimalist design, wide open aisles, bright atmosphere. The menu is simple, but lots of bacon choices. Prices are moderate, food quality is excellent. Most breakfasts include choice of hash browns, cottage cheese or even fruit at no additional charge. Coffee is simply standard old brewed restaurant coffee, but they do have specialty espresso based drinks, that I did not try. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I guess this place is known for their bacon? Other than their many bacon-infused menu items I wouldn't really get that vibe, I ordered a side of applewood smoked bacon and it was pretty regular. Nothing amazing or special about it.   French toast was yummy, but again, pretty standard.   Cute pictures of piglets. Nice color-scheme. Coffee bar is plus. Screaming children was a negative...  The service was great. Good location.   Will probably back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Wowza!! We started by sharing the warm maple bacon donut holes which were so delicious. I had the pork confit eggs benedict, and son had bacon pancakes. And we couldn't pass on the flight of bacon. Ok...so we were stuffed, but it was well worth it!!"}
{"text":"First off, the food was excellent. However, the service almost made me leave before I even ordered. Granted, I went in on a Sunday morning and it was busy. When I approached the hostess stand I asked how I could order takeout. Before the hostess answered we were interrupted by a man who was possibly the owner or manager. He sent her to take care of something and walked away also leaving me standing there by myself. So I next approached the register where a cashier appeared to be either cashing out an order or entering an order. The only greeting I received after standing there was when the server held up her finger as a gesture to tell me to wait but she said nothing. After I patiently waited for about two minutes I moved over to the counter and waited until the owner/mgr took my order. After giving my order I left for a few minutes to shop while my order cooked. When I returned it was difficult to find someone to help me pick up my order. There was a very nice, but busy lady helping at the counter. I overheard her say she was a school teacher helping the family out and she was kind and helpful. I had the biscuits and gravy which were great, my daughters ate up all of their bacon pancakes, and my husband enjoyed an omelette.   My family has lived in Phoenix for about 4 years and we have seen 3 restaurants open and close in that location since then. We are really hoping that the Oink Cafe is able to make something out of the location. I will probably return when things get settled because the food was good but if the service and apathy toward customers is a similar experience I won't likely give it a 2nd try."}
{"text":"Walked in and had to wait 5-6 minutes for acknowledgment from anyone.   After we asked if we could just take a table,  we waited what seemed another 5mins for menus.   We asked for coffee ASAP and sat another 8mins before just leaving.   The place was not busy and had tables open.   I don't think speed is a priority and from what we were able to gleam from the prices on the filthy menu, neither is value.   $3 for an egg and $2.50 for a slice of bacon? ... really?   No thanks.   We went to 5 & diner for half the cost and had coffees in hand within 4mins."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times already and have had two great breakfasts.  The wait staff is pleasant and upbeat.  We were seated right away and able to order in a matter of minutes.The food arrives fresh from the kitchen and reasonable portions.    The restaurant has been fully updated from its previous incarnations.  The price of the food is reasonable and the coffee is delicious.  Visit!"}
{"text":"So unimpressed by this place and the menu. Considering the name I was expecting a great breakfast pork selection. Not so much. Pork chop I got was tough. My brother had pork sausage links I swear are the same frozen ones the lame breakfast chains use.   I won't be back. I would  give 2.5 stars if I could because our service was excellent on a very busy Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Eh. Food is bad quality cooked with to much butter or the eggs are just cheap not much taste service is decent staff are friendly and nice but sometimes over talkative when I'm trying to eat my food I've been there more than once I liked it the first time then slowly realized the quality of the food really sucks!"}
{"text":"I seriously love this place.  The only thing that stinks is the french dip is off the menu.  But today I ordered a bbq sandwich.  BBQ sandwiches are tricky, you seriously have to get every bit right, juicy but not so much that my bread is like mush, pork with a strong enough flavor I can taste it through the sauce, and bread I can chew!  Well, they nailed it.  They also put the cole slaw on the side for me since I'm weirded out by cole slaw on a sandwich.  Oh, and I have mentioned the sweet potato fries....oh ya! They don't salt them so you will have to do so but that's ok because I can go either way with these tasty morsels :)  Did I say that I got all this while walking in 10 minutes before they closed and they were so sweet to me and didn't complain, at least while I was in earshot....thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and each time my experience has been average.  I primarily continue to come here because it's only a few blocks from my house and it's an easy place to meet clients for meetings. However, having said all of that, I highly doubt I'll be back after my experience this morning.  I arrived this morning to read the paper and relax.  I always order the huevos rancheros because it's always been good to me.  I've had clients who have ordered other items on the menu and have been very disappointed (I have had two friends order a dish that came with a biscuit--each time, the biscuits had the consistency of a rock).  Anyway, for whatever reason, I decided to live dangerously and order something else.  I ordered the egg white omelet with home fries and whole wheat toast.  It arrived and was nothing unique or off-the-charts.  But hey, it tasted good.  After I was done polishing that off, I still had a hankering (yeah, that's right--a hankering) for something else.  Considering how full I was, I needed something small.  I remembered seeing blueberry pancakes on the menu, so I asked my server how many came with a side order.  He told me a stack of two or four. I asked him if they were gigantic and he said no, they were typical pancakes.  I put in an order for two.  When they arrived they looked good, but like everything else here, were nothing special.  Imagine my surprise when I cut into the short stack and realized only one of them had blueberries in it.  Oh well, what the hell; I ate them both.  After many attempts to get a coffee refill (I was seated on the patio--if you like refills, don't sit there) I gave up and looked at the check.  (Side note: The servers here immediately give you the check after your food arrives.  Their reasoning is that they don't want you to have to wait for the check.  I don't buy it.  I feel rushed when they do this. In fact, they tell you \"No rush\" when they put it on the table, so clearly I'm not the only one that has wondered about this.)  The check was pretty straightforward, except for the charge related to my two blueberry pancakes (sans blueberries).  For some reason, my server accidentally charged me for the blueberry pancake meal, or so I thought, since he charged me $6.99 for the dish.  I asked about it, and guess what?  It was not a mistake.  This place has the audacity to charge $7 for TWO PANCAKES!!!  What the heck is in them that they cost $3.50 a piece?  Before I wrote this review, I called IHOP  (yes, IHOP--they're across the street from Oink, so they're competition and the food quality is comparable) and asked them how much their double blueberry pancake side costs.  A stack of two costs $3.79 and a stack of four costs $6.99.  Can you explain that to me?  Same size, same ingredients, same zip code, hell, the same street, but Oink charges DOUBLE!  Anyway, considering the outrageous prices, the average service (servers are nice, but not very quick with the refills, or anything else, except the check), and the average/slightly above average food, I feel like I can do better.  IHOP, here I come!"}
{"text":"\"Bippity Boppity Bacon\". I wonder how Jim Gaffigan would feel about this cute 'lil joint?  When you walk in through the main entrance, you will notice the lovely patio and a walk up window (love it) where you can place a take-out order. Creative, but if you are going to wait for your order, I would recommend snagging one of the four seats at the inside counter where you can enjoy a coffee or espresso drink and salivate at the delicious-looking pastrie, some of which, are bacon flavored.  The walls are painted bright yellow, green, and orange, with fun wall art of various pigs. In addition to the four counter seats, there is plenty of seating between the green booths and tables, but if you have a party of five or larger, your only option is to push together the tables and sit in the uncomfortable looking wood chairs. Luckily, I was just there with my madre so we got to enjoy a comfy booth.  We were greeted and seated immediately by friendly staff and a few seconds later our waitress greeted us and took our drink orders. I ordered a latte that wasn't anything special (no latte art either), but hey, they don't advertise about their espresso, so no biggie. I opted for their half of sandwhich and soup or salad deal. I chose their BLT with applewood smoke bacon and a side salad, just so I don't clog up all my arteries. My mom went for the full BLT sandwhich with sweet potato fries. There area few bacon options to choose from like: applewood smoke, honey cured, sugar cured, peppered, and jalapeno bacon, but our server suggested to stay with the classic applewood smoked, so we listened. The sandwich was pretty tasty and they don't skimp on the yummy bacon, the side salad was boring and basic, but the sweet potato fries were delicious, good choice mom!  All in all, good service, decent food, reasonable prices. I would come back and try their bacon pancakes, which is what the server said they are known for, but I'm not in any rush. FYI: This place closes at 2pm everyday and isn't open at all on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Great food is about all I got.  Service is some of worst I've ever seen.  10 customers on a weekday morning and 8 people I saw working.....almost a one to one ratio.  Waited for everything...drink order, food, drink refill, and check.  Simple things could be better....fresh butter.....fresh OJ.   Hope it gets better....will try again later."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had breakfast here. Saw a lot of great reviews and it's usually busy.  I was very disappointed.  I started with the flight of bacon.. You get to try all their flavors of bacon. To my surprise, they all tasted the same.  Half of the strips of bacon were rock hard too.  I am a bacon fanatic like most true Americans, but man I was bummed!   I also had the biscuits and gravy.  That was pretty bland.  The gravy was cold, but at least the biscuit was fluffy.    I don't think I will be returning here, nor would i recommend it."}
{"text":"Jalapeño Bacon hell yea!!  Overall pretty good and will try again. Consistency on the poached eggs is a little off. Bacon also inconsistent some chewy others crisp and burnt. We did like the coffee, so glad more breakfast places have have raised the coffee standard.   Give this place a try."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My boyfriend and I have been going there for the last 6 months and absolutely love it  we have never had a bad experience there. The food is amazing and I can't even talk about the bacon without my mouth watering! Anne the manager is so nice and always takes care of the customers! We had stepped away from the restaurant to go to the book store while we waited to get sat and when we came back they had already called our name. So when I asked them, they said they would seat us at the next avaliable table. I didn't expect them to do this for us but no more than that minutes later we were being sat! My boyfriend ordered the Oink omelet and I had the egg breakfast. It was so good! Can't rave more about this place and the staff! Such a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Yum! I have been here a few times now and I have not been disappointed. The specialty coffees are great. I had a latte and it came out piping hot. I've had an omelet and the eggs Benedict and both were very good. Last time I was here I saw someone with an awesome looking Bloody Mary that had strips of bacon garnish which I will definitely try next time."}
{"text":"Good food.  Great service. The chicken strawberry salad is my favorite."}
{"text":"Was excited to eat here. Food was disgusting, too greasy, and service sucked. Would not recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Their French Toast is Awesome , their bloody marry is Awesome, the California omelette is Great the homefries are actually a bit crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside which is in my opinion perfect. BUT ..... their ham steak is more like a ham strip and the staff could be more informed of the menu and what the ingredients are in each plate and maybe pay more attention when taking the order in the first place. Most of the girls are attentive to other table besides their own which was good in our case or we would've sat with half our meal eaten and empty glasses.  All in all I would love to come back if we happen to be in the are again, but without pork chops on the menu and the ham steak being so thin we may decide on another place for lunch. Thanks to the floor manager for being so attentive when her server wasn't.  I am giving 5 stars because one server and a long wait time shouldn't shame a business that has such an AWESOME COOK , and Staff that does care."}
{"text":"Definitly not I would come back! Love bacon and seevice was good! Nice server too! But my biscuit and gravy looked like vomit!"}
{"text":"My normal breakfast joint was closed today, so I gave this restaurant a shot since it's close to home. I came in about three years ago but I can't really recall why I haven't been back.  For me, I could frame the experience around the home fries. I was looking forward to nice griddle finished home fries. You know the ones - soft potato with a crispy brown/black edge from the griddle top, with flavorful seasoning? Yeah, that's not what they do here. Instead you take cubed potatoes and throw them in the deep fryer, creating little square marbles that lack the texture and flavor of true home fries. Essentially, they are phoning in the effort on this part of the menu.  Service was friendly but ended on a sour note. I was her only customer yet it took five minutes to run my credit cards. Let's call it a minute to run the dirty dishes back to the dishroom, and then four minutes of chatting with a customer at the counter about cell phone plans.   With all of the great breakfast places nearby, including Joybus Diner and Perk, there's simply no reason to go back."}
{"text":"The food here is good, but the service has been great every time I've eaten here.  I'm not as big on their bacon, but they make great eggs and French toast :)  When looking for a nice place to meet a friend for breakfast or lunch, I've always enjoyed this café (and even though the patio outside is small, it's always good to be able to eat outside and enjoy the weather on a nice day)."}
{"text":"If you love all things bacon this is your place! Just across from paradise valley mall in the a Target parking lot Oink has quickly become a favor for Sunday morning breakfast. It fills fast so get there early but even a wait is worth it. All the servers are good and your food comes out quickly. I've had the breakfast hash which is excellent. Omelettes are delicious and coffee good as well. Enjoy! Long live Bacon!!"}
{"text":"I visited Oink for the first time today and I have to say the food was delicious and the service was great! I had an iced caramel latte, and the French toast combo with jalapeño bacon. The bacon was perfectly cooked and a little spicy! Some of the best bacon I've had. Great atmosphere, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Based on the name and outside advertisements, you'd assume that this was some sort of pork style specialty house. Once inside you'd assume that it would smell like pork. You'd assume there would be pictures of swine everywhere. And you'd assume that not only will the menu be pork heavy, but that also the server would promote and encourage pork. So imagine my surprise when none of these things were true.  It wasn't a big deal though that it seems they were trying real hard to be a classy restaurant. But its an oink cafe. That means pig coffee to me. I want Bacon and an espresso. It should smell like Bacon and coffee. Or Bacon or coffee. It was more of a chemical smell.   The layout was odd too. There were apparently two entrances. What I thought was the front which is located street side might have been the back because when you walk in, its a weird long hallway type room filled with tables. (BTW it was packed) The other side had what looked like a main counter with a menu but we never got that far because this was a be seated by server place.  Decorations were odd too. There were SOME artsy pictures of swine. But mostly random pictures of art. I love art but it didn't fit.   Our server must have been a rookie. Not very attentive. She kind of just threw the crayons in front of my daughter. She didn't explain the menu at all. It took her forever to bring our drinks. And I even tried to break the ice by asking the standard \"what would you get?\" question. Her response, \"I'm not really sure. I think everything's good.\"  Ok when I hear that I get annoyed. Humuor me at least. Also know you product and services. And if your going to promote a \"classy\" resturant, then don't wear short shorts. Nothing made sense. On to the menu:  Basically the menu is basic items like sanwhiches and salads that have one or two Bacon strips. Ok. Well I got the salad. And to my surprise it was pretty good.  It was a fresh spinach salad with an assortment of seeds and fruit and Bacon bits. Also they had a custom dressing called Bacon dressing. Now it tasted nothing like Bacon. It was more of a sweet vinagerette of sort. It was good. The salad though was amazing. it wasn't over filled with everything. It was mostly spinach. And again very fresh.   Salad was good enough to give a three star. Also it wasn't a bad experience, just dissapointing. And the only reason I factor in the poor server is because the owner himself was walking around greeting people and when he got to us, he wasn't really engaged or genuine. So perhaps a lack of customer service training could be the reason for our poor service.   If your in the area and you want a salad for lunch, I'd recommend them."}
{"text":"The oink café is great little breakfast joint if you've never been I would recommend giving it a try. So far I've had no issues with this spot. Food is good and servers all seem to be nice and friendly. The only minor complaints I might have is there seem to be a lot of fly's on the patio. More so than a normal patio where you would see the occasional fly. They really seem to be in abundance here. Also sometimes the food doesn't come out as hot as it should. Other than that I will still keep coming back,."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to try The Oink Cafe for a while, as we like to support our local businesses.  We got a coupon on the mail and went there for breakfast a couple of weeks ago. Our server Heather was nice, she was very patient as we had a mix up with the coupon and she helped us.  We liked the idea of flavored bacon, we tried the jalapeño and it was very tasty, however, they didn't pass the crispy bacon test... we always make sure to say 'very crispy'...  I ordered 'huevos rancheros' and didn't like them much... they had some sort of red enchilada sauce, which it would have been OK, but it was kind of sweet and I didn't like it.  Hubby ordered an omelette with chorizo an it was ok, it had the red sauce too.  Beans and potatoes were very good, I ended up making my own breakfast burrito at home with them : )  Oh, if you access through the Cactus entrance, make sure to go to the other door as the hostess is there... they do have a sign by the door but  I missed it..."}
{"text":"The service was great and the ambience was good.  We didnt feel rushed and enjoyed our long breakfast/lunch.  The people were so nice not to rush us out, it wasn't until I noticed the open sign facing our way did we think to ask them what time they close.  Apparenlty, it was an hour past the point I noticed.  They let us hang out, even gave us a free brownie and chocolate chip cookie which was to live for!.  The owners are very nice.  I ordered half a club sandwich and tortilla soup with sweet potato fries.  The sandwich much bigger than my bite could handle but delish! My boyfriend had a huge breakfast burrito.  The portions are massive!!!! The only thing is that we were expecting more pork options..at least pork chop or pulled pork items on the menu. But, it is definitely a place we will go back to."}
{"text":"Best eggs benedict ever! Service is always great home fries are delicious bacon Bloody Marys are great as well. I have brought my family from out of town to the Oink and everyone loves it every time!  The manager Sean is always coming around to make sure all guests  are having a great experience!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast over the weekend.  It was ok. We started with the flight of bacon.  I only really liked 2 of the flavors.  My husband enjoyed the spicier ones but I can't eat those.  The applewood was great though!  My breakfast was average - nothing special.  Service was average.  Overall, an ok experience.  I might come here again but wouldn't go out of my way for it.  I will say they had some pastries in a case by the front door... I didn't have the appetite left to try them but man did they look delicious!  Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"American Breakfast Food With Good Service  We popped in here for a little brunch after visiting REI nearby... This place was super packed and I must say it was good food.   I had the chicken fried chicken with gravy and it was good...   The manager lady was super friendly and made sure she stopped by to make sure we were happy mid meal...   Not much else to say but if you need a good feeding this may just be your spot...."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat breakfast. They get very busy so be prepared for a bit of a wait. But half the time they over estimate your wait time. Great variety on the menu and always great service. However depending on who is working the patio it tends to get forgotten and sometimes there has been confusion on who is actually waiting on us. Management is on top of it and has always noticed before we waited too long but I have had to point out to them one time when they seated two ladies on the patio on a rather hot day and 10 minutes went by before they were even offered water. But they made up for it with very quick playing. The flight of bacon is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Oink oink!!  That's what I was thinking as I saw the pigs on the walls, on the coffee mugs, and elsewhere around the Oink Cafe.  Not to mention the five different ways that bacon is prepared (applewood smoked, honey cured, sugar cured, peppered, jalapeno).  I found my experience very pleasant as I parked, sat down with no waiting late on a Saturday morning, and was greeting almost right away.  Don't get me wrong...there were still a lot of people in the restaurant, and it appeared that everyone was enjoying themselves.  The service was outstanding as my waitress was very pleasant and helpful and continued to stop by to check on my father and me.    The food itself was very good.  Both my father and I ordered traditional breakfasts (to keep it simple for our first time at the Oink Cafe).  He ordered applewood smoked bacon, extra crispy while I ordered honey cured bacon.  Both orders were delicious!  The rest of the breakfast resembled any other breakfast restaurant though the dishes were still good.  As an entire package (the food, service, wait, atmosphere), it was definitely worth the trip.  Plus, there are some coupons online for 15% off your bill, $1 off any gourmet drink, or a free maple bacon donut (at http://www.8coupons.com/discounts/the-oink-cafe-phoenix-85032).   Oh, and if you're not a fan of bacon, there are plenty of non-bacon breakfast and lunch dishes, too!"}
{"text":"We live in Colorado but visit Oink every trip to Phoenix!!!! Their bacon (all flavors) is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Okay so I work across the street and have thought about this place every single time.  Finally, my husband being home on a weekend and no kids, we went.  I had the 1/2 flight of bacon.  It was good, not great.  My bacon was not cooked evenly (some pieces were barely done, and one piece was burnt).  It was good and I could distinguish the flavors.  The Strawberry Cheesecake pancakes were awesome though.  Service was great, friendly and courteous.  I would come back, but give specific directions on how to cook my bacon."}
{"text":"Sometimes, I feel cheated by salads at restaurants, because I figure, I could buy a bag of lettuce, dump it on a plate and call it a day for a third of the price! I had a really satisfying strawberry and chicken salad  ($8.99)  here recently and will definitely go back next time I'm in the market for a healthy lunch out: 4 ounces of grilled chicken on a generous heap of salad, topped with blue cheese and fresh strawberries."}
{"text":"Pretty standard breakfast fare, I'd say. So the prices might be too high for the type of food you'd expect.   I got the pulled pork benedict which was good. It was very tender but the sauce was pretty limiting.   Bf had omelette. It was the five egg omelette which was huge but it looked pretty sparse to me in toppings. We also has a bacon donut which is really crunchy but wasn't warmed or anything so that kind of fell flat. Way too sweet. Skip the syrup with it but it might be too dry otherwise."}
{"text":"The wife and I decided to visit this locale this morning because it is only about a 5 minute or less walk from our Apartment. I have read every review on here pertaining to this establishment and most of it remains true despite the fact it has been almost 2 weeks since it has been open. We arrived at about 11:00am and we were seated fairly quickly. The server came pretty quickly and got us some water and I had the coffee which is just average.   It took us about 5 to 7 minutes to decide what to order and the server took our order at about 11:15am. I ordered the Pancake Combo with one egg scrambled....and turkey sausage. My wife had the Chorizo and eggs which came with home fries. So after about 30 minutes waiting for our food to arrive.....the owner or manager....which was an elderly lady... came out to each table an apologized for the long wait and offered us some oink cookies. She explained that when they were planning the business structure that she was told there would be several customers in the area that would come to this type of establishment. However there have been hundreds of people showing up and they were not prepared for that.  She also expressed there have been some issues with the cooking staff....arguing back and forth about who should be preparing what....and how it should be prepared....there are some huge communication issues that need to be worked out. Finally at about 12:05pm we finally received our food....so that means it took about an hour from the time we first ordered. Now since we live so close to this establishment I didn't mind the wait.....however had I come say 20 minutes away....I wouldn't want to wait an hour to have breakfast.   The Food was OUTSTANDING.....DELICIOUS.....AWESOME.....so there were no problems in this area at all. Now if this establishment can just get better organized....because we had to ask for silverware.....napkins....straws....and butter for my pancakes.....and get the communication issues squared away in the kitchen....this will be a guaranteed 5 star establishment. So by all means if your in the east valley and are looking for a place to have a GREAT TASTING....MADE TO ORDER breakfast....give the Oink Cafe a try. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!  NOTE: Just another FYI the elderly lady came back after we finished our breakfast and offered us a wonder piece of sour creme pecan coffee cake....so she was really trying to make customers feel comfortable and apologize for our wait. You have to appreciate that kind of service and her honesty about the situation....I truly believe this place will have great success once they fix some of there issues!!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty food and a good assortment of mimosas! Wish they had a mimosa special though. I need to come again to try out the flight of bacon!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place and the concept is a great one but it didn't live up to its potential. The service here was sub par, it was really busy and a little longer wait is fine. Our waitress never returned to fill our drinks, never checked to see if we needed anything and had to be flagged down in order to get our check. Like I said they were busy and I'll gladly make exceptions for that but being completely ignored is unacceptable to me.   The food was only ok as well. We ordered a flight of bacon, which is supposed to be the backbone of the menu. All of the samples were good but none of them were great. In most cases I wouldn't be able to distinguish it from store bought bacon, with the peppered bacon as the exception.   Both of our breakfast items were ok, a little on the bland side. Nothing worth complaining about or sending back but also nothing that would make me come running back. Overall it reminded me of a small town greasy spoon diner that was trying desperately to be a trendy uptown bistro."}
{"text":"Food here is fantastic, service needs a lot of help.  From the hostess who doesn't have control to servers who aren't managing their tables.  That said, if you are looking for good food and have an hour or so for breakfast or lunch, this is a don't miss in the east valley.  The bonus is patio seating.  Just bring your patience."}
{"text":"I've been going here for breakfast since they opened. Everything I've had has been really good. My favorites are the biscuits and gravy, PV omelet  with egg whites, Oink Waffle. The cafe mocha is awesome too. The service has always been friendly and fast."}
{"text":"How is it that I've never reviewed this place before? As many times as I go, I would have thought I'd done Oink.   Oink is not to be missed. It is a great and funky little breakfast joint that specializes in one thing... Can you guess? BACON!   Ok, let's make this clear - everything they make us good. They would be a success even with out the bacon. And the service is great. Some of the employees have been there for years. When you meet them you will understand. They love this place too. I like to see that level of investment.   But the BACON - that stuff is crazy good. They do \"Bacon Flights\" where you get to see and taste all different kinds of bacon. And I still can't pick a favorite."}
{"text":"The service impeccable; spot on, friendly, quick, that alone is worth the trip. Now add the food! Even the decor! Will be a frequent flyer."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on Father's Day and had a wonderful experience! The waitress had a bright and welcoming personality, the coffee was fresh, my breakfast was kept simple, though flavorful...everything was lovely! I really enjoy the fact they offer gluten free items because it's a real pain finding restaurants that have those options! The waitress was helpful in catering to my food allergy needs with patience and I greatly appreciated that. I definitely recommend stopping in for breakfast if you're ever in the area!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast joint - we live 10 miles away but this is always where we go.  Oink Café French Toast is my favorite.  They also have a plate of 8 kinds of bacon which my husband loves.  I have not had anything here that I have not liked, I do want to try more items but always crave the French toast when I walk in, the sweet potato fries are also great - sometimes I get a side with my French Toast.  They are only open for breakfast and lunch which is a downside for me as I would have no problem going more than once in a day.  The hostess on the weekend, a young girl is pretty slow but the food is beyond worth it.  I have recommended this place to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Food is awesome... Service was really bad and that was disappointing.  We didn't even get our coffee or waters until the food arrived.  I had an omelet and it was great.  My kids love the pigs in a blanket.  Only concern was 10 minutes to be greeted and 20 for our drinks!?!"}
{"text":"The Oink is my family's favorite restaurant.  The staff is friendly and the food is great.  It's our version of \"Cheers\"....everyone knows our name when we walk through the door!"}
{"text":"We felt that the yelp reviews underrated this place. Been three times now. Service is a little slow because they're very busy. The food is good! Lots of bacon everything including different flavors of bacon. We like the applewood the best. Go Eat Here!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to the Oink Cafe for breakfast. They have a few dishes that I really like, especially the Arizona Omelette. That one is a little spicy and really good. The service is usually really good, sometimes a little slow if they're really busy. But that's to be expected anywhere you go. After some recent disappointments with other breakfast places, finally a restaurant where everything is just right. Keep it up, I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"All around amazing food and great staff!! I highly recommend the French toast and Californian omelet! My other favorite is a breakfast appetizer which is the bacon flight! Before you leave you have to get yourself a maple bacon doughnut, so good!  My go to breakfast joint every weekend!:)"}
{"text":"Maybe a busy Saturday morning is not The Oink Cafe at its best...but then it should be at its best on a busy Saturday. Yes, they have 8 varieties of bacon. Mine was no bigger or better than the bacon I had earlier in the week at Wendy's. The potatoes were dry and tasted like frozen from the bag. Coffee was good. One of my guests ordered a Bloody Mary--I couldn't help but notice that she only drank half, too polite to say anything negative. Waitress was friendly."}
{"text":"For a business that is all about their bacon, it is rather disappointing!  The atmosphere is great and fun.  The service was decent, it was moderately busy, but the waitresses seemed overworked and not very enthusiastic.  But the bacon is what I had a problem with most!!  The signs all around the business talk about bacon and how they have 8 different flavors to try.  So, I ordered a full flight of bacon, one piece of all 8 flavors.  To say it was impressive would be a lie.  Most of the flavors tasted very similar, while a couple of them had no taste at all.  I did like the flavors of the Jalapeño and Apple Cider bacon, but the rest were rather \"run of the mill\".  The biggest turn-off was the size of the bacon, it was so small and not worth the value!  For an 8-piece plate, it costs $8.99!  That's over $1 a slice and they were so small!  I was expecting some thick cuts of bacon, something that would be a mouthful and give you a full sense of their quality food, but it was rather the opposite.  I don't think I will be going back there again.  For the same price, I could have ordered an entire meal, instead what I got was a medium-sized snack."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Service was on point and you made my bacon loving fiancée very happy. We can't say enough about Oink, except we will see you again next weekend.. And the week after that and the following .. Etc!"}
{"text":"First time here....we live within 5 minutes but have waited to visit to allow them some time to work out the initial kinks of a new restaurant based on previous Yelp reviews.  We got there around 10:00'ish on a Sunday morning.  We were seated right away and got our drinks right away.  Restaurant did not seem overly busy to me. We had some questions about the menu, got them answered and placed our order.  We ordered the Paradise Valley Omelette and the Steak and Eggs.  It took 27 minutes for them to deliver our first entree'. The omelette was hot off the press, steaming and had some really nice hot, stringy cheese.  The Steak and Eggs was a completely different story.  The steak was cold, overcooked and tough.  Enough said so I sent it back. My next entree' (Eggs Benedict) came out in 5 minutes and it looked great.  However, the English Muffin was barely toasted, the ham was super thin, and the Hollandaise was tasty but it basically formed a pool on the plate.  There were some positives.  We ordered a side of the Jalepeno Bacon and it was really good.  I had the side of Biscuits and Gravy on the Steak and Eggs entree and the biscuits were good.  You could tell they were homemade.  Also, the homemade sausage gravy was great.  Our waitress was really great and really seemed to know the menu well.  She did comp the Eggs Benedict entree after we talked about how weak the Steak and Eggs came out from the kitchen.  The food runner needed some help in a big way....I just kept seeing him flash in and out of the kitchen and running through the dining room.   The bakery items looked really good so I might go back to try them sometime in the future.   Overall, I'd say about 2.5 stars but I've definitely had better breakfasts at other restaurants in the area.  I'm not completely convinced that I'd go back unless I knew it was going to be a better overall experience."}
{"text":"Good breakfast items but the bacon is clearly the star in this place.  I love jalapeno bacon and this place does it up right.  The flight of bacon is a great idea.  Maple and bacon donuts?  Heck yeah."}
{"text":"Slightly above average breakfast joint with a few distinctive items.  The servings are more generous than average and service is good.  They have a full bar and of course you have to try the bacon bloody mary!  Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"OMG- I LOVE Oink. And I hate breakfast restaurants. So I guess that says a lot.   Tried it out on a whim one day and now I crave it- they have the BEST french toast. My husband rotates between pigs in a blanket and bacon pancakes. I initially was skeptical, especially after reading reviews. But, it's right across the street from an IHOP so I figured that they probably had something unique going on if they have been able to keep their lights on.   Once we decided to go in there and give Oink a try, I knew that we'd make a good choice. The pastry case with the bacon-maple donuts caught my attention, and It kept getting better- we received excellent service and ate excellent food. I'm really not sure why there aren't more 5 star reviews. One of these days, I'm going to have to be bad and get one of those donuts. Their pastry case seriously looks amazing, if you're trying to become a diabetic at breakfast.   We travel with a 1-year-old, so eating out is hard. Oink is the perfect place for us to go grab breakfast because it's noisy (read, always full), so I don't worry about my loud and messy baby, and it's fast (we have never been there more than 45 minutes from beginning to end.) It's always busy when we're there, but not too busy- longest wait I've had has been 5 minutes. We've gone there a handful of times since the first, and have never had the bad service people talk about, but maybe that's because we go early, closer to 8 (and we miss the after church crowd.) If you go in the winter months, be sure to sit on the patio- not much to look at (in the Target parking lot) but much more quiet."}
{"text":"I come to Oink often and always wonder why.  The good is great but today is a great example of 1 star.  The back of the house is great but the front of the house is horrible.  I get weekends are busy. I've been in Scottsdale / Paradise Valley long enough to understand weekend wait times.  Here's the deal today.  Waited twenty minutes so far for a table with a lot of other people. As I stand here, there are NINE unoccupied, unbussed tables including FOUR that needed bussing when we arrived here twenty minutes ago.  Many others in town I won't name handle a far greater Sat/Sun load without issue.  I really want to like Oink but the front end mismanagement is terrible.  I've watched five parties walk away while we've been waiting. I'll go somewhere else from now on."}
{"text":"My girl friend was talking about going here. So we decided to make it a choice after a 5K marathon.  Hungry and tired we decided to stop my Oink.... they bragged about having 8 different types of bacon.   So let's see....  As we walked in  there was a cute waitress who made  sure to tell us there is a 20 mins wait....  not bad on a brunch Sunday!   We finally got seated and I grabbed the menu.  Let's see... I need a cup of coffee first....  now let's order.    I decided to get the classic home fries, eggs and their famous peppered bacon. Of course I ordered the butter milk biscuit.  The price was great.... that plate was $7.99. Perfect price if you have a large family.   I turned to see the waitress heading towards me with a tray full of goodness. As she placed the plate in front of me. I was completely DISAPPOINTED the bacon was so thin and  wilted.  I imagined thick slices of pepper dipped bacon....   SORRY.... I received the saddest looking bacon in all of bacon land. Let's not start on the home fries which were hard and burnt.   I moved all of my food around to make it look like I ate something.  I was so hungry I just had to eat it.  As tears were welling up in my eyes.  I began to eat the worse breakfast I have had in about a year.  Look advertising bacon should mean I'm in bacon heaven not BACON HELL....   I wouldn't return for there breakfast maybe their sandwiches are better but I don't think I would try that either.    Walking down disappointed lane!"}
{"text":"BACON...need I say more?? i enjoy the smell of the bacon as it makes it's way into the air and over to where I live. I love coming here for breakfast and lunch. All the gals there are friendly and the service is good. In fact today when I mentioned to the owner's brother that I had not tried the apple cider (it was jalapeno for me today) he went and got me some to try - that's treating the customer right!"}
{"text":"Worst breakfast experience of my life. I come from the restaurant industry and usually cut people a good deal of slack. After my breakfast being prepared incorrectly 4 times the owner refused to apologize and said that my breakfast only went back to the kitchen twice. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Great management here. Everyone is so friendly and welcoming, waitresses hostesses and even the managers. Love it! Yummy food too!!!"}
{"text":"It was the last meet up for the Breakfast Club UYE for the year and Oink Café was the place that was picked!  I'm not a big pork eating fool, but I love me some BACON!!! How can you not love BACON! It's the best thing on the planet! So I was pretty stoked to be headed to Oink.  I do have to say they make a mean up cup of coffee, I drink my coffee black unless its whack then I doc it up, but Oink's was perfectly great straight up black!   I ordered the bacon stuffed pancake with a side of bacon, I had been picturing thick slices of apple wood smoked bacon ( I don't know why it was apple wood smoked in my head, but it just was) and I couldn't wait to get my teeth into it! What I got was a slice on the thin side, it was cooked the way like, not too crispy, not too soft, just wasn't what I was expecting. But the bacon stuffed pancakes OOOMMMMGGGG!!! Every bite was loaded with bacon, it was SWEET BLISS!! Maple syrup drenched pancakes loaded with salty pieces of bacon; it was heaven, pure heaven! All pancakes should be that way! haha  I also ordered a dozen bacon donut holes for my son, who is a bacon lovin fool too.  I enjoyed my breakfast and look forward to coming back for some more of them bacon stuffed pancakes!"}
{"text":"This place used to be packed. But now with all the new breakfast joints popping up in the same area  I can understand why it's dead on a Thursday morning. Food is mediocre at best. Reminds me of an old truck stop diner. The bacon is good though I will give them that. But was REALLY pissed me off was not telling me of the actual up charge to add an item to your order. $3 for 4 thin slices of tomato?? I mean c'mon. **It's deceptive to not disclose the actual cost of the up charge!"}
{"text":"Went on a sun morning. Short wait before being seated. Fun atmosphere and theme. Expected more bacon or pork themed items. Ordered chicken fried steak based on another review here. Very good, Highly recommend! Finished with a maple/bacon doughnut, pretty good. Will return"}
{"text":"Have been here twice now for breakfast. I've had the blueberry pancakes and huevos rancheros. I love all of their different options for bacon. My favorites are the jalepeno and the apple cider! Friendly staff, good food, and fast service. All in all a good experience! I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Love the bacon varieties; jalapeño is my favorite! Waffles are wonderful. House potatoes are grand. Service is prompt, polite and servers don't interrupt your conversation to ask if you need anything else!"}
{"text":"Extremely rude host staff.  Very surprised at the way I was spoken to.  Food was average,  not a place I would visit again."}
{"text":"Yum! This brunch joint is a good spot to have tasty breakfast or lunch with a tasty bloody. They have a spicy tai bloody that is absolutely delicious. The coffee is very good, and I don't like to drink coffee a lot... the food is fair portioned and they have a large breakfast menu to pick from. I love coming here."}
{"text":"The Oink omelette and bacon glazed doughnuts are really good. Service is top notch.  A bonus is that the owner has experience with peanut allergies and is really conscious of avoiding peanuts in his restaurant.  I have a family member that is allergic to peanuts so the owner's assurances are a bonus."}
{"text":"We love Oink! Sunday breakfast is always great here. We hate to wait to be seated but who doesn't.  You know it's good, that's why you wait. Usually only 15/20 mins. Food is always yummy and the kids enjoy the food too. Ok to take the toddler also, who looooves their maple bacon donut holes! Lol..."}
{"text":"First and last time here... hostesses were rude. Especially the elderly woman who was presumably supervising was rude,  and although Sundays are understandably busy, I don't think she should let her frustrations translate through to her guests.  We were quoted us the wrong wait time of 25 min after 39min when we asked were advised of would be another 35 min in a very abrasive manner.  We left and we won't find out if the food was worth the wait because of the rudeness of the host staff.  When spending $ service is almost as important as the food"}
{"text":"The food is great here but the hostesses tend to underestimate the wait time. That wouldn't be so bad if the air condition temp was set lower. It feels like a sauna while you wait."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast, and the jalapeno bacon is awesome!! I go there every chance I get, which unfortunately, is not often enough!  I haven't tried lunch there yet, but I'm sure it would be great as well!"}
{"text":"Pros: Good amount of choices for menu options, including a full coffee service menu.  Staff was friendly.  Food was good - I had the waffle combo.   Cons: Noisy and a little on top of each other as far as table space.  There was a wait and no real place to stand and wait other than outside.  A touch overpriced for breakfast food, making them a bit less competitive for the surrounding area.  Overall: B+  Not the best breakfast place we have been to in Phoenix, but most certainly not the worst.  We'll be back for the bacon flight!"}
{"text":"We came specifically for the lattes and bacon because I love bacon and hubby loves lattes. We go there on a weekday morning and surprisingly, they were pretty busy. We were told to seat ourselves and so once we did, it took some time to be greeted  by our server.   I ordered a hot hazelnut latte and hubby ordered an iced vanilla latte. The server dropped off two hot lattes and so I told him one was iced. The hazelnut latte was okay but the vanilla latte was pretty good. We decided to share the Paradise Valley omelet (spinach, mushrooms, bacon and cheddar cheese). The omelet came with hash browns and wheat toast. Then, we ordered 1/2 bacon flight: apple cider, applewood smoked, jalapeño and hickory.   Between the both of us, the omelet entree portion was generous and we couldn't even finish. The omelet was really good- big slices of mushrooms and lots of cheese! I think the whole bacon flight thing is a little overrated. The jalapeño bacon and applewood smoked was good, but $4.99 for four slices and they weren't even crunchy?! Maybe they should add the bacon to an entree or something instead and then you choose which ones you want.   Our server was pretty slow in getting us our check and checking us out, but our bill was inexpensive and we really enjoyed our meal and lattes."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and ordered the flight of bacon and the signature oink french toast. The french toast was very good and I would order it again. The bacon on the other hand was nothing to brag about. The flavors were very subtle and it wasn't crispy enough in my opinion.  I would come here again to try some of the other dishes but I'll probably get the sausage."}
{"text":"Had a few good meals there, but I had to update my review though from 4 stars to 2, we won't be back. We sat there for over 30 minutes with no food, people that arrived after us were eating and the waitress only acknowledged that our food wasn't ready yet, but it was obvious we were forgotten about.  Since we only had waters and no one was around for us to ask about the status of the meal we just left. Hungry and frustrated with wasting 45 minutes we will have to find a new breakfast place. I work in a restaurant and i know that stuff happens, some communication could have made a world of difference."}
{"text":"So the server started off with a positive bang. She was friendly etc...we ordered the omelette w bacon spinach cheese ok. The hashbrowns were frozen type small tiny portion cold and over done. I had the oink french toast. Nice could not taste the cornflake crunch. Because it was over cooked. One strawberry cut into tiny pieces and you get 5 blueberries on top. Two dried up pieces of bacon. Oink is the name of the place. Bacon lost me there. Finally we had a coupon from the entertainment book she says oh you got a bargain today. Lady don't count my money. It was our first time there we wanted to use our book. They should not say the food is homemade when you know they are not. Oh well you eat and learn...."}
{"text":"We love Oink! The breakfasts are hearty and affordable and their coffee bar is amazing (try the mocha! Iced or hot!!) the bacon is the gimmick that gets you in the door but you stay for the great service and delicious food. It's definitely a restaurant I wish I could visit more often!"}
{"text":"This was a last minute lunch decision as we were passing by. We were a bit late to the game since they closed at 2 and it was 1:45. Regardless of the time, they were quick to welcome us and get us seated. For it being almost closing time, they were still quite busy.  My husband and I both ordered the oink signature bloody mary. The flavor was very good and it came with olives and bacon. I decided on breakfast and went pretty simple with the eggs, hash browns, and jalapeño bacon. The bacon...oh the bacon...was absolutely delicious. The rest of the breakfast was good but the big standout here was the jalapeño bacon.  My husband got the chicken avocado sandwich and said it was amazing. It came with coleslaw which he also said was very good.   We will absolutely come back for the Bloody Mary, mimosa, and bacon flight!"}
{"text":"What happened? This place was so great a couple years ago.. now the staff leaves something to be desired... Still like the food, hope staff gets a rearrangement."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place out after seeing the reviews. Specializing in bacon? How can anything be wrong with that? We walked in on a Friday morning, around 10 am, and 90's rap was blaring through the empty restaurant. I mean LOUD. So, a little strange, but no big deal, we decided to sit outside. We looked at the menu and decided. I ordered the PV omelet and my husband chose the Belgian waffles. The food came out quickly and everything was really good. As we sat outside, we noticed broken glass at our feet. When the server came over to check on us, we told her about the glass, and she told us that it had been there since the previous morning. This made me a bit nervous--I worked at a corporate restaurant for many years and broken glass was like a 5 alarm fire. Also, I am very pregnant, so the glass at my sandaled feet made my husband nervous. After we told the server about the glass, she sent a kitchen guy out with a broom, but he swept the other side of the patio, no where near the glass. She said he would clean up the glass once we left, but then quickly sat the table next to us, also surrounded by glass. This in not a huge deal, but oversights such as this at a new restaurant make me a bit nervous about what else might be overlooked.  The food and service was good, and we may return."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to come here for quite some time now! So with us being able to squeeze in a Sunday brunch, we were finally able to come here. The wait was long and I believe we were quoted 20 minutes but I believe it was closer to 30 minutes. Once seated we were taken very good care of by our waitress. And, with that said that is my biggest complaint! If you have read any of my reviews in the past then you know I don't like to waste calories on bad food. Lucky for me this was a winning meal all around. Unbutton your top button on your pants and enjoy the ride. Eat like a pig if you want! You only live once! With that in mind, we went full fledge into the menu! We ordered the 10 piece bacon flight that featured 10 different bacon slices. Ok, we shared it! My absolute favorites were the Jalapeno, apple cider and the pecan wood slices. Hubby was a fan of the hickory. Pass the bacon, please! I also ordered the raspberry latte which was quite tasty. On to the main course: Hubby ordered the Oink Omelet with potatoes and toast. The omelet was a great size and quite enjoyable, although I wasn't given a bite I can attest to his enjoyment of it. I ordered the biscuits and gravy because that is something I would never make at home. It was without a doubt the best I've ever had and a great size portion. I loved the freshness of the biscuits! No salt or pepper needed.The potatoes were wonderful as well. Neither of us was able to complete our meal! That usually doesn't happen at breakfast. The bill was over $45 so it was a definite splurge in every sense of the word, but for the portion size and quality of the food, I feel it was worth it. The biggest thing they could improve on is wait time and opening up the patio area to diners who might not mind sitting outside in our AZ heat."}
{"text":"Walked in and instantly loved this spot. Was clean and yummy goodies. #Baconlover all welcome. :) Came around 930am on a Sun day and their were pretty busy inside and outside. Ordered espresso and goodies, will come back for breakfast as soon as possible. Decorations were layed out nice and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"My favorite local huevos rancheros! My family likes the chicken fried steak. Coffee is excellent. Get there before 9am on weekend or you'll wait 45 minutes."}
{"text":"This is where you go to get yer pig on, I'm talking bacon mania.  A wide variety of delicious breakfast plates, most of which feature that crispy delight, will satisfy ANY appetite. This place proves the old adage that 'bacon makes everything better'."}
{"text":"For one the service here was piss poor. There was no hostess at the front and when we did get seated they didn't explain they serve both breakfast and lunch at the time (we thought it was only lunch until we overheard other ppl ordering breakfast after we had ordered). The booth was squished together where we got sat at. Then the server took forever to come over, when she did she apologized and gave this lengthy story about not knowing who was cut (I don't care). There was 2 servers, one was in training (I'm assuming) and this wasn't explained either. The server never got my drink refill and also managed to screw up my order. The flight of bacon all tasted the same for the most part and their tomato soup wasn't great (how do you screw up tomato soup)? I will not be going back here-I've had better bacon and food elsewhere and service was pretty bad."}
{"text":"Kitschy name, cute concept, a little indie place in an area consumed by monolithic chains -- Oink really had all the potential in the world.   The space is simple, open, and clean, although very sparse --  what some may interpret as modern simply reeked of half-assedness to me. \"Hey, let's throw some pink paint on one wall and call it a day!\" The bathrooms had fancy schmancy modern sinks and fixtures, although the weekly cleaning form on the back of the door was, disconcertingly, completely blank.  The service was super average, better than I expected considering I had heard it was atrocious. My breakfast-loving SO and I did our usual, each of us getting our own separate egg things followed by a shared short stack of blueberry pancakes. My omelet was nice, steaming hot and full of nice fresh veggies. The home fries on the side, though, were cold. The English muffin was barely toasted, also cold, and so slathered in butter it was slippery. My SO inhaled most of his Hollandaise-slathered Benedict, but let's face it, he'd slurp down a dog turd if it was drenched in Hollandaise. The pancakes were completely and utterly unremarkable, as was the OJ (watery and bitter) and coffee.   The sucker punch was the bill: with tip, over $40 for two for breakfast. If I wanted to shell out $40 for breakfast, I would stay in my own hood and go to Taylor's where I know the food will be spectacular and the service top-notch. Alternatively, I could go to IHOP across the street, where I know the food will be reliably above average for half the price.  Sorry, Oink, your prices make you little piggies. You've gotta step up your game, because no one wants to pay Paradise Valley prices for a Glendale experience."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come here for the longest time and this morning we had such an awesome experience here. The cafe is designed so cute and the staff is all smiles! We were sat right away, the waiter was very attentive and friendly. The mimosa's were delicious and strong. :) We ordered biscuits and gravy which were phenomenal and a side of french toast to share which was also delicious. You get a big portion and the food quality was great. Thank you too Sean for stopping by our table to make us laugh and make small talk, he was so nice! I definitely recommend this breakfast spot and I will be back! You won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"Well we could hardly wait to try this place that promised all these kinds of bacon and new flavors. Well we went the place was packed we ordered two different plates with two flavors of bacon on them.  Well we could not discern any difference in flavor. In fact both were near flavorless. It appeared the bacon had been in the deep fryer. The eggs were overlooked as well.   All in all passable and we will pass it up.  If you are in a hurry it is ok. But if not head to BoBo's"}
{"text":"Oink how we love you. Let us count the way... 1. Bacon. 2. More bacon. 3. A great place to dine with your furry family members. I usually meet here with friends and family twice a month."}
{"text":"I'm really not the type to want to go out for breakfast, I'd rather save my dining money for lunch or dinner because I figure I can usually make just as good of a breakfast at home.  However, there is no way I could match their french toast, it is just outstanding.  We have been twice and I ordered that both times.  The first time, I told the waitress to put the berry sauce on the side because I usually don't like fruit toppings, they are too sweet and fake tasting.   But this sauce is delicious! It is homemade and very natural tasting, I ate every bit of it.  We also loved the jalepeno bacon.  My kids loved the pigs in a blanket.  We had very nice service both times, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"bacon, bacon, and more bacon!  If you're a fan of bacon, and love breakfasty/lunchy places, then this place is for you. The menu is chock full of all your breakfast favorites. One of us got the eggs benedict with applewood smoked bacon. It was very good, with the eggs poached flawlessly.  Another got a lunch sandwich... Turkey, lettuce, tomato, and of course, bacon! apple cider bacon to be precise. The turkey was real roast turkey, not the slimy deli stuff.  I'm definitely a fan and will certainly return!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and hungry, so I we decided to give this place a try.   This location is at the corner of Cactus and Paradise Valley Parkway in a shopping center with Target and REI. Parking is shared with all the businesses in the shopping center, but there is plenty of parking spaces to accommodate all the customers in the area.   From the outside, this place appears to be much larger then it actually is. When we got inside, it was very busy and almost every table was occupied. Asked the hostess how long the wait would be and she was able to seat us immediately. Note, this place is only open till 2 pm and we got there at 1 and it didn't die down any within the hour we were there. Not sure if they actually stay open past that though, as people were still coming in 5 minutes before closing time.   Once seated, we only had to wait about 5 minutes before our waitress came by and took our order. Both of us just got water, so she was able to bring it to us immediately. However, our food order took about 15-20 minutes to come out. I ordered the Roasted Turkey Sandwich ($10.49) which is a double decker of house roasted turkey, lettuce, tomato, and mayo on rye bread and came with a side of fries. I was very disappointed with the sandwich! Bread was good and toasted perfectly, but the turkey was dry and had no flavor. Lettuce was wilted and little to no mayo on the bread. Fries were tasty, but were not crispy at all. Definitely wouldn't order this item again. My date ordered the Ranchero Chimichanga ($11.49), which is filled with Pork confit, ranchero beans, home fries, and cheddar cheese rolled up in a flour tortilla and fried crispy. Topped with chorizo cheese sauce and served with your choice of side. He got the fries. He said it was very tasty and would get it again. However, the size is very large, so he was so stuffed after eating the Chimichanga, that he wasn't able to even touch the fries.   Our waitress came by only once to check to see if we needed anything else and to give us our check. It was a good thing we didn't need anything, as she was very busy with half of the tables and people always asking for more stuff. Even though she was very busy, she always greeted her customers with a smile. I could tell she was tired, but still she worked as hard and as efficiently as possible.  Tables were immediately cleaned off and set up for the next customers to be seated, floors also were constantly swept. However, the ladies bathroom was another story. Trash was overflowing on to the floor and it needed to be swept and mopped as there was water all over the floor! Toilet paper also needed to be refilled.   Probably would come here again, but maybe as a last resort. Just not really my type of food."}
{"text":"A flight of bacon???? Whoever came up with that is a genius! I LOVE this place! I swear whoever came up with this chain had a bacon loving person like me in mind. I had the regular bacon along with the hickory smoked flavor bacon. Both were great. My boyfriend tried the jalepeno bacon as well. We were definitely happy with our selections and are looking forward to going back. It was busy, as most great places are. Expect a little wait, but I guarantee it is worth it!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love bacon so I had the try the different types they offer here. I got the biscuit breakfast sandwich with hash browns and the half flight of bacon with applewood smoked, apple cider, sugar, honey, and hickory. Given that this is a bacon place, you expect it to be a bit of a greasy spoon, but this was way over the top. The hashbrowns were dripping in grease and were a little flat. My biscuit was tasteless unless you count baking powder as a flavour, Pillsbury from a can would be a better option. The bacon was good but inconsistent in how it was cooked - some pieces were overdone and some were under and fatty. I liked all the different flavours but honey and applewood smoked were my favourites. I liked the pig serving plate and that we were given a guide to which pieces were which flavour. The coffee was good, which was a nice surprise, and service was very fast and friendly. Overall, a fun place to try but I couldn't make it my go-to without a bit of improvement from the kitchen."}
{"text":"I needed a quick place to stop for coffee before a work obligation and saw Oink from the street. Always looking to throw money anywhere but Starbucks, I made both a sharp turn and new enemies in traffic to get my ass there.   No wait to be seated, I took a seat out on the shaded patio and grabbed a maple bacon donut and a latte. Donut was warm and covered with a Ron Swanson worthy amount of the crispy bacon. Latte was yummy!  They showed me a menu and it all escalated so quickly ... suddenly I found myself in front of eggs, home fries, and two strips of the monthly special, Pecanwood Glazed Bacon.  I would put a baby in that bacon. I'd make an honest woman out of that bacon. You get the idea.   Order your home fries extra hot as tiny potatoes don't insulate themselves very well. The food was awesome and the service was CRAZY FRIENDLY: warm, but without the zeal of a used car salesman.  Eat here! Get bacon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten at Oink Cafe twice. First time was the week they opened, early on a Thursday morning. Food was good, service was fine, but there was only one other customer besides us. Today we went there at 7:30 on Saturday, the place was almost empty when we got there but quickly filled up. First off, they were out of their homemade turkey sausage, that I wanted to try. I changed my order to Huevos Rancheros, and was really disappointed. The eggs were fine, but the beans were greasy, I could see a layer of lard floating on top of them. At $8.99 I thought it was really over priced. My husband had the pancake combo with bacon, he thought the bacon was over cooked, and the pancakes were almost raw, they were gummy and severly undercooked. As for service, our coffee was never refilled, once our food was dropped off we were completely ignored until the check was left. Customers around us were complaining, the woman behind us had to order her tea 3 times before it arrived, the man behind us complained that his order was wrong, many customers seemed unhappy with the wait and the service. I was really disappointed, I realize that they have only been open a couple of weeks, so we might return in a few months, if they survive that long. It's really too bad, I like small, locally owned restaurants, but the experience today was so bad that I'm not in any hurry to return. They got 2 stars, because our first visit was fine."}
{"text":"My kids say this is the happiest place on earth! I'll have to admit its awesome. No better place to have the best breakfast in PV!!"}
{"text":"I don't know if I'd go back. The last time we were there they told us the wait would be 20 minutes and we wait 55 minutes. I timed it because it was so, so long. They did a good job on compensating us for it but it was still really unfortunate. We've been other times and the food is just ok each time."}
{"text":"I like the place but can't say it's anything to write home about as a breakfast joint. I will say the Mac n cheese is amazing though. I like that they have different bacon flavors, but for a place that focuses on bacon it seems low quality. I was expecting thick and yummy, just seems skinny and meh."}
{"text":"Had a breakfast meeting here once and never decided to go back. Service was great but the food wasn't worth it. The eggs felt like it was made out of a microwave and the gravy just wasn't to my standards. Let's just say I wont be trying this place again."}
{"text":"On Sundays, get here early. Food is good. Staff is very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try The Oink for a while now.  We meet some friends there for breakfast.  We were all disappointed. Service was terrible, we had to ask for coffee several times, the coffee had no taste. One person ordered a waffle and when it was served it was so cold the butter wouldn't even melt, we had to send it back. The food took a long time to be served. The waitress was polite but looked unkept about her appearance.  I don't think a person waiting on you should be wearing a sweatshirt.  What happened to looking good at your job no matter what it is.  It would be nice having a person serving your food to look presentable. All five of us decided we will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"First time here...love their motto...\"Breakfast, Lunch and Bacon\". Visited with my boyfriend and his 2 children. Enjoyed the food a lot. Had breakfast of an omlette filled with spinich, red and green bell peppers and turkey sausage. It was quite yummy.  Also tried their maple glazed bacon doughnut....talk about sinful! It was so wonderful. They had run out, but had made more just for us. That was worth the wait.  Service was pretty good with just a few mess  ups....but when I asked for a special order it was granted without fuss. Overall it was a good experience and I will go again."}
{"text":"Great food and fabulous service!  Wonderful dog friendly patio and all of the wait staff including the manager came out to say hello to the dogs.  They make a great Chai Tea. They have something on the menu for everyone.  Good location and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Visited on a Sunday Morning and it was busy. 25 minute wait. Service was ok as was the food. Strip mall atmosphere and Perkins food quality. The place is busy so it is a good value, just nothing special about it."}
{"text":"Good breakfast place. Open, bright space with friendly staff. Good healthy choice omelette and wonderful biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"We came here for a late breakfast and it was great! The blood mary was AMAZING and you HAVE to order the Bacon Flight. Also get your bloody mary with the jalapeno bacon. We enjoyed our food and the service was on par with a cafe. The prices are right! :)"}
{"text":"Okay, so my rating is a 3.5, and typically I round down. But for this place i rounded up because they prepared the hashbrowns how i like it. Thin and crispy.  They had delicious benedict. I love their hollandaise they used. Definitely worked its way into my top 2 of favorite hollandaise.   I really hope to try some more dishes, here."}
{"text":"Awesome place... My wife brought some of their bacon home and it was delicious (recommend the jalapeño bacon). We were seated quickly and our server (Nikol) got our coffees right away. BTW they do carry heavy cream for us fat connoisseurs. I ordered the Oink omelette, a 5-egg bacon sausage filled monster (see pic). Great food, great service. Give them a try if your by PV mall..."}
{"text":"The bank trial was amazing but the best was the donut covered with bacon, it was to die for! I loved the capitan crunch toast too! I wish I would have tried the bloody mary but I didnt see it until we left. It gives me a reason to go back again! Super fun and super delicious. Very kid friendly too!"}
{"text":"All the people who've complained are just snobby cry babies who were more than likely that kid who screamed in the parking lot at their parents for the $300 pink pony to match his/her purple, orange, yellow, green, and blue ones that already reside in their bedroom windowsill.  Service? Seen way worse..Food? I'm the biggest skeptic when it comes to getting your money's worth and tend to complian like the pony girl/guy. Nitpick at everything. Ok hypocrisy, yes. Be that as it may, I still have to admit that their bacon cheese burger has to be by far the best I have had in a long long time.  Keep it up guys. Wish you had dinner hours. Let's get rid of Denny's and IHOP crap.    P.S. They do have alcohol"}
{"text":"With the slogan of \"breakfast, lunch, and bacon\", I would expect the restaurant to have multiple interesting and fun dishes with a focus on quality bacon. If this is what you are looking for, do not visit oink.   The service was ok, family run it seemed. A little disorganized, but it hasn't been open long so I'm sure that this will get better.  The food is standard breakfast and lunch. Most items do not include bacon as an ingredient and there are only 1-2 fun bacon dishes (such as bacon pancakes).  I ordered the French toast combo with honey cured bacon and hash browns. The French toast was ok, pretty typical. The hash browns were not fully cooked and the bacon was not very impressive and tasted like the cheap stuff you pick up at your local grocery store.  I strongly recommend that the owner check out some good bacon focused meat companies such as Broadbent, who has an amazing dry-cured bacon. If you like good bacon, join the zingerman's bacon club which will introduce you into several tasty varieties from across the country.  Oink should rethink its menu and name and try to bring the two in line with each other.   Good luck oink, the idea is great but execution needs a little work."}
{"text":"I thought I should write an update, as since my first visit 4 months ago I have dined there abput 8 times.  My experiences have never been as good as my first visit.  The omelet has not once been fluffy like the first time.  Since I cook a lot, cooking a flat omelet isn't a challenge so I'd just as soon keep the $20 in my pocket.  In addition, the last time I visited I ordered a side of bacon and it was delivered cold - not warm, cold, cooked but cold.  The restaurant was not busy, perhaps 35% capacity.  Flat omelets and cold bacon isn't worth the price.  I don't think I'll return, too many other places to try."}
{"text":"What a great place!  Went there for breakfast while in town.  The day we went a local television station was there doing a live shot.  Despite that we were greeted and  seated as soon as we walked in.  The waitress was very friendly without bring overbearing.  The Bacon Bloody Mary was one of the best I have ever had.  Our food came out quickly.  It was very full of flavor.  The flight of bacon was excellent.  The Ranchero Sauce was made by someone who really knew what they were doing.  The taste was exciting and full of flavor.  The servings were plentiful without leaving me feeling like I ate too much.  The owner stopped at our table despite the large crowd that was on hand to say hello and check on us. An excellent place which will be on my short list to visit again."}
{"text":"My Fiancee and I love trying new local places for breakfast/brunch every weekend, it's become some what of a ritual for us and something I look forward to during the week. We love supporting local businesses so we were excited to give Oink a shot.  When we arrived at Oink, the Hostess seemed to be a bit flustered and didn't initially greet us and check us in... This was not a bad sign to me, just a new business still trying to work out the qinks.  Once we were seated, the menu looked great. I decided to go for my breakfast favorite, Eggs Benedict (listed as a 'specialty item' on their menu). My Fiancee ordered the French toast and we also ordered a side of bisquits & gravy and sausage. What a DISPAPPOINTMENT! You would think with a name like 'Oink' you would be getting the best breakfast meats one could imagine, this was not the case. The ham on my Eggs Benedict was as thin as a piece of pepporoni (no joke!), our side of breakfast links looked like they were microwaved and tasted like it too. The Eggs Benedict was by far the most disgusting dish I think I have ever ordered, when it first came out, the eggs were clearly over done- more like hard boiled then poached.  However, what made the dish disgusting was the 'hollandaise sauce', it was not hollandaise sauce. It was the color of milk and had the constinancy of half and half and there was so much on my plate that it became Eggs Benedict cereal, literally. The english muffins were soaking in this thin liquid that gave off the smell of yogurt, eww. Even though it looked appalling, I decided to try it. Just to give you an idea, I had to plug my nose in order to chew and swallow it! It was AWFUL. My Fiancee's french toast was good and so was the coffee but thats it. The bisquits and gravy weren't anything special and I was only happy we ordered it because of how completely inedible the Eggs Benedict were. Long story short, if Oink plans on succeeding, they need Gordon Ramsey to come in and help them out. Sorry Oink, I really did want to love you :(  I will NOT be visiting again."}
{"text":"Food was decent enough. I appreciate that they offer corn tortillas instead of toast. However, the restaurant was freezing, and thus I have to give it four stars."}
{"text":"So I thought they were open to 3. I walk in at 1:45 to learn they close at 2. So, I placed a to go order and sat at the front to wait. While I'm waiting the staff is sitting around the front service area complaining about customers that walk in close to closing. Forgive, but a customer who is spending money is the same at an hour to closing as they are at 15 minutes to closing. My last visit"}
{"text":"Had the two egg breakfast with sugar cured bacon.  The breakfast was pretty good except for the bacon!  The hash browns actually had flavor and the eggs were cooked perfectly.  The sour dough toast was good too and not hard as a brick! The bacon was rubbery and limp, didn't even eat it.  Also ordered the \"flight of bacon\" which is one slice of each of the 8 flavors of bacon that they offer. Cost is $10.99 which was a waste of money.  Only 1 piece was thoroughly cooked (the jalapeno), the others were rubbery and undercooked.  Was very disappointed.  I mentioned it to the waitress and she offered to get another one, declined.  She said we should of asked for crispy bacon, that this is the way the bacon is always cooked.....hmmmmm.  Cost of entire meal was kinda high $50+ for 3 people (also we ordered the $10.99 \"flight of bacon\"), maybe go back for a special occasion.  Will go back, just won't have any bacon."}
{"text":"So delicious!!!  The bloody Mary's were perfection along with our breakfast. Recommend the jalapeño bacon . Only wish we had this chain in Cali :)"}
{"text":"Seriously...it's called Oinks but where is the bacon? I ordered an omlet with bacon in it...should have been fabulous with big chunky pieces of GOOD bacon. What did I receive? An ok nothing special omlet I could have gotten anywhere. My husband's omlet was the same. He ordered the one with the shredded meat on it.... can't even recall what it was....but it not anything even worth remembering. Let me say, the concept of Oinks seems good as does the decor and such, but come on, there should be more bacon choices in the menu (options with bacon in them) and when a dish states there is bacon in it, it should be awesome, chunky, full of flavor bacon - nothing like we experienced. Sorry guys.....unimpressed.....you need to live up to your name."}
{"text":"In true Reese fashion I showed up late to the breakfast club shindig. But the server only let me sit there about 12 minutes before asking me if I'd like anything to drink. \"Yes please, water. Thank you. Oh, and may I have a menu please?\" IMO I shouldn't have to ask for that. She should have brought it over when she realized I was new to the table. Whatever. I wasn't really, REALLY hungry yet anyway.   I looked over the menu and by the time she delivered my water I had already decided on the eggs plate with jalapeño bacon. The food was pretty bland. I doused it in pepper and chollula and a bit of salt. Also, if your gimmick is bacon, you had better be damn good at it! The jalapeño bacon was definitely nothing to write home about and a friend who had ordered the bacon flight was only moderately impressed. Definitely not worth the cost in this case. Oh well. What are ya gonna do? Oh I know. Not order that again. The French toast looked yummy and if I lived on this side of town I might bring my sonny man back for breakfast.   In conclusion I feel the entire experience was simply mediocre."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to stop in to Oink Cafe for sometime now and I am happy to say it was just as i expected. The Bacon flight was delicious and juicy! I oredered the biscuits and gravy along with the flight for a amazing breakfast the portions are exceptionally big and come with plenty of food! i will of course come back! I had the pleasure of meeting the owner who checked on me a couple of times to ask what i thought of the food. Great staff all around wish only the best for the busnies."}
{"text":"There aren't a ton of non-chain breakfast places in that area, so this fits the bill if you're looking for a standard breakfast/brunch. The restaurant is a lot larger than it appears from the outside, and there entrance is actually on the backside of the building. The bacon flight wasn't as awesome as we were hoping for, but overall, a decent option if you're in the neighborhood and sick of Chompie's."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Order the flight of bacon. It's outstanding. Also the Arizona omelet is great. They actually have tasty hash browns too. It was quick and delicious. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  We had waited 45 minutes and still didn't have our food. The table next to us came in 20 minutes after us, ate their food, and left.  At one point the server brought us our drinks and said \"let me go put down my tray and I will come right back to take your order\".  It took her 15 minutes to put down her tray.  She also said \"sorry your food isn't up yet, we had a large table ahead of yours\", she was saying this as another table next to us, who had ordered after us was receiving their food.  I am sure she took our order and had to \"put down her tray\" before she sent the order to the kitchen.  We left without eating."}
{"text":"A Café devoted to Bacon? Count me in!   Paid Oink a visit for the last Breakfast Club UYE of 2013. Fantastic turnout, too. Shout out to Monica O. for running this like it's her job, oh yeah!   Ordered the two eggs, scrambled, with hashbrowns, toast, and jalapeño and applewood smoked bacon.   The eggs were cooked nicely; however, the hash browns were lacking in flavor. While the bacon was tasty, I wasn't impressed. It was overcooked. There is such a thing as too much crunch to the bacon.   Cheryl B. let me try one of her maple bacon donut holes . . . So good! Had to restrain myself from buying a box to take home.  I would definitely make the drive from Chandler to give Oink another try . .  Especially for that FULL bacon flight!"}
{"text":"Nice alternative to the typical IHOP places. Good food and neat concept, and our waitress was a blast! Liked it so much we bought a mug!"}
{"text":"The bacon is phenomenal! It was literally the best bacon I've ever had. I also ordered a Belgian waffle, which was fluffy and flavorful. I think they sprinkle pumpkin pie spices on top as well. Everything was really good but I can't get over how amazing the Apple smoked bacon was."}
{"text":"I work a few doors down and have been waiting for them to open for months! Today was my first visit and I wasn't disappointed!  The owner and servers were friendly and the food was fantastic! I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Took the server 7 mins to come over just for our drink order. But the food was fast, menu looked appealing overall. I had the french toast (original) which was good. Nothing special. My partner had the country fried steak which appeared to have canned gravy. Still tasted fine, nothing special. I would probably return, but only if I lived nearby. Which I don't."}
{"text":"Very good! We live nearby. We got the pork confit Benedict and the strawberry cheesecake pancakes. They were delicious. I was worried the strawberry sauce would be goopy red sugar syrup like from IHOP but it was fresh puréed ."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The service today was awesome. I had pancakes and it was so yummy plus the flight of bacon- the jalapeño bacon is my favorite! My boyfriend had the California chicken sandwich which the waitress said to try it in a burrito instead of the bun, and that just made it so delicious!"}
{"text":"We were here for brunch with a large group. The staff did a great job of accommodating us and once we ordered keeping everything straight. I had the 50/50 burger, which was really tasty. The Cole slaw side was a bit sparse. My husband had a traditional Eggs Benedict, which he raved about. And for him, hash browns is the best indicator of a great breakfast, and these were great. The rest of the group seemed to enjoy their meals as well, although there was some question about whether the different bacons really tasted different."}
{"text":"This place is always crowded, so there is a wait but the food is worth it. The portions are big and the service is great."}
{"text":"Oink is pretty much a standard Food Service breakfast spot. The butter comes in individual plastic cups so you need to work at it to butter your pancakes. Nothing special on the pancakes, standard batter.  The juices comes out of a Food Service dispenser which is prominently displayed behind the counter. My food was tepid and the Food Service Hash Browns were not crisped very well. Service was ok, bacon was tasty but cold. For the money, I will dine at a Mom and Pop spot instead that cares a bit more about quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Potential there but this place needs a tune up.  Service is sub par. Slow to get meals and disinterested in giving good service. The amount of dust on the ceiling vents is a bit disgusting. Maple bacon donuts were dry. Probably not coming back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. And if you like bacon...they have 8...yes 8 flavors!  You can get a flight and try them all! Everything was very fresh and served timely and correctly. Also, the cinnamon roll with bacon on top ( check the display of baked goods)"}
{"text":"Liked the food, but the service was a bit slow for our party of 7.  As someone who has worked as a breakfast food server, I know that the morning meal is fast paced and it may take The Oink a little time to get things in sync.  I definitely like the bacon concept and will try this place again.  You can read my full review here:   http://touristoflife.me/2012/03/25/the-oink-cafe-brkfst-lunch-bacon/"}
{"text":"This is a great little breakfast and lunch place with a serious pork fat problem. Think bacon in flavors you may not have thought of. Had a bacon eggs benedict that was really great!. our group also had an amazing pumpkin spice pancake and the florentine omelet. All were very very good. If you like bacon try a bacon flight. 6 pieces each with a different flavor!! This place gets busy so expect a short wait but its is zoo worth it. Here is a tip. They have opened one of these in Tucson and are planning to open in Tempe soon. Do go here!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch, ordered the Chimi. So good!!   Would I come back? YES!  Food: 4  Service: 5+ (wonderful waitress)  I ordered the CHIMI,if you come here you must order. Sooo friggen good and HUGE.   The bacon donut was the SHIT. They warm it up for you!   Other food was okay: - bacon tasting, they all tasted the same  - southwest omelette was good - chicken fried steak was a little chewy"}
{"text":"We went right after they opened which probably was a mistake. Our waitress explained that some of the staff had not shown up for work so it mostly family members working that day. It took a long time to get our food other tables that were seated after us got there food before we did. When the food arrived it was not very bland and tasted a little strange. I really want this place to succeed, so I will try it again once the grease has built up on the grill."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time at the oink café.  Amazing food and had the best waitress named Emma.  She was so on top of everything, got our food to us fast, and had an amazing personality that brightened my day.  We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Tried this place for breakfast a few weeks ago on a Saturday. Extremely long wait for food. 1 hour to be exact. 3 men came in and sat down beside us and it was obvious one of them had the hots for the waitress. They both flirted back and forth the entire time.  Amazingly they got their food in 10 minutes. After  I saw that I spoke up and asked \"what's is going on here\"? she said she they must know someone in the kitchen, haha. Needless to say that's all we needed to hear. Ba bye Oink, we won't be seeing you again."}
{"text":"So delicious and located right next to paradise valley mall. It was pretty busy for a week day but still only like five min wait. Maple bacon donuts were awesome"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places near my work. I go here for my work meetings, and love it. Food is great, staff is great, and the location is great. I can't wait for them to open one in south chandler near my house, I ask each time I go in so far no go! But love it and recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Service was slooooow, but the food was decent. Not a great first impression, but I am all about second chances. Will try it again."}
{"text":"It's a 4 star based solely on the name and the bacon flight!  The jalapeño bacon was out of this world but that being said everything else was lackluster. Their famous sauce was just a red Chile base that was thick and didn't feel right slopped on top of the omelette I had but the pork was killer and their bacon donut was tasty."}
{"text":"Was enticed firstly by the name, due to the fact that I am a huge fan of bacon (who isn't!)  Looks like they were short a hostess but my server who sat me (Sarah) was incredible! Energetic lady who seemed to had been taking care of most tables in the place and did an awesome job. Very nice, and very fast.  Ordered the paradise valley omelette and was decent, my hash browns were very greasy and the bread not the best quality but still was overall pretty delicious.  The oink Bloody Mary was absolutely delicious, seems like the dollar up-charge from the regular Bloody Mary was a dollar for the bacon, worth it!   The place doesn't seem to have any music playing and the lighting is a little fluorescent, but other than those few things, it's a great cafe!   4/5"}
{"text":"We love Oink. Reminds me of Iowa. I even wore my Iowa shirt today with a pig on it that says \"bacon is our second language.\" Love everything about Oink. Bacon, bacon and more bacon I say! Never had bad service like some of the reviews. Yes it gets busy but that is what happens when a place is popular. Eggs Benedict is the best!! I wish I lived closer so I could eat here every weekend! My review is 5 strips if bacon...or stars if you must."}
{"text":"Great spot lovely staff and the food was delicous overall nice experience would definetly go back"}
{"text":"Got a flight of bacon and a cheeseburger. 8 different types of bacon ranging from spicy to sweet, burger was big and juicy. I went with two kids and they ate all of their food which is always a challenge!"}
{"text":"Oink definitely has a good thing going. The service is great and so is the food. Sometimes there is a little bit of a wait but trust me it's well worth waiting. Everything I have had there is good. And one of the best things to order is a bacon flight especially if it's your first time in. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place has been wonderful for the many years I've been coming here. Great breakfast, unparalleled bacon and the best mac and cheese ever. Today however, I feel empty inside as I sit here waiting for a 50/50 burger... They were out of noodles... I shouldn't be as upset as I am, but I am. I have been craving that delectable plate of oozey mac and cheese for a couple days now. I won't rant, I'll just leave you with this.... If their mac and cheese  (with the jalapeños and jalapeño bacon.) can devastate me so much, you should probably give it a try and see why.."}
{"text":"Flight of Bacon. Bomb! When in Rome...Loved trying different flavors and such a cool presentation! Other menu selections: Mac and Cheese w applewood bacon (normally jalapeño bacon is served in it but somebody does not like spicy...yet. ) I had a few bites thought way too heavy. 50/50 burger w fries. Nothing special there. Dry and flavorless :( I did Pork Confit Benny and it was okay. Kiddo said my pulled pork is way better at home :) but still enjoyed eating it. Home fries were cooked nice and I liked peppers and onions in it. Don't live in the area so doubtful we would make a special trip back here."}
{"text":"The best place for Breakfast and Bacon in the valley! Portions are generous and filling. Never had a bad experience, staff will recognize you and acknowledge you even if you don't sit in their section. Love this place! Definitely a must visit restaurant!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Long wait but was worth it.We grabbed drinks & bacon doughnut holes from the coffee bar while waiting. Love their vanilla lattes, amazing omelets, and you have not lived until you've had a flight of bacon."}
{"text":"The food is awesome. The bacon flight is amazing.  But our server was literally the most miserable and inattentive woman. She spoke very condescending when speaking to me and we saw the rest of the staff more than we ever saw her. She rolled her eyes when I informed her that she over charged me on orange juice but no wonder she was confused! She never came to the table! She had short black hair, glasses and a Green Bay Packer jeweled shirt on. If you want to enjoy your amazing meal at Oink, specifically ask to avoid her section because she absolutely didn't deserve the 20% tip I left her out of courtesy because she basically made us feel like our table was a burden to her. I wish I could have tipped the nice girl who got us OJ refills and filled our waters instead. I would have rated 5 stars if she wasn't so unpleasant to deal with."}
{"text":"We celebrated my birthday at Oink Cafe today.  Our first time so we shared the flight of  bacon which was enjoyable.  I ordered the blueberry pancakes which were plentiful and juicy.  Quality of tuna in daughter's sandwich was high.  Mimosa was ok but not something I would want to repeat.  Biggest challenge is that I am a short person and the tables are too high.  As a result I had some major spillage on my clothing.  After brunch we had to run to Ross and purchase a replacement blouse so I could continue my Bday activities."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today after living right around the corner for months. I had the pork benedict with home fries and a side of bacon while my friend got the denver omelette. The pork was dry, I was given the wrong kind of bacon. His omelette was ok but the biscuit on the side was so stale we joked about throwing it against a wall. I really don't understand how this place has 3.5 stars. Giving it 2 because the bloody Mary's were decent minus the entire stalk of celery taking up space where more vodka could be. The home fries were awesome. Service was friendly. Won't be going back - not nearly worth a $43 breakfast for two."}
{"text":"First off I'm trying to be more adventurous with my food choices and was in the area and decided to come here for lunch with my babe..she wasn't so sure about it as she's not big on meat and bacon to be exact   Came during the last hour that they were open and the place was still packed and very busy. If I hadn't notice the sign that said it closes at 2 pm, I wouldn't have known that this place could be cleared out in an hour!! Anyways, decided to see how long the wait would be and was seated immediately.   The waitress came over shortly after being seated and took our order. The wait between ordering and our food coming out was close to 20 minutes! I guess not too bad, but we noticed that people that came in after us were getting their orders much sooner then us. Maybe it was because of my order. Anyways, food finally came out and was much larger in size then I had expected. Babe didn't enjoy her food, even though it was just a turkey sandwich. She said it was very plain and had no flavor to it. I on the other hand ordered the Ranchero Chimichanga which was delicious. It was VERY filling tho and felt like I overate when I was done. I didn't even get around to eating my side of fries (came with the order).   This place is very popular and tables were always filling up as soon as someone left. Good thing the tables were cleaned immediately and floors swept as soon as someone left. Our waitress seemed to have half the tables, so she didn't come around to us but one time. Was very friendly though.   May try this place out again if in the area and hungry."}
{"text":"We have been here a handful of times, but I have never taken the time time to write a review until today. We went out to celebrate Father's Day a little early since we won't be in town for the next few weekends. Anyway, we happen to mention it just in conversation and the next thing we know, our waitress brought over some complimentary bacon donuts. Then the manager stopped by to welcome us and just say hello and happy Father's Day! I have to say the service today was phenomenal. We felt so special and just loved being there today. The food has always been good, but the service today is what will make us go back sooner rather than later!!! Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot with lots to choose from.  Server was very nice and the food was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"I tried, oink cafe, I tried. I came and ate your food a number of times. I had your coffee. I had your juice. But no matter what I had it made no use.  It seems your staff would be somewhere else. It seems you buy the cheese that comes pre-melt. I want to love you and to tip you well. Because you're right there and you could be so swell.  But I work hard for the little money I make. At a restaurant in fact so I know what's at stake. It's not with pride that I make this 2 star review. It's in hope that the truth will motivate you.  But for real, I've come in here like 6 times over the course of 8 weeks. The food is mediocre, edible greasy spoon stuff but that doesn't match the scenery. Though the staff is nice enough, I had the (mis)pleasure of sitting at the \"bar\" which apparently is where the staff goes to do their b****ing and I was thoroughly disappointed, particularly by the older one with silver hair - she doesn't seem like she has one sympathetic molecule in her body. All face value nothing genuine there at all. Anyway, I can handle all that I work at a bar and restaurant I know how it goes. But the final straw was waiting a longer than it took to cook and eat my food for me to receive my check. Quite actually, 21 minutes. And it wasn't even my server who noticed."}
{"text":"Pretty standard fare for breakfast; good pancakes and bacon but the service needs a serious kick in the pants. Half empty, 4 servers and the server that seated us couldn't remember that she seated us and needed to wait on us. Food took forever, bill took forever."}
{"text":"How can you not want to eat here?! The sign says \"Breakfast, Lunch, Bacon\"!!!  I had a chorizo and egg burrito that was really tasty.  I also had a maple bacon donut that very nearly put me in a (delicious and satisfactory) sugar coma!  The patio was wonderful, the service punctual, and the company was the best!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"First time there.  I came at the end of their day, so it wasn't crowded.  Ordered the Pork Confit Omelette.  It was tasty and a LOT of food.  I love bacon but wasn't in the mood to try the flight today.  Next time!  I had a biscuit with my lunch -- it was quite tasty, as were the homefries.  A great place for breakfast."}
{"text":"We visited on a Monday at lunch. There were plenty of tables and service was fine; we requested to get our ticket right after our food was delivered, and we were obliged.  The infamous bacon flight is impressive, though expensive. It IS very high quality bacon--much better than what I usually get at the grocery store. The taste differences are quite noticeable.   I had the strawberry chicken salad. It was the full size, and it wasn't huge.Okay, I knew this was a place known for breakfast food and bacon, and yeah, the salad was just okay. The chicken didn't have a lot of flavor and had obviously just been pulled from the fridge. It wasn't bad by any means.  My husband had four pancakes. He's a guy with a big appetite, and he was defeated by these pancakes. They took up a whole platter. The sample I had was light, fluffy, and everything a pancake should be.   Oink Cafe definitely knows their breakfast stuff. It's pretty far from us, but I'd be okay with visiting again if we were in the area."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place. Very relaxed and the food was decent. They have an interesting take on breakfast focusing on bacon this and bacon that.   The food was about average I had biscuits and gravy, the coffee was good. To be honest it was a little in the pricy side for breakfast but the portions were large.   It's worth checking out, maybe a more bacon centric dish will rock your world.  I would have been happier with a smaller more flavorful breakfast for the price. ~personal preference~"}
{"text":"I had the best Eggs Benedict ever!!  Their hollandaise sauce was unbelievable.  Our server, I believe her name was Natalie was fantastic. She put up with the antics of my friend.  Our food came out within minutes of ordering, and it is a great little neighborhood find!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Our breakfasts at The Oink Café (Paradise Valley) were delicious and accompanied by super tasty bacon and sausage sides. I wanted to sample a variety of their bacons, so I ordered a basic breakfast of two eggs with hash browns, then added a half-flight (4 pieces) of bacon, and 2 sausage links.  I was in Heaven! My wife ordered the Oink French Toast Combo with a sweet crumb crust topped with whipped cream and strawberry sauce, berries and sugar, plus an egg with bacon. She savored every bite!  They also serve espresso drinks, premium beer, and cocktails - especially Bloody Marys. Everything is fresh and service is very good.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"It was super busy when we got there, but we were seated quickly and the service was pretty good. Granted, we went on a Sunday morning, so I shouldn't have been surprised at how busy it was. The food was great and the poinsettia (drink) was awesome. Overall, it was a good experience and I would definitely go back there in the future."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like bacon? Been coming here for almost two years now and it's fairly consistent. The bacon is ok, but nothing that has me doing backflips. Service is usually very good, as we've learned to request Autumn if she's working. The restaurant is very clean and the food is good during off-peak times. When it's busy, forget it... break out the dice, because it's hit and miss when it comes to quality. Neat niche though."}
{"text":"Favorite place for breakfast on the weekends for my husband and I! I always get the chorizo skillet with home fries and he gets the eggs benedict with hashbrowns. It's all so so good and the service is great every time too!  Can get kinda pricey (we usually drop close to $40 for us two) but so worth it!"}
{"text":"Here is my pigtail.   When I can, I will stop in a new restaurant, meet and greet the owners and look over the menu to see something traditional and something new. What catches my eye here is the bacon. You know bacon will never let you down.  I learn from the owner that he hires the chef, over several qualifications but will have to cook one meal to get the job. So I decide to order the job winning meal.   I was really not all that interested in testing chef's speed, artistry and creativity, nope I want a winter savory meal representing his interpretation of the classic Eggs Benedict $9, and a side of jalapeño bacon $3.   Everybody enjoys a surprise ingredient and the jalapeño heat in the bacon was a winner. The flavor of the Hollandaise sauce was rich and buttery with that ever so slight lemon tang. The perfect poached egg too.  Lunch the next day I had a club sandwich. A excellent sandwich born from the remnants of many delicious things. Three slices of thin white toast, choice of bacon and I chose honey bacon since I already enjoyed jalapeño bacon the previous day. Lettuce, tomato, honey cured ham, turkey and a little mayo and spices. There are three choices of fries, regular, thick and sweet. This meal is very large. $8. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gugN1sgyheBJ6aKtNcv_gQ?selected=UAcma3FjSfkUnnRZkvLGyA  One last note, the meats are oven cooked in this kitchen, roast beef next up. The staff and the owners are kind and thoughtful. There are plenty of pros to dining here and I have yet to see a con."}
{"text":"Good Food ...Big Portions ...Bacon choices   But .... The employees were sitting at the bar area ,  talking loudly the entire time we we're attempting to enjoy our breakfast ... Annoying and unprofessional ... A high school atomsphere that really made for a bad experience ...suggestion take all that horsing around and chatter to the break room ..."}
{"text":"Been driving by this place for years and finally decided to try it out! My advise is: go, Go GO! This place was great! Bacon EVERYTHING! YUMMY! Don't walk, RUN NOW! Amazing place. Now i can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"We have since been back a couple more times.  They've got it together now. Solid breakfast spot...  Good service, good food, good prices."}
{"text":"This place was super busy! That's always a good sign! The Barista I think her name was Rachel offered to seat us at the outside bar. There were people there but just waiting for tables, she was super polite and made great recommendations as it was our first Oink experience. She was great a multitasking the phones and remained super attentive.   The eggs were delicious and the bacon was seriously amazing. I had honey cured and jalapeño, both were cooked perfectly.   Overall we will be back, super friendly wait staff, delicious food!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  And being kid friendly is a huge plus for us.  We have had the pleasure of eating here several times and have never been disappointed.  Wait staff has always been friendly and pleasant.  We do not  mind waiting on average 20-30 minutes.  It is worth it.  Love this neighborhood cafe."}
{"text":"Pretty weak, it's a Dennys disguised as some sort of niche bacon place"}
{"text":"Positives first: my bloody Mary was really good. My boyfriend and I both thought our breakfasts were good. Sad realities: this place is always so crowded. I went twice and left after being told there was a 45 minute wait for a table. On the third time, we had a 20 minute wait. But once we were seated, our waitress was so busy and overloaded that it took 15 minutes to get our WATER. As a former waitress, I know I'm not being unreasonable in saying that THAT is UNREASONABLE. And then we ordered 2 different side orders of bacon (jalapeño and honey-cured), thinking that a place that supposedly specializes in bacon would have mind-blowing bacon. No. It was normal bacon. Our lives were not changed. It's a cute place but I would not recommend it to anyone unless I knew they had NO other plans for the day, because they would have to spend most of their morning sitting and waiting for average bacon."}
{"text":"Average.  I had the Arizona omelette and it was smothered a little too much, couldn't even taste the omelette.   The potatoes tasted like something you could buy at a hospital cafeteria.  The coffee was hot and decent.   There is nothing special about this place and would rather have home-cooked  and tasty, unique food than a bright atmosphere with a trendy name."}
{"text":"They told us it would be a 20 minute wait. We waited 40 minutes. We ordered premium coffees and they were cold."}
{"text":"I've eaten breakfast at Oink several times and had a great meal and comfortable experience every time.  I love eggs benedict and their menu contains several versions of it. The maple-bacon donut is fantastic, too, but this place obviously isn't much for vege choices. Other than that, I like this restaurant for the diversity of customers it attracts from the local area. I think my only complaint is that each dish on their menu seems overpriced by a dollar or two, considering the average sized portions they serve. Overall this is a casual, top-notch place for breakfast but a little pricey compared to, say, the I-HOP right across the street."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place and overall enjoyed the experience. We went on a Sunday morning and it was busy. Good sign and even better, it didn't effect our brunch.  Our party of  6 was seated almost immediately. We had two young kids so it was great that we were.  Our server was helpful despite the rush and our food arrived   quickly.   Now the menu lived up to its namesake. Bacon was omnipresent! Bacon scones, bacon pancakes, a bacon sampler to name a few. The bacon items were great yet outside of them the rest of the food was rather ordinary, typical breakfast fare.  It was good yet nothing different if it wasn't bacon centered.  All in all good time and would come back to enjoy the bacon goodies. Maybe the rest of the menu will catch up with its star."}
{"text":"ONE star for cold breakfast food that has the potential to be much better.   The two of us took the open seats at the bar counter because the wait time for other tables was a usual 20 minutes (no, not long but we were on a schedule today so we needed to get in and out fairly quickly). As other reviewers recently posted, I'm not sure why there was much of a wait at all since there were 6 others tables open to seat customers. Strange.   We waited over 30 minutes for our food to come out only to be significantly disappointed by what we bit into. Neither of our Benedicts were even lukewarm and the bacon that is \"raved\" about was certainly nothing special. If you are going to feature a specialty item such as a bacon tasting board it better be something memorable! This was anything but that- very lightly flavored and pretty thin. We both said to each other that our food would have been great if it were hot. It's a shame- these foodies won't be back and certainly won't recommend Oink.   Ours weren't the only gripes- we overheard the staff quietly noting how many complaints there were today. I just don't get it. Breakfast is the easiest meal to cook. Management needs to get this place together!!!  Also was quite turned off by one of the back-of-the-house fellas that frequented the front bar area with a cigarette hanging behind the ear- SOO unappealing. What if that fell in someone's food!?!!  Noting that although we had an unfortunate experience, we appreciated that management took our concerns seriously. Thank you for that."}
{"text":"Took 3 kids for breakfast, 2 boys had pigs in a blanket. Pancakes fine but sausage was soaked in grease. Nice location, Nice servers, not impressed with food. Only open for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Ordered Ham steak and eggs for $8.99. If the ham was shoe leather it would'nt be enough leather to resole my 18mo grandsons shoe. $3.99 for one dinky biscuit with gravy (which was horrible) come on. hash browns were cold and flavorless. service was so-so. You need to get it together. there are better breakfast restaurants out there competing for your dollar. I  would not go out of my way to return"}
{"text":"Died. and. gone. to. heaven.  Bacon sampler, sublime. The only way this place could possibly be better is if you could buy their bacon by the pound and bring it home to cook. Because I would live on a steady diet of their honey bacon.   They have a lot of other delicious food, too. But I don't care. Because flights of bacon. OMG."}
{"text":"This is a great place. Always make sure to bring the family all 26 of us when in town!   They have Great service . All it takes is a call and they can find room! We try to go early because we have such a good time here!  Who Doesn't Love Bacon 7 different kinds! and their  food is wonderfull!!  Fluffy pancakes, Crispy Bacon, Great Eggs Benedict! and I caould go on you just have to try it to believe it.  and did I mention 7 different kinds of bacon love it"}
{"text":"We had wanted to try the Oink Cafe for a long time. Unfortunately, we tried it today.  We went late, our fault, and there was a wait. Only about 20 min and they were accurate in their estimate of the wait. The decor is, I don't know, off. There are large images of pigs on the wall in some places and big expanses of empty wall in others. Oh, and the colors are a little much for a breakfast restaurant.  Initially the service was good, but that deteriorated too.  The worst part was the food. I ordered a build your own omelette and my partner had Ham Steak and eggs with a tortilla. He's on a low carb regimen right now. He enjoyed his, but the presentation was lackluster at best. Two eggs (ordered over medium and cooked over easy) the ham steak and a tortilla all on a white plate. No garnish, just white eggs, a slightly pink piece of ham and a beige totilla on a white plate. Not very appetizing at all! I felt sorry for him.  I ordered an egg white omlette with spinach, tomatoes and cheddar. I would have preferred Feta, but they don't have it on the menu. Mine came with home fries and an English Muffin. Oh, and the omellette I received was regular eggs not egg whites. Yes, I could have said something, but I was starving at that point and just wanted to eat. The weirdest part of the omlette was the cheese on the outside. Who the heck puts cheese on the outside of an omlette?  For $25 bucks for two I would have expected more food and better quality.  After brunch we made a quick stop at Target, but then we had to run home as the meal made me ill.   Sorry Oink, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Fun breakfast place.  The flight of bacon is a great idea - can't have too much bacon.  Service was good on our last visit.  Good selection of breakfast items."}
{"text":"So here is the deal.  I have been to Oink twice before and although I liked it I was not blown away or anything.  I would say it was slightly above average.  But I also knew there was something special about this place.  So recently I went back for the third time and I discovered something great.   So for years now if anyone mentioned chicken fried steak there was only one place that came to mind.  Texaz Grill.  Everyone agrees that they have the best chicken friend steak in town.  Well I am here to tell you,  there is a new player in town.  Oink has amazing, amazing chicken fried steak.  I would have to say that Oink and Texaz Grill are 1 and 1A.  in no particular order.    Also maybe it was because I was enjoying my food so much that the service was also exceptional that day.    I am very much looking forward to my next visit to Oink."}
{"text":"I've had the jalapeno bacon stuffed pancakes, they're to die for every bite is hot and sweet...we've never had a bad meal and always recommend it!"}
{"text":"I went here today to try out the new local breakfast joint and just get something to go. I stood at the to go window for about 15 minutes before having to flag someone down to finally help me. I ordered the Maple bacon donut which they only had one left and it was kinda crumbled so the manager said I could have it for free which i thought was great and super nice of him but the waitress still charged me which, i wasn't going to haggle over it. So in regards to the service the manager was super nice and fantastic. The waitress left a lot to be desired but i won't hold that against the restaurant.   sooo, back to the food. the bacon maple donut is a cake donut with crunchy bacon sprinkled on top all glazed over. I thought it was good but not great. The donut seemed a little over cooked so u didn't get that soft middle but the taste was nice. a nice salty almost toffee like crunch from the bacon with a little bit of sweetness from the maple glaze. I could of used a little bit more sweetness at the tail end though.   I also ordered their bacon flight which comes with 8 different types of bacon including applewood, hone cured, jalapeno, peppered, sugar cured, hickory, apple cider, and pecanwood. The bacon left  a lot to be desired with only the peppered and jalapeno sticking out. Otherwise i wouldn't of been able to tell the others apart. I cleared my pallet after each piece to taste the different notes but they just weren't there. The bacon wasn't bad, don't get me wrong but it tasted like the bacon u would get at waffle house.   Overall I think a 3 out of 5 is pretty accurate. I like what there trying to do and I liked the manager but the execution is not there yet. We don't have many good local restaurants on this side of town so I really hope they can find a winning formula."}
{"text":"I was staying just down the street for a work training and arrived early so I had some time to explore. The woman at the front desk of my hotel said hands down Oink was the place to go if I wanted a good local spot. She was so right! A place with 8 types of bacon on the menu had to be at least okay, right?! The service was good, everyone was very sweet and attentive.  I got the pork confit omelet and it was good. The pork was super tender and really well seasoned. It's a ton of food, omelet toast and a side of your choice. I got the ranchero sauce on the side and I'm glad I did because it was spicy so I don't know I would have wanted it on top of all my omelet. As a sweet treat I got the maple bacon donut, woah baby! It was served nice and warm was cakey and had some nice cinnamon spicing to it, it was a little dry but I was there closer to lunch and I hadn't had a donut in a couple years so I didn't mind.  Overall good breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"I learned last time here that they offer gluten free bread so today assumed they could make GF French toast. But the server, Tami,  informed me they were too busy, since it's a weekend, to make me any. Disappointing. We left another restaurant with a long wait to come here. The other restaurant offers way more GF options. Anyway I ordered the two egg breakfast with hash browns and GF toast. My friend had biscuits and gravy. The order came out within minutes so it's clear they were not made to order. Not on a busy Saturday. I will say that the eggs were good but my hash browns were cold. The server did ask is how everything tastes but it was moments after our food came and we hadn't had time to try anything yet! I think the service is hit or miss. The food is decent. I'll probably come back but honestly a few things could be tweaked."}
{"text":"The food was really good and decently priced..... All the way up until 2 sides of gravy like 1/3 cup each and 1/4 cup hollindaise sauce costed over 10$ alone. Didn't tip much due to that over priced surprise. Was nice for a 1 time thing. But prolly won't come back."}
{"text":"Their healthy omelet is so delicious as well as the oink omelet. We did the flight of bacon which was fun as well. Oatmeal is the best. Staff are fantastic. Great experience."}
{"text":"This was the first place we ate at when we moved to Scottsdale, great food, amazing service, and worth any wait.  My husband is the most impatient person but never minds if we have to wait (its usually 15-20 min as they manage their tables and service well). We truly love coming here and highly recommend - especially if you love bacon."}
{"text":"Wasn't very impressed with the pancake combo bacon was normal, pancakes bland, eggs were like I went to a buffet and had been sitting out for a while. Overall I'd say if you don't have taste buds or your a horrible cook at home then you should go here if you actually like what your eating and appreciate quality food don't bother. I think there's an ihop across the street that could do a much better job than these folks"}
{"text":"The food here is above average & is reasonably priced. The service is is also good, it's good to see the manager so active in helping his staff busy or slow, it shows a well run operation.   The bacon doughnuts & flavored bacons stand out and are delicious.  However, one of their signature dishes, the pork confit, was very dry & bland. Other than that, I have not had a bad meal & have eating breakfast there for about a year.  If you go on a Saturday or Sunday morning, be prepared to wait 45-60 minutes for a table."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts in town. Had the pork confit Benedict and it was perfect. The ambiance is bright and the staff friendly. If you are looking for a treat at moderate price, this is a place for you."}
{"text":"The Oink Cafe, how can you not go here with such a great name.  I ordered a boring breakfast because my stomach was upset. Egg, bacon, French toast and fruit.  It was a busy morning, but we got seated right away.  The manager came by and asked how our food was which was nice.   Can't go wrong with a breakfast cafe, wait yeah you can. But not this one!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Next time I am going for the flight of bacon. Friendly and courteous staff who went out of their way to make me feel comfortable and appreciated."}
{"text":"First let me say this.  They have only been open a few days, and I will give them another try AFTER they get all their kinks worked out.  My fiancé and I went Saturday morning around 10am for breakfast.  First there was no one at the door or a sign that said please wait to be seated or seat your self, so we walked up and found a server and asked.  They just said find an open table, which we did.  After 10 minutes we flagged down a server to get a drink order and then menus.  Drinks took forever.  First they ran out of coffee and then coffee mugs.  We sat and watched many people sit down, wait, and then just walk out because no one even acknowledged them.    We got our ordered placed and then heard from other tables around us that they had been waiting over an hour for their food.  Luckily we weren't in a hurry.  I had the cafe fresh toast and my fiancé had some eggs and bacon with a side of biscuits and gravy.  Their food was VERY good.  I Loved mine!  The biscuits and gravy were the best we have had in Phoenix (I'm not too sure if that is saying all that much though).  The food took about 30 minutes.  We constantly had to ask for coffee refills.  I think the servers were doing their best.    Either they were not prepared for a busy morning or they really had no clue what they were doing in the back of the house or front for that matter.  I hope they can pull it together because the food was very good.  Like I said I will go back for another try and re-rate they in a month or two.  I would recommend it to others as long as they know going in that it might be a Cluster."}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere but the food was very average. I got the donut for dessert but it was really dry, and more like a coffee cake."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I recommend the Oink Bloody Mary if you like bacon in your Bloody Mary. However, the Oink omelette is a pork overload that any pork lover can handle.  One of my favorite places to eat breakfast since moving to Phoenix, Az."}
{"text":"This place is a decent breakfast joint, but the only thing that really makes it stand out are the bacon flights, as the rest of the menu covers the basics you can find just about anywhere else. With that said the apple cider bacon is soooooo so good!  My visit was a combination of decent food and spotty service which amounted to quite the average meal. My dad and I came in for lunch during the week and waited a few minutes to be seated, which is no big deal. However once we were seated we waited, and waited, and waited until my dad finally got a servers attention and asked if we could place our order. I think there was some confusion around who was supposed to take our table, but the waitress helped us. She was nice but definitely a little busy with all of her tables. We asked for two waters, and only got one, then asked for the second and still had to flag someone else down to finally get it. After our food arrived it took awhile to get our bill too. Again, it just seemed like maybe a lack of clear coordination among the entire floor as our waitress was nice herself.   For the food, I got the California omelette with a side of fruit and toast and my dad got a bacon flight and eggs. The omelette was a good size and filling, but there wasn't really anything that stood out about my meal. The bacon flight was of course cool and my dad enjoyed the selection but that was about the only highlight of the meal.   Again, you can get a filling breakfast and try out some different kinds of bacon, but unfortunately overall nothing about this place is really calling me back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! The jalapeño bacon and apple cider bacon were my favorites.   Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 times. The food is always good. The service is good. The bacon flight is really tasty. I like the jalapeno bacon the most."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast with friends and was not overly impressed with the food. Two tiny pieces of bacon with \"home fries\" that appeared to come from frozen. There are far better choices close by. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Of course, every parent thinks their child is the cutest, smartest, best behaved and many other superlatives.  When we find a restaurant that shares our opinion of our just-turned 2 year old son, well, all the better.  If I could give them 10 stars for service, I definitely would.  We arrived at 10AM to meet our friends for Sunday brunch.  The restaurant was crowded and I was expecting a long wait for a table for 6 adults and the aforementioned toddler.  However, our wait was less than 5 minutes.  Our friends had been there before and ordered 2 flights of bacon for the table to share.  Most of the 8 varieties were good, some were OK and some were outstanding (it's bacon after all, even when it's meh, it's still pretty good).  My favorites were the jalapeno and the pecan wood.  My least favorite was the apple cider, I felt the cider just didn't add anything to the flavor experience.  I ordered the Paradise Valley omelette with fruit and an english muffin.  I thought it was a very nice extra that you got so many choices for sides with the omelettes.  The PV option comes with bacon, mushrooms, spinach and cheese.  The omelette was one of the best I have had in years.  There were two reasons for this.  First, the mushrooms and spinach, both vegetables with high water content, had been properly cooked so they didn't drown the eggs.  Secondly, the ingredients were very evenly dispersed so with each bite, I got the full combination of all the add-ins.  Here's where Oink Cafe went above and beyond, IMHO.  We had visits from a manager and a lady who I assumed was the owner.  The male manager interacted with our son, acknowledging his birthday (our friends had brought him presents) and talking with him and the adults at the table.  The waitress also interacted with our son, refilling his water when he asked for more and treating him like a welcome guest, not some nuisance.  Finally, a lady who I assumed was the manager also stopped by.  She paid special attention to our son, even asking if she could bring him some more fruit when she realized he had eaten all of my side of fruit.  So glad our friends suggested OINK and already looking forward to another visit.  I'll definitely have to take the manager's suggestion of swapping out the regular bacon for the jalapeno bacon on a sandwich."}
{"text":"Found my new breakfast spot when near that area! Customer service was excellent. I had a 2 egg combo with egg whites, fruit, wheat toast and bacon.  Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"We are regulars here. Lana, our server is the best! She is so friendly and knows our order by heart. The owner Donnie walks around to talk to guests and always makes us feel welcome. It's our favorite breakfast place! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was tasty with eggs cooked to order and the hash browns were cooked beautifully with nice not overwhelming flavor of onions.    We also got half a flight of bacon with different flavors.   Honey glazed, applewood smoked apple cider and jalapenos.  I wanted a crisper bacon bite and more flavor.   Especially for a place called oink.    3.5 stars is where this place rates.  We will come back for the breakfast and fun but not for the bacon."}
{"text":"Great service and excellent place to get breakfast. The eggs Benedict were made perfect! You won't be disappointed by their omelettes either"}
{"text":"I suggest you order the Bacon Flight, a sampling of eight varieties of bacon, to accompany whatever else you are ordering. You'll then be on your way to refining your bacon palette. The flight will add about nine bucks to the cost of your meal, but it's a delightful item to share if you are socializing with friends or family. Every visitor to The Oink Café needs to order the flight at least once.  Servers at Oink are very friendly and helpful. They do a nice job of making recommendations and keeping your coffee cup filled. The café itself finds a middle ground, with solid food served at reasonable prices. Not a cheap diner nor a too trendy premium dining spot. The menu is not that innovative, except for a willingness to throw bacon into anything, which is fun. Ordering the eight bacon flight is essential to appreciating the bacon varieties. If nothing else, you'll then know which bacon to request on your next visit. If you don't have this basis for comparison, you'll just think the bacon with your meal is well, bacon. You won't be able to appreciate what differentiates Oink from other breakfast spots.  The restaurant is housed in an odd long and narrow space, but there's a deceptive amount of seating. There can still be a wait, however, at peak times. There is also a small dog friendly patio for outside dining. Oink is kid friendly, with a \"little piggies\" menu and a pig to color while waiting to be served. If you appreciate art, you'll enjoy the large number of the pig masterpieces from previous diners on display."}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was pretty standard. Bacon was awesome!"}
{"text":"Love the premise of the restaurant: Breakfast, Lunch, Bacon.  Service was poor. We were there the week it opened and were told that we could sit but it would be an hour before we got food. We were not able to stay so we left. I appreciate them giving us a head's up. Then we tried again a week or so later and were seated- no warning about the length of time to be served and it was over an hour before we and several tables around us were served. They offered us a free pastry but did not comp anything off of the bill. That was disappointing. Food was ok. Hopefully they will get it together because I would love to make this place a regular stop. I can see them really making something of the theme buy selling bacon themed items like bacon popcorn, bacon band aides, bacon scarves, bacon wallets, bacon lamps, etc...a little bacon shop within the place."}
{"text":"Eh- went there today and stood at the front to be seated for too long with no one acknowledging me! I almost left because no one came, finally someone said she'd be right with me. The customer service was just not there today! Also my French toast combo was a little expensive for not looking like a lot of food!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice. The first time was pretty good, but the second time all of the food at my table was significantly overdone. First time here would have ranked 4 stars, and the second time here ranks 2 stars. I figured I would average it out at 3 stars overall. Not too bad, but consider trying Snooze AM if you are looking for a place to grab brunch."}
{"text":"Three stars because it was average.  I loved the idea of this place, and thought it would be fun to try. Well, it was average.  I got a half flight of bacon (4 pieces - applewood, honey, sugar and apple cider). The only one that tasted any different from its brothers was the apple cider. I'm not sure if I actually liked it or just likes the fact it didn't taste the same.  I got the bacon benedict. It looked good, and the hash towns weren't bad (if very plain). The bacon was very hard, and the sauce was way too thick. It was also honestly kind of tasteless. My mother and daughter both had French toast and enjoyed it, however.  Just for fun we ordered a bacon donut on our way out. Granted I didn't eat it until a few hours after we'd left (kids, whatcha gonna do?), but I didn't find it very good either. Not much taste, very dense."}
{"text":"I would probably only give this place two stars. I came for breakfast with my boyfriend today and neither of us were too impressed.   We started with the flight of bacon. First of all for what you get it's expensive. $8-$9. They all tasted the same except for the peppered bacon somewhat stood out.   I ordered the Arizona omelette because I love chorizo. You literally couldn't even taste or see the chorizo. It seemed like one big blended omelette. Kind of weird. Plus it's SMOTHERED in \"ranchero\" sauce. It's this dark red thick spicy sauce. I would ask for it on the side if you're going to order it.   My boyfriend got the breakfast burger. He didn't seem too thrilled.   To be honest, I know it's the \"oink cafe\" but it was almost pork overload. And I don't really enjoy staring at pictures of cute cartoon pigs all over the walls while I eat bacon. Probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"The Boy and I decided to try The Oink after another breakfast place was closed for the holiday and had a Meh experience.  The food was very good.  I enjoyed my Two Egg Plus combo, it was a large amount of food if you find yourself hungry.  I chose scrambled eggs and they were fluffy and buttery.  I chose a biscuit option instead of toast and it was HUGE.  If you are a biscuit and gravy fan, I would suggest going ala cart from the sides menu (one biscuit vs two) as one biscuit split in half would fill and entire plate.    The boy had Huevos Rancheros and was very happy.  He especially liked the ranchero sauce, I had a taste and likened it more to a mole, super dark yet sweet with a hint of heat.  I also tried their classic bloody mary which had more heat than spice.    Where our experience was lacking was the service.  Our server did not check on us once after we got our food and we had to flag her down to get to go box after she dropped the check and left while I was asking for a box.  My two egg plus combo came with choice of bacon but my server didn't ask what kind I wanted and I forgot it was an option. Seems like this would be front and center for a server since the 8 kinds of bacon are listed all over the menu and walls.  We also weren't given straws for our drinks (including the bloody mary) while all other tables had them in all their drinks. Our drinks were never refilled and one attempt was made to refill my coffee five minutes after I got it.   The hostess and busser staff needs some training.  During our 20 min wait at any given time, there were 4 or 5 tables empty waiting to be seated or waiting to be cleared.  There was a wait-list of 8 parties waiting to be seated during that time with open tables so revenue was being missed with that many open tables.  I also saw hostesses walk by tables full of dirty dishes and not touch a single dish.   I do want to give props to the patrons.  A gentleman was going to eat breakfast alone and was waiting for a table when a table of two asked if he wanted to join them instead of waiting and dining alone.  Awesome."}
{"text":"This place is unique to sum it up in one word. Great, random selection of bacon goodness. I actually prefer this over the larger, chain-type cafes and diners but they're only open til 3 :/. Very good prices, great staff, great selection again, good parking and location."}
{"text":"Tempted to give only 2 stars but the sonoran hot dog I had the first time i stepped foot into Oink saved them.  I have been here twice. First time was was shopping at Target and my wife wanted to stop in and get an iced coffee. Got denied as the espresso machine was already off and cleaned for next days use. Manager gave use a coupon for two free specialty drinks so that was very thoughtful. While checking out the place I noticed a special on the wall and it was a sonoran hot dog. For 6 bucks I got the bacon wrapped dog, side of fries, and roasted jalapeno, Serrano, and onion. Great presentation and excellent taste. This was a 3-4 star visit although not getting what we came in for the sonoran hot dog saved the day.  2nd trip. Went in for breakfast wielding our 2 free specialty drink coupons. Waitress took our drink order (two iced americano's) and they came out hot. No biggie lets order food. Waitress' customer service skills were that of a high school kid at his first job. Lady was very blunt and did not act like she cared. Food came out to order but the frozen hash browns were over cooked and couldn't get a water refill.   Had the maple glazed bacon donut and it was basically a sugar cake glazed in maple with bad n bits on top. nothing special.  3 stars and will try this place again eventually."}
{"text":"I need to come back and try the other menu items.   But come on an 8 piece flight of different bacons. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Loved every minute of being in here! I had a two-hour window between appointments in the area and decided to stop in to kill time. Thankfully, they have wifi!  I told my server upfront that I'd be hanging out for a bit and to keep the coffee coming. She did! With a name that includes \"oink,\" you should already know that this place is centered around bacon. I however, did not partake of the bacon -- not my cup of tea. Yeah, yeah, yeah....I'm THAT girl who walks in and orders a veggie omelet with more veggies on the side. They accomodated me just fine and didn't give me any weird looks for not ordering bacon.  The gals at the table next to me ordered a bacon donut for dessert. So this is an option if your bacon appetizer and bacon entree aren't enough.  Five stahs!"}
{"text":"I went back to Oink this morning since I was in that neighborhood. I must say, it was much better than last time! They have updated the menu and added some new items. I tried the pork confit benedict. It was pretty delish. The pork was falling apart and had delicious flavor, the eggs were cooked perfectly, and the sauce was good too. Definite winning dish. The BF got the bacon pancakes again this time, and he said they were also much better. The batter tasted more homemade versus batter from the box. The prices are still a touch high, in my opinion, but I would definitely go back here because the food was very good. Nice job Oink!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the breakfast.  I'll defintely will be back for the burgers and different bacon flavors. Mmmmmm"}
{"text":"The PV Mall area is in desperate need of a good breakfast joint. You can get Matt's if you go downtown and there are now multiple Over Easy's around the east valley. Unfortunately, this place isn't it. I'm wondering if the 5 star reviews have this place mixed up with another place. Let me first say I think they are trying but if you are bold enough to have a \"Bacon Lovers Entrance\" then you better deliver. Everyone was friendly and we seated promptly. My boy had the kids pigs in a blanket and I had the two egg breakfast.   Before I jump ahead I should back up a bit. Coffee... I love good coffee and for $2.29 I expect some tasty premium coffee. No such luck. Burnt and rather acidic this is the kind of swill you get at Denny's. Am I being too picky if I don't like to have the little Shamrock farms containers on the table?  Fresh cream please. You are competing to be the go to breakfast place for the neighborhood.   Back to the food. My 2 eggs, over medium, were serviceable and prepared as expected.  The hash browns were super salty and even the egg yolk couldn't make them tasty. Not good at all. I had the applewood smoked bacon. I got 2 flimsy pieces that probably were cooked 4 or 5 hours ago and were burnt around the edges. They were also appeared to be about 1/2 the size of a normal piece of bacon. This is a bacon place and you serve this?  My Kirkland Signature precooked bacon at home placed in the oven for 10 minutes is way better. Seriously how can you serve this?  English muffin was OK. Everything probably sat for 5-7 minutes before it got to me. Not cold but not just off the griddle either. My son's \"Pigs in a Blanket\" we're worse. The pancakes were crumbly like a biscuit. They had a strange consistency that really was like a sweet biscuit. The Pigs inside of the blanket were of the Brown N Serve variety or whatever the food supply company sells as a equivalent. Really not good.   How do you call yourself The Oink Cafe and serve these pork abominations?  I know their trying to give you a quality experience but with the pork products they're serving I don't think they are going to be around."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place so bad!  I like the concept behind it, I like the decor, the name and the idea behind the flight of different flavored bacon.  Unfortunately, this establishment fell short of all expectations.   Went in a group of 3 on Sunday for brunch.  2 of us ordered 2 eggs any style + bacon and the third ordered a BLT.  Despite the simplicity of our orders we still had to wait 40-50 minutes for food. That's pretty much where the disappointment begins:  - several tables that were seated after us, got their food before us.  - they forgot to bring my place setting a couple of times - Ordered has browns extra crispy.  They weren't crispy, they were just cold when they arrived =( -they forgot my english muffin -the Jalepeno bacon I was super excited about, tasted like.. regular unflavored bacon.. and it was soggy =/.   For a place named Oink, at the very least you'd expect the bacon to be good right? wrong =/.  I wouldn't come here for food again, but maybe alcohol haha.  Their alcohol is pretty cheap: $4/5 mimosas and bloody maries w/ bacon, $2.50 beer."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times, Food has never been great just good breakfast dining. I do feel that it has dropped a little in quality management as my hash browns were over cooked and the bacon was a little soggy.  Service was fast and friendly and responsive to questions."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch made delicious.  The wait at 11 am on a Sunday morning was long but worth it.  I had the Pork Confit Benedict. The pork was amazingly juicy and flavorful and not at all overpowered by the hollandaise sauce.  My wife had the Oink Omelette which was massive (with 5 eggs) but delicious with bacon, ham, and sausage.  Reasonably priced for the quality and service.  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"This was a great place for breakfast! The bacon was particularly interesting at they had different types and you could get a \"bacon flight\" of all the varieties. French Toast was divine and breakfast in general was good."}
{"text":"I just moved to this area and we tried this place out. Nothing special and I have definitely experienced better.  Service is so so"}
{"text":"Well... with a name like Oink, I expected a cute place full of piggies, bacon infused items, and smokehouse smells.  With fun outdoor windows with cute quotes like... \"warning: bacon smell is imminent\" I hoped for another breakfast joint to add to our local list of favorites like Chez Vous.  Unfortunately, the food did not stand out by any measure.  We sat outside at a wonderful table smelling some scrumptious things from inside.  After looking thoroughly over the menu, we decided we had to try plates with bacon and sausage, signatures off their name, right?  We ordered the Oink Burger - a HUGE sausage patty with hashbrowns and a fried egg on top of a bun - and 2 eggs with hashbrowns, toast, and the applewood bacon.  Now if you're like me, you're envisioning thick, smoked bacon and flavorful sausage.  After waiting for the food to arrive, we held our opinions until after tasting the food.  The bacon had a nice flavor, but was very thin and overcooked.  The Oink burger had the makings of a winner, but the almost 2\" sausage patty had no flavor and so bland I cut it in half to make a thinner patty.  I think the best thing on the plate was the hashbrowns.    Our waitress was very nice even though she had so many tables to serve she was not able to provide refills on our drinks - something we can easily overlook.  I REALLY wanted to love this place... Sadly we didn't find enough amazing differentiators or flavors to drive us back.  I suggest the owners go visit some smokehouses in the south - like Loveless Cafe in Nashville - and bring us some new award worthy dishes!"}
{"text":"Great BLT. So-so, perfunctory service. Hadn't been here before so when I walked in I stood at what I learned is their to-go counter for a good solid 90 seconds before anyone acknowledged me. There were six people behind the counter, & not one gave me eye contact or a simple hello. SIX. Not a good first impression. Once I was told to go ahead & take a seat a young lady dropped off a menu & silverware rollup. She said nothing, did not offer water or tell me my server would be right with me. I realize this is a very casual place but still, when guests are tipping for service it should be welcoming & attentive at the very least.  Food is pretty much what I expected. BLT was great--nice & big, delicious bacon (good thing since this is what they're supposed to be known for!). I added avocado which was fresh and tasty. Fruit salad was the generic pineapple, underripe honeydew, grape combo... but even at The Phoenician the fruit is this way!  Overall, good food, but after tax I wouldn't come & spend $11+ on a BLT (and that's without the avocado). Decent atmosphere, despite the bright yellow & green walls and very harsh fluorescent lighting. Very cute patio."}
{"text":"Our server Jossie helped show us the secrets to getting the most out of our visit at Oink. We loved the bacon, but the service was better! Will definitely be back and bring more friends!"}
{"text":"This is 100% my new breakfast spot for quick and easy breakfast brunch. They serve breakfast all day. Nice atmosphere. Good size patio. Very nice staff and waiters. Whether your coming in for a quick bite or sitting and being served this is a great option."}
{"text":"Friendly, attentive staff. Above average food. Consistent experience. These are the kinds of places we need. I've been here 10 times and look forward to coming here again."}
{"text":"Their devotion to the pork isn't quite what I anticipated, but The Oink Cafe has some pretty solid breakfast food. A group of us went here because my friend CJ said he thought of me every time he passed this restaurant on his way home from work. [For whatever reason, I've become synonymous with pigs and their meat. Go figure.]  I ordered the pancakes with a side of bacon. Both were really good. As a goof, I showed our server my bacon armband tattoo and she immediately brought the owner over to see it. She took a picture of it and our group, then ordered a flight of bacon for us, on the house. I especially like the jalapeño bacon. But, let's face it. Bacon is like sex: even if you don't think you want it, it's still good; you can almost certainly make time for it; and it's best when enjoyed in the company of friends."}
{"text":"Bacon is awesome but place is too crowded and busy. The Omelet is also pretty good. If you look for bacon, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"So we came to this restaurant when it first opened a few years ago.  We were not impressed because they were so unorganized and quite frankly, the food was not that great.  Fast forward to present day and since we were at Target, we thought we would give this place another try and see if it has improved.  So glad we did!!  I LOVE eggs benedict and it's so hard to find a place that serves it just right - where the poached egg is perfectly done so that the yolk explodes into yumminess when you poke into it.  This place has it down to a science.  I have had their eggs benedict every time we have been back (4 times since) and I have yet to be disappointed.  The service is also great!  I do have to say the bacon itself still has much to be desired.  I'm not a huge fan because their bacon is really thin...but the eggs benny?  YUMMM."}
{"text":"Sunday morning around 10am, first time here. I've been meaning to come here for years. It was a full house but we got a booth right away. I ordered the Flight of bacon and Chicken California omelette with English muffin, hash brown potatoes and coffee. Our waitress was friendly and service was very fast. The omelette was very good. The Flight of bacon was 8 strips of all their flavors of bacon. I thought 5 out of the 8 strips of bacon tasted the same. The jalapeño, pepper and pecanwood bacon were distinguishable and tasty. The rest were just bacon flavored to me. It was all good, will have to come back again to sample more of the menu.       Came back a second time for lunch. This time it was about 1:15, they close at 2. The place was half full. I ordered the 50/50 burger with cheese and sweet potato fries. It took little longer for our food this time. The burger and fries were very good.The burger was flavorful and the sweet potato fries were salted just right and crispy. Decent service"}
{"text":"Had lunch with my wife at the Oink Cafe in Paradise Valley. We started with the Flight of Bacon platter, eight different flavors of bacon. For entrees, we had the bacon pancakes and the 50/50 burger, 50% beef / 50% bacon with a side of fries. For dessert, we enjoyed bacon donut holes, pretty much the best baked treat I've ever had! Service was excellent (Thanks, Lana!) and we enjoyed our meal greatly! Also, there is a Half-Price Books right next door, highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Chose this restaurant because I like the name. Service was great but food was just ok. I had the Huevos Ranchero. The red sauce was overwhelming with chili powder flavor and salt. Waffle good. Husbands omelet was greasy and salty."}
{"text":"Poor service and old coffee I asked if they had fresh coffee. Seemed insulted that I asked. Will not return"}
