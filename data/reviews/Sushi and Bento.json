{"text":"I've only ever been here for lunch.  Extremely solid, well-priced dishes.  The interior decor is kind of dinky and small, but the food is excellent.  The chicken teriyaki bento is one of my favourites, beating out many much more expensive bentos I've tried in the area. Service is more than acceptable and the food arrives quickly.  It's a lowkey location that I recommend to everyone in the area who wants a fast, cheap, delicious Japanese lunch."}
{"text":"I'm a S&B regular. Lunch specials are good and lots of variety. I've never had the actual fish as I stick to the vegetarian options and they are good. Would recommend for lunch!  ***UPDATE*** Last week I ordered their vegetarian bento box for takeout... they forgot my miso soup and my tempura sauce. Called in and told the lady and she was very suspicious \"ERM, are you SURE I forgot the stuff?\" Eventually she apologized and I told her I'd be back over in a few minutes. When i arrived she shoved the soup and sauce into my hands and quickly walked to the rear of the restaurant. NO apology, not even a BAG. OK minus 1 point for you, Sushi and Bento.  Today... it happens again. I ask for no dressing on my salad and order the same vegetarian bento box. This time i get the male owner on the phone after calling in regards to my missing tempura sauce. He says \"UMMM OK you come back!\" and hangs up on me. Not to mention, my salad is floating in this vinegar-y \"dressing\". Minus 2 points.  The food is good but service is horrible. I've had little hiccups in my 4 year \"relationship\" with this place but I'm fed up. I will be avoiding S&B from now on and only dealing with their antics when I'm in desperate need of some Japanese. and even then... I will ALWAYS check my order."}
{"text":"I'm sampled several sushi and bento places in the area, and this one stands out as the one with the best bento box. The sushi that I've tried there has been satisfactory too - and at around $8 plus tax for a chicken teriyaki bento box, it doesn't break the bank.  Overall, not mind-blowing but certainly the best option in the area."}
{"text":"Went in on my 30 minute lunch break and was promptly seated. 15 minutes later, I had not received a menu, cutlery, or even asked if I wanted water. They just sat me and ignored me. And it wasn't even busy!!!! Thanks for wasting what little tine I get for lunch!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi spot I have found in the Dundas/University area.  Excellent quality sushi - very fresh!  It is busy during lunchtime, so go earlier or later to avoid the rush.    Portion sizes are good and prices are reasonable. I had sashimi and it was delicious.  Came with a miso soup and salad, both of which were good.  I will definitely be back to have more sushi here at lunch time."}
{"text":"This place was the perfect location for lunch as we walked around downtown Toronto. It was a small \"hole in the wall\" restaurant with a lot of menu options! I'm very particular especially with Asian food places and this one definitely topped my expectations. My family chose from the 'lunch specials' menu and there was a good amount of choices. I am vegetarian so our waitress was able to customize the bibimbap I ordered to have tofu instead of beef. She was very friendly and welcoming and came back twice to ask how I wanted my tofu fried- just to make sure. It came with the bibimbap sauce, which was a spicy chili sauce that was perfect with it! Overall, it was a great place and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I have walked by the Sushi and Bento location numerous times and never stepped in finally to experience lunch the other day.  They have lunch menu with standard sushi and bento box fare.  Most meals are under $10.  The sushi is descent for the neighbourhood.    They do have minimal seats - it is a small seating area.  Service is crazy fast, I finished my lunch less than 45 minutes after ordering!  They do lots of take out orders for customers who live and work in the area.  If you are looking for a quick sushi lunch on King West, Sushi and Bento is your place!"}
{"text":"I was afraid of going into this place because it looked like such a hole in the wall, but the food here is surprisingly tasty and I'll be coming back here again.  The food is decent and I would say better than most cheap sushi joints. There isn't a lot of seating here, but it's not really a busy place where you'd have to reserve seating.  Service here was very slow and the only drawback.  I went here at dinner so there wasn't a busy lunch hour rush and I guess the servers here take their time more.  Definitely coming back here again."}
{"text":"This is our neighbourhood go to sushi place. Their portion is great and they use a lot of fresh veggies and fish and smaller portion of rice, which makes a good proportion for both their sushi and bowl dishes. I always get their haedupbop (Korean style poke bowl with hot and sweet sauce) and my husband loves the fireball sushi roll."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch, food quality is great and the lunch special is well priced. Korean food is also served, which is a nice plus if you like it. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"If you want fast, quality sushi and bento, come here. It's great pricing for the portions and when you walk into this location you're instantly welcomed w nice conversation and huge smiles. They don't have a liquor liscence which is a downfall, sushi  always pairs well w sake or beer but overall is great for a quick hunger fix or sushi craving,"}
{"text":"I'm surprised that most of the reviews are positive. Maybe it's the location, but for the atmosphere and the food it's ridiculously overpriced.  The service is friendly and very quick, that's about the only positive thing I have to say, but for a vegetable bento box it was 12.95, and their teriyaki bentos are about 16, some sushi combos and boxes are even 20, and there the portions are pretty tiny.  Their dynamite rolls are 7.25 in comparison to normally 4.50.. just add a dollar or 3 to every roll and combo and you'll have their prices.   The salads are cheaper though, and the presentation of the food is nice.  Walk 3 doors east and you'll have a reasonably priced sushi place that looks nicer, although I haven't tried the food, it shouldn't be any worse."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 3.5 star!  My stomach is very leery of sushi and sashimi as I very often get cramps if the raw fish is even a tiny bit off.  I find that this happens very regularly after eating at Toronto sushi joints, though not in any of the sushi restaurants I've been to in New York, Hong Kong or anywhere in Japan.  So... no cramps!  Score!  I had a sushi and tempura bento which was quite tasty and had a good quantity of food.  My dining companion particularly enjoyed the tempera yam sticks deep fried enmass into a tangled bundle.  The fish was fairly fresh as declared by my pain-free belly.  The shrimp tempura batter was a bit thick, but tasty.  My friend had the sashimi and tempura bento which was a few dollars more than my box.    Her sashimi was nice and thick.  We came early in the evening so it was pretty empty when we were seated.  It quickly filled up with a lot of singles, so maybe this might be a place to chat up and meet your fellow diners?"}
{"text":"It's a small dinky place on King street, pretty quiet atmosphere. Come here for their lunch special. It's worth it. Bentoes and sushi dishes range from 9-14 dollars from what I remember. sushi is pretty fresh and the rolls are delicious. Warning: they put wasabi in between the sashimi and rice in their sushi pieces so watch out if you're not a fan of the surprise spice.  Service is pretty good. There was just one waitress, and that's all they need really because the place is pretty small. She was pretty attentive. Will come again if i'm in the area."}
{"text":"Ordered take out here because I work in the area. I was kind of skeptical about their quality of food, as the reviews here are very extreme. Anyhow, I decided to give it a try. I ordered their lunch special Sushi & Tempura Bento. It was actually better than what I expected. They were very generous with the portions. Lots of different kinda of tempura, shrimps, cucumber, sweet potato, broccoli, pumpkin, and onions. Their raw fish was pretty fresh as well. Also, their staff are very friendly and cheerful. Almost, forgot to mention they are Korean operated Japanese sushi restaurant. So, you'll also get a taste of korean food as well."}
{"text":"Been hitting Sushi & Bento for years, since it really was a little hole in the wall.  Now that I'm out on the west coast I still find myself in search of spicy veggie ramen as tasty and fulfilling as they make it here.  Would always get some tuna rolls to go too.  Great little place.  Owner takes pride in his business and you can tell."}
{"text":"Red dragon roll was good but don't order the beef tetaki.  Really wanted to satisfy the tetaki craving but was severely disappointed.  Not worth traveling for but if you're in the area and just want sushi/rolls this place is good enough."}
{"text":"I used to work right across the street from this place and I'd head over here whenever I had a hankering for nigiri and miso soup.   The thing that kept me coming back here has to be the service. It's always fast, fast, fast. because it's located in a busy professional area, it gets a lot of customers wanting their food quickly. I would order from my desk and by the time I walked over there it was usually ready. Also, when I would eat in the restaurant, they were very attentive, constantly filling up my tea or water and bring the bill quickly.   The sushi itself was good, but not great. It definitely satisfied my cravings though. I usually ordered a lunch combo that came with miso soup, salad, California rolls and nigiri, which was usually tuna, salmon and shrimp. It was filling and for $9, it was just the right price. The edamame was also very good. My favourite snack to get there is those glass noodles in a vinegar sauce with seeds.   For the price and service, Sushi and Bento is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I dream about the sushi from here! It's fresh, yummy and fast as long as you call ahead and place your lunch order. Consistent time after time and they are alway busy, the tempura is a must try! It's small so get there early if you want to eat in. Staff are friendly and accomidating. Can't wait till I go back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Cute location, great food and incredible service! We tried this place by fluke and were so pleasantly surprised! The staffs attentiveness to all of their customers is amazing! Love love love. This is our new spot!"}
{"text":"Bad service and food. Restaurant looks small and authentic. But food quality is not good."}
{"text":"Small little cozy place with friendly service. Definitely will visit again if in the area."}
{"text":"It is a shame that it is in such a prime area. The rice is too much. The fish is bland and very over priced. Go next door!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favourite sushi places! This is actually the place that adds the least rice in your sushi / maki! I have never been to a place where there is so little rice, just delicious! This is definitely a place to come back again... many times. I strongly recommend their sushi, soups or salads. Loved every bite!"}
{"text":"Lunch special is great deal. The food is good quality. I love how there are many options to choose from. This restaurant has korean and japanese food choices. The customer service was good. The tea is great.  I tried the tempura bento and it was amazing. Definitely worth a shot."}
{"text":"It's not good, its not bad, but it does it's job to satisfy my Japanese food/sushi craving.  Go for the lunch specials which is a bargain when compared to their ala carte prices."}
{"text":"Overall a pretty decent place for sushi. The restaurant is relatively small and does not have a lot of seating so it wouldn't be ideal for big groups but has booths that are perfect for 4. I came on a Friday night so it was likely more busy than usual and thus fairly loud. The food was very good...I ordered spicy sushi and spicy chicken (Korean stir fry). Service was friendly however the restaurant was a bit understaffed."}
{"text":"I really have a love/hate relationship with this place. The love part is with the quality of the fish and the fact that they don't put alot of rice is really important.  Since the first day that I started going there, I always took the #5 Spicy Salmon Roll because it's just that good! My colleagues took other things in the menu and it all looked good. You can also order a beer here and they seem to have a limited selection and they're all foreign brands impressed from Asia.  Now onto the hate part, it takes forever to get our food. I mean when you get there, it will take you like 10 - 15 minutes to order and another 15 - 20 minutes for them to bring the food to your table.   I understand that lunch time is one of their busiest time of the day but in that case they should have more people in the kitchen so that they can get the food ready quicker. There was was a few times in which my colleagues were just so tired of waiting that they decided to leave but like if they heard us, they quickly brought our food. Happens all the time.  Compared to the other sushi restaurents in the area, this place is my little hidden gem. I would definitely recommend that you go check it out but make sure that you order right away so that you get your food as soon as possible."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this little restaurant nestled not far from the corner of King and Bathurst.  Mind you, it's not the best sushi in the Tdot but I always know what to expect.  The restaurant and tables are clean and I've never had to send back a dirty dish.  The staff (wait staff and cook staff) are always very friendly, the food is always fresh and the prices are reasonable.  My personal fav dishes for sharing: Geisha, Rainbow, Dynamite and Sushi Pizza; and I keep the wakame (seaweed salad) and miso soup to myself!"}
{"text":"I got the sashimi lunch (chirashi) to go on Ritual.  I am severely disappointed of the quality and amount of fish they provide. I am comparing this to the other sushi restaurants around the area and the amount I got for $13 is not worth it. They gave me 9 little pieces of fish (look at picture), not only that, I found a nice little pube on one of my pieces (there goes my lunch). The rice was extremely dry and had no seasoning at all. Miso soup tasted like water. Only decent thing was the salad but even that's not enough.   Never coming back even when they give me 20% discount."}
{"text":"Not terrible, but not that great either. I ordered #12 from the lunch menu - sushi & tempura bento ($10.95). The bento box is a pretty large size compared to other bento boxes I've seen. The sushi, although decent, was smaller than most other sushi places I've eaten at. It's nothing to write home about. The shrimp tempura was tasty. The sweet potato in the sweet potato roll was too al-dente for my liking. The miso soup is the same as what you get at other places. The service was good. Although the restaurant is fairly small (about 7 tables of four?), there were seats for everyone who ordered in."}
{"text":"\"Korean and Japanese\" in the restaurant name sounds like \"Palestine and Israeli\", but the food actually reminds of both cultures - and that's impressive. Just try their salad - you will immediately see what I am talking about.  The place is clean, though very small. Service is friendly and lightning-fast. Portion size is normal - not too much, just enough. Quality of food is barely above 3 stars - beef and fish are a bit too hard to chew, but taste really good! Drinks are just not there - even less so because they only carry a fraction of what is listed on the last page of the menu.  Overall feeling is that Sushi and Bento is striving to be at least 3.8, but not yet quite successful in that.  I would not invite there someone who is new to the whole sushi theme, because Sushi Bento will not be the best example - but as for myself, being in the zone, I would not hesitate to come by and maybe take out."}
