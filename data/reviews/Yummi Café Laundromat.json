{"text":"My laundry machine is broken and we desperately needed to do numerous loads of laundry. I went to Yummi Cafe so I could study while doing laundry. The coffee was great and very cheap ($1 for a medium cup size) and there is free wifi.   The place is clean and there are lots of washers and dryers. Various types as well. I was just doing clothes, towels and sheets so I stuck to the regular washing machines but they had more heavy duty machines as well. All of the machines were easy to understand and when I did need clarification (just to double check) the woman working was very helpful.  I did 5 loads of laundry and spent about $15. That is slightly less then I have to pay here at home and the machines are way better then my landlords!   They have snacks and food there too but due to my dietary restrictions I only bought a coffee and brought my own snacks.   I hope my machine is fixed soon but I know where I will go again if need be!"}

{"text":"It's a laundry mat that serves Kawartha ice cream, the best ice cream available in Canada. Made all the more appealing by the fact there is nowhere in the vicinity that sells the ice cream.  In terms of laundry service, I've found the prices to be reasonable and the service to be friendly and prompt. At the end of the day, all laundromat's are a roll of the dice, at least this one offers incredible ice cream!"}
{"text":"Fun and friendly. The girl that was working was cool and helpful. Wifi, coffee and laundry. Work while you work!!"}
