{"text":"Very good food and service. Got the lobster bisque and duck. Both good sized portions."}
{"text":"Best tasting and best looking food in town.  The service and atmosphere are excellent.  I can't remember the last time my wife and I cleaned all our plates during a there course meal.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"The interior of the restaurant is lovely. It was a beautiful Saturday night and the patio was closed. Very disappointing. The service was very good but the menu very limited and no specials available. The food was good but certainly not great. The portions were skimpy and not creative. Generally, stodgy and old fashioned....ridiculously pretentious and not worth the exorbitant prices. They asked on the phone if our dinner was for a special occasion . We told them we were celebrating a birthday and they did not acknowledge it at dinner. With all of the great restaurants in Cleveland we would NEVER return to Cru."}
{"text":"A wonderful addition to Cleveland. We have been missing a classic French restaurant.  I enjoyed my meal and the service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Expensive blandness.  Quite frankly I don't know why this restaurant has gotten such good reviews.  The food was ok but not memorable.  Same for the service.  As for the decor I did not think that many shades of beige existed.  Not a great experience but an average one.  I can think of dozens of restaurants in the Cleveland area that provide better value for one's money, and I will definitely go to one of those places the next time I dine out."}
{"text":"Amazing new French restaurant. Enjoyed delicious food and service, which like Beaujolais Nouveau is working hard and, I predict will soon be 5 Star. Get there soon to join the start of something new and emerging!"}
{"text":"Celebrated a birthday at Cru Uncorked on Saturday. This place is elegant and expensive and probably not for everyone. Nonetheless, the food is elegantly prepared, rich and delightfully tasteful.  There is a wide variety of protein choices and vegetarian options.  Our meals included brazed beef, lamb and snapper dishes - everyone raved about the taste of each. The French flair and skills of the chef are evident throughout the menu.  This was my third dinner here in the past year and the staff and management are attentive and gracious. Well worth the expense if you are capable of $100+ per person."}
{"text":"Went to get a gift card there, weeks after they were opened.  Really, you don't have any!  Besides that I was on crutches and they seemed to get the car doors and inside doors for everyone but me.  Really, I can hardly walk, drove over here to get a gift card and you can't even open the door for me at valet or insde."}
{"text":"This is one of Best restaurants in Cleveland. Perfect food. Very good extensive wine selection from France and all over the world. We ordered a few appetisers, soup and shared the main course. Every dish was delicious and very tasty. Desert - decadent, light- awesome! Will choose it every days of the week and twice on a weekend."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Cru! Is an French- American concept. The space has an amazing design and it is very specious. Giving a great sense of privacy. Food was very tasteful and rich. High Gastronomy.  The wine list was very complete without overwhelming you will numbers. Service was exceptional. This place is great for a more formal date or reunion. Definitely one of the best high end restaurants in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Went with my wife for appetizers and dessert to celebrate our anniversary. First, it is probably one of most beautiful restaurants we have been to (definitely the most beautiful in Cleveland). We sat on a patio and it was just perfect. The service is top notch, very polished. Assistant GM/sommelier (Robert) and our server (Easton) is absolutely top notch, let us try some great wine and ports (as we are not wine lovers, this was great experience to try something very good and unexpected). Appetizer were good, except Foie Gras Gateau (I would skip that dish and take that off the menu), desserts were top notch and dessert wines are great. Great experience overall!"}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere! Overpriced menu that needs more diversity. Our food was delicious but a bit skimpy. The bar was lovely but only open to restaurant patrons so don't think you can stop for just a drink. Stupid business move. Not thinking there's longevity here."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time and the service was impeccable. The wait staff sets each plate down simultaneously and it made me feel like I was in a movie. Truly an amazing experience that everyone should enjoy."}
{"text":"Elegant atmosphere but dark and overbearing. By contrast the terrace is nothing more than basic. The friendly and abundant staff tries hard but lots of missing details bring the experience down from the expectations based on the high pricing. Everyone is trying hard but they are not well trained.  A little off putting when entering into a closed off area before entering into the inner sanctum, much like a private club."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant, came here for a dinner with my family. Service was amazing, the food was delicious. Had the escargot and the burger. Best burger I ever had. Everything was beautiful. Highly recommend for any occasion or just a nicer dinner."}
{"text":"Oh my! This place Is unbeaten!! Great job guys! My third time was wonderful and our guests were pleased with food and satisfied with service! The top!"}
{"text":"We went there after dinner to have drinks and desert. It was amazing service by Denise at the bar area with great decor. Our friends had told how awesome their dinner was when they had gone and it s at the top of our list to go back for dinner and"}
{"text":"Had high expectations for this place and was disappointed. The food was good not great. The service was below standard for a restaurant like this. Don't need to go back."}
{"text":"Ok, so it's an expensive French restaurant.  Look at the menu and prices and know what to expect.  The food & service are excellent.  Looks like from some of the early reviews they may have had some startup issues, but our experience was top notch.  We each had soup.  My wife had the lobster bisque, which was broth based and delish.  If you want a heavy cream lobster bisque, this isn't it.  I had the soup de jour, which was a curry based soup.  Superb.  I had the heirloom tomato salad, which had fresh buffalo mozzarella, making for a tasty version of caprese.  We also had the duck appetizer garnished with cherries.  Perfectly cooked and  healthy portion for an app.  Would have been our best dish had the entrees not come next.  My wife had the lamb and I had halibut.  Both we perfectly cooked and offered wonderful flavors.  Both entrees were well proportioned.  For desert we shared salted caramel creme brûlée and homemade sorbets, along with a French press of Nicaraguan coffee.  Service was impeccable through the meal.  Eastman was our waiter and was great.  Entire staff was attentive & friendly, always asking how the meal was going and if we needed anything.  Classic 5-star experience.  Ambience is a huge plus.  We actually ate outside on the patio since it was a perfect evening weather wise.  The indoor decor and ambience was impressive.  There are 4 dining rooms, each decorated with a different french style.  Overall, Cru Uncorked cuts no corners on decor, quality, or service.  They have 6,000 bottles of wine, and while they have pages of $$$$ bottles, they have plenty in the $50-100 range, if you're looking for better value.  It's not for everyone and not a restaurant we can afford every weekend, but we look forward to coming back for a special occasion or date night."}
{"text":"Love the patio here and the bar menu. The octopus is divine, and the french fries are out of this world.  The staff is as lovely as can be!  I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Everyone of the staff is so kind and attentive, easy to take with and very open! I am here on Tuesday which I half priced bottles under $100!!!!! They have a nice selection...although I wish they had a Schaumburg!!!!!!!! I had the soup du jour, floral salad and the lavender duck....with a bottle of piper...my companion has the halibut!!!  I love in Chicago suburbs and found this place such a treat!!!"}
{"text":"We had the \" inaugural \" brunch today and it was fabulous from start to finish. The menu was amazing and each item that we ordered was delicious.  The restaurant is absolutely beautiful inside and the outdoor seating area looked very nice too.  Our waitress was excellent as well the other wait staff.  This was our first time there and we already booked for  Mothers Day."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but it's really unaware of how off the mark they are in what 5 Star dining should be.   The food was lovely, but the wine cellar is super young and not unique. They do not have anyone to really recommend anything at a reasonable price range. We asked for a bottle between $75 and $150 and of course the waitress recommended a $140 bottle and nothing else! I would have loved an option from someone else if she could not recommend a second option.   We also waited for drinks in the lounge for over 25 minutes and had to ask why we were not seated at our table 30 minutes past our reservation time. I feel that even an Applebee's can find you in the bar!   It just really missed the mark in terms of service and even when the food is delicious, which it was, makes is painful to swallow the expensive tab."}
{"text":"Cru Uncorked is elegant, sophisticated, expensive, and chic. The food is portioned well, with a variety of proteins and preparation styles to choose from. I had the duck, and was pleasantly surprised with the portion size and it's preparation. It came well seasoned and paired with an interesting combination of what I think is a radish drizzled with wine reduction. The most stand out portion of this meal was the dessert - a hazelnut bar that begs to be shared. I highly recommend this restaurant and would love to come back"}
