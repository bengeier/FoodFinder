{"text":"Excellent customer service, very friendly staff, food is delicious the best enchiladas I ever had, I recommend this restaurant 100%  and they have Wed and Sunday all you can eat enchiladas"}
{"text":"All their ingredients are fresh--the tortillas are baked on site and very good. They give you great chips and salsa to start, and even a cup of some unknown but amazing little soup. Plenty of comfortable places to sit with huge windows but the inside is still nice and shady. Friendly staff. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on a whim. We don't go out for Mexican often, but when we do we have high expectations. This place was awesome. It had been open for 5 weeks when we were there and you can see the passion of this family. Decor is fun and cute while still being high quality. Place is clean and spacious. The beautiful owner Tanya came out to say hello and make sure our meals were delicious. Server was kind and gave us recommendations and checked back often. Can't wait to come back and bring friends !  Ps - Wednesday all day is all you can eat .... Come hungry and bring your family.   Great find for a Saturday night dinner."}
{"text":"Being Mexican I don't like a lot of Mexican restaurants, but I would come back to this place again and agin. The service was awesome and the food delicious. Thanks for a great meal"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! Above and beyond customer service,  authentic mexican food.  Best hidden secret"}
{"text":"We were staying at the Luxor casino and decided to eat some authentic Mexican food and Las Enchiladas de mama hit the spot perfectly. ..The service was awesome and the food was perfect and the Chile was excellent!!! The price was budget saving and gave us reason to return again before we leave las vegas. ..IF you're looking for good mexican food this is the place especially if you're on a budget...I PROMISE YOU WON'T BE LET DOWN!!!!  By the way, they have all you can eat enchiladas Sunday's and Wednesday's from  9am to 11pm...F.Y.I."}
{"text":"I saw enchiladas on tv and yelped to find some. I found this place, which was the perfect spot. If you want enchiladas in so many different sauces their menu is strictly enchiladas, so you know what you need to order. I had the combo with three different ones. Each one was flavorful and unique to its own.."}
{"text":"The severs are personable and made you feel like you were the only customer!  The service was quick and efficient. Definitely would go again."}
{"text":"Great service and warm welcome. Lobe the staff wonderful people. Soup and soft chicken tacos is awesome"}
{"text":"Sorry but this was the worst food I've ever had at a Mexican restaurant. I'm assuming they had family and friends write a bunch of positive reviews. I got a bad feeling about the place when I walked in for dinner and the place was completely empty. The chips and salsa were horrible and the enchilada sauce tasted like vinegar. The food came out fast but that wasn't a positive, it wasn't even warm. I had one bite and said let's leave. I told them I was dissatisfied and offered to still pay the bill and they accepted. What?!!!  What kind of business charges someone that is completely dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Probably the best enchiladas I've ever had! Everything tastes very fresh, full of flavor, and perfect balance. Delicious homemade tortillas. Fun decor. Excellent customer service, our waiter was very helpful & friendly, even held the door open for us as we left. Came with my boyfriend, his sister, and her boyfriend from out of town and will definitely return next time I'm in Vegas. I got the enfrijoloadas enchiladas and he got the daily special. I love black beans and these were amazing! Save room for the churros, you will die & go to Ch√∫rro heaven."}
{"text":"The best enchiladas are here - look no further. This is a new place, just opened this summer - 2015. With the exception of the Mole sauce, all sauces are family recipes. The encachuatada and encremada are exceptional. Very welcoming and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place is the best Mexican food in town. So much care goes into the food. The enchiladas are literally made by their MAMA!! These guys don't lie. Eat hear, support this local family restaurant and tell your fiends about it."}
{"text":"I am glad we searched hard enough to find this gem. Everything was so fresh and made after we ordered.  Great service. They are new and weren't very busy yet. I hope lots of people find them."}
{"text":"Great tasting authentic Mexican food here in Nevada ! I'm from California and was in the mood for  some Mexican food when I came upon this Hot New Restaurant that just opened up. Expectations were beyond  exceeded ! Their whole menu looks so delectable. I had to go with what they are know for , the enchiladas. Great Tasting food good service , I highly  recommend everyone to come here !"}
{"text":"A hidden gem for sure. The atmosphere and decor are authentic of Mexican culture. Very clean, very festive. Their staff is very friendly and helpful. We ordered to go. I couldn't decide between the Entomatadas or the Enchiladas verdes so we got half and half, since the order comes with four enchiladas. While we waited I was served a sopa de Fideo that was delish! Their tortillas and sauces are handmade daily. Was very pleased. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Food and service are awesome!! We had multiple types of enchiladas, appetizers and desserts and all were very good. Homemade tortillas for the win!! This is a must try and we will defiantly be coming back."}
{"text":"Not a typical Mexican restaurant. They have a wide range of enchiladas with many great sauces to choose from. Great and fast service!"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to trying this place since the concept sounded amazing.  We decided on Sunday due to the all-you-can-eat enchilada special they advertised, only to find out we were one week too late.  They now have the all-you-can-eat special on Wednesday after 4pm, however call ahead to make sure.  This would have been a great way to try their 3 menu pages of different enchilada styles and sauces.   The place itself is very colorful and big, but with only one server it seemed like we waited a bit on everything.  So I guess you can seat yourself and wait, wait ,and wait.   She finally came over to take our drink order and then shortly came back with chips and salsa.  The chips were underwhelming but then again we did come here for their enchiladas so whatever.  She came back, took our order, and then returned shortly with cups of their Fideo soup.  This was pretty simple but good.    They have about 15 different types of sauces to choose from, and an order of enchiladas comes with 4. You may mix it up with 2 different choices, and you select cheese, beef, or chicken.  We ordered Guajillo, Encacahuetadas (Japanese peanut sauce) Pipian (pumpkin seed sauce) and Mole. We chose cheese as filling for all except the Mole which we chose chicken.  The cheese by the way is crumbled fresh cheese, so don't expect melted shredded cheese like I was.  All were uniquely different and made with fresh corn tortillas and served with rice and beans, however our food was served warm almost cold.  We waited a good 30 minutes for our food so I did not expect warm food. This spoiled it for me. Sauces can take on a different taste when served warm or cold and was just a turnoff!   There were only 2 other occupied tables and they had alreadybeen served so there was no excuse.    The food wasn't awful but I am sure we would have had a different experience and been able to recommend should they have served hot food.  We should have said something, but instead we just won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Generally speaking, food described as \"like mom's cooking\" tends to be made with love, but not so much flavor- gotta make sure it's not too spicy for your sister, not too salty for your dad, and take into account everyone else's flavor preferences and dietary restrictions, too. This spot has a great variety of enchilada sauces, friendly family service, and a huge dining room to bring your whole crew. Note their Wednesday AYCE special.  Ordered a combo plate to go- one red beef enchilada, one green chicken enchilada, and a beef taco, plus a side of guac. Food was good, but as others have said, the amount of meat in the enchiladas is minimal. Plate overall was a good sized portion, and I liked the red sauce more than the green. I do wish they offered a Tex-Mex version with shredded yellow cheese instead of exclusively using the crumbled white cotija. Guac was fresh with tomato and onion, definitely get an order to share.   I called ahead after reading other reviews that said wait times could be lengthy- my food was being brought out right as I walked in, 15 minutes later. I would consider coming back if in the area and specifically craving enchiladas, and try other sauces. However, I think they need to step it up a little to stand out in a neighborhood packed with Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place with authentic Mexican plates. They have an incredible variety of enchiladas and each one has a unique flavor. I live in California and there is no place there that can even compare to this restaurant. If you are looking for a place for truly gourmet Mexican taste this is your place."}
{"text":"New to The Vegas area and discovered this gem. Very friendly and good service. And most importantly the food is REALLY good! The best salsa in my opinion! I found my new favorite spot. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been on Yelp for a while now and never wrote one review. This is my second time eating here, and I couldn't help it right one. This place is absolutely amazing!!! Everything is homemade from their tortillas to their salsa. Their enchiladas are incredible, and so many different ones to choose from. Every Wednesdays and Sundays they have unlimited enchiladas, so you can try all the different flavors!!!  The customer service is amazing as well. So polite and respectful, they really make you feel at home here. This will be my go to spot for now on. If you ever get a chance I highly recommend you check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"I love it here. Enchiladas are my favorite food & this restaurant specializes in them. They are so delicious. I ordered 2 Moritas & 2 Rojas. It's great that you can mix & match. Also, this place has wonderful service! We sat at the bar & were greeted immediately by 2 very lovely employees. Both made suggestions as we browsed the menu. We got take out & the service was super fast. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food!!! Service was excellent. Definitely would come here again."}
{"text":"I love the service and the food!!, the location didnt seamed to help cause it was empty, somebody know if they move somewhere else???"}
{"text":"Wonderful mom and pop restaurant. When another table asked for tapatio, the waiter said they didn't have it, because they make all the salsa and sauces they serve there fresh. Also, I don't know what they do to their black beans, but they are amazing! Good food and superior service. I couldn't make up my mind and the waiter suggested I get half of one type of enchilada and half of the other. Both were so good! I had the mild red sauce and the sour cream sauce. They were both good, but I enjoyed the sour cream one a little bit more. It's great if you're a spicy wimp, like me."}
{"text":"Oh yes! The food was terrific, fabulous service and clean! We will definitely make this a regular stop when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This would be a great place to throw a party! It so clean, spacious and authentic Mexican. Great enchiladas and a very gracious waiter."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant tucked into a plaza. On our way to super cross and decided to stop for a bite to eat. Nice waiter, great food, homemade tortilla was great and the chicken mole is tasty too. Will come back again :)"}
{"text":"Excellent options. Great portions. Wonderful favors. Several varieties of enchiladas and accommodating to vegetarians and mixing and matching flavored. Very nice people. Friendly and attentive. Good chips and salsa, and soup. Well organized and easy to follow menu. The music and restaurant decorations are festive. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, spectacular, tasty, and yummy food. Had the mole and guajillo beef enchiladas, they will mix different flavor choices. The tortillas were fresh and perfect for wiping up the extra sauce on my plate. Soup, black beans, and rice tasted great. Coconut cheesecake was a delicious finish to my dinner."}
{"text":"We went here because we saw it on Yelp, of course, and would never have found it otherwise. Too bad, because it's located in a strip mall on the East side, unfortunately notorious for being half full of vacant storefronts, so you don't just stumble across it.  It's pretty spacious and clean, with your standard Mexican fiesta decor. Of course, my friend and I had to sit at a table with two pink chairs so we didn't have to fight over one.  The server was a sweetheart and very patient about describing the menu with it's many sauce options to my friend, who lives in mortal fear that someone will order something better than what she got.   The chips and salsa were just ok, but that;s not what you're here for. Fideo soup is a pretty good version of a dish for which we have no expectations anyway.  The enchiladas, on the other hand, proved to be mighty tasty. I thought the tomato sauce would be like standard red enchilada sauce, but it was very light and fresh tasting. Nice, but I prefer more complex flavors, so my favorite was the pumpkin seed. It was very deep, mellow and toasty with just a tiny bit of sweetness. Really should have tried the mole but  I was intrigued by the variety of exotic combinations.  The plan is definitely to go back on Wed. or Sunday when they have AYCE so we can try 'em all.   And to walk in first and grab the pink chair."}
{"text":"Really good food. I literally felt like I was in Mexico because the AC was off. It was hot in there. I didn't care as I was there for the food. I also wondered why it took 12-15 minutes to get our two entrees ready. Usually Mexican food for lunch is like a 5 minute meal. After tasting the meal I realized why. Everything was fresh even the corn tortillas! My chile relleno.. Spot on. They have 6 different sauces of which one is vegetarian, the verde. It was fresh and the flavors popped in my mouth. I also had the darker red sauce. Forgot the name. It was a medium sauce shown in my picture. Also perfect.   After coming to Vegas so many times we finally started leaving the strip and glad we found this place. At $10 an entree it's a steal! A must try."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. This is a hidden gem for folks that enjoy really good enchiladas."}
{"text":"I love this place! I hope it catches on soon. I would love to see it packed.   Family owned and operated, the chef/owner makes all of her sauces fresh daily and  the rice fresh regularly throughout the day. I've never seen so many choices for enchiladas. I tried several of them and enjoyed every one. Unique, authentic, and delicious.   Lots of charm, amazing food options, family-owned, and alcohol is served. Doesn't get any better than that!"}
{"text":"So.....the 5 star average for yet another Mexican Restaurant kinda fooled me again, leaving me with an A-OK visit....What I've noticed so far is that Eastside eateries are hit and miss.  This is a very spacious spot with very friendly service, but we came for what they are supposedly known for...their Enchiladas. About 14-15 different sauces to choose from, all made from scratch, and the tortillas here are made from scratch and not out of a bag....prices are $9.95(cheese), $11.95 (chicken), and $12.95 (beef) and come with four to an order(folded over taco style, not rolled) You also get rice, chips and salsa, beans(made with lard), greens, and Sopa de Fideos. Very plentiful and filling as well. For those who can't decide on what sauces you want on your enchiladas, you can do 50/50, with two different sauces which is what we did. I saw on the menu that you can also customize your plate for $10.95. We shared the Guajillo, Mole(with chicken) Encacajuatadas (Japanese Peanut and chili sauce) and Pipian (Pumpkin Seed sauce) Enchiladas.  For me, the flavors of the sauces were good,(chicken was minimal and bland) but my main issue was that both plates were room temperature to cold (the soup was even warmer) Common sense is that hot food is served hot, cold food served cold, nothing in between. Also, for those of you who are used to cheddar or monterey jack in your enchiladas, Queso fresco, a soft crumbly cheese is used for everything. You won't get that ooey gooey cheesiness here.   The whole back of the menu is non-enchilada items FYI, and they no longer do AYCE enchiladas on Sunday...It's only on Wednesdays after 4pm...I'm glad we at least got to try it out, but are in no such hurry to return. ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  3"}
{"text":"Came here with a large party (11) a half hour before closing hours and we were treated very very well. Our Waiter was very helpful and extremely attentive to everybody and literally running back and forth. The fideo soup was really good, slightly on the salty side but very flavorful. Chips and salsa were fresh and tasty as well. The food was amazing. I had the Chile relleno was one of the best I have ever had. I highly recomend getting the combo of chil relleno, taco and enchiladas. Some of our plates did come out later than others, but not too long and they gave us extra tortillas (which were made fresh!) and they gave the person who waited longest an extra taco. Desert was also great."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place! The enchiladas are out of this world! Our plates came with Fideo soup which was a nice bonus. As soon as I tasted it I said \"somebody's mama made this.\" You can taste the love in the food. I had 3 enchiladas: chile verde w/chicken, mole w/chicken and chile pequin w/ cheese. The pequin was HOT but I LOVE LOVE LOVE spicy food. It was incredible. The chef even came out and asked who had the pequin? I raised my hand with an empty plate in front of me. She was impressed, even bowed lol. Not bad for a gringa! The beans and rice were spot on too. I usually need to add salt and/or tapatio to my plate but everything was seasoned to perfection. can't wait to come back!!!!"}
{"text":"There are so many different type enchiladas to choose from - all freshly prepared. The enchiladas verde were excellent and will always be my first choice.  You could taste the fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"I decided to try this restaurant because it was near my doctor's office, and it had great reviews. I was a little startled when I went in, and it was totally empty. I stayed anyway and am very glad that I did. It was delicious! It started off with chips and salsa. When I asked for hotter salsa, he was quick to bring me some.   I had the Enchiladas de Chili Verde with chicken. They were hot, hot, hot just the way I like it. My meal came with soup, four enchiladas, refried beans, and rice. The enchiladas weren't rolled or flat which is the only way I have had them before. They are folded over like tacos. The beans were black refried beans and delicious. That was the first time I had refried beans that weren't pinto. The plate was large and full of food. I couldn't come close to eating it all.  They have the largest selection of enchilada sauces I have ever seen. Of course, they have the standard options, but they also had sauces like pumpkin seed, black bean sauce, and Japanese peanut. I just wish this place wasn't across town from me. I hope business picks up, so they can stay open.   My only criticism is that I would have preferred the home made corn tortillas to have been a little thinner."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Delicious food. Clean and colorful venue. I came in after seeing pictures on yelp and it was definitely accurate. The food server was very nice and had a great attitude. I sat at the bar area, was served chips and salsa and then a cup of fideo soup, all delicious! I'm a hard critique when it comes to Mexican food as I come from a Mexican family who cooks authentic food. Plus I don't live here in Vegas, I live in California. This place is definitely a nice restaurant all around. I will come back. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"So many enchiladas to choose from. We each had a different one and both were amazing! The portions are large, and try to save some room for the churro dessert, so good!  Would most definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I took my family to eat breakfast at this place this morning, and I've got to say that it was awesome!  I had the #1 special, that also came with a fideo soup, which was also amazing, so much so, that my son also ordered another bowl of it, after he ate his soft taco plate.  A must visit gem when in Vegas for awesome enchiladas."}
{"text":"I had an enjoyable meal of enchiladas rojas.  They start you with tortilla chips and salsa--their salsa is quite spicy.  Then fideo soup before your entr√©e arrives. The enchiladas were very good. I ordered them with steak, and was surprised that the steak was on the side, not inside. The meat was rather tough--if I did it over, I'd order either ground beef or maybe try the cecina.  The enchiladas rojas rate 2 peppers on a scale of 0 to 4 on their menu, but after the spicy salsa, the heat was only just noticeable."}
{"text":"The best enchiladas I have ever had. The tortillas and sauces are made fresh daily and are delicious. The refried black beans and rice were also fresh and amazing. Mama and family cook the food with love and it shows in their product and service. There are many choices of sauce and they gave me a taste to make sure I was happy with my selection. I am looking forward to coming back. I had the steak and it was great."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and amazing service! The place was pretty much empty on a Wednesday afternoon, I really hope they're still open the next time we visit Vegas. TRY THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"OkSi pudiera darle 100 estrellas a esta comida se las daria,, tengo 15 a√±os cocinando y me encanta degustar la comida en diferentes restaurants, mis respetos para esta comida,, la variedad en savores hace de esta comida,,AUTENTICA COMIDA MEXICA,, quisiera vivir aqui en vegas para venir todos los dias,,"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pumpkin seed sauce enchiladas I've ever had. The service is great and the owner is beautiful."}
{"text":"Found this on yelp while driving back from a day outside Vegas - situated in a strip mall - this place needs some work on d√©cor. That said, the horchata and enchiladas were delicious (verdes and morita). It was a low key family type place with good homemade food. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I would have given this place 5 stars if they didn't try to steer me away from the spicy food and then warn me by saying be careful that it's spicy. I love spicy food! So what if I'm white I'm also a chef and know what I like. At least they gave it to me spicy unlike some places I've been to which just assume you don't know what you're talking about and give you mild.  Having said that I'll be back for sure if they made tacos as good as the enchiladas I would pitch a tent outside The food is that good. The enchiladas might be small but they are so perfect you'll ignore the price and order more. Also they have all you can eat enchiladas on Wednesday and Sunday which might be as close to heaven on earth as you can get.  This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I ordered the steak burrito. It came with a side of rice and beans, also with chips and salsa. I have a very big appetite and I had a hard time finishing this it was so big. Cooked perfectly. Smelled amazing and tasted even better. $10.95 for what I got was very inexpensive. I will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Las Enchiladas de Mama is a fantastic place to have an authentic delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Definitely will be back. The Morita enchiladas flavor was delicious."}
{"text":"This Mexican mama is a bonafide boss of the sauce...have eaten in this family restaurant about 3 times now and always get their AYCE enchiladas with a choice of around 16 daily homemade sauces. You get 4 enchiladas to start and then 2 more until infinity moving forward.   The food is excellent, the prices are fair now (used to be great)  and the service is spot on, however, all 3 times I've gone I'm told of policy changes regarding their AYCE deal...maybe these are special rules designed only for me as I don't see them listed anywhere on the menu or chalkboard. I can't really hold it against them as I've been known to inflict Matt Stonie level carnage on more than one AYCE joint in the valley.  Here are gradual price changes...  ----November they offered AYCE steak enchiladadas for $14.95, $0 for refill of steak, chicken or ground beef.  ----December I returned to find they offered $14.95 for steak, but refill of steak was $1, or I could get unlimited chicken and ground beef for $12.95, $0 refill for chicken or steak.  ----February I returned to find they would still honor December's deal, but next week they are starting $9.95 unlimited cheese enchiladas, with $0 refills of cheese, but refill of chicken or ground beef is $1 and steak is now $2 a refill.   You can see how unlimited enchiladas for $9.95 is misleading in the fact that your meal could be double that or more. I get steak is expensive, but the small amount of chicken and beef that goes into each folded enchilada can't be too costly...I'd be returning monthly if they at least would have kept December's deal going. Oh well.  So with a bit of disappointment, why the 5 stars? Simply put, I've never had unique enchiladas with multiple sauces so good...even if some great deals must come to an end.   Bookmark this place and try them out."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!!!! I found my new favorite place to eat! The food is crazy amazing!! I live an hour away but is so worth the drive one way."}
{"text":"Awesome food, came to have dinner with my brothers and sisters at enchiladas de mama, homemade corn tortillas, good Chile rellenos,  and great service"}
{"text":"Enchiladas are some of the most diverse Mexican foods there is.  Las Enchiladas de Mama knows their stuff. They were cooked perfectly.  Some places have chewy, hard, or undercooked sections of the enchilada; which takes away from the flavor, but not this place.  As great as the food was the service was fantastic and everything was done by hand (no factory content). Fresh as fresh can be.  I'm not a big enchilada guy, but this place was excellent. They are new so I recommend stopping by and giving a new local business a shot at impressing you. I recommend the Enchiladas Verde w/chicken and the Entomatadas in a combo plate. They are awesome at letting you try a variety of their selection so you can enjoy the different flavors!  Great service, passionate cooks, and a comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent quality food ,great service at a great price. The black beans and rice are perfectly prepared and the hand made tortillas were incredible."}
{"text":"This new Mexican restaurant gets 3 thumbs up from the Three Amigos. We tried this place tonight with a Restaurant.com gift certificate in hand. When we walked in we were the only customers in this strip mall location. Decor in this large establishment  is very mexican and maybe even a little on the tacky side with all the streamers  and the like in the air and on the walls.  I guess you could call it overly festive.  In all of our opinions it could use some toning down. They have only been open about 4 months and the specialty here is of course the Enchiladas. Our meal started with the typical chips and salsa.  Chips were decent and Salsa was chunky and a little kick.  We then had a great sopa de fideo.  A little salt & lime and the 3 of us finished our bowls. They offer about 9 or so different & amazing sauces and based on the 3 that we tried they were as good as you can get in this town. We tried the Verdes, Entomatadas & Morita. (see the pics of each).  When it comes to sauces they know what they are doing here and they are cooked to perfection  There are 3 price points starting at $9.95 for cheese or plain and then $11.95 for chicken or ground beef and finally $12.95 for beef or carnitas.  These are not your typical triple fold large tortilla enchiladas. They are  single taco size fold in half freshly made tortillas filled with your choice and smothered in sauce, queso & cream.  AND YOU GET 4 (FOUR) Now for a few dislikes from the gringo of the bunch.  The rice while just average had no flavor and was just too plain for a mexican rice.  Also, they only offer black beans. This gringo does not like black beans.  Right now they still have no liquor license which can be a killer for some mexican restaurants especially one as large as this.  We were told by our waiter who is the brother of the owner that they should have it by December 1st. We were told that on Wednesdays they have all you can eat enchiladas, you pay for your first plate and then they will continue to bring you two at a time till your full.   They have a huge chalkboard full of lunch specials with all kinds of taco, quesadilla and the typical mexican combinations. For those hung up on Pepsi as I am they only serve coke product here. We all wish this new find of ours a long life in this hard market and they will for sure see us again in the near future as they do have the best enchiladas in town."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Good service, clean, and the food is on point. If you're craving some good enchiladas then this is the place to come. I had three different ones and they were all different and flavorful."}
{"text":"Second time I come here and will definitely come back again and again!! Their service is always great and the food.. speechless!! Ive tried the enchiladas de mole, the green enchiladas, their enfrijoladas, they are all sooo good!! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The best enchiladas de pipian hands down. I would come here to eat more often but its far from my house. Usually when im near by I stop by for pick up. I love how they have any type of enchilada you could ever want."}
{"text":"Was in the area and decided to stop in to grab a to go order. We were warmly greeted as soon as we walked in. We ordered the enchiladas verde and a half verde half mole enchilada plate. The order came out in a reasonable amount of time.   The verde sauce was probably one of the best I have had, it was a delicious. I did not care for the mole sauce at all. I like the sweeter mole like at Las Cazuelas. The rice and refried black beans were also good and they gave us a large bag of chips as well. As others have mentioned there was only a small amount of chicken inside. For $12 I think they need to be a little more generous, especially when your not doing the all you can eat.   Service - 5 stars Verde sauce- 5+ stars  Mole - 2 stars   I would come back for the verde sauce and friendly quick service."}
{"text":"this is a cute, authentic mexican restaurant on the east side.. i came early in the day (1pm) service was quick.. food came out quick and my waitress was nice.. i had the red enchiladas cheese only.. the sauce wasn't authentic at all to me.. very tomato paste-y.. the fideo soup was great as was the salsa.. i just had higher expectations for the enchilada sauce :("}
