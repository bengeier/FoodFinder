{"text":"Amazing. Stopped here on a road trip driving on I-85. These tacos were so authentic and flavorful! The prices are outstanding and the staff is very nice. I will be back next time I drive through. Be prepared to sit on a stool or stand and eat. It's still a taco truck."}
{"text":"Love Plato Pronto, you can't beat the quality of the food for the price. I stop here at least once a week for lunch. The chorizo torta and quesadillas are incredible."}
{"text":"This is it.  This is the one truck you shouldnt drive past because \"its a food truck in a storage building parking lot\".  The Pastor is out of this world, I highly recommend the quesadilla, its huge.  Hands down the best mexican food around, even from restaurants."}
{"text":"This is by far the best place in Charlotte to get consistent authentic Mexican food. I have never been disappointed with anything I order, although the tacos and the quesadilla are my favorites. If you have the opportunity to stop here, take it."}
{"text":"Very cheap and very good food! Their food is always on point and I recommend all tacos! I've tried the pastor, chorizo, bbq and steak all very delicious.  Service is really great also."}
{"text":"Ordered a Cali burrito and a torta both with pastor. I had the torta and did not especially care for it. The pastor meat had a bit of sweetness to it which was different and disliked. There was too much flavor going on overall and it just didn't mix well. It was kinda like a mush sandwich (due to the beans and soft tomatoes) with sweetened dog food meat. The sandwich was huge tho, could only eat half. I'd probably stick with the simpler menu item like tacos and get anything but pastor."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying \"This is not where the food truck was located\". It was at 7601 Statesville Rd. At a used car shop. With that being said, the food was on point. They accept Visas (which is a plus). 

The food was just right. The mini quesadilla was a good size for someone who wants a quick bite. We had the carne asada tacos and we loved them. 

Another plus was the wait time. I had a pretty large order and they were done within 10 minutes.

This is a hidden gem and I say that because so many people came and went while I was waiting for my order. When I got there, there were already 3 cop cars ordering their food as well. 

This truck is perfect when I want some authentic tacos."}
{"text":"I work up the street from this truck and eat at it at least once a week but have been known to do it twice in one week. Best authentic Mexican tacos I have ever had."}
