{"text":"Wow! I am over the moon to have this new edition in the neighborhood. A huge elevation to the real Vegas food scene (i.e. not overpriced, underperforming Strip outposts of actually good restaurants). Not pretentious, reasonably priced and perfectly prepared. As good, if not better than Scarpetta, but without having to go to the Strip or go broke. Plus, a chef who cares enough about the food to be in the dining room."}
{"text":"Unreal! I am truly blown away by how wonderful my entire experience was.  Everything we ordered was amazing, especially the rigatoni which was cooked perfectly.  A great addition to the neighborhood.... can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We had 6:00 dinner reservations & had to wait 30 minutes. However, they were very apologetic & paid for the cocktails we ordered. Once seated it took awhile to get waited on. Service did improve slightly but could really need some work. The bathrooms need improving too. Not dirty just not nice. 

For the food we ordered:

Meatballs (2 per order....not 3 like the pics) not bad not outstanding 

Zucca flowers: Squash blossoms stuffed with ricotta and fried. EXCELLENT!

Sourdough bread w/oil & butter: crust was burnt beyond a normal char making most of it uneatable but the inside of the bread was good

Bucatini all'amatriciana: perfect amount of spice and perfectly cooked

Agnolotti: could have used a little more squash but still was delicious 

Spaghetti: had a lot of whole garlic cloves in it. The only thing that saved the dish is that they were whole & could be picked out to not make garlic over power everything. 

Overall a pretty good meal for a decent price. We will be back to try again."}
{"text":"Fine dining meets comfort food & feel! Great ambiance and staff. Hand crafted drinks and food from scratch."}
{"text":"Eating at esters is like eating at a friend's house. It's a comfortable atmosphere and the service is casual but thoughtful. When we were at the bar my husband ordered a gin martini and they didn't have pickled onions, instead they brought him a selection of house made pickled items that they did have available. It set the tone for the whole evening. Our server I feel bad I can't remember his name, also had a casual friendly vibe. It was a date night and we did not want to be rushed and he timed our courses perfectly. We did the homemade bread with burrata and basil oil which was so so yummy. We enjoyed the grilled octopus and yellowtail Crudo as starters. I'm always a little nervous ordering octopus because it's one of those really good or really bad food items. Theirs was delicious! It was smokey and grilled to perfection but most importantly very very tender. The tuna Crudo i loved. The fennel, the pickled cherries, the pistachios, they all paired together beautifully. For mains we had the bucatini and agnolotti. The bucatini was cooked the perfect al dente and the sauce was delicious. It tasted like it was slow cooked with love for hours. I loved the mint and lemon ricotta in the agnolotti. It was bright fresh and delicious.  For dessert we had the flourless chocolate cake and the butterscotch pudding, which the pudding is more like a silky creme anglaise and just melts in your mouth it was so good. At the end of the evening we noticed the chef going around welcoming all the tables talking to them getting feedback and sure enough we got an opportunity to talk to him and we even shared a drink together. It was awesome hearing his story and it was so clear his passion for his community and what he does. And we wish him all the best of luck and cannot wait to eat there again and try new things."}
{"text":"To die for! Bread and butter with burrata is a must and the pastas are all truly incredible. Also loved the fish. I will be back again and again. Best new place downtown!"}
{"text":"Glad we made it here! Ambiance was very comfortable and relaxing, even with a full restaurant. We started with the cauliflower appetizer, the crispy capers made the dish! They brought out a warm loaf of chewy rustic fresh bread which we really enjoyed as was waited for our meals. Lobster Nero, bacon pizza with quail eggs, spaghetti with meatballs and one other dish was had...all very, very good!!! We swooned over the pizza crust, with it's perfect texture and flavor. Service was engaging and professional and the experience was complete. If you're in town on vacation, skip the strip and get here."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a friend and decided to give it a try. We ordered few items off the menu which were alright. The most disappointing part were the drinks. I ordered a dirty martini which came in this ridiculous, tiny, plastic dollar store bought martini glass. When the waiter brought it out I really thought it was a joke. I wish I had taken a picture. My date ordered Wine which also came in a tiny plastic wine glass. I could have overlooked all that had the food been amazing. With that being said I will not be returning here and will not be recommending this place to any of my friends."}
{"text":"The meatball sandwich for lunch is everything!!! So good! Service is super friendly & amazing mocktails :)"}
{"text":"Best Italian food! Their pasta and pizza are by far the best food I've had downtown, I promise you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Really incredible food and service. We sat at the bar not drinking as we may have had a few too many in The Laundry Room last night. 

At Esther's Kitchen, Keith our insightful bartender was happy to mix me a non alcoholic ginger cocktail with chamomile trimmings. We ordered the housemade sourdough and burrata. Holy - tomolely it was a loaf of bread that was warm and so delicious. Then we shared some Spaghetti Squash and the Mushroom with Polenta from the Verduras section of the menu. It was a perfect supper for a cool Las Vegas night. 

We watched as the pizza and handmade pasta left the kitchen to fill other tables, wishing we had room in our bellies to order. It looked so good. We will be back. If not this trip then next. 

Please if you are in Las Vegas get out of the strip and come eat at Esther's Kitchen. It's truly worth the visit. 5 stars and more. Great bar staff too. Thanks Keith."}
{"text":"Wow- Get yourself to Esther's Kitchen. Chef James Trees shares his heart and soul with us through his incredibly delicious, thoughtful, and beautiful dishes. His restaurant is a friendly neighborhood place where you are likely to run into people you know. Service is warm and attentive. Craig, the manager, is very welcoming, kind, and professional. The Chef took the time to visit the tables and talk with his guests. Everyone worked in harmony to make our dinner with friends very special. 

The bread is spectacular, as is the house made burrata and butters. The polenta is comfort food at its best- I had it last night, and I am craving it again already! The pastas are heaven. Parsnip risotto, and spaghetti squash with pomegranate, mint, & ricotta salata are thoughtful and delicious. The chicken is wonderful, and the porchetta is absolute perfection- crispy skin, tender, juicy, and full of flavor. All of these dishes (except the bread and pasta) accommodate gluten free diners, too! The cocktails are well-crafted, and the wine and beer list has some tasty gems, and is refreshingly affordable. 

Thank you, Chef, for opening such a spectacular restaurant off the strip here in Las Vegas! We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  We sat at the bar and had the sourdough bread......amazing!!  We shared a salad and pasta dish.   We will be back......another great restaurant in Vegas"}
{"text":"My new fave restaurant in Vegas! Me and my friend went for lunch, sat at the bar, and it felt like everyone who worked there said hi! Super nice bartender (Kevin), happy hour wine (it was friday lunch and we got a bottle of chardonnay for TWENTY BUCKS) and we both had delish salads. I'm def going back. Can't wait to try all the more carby things on the menu. I was def eyeing the pastas on all the other tables like a creep. Sorry if I stared at your noodles. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing food.
Great cocktails.
Friendly service.
Wine list and value unreal .
Can't believe a restaurant this awesome is in LV but how do you expect anything less from Chef James Trees .
Thank you chef can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Had an amazing meal at Esther's Kitchen last night. You could tell the pasta was handmade. The chef came out to make sure everyone was pleased, boy were we!"}
{"text":"Incredible experience 

First, you have to try the Burrata - it is the freshest most amazing I have ever had, flown in from Italy and is off the hook fresh 

Second, service is awesome and we met Chef Trees who is also the owner.   Super nice guy, great waitress (JoNeale) who is the best 

The pizza was so fresh, the pasta are fresh 

This is a killer restaurant I will go back to many times!!!!

Three Thumbs Up"}
{"text":"Great Italian in the Arts district. We really enjoyed the carbonara w bacon and peas. The staff was great. Counter service at lunch. Nice space. Good vibe.

Only small disappointment was the chicken parm sandwich. The chicken was tasty, but the bread was a very dense, dry roll (maybe potato bread?) which was a bummer bc the meatball sammy had a nice roll and we saw some bread /oil appetizers that also looked like special bread. Even dipping the roll in carbonara sauce didn't fully salvage it. Also, we were expecting whipped burrata on it and what we had tasted like regular mozz (tasted good). That said, we take our parms seriously, so perhaps someone else would be good with it.

Overall great addition to the arts district!"}
{"text":"One if not the BEST meal from start to finish that I've ever asked in LAS VEGAS! Farm to table craft cocktails and real people making REALLY REALLY amazing dishes!"}
{"text":"I have to type this for my wife because she is still paralyzed by a state of ecstasy status post dining at Esther's Kitchen this evening. The woman loves food and says it very well may have been the best meal of her life. Each course was better than the last. We started with the burrata and cultured butter with fresh bread -- just those alone were worthy of plate licking. The polenta with mushrooms and truffle butter -- if you get nothing else, order this. Amazing. All their pasta is fresh and house made. The cacio e pepe was better than what we ate in Tuscany. And oh my Lord, the desserts! We shared the butterscotch custard, chocolate torte and buttermilk panacotta -- each unworldly. To top it off, the chef came out to chat and was kind and welcoming. We could not recommend this place more. As much as we loved the affordability compared to everywhere else we ate in Vegas, they deserve to charge so much more for this incredible food."}
{"text":"Seriously underwhelmed. 

Locals have been aching for this joint to open, what with the hype, pomp, and circumstance lasting for months, if not a year now. It seems like forever. And with the disappointing closure of Rock'n'oodles (a superb, diverse, and affordable pasta place) around the corner, people have been burning for a business to fulfill the need.

Esther's doesn't cut it. Not on this venture. For one, it's pricey. Which is fine, but if you're going to do your part to gentrify the Arts' District of all places, the quality had best be there. It's not. My dining companion and I each had a glass of wine at $10 a pop, no matter which you select; this model I like, but that's about it. We shared the Weiser's Parsnip Risotto, the squash agnolotti, and for dessert the butterscoth budino. 

In short order:
The risotto was the best of the batch with its artful parsnip adornment, but at $16 for a vegetable plate, it's pushing its luck. 
The squash agnolotti was the prime disappointment. We love pasta, but the flavor wasn't there. There was nothing exciting about it, and once again, I can do better at home. The squash was diced small, so barely recognizable as such. The quantity, or lack thereof, made both of our eyes pop when the plate was presented. $21? You're paying for the IDEA that Esther's Kitchen is high-end dining. 
The butterscotch budino was tasty, but once again, lacking in quantity. It barely filled 1/4 of the glass it came in. Truly, our glass was half empty. Sad. 
$70+ for that night, and for showing an out-of-towner a restaurant people have been excited about forever. Meh. 

So yeah, I've experienced better, and for a whole lot less moolah. At these prices, and that quality, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Such a cute little place in the arts district downtown. It was packed on a Sunday night, but lucky there was an empty table. Ordered the sourdough bread and forgot the name of it, but it was squid ink deconstructed lasagna which was really good! Our server was also very attentive. Will have to come back to try more."}
{"text":"So delightful that more restaurants are opening up near main street! Esther's Kitchen reminds me of the home - spun Italian version of Carson Kitchen.  Cool vibe,  excellent service,  and food to die for.  

I went in on a Sunday and was lucky to get a spot for 2 at the bar because this place was hopping! They do take reservations though,  and I'd recommend them on any busy time or night.  The ambiance is chill and upscale at the same time,  and the bartenders were super friendly and accommodating.  They even made my friend a special mocktail to go with my cocktail because he doesn't drink.  

We ordered the charcuterie, which was nothing short of spectacular.  All the cheeses, all the meats,  that amazing rustic Italian bread and... wait for it...FOIS!  Delish!  And the carbonara was fantastic! I had to of course try the panna cotta for dessert and was not disappointed.  

I'll be back,  the bar was so friendly and the beer list was so dense, I might just make it my new watering hole!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My husband and I wanted to try something new for our first date night in a long time. We usually stick to our usually venues but we decided to take a chance on something we've never tried before and were pleasantly surprised at how great everything was. The atmosphere was so lively from the welcoming staff to the others around us enjoying their meals. I love the decor and how open everything is. 
Our server, Patrick was fantastic. He was super friendly and gave us the run down as first timers and even though he seemed extremely busy, he never neglected to make sure our waters were immediately refilled and that we had everything we needed. I loved how all the staff paid attention to other tables and helped out even though it wasn't their table. You could tell they all worked together great which really makes a difference. 
The food was OMG awesome! We had the cauliflower appetizer which was seasoned perfectly and had a really nice light crunch to it. My husband ordered the house fish which he must have really enjoyed because it wasn't on his plate for very long. I had the white pizza. I was really surprised with the flavor. It wasn't at all what I was expecting or have ever experienced with white pizza before from other places. I really enjoyed it even though I couldn't finish it all. 
I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for an upbeat new age place to eat with classic Italian dishes."}
{"text":"Amazing!

Get there early to get their Porchetta.  We had the Caesar salad, spaghetti polpette, fontina egg pizza and Porchetta.  Everything was great."}
{"text":"Had a business lunch meeting here. Two had salads and two had pasta. Both pastas were excellent. Carbonara and the Bucatini. Wines were also very good.  Chef and owner came to speak to our table. Entire staff is very excited, humble, and proud to be here. You can feel that they all want to make it a success.  If the food and service level continue as we experienced it, I can't see how they won't!  If I lived in Vegas I would be back to try their dinner."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to dinner here. Homemade pasta is my favorite thing. Sadly, I was disappointed. The pasta was so overcooked, it was mush. The meatball was grainy. The server was friendly, but forgot to being my brother and my drinks amd we finally had to ask another server to bring them. The place was so loud, it was difficult to hear the person next to me."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best food and experience I have had in a long time.  The food was delicious and the presentation spectacular.  I watched dishes go by and I wished I could eat more.  The pasta should not be passed up.  Amazing.  Micah was our waiter-all I can say is thank you for making us feel so at home.  So warm, welcoming and attentive.  Don't miss this food and dining experience.  I cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great menu, original, fresh Italian dishes. The bread is to die for. Love anchovies, they offer anchovy butter to go with their very crusty, simply wonderful bread. Friendly, knowledgeable servers. Buy the kitchen a round of beer, $6!"}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience at Esther's Kitchen!  I'm from L.A. and have been to many \"farm to table\" style restaurants that offer craft cocktails but I have to say, from the food, to the drinks, to the overall service Esther's truly blew me away.  
We made a reservation and I'm glad we did.  The place was packed an hour into service.  Our server Zack was not only courteous and professional but he help us with our experience every step of the way.  

DRINKS: We ordered craft cocktails first which were amazing!  If you can't decide, I encourage you to order the \"dealers choice\" which is a drink of choice by the bartender on that particular day.

APPETIZERS: We had the fresh baked sourdough bread (it's a full loaf so don't get full) with cultured butter with olive oil, cracked pepper and sea salt.  We also had the perfectly cooked meatballs with a beautiful sauce with pesto on the bottom.

MAIN COURSE:  We had a white truffle oil pizza with leaks and fresh grated parm on top.  If you've never experienced a top quality white pie I suggest you try it.  We also had dish that had strips of lasagna pasta died with squid ink with huge chunks of lobster topped with a beautiful homemade marinara sauce.....WOW!!!!!!!!!!

DESSERT:  We had the amazingly delectable Butterscotch dessert with a caramel layer topping with a dollop of fresh whip cream sprinkled with some flavored sea salt.

Some establishments boast about being this type of restaurant but don't reach the mark.  Esther's is not trendy but real.  You can feel the love and dedication in the food....AND their menu is seasonal so you are always in for a high quality menu that changes with amazing produce in season.  The head chef has created a delightful menu that is sure to please the palette.  I will definitely frequent this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Ok I hate giving this place 2 stars. The first time I ate here it was incredible. I ordered the fish entree and water because i was nearly 9 months pregnant. Citris oil and fennel with these incredible potatoes and perfectly cooked fish. It was the only thing on the menu I could eat because I have an allergy. To butter milk and cheese. Like not poop your pants allergy, like every dr at southern hills hospital knows me allergy. Like I went out to eat and my throat is closing allergy. Like a dr telling you cant do this anymore allergy. So I was thrilled about this fish dish at the cute place that I could eat. So I made another reservation for last night for my other halfs birthday. Everyone ordered all these incredible dishes. The beets, the cauliflower, pasta, and I sat drinking a bubbly pino which was great patiently waiting for the fish dish. Well the waiter came back and said I couldnt hv it because there was butter in it and they couldnt mod. I told him that was the only thing I could eat last time. He said hed go back and ask. Back and forth they said okay well mod the fish and give you last weeks set up of the dish. Well maybe I upset the chef because the whole plate was burnt. The potatoes were burnt black and shriveled. The fish was burnt. The fennel was replaced with endives and were charred. It was almost inedible. But I politely ate the burnt fish and watched everyone else eat and drink. And our guests left and we stayed for dessert and digestif. Which our waiter brought us 3 drinks. One tasted and smelled of novacaine. When we brought this up to the waiter he compared it to a urinal cake. Confused as to why he would choose this for us as he thought it was that vulgar was off putting. The dessert was the third on the list topped w honeycomb. My boyfriend described it as root canal sweet and took 2 bites before we left mildly full and dissapointed after a 250 dollar bill. I understand kitchens not wanting to mod dishes. I get it. I hate being that person that cant eat anything. I hate being the complicated guest. But I also cant help that I have this allergy. So if you are like me I'd avoid Esthers Kitchen."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. 

We ordered way too much. Bread, charcuterie, spaghetti, polenta, cavatelli, and pizza. Not one thing was terrible!

Our server was a little odd and didn't know the menu at all but we managed to work around that. 

BUT the food speaks for itself. Can't wait to get back here."}
{"text":"This is on my top 3 list of favorite restaurants in Vegas, easily. I recommend the Meat and Cheese plate. For two people, it is so plentiful that it could serve as your only order and still be satisfying. The gnudi with beats are delicious. The pizzas are unusual, yet work, very well. The black pasta is good, the risotto is good. There burratta with bread is great. Each cocktail is crafted perfectly, their version of Blood in the Sand is one of my favorites. I haven't had one thing here that has been disappointing!"}
{"text":"Overall this place deserves 4 stars (I almost went with 3 stars). First, our table of 5 made reservations for 8:15 and we were not seated until 8:45. What is the point of making a reservation if we have to wait over 30 mins more for a table? Second, Esther's Kitchen has no condiments, at all. My friend wanted a side of ranch to dip her hard crusted pizza in and the waiter said that they do not offer any condiments, including ranch. Next, the portion size of the food (compared to the cost) is small. Everyone at my table left feeling hungry for more food because everything comes out small and we all ordered different items. We also purchased the bread, butter, oil combo and we were still left hungry. Lastly, they really push their handmade cocktails and wine. The waiter did not offer soda or tea (I really would have liked an unsweetened ice tea). 
On a positive note, the food was delicious! (The food saved their review) The food didn't take long to come out to the table. The ambiance of the restaurant was casual and pretty hip. The place is clean and has a friendly vibe. I plan to come back at least once more to re-review them and try different items."}
{"text":"Good appetizer.   Polenta very nice. Nice drink.  Wine prices very reasonable .  And pasta that was gummy and way under seasoned.  They clearly needed to change their pasta water.  For a restaurant that prides itself on home made pasta not being able to cook it right and season it seems like a major flaw.   Service was sincere but not professional.    Timing of dishes was bad.  Long wait for main course and then not all came together.  With time they might get their act together.  I doubt I'll go back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas the quality of the food is really good and the prices not bad at all comparative with the insane prices in most of the restaurantes in this city .. I Like the pizza , the pasta and the bread very fresh I had a lot of fun  over there! The carbonara pasta isn't my favorite by the way        En español me encanta este restaurante los precios y la comida están muy bien mi favorita pasta es Pomodoro chilli y no es la primera en la carta es como la cuarta pasta (hay como dos pomodoros ) la pizza el pan también están muy buenos"}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent.   Great mix of people brought the family and we all got different items cavetelli was wonderful.  Rigatoni my son licked the bowl clean.   They need to add expressions or coffee. It the food and the atmosphere makes you forget you are in Vegas"}
{"text":"Can't rate this either way as I didn't get to eat here yet. Just an fyi for everyone else, THEY DO NOT OPEN AT 4 for dinner as noted here. They open at 4 for a happy hour bar seating in which you can order pizza and breads. Come 5 o'clock, the entire menu becomes available. Just wanted to let you all be aware as we waited out front for 25 minutes and then had to find another option. Driving to downtown isn't always an easy thing these days."}
{"text":"Well well. A new establishment and yayy for me a new foodie experience. Came in her on a Sunday night, had a reservation but had to wait about 15 mins for my table. Am not too worried about slight wait times as long as staff are friendly. Got a beer and waited outside and enjoyed the fresh air. Dinner and cocktails were awesome. And now am too drunk to post. I had 8 drinks already. Have fun. U will like this place. I don't lie."}
{"text":"Excellent dishes! There were three of us and our waiter did suggest ordering a a dish and a half per person (small portions). You get a loaf of sourdough it's skin is a bit tough to cut through without the proper utensil. I didn't really care for it I have had better sourdough before. However the burrata alla panna was delicious! The yellowtail crudo was really good never had a sweet and savory herb mixture work so well on your pallet before! The herb fettuccini was my favorite dish, from the aldente fettuccine it's confi garlic, lemony flavors plus the clams just superb combo. This dish I wished I hadn't had to share. The margherita pizza was ok nothing worthy of mention. The Mary's chicken...well it was extremely tender which was the best part but it was just a tad bit too salty for me then you had radishes and snap peas that were a bit too sweet I wasn't too big of a fan for the flavors but loved the tenderness of the chicken. Excellent customer service from our server who by the way knew so much about each of the dishes I can tell the restaurant was big on food education because it certainly helped with choosing a dish. He always came by to ask if we were ok and food refill frequency on drinks. One star less only due to address confusion it's not on Casino Center Drive but really ok California had to drive around a few times to finally see it. Really I'd do a half star less but not possible. There is also outdoor seating in the back of the restaurant and I'm not sure they advertise that well enough to take advantage of the weather. It's beautiful in that area as well. 

I would and will definitely return here!"}
{"text":"Dined Sunday Evening 3/25

Seated promptly, restaurant nicely busy. Server greeted the table, offered drinks and explained the menu. It was loud (music) and difficult to hear him and/or discuss our selections. Drinks ordered and delivered in a reasonable time frame. So far, so good. We ordered:

Little Gem Caesar: Presentation-A, Portion-A-, Flavor ProfileA+, Overdressed, so overall B+

Cauliflower: A++++, the stand out of the meal

Stuffed Squash Blossoms: B-

Polenta: A for favor profile, Too much salt, overall, B-

Second Course:

Rigatoni:  Nice Portion, WAY TOO SATLY, C+, hint both the cheese and pork products you are using have a lot of salt. Sit down and eat a 1/3 of a portion. Salt builds on your palate. 

Mushroom Pizza: Sand out, A+, Crust delightful, toppings perfectly portioned and distributed. Flavors heavenly. 

Lobster Lasagne: Fail, Lobster was \"off\" Fishy in taste and smell. The black pasta was a weird texture. In fairness, we mentioned this to the server and it was removed from the check. Also TOO SALTY, Will try again.

Service: Spotty at best. Will not name the server, but he was inattentive and when he was there did not accommodate us. Asked for a second round of drinks. Failed to bring them until he was reminded, well after we had wanted them. That interrupts the flow of the table as we looked around for service instead of enjoying our meal and our conversation. Offered us new base plates after we had put food from our second course on them. Said he would bring our check, then wandered around for a while, chatted with other tables, and after 10 minutes deliver it. Just a mess. 

Wine List: Narrow, odd, need a few higher end options. We would have easily purchased a $100+++ bottle if it was available. 

Interior: Super nice. Love all the eclectic finishes, furnishings and little ouches. Lighting is top notch. 

Management: For a new restaurant, I would expect more \"table touching\". We were thanked by the manager on the way out, but where was he when we were having issues? I rarely saw him at any table or assisting any staff member. Could do more. 

Full disclosure: I work in the industry, management in Fine Dining for 25 years. 

Overall: I admire them for what they have accomplished so far. I expect they will grow. They've got this. Let's support local establishments who enhance our neighborhoods. Look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"An absolutely fantastic quaint spot. The food was outrageous we had the goat cheese with lentil appetizer as well as the Beet gnudi and pistachio pesto dish.  

I had the squad and scallop pasta and my friend had the brick house chicken they were both very good. The next time I come I will absolutely have the chicken it was so flavorful.  

The wine list is extensive with all wines by the glass so we can try a few different ones.  I absolutely loved everything about Esther's and will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Esthers Kitchen but it won't be my last! I had the mushroom pizza and it was awesome. So full of flavor. The homenade crust was delicious too! I especially liked charred kale which accompanied the mushrooms on top. Great Italian food and a super cool vibe; what more could u ask for?! Can't wait to go back for dinner and try the fresh hand made pasta! DELIZIOSO"}
{"text":"There is no shortage of good places to eat in Vegas, especially right on the strip, but the strip is.... Well, it's the strip; crowded, noisy, chaotic, touristy, etc. My wife and I wanted to try something a little bit different so we took a cab to this place on a whim. It'd only been open about 2 months but the reviews were good so we rolled the dice (Vegas pun intended) and we're glad we did. 


The food was amazing. All the pasta is fresh made daily and was terrific. The mushroom polenta and ceasar salad we had for starters were also to die for. (Note: this is a real deal ceasar with actual anchovies so if that freaks you out, avoid this one)


The cocktails were unique and delicious and our server Patrick was friendly and knowledgeable. This place is worth the cab ride."}
{"text":"Final word after finally getting in and trying this place.  Went and got seated promptly with a reservation and the server, Juan was friendly and engaging.  The service was not the most attentive, but it was not bad at all.  The bread with burrata was tasty, nd the meatballs were very good.  Fresh tasting and clearly not frozen.  They were a decent size and came with two good hunks of bread (lot of bread at this meal).  The pastas were good as well.  The cavatelli was delicious although it was not very large at all.  My colleague had the rigatoni, which was about 50-75% more food than my plate, which was odd.  

The positives were that the food was good, the pasta was excellent and we were seated promptly with pretty good service.

The negatives were that this place is LOUD....and I mean LOUD LOUD LOUD.  We spent the entire night engaged in a light shout to talk to each other, and I am not kidding.  By the end, I had a headache and a sore throat.  Clearly there is only so much to be done with the acoustics in this place, but maybe changing the glass front to allow open windows or something, because the noise alone would dissuade me from returning.  Second, the disparity between portion size was really odd and significant.  I mean, really, the rigatoni was almost double the food from the cavatelli.  Third, the prices are steep.  I mean, yes, it is hand made and everything is very good and clearly attention is paid to it, and that has value.  However, a bowl of pasta should not be 21 dollars...certainly not for the size they give you.  At the end of the day, pasta is still just flour and water.  The price for 1 beer, 3 pasta dishes, 2 desserts, meatballs and bread with burrata was 107 I think (100 and something).  A little steep honestly.  Lastly, the panna cotta dessert just was not impressive.  A real mishmash of flavors, that did not really work that well together, with some over pronounced and others barely noticeable, and it was a cream rather than a firmer panna cotta.

Overall, the place serves pretty good food, and if you don't mind the hectic disorganized nature, the insanely loud environment, the slightly steep prices and the heavy plaid/neck beard hipster crowd, then it is a solid choice for pasta.  I would give it 3.5* overall, but since the food it legitimately well executed for the most part, I will round up.  Kudos again to the owner for reaching out after my first terribly abortive attempt to eat there and even offering to buy me a meal to try them out (which I declined).  Still a great gesture though."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure to dine in this new restaurant addition to the arts district during the first week of its opening. The drink menu is certainly the most eclectic I've come across in all of my foodie adventures, offering a couple of classics alongside an array of unique cocktails with liquors I've never heard of before. The appretivo spritz was suggested and enjoyed offering a refreshing mix of citrus and bubbles. My fellow diners and I tasted different vebduras as starters; the best two were the cauliflower and the mushrooms with fresh ground polenta. The cauliflower was lightly breaded and spiced, fried to perfection leaving the delicate cauliflower tender and juicy.  The mushrooms had such rich flavors and complimented the polenta beautifully. The entree I chose was the cavatelli with crispy sausage. The pasta was perfect, not too firm, not too tender. The sauce had such a variety of ingredients making it so flavorful with a hint of spice, and the crispy sausage just added to my enjoyment of the dish. There are no desserts listed on the menu, but desserts were offered. We tried each of them and hands down the butterscotch pudding was the best! Rich, creamy, with butterscotch crunch on top: delish :-) I recommend this place and I will definitely eat here again. The atmosphere is pleasant, providing a nice dining experience for either you and your friends or just you and your honey."}
{"text":"This is a really good restaurant. The food is exceptional, and they offer very good drinks. It is a quaint spot in a nice artsy area. I was in town on business and my colleagues and I all stopped here, and all of us were satisfied with her food. I would highly recommend this place. The staff was able to accommodate us immediately without reservations. Don't forget to buy the chefs a round of beers, relaxed chefs make better food."}
{"text":"This is such a cute hole in the wall located in the art district. I would definitely recommend making reservations. My friends and I were sat at the bar which we didn't mind and were greeted by a friendly bartender. He made me an amazing mock tail, while my friends indulged on what looked like some pretty good hand crafted cocktails. We split a salad a pasta and pizza and I was surprised how full I was. Everything is made is house, which is always nice. They have outdoor seating in the front and in the back. I will be coming back for sure when I'm in town. Keep up the great work guys !"}
{"text":"Found this Italian bistro near Art District, and had dinner here with my friends. Loved the vibe and simple inner decoration. We had a collection of appetizers, and loved the ham and the different kinds of cheese. The pasta had snow peas in it, and I loved these green peas. The Magritte pizza was good too, loved the basil aroma. Good service and decent price. Enjoyed our dinner!"}
{"text":"If you're visiting LV as a traveler/tourist, this spot is TOTALLY worth the bus ride, short drive, or cab/Lyft from the strip. Though they've only been open for a few months, they seem to have a good thing nailed down here. The interior is hip, modern, and welcoming - I love watching the chefs work in the open kitchen. The menu has a great selection of starters, pastas, mains, and drinks. ALL the wines were under $10/glass, and I loved my sparkling rose. Beers are only $5 - yes. $5 in Vegas! We got some house-made sourdough and burrata (incredibly creamy and so good) to start, shared some mushrooms (SO good, with creamy polenta and truffle - thanks to our server Juan for the rec), and each had a pasta. Portions are very generous and food is all fresh - you can see someone making the bread and the pasta in the back through a little window! I had the carbonara (not super traditional, but yummy) & my partner got the spicy sausage pasta which had a really good kick to it and a delicious tomato sauce. We opted for one of the off-menu desserts, which was a creamy and delectable jar of butterscotch pudding. Reservations recommended, but easy to grab on OpenTable if you plan ahead. I would definitely return and will recommend this place to friends, for sure! This was a perfect spot for my birthday dinner - nice food, warm service, and reasonable prices (for any city, not just for Sin City)."}
{"text":"What a great place, Chef owned and operated, Handmade local plates, thoughtfully prepared cuisine. Design aesthetic is reminiscent of a comfortable beach house, great for a date or family night. Open kitchen and dining room are very clean, staff was well organized and hospitable. 
And the bread, the sourdough is magical and worth the trip from anywhere in the valley, a little tempered butter and olive oil was nice but honestly the bread.... Salads with Urban Seed greens, hand-made pastas, pizza, perfectly cooked risotto it's a win wherever you go on the menu. Looking forward to getting back soon to hit the entree section and desserts.
Great addition to the city!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! The decor sleek and nice, very arts district feel and ambience is buzzing!  Music is great and vibing.. and the food! Created and executed by a great local chef
The food is tasty and delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a more upscale Italian  place.  The pizza was delicious, pasta were very good and their selection of appetizers were also delicious.  They have a bar and selection of wines to choose from.  A very nice place to take a date if you're trying to impress them for the first time ."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Superb service! I've been to Esther's Kitchen twice and had a wonderful experience both times. The first time was on a Thursday evening with my husband and two kids. We didn't have a reservation but they were kind enough to accommodate us on the patio. Our water glasses were promptly filled, our food was delicious and speedy and the service was really great. The second time was with two girlfriends and this time we had a reservation. We were promptly seated and we ordered lots of appetizers to share. The beets and the polenta are sublime. The chef stopped by to chat and told us all about the recipes and trust me, they are very layered and require time, talent, and patience. And it tastes like it too. I can't wait to go back and try more dishes."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious with an amazing staff. We didn't have a reservation and a waiter made them squeeze us in, then the dinner and service only got better from there. Go now! Eat the burrata and all the delectable pasta your belly will hold."}
{"text":"Had heard a lot of buzz about this place, so we decided to give it a try before going to a show at The Smith Center. We were not disappointed. I am a huge fan of homemade pasta, and all their dishes feature fresh pasta made in-house from scratch. 
The menu was fresh and inventive while still maintaining Italian authenticity.  Service was stellar, and our server's (Alex) recommendations were on point. 

Be sure to make reservations in advance, because this place fills up fast. Definitely, the hottest place in the Arts District right now. Looking forward to coming back and eventually trying everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying I've wrote a preview review.  But I wanted to write another and update my status of the restaurant. We invited another couple to go with us as part of a early birthday celebration.  We ordered 4 pastas, chicken and polenta.  We ordered pastas we've already tried and knew were good.  Service still needs improvement we were seated at 6 and it was after 7 before any food came.  Between courses new plates were not provided by the time course three came we asked for new plates.  The pastas were good.  But not great. The chicken was very salty a table consensus and with 4 people we ate less than half of it due to the saltiness (not a reorder for us). The polenta was very gritty and not favorable on the pallet (not a reorder for us) We all agreed about the entire meal.  We tried the porchetta on a previous trip and didn't like ty either so we feel main meat dishes are not what we will go there for.  We typically drink amaretto sours and they have lazzaroni which we were excited about and the drinks were great.  I think we ordered 10 sours! Overall though after several trips in to the restaurant we aren't blown away."}
{"text":"If you have not been to Esther's Kitchen yet ......go!  It is amazing everything  from the amazing food to the drinks the hand made dinner plates,  was outstanding . The place has a very inviting atmosphere . Last night I had the pleasure of sitting at the bar and talking to Sonia fantastic bartender. I had  one of the new pizzas but the best part was the POLENTA !!!!  it was amazing ,incredible, addicting.  They asked me \"did you like it, was it good\"   Good doesn't cover  it  , I could hardly speak."}
{"text":"This is probably the trendiest little place with excellent food,Awesome original cocktails, local beers. To die for panacotta with basil pastacio cake and fruit. Great atmosphere and one of the best service staff in the valley."}
{"text":"Cute little casual trendy Italian restaurant located in downtown. This isn't near Fremont Street plus there is only street parking available. It's super close by to Makers & Finders Coffee and Vesta's Coffee Roasters so it's not like you'll be walking down a dark quiet alley. 

For an appetizer, we ordered the sautéed cauliflower in a garlic, chili seasoning with capers. This was full of flavor! Delicious!

For my entrée, I ordered the rigatoni carbonara pasta (there are plenty of pictures of this here on Yelp) and my boyfriend ordered the cavatelli-crispy sausage, smoked tomoato and rabe. All their pastas are made fresh daily in-house too. Pastas came out pippin hot, packed full of flavor!!!! My white creamed sauce with bacon bits is making my mouth salivate as I type this. Yum! Portions were plentiful....definitely enough for leftovers the next day! Prices were great....this definitely beats the heck out of dining at an Italian restaurant on The Strip. 

Great restaurant, very pleased with our dinner and I'm glad I was able to check this place out."}
{"text":"We came based on the recommendation from a local bartender and had a phenomenal meal experience. This is a must try if you're looking to venture away from the strip. Patrick was our server and was fantastic. He was very friendly and provided top notch recommendations. Everything we tried, we loved. The menu is crafted with passion and showcases the handmade pastas. You seriously can't go wrong with anything you order. The entire staff was very accommodating and exceed the goals of providing you a quality dining experience."}
{"text":"Another win for Downtown Las Vegas

Chef James Trees moves back to Vegas from LA to give us house made pasta plus other killer dishes like Meatballs, Brick Chicken, Porchetta and a ton of vegetable dishes to go with great cocktails and wine at unbeatable prices. The room is super cozy and great for drinks with friends or date night with the wifey.

I have only had one meal so far but going back today for #2. Every dish I had was awesome and both Negroni's were perfectly balanced.

Edited:
Second visit was as good as first. Sat at bar and met Sonia. Favorite dish of meal was the ricotta Gnudi with roasted beets and pesto. Get it, you'll love it."}
{"text":"Esther's was amazing! The polenta is a MUST have - absolutely delicious. The kitchen sent us a comped bottle of wine to apologize for the delay in getting our food. We were having such a good time that we didn't even notice our food took longer than they preferred. The waiters, hostess, and chef were very friendly and really cared about their customers. Definitely a great locals spot! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  Bar service was fantastic! Sonia really knows her stuff. They make their own bread and I'm addicted to it. So cut so charming. Chef is standing right there watching the floor. Pizza omg! Just go try it!!"}
{"text":"I was very excited when I was told that chef Trees was coming back to Vegas to open his new restraunt!  His food is always top notch and never disappoints me. Las Vegas' food scene just got upgraded. The dining experience at Esther's Kitchen is the best I've ever had in my home town of Las Vegas.  Traditional homemade pasta cooked to perfection, topped with great sauces like the creamy carbonara. They have warm freshly baked bread to go with all the wonderful choices of antipasto and the cocktails & wine paired nicely with the food. Oh and the amaro drinks they have are the best! I had a chocolate dessert with raspberry cream sauce that tasted like heaven in my mouth. If your looking to take a friend, relative or that special somebody out to a unique and one of kind dining experience then Esther's Kitchen should be your first choice."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Esther's Kitchen the other day.  Reserved table on line.  Quick service with great suggestions from the waiter.  Had the clam pie, lasagna and the butternut squash ravioli.  Favorite was definitely the ravioli.  Area does have its fair share of construction but hopefully it will end soon.  Will take friends here."}
{"text":"What a knock-out dining success! Our date night started off with half a loaf of fresh sourdough warm straight from the oven, with a side dish of anchovy garlic butter (yes, OMG)! We then divided and conquered the herb fettuccine with preserved lemon (fresh made pasta), alongside the branzino with crisp baby potatoes and orange fennel, and Mary's brick chicken. The chef was personable and attentive to all his guests this evening. The staff was delightful and the atmosphere was vibrant."}
{"text":"The menu nearly requires a translator. Despite not necessarily knowing exactly what we were ordering with each dish, the food was amazing. I particularly enjoyed the polenta, the chicken and the butterscotch pudding."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place! Not only is the location awesome, but the service and food is impeccable. You feel as if you are in a hip downtown city like LA, NYE, or Seattle. The cacio e Pepe pasta is my favorite. We will be back as much as possible."}
{"text":"Everything we tried at Esther's was delicious.  I was particularly impressed by the spaghetti squash dish."}
{"text":"What a wonderful find! Delicious, inventive, hand-crafted food, together with warm & welcoming service in a fun Downtown locale. We enjoyed everything we tried, and since there were four of us and we did everything family style, we tried a lot! Highlights included the beets & gnudi, the mushroom polenta, the cacio e pepe, the butternut squash agnotti, and the butterscotch dessert. The bacon/onion/egg pizza and crispy pancetta cavatelli were also great. Thanks to Eric for superb service and to James, the chef, for creating a truly terrific restaurant and coming out to chat with us. We'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"This was amazing!  Such a cool spot away from the chaos of the city.  Fabulous sourdough bread, appetizers, salad and pasta.  We loved it so much that we went back two nights later and plan to go tomorrow night too.  I am here for a week long meeting and have a plethora of places to choose from but we loved it so much that we know we can't find a better place. Do not leave without getting the butterscotch dessert!  The service was perfect both nights.  Can't wait for tomorrow night!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice in less than a week.  It is probably the best Italian I've ever eaten aside from actual home cooked family meals...and it may be better than that.  Between my two visits, I've tried almost all of the appetizers, verdura and pasta and nothing disappoints.  Thr food is all of the highest quality and the pricing is ridiculously low.  Make a reservation so you can get in.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now. The first time i was very impressed I was able to split a pasta with my friend. The ambiance is great, the bread plate massive, and the pasta all made in house how can you go wrong wih that? But then I went back with a large group of friends and we all tried something different. I felt like they had gotten a little sloppy. Portion sizes felt small on some of the dishes not all. The pasta i had was supposed to have bacon inside and where my portion only had one or two bits, one of my friends got the same thing and hers had way to much bacon and not enough of everything else. The lobster lasagna had good meat but the noodles themselves were a little lack luster, the carbonara a little eggy so instead of being lightly coated it was thick. I was disappointed to see the look on everyone's faces, because I had been here before and enjoyed it, but this time it showed that it's a little too pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant on levels.    The staff was on point from the moment i walked in to the last step out the door.  My server, Zack, was particularly attentive to my dietary restrictions, very knowledgeable and down to earth.  But the food!!    The bread is fantastic.   The butter is served at the correct temp.    The Campari salad is delicious.  The cauliflower is THE BEST cauliflower dish I've had anywhere in the world.   The pizza is perfect and the Cacio Pepe to die for.   Props to the mixologist.   The Red Fairy w Harry Strawberries is brilliant.   Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! First time to come here w/my mikey! We got here before they were serving dinner so we sat @ the bar to wait.  The place is nicely comfortable, love the music and the bartenders were nice and informatively sweet. My mikey had a Manhattan and i had the Fancy trees. When we got seated to our table, our waiter was pleasantly professional. Everyone here were very courteous aaaaand the food was mmm mmm good to perfection! I had the lasagnetta lobster and Mikey had the clam fettuccini and oh we had their house made sour dough bread w/this cheese which was the bomb! It's called butatta alla panna lol then for desert budino (butterscotch custard?) but that was good too and of course I had to order their clam bake w/lamb sausage and oregano pizza lol now u know I'm a very happy and satisfied customer and WE WILL BE BACK! Lol thank u smooches"}
{"text":"Awesome from start to finish!! Homemade Bread was to die for with the basil pesto burrata on the side. Little gym Caesar salad was also delicious and have a little bit of a spice to it. The cavatelli pasta dish with the spicy sausage and Pomodoro sauce was absolutely amazing and the bull do you know for dessert hit the spot! Corkage fee to bring your own wine only $20 which is very inexpensive and it's something awesome when restaurants allow you to do it. Patrick was our server and he truly made the experience amazing..super sweet ,very helpful and an absolute delight as he guided us through the menu. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"DTLV wins! Chef James Trees is in the house. Esther's has the potential to be Bestia in Los Angeles and I am excited to see how his menu and pasta evolve over the years. In the meantime, the restaurant has just arrived on the scene and is already the best restaurant downtown. Chef-driven, impeccable quality, nice ambience, open kitchen, great cocktails, etc. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. Came highly recommended from some industry friends and they were spot on. Patrick was friendly, charming, and answered a ton of questions. The atmosphere felt like a warm hug from someone in a chic but colorful suit and quirky glasses. Not too fancy just comfortable. Cool enough, but with a soul and warmth at the same time.

The textures of the food were delicate but powerful, each dish complimented the flavors like a symphony. Everything was  prepared perfectly, and I left there very full but feeling like I got to have really wonderful food that was prepared with great care and immense talent. 

Don't skip the chocolate tart or butterscotch pudding! Order it first if you have to."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to dine with my wife at Esther's on a Sunday evening. I can honestly state the atmosphere is festive, the food is superb, and the experience was fantastic. Be sure and try the homemade sourdough bread, as well as the homemade pastas. While I did not try the the wine menu, upon perusing it, the selections nicely complement the cuisine. Initially I was concerned about the location being it's in what could be considered a seedy area of Las Vegas. As it turned out my concerns were unfounded and the area is certainly on the rise, being near the arts district. Certainly take the time and try Esther's, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The best food I've had in a long time. You can taste the love and attention to detail. Great ambiance, too."}
{"text":"By far the best Italian meal I've had in the United States. We were a group of 4 and tried 4 different pastas along with the chicken main dish at the recommendation of the waiter. Spot on. Great meal and great service."}
{"text":"Really 4.5. Great spot delicious!  I come to Vegas a lot for work and need a good local spot.  I have found it!  You should take the time to  stop in."}
{"text":"well...... we heard it through the grapevine- that a new Italian spot opened downtown. Met two friends during the mid week to try it out, we brought low expectations not knowing what to expect and hoping to be delighted. We were greeted at the door by lady who seemed like she didn't want to be there, and then brought to our table. The waiter was friendly and he knew the menu and made several beverage and food suggestions. the bread service was the best part of the meal by far! it was accompanied by some burrata cheese and a whipped butter smotherred in oil. ALL the other dishes which included  (6 or 7) were very poorly executied and each had major flaws. 
this included in no particular order: cold stuffed pasta,  gummy and under cooked pasta, flavorless sauce, bad quality suasage, a symphony of sour lemon flavor not in a good way, everything was greatly under seasoned and lacking the soul and flavor development of a good quality Italian kitchen. lots of ingredients that had no business even being on the menu and that are not endigeneous of Italian cuisine. i think this was the worst meal i've had in many years of dining out in las Vegas and southern California. -non buono!"}
{"text":"We arrived a few minutes earlier than our reservation time and were seated immediately. Seating was comfortable in one of the half booths. The dining room was nearly at capacity. Service for cocktails and dinner was timely. 
The atmosphere is high energy. Very loud to the point that it was difficult for our server to take our order. Forget about trying to have a conversation across the table.

We ordered the meatballs and the porchetta.
The meatballs come two to an order along with two slices of bread. The meatballs are made with a combination of beef and pork. My wife prefers all beef and said the meat was lacking flavor. 
The porchetta was delicious, tender and juicy from the roasted jus. The roasted whole garlic cloves just melt in your mouth. Under the pork were several pieces of broccoli which was the perfect complement.

Not many Yelp reviews mention the conversation difficulty. I wonder if this night had an overly energetic crowd.
Chef Trees is doing some great cooking but I would prefer a conversation friendly dinner environment."}
{"text":"Great spot for the Downtown neighborhood! From the minute you step through those doors, you can tell lot of care went into all the details."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My new favorite Italian spot. Fresh home made pasta. They make their pasta in house from scratch. It is incredible. The pomodoro is second to none.  If you are just looking to nosh and have a few glasses of wine they have an excellent charcuterie plate. Do yourself a favor and check out this new gem. Friendly staff and fantastic location. My favorite new restaurant."}
{"text":"This last Sunday night we finally were able to try this place, heard a lot about it so we were excited. Two weeks ago we tried to make a rez for a Sunday night and I was told by the hostess we can make a rez but we might not get seated! I was quite confused. Anyways we showed up last night at 5:30, it was busy and the hostess said we wouldn't get seated until 8:45! So we proceeded to leave and a gentleman said he could set us up a table outside if we didn't mind. We accepted and appreciated him accommodating us. We ordered drinks, which i must say were very good the bartender did a great job on my perfect Manhattan. Needless to say we waited an hour and still no entrees, also no appetizers! Nothing had come out! They kept apologizing every 10 minutes. Finally we told them we'll pay for our drinks and go somewhere else, they actually were nice enough to comp the drinks, 2 rounds actually. I appreciate that, but obviously we were very disappointed with the lack of organization in the kitchen, if the kitchen was behind, why would you seat so many guests? This place needs a good manager."}
{"text":"As Artistic Director of Majestic Repertory Theatre on Main St. (self-plug!), I'm always on the lookout for nearby restaurants to recommend to our patrons for a pre-show meal. So when the signs went up for this new place literally around the corner, I couldn't wait to try it out.

What a winner! The ambiance is nice - very comfortable and warm, with a very friendly vibe. And the food...wow! I got an order of the spaghetti squash - it was an adventure on a dish.

Granted this was my first visit, and a quick one, but I'll definitely become a regular and put Esther's on the top of the list for Majestic guests."}
{"text":"This place puts taste and flavors together very well.Service was great also I will definitely return 
When in Vegas and want something different then that strip feel or downtown vibe."}
{"text":"I never do a review on a restaurant besides saying \"the meal was delicious, etc\". However, this place deserves every praise in the book. From the time we sat down we felt the warmth that overtook this room. The servers were so kind, friendly, and most of all made us feel like we were inside of their home. Our appetizers...well there are no words for them...seriously the polenta and mushrooms are to die for, the home made burrata cheese was a ball of soft delicious goodness, and the crudo, well is out of this world fresh and so light that I could have 5 of them no problem. When our pasta came (as you see there isn't a picture of it), it smelled so good that we went right to town and crushed it. Spaghetti, pizza, cavatelli, and rigatoni were AMAZING. Then we closed out with the dessert...and the butterscotch pudding sealed the deal! Craft drinks are also so unbelievable! The best local spot in town hands down. And a big shout out to Chef James! His cooking is amazing!"}
{"text":"I think I might have found my favorite Italian restaurant in Las Vegas. Fresh, handmade pasta at this quality is pretty rare from what I've seen in the area. Esther's has about 6-8 pastas to choose from, all tasty and unique, fresh out the oven. Most are priced around $15 which is unbelievably affordable. Cocktail menu at $9 is cheap as are the beers at about $5, with many local options in bottle and draught. 

Esther's, as of this review, is a reservation must since they seem to not seat the entire dining room at once; perhaps based on not enough servers. Bar seating available with full menu which is nice. 

Our meal began with a Esther style sazerac which really hit the spot. The prosecco cocktail from the menu was tasty as well, with the sage hitting home. Next we had a Caesar salad and fresh bread. Salad was very nice with thick and long romaine. The bread was glorious. I usually get peeved when bread is not complimentary, but for $4 they give you an entire loaf, charred perfectly - really exceptional bread. For entrees we had the spicy spaghetti and the sausage pasta (not sure actual menu titles). Sausage was a true standout. Really full dish with a lot going on. The pasta, similar to a small gnocchi, was oh so fresh. A little undercooked which is perfect for fr shot made pasta. The spaghetti was good but nothing compared to the other dish. 

In the end we are a fantastic and filling dinner with two drinks for less than $75.   Esther's is the new must in terms of Italian off the strip."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, I am not a huge fan of their bread and how much the cook the crust on the pizza but everything else is is the food porn embodied."}
{"text":"An experience! 
This place is popular, for good reason. The staff is hustling the whole night long to turn every table, keep every glass full and smile while doing it! 
We had to wait for our table and the manager accommodated us making the wait a breeze and was communicative and kind the whole way through. 
Food is fresh and prepared with intention, drinks are amazing.
Would definitely recommend especially if you're visiting!"}
{"text":"Finally went last night, make sure you make a reservation on Opentable, otherwise you might not get a table or will have a long wait. We started with housemade sourdough bread with burrata and basil oil and the margherita pizza. The bread and crust were perfect. The burrata creamy and perfect with the oil. For dinner, I had the herb fettuccine with vongole (clams out of the shell) with the lemon preserve. The hubby had the spaghetti with meatballs. You can definitely tell it is fresh pasta which makes all the difference. Both dishes were delicious. The fettuccine would be just as perfect with no protein or chicken. We both had cocktails. I had the vodka bubbly drink and the hubby had the tequila with pomegranate drink. Both were delicious and original. They also have good local beer on tap.

Can't wait to go back and try lunch since I work downtown!!"}
{"text":"Fried squash blossoms were delicious.  I've been looking for these to make or enjoy in a restaurant for eons; very hard to find.   They aren't listed on the online menu but were subbed for the fried goat cheese.  I was thrilled! 

Mushroom polenta - also delicious but a bit rich. 

Popette? (meatball appetizer) was tasty and great reheated.

Porchetta - only thing I wasn't thrilled about.  I expected the outer shell to be edible but it was too hard and chewy.    Is it supposed to be like that?  The pork on the inside was yummy though.

Lamb sausage and clam pizza pleased all.  It was surprisingly spicy.  For me the best part was the crust.  Excellent sourdough taste in that crust. Any of their pizzas will be incredible with that crust. 

Person who took my order was friendly.  Loved the cookbooks to skim at the front while waiting.  I took cell phone pics of a pickle recipe that looked 20 yrs old with lots handwritten notes.

Beautiful interior with my kind of 'vibe'.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We needed a place like this in this downtown area. Delicious and healthy food. And they pay attention to details."}
{"text":"This is a MUST try! It is delicious amazing twist on traditional Italian dishes 
Come in today and make a reservation"}
{"text":"Love Esther's, and especially love how accommodating the staff and chef are! We had an unusual request the last time we were in and the chef graciously made a point to introduce himself and make sure he understood what we were asking. We also requested a cocktail that was not on the menu, to which the bartender crafted beautifully. This place is exceptional and so needed downtown."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried Esther's Kitchen, GET DOWN THERE!
A fantastic hidden gem in the Arts District. Great ambiance with friendly, attentive service, and the food is top shelf. 
Very well done!
i wouldn't try it without a reservation!"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered here was packed full of farm to table goodness.  I even tried a few of their crafted cocktails and they were excellent.
Will be back"}
{"text":"Was very pleased with my visit last week and will definitely be coming back. My mushroom polenta was very tasty, every one else in my group got pasta dishes (can't go wrong with fresh pasta made in house!). The 2 desserts we tried were delicious and I'm sure the others were tasty too. Nice atmosphere, smaller dining room but I believe there is outdoor seating. Make a reservation just in case!"}
{"text":"Esther's was fantastic! At first, I was a little intimidated. The joint seemed way more mature and sophisticated than I, the girl raised on endless breadsticks and minty dessert chocolates... But in all seriousness, you can tell they actually put a lot of thought into each dish, including where the ingredients come from, which is great. Lots of local sources tapped.  Even the plates you eat off of were crafted in town! Super rad!

My party of five demolished a little bit of everything, tbh: meat & cheese board with toasted sourdough and burrata alla panna + basil oil for starters. I ordered the bucatini dish as my main plate, and then later, we shared the panna cotta for dessert. 

The bucatini all'amatraciana was the star of the show for me, however. The sauce alone was perfect. Great portion size as well. I'm the type that purposely saves a little to see if it passes the ultimate test: Does it taste good being reheated for lunch at work the next day? The answer is yes.

All in all, I highly recommend giving Esther's Kitchen a try if you're in the area!

Pro Tip: It seems to be the buzz around town right now (for good reason) so it's super busy, even on a random Tuesday night. I'd recommend making a reservation beforehand if it's more than just you and a friend. They couldn't seat a group of 5 on a whim one night, so they asked us to make a reservation for a later time."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with friends. Waited in line for about 5 minutes to order what we wanted and then were seated.  I ordered the Chenz sandwich and iced tea.  Took another 10 minutes to get water and then our beverage order. I never got the sweetener we requested. Waited another 30-40 minutes for food. Apparently the table number for my sandwich was written wrong or whatnot and the Waitress tried to deliver it to another table who said it wasn't theirs. Instead of coming back to check on us or try to figure out which table was missing an order, she brought it back to the kitchen. 
In the end my sandwich was bland. I heard great reviews about this place but I guess I came at the wrong time and ordered the wrong item."}
{"text":"I recently gave Esther's Kitchen another try, and was so happy that I did! It was a great experience from beginning to end. The food was fantastic; I tried the polenta with mushrooms, the beets, the cauliflower, the risotto and the yellowtail crudo to name a few- everything was delicious. The sourdough bread should not be missed, it was perfect; crispy and crusty exterior with a warm, soft, and airy interior. The cocktails were also perfect-I highly recommend the Mazunte Sour! 
I had the pleasure to meet Chef Trees; what a great guy! Chef Trees is so friendly and genuinely concerned with the customer's experience. I will definitely be back! With so many dining options in Las Vegas, it's nice to find a place downtown/Arts District with great food and cocktails and without the corporate vibe. Esther's Kitchen is a sure to become a local favorite! Best of luck Chef Trees, I look forward to dining with you again soon! :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The in-house pasta maker really does some delicious work. The portions are the right size and the service is very very friendly. Well everything on the menu was delicious as I've had most of it, I encourage you to try the pasta anything as it's made in house every day fresh and you can taste the difference!"}
{"text":"10 stars!! This is exactly what Vegas needs, more super delicious, amazing service, intimate quality restaurant. The food was incredible, the drinks were  really tasty and well balanced. Everything was so enjoyable I can't wait to come back and bring friends. Thank you for opening downtown!"}
{"text":"A wonderful restaurant in downtown las Vegas.  The room is very comfortable.  I ordered the beat  salad and Mary's chicken.  Both were delicious.  I'm looking forward to next time .I discovered this plane by reading Yelp  reviews"}
{"text":"Really wonderfully. Need to call for reservations because the food is amazing and popular. Really brilliant food with simple presentation.  Loved the cauliflower with capers and the panda cotta is something special."}
{"text":"You know those times when you take a bite of food and you need to just sit back for a minute because it is so, can I say, orgasmic?
1-mushrooms with house ground polenta
2-burrata with homemade sourdough bread 
3-butterscotch budino
4- housemate pastas
5- highlight of our trip to Vegas. 
Staff was amazing. This will be on our list for all future visits!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out since I have a deep, deep love for carbs. Homemade bread? Homemade pasta? Need it. Can't live without it. 

We ordered the sourdough bread as an appetizer, it came with a side of butter in olive oil. It was amazing, it was actually the highlight of our meal. The olive oil was so... olive-y. I decided to play it safe and order the carbonara since all the pictures of it on here looked great. For $17 it was kind of bland. When I order carbonara I usually switch out the peas for capers to add some saltiness, but when I asked if they were able to do that the waiter just said no. Why the 4 star rating, you ask? I liked the ambience and the freshness of the foodz. 

There was one thing I'll note, during our meal one of the waiters was getting berated right outside the entrance by his manager. It's glass, y'all. The front of the restaurant is glass, as in, WE CAN SEE. Poor ponytail dude. Some professionalism would've been nice on their part."}
{"text":"My 3 sons and I LOVED this place, and we're sophisticated, well-traveled diners.  The wine list was brilliant yet simple, the service beyond reproach and friendly.  But the food ... we absolutely loved every bite we had and we over ordered because all the choices were tempting.  Don't miss a pizza with a crisp yet airy crust that doesn't sag under the weight of the toppings, and the cauliflower side dish.

Extremely reasonably prices for the quality of the dining experience."}
{"text":"Chef James Trees and his incredible team are killing it! A complete scratch kitchen...something that is tough to do. 

Fresh baked homemade bread (delish) with butter and burrata, all of our appetizers were well thought out in their flavor combinations - Yellow tail crudo- light, fresh and delicious. 

I had the Lasagnette Nero - outstanding! Huge chunks of lobster, perfectly made squid ink pasta with a little chewiness dressed in flavorful red sauce. I can still taste it! 

The Spaghetti with polpette. Again...outstanding. The flavor!!! So incredible.

My fave dessert: the butterscotch budino, though everything was fantastic, that budino won my heart. Next time I'm getting my own...I honestly can't share it and will have to stab anyone's hand who tries to eat mine. (And I usually share everything!)

Thanks to Chef James and the rest of the awesome chefs in the kitchen and staff for such a beautiful eating experience. I will be back...again and again. I haven't felt this passionate about wanting to return to a specific restaurant in a very long time. 

Cheers to you all for creating such a special gem here in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Last minute decision and this won out.   
Arrived with no reservations (didn't think we'd need).   Party of 3 including a four year old.  Here are my thoughts/experience:
1) place is small. They can get a decent number of people in there...and there was!  We couldn't be seated for almost 2 hours.  The noise level was too much for my 4 yr old.  That was ok because the hostess offered us a table out front.  We took it and it was perfect!
2) food.  Had the sourdough bread, the cavatelli, the pasta with meatballs and a dish of spaghetti with just butter for the kid.  She doesn't like red sauce.  
The cavatelli was amazing!  The spaghetti with sauce and meatballs were equally amazing as it was with just butter.  The meatballs were sooo good, too!
Towards the end of the meal, my 4 yr old actually tried the spaghetti with the sauce and LOVED IT!  So much that we had to mix in her pasta with it! 

My complaints.   These are personal thoughts, so I didn't reduce the number of stars lol
-If you offer outside seating, invest in heaters and get the tables level.  Waitress poured glasses of water and it ran right off the table. Maybe try to put up a divider between business and edge of sidewalk?  Maybe a fence?
-the bread.  I don't like my bread to have a black/hard crust.  Would've been more enjoyable with an nice darkened crisp crust.  Just overdone in my book. 

Overall everything was great.  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Esther's Kitchen three times--twice for dinner and this time for lunch.  Lunch is a bit different.  When you enter, you order at the bar from the lunch menu.  Then take a table marker with a card, have a seat, and your lunch is served when it's ready.  

Four of us shared three pastas, two sandwiches, a Margherita pizza, and one dessert.  The two rigatoni dishes were excellent. The one with black garlic and lemon was something very different and delightful.  The sandwiches were great especially the roasted porchetta.

All breads and pastas are made in house and it shows in the fresh taste and deliciousness of them.

Whether for lunch or dinner, this is a place you need to try.  Chef Trees and his staff are doing fantastic things.  The passion with which they cook shines through!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my friend's birthday here.  I'm always wary of Italian food because they always taste like tomato sauce with minor variations.  The food here just blew me away.  What tomato?  Even the spaghetti with meatballs was just a culinary experience.  You can tell it's made with love.  I don't particularly like kale but I couldn't stop eating the kale salad.  And our server (sorry I forgot his name!) was attentive and offered tips on what to order.  I like it when the servers know their menu.  I'm from LA and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious homemade Italian. Great ambiance and very friendly staff. I had the Mary's chicken which was so delicious. I will be back again!"}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary dinner (3/7) and had such great service from start to finish. The restaurant overall was lively but not too busy to where you couldn't hear each other speak. Our server was awesome with drink recommendations and must-try popular dishes. 

I ordered the Cauliflower from the appetizer menu, which somewhat tasted like a delicious blend of gourmet popcorn shrimp but BETTER! As for my entree, I had the Rigatoni Carbonara and hubby got the Spaghetti and Meatballs. We ended the evening with Butterscotch Budino!"}
{"text":"I visited Esther's Kitchen on a packed Sunday evening with the ODB (Ol' Dinner Buddies*) Foodie team...this was as good as it gets!

Esther's Service: Our server was great with suggestions for the table. He keept the water and wines fresh for our party of 7 throughout the night.  The kitchen got our food out timely throughout the night even with all their tables filled, fantastic.

Esther's cuisine: All the carbs are made fresh in house and wow could we tell.  I had the Rigatoni Carbonara and it was delicious.  That grana panada cheese and egg yolk are a great combo to match up with the Guanciale pork.  My ahh dood's Lasagnette nero was tasty, I love the truffle action and that dish brought it.  The Branzino fish was offered that night and it was prepped perfectly.  The preserved lemon that was in the herb fettucini was a taste I've never tried before and worked well.  We grabbed a side of meatballs/polpette for fun and they were yum and large enough to share.

Esther's Ambiance:  The clean Industrial look with plenty of wood throughout the room keeps it casually classy.  A black and white beach mural on the wall really pops and is visually pleasing.  The tables are close to each other but not too close as to take away from the intimacy.  The bar with the blue wall takes helps take care of drinkers and single diners.

The location is deep in the Arts district downtown and is a fine addition to the area. Reservations are highly recommended because the word is out already on how great this place is.  The price point and the quality of food and service is exactly what's making Vegas a foodie city: High quality food and service for around $25-$30 a person.  I'll be back for lunch and to try more dishes at dinner, but that's another Yelp tale.  Enjoy! =)"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this place, but wasn't impressed at all. I felt like it was over priced for the quality of food we got. The wine was good. We ordered the meat and cheese platter. No one explained what the cheeses were, they were brought out staggered instead of at once, and the guy explained some of the meats but \"forgot\" what the other meats were and never came back. 

Then I ordered the spaghetti. In an Italian restaurant the spaghetti and meatball are my go to as they should be perfected. Meatball was alright, but the pasta was almost gross. It was gummy and sticky. Almost like it sat in the sauce for too long and was stuck together. 

Unfortunately I'm pretty disappointed. The atmosphere was nice so hopefully I just had a bad experience, but I won't be going back...ever."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype. 

Going to dinner on a Saturday evening at 7:30 as a walk in is a BAD idea, unless you hope to get lucky enough to sit the bar which i did (thank goodness). My approach to the hostess for two seats was greeted with \"earliest seating available would be 9:45\"...whoa! Seems this place is getting some serious play from the masses and its keeping their reso book filled, good for them! Sitting the bar you are able to be a bit more interactive with the service staff (which i like), and usually leads to a better experience to me personally. Our bar keep was nice enough, making me a mezcal cocktail from the menu that presented better than it tasted. It wasn't bad, i simply would say that it wasn't balanced. My entree was a no brainer, being the carbonara i starred at on Yelp through photos. My response when the dish was set in front of me was \"McDonald's Hamburger\". This of course means that the food served to you never looks like the photos presented. I dug into my dinner hoping that the flavor would overwhelm me and force my return time after time and it was \"Just ok\". My server/bar keep was nice enough but didn't seem overly friendly or interactive, so i felt like this time was a very \"basic\" dining experience. Was anything particularly bad or negative to justify a bad review? I would not say so, and is the reason for the 3 stars. But i also think i can get similar food from a chain restaurant, with underwhelming service, and not have to wait 2 1/2 hours for a seat in the dining room in plenty of other locations.

I am glad the place seems to be doing well, as i want to see the surrounding area blossom but i wont go running back anytime soon."}
{"text":"OMG yum!!! I got to come in on opening day and Esther's Kitchen did not disappoint. It's Sophisticated, Unique, and they pay wonderful attention to detail! Esther's Kitchen is where it's at. Absolutely everything we got was completely cleared off our plates. The lobster Lasagnette (sorry if it's misspelled) was to die for, they put nearly an entire lobster inside this dish. The drinks are unique and beautifully presented . I made a reservation for my birthday. I'm excited to come back!"}
{"text":"Cool little Italian spot in the Arts District. What I liked the most was the vibe manageable size of the place. The decor was nice too and the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"I am French I used to live 30 mins from Italy from most of my life. I like to think that I know what good pasta is. I have been to this place already 4 x since it opened and that speaks for itself. The spaghetti meatball are the best I have eaten in Vegas for the past three years. The service is like family and the chef is also very attentive. 

Tips: order some of their homemade bread, this is what bread should always taste like !!

This place is part of my top 3 restaurants in Vegas, affordable and great quality homemade products.

11/10, great job !!!!"}
{"text":"Bless this restaurant. Downtown needed a restaurant like this: amazing food, service and a very memorable experience!

Lemme tell ya! Came here with friends for dinner and nothing disappointed. Literally, nothing. 

The food crushed it. Service blew my damn mind. The owner came by, chatted us up then served us complimentary after dinner shots. And to top it off, he sold us on all three of their amazing desserts. Get the butterscotch puddling!  

They locally source their food which I highly support. But I still can't believe how amazing the food was.

Here's a list of the entrees we had and all shared:
-Porchetta
-Bucatini pasta
-Carbonara pasta
-Mushroom pizza
-Margarita pizza

If you haven't experienced this place, do yourself a favor and do it."}
{"text":"Made a big reservation (28 people) during CES, on what was I believe their 6th night of service, which means we had approximately half of the restaurant.  It could not have been more magnificent!  Not only was the food absolutely incredible - they bent over backwards to take great care of us!  For a group of food mavens who had flown in from both NY and LA, everyone was impressed, and couldn't figure out how we had found such an incredible hidden gem in Esther's Kitchen.  Highlights were the crudo, the housemade bread, all of the pastas, and of course Chef James himself, who spent time stopping by every single table.  We will be back often!"}
{"text":"So very glad I checked this place out. I'm always looking for new places to try downtown before a show at the Smith Center, and this place is one of my new favorites in town. 

The restaurant is small, so reservations are a must.  Service was impeccable and the food was outstanding.  We even were commenting how the soda tasted better than normal!  Everything was just perfect in every way!  We had the sourdough with buratta, and ordered the polenta to go with.  The polenta with the sourdough was soooo good!    The cauliflower appetizer was delicious...don't skip it!  I had the porchetta and really could have licked the plate clean.  Finally, the butterscotch budino was a perfect ending....I could have eaten 5 more. I cannot wait to go back and try everything on the menu eventually."}
{"text":"Tried out Esthers, a new hotspot in Vegas. Superbly excellent Italian cuisine. Can't believe they have only been open for five weeks very seasoned staff and operation! The texture of their handmade pasta reminds me of an Italian Mom I never had. The lobster is so fresh my recollection of Chef James' description won't do it justice just killer fresh and we'll leave it at that! Seasoning and sauces on each dish were excellent. The bread it's so good my only comment is pace yourself. It was so good you find yourself having a snaccident on bread and anchovy garlic butter. Ration your bread or bring a third wheel. They are generous on portions but we winged it alone so we had to overeat on the three entrees. The Cauliflower needs no explanation you like cauliflower? Get it. You don't like Cauliflower. Get it. Yup it's that good. Bonus points for the look and feel of the establishment. LEGIT!"}
{"text":"Get the polenta, if you don't order the polenta you're fucking up. One of the best dishes I've ever had!! You can see the Chef and owner in the pass putting the finishing touches on every dish before it goes out to the tables, what a beautiful sight! Finish your dish with the butterscotch budino-hand to god one of the best desserts I've ever put in my mouth. 12/10 recco my friends this spot is a Las Vegas gem!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The vibe is A+ and all of the dishes are A+++. Pasta is a pastime, and Esther's Kitchen puts out the HEAT. Went for a friend's bday & ended up getting the Mushroom Pizza (A1). The sourdough bread is some of the best I've had. They said the yeast was conceived around the time the restaurant started (don't quote me on this). For dessert, we got the Butterscotch Budino & the Dark Chocolate Tart. $$$. Rounded out the meal perfectly. & Service represented extremely well. Every time I'm in Vegas, this will always be an option. Great work guys."}
{"text":"Amazing lunch!  I have been wanting to lunch here since I drove by a couple of weeks ago.  Why did I wait so long!  We arrived at 11:30 to beat the crowd and were immediately greeted.  You order and pay at the counter first.  The four of us wanted to share so we ordered cauliflower kale salad, margherita pizza, spaghetti with meatballs, and caesar salad.
Our delicious ice tea was served promptly.  Then the magic began...  The caesar salad was hands down the best I have ever had!  The caesar dressing was garlic briny perfection, served over whole romaine and a decadent pillowy mountain of fresh parmesan.  The kale salad was served with soaked raisins, sounds weird but were a perfect compliment to the cauliflower and, YES, fresh parmesan.  The pasta was housemade and al dente amazing.  I did not try the pizza but my co-workers loved it.  I was drooling over the brick chicken but it is only on the dinner menu.  I will be back to buy the cooks a round of beers.
This will be on my list for company to showcase DTLV!"}
{"text":"My new spot for great cocktails and even better food.
The garlic poached tuna salad is outstanding - a must try.
Freshly made pasta and home made bread is delicious. Be careful to not overeat on the bread, you'll miss out on mains! Can't wait to be back
Service is amazing, thanks guys for a great evening."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant and this place is good.
Love having a amazing local gem like this town!
Menu was very perfect, each dish was cool.
The best caesars salad I have ever had."}
{"text":"If i could give them more stars,I would. Food is absolutely amazing, drinks and wine list are outstanding and unbelievably affordable. Service is great, the hostess was super friendly and knowledgeable. The chef did and absolutely beautiful job with the menu and execution of every item on the menu. Atmosphere is cosy and intimate,definitely one of the spots in Vegas. Make sure to try the butter scotch pudding,its to die for."}
{"text":"Handmade pasta, expansive wine selection, and friendly service, make this restaurant a stand out choice for Italian cuisine.  Both of our dishes tasted fresh and flavorful and were appropriate portion sizes.  The wine we paired with it was great and wasn't too expensive.  Overall I would dine here again."}
{"text":"This is a quaint little hide out in the Arts District of Las Vegas. It's artsy decor fits right in with the ambiance of the area. We ordered a variety of dishes to share but my favorite was the scrumptious Chicken Caesar salad. They literally dress each individual romaine leaf with awesomeness. The roasted cauliflower salad was great too. Be sure to ask about the story of Esher I will be dining there again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!   The people, views, food, and drinks!  Oh and even the music.  Love the vibe and flavors all around!"}
{"text":"Best preparation of branzino I have had. Idk how they got the skin so crispy and kept the fish perfectly moist and delicious. And the bread w anchovy butter!! Once again I've not had it's equal. I traditionally do not like sourdough but this bread is so well balanced with tender crum and an almost miche- like dark crisp crust. It's crazy good. If your looking for \"Italian American\" specialities like chicken Parmesan your at the wrong restaurant. James Trees and his staff are not traditionalists. Your going to experience new and creative offerings unlike anything in Las Vegas. Very cool place with a very progressive beverage program. I'm praying more restaurants like this open off strip."}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's Day and was very fortunate to grab a table for two. Love the low key industrial vibe that seems to be steez around Main. Not too big, but looks like they opened up the patio which is nice. Tried the Rigatoni Carbonara that had a nice/rich sauce; tasted exactly what I was expecting with a nice filling portion, but what stood out to me was the Bacon and Egg pizza. Making the bread in house, plus adding the top notch ingredients they use, including an egg on top, equals food heaven. Service was great even on this busy night, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic edition to Vegas as a whole. But even better that it in the Arts District. Every thing from the pasta to the cocktails were perfect!"}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to make it in here Saturday night with a reservation at 7:30pm, prime time for the dinner crowds at heart. In a pocket corner close to Casino Center Blvd, the space was cozy with inspirational quotes, warm woods complete with a neon sign reading Esther's Kitchen, and served as a hot bed for locals including a surprise sighting of Steve Sisolak at the bar. 

I called ahead to confirm a corkage fee to bring along our favorite bottle of Chianti to accompany our meal experience that awaited us shortly thereafter. Patrick waited on us and was well versed in giving us the history of the restaurant and helped us navigate through the top seasonal choices of the menu. As a four-top we committed to sharing everything - zucca flowers, meat board, cacio de pepe, carbonara, polenta with mushrooms, and the porchetta. Chef touched our table twice to ensure everything that came out was to our liking and as a courtesy sent out the most perfect gnudis in a spring pesto sauce and red and yellow beets. It was such an impressive surprise in flavors we could've ordered two more plates of it. Save room for the budino, it does not disappoint! 

This restaurant deserves to be on your must-do list and could very well snag every Best of 2018 award. Please support local business and Chef James Trees and team who's M.O. proudly is listed behind the bar that reads \"strive to get better everyday.\" Well done E.K. Team!"}
{"text":"This place is an amazing addition to the arts district downtown and Las Vegas as a whole. The food is amazing. Do not skip the bread and butters, they are out of this world and I crave them often. The pastas are all made fresh in house. Just amazing ingredients and stuff that you just have a hard time finding at the typical Italian restaurants around town. The decor is fresh and beautiful and it is a new gem in the downtown area. You will not be disappointed. Can not wait to try every single dish on the menu. Love that cauliflower"}
{"text":"Wow! What a great meal!! I was briefly turned off by our waiter who I felt was a little snotty to me, but he was also swamped and ok, whatever, it was fine in the end. The other servers who delivered food to our table all seemed very nice. My friend chose this place and I was wanting more traditional Italian food so I wasn't that excited about eating here, aside from the cool vibe/decor, but dang, the food was excellent. We started with the Caesar salad, which was overdressed but realllly good. The dressing was a bit heavy on the anchovy flavor, so just know that. We also got the bread service with burratta spread and I would come back just to get that. Holy moly. I got Mary's Chicken as my entree, and it was interesting/different but excellent. It had a golden crispy salty skin and sauces that complemented it wonderfully. The other 3 people in my group all raved about it too. The restaurant is small but very popular and is probably very loud at all times. We were able to converse ok, but don't come here if you're looking for a quiet meal. We ended our dinner with pannacotta. I don't remember the exact description, the server just rattles them all off to you, but I think it was buttermilk pannacotta with strawberries, basil and maybe rhubarb. It's more like a slightly runny yogurt than a pannacotta, but if the texture doesn't get to you too bad, the flavors were incredible! Really impressed with this place, I highly recommend it--if you can handle the loudness."}
{"text":"Love this spot! So happy to have a new addition in the arts district walking distance to home. The pasta is made fresh in house, and they have a really impressive array of hard to find spirits behind the bar. The food and drink is done right at this place 100%! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Amazing food & great service! Went with a large group on a busy Saturday pm, staff was friendly, knowledgeable about menu & made excellent recommendations. Don't skip on desert!!!"}
{"text":"Just had an amazing dinner experience with a group of 9, which they were easily able to accommodate. Welcome to the neighborhood!
The menu was created by the chef owner, inspired by his late grandmother (Esther). Impressive bar selection, great beer list (never seen Monk's Flemish Ale in Vegas!). Food was really great Italian food, having trouble remembering names of dishes but pasta was cooked al dente and full of flavor and pizza with bacon and quail egg was divine. Waiter told us the chef was a \"butterscotch specialist,\" so naturally you can't say no to a taste. It did not disappoint, and panna cotta with huckleberries and basil syrup was great! A+ new addiction to dtlv, welcome! Can't wait to see the back patio when that opens soon."}
{"text":"In the glitz and glamour of Vegas, it is refreshing to find a place like Esther's serving an honest, high quality meal at a competitive price point

Our meal consisted of the sour dough, charcuterie board, pizza of the day, 2 entree pastas, porchetta and the butterscotch budino

All told, I know we could have easily spent twice the amount on the Strip for the same meal

Service was evenly paced and the quality of the final product speaks for itself.  On a side note, the staff is engaging and it is wonderful to see chef Trees at the helm as expeditor finishing plates before they hit the floor

The North end of Las Vegas is really coming into its own - if you have the chance, get out and explore!

Support the local privateers like Trees and his team at Esther's!"}
{"text":"Best Italian food in Vegas by a landslide one of the best I've had across the country"}
{"text":"This place is a winner! From the food to the decor to the ambience, this is just a great place.  It's lively, nice and delicious.  I definitely recommend making reservations.  I arrived at 7:30 with reservations, the place was half-full and within 15 minutes there was a wait, so definitely make them if you can.  On to the food... 

Ever taste something so good you giggle a little?  That was the cauliflower.  I almost ordered bread to sop up the leftover oil and fried capers.  How do they say, it's \"lick your plate clean\" good?  Light breading, super crisp, soft in the middle and a pure flavor explosion!  The fried capers are a great touch.  

Me and my girlfriend shared two pasta dishes(the pasta is made fresh there); Cacio E Pepe and the Rigatoni Carbonara.  I didn't post pictures because there's plenty of them on here of both.  Cacio has always been one of my favorite pasta dishes because how simple and flavorful it is.  Main flavors are parmesan and fresh black pepper.  

The Carbonara was outstanding.  Carbonara has always been one of those pasta dishes that you can easily mess up, but they do right.  You can really taste all the ingredients down to the egg yolk,, but for me it was the guanciale that really sets this dish off; salty, smokey and super crisp.  

For dessert we had the panna cotta.  This was a super inventive version of panna cotta.  Fresh strawberries, cubes of pistachio cake, rhubarb and little dollops of some kind of basil oil.  I don't know if it was an oil or some kind of extract, but it was a great contrast to the sweet and creamy flavors. 

Can't say enough good things about this place.  I will definitely be back to try some more dishes.  It is a lively dining experience, a bit loud, but I enjoyed that.  I even loved the dishes they use.  The place is artsy meets rustic.

The service was also good.  I can't remember his name, but he was very friendly, attentive and was enthusiastic about the food which really helps with the experience."}
{"text":"I booked a reservation on open table which you HAVE to do. It is small inside so the noise level gets kinda high, so if you are looking for a place where you can have a full on conversation I don't really recommend this place. 

But the waiter, Patrick was amazing! Very knowledge experience in the menu. 

Beer is five bucks which I was happy about. And the food is amazing. All home cooked pasta, and I recommend starting out with the bread for 4$!

Definitely a great addition to the downtown area."}
{"text":"I would give 10stars!!! I took my boyfriend here for his 45th bday and we were blown away at the quality of the food and how amazing everything tasted. And then to top it off the chef/owner came to the table to see how we liked everything!! 2 thumbs up for the food and the hospitality of this restaurant. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely everything I thought it was going to be and more! You MUST get the Butterscotch Pudding. It was my treat for the night and, if it was socially acceptable, I would have licked the entire cup it was in!! Chopped salad is enough of a meal in itself. Cavatelli was to die for. I love finding new places that are actually good! Also, the service was impeccable. Great job, Chef Trees!"}
{"text":"Bring from out of town, this was definitely four stars or Plus, waiter gave us good choices to pick from. Would definitely come back here Berry Bear"}
{"text":"Wow! Excellent! Creative dishes with exceptional flavor combinations. Visited with a group of 8 and everyone was blown away with the food. Chef and his staff are VERY talented. I wpuld eat anything they come up with. Good service too."}
{"text":"This food is exceptional and hands down the best , hottest restaurant in Vegas at the moment. Chef Trees and crew are running like a well oiled machine having only been open a few weeks. Their sour dough pizza is amazing.Their handmade pastas are delicious. The desserts and cocktails are second to none. The hostesses , wait staff , bartenders and kitchen staff are all superb. To say they are anything less is a complete insult to this great group of people. I personally think James K is a troll , spreading lies and possibly owns some Olive Garden knock off as he has zero clue about what he's talking about. This is why I can't stand Yelp."}
{"text":"\"You can't sit here...\"

After confirming business hours via Yelp my favorite unfiltered dame and I stopped by Esther's for some  grub around 4:30pm. The bartender was pretty uninviting attempting to persuade us to sit at the bar because the dining room allegedly wasn't available for thirty minutes. After a short debate we were seated at a table nearest the bar. Overall service 2/5 

The food however is without a doubt delicious af! We were extremely pleased with the menu and will certainly be back with hopes of welcoming, efficient service.

White Pie $16 Truffle cheese garlic panna, mushroom, cauliflower & white asparagus. The crust alone was satisfying to the last bite. The pizza is by far one of the better pies I've had! 5/5

House ground polenta $15 great presentation and taste great. The \"balsamic\" was not our fave to pair with dish but cleaned the plate! 

Chard Octopus $18 has a bold flavorful taste that I appreciated. Regrettably,  the squid was a tad bit tough to cut through!

Dessert|| The Budino $8 has a lot of potential but definitely needs a chill pill. The liquid like consistency was disappointing but the ingredients made this dish a hit! 

$60+ Tip welcome to DTLV #EstherLV"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy.  I have been here twice now and both times everything was so good.  The staff was super nice and friendly.  The pasta is cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Came in unknowingly about the place a couple of the dishes were amazing but the cocktails were horrible. Not because Im a bartender but because i have a common palate and know when a drink Is good ... i aIso personally asked to add to some sugar in order to make the drink, drinkable. None the less cool place, and would come back again."}
{"text":"Was in town for only a few days and this was one of my luckiest finds. Esther's had only been open a short time but it was a no brained after seeing the food and some of the reviews. 

I had An amazing rigatoni carbonara. The guanciale(pork cheek) added the perfect offset to bring the dish to another level.

Also the staff was superb with the chef coming out to the front of the house with other management meeting the clientele and sharing some kitchen war stories. 

Erin from Uber - Put this at the top of your list."}
{"text":"I'm happy that I found a new Italian food spot! I'm not downtown often but this place kept getting mentioned by friends and clients so I had to check it out! I had a glass of white wine and a glass of prosecco . I came with some friends so we shared the charcuterie board. I was pleasantly surprised by the fois gras, Nice selection on pickled veggies, meat and cheese. I knew before arriving that I would have the carbonara for my entree by all the yelp pictures! It was delicious! The chef came to our Table and checked in on us. He was so friendly made us feel like he was cooking for friends. We opted for all 3 desserts. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The wife and I went to dinner at Esther's Kitchen on a Wednesday night.  We both love Italian food and Esther's Kitchen came highly recommended to us by the chef at Sparrow + Wolf.  We certainly couldn't ignore the word of a talented chef at a restaurant we'd just dined at and loved.  Even though it was a Wednesday night a little after 6PM, the dining room was packed and most of the seats at the bar were taken.  Thankfully, we had dinner reservations and were seated immediately.

We ordered a couple of appetizers to share, the Ricotta Gnudi ($15) and the Polpette (meatballs) ($11).  As I learned, the name of the dish \"Ricotta Gnudi\" is actually a bit redundant since gnudi by definition is a gnocchi-like dumpling made with ricotta.  Regardless of its name or definition   They were fluffy, light, ricotta pillows complimented nicely by beets and pistachio pesto.  The polpette were moist, juicy, and flavorful and served with a piquant red sauce.  For my entrée, I had the Bucatini alla Amatriciana ($16).  We were informed that all of the pasta was made fresh in house.  My bucatini, a pasta style that I had not previously tried, definitely had that taste and mouth feel of fresh pasta.  It was paired with a nicely seasoned, spicy, red sauce.  My dish was absolutely delicious.  For dessert, we shared a Budino (butterscotch pudding) ($8) and a glass of amaro ($9).  It was a sweet, but not overly sweet, ending to our meal.  Service was exceptional as we were made to feel like guests in someone's home.  Esther's Kitchen offered outstanding quality, new (for me) Italian food experiences, and value.  It was the most pleasant surprise of our time in Vegas.  For locals and tourists, Esther's Kitchen is definitely worth a trip out to the Arts District."}
{"text":"Amazing. All of my friends need to get down here. Seriously great food leveraging local providers. I will be back."}
{"text":"Thank you, James (chef) for a wonderful night. Hard to put to words the flavors we tasted tonight. Explore the menu and order everything. Come back and do it again. 

I had the Lasagnetta Nero - tomato, squid ink pasta, truffle and fennel. The crispy sausage, beet salad, carbonara, and on and on. My advice: make a reservation before the rest of Vegas discovers this place - which I hope they do. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. This place is hopping and rightfully so, the food was all so delicious with unexpected layers of flavor. Be prepared for a wait during prime time, but it is totally worth it. Several dishes were tried and loved by all. The portions were nicely sized, but not so huge that you couldn't share a fabulous dessert. They also have a nice wine selection and extra attentive service. This was a hit with everyone I talked to and I'm already planning when I can go again."}
{"text":"If you are reading this.. stop.. get into a lyft (because their wine and cocktail program is amazing and you'll be drinking more then you planned)and get to this amazing place.

I know the chef. And I know a lot of people would make up an amazing yelp review even if the food was mediocre. But that's not me. I'm always nervous when I step into a friends new restaurant. You have to clear the plate to not offend and over praise them if the food is bland and under seasoned..But that's not the relationship I've ever had with James Trees, the chef/owner. I tell it like it is.. sooooo here's the truth

The place is beautiful. A place where you feel comfortable walking in dressed up or dressed in your everyday jeans and t shirt. The staff doesn't feel intimidating nor awkward. You feel the heart, the family that they have become.The wine list is affordable and the cocktails have the right amount of uniqueness

Fresh made pasta DONE RIGHT! My god it's such a risk. And he nailed it. I couldn't be prouder. I had the rigatoni carbonara, and it was seasoned and cooked perfect. Little gem salad, up until now i thought my fiancé made the best Caesar style dressing , nope that award now goes to the guys in this kitchen.. and the fish.... just get it.. no matter what it is that day just get it. It was red something or other and it was flakey and citrusy and on top of black lentils and fennel.. And then get dessert and make sure you get two. Trust me, a stranger, but a stranger that knows food. Good job everyone! If work permits i will be back this week!"}
{"text":"Fantastic.... simple flavors done extremely well. Great service, fun environment, extremely attractive menu. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Ahhh Roma...

If you've been, you understand.  A jovial dining room filled with guests enjoying simple but incredible food that speaks to tradition.  Homemade pastas, sauces, dishes that come from passion and love.  Esther's kitchen has it.  The trick, you need to know what to order.

Tip:  Bread is for mopping up left over pasta sauces (not to smear with butter or dunk in olive oil ahead of your meal).

Tip:  Pastas are NOT side dishes and should be eaten by themselves.

1.  Cacio e pepe -  1/3 classic Roman pastas.  Steaming hot, very al dente, handmade pasta, a bit of starchy cooking water, a copious amount of pecorino cheese and a load of fresh cracked pepper.  Sounds simple; it is and wow is it sublime.  Liquefied essence of aged pecorino. 

2.  Bucatini all'amatraciana - 2/3 classic Roman pastas.  Bucatini (think spaghetti with a hole in the middle), finished in a sauce of guanciale (cured pork jowls), its rendered fat, onions, a hit of chili flakes, and crushed sweet and acidic tomatoes.   Sublime.

3.  Carbonara - 3/3 classic roman pastas.  This isn't the faux carbonara made with cream and filled with \"stuff\"  rather house made rigatoni tossed with guancale and its rendered fat, raw egg yolks and a handful of grana padano (hard cow's milk cheese from Emilia Romagna).  The residual heat of the pasta melts the cheese and partially cooks the egg yolk.  While the cheese isn't Roman, the resulting product taste correct; eggy, porky goodness.

Need meat?  If available, order the prochetta.  Think of a rolled up boneless pig roast.  Crispy skin on the outside, soft, tender, juicy pork on the inside.  Another roman classic that beckons you to pull it apart with your fingers and devour it while sipping a negroni. 

Simple wine program.  Food friendly offerings.  Some amaro (required digestif), and they do make a good negroni.  Great HH.  16:00 - 18:00 daily. All wines by the glass $5, $4 beer, $9 signature cocktails.

Service is a work in progress.  It will improve with time.

Who would have guessed, Roma in the arts district of a a Western US desert city?

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've been to Esther's 10 times since it opened.  My review is based upon a variety of experiences, both at the bar and seated in the dining room.

First of all, the staff is amazing.  They are friendly, helpful and the service has been great on each of my visits.  Management clearly understands the value of service and IT SHOWS!  

Next, the food is awesome.  Out of 10 meals, I've had one that I didn't enjoy (it was well-prepared, I just didn't like the flavors).  The others have been absolute home runs.  The Brick Chicken is amazing.  The Bacon, Carmelized Onion pizza is phenomenal.  There is always a fresh fish, which is prepared beautifully.  I had spaghetti with meatballs recently that blew my mind.  The chef focuses on quality ingredients and it shows.  And everything tastes so incredibly fresh.

I highly recommend Esther's.  The consistent crowds are proof-positive that they are doing something exceptional in the Arts District!

PS - A special shout-out to David at the bar, who always greets me with a smile and a handshake.  A true professional..."}
{"text":"I love this place. Basically the concept here the food is made in house from scratch. Trust me you can taste the difference. You can see the loaves of fresh bread in the kitchen window. My pasta  dish was divine, also there lovely potato chips. Honestly some of the best pasta in my life. You simply cannot go wrong from ordering anything off the menu. The ambiance is nice, and the staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"New hot spot Downtown, delivering on some well executed, complex dishes....yet stumbling on others.

Go for the Lasagnetta Nero : Lobster, Fennel, Lemon & Truffle.  Generous portion of lobster, well done and balanced dish!

And be sure to finish with the Butterscotch Budino : Scotch Caramel, Whipped Cream & Honeycomb.  OUTSTANDING, one of the best desserts I've had for a while!  Strong, boozey flavor with the right combination of sweet ;)

Service was friendly yet slow.  A cocktail was refused to the server, and was replaced, yet the refused sat on the table for the rest of the night.  When the bill came, it was still lingering.

With a bit of time and execution, Esther's Kitchen may give you an additional reason to visit the Arts District more and more ;)"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was good. The vibe was chill and not pretentious. Everyone on staff was attentive and very pleasant. I had the sour dough bread with burrata, Lasagnetto (with lobster)... it was excellent. I'll head back with friends and family in tow."}
{"text":"I don't even have words. This was a truly exceptional dinner with an exceptional atmosphere and exceptional service.

We were a party of 5 and went for a more family style meal and ordered about half of the menu. Everything was incredible! We were especially excited about the lobster lasagnette, squid ink pasta -- it was phenomenal. Really some of the best pasta I have had. We also got the charcuterie, white pizza, arugula salad, branzino, pomadoro pasta, paparedelle and beets. I think we probably got something else too but I can't remember at this point! The items that really stood out were the beets, white pizza, and lasagnette.

There were a ton of people on staff and they were super attentive. The chef was meticulous in making sure everything was up to standard from all angles, he came out into the dining room twice while we were there and we talked to him for a bit. It was easy to see how passionate and proud he was of his food.

I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone going to Vegas. Even if you are trying to stay on the strip, this is well worth the trip."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and well presented! (Try the lentils and lobster lasagna!) The service was amazing and our server was super knowledgable about the drink and food menu. Drinks were also amazing and unique and very inexpensive. The entire dinner was extremely reasonable for the taste, service, and overall experience. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"So happy to see the team cranking out great food and drinks at Esther's.  Every dish we had was awesome, the house bread and buratta, all of the house made pastas, and the porchetta!  Congrats to Chef James and company!"}
{"text":"The hype behind this place is real. My friends and I started off with ordering some bread with the basil oil and what seemed like a really thick cheese that really took to the bread perfectly. Also the very juicy meatballs with basil ricotta, and the meat and cheese plate that had liver patte and stinky cheese. I mention those because I've never tried them and they were really good. Different but good. It didn't last long amongst five people. As we went to order our entrees the chef saw that our table was empty and sent us another bread on the house. Well worth the carb overload. After that we ordered our main dishes. Everyone got something different so we could really try most the menu.  And the portions however misleading in pictures are actually a good size. The lobster with squid ink pasta gives a generous amount of lobster which is rare in most restaurants. As for the pasta, it's all made in house and was my initial reason for wanting to go. Last but not least was the dessert. The panna cotta was full of different flavors that paired nicely leaving a lightly sweetened taste in you mouth. Nothing ordered was less than amazing. The staff was great here as well. From the door to the table and even the kitchen. Everyone was really working as a team. Our server(s) were very knowledgeable and would suggest how to eat the meat and cheese plate which helped with the stinky cheeses for sure. Also the head chef made his way around and introduced himself to the tables which is always a nice touch especially in a restaurant so busy. This place is 5 out 5 in my book."}
{"text":"Now open for three months and still doing big numbers in The Arts District it was with family in town that a half-day at work allowed four to sit down at Esther's Kitchen for Lunch, the dining room bathed in sunlight and counter-style ordering offering a very different vibe than dinner but the Food continuing to tell of a Restaurant willing to go the extra mile to make sure everything lives up a high standard.

Chugging along with a full reservation book each evening, a good problem to have but one that can certainly be draining on a close-knit crew running 10 services weekly and making most everything from scratch, those arriving at 1130 S Casino Center Boulevard during daylight hours Tuesday through Friday will find themselves greeted at the door where menus are available, orders and payment taken up-front with a playing card handed out to alert an attentive yet abbreviated staff where to deliver each plate as it is fired.

Busy but not hectic at Lunch, the menu cutting back on Pastas, Appetizers and Entrees with Salads and Sandwiches served in their place, it was with Chef Trees busy in the kitchen and Baker Dylan making fresh Pasta in the prep room that six dishes were ordered in addition to one Dessert, the soundtrack overhead once again delighting with the likes of Led Zeppelin though the tempo and volume of song selections was slower and lower than at night.

Dining with one repeat customer plus two first-timers, the desire to order only novel items compromised slightly for the later, it was perhaps ten minutes after taking a seat that plates began to emerge from the kitchen, a Chicken Parm Sandwich quickly announcing that Chef Trees wasn't about to mail it in just because something can be found cheap at almost any 24/7 bar in town, the crispy fried Bird itself a fine rendition with light spicing but the real star a topping of Whipped Burrata and bright Tomato Sauce plus the toasty housemade Roll.

Sold out of Radiatorre after another busy night, the Lunch menu's only exclusive Pasta thus offered instead with Rigatoni, suffice it to say that those looking for something unique would be well-advised to invest $12 in a plate of Noodles topped in Lemon Cream and Garlic plus toasted Breadcrumbs, the Citrus adding levity one certainly won't find in Trees' textbook Carbonara though another good choice for those looking for something light is Esther's simple yet stunning Spaghetti available with or without two well-seasoned Meatballs.

Waiting a few extra minutes for the rest, a flooded four-top soon to be a reward for ordering too much for most, those who've not had an opportunity to taste Esther's limited-run Porchetta may wish to consider lunch as a good time to taste the same Meat in a more accessible format, the Roast Pork topped with crispy Skin and Bitter Rabe as good a Sandwich as one will find anywhere in DTLV while the Margherita Pizza represents another case of simple done right with good Mozz and crushed Tomatoes on housemade Sourdough Crust.

Further impressed by Taro and Sweet Potato Chips served with the Sandwiches, a few oily specimens only worth mentioning because everything else was so pristine, a lone \"flaw\" of counter-style ordering is that those unaware of Esther's unlisted Dessert Menu may miss out on the Butterscotch Budino loaded with Butter and deglazed with Scotch and that would be a damned shame because it puts other versions in Las Vegas to shame at a price that is a few bucks lower.

*****A 'surprise' sensation regardless of James Trees, his talent never in question but the likelihood of Las Vegans seeing the value in $15 plates of handmade Pasta originally worrisome given long-lines at Olive Garden and Cheesecake Factory every day of the week, Esther's Kitchen may just be what The Arts District has been lacking all along and that is a Restaurant where the owner put his passion, skill and money on the line to do something personal and genuine."}
{"text":"One of the things I fell in love with dining out was the intimacy? of fine dining, I am seeing a return to? more intimate? dining rooms in a less formal atmosphere. Esther's Kitchen? is an amazing room, the design is warm and inviting while maintaining a? sense of style and self. The food, OMG, the flavors are the kind of flavor profiles you would expect of a Michelin star restaurant?, James Trees is an artist ?while making amazing? food he also makes it available to all. The service was great while the restaurant? was new the professionalism is top notch. This is the type of restaurant?  that you make memories at and it becomes a romantic place to create dreams."}
{"text":"I've been to Esther's Kitchen for lunch and was looking forward to taking my family for dinner.  We were in the area and arrived to the restaurant at 4:40pm.  The hostess Heather was rude from the beginning and asked us if we had a reservation, I told her we didn't and she said she didn't have any tables available, even though most of the restaurant was empty.  She wanted to sit our party of 5 outside where you can only fit 3 people.  My family and I were not made to feel welcomed and it all began with the hostess Heather.  I can't believe she's the one greeting customers.  My family and I ended up leaving."}
{"text":"I haven't had a life-changing-OMG-this-pasta-blows-my-mind moment since  2011. Pasta-induced foodgasms have been missing from my life until I went here.

Parking wasn't bad for being in Downtown LV. The place was packed so do make reservations. It felt like California, Portland and IKEA in one place - 2/3 of those places I do like.

Uni Toast:
Crusty bread grilled to that perfect crunch. The layers of flavor and different textures in your mouth are what makes this APPealing. The celery root balances the flavor of the uni. 4/5

Chitarra Cacio e Pepe:
This was what brought me here in the first place. Pasta with 2 basic ingredients: cheese and pepper. So simple, yet so satisfyingly delicious. Think mac and cheese for adults. No protein in this dish, just pure glory of carbs (and fat). Strings of melts cheese for every twist and pull of that fork. 5/5

Lasagnetta Nero:
Squid ink lasagnette in tomato, lemon and truffle sauce with lobster and fennel. This is a beautiful dish with vibrant colors and flavors just the same. Pretty generous with the lobster. If you like fresh flavors with a bit of tartness - this is for you. 5/5

Butterscotch Budino:
 Rich and thick budino with caramel on top sprinkled with honeycomb for a nice crunch. 4/5

I found myself forking back and forth between two noodles. I just couldn't decide which one I liked more: the simple one or the one with all the pizazz."}
{"text":"Not the most convenient location for a visit when staying on the strip. But, certainly worth the effort. Not a huge menu, but you can appreciate the how good everything is.

The Cauliflower dish was the best I've ever had- and I eat a lot of cauliflower!

And, Juan is on my short list of best waiters of all time."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night for a quick bite. Had the meatball appetizer and ordered two pastas for myself. Wanted to try both and was going to take the remainder home. Cavatelli and Rigatoni. Absolutely PERFECT!!!. Chef James called me over and asked what I was reading as I was sitting there alone reading a magazine. Asked if I wanted a shot. Although I do not drink I was impressed with his outgoing nature and felt like a \"regular\". What a class act!!! Chef also told me that next time I could sit at the bar and they would make mock (no alcohol) cocktails to further my experience. This food was off-the-hook. Excellent and I cannot wait to go back and try a couple of new items. Also, told some friends/associates and they will be joining me next time. By the way, the prices were extremely fair considering the finest quality of the ingredients that Chef James uses."}
{"text":"So happyyyyyy we tried this place!

You know the food is good when you forget to take pictures of everything!! It's soooo rare to have an amazing meal like back-to-back. Literally when was the last time you had a meal where EVERY dish was good.

I could start off with every dish saying \"Oh I'm not a ____ person, but Esther's was the bomb\" but that's basically how it went down. The mushrooms, cauliflower, the bread and butter (a dangerous necessity), herb fettuccine, squash and scallop agnolotti. Best Caesar salad I've ever tried in this city and I was exited from the womb with a Caesar salad in hand. Literally had to be rolled out of the restaurant in a wheelbarrow.

Make a reservation!! They're on OpenTable too but it's a necessity. Plus all the red wine (ALL) is $10 a glass and $36 a bottle, I think white is cheaper. ALLA THEM. Plus the owner/manager/someone came over and talked to us multiple times and he was an absolute sweetheart. Absolute amazing addition to the hood."}
{"text":"Great place! The food is simple, a tad neuvo Italian and very tasty. We started with their chopped salad, fresh and had their crunchy bread, fabulous. My wife got a deconstructed lasagnette, made up of long narrow pasta with black ink and fennel. I had the herbed spinach  fettuccine with clams both very good. The pastas are freshly made, a plus and no excuse for any Italian resturant not to serve fresh pasta! The service was prompt, courteous and excellent. The wine list is very good and priced well. The noise level is high and the seating pretty close."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best pasta I have ever had!! Fresh pasta is definitely better than store bought. Great vibe, love that the kitchen is open. Would highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Chef reached out to us and came in again. Food was very good like the first time. Music still loud but food great."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great Service! Lots of wonderful vegetable plates for sharing. The spaghetti square is fantastic. For the main course, the Mary's chickens so juicy and flavorful. I highly recommend it. Great prices on wine too. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Everything tasted amazing, much better than I expected and the pricing was the icing on the cake. You will probably spend about $40 per person and the quality of the food makes that a steal. I will definitely be coming back regularly. Even if you're not in the area it is 100% worth the trip."}
{"text":"This is an awesome hiddent spot near old Vegas. Top tier food, excellent service, and super reasonably priced. If you're staying on strip, it's worth the Uber to come up here."}
{"text":"Wow! What a treat. We were told we were headed to a bad part of town but this is an up and coming area. Drinks, food and service were outstanding. Very special and unique dishes I wish I could make but seem way too complicated for me. We'll be back. I dined with 5 others and we all agreed on the 5 rating."}
{"text":"You can feel the love and dedication in every bite. This restaurant didn't any details. My table shared: 

Marg Pizza- Crispy, not burnt crust.
                       Melted, not broken mozz.

Bread Service w/burrata. Delicious, made in house. 

Rigatoni Carbonara- creamy sauce, crispy guanciale, fresh pasta

Charcuterie Board - to much to explain, but all beautiful. This one is a must. 

Delicious cocktails. I recommend there nigroni."}
{"text":"Delicious delicious delicious! 

We spent a few days as tourists in Las Vegas and got many tips and recommendations from foodie friends, Esther's Kitchen was by far our favorite meal of the trip (maybe our favorite meal of the year?). If you want details keep reading, otherwise just go and enjoy ;)

Atmosphere: We were a group of 4 adults and 2 toddlers and we were seated under the misters on the back patio, where it was nice and shaded and the little ones could walk around a bit since currently there is just one large table back there (awesome - that meant a relaxed meal for the adults and no rushing). Staff checked in with us at least every 15 minutes, bringing tons of water and were very sweet to the kiddos (and Vegas dining usually isn't 'kid friendly', so I was over the moon). Everyone chatted with us quite a bit - even gave us excellent tips for brunch the next day. Nothing makes a vacation feel more like a vacation than personal and friendly attention over a relaxed dinner. 

Food: We started with anchovy garlic butter and burrata with bread. Pretty much universal consensus this was going to be the highlight. Then the ricotta gnudi arrived, which we thought was going to be the real highlight (perfectly tender-and-chewy pasta with a melty creamy filling, beautiful beets). There was a seasonal salad with the ripest nectarines and a basil/lemony dark green leaf in it dressed with balsamic that was a perfect break from the bready start, just in time to prepare us for the squid ink infused pasta that proved you can go from \"this is the best\" to \"this is even better\". We served the small ones crispy cauliflower (think tempura done exactly right) and margarita pizza (also, perfection).  

Cocktails: We asked the staff to make recommendations and had three rounds (hey, it was vacation). I actually was drinking non-alcoholic mock-tails, and while typically a mocktail is nothing to write home about - these were special! I had something with a bit of the house-made sage syrup that was refreshing, and a muddled grapefruit and mint sparkling drink that I will be attempting to recreate for the rest of the summer. My husband requested \"something smokey\" which was delivered with bourbon, and he had \"something with gin\", which he says was the ideal summer drink. I can't recall what else was imbibed but we all would return for an extended cocktail hour, maybe without children, any time!

Neighborhood: I knew nothing about the Vegas 'arts district' - this is definitely the up-and-coming hipster neighborhood. Would love to see what else is happening here in the coming months, it's great to see a side of Vegas that is neither the strip nor surburban."}
{"text":"I know I've been slacking on leaving reviews. But Esther's definitely has something to talk about. 

I have been wanting to find a Italian kitchen like this that isn't in the strip. 

Esther's definitely pumps out some tasty a$$ food!! 

Their pastas are extruded/ hand made. They use no more than 3/4 ingredients which means the pasta will talk for its self. 

I love that the place is small and open you can see the cooks kickin ass back there. 

Their cocktails and wine are  you won't be disappointed. I always go with the super Tuscan and the cacio e pepe. 

Thank you guys i will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Let's start off with ambiance of the restaurant. It's so comfortable that we even shared food with a complete stranger. (His name was Vladimir). Then greeted  by a very friendly well talented San Francisco mixologist named Sonia. The wine and food list was exceptional. The homemade bread is fantastic, our first pick was mushroom dish with corn polenta which has to be my favorite dish. (Dip the bread in it. Promise it won't let you down). Second was the the parsnip risotto, the lemon zest exploded in your mouth. Followed by the meatballs the squash and scallops( that melted in your mouth).  Chef James comes out to greet every table to make sure your food was as good as your experience. It was my second time there and I can't wait to try the lunch menu."}
{"text":"First and foremost, our server and the staff were amazing. That in and of itself is why I'm giving three stars instead of two. We were running about 10 minutes late for our reservation and they still honored it when we called, which was excellent. After we got there, we realized that the wait for food was going to be substantial because the kitchen was hopping. We told our server that we had a 7:30 pm show and he was more than accommodating. We got our food on time and out the door in time to make our show. 

Additionally, the decor is eclectic and lovely. It's certainly a nice aesthetic, but the atmosphere leaves a lot to be desired. The music was incredibly loud and everyone was talking over it. Because everyone was talking over the loud music and the tables are close together, we got to hear basically the entirety of the conversation between two ladies next to us and had a very difficult time conversing ourselves. We eventually gave up. Mercifully, the food came out about 25 minutes later (we both ordered pasta dishes to speed the process) and we were completely underwhelmed. 

I wasn't expecting anything to taste like I stepped through a portal to Florence, Italy, but for the hype and the price, I expected that in my lasagnette nero, the lobster wouldn't be so overcooked and chewy. The sauce wasn't terribly flavorful unless you like fennel paste with a dash of lemon. None of it tasted quite right. The nero noodles were heavy and rubbery. My husband's cavatelli was overly sweet and honestly pretty bland. We had such high expectations of the food and walked away disappointed. 

Again, it's a charming place and the service was excellent. If we try again, we'll opt for something completely different off the menu. I'm happy that Vegas is getting more restaurants with character, especially downtown, but the food left me underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Horrible Attentiveness: 
A 2 year local to Las Vegas, I brought two of my visiting friends who wanted to dine off the strip on a Saturday night at the end of May. The restaurant was busy for any good joint on a weekend night. 

I arrived and waited about a minute for the hostess after we entered. A couple arrives behind our group, the hostess comes up, walks past me and greets the people behind us when we are clearly next in line.

We eventually get seated at the back patio after getting drinks at the bar, the weather was nice and I was looking forward to having a good time with friends I haven't seen in a while. 

We were seated for a couple minutes and someone drops off waters to our table and tells us our server will be with us, soon. Several employees walk by our table numerous times and we are never ever greeted again...for about 15 minutes...while the staff is serving other tables, they even served a table that was seated several minutes after we sat down. I grew very agitated at the absurdity in the lack of service.  At this point, I concluded that our time at Esther's will be downhill from here. I called it a night at Esther's, we got up and walked out...with no one ever once greeting us again. 

We went over to spend our time and money at Carson Kitchen to have dinner where service was a million times more better and the food was amazing. 

I am greatly disappointed I did not get to try Esther's Kitchen, I had been looking forward to dining here since it opened. I am a great supporter of local restaurants but this experience left a bad taste in my mouth. Will I go back? I doubt it, would not want to waste my time or spend my money at a place that gave me horrible service."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant worthy of the hype.  Remember it's north of Charleston and not by the Arts District.  The homemade pasta was the best I have had in town.  The risotto blew my mind.  The little white anchovy ceasar salad.  Bellisimo!  My wife's seafood dish was delicious.  Friendly service.  Great bar.  Cool vibe. A bit noisy but ear plugs and you're fine.  Fresh, high quality ingredients, creative, progressive, and well-presented dishes, all the way from appetizers to desserts, with gr8 wine and beer to uplift you taste and smell buds to a higher level."}
{"text":"So good! Totally exceeded my expectations. I tried as many appetizers and entrees as I could in one sitting and all were excellent! The service was on point and a great atmosphere. Esther's is a must try place don't cheat yourself and miss out on excellence. They seem to fill up fast so definitely have a reservation or the bar looked like a fun time. Top of its class in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Ate dinner at Esther's Kitchen when I was in town!  It was amazing. The food was absolutely delicious. I had the chicken, it was tender, juicy, and flavorful!  We also had the bread and ricotta and the beets...Also delicious. 

I highly recommend this hidden jewel downtown!"}
{"text":"Me and my Gal Pals, came in on a late Friday night. Its in a 5 min. walking distance from the Art Gallery. Apparently, it was crowded and we we could only get seating outside. It was a chilly night, a table opened up, and we requested to be re-seated. And they were able to make it happen. We met the owner, James, and told him that I'm the real Esther. Ha! He said,\"everyone has an Esther.\" His kitchen is named after his Great Aunt E who lived until 96. Cheers to Esther & James and the fantastic local restaurant! It's a small cute Italian local restaurant. Food is Good. Prices fair. And most important, friendly staff."}
{"text":"My first experience at Esther's was amazing.  I mean just stellar, knock your socks off, WOW!  My second, not so much.  I had the opportunity to come back in a give it another go.  Another great experience.  I do have to say that this is probably one of the best food experiences I've had in Vegas, including those hoity toity expensive places on the strip.

Let's talk about the food.  Each time I've been here the food has been exemplary.  You know what's even harder?  Consistency.  I've had the sourdough bread with anchovy garlic butter each time I've come in and every time it's the same amazing flavor that I've come to crave.  I've had every one of the pasta dishes now and I can't tell you which is my favorite because they are ALL that good.  Yes, the house made pasta is the star but they all also have the right ingredients to make a great balance of flavor.  Picking a pasta here is purely personal preference.  

The service is great.  Yes, it may get a little slow when it's busy but I can't think of any other place that this doesn't happen at.  We too had to wait a bit to be seated even though we got there exactly at the time of our reservation but it was very very crowded.  Every seat was taken, as well as at the bar.  

Every server and bartender I've come into contact with here is great.  Knowledgeable, helpful, friendly, not pushy, not too standoffish.  The general manager and the chef/owner both actually work on the floor here (which I love) and they were so gracious.  They made me feel as if my business was important to them.  Not only do they want to feed me tonight, but they want my repeat business and I can now say that I want to give it to them.  Repeatedly.  Indefinitely."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food! 4 stars for the service. 

A friend recommended this place so we met up at 6pm on a Sunday night with reservations. Kind of hard to find as it is not on Casino center drive but a side street. Decent amount of seating and a bar, and open kitchen viewing. It wasn't full when I arrived but it quickly had all tables loaded and a line out the door. Highly recommend reservations.

I had the butternut squash ravioli....the best I've ever had. Fresh, hand made pasta for each order. We split butterscotch pudding for dessert, nice and creamy and not over sweetened. Very good!

I will definitely come back and try more of the menu. Service was pretty good, just one slip up on dessert wines."}
{"text":"I called at 1:25pm on Saturday afternoon to book a reservation for 3 of us. A polite guy answered and took my reservation and said I was all set! When I got to the restaurant with my friends the hostess didn't have my reservations. I showed her the outbound dial on my phone proving I called and told her I spoke to a gentleman. She didn't seem to care and said they didn't have room for us. I was upset because we were being held responsible and turned away after driving across town because someone had made a mistake. I told the hostess the needed to accommodate us and make it right because the mistake was on their end. She finally gave us a table but was not apologetic or understanding. 

First impressions are everything which is why the 3 stars and not 5. The food was outstanding!! Our server was so nice and friendly and gave us some fantastic recommendations. The best thing I ever ate was the cauliflower appetizer I need this in my life daily! Lol 

Overall , I recommend the restaurant and suggest to reconfirm your reservations before arrival."}
{"text":"The pasta is very fresh, and the staff is amazing. The Chef came out to make sure we were enjoying our dishes throughout the dinner. The mulberries on the panacotta was amazing, and the butterscotch pudding was to die for. The polenta with mushrooms, and buratta  was so yummy!!!! The spaghetti and meatballs, traditional, but worth it to order. The porchetta was crispy with a delicious fennel taste. Great non gluten option. Have fun at this new fun eatery in the art district of Vegas."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my new favorite spots downtown. The decor is inviting and the staff is chill. During my entire experience I never felt rushed out and was given permission many times to enjoy myself and order as I was ready. 

The menu is full of all the carbs. House made pastas, pizzas, cocktails galore. We went with a little of everything. Started with a few drinks off their cocktail menu which were crisp and refreshing. Moved onto the meatballs which were hearty and the pesto ricotta which we named \"the green sauce\" stayed on the table until every last drop was soaked in bread. My only issue with the meal was the sourdough bread we ordered with the burrata. The bread was way overdone and I was not a fan. 

The caramelized onion pizza was mouthwatering and he tiny quail eggs were a brilliant touch on each slice... no yolks left behind! The Carbonara was rich and the fresh peas added a nice crunch of texture. I enjoyed a glass of Sauvignon Blanc with the rest of my meal but we skipped dessert.

Don't worry, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I was in town with a colleague and went on the recommendations from Yelp.  We were 15 minutes late for our reservation and they offered to seat us outside in 95 degree heat or eat at the bar.  The hostess and manager were extremely unaccommodating, boarding in rude, combined with the fact that the resturant does not have air conditioning or at least it was not on.  So we decided to sit at the bar and in spite of the bad first and second impressions Sonya was fantastic.  The burrata was ok and the pasta was fine.  
With all of the other options in Vegas I will pass on Esters the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Great service great food good ambiance.  If you are visiting this is a great place for dinner.  Porcetta to die for.  Meat and cheese tray wow. I will be back with friends"}
{"text":"So over a year ago our Favorite restaurant , Glutton closed in Downtown Las Vegas. We thought for sure that no other place would pop up doing home made pastas & breads. What a breath of fresh air Esther's Kitchen is!

We went to Esther's about 2 days ago on a Wednesday and now I'm scratching my head on why we haven't checked out this little gem sooner. We had the 3 different pastas and everyone was delicious. House baked bread & burrata was a perfect start to this carb overload of a dinning experience. totally worth it.   Defiantly check this place out when searching downtown spots as its the best one in a while."}
{"text":"Went two days in a row for dinner because it was so good. They know what they are doing folks. The bread to start is perfection. Highly recommend the peppery pasta (they'll make it vegan for you!), the beets, and the mushrooms."}
{"text":"The location was a little difficult to find, but the food and service made up for it! I went with my co workers and shared most appetizers but ordered our own pasta plate. Everything was delicious!! Definitely worth the try! Drinks are good too!!!"}
{"text":"The best new restaurant in town! Great, comfortable atmosphere, open kitchen, great cocktails and excellent Grub. Take tour time, peruse the menus, try it all!! Be back soon!"}
