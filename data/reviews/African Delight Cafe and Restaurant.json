{"text":"Super delicious food, great prices and very sweet owners. We went in around 10pm and stuffed our faces with the fava bean all-day breakfast, can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"For anyone who walks/drives by wondering what this place is...

Communication in English was difficult. It has a small menu of Eritrean items, and most were not available when I went, so was just generic E. African food. It is a hot table format. Cubed beef was below average; their sweet bread was tasty. In a good neighbourhood. 2.5/5

Still searching for a place where I can find good cooked West African food without risking my life!"}
{"text":"I've tried a couple of other Ethiopian/African Restaurants in Toronto, but this, by far, is my favourite! The food was DELICIOUS, and service was excellent! I'm already looking forward to my next visit here and plan to invite some of my friends to join me! 

Advice: There is something really special about their coffee, ;-)"}
