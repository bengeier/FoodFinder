{"text":"Dera is a relatively new Pakistani restaurant in Parc-Ex. The food is good, we tried the Channa Samosa, Kebab Masala, Biryani and Mutton Karahi and they were good. Their ambiance and decor is very good and the service is fast."}
{"text":"Unhygienic food both me and my-friend had food poisoning, poor service. They will lie to every level to convince you to eat there but believe me it will be your biggest mistake!!
Never think of going at Iftar time 
Owner is rude and a senseless stupid person"}
{"text":"The food is tasty. Much better then Pakistani food served in Mississauga. Very clean and friendly place. It is a place you must try"}
{"text":"Worst Experience twice,
Waitress have high attitude and heard them back bites when an angry customer left.
Use chicken boneless leg meat instead of chicken breast and worst part is the fats on the meat are not cleaned properly. 
Low taste, high charge and they dont care for customer satisfaction.

Just now ordered on phone for 6 naan and after 25 min when I went there to pick up they say we shouldn't have taken this order bcz of rush hour and told me to wait another 10 to 15 minutes.  

Bunch of bad dumb asses don't know how to run a business.
worst experience Don't go there save time and money"}
{"text":"This place merits a four star only and only when you're craving for enormous portions of cheap chicken biryani."}
{"text":"We took the chicken karahi, the paneer with mushrooms and biryani rice and honestly it was soooo delicious. The sauces were amazing. They can make the food mild or spicy according to ur taste. The naan was good too ! They also have takeout specials. Try this pakistani place it's worth the money! And the service was nice and fast."}
{"text":"Dera is by far the most beautiful restaurant in Parc Extension.

The decor is airy and the tables are well laid out, you could hardly tell this used to be a bank. 

The food itself has vastly improved since they first opened, but still not up to par with the heavyweights on Jarry and Jea-Talon Street.

The standout the last time were the Chicken Tikka, succulent breast freshly grilled.
The Lamb Okra was re-heated (oil separated), but still tasty.
We also had a lamb byriani, which was ok,  (We wanted Pulao Rice, but was not on their menu, only saw it on blackboard when leaving).

My Pakistani friend says his people love meat with bones stil on them, most dishes here give you a boneless and non-boneless option. He loved the lamb, I didn't care for it, I would prefer chicken dishes next time.

The service is very distant, lowered gazes, almost no talking or interaction. It's a given here. 

The food used to be much worse (and much cheaper), when they first opened, so this is a restaurant going in the right direction. There are about 5 Pakistani Restaurants in Parc-Ex, and Dera overall seems to be in the lead."}
{"text":"Dera has a great location on St Denis Street. The food was pretty good, I ordered the beef and chicken kabob, rice, naan, and a yogurt drink. The service was quite slow though, which was unfortunate. My friends food came out much sooner than mine, and when mine did come it was not all at once. I hate to give them a 2 star, because I wad really looking foward to the experience, but the service just wasn't there for me on this experience."}
{"text":"Quite un-professional. Did not do a good job of separating checks or explaining their menu. Food is fine."}
{"text":"LOVE the food here ! The butter chicken is so creamy and the naans are so big and fluffy ! The prices are good too. I have had an experience with dirty plates like some of the other people that reviewed this restaurant mentioned."}
{"text":"Attention costumers!

Please disregard any positive reviews concerning this restaurant.  These reviewers have never eaten real Indian foods in their lives.  This is by far one of the worst Indian restaurants in the world. Every dish that I ordered was warm or cold. The butter chicken was bland and the naan bread was hard.  None of the dishes tasted good at all. It is also a very dirty restaurant.  They use the same cart to bring out food and to put dirty dishes on.  Maison Indian Curry House is by far the best indian restaurant in Montreal.

By the way they don't serve alcohol and you cannot bring your own wine either."}
{"text":"I know Pakistani food pretty well; grew up with it and have a mostly love/hate relationship with it. Dera is a decent restaurant in Park Ex and pretty cheap.

We started with the pakoras, which were unusually shaped and had a ton of onions. It was lighter than other pakoras I've tried, but it was nowhere near as good.

The saag is crazy delicious. It's unfortunate that they kinda plopped a tablespoon of butter on the very top before serving. It didn't need it and it certainly didn't look appetizing - they're lucky it's flavorful enough that I could overlook that. 

The butter chicken was bad. It's not a traditional Pakistani dish and their interpretation of it was poor. The oil was totally separated from the sauce. 

Also tried a fish dish that came on a hot plate with some other veggies. Simply ok.

So it was a little bit of a hit/miss for me. The samosas are on point tho! I'd definitely go back for that with some saag an naan, because those are the real hits in my opinion. 

Big thumbs up for the service! Awesome server brought us some free desserts; a rice pudding, and an order of those dessert balls in the sweet syrup. It was too sweet for my tastes, but it's gestures like that that stand out."}
{"text":"I absolutely Love Dera me being a meat eater I always subconciously judge an Indian restaurant by their lamb biryani. Dera always seems to have a good consistency for lamb biryanis, with the good recipe for the biryani and the meat staying always tender so you can smell the curry from the rice. I also highly reccomend their brain masala, butter chicken and beef jalfrezi. A big highlight is their rice milk pudding which is perfectly made, extremely creamy with nuts and just a little tiny hint of rosewater. They have a big room for guests and the location not that hard to get around to at all. However, the Staff is a little all over the place. They are all girls serving in trolley trays, but most can decently communicate in english and french. Over all a great place for good Pakistani food."}
{"text":"The worst eating experience ever.
Irony is i cant go lower than 1 star .
The lady who was serving was obnoxiously rude .we were served with murgh shahi curry ,the chicken was not cooked when we showed her she looked suspiciously at us which was so embarrassing. No apologies or replacement options were asked.but were served with same uncooked chicken curry.thanks but no thanks ."}
