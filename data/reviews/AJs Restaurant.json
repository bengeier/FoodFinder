{"text":"Although my husband had a decent burger with 2 thin patties I had chicken parmesan. The little pieces of fried chicken were perfectly cooked but the sauce was greasy and reminded me of Chef Boy R Dee. NASTY! The spaghetti noodles were also overcooked. The french fries were good."}
{"text":"Perfect restaurant if you're looking for good, fresh food with a small town feel. Not only is the food good quality, but their servers have excellent customer service and make you feel welcome and at home.  I eat here at least once a week and usually order the chicken snack. You get 4 strips of chicken, hush puppies and your choice of a side for only $5!  Its great if you are in a rush or if you want to sit down for an hour or so."}
{"text":"My wife grew up in Harrisburg, is fond of AJs. I got the Carolina style (chili,slaw,mustard,onions) cheeseburger, fries, and onion rings. I really liked the burger! I got it to go, and I figured that they do this because people ask for no salt often but the fries and onion rings weren't salted which through me off. However, added some salt and it was way better than my initial taste. I would just get the fries in the future because I think that salt should really be added to the onion ring batter. I really liked the friendly atmosphere must be infectious because even customers were friendly to me. I have been out of NC, and the Charlotte metro for a while and man I miss home. People are just so much friendlier. I'll be back the next time I visit my in-laws!"}
{"text":"Staff is very nice an helpful ,, food is great ,!! Wish they would open on Saturdays !"}
{"text":"My family and I are regulars at AJ's.  We eat here at least once a week.  It took a long time for us to try this place but once we did, we have not stopped coming.  I love the spaghetti dinner.  You can't go wrong eating here."}
{"text":"Staff here is always super friendly.  They take great care of us the entire time we are there. Prices are super affordable. Great little local spot."}
{"text":"Really good food. Everything I've had was pretty good. My favs include the Spaghetti, the grilled chicken sandwich and the cheese burger. The okra and fried squash are really good as well. The only problem I have is that not only do they not have an online menu, they don't have take home menus either. Which I've never experienced before. Somewhat of an inconvenience if you want to call in an order, but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Ummm simplemente delicioso, si quieres comer comida r√°pida, este es el lugar indicado. Tienen comida saludable y fresca, nada frizado, lo recomiendo"}
{"text":"Great food...great prices! This Harrisburg staple has something for everyone! American food with a Greek twist! It's family owned, so it's not open on the weekend, so get there during the week. Slouvaki (sp) is my favorite and they do it so well! Great fried fish too!"}
{"text":"Old school good food. Double cheeseburger. With a side of fried okra is the best! I always try to go when I am back in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This is THE best place in Harrisburg to get a GREAT chicken sandwich. The Southern Filet is awesome! The girls are a bit rude at times, but the food is good. Their salads and specials are good as well. Blows Harrisburg Family Restaurant out of the water!!"}
{"text":"We have lived in Harrisburg for 3 years and had never eaten at AJ's until last week. It was a good variety menu including burgers, salads, pita sandwiches and the people were nice. We will be back."}
{"text":"AJ's is one of those local eats that you simply must try. It's a simple, order at the counter kind of place that really knows how to deliver quick delicious food. The wait staff are helpful. AJ's usually always has a few specials on the menu.  Indoor dining only, and not a huge place by any means; though I haven't ever seen it packed out the door. Located along Highway 49 in Harrisburg, it can be easy to miss along a row of other restaurants and businesses. The pricing is reasonable for the portion sizes, ranging from around $6-10 for lunch.   I last went to AJ's with a group and found no complaints among friends from the variety of different dishes to include: chicken salad's, chicken tips and Mac n cheese, and the double pita burger I decided on. AJ's spaghetti is a hometown favorite, though I can't comment as I have yet to try it."}
{"text":"Similar to Showmar's but the food is better. My fiance likes the double pita burger and I have to admit, it's really good. The fried squash and okra is on point if you're into fried veggies. My favorites is the gyro platter or the gyro. We love eating here because of the small town feel and the friendliness and accommodating nature of the staff."}
{"text":"Food is very good. Local place that isn't open on weekends. Hamburgers and hamburger steak is very good. Lot of options with an American fare theme."}
{"text":"AJs is one of those places that is a local eat.  You've probably driven by it many times while In Harrisburg and just not noticed it.  AJ's is a family owned restaurant with very friendly wait staff and speedy service.    They aren't open on the weekend.  The restaurant is very clean but not fancy. Theres enough parking all the way around the building, which can accommodate large work trucks too.   For lunch you order at the counter and they bring the food to your table.  Food is served in food baskets with a liner or on disposable plates (depending on what you order.) Even if they are busy, food typically comes out within a couple of minutes.  They serve sandwiches, seafood, BBQ ( a little of something for everyone!) Every food plate that comes out looks more appetizing than the next.   My hands down favorite meal here is the spaghetti, served with a side salad - choice of dressing, slice of toast and a container of parmesan cheese for your spaghetti on the side.  One of the things that I like about their spaghetti is that it tastes home made.  Very filling and large portions that you probably wont be able to finish!   If I'm in Harrisburg around lunchtime, you can bet that I'm definitely eating here!"}
{"text":"This place is so good!  So glad we finally tried it.  Food is good, servers are awesome, and the place is spotless.  They could \"run a clinic\" on how to keep a restaurant clean!"}
