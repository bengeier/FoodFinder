{"text":"I've been to here 3 times now with different groups of friends and I just love it.  I love the fact that everyone in there is training at George Brown and, therefore, eager to please. It does mean the waiters are always really nervous but this is all part of the experience (last time the waitress tried to open the screw top wine bottle with a corkscrew). The food has always been amazing too - the best I've had in Toronto.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was part of a group of 4 diners on November 8 and we'd been looking forward to trying the Chef's House. We all live locally and passed the restaurant on an almost daily basis so we were certainly curious about it.
First impressions were good. The room's nice and we certainly appreciated the cleanliness.  However, we had issues with the service. Aside from frequent water glass refills, the service was slooooow. it took at least 20 minutes to get a glass of wine and the courses had equally long pauses between them.
There was also a significant communication problem as our main server was not fluent in English and had a very heavy accent.  It would probably help if he was coached to ask \"How did you like the food\" instead of \"How about it?\". 
As for the food, 3 out of 4 of us enjoyed our meals but none of them were outstanding. The lamb loin was done very well but was only accompanied by a couple of green beans and two undercooked glazed carrots. The pasta dish was pronounced \"weird tasting\" and despite being barely touched, there was no offer made to substitute the dish or remove it from the bill. 
Finally after nearly two hours, we were asked if we wanted \"more coffee\" when in fact we had given up trying to get any.  By this time we only wanted the bill.
I'm happy to support the George Brown culinary students, but clearly they need more trainig and more guidance on the restaurant floor.
The bill for four was $230 (before tip) for four three course dinners and five glasses of wine (no coffee).
I don't know if that's value for money but I do know we won't be back in a hurry."}
{"text":"I tried the Summerlicious Lunch menu, 3 course-$15.  I got to seat at the counter where I can watch students prepare my meal in front of me.  Great experience.

I had Starter: Niagara Prosciutto & Green Asparagus, Pickled Vegetables  (very fresh and tasty).
Main: Char-Grilled Salmon, Tomato, Cucumber & Feta Salad (very good, the salmon is fork tender just the way I like it)
Dessert: Ginger Scented Peach Crumble, Lemon Chantilly  (I don't taste the ginger, the peach filling is good, but the crust is too thick/hard for my liking.)

Service:  they will get better as time progress.

Time:  I know it will take longer for the food to arrive but it took 1.5 hour for a 3 course lunch is a little bit too long.  It is not for everyone, unless you have a day off or a very long lunch break.

The best part for me is that I had a chat with Chef Li who explain the creation of menu and food preparation. 

All in all, this is an unique restaurant with good food at a affordable price, nothing pretentious and most important of all, you can witness the birth of the next great chef.

I will be back to try the dinner menu at a later time."}
{"text":"I'm prob just too fussy, but I like waiters to wait and chefs to cook without adding hair, too much?

Food is good value, made possible by free labour (are the students paid min.?) and love that they put the savings back into ingredients.  App, main, fine, weak on dessert.  No one looked unhappy except when I found the hair in the greens bedding my pork belly confit, short one, male likely, good strong stock ; )  I debated sending it back.  It's such a horrible waste of food, I'd just gotten started on a portion twice above norm.  The tikka had also been beckoning, so I thought, yeah, let's switch, in case I get a pluck and re-serve.

So here's where the nice, petite asian server, esl, who didn't understand my questions when ordering, really got on my nerve.  She, limited by lang., said, \"Oh, a hair.\"  Then silence.  No apology, no shock, no embarrassment on behalf of kitchen, no immediate offer of refresher or alternate.  I made the request of tikka.  She seemed reluctant.  I said if it has to be the same, it's fine, but is it ok to change.  A terse \"it's ok\".  Came back quick with tikka, no smile, no apology, no bon appetit.  She seemed unhappy.

Water, forgotten, not refilled, awk lean-in when talking, it's a ear-whisper, wipes nose on sleeve mid-floor.  Dessert served by service trainer, smile, no mention of hair, he should've been informed, comp tea or coffee, norm, so sorry, blah blah.

Before I left, I debated whether I should tell the kid or the trainer, ya know, quick tips.  Thought I didn't want the kid to get a bad grade, so I opted kid.  Mistake.  I don't know how much she understood.  First, I asked if she'd like some tips.  Poor choice, confused her, changed to \"advice\", she smiled and said, yes.  Pointed out above, she smiled, but as I walked out, I sensed daggers.  Oh, I left out the sleeve bit. 

Eventful lunch.  Unresponsive management so far.  Hmm.  It is a training college, yet I bet my server has not learned an effective script for esl students when dealing with things that are bound to happen during service.  I'd suggest as much, and, students, demand more from your instructors if you want a job later."}
{"text":"We had lunch for 5 for Summerlicious at The Chef's House today.  The people here are the elite difference -- helpful, warm, and hospitable.  Every single individual -- from our hostesses, to the wait staff, to the manager -- who packaged our items \"to go\" were so kind!  We'll be back just to see these wonderful folks!"}
{"text":"The Chef's House is George Brown' newest addition to it's chef's teaching college. Essentially it's both a school where chef's in the program can get practical experience and a functioning restaurant. It's brand new and still working out the kinks like no liquor license, walk ups, take out or a la carte lunch. It's a prix fixe menu at around $40 for three courses and it's constantly changing because of guest celebrity chefs doing 7-14 week stints throughout the year."}
{"text":"I have heard nothing but great reviews of this place so I had high hopes for this George Brown College culinary arts program run restaurant.  Unfortunately it didn't live up to its reputation.

The food: was no better than on par with a comparable restaurant. The one annoyance with the food was that the menu did a poor job of describing what each dish was. Everyone at my table was surprised at the appearance/composition of every dish.

The service: Shockingly bad. First off the first thing I noticed was that there was more than double the amount of people on site compared to restaurants of comparable size. Unfortunately that didn't translate into great service. The delivery of the food was borderline comical with none of the servers having any idea who ordered what and giving everyone the wrong plate. Even basics like sufficient cutlery were botched. 

Other annoyance: lack of an espresso machine.

Needless to say I'm in no hurry to go back, which given its convenient location is a shame.

Am I being to harsh on students? I don't think so, after all I have been served by countless people in this age bracket over the years. These were just clueless.

One accommodation I am making is that normally this would be a 2 star review, the extra star is consideration for a good effort put on by the student chefs."}
{"text":"This place used to be on Adelaide where the Culinary School was. My brother has recommended I go, so I reserved a table for 2 for a lunch date the day before the bustle of Winterlicious was set to start. We were the first to arrive. I understand the establishment is coordinated by students and their instructors. The host I guess was not ready for us to arrive, we probably got her by surprise because she just stared at us blanky, before taking us to our table.  

We ordered the 3 course lunch for $25 Prix Fixe.

APPS: Lentil Soup and Salad greens
-The soup was spiced right with a kick and lentils had been cooked enough so they still had some depth.
MAIN: Sausage with Horse radish mash and Tilapia on a bed of Greens
- The sausage seemed too sweet on the bed of carmalized onions
- The tilapia was fresh, and seared just right, amazingly moist and flakey.
DESSERT: Cardamom Creme Brulee
- When you first take a taste, the flavour is quite warm and spicy from a traditional creme brulee!

It's a place where learning occurs. So you see the coaching done by the instructors and students.  The service was great, and so was the food.  Gourmet quality and presentation for an outstanding price. I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Super slow in service; Food is just ok; No wireless POS machine."}
{"text":"Good concept restaurant where the culinary and hospitality students of George Brown College cooks and serves you. Great opportunity for the students to hone their skills and gain valuable real life experiences.

The dining  experience can either be a hit or miss depending on the students on shift. The pricing for the prix-fixe dinner courses were amazing.  Three courses for $41 or four courses for $47 (additional appetizer or dessert). Decent wine selection at various reasonable prices.

My recent visit was a somewhat not memorable as what I experienced in the past.  The hostess was soft spoken upon me entering the restaurant as I told her I had reservation.  Luckily the restaurant is small, so I noticed my friends immediately and seated myself.

Although friendly service, the server at our table was also soft spoken and we had to ask him to repeat himself numerous times. Perhaps he was nervous or having a bad day, but he didn't seem to want to be there.

We ordered  a bottle of white wine which was not chilled enough, so it had to sit on ice for a while before we poured our own wine. Not once did the server refilled our wine glasses and even took our glasses away when we still had wine left in the bottle - an absolute no-no in the restaurant dining experience.  One should always check to see if there's any wine left in the bottle before taking away the glasses or offering if we needed more wine.

The amuse bouche that was served wasn't described to us, but we managed to flag someone down so they can explain what it was.  The appetizers and mains were delicious and flavourful.  Salmon appetizers was very fresh tasting and calamari was cooked lightly, but could use a bit more colour.
The lamb was cooked to a good medium which made the meat quite tender and very tasty. The sea bream was cooked  beautifully and was fresh and flaky. Plus everything was presented nicely, almost too nice to eat.

The only concern was the desserts which didn't seem fresh.  I had the black plum tart which seemed like it just came straight out of the refrigerator, would have been nice if it was warmed up a little.  My friend had the carrot cake which was a bit on dry side.  Another friend had the cheesecake which was nice and fluffy, but a little on the smaller size compared to the other desserts.

Also, the server didn't offer us any coffee or tea until after we completely finished the desserts; luckily for us no one at our table wanted any coffee/tea to go with desserts or else they would have asked for it when the desserts were served.

Overall, it wasn't a terrible experience, but the service could use some improvement.  The Chef House is definitely a good restaurant to support the future chefs and hospitality service in the city."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious. Had a 3 course meal with a drink. The pace was very slow, I think the entire meal took 3 hrs. I understand that the restaurant is staffed by students, but that is too long. One of the servers made a mistake of refilling my cocktail with water... The food was ok."}
{"text":"The food was great, the service not so much.

We asked for the four course dinner but only received three.  Our server didn't seem to be very familiar with the menu, and was visibly nervous talking to us.  There was nothing wrong with the service, but it never felt completely right either.

The food itself was delicious, and everything we ordered was cooked perfectly.

There is definite value for the money at the Chef's House, and I believe in supporting students as they learn.  I will give this restaurant another shot, but the service really does need to improve."}
{"text":"I have had reservations booked at The Chef's House every Wednesday for the last 8 years at noon sharp. I've enjoyed the most pleasant of experiences a human palate can enjoy.. The Chef's House (nee Siegfried's) is a new name for a very old culinary philosophy: great ideas made well. 

Lunch is one of the last innocent pleasures in life; it ought to be earned, yet simple and refreshing. The hour or more I spend amongst the ever-changing faces of these culinary visionaries is mostly spent pretending that I too could envision, build and share such delicious creations. Every ingredient has a destiny for greatness and its destiny is assured in the hands of these skilled and dedicated life-long Flavour Apprentices,. 

Sitting in the restaurant watching the television screens shadowing each Chef coaxing their creations to its ripeness of life, is as much a pleasure as tasting it. For me, lunch at the Chef's House is what lunch was meant to be: a moment of pure innocence. 

To the Instructor's, Staff and Students: a heart felt thank you, and see you Wednesday :)"}
{"text":"Just had my first experience for lunch. Although the food and wine were very good and very reasonably priced, the service really wasn't there, it actually became comical after a while. First of all, no mention of my food allergy was ever made, even though the restaurant had called me upon making my reservation on open table to get information. The sever we had was extremely timid and really not knowledgeable about the menu, she wasn't able to answer basic questions about the food. Water was never refilled the entire time and we had to flag her down to get some more. I tried calling a guy that was standing around, but was not able to get his attention even after many excuse me and waiving my arms at him. Every other patron in the area heard me and noticed, except him. He just walked away to the back. Did I mention he was standing only about 8 feet away when all this happened? Taking plates away from the table also seemed quite challenging for the server. Could only take one butter plate away at a time! Perhaps a staff member (manager) should be standing around specifically to observe and correct the students in private. In a real world restaurant situation these poor kids would not survive an entire shift or even an hour. Focus should definitely be given on training towards proper customer service."}
{"text":"As others have mentioned, the staff are truly polite and eager, but very green. A little overly eager at times. But it is great to see they are learning excellent service methods: not taking away one diner's plate before others are finished (a lost art!), refiling glasses etc.
The food was... OK. Frankly it really seemed there was more attention on plating and making everything LOOK good over the flavours. We were struck by how often we tried a new piece and thought \"nothing, no flavour at all\".
Venison carpacio: pasty and bland.
Tomato appetizer: also bland, except for bits of feta and the tasty tomato water.

But there were also several lovely pieces. The lamb was wonderfully cooked, though the brown sauce was too salty;  the peach dessert had lovely surprise flavours and crunch. But the rest was a little disappointing.

Overall we enjoyed the experience, if in a teacherly way, but the food tended to look better than it tasted."}
{"text":"Serving sizes are super small considering it still is a teaching college.  So  you wont get very full most likely. Servers were nice and rating is just related to food qty vs price."}
{"text":"The Chef's House is a training facility for George Brown College Cooking School and Service. I was just ok with the over all experience. Not at all what I remember when it was on Adelaide Street. I expected it to be fun an experience and it wasn't. The food was definitely high quality food but the portions are so small you will likely leave hungry.  The service was not good (understandable/training) and the atmosphere was very cold and unwelcoming.  I had the rainbow trout appetizer, the chicken breast roast for main course and the tiramisu desert. All tasted amazing but were all really just sample sizes or maybe this is what a serving size is suppose to be. My bill came to $40, no wine and I left hungry and unsatisfied and that's all that matters."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last week for dinner with friends.

The restaurant is run by the Chef students of George Brown College.

The menu is pre fixe consisting of a starter, main and dessert.

I am basing this review on my menu choices which were as follows:

STARTER:
Seared Scallop on a bed of diced tomato with a side consisting of pressed melon with beet sorbet.
 - The combination of hot and cold was brilliant. Flavourful and fresh. Five star presentation

MAIN:
Grilled fish on a bed of cous cous with vegetables
 - Fresh fish grilled perfectly, complimented nicely with the sides. 

DESSERT:
Rhubarb mousse cake 
 - I was expecting a more distinct rhubarb taste but it was more like a strawberry shortcake. The cake was moist and perfectly sliced. I enjoyed it irregardless.

The service from the moment we arrived to when we left was fantastic. The server was professional, friendly and extremely knowledgable of the food they were serving and also the local wine selections.

A evening enjoyed by everyone. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"A for effort, 3 star for overall food quality and experience.  I was really excited to come to a restaurant run by a culinary school as my other experiences with similar institutions in other cities have all been stellar.  I love the idea of school program run places where students can get a taste of their profession and obtain real life experiences.

The value for lunch was incredible - $25 for a four course meal.  I got 2 appetizers (cured meats plate - soso selection, meh presentation; beet salad - yummy!), a main (osso bucco - way too large of a portion for me, unappealing presentation, pretty good taste-wise) and a dessert (rice pudding tart - yummy, but it looked like it's been sitting around for too long).  I also tried a sticky toffee cake where the butter rum sauce was absolutely amazing.  The featured chef was from the Italian cooking program, and it was great that I was able to mix and match the regular menu with the featured dishes from the chef.

The service was distinctly student, but I didn't mind too much.  What I mean is that a few details of fine dining were missed.  For example, the drinks didn't come until after the appetizers arrived, a server took away my fellow diner's plate while she was still chewing on her last bite without asking her if she wanted it gone, lots of shaky arrangements of the table setting when presenting the food, another server didn't know what the 'whitefish' was when asked (he said it was salmon, but we later found out it was actually trout), and the list goes on.  However, the general politeness, eagerness to help, and attentiveness was very much noted and appreciated.

I'd definitely recommend this place for an interesting time and for the great overall value."}
{"text":"Went here with a groupon and was treated with first class service and hospitality.

The service was memorable..but not for great or bad reasons.  The service staff wanted to be sooooo helpful, soooo polite and sooooo good to you but they were just a very confused bunch.  IT really showed that this was a training kitchen (with all staff being trained at george brown).

Like, don't get me wrong- service was EXCELLENT- but it was more well-intentioned than \"flawless\".  Every server just seemed so...green...and like..green as in..more green than just the average person who decides they want to do a serving job.

Can you tell I hate to make this critique?  But it is so true, I can't help it.  
I love the people here and wish them the best of luck for the future. 

The food was good- not amazing, but very good.  The amount was very substantial- I could have shared a four course with someone and it would have been enough.

Not all dishes were as good as others...some where confusing and missing a finesse that you would get at a fine dining place.  But understandable given that this is a training kitchen.

What I love most about this place is the outside.  you can watch the chef's cook up a meal, bake the delicious breakds and desserts that will be served..and just an overall fun window to watch as you are walking by king street.

I have to say I would not choose to come back unless somebody I knew was training there.
It was good, and a definite must-try if you live in Toronto.  But I would not go back just for the food."}
{"text":"I know these kids are just learning but this was a joke.  Actually left laughing about how bad it was.

Summary:

Waiter spoke zero English and could comprehend nothing that didn't involve pointing to the menu

Said waiter spent most of the time hitting on another waitress (which seems reasonable since they're in college I guess) and sitting around giggling like schoolgirls for most of our dinner

Food was bland, poorly cooked and poorly presented

Service (if you haven't guessed) was awful to non-existent

Asked for a four course meal, was charged for a four course meal, but only received three.  Language barrier came in huge here.  Decided to just pay for the missing course in the interest of more expeditiously leaving and forgetting I had ever been."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here today because I was in the area.  
Yes, the servers seemed \"green\" as someone else mentioned, but my server was quite attentive to keeping the water refilled and responded to menu questions.  She didn't know what everything was off the top of her head as I would expect in a normal establishment, but she had notes or quickly got answers to our questions.  Since I really care about the response and not the delivery I was content.

I had the soup of the day.  It was nice but not memorable.  It was topped with a slightly sweet beef jerky type garnish.  My coworker and I were commenting on how good it was and were told it was veal tongue.  How about that?  So good that my coworker and I raved about tongue!

The beef stew was nice and I finished with the olive oil dark chocolate mousse.  It was my favorite consistency for a mousse and wasn't too dark.

It was a good experience and I believe the culinary school in Charlotte has a similar restaurant so I need to check that out.

One draw back was that to me it seemed very busy.  People were constantly walking back and forth, back and forth.  I eat out almost every meal and this place seemed much more active and it was odd."}
{"text":"Went here with my family during winterlicious. Great price for a 3 course dinner meal.
I like their contemporary atmosphere, very attentive (though a little bit nervous) staff and delicious food. 
Even on regular priced menu this place is great for the value and service.
I had onion soup for appetizer. It was amazing. Filled by gnocchi that were covered in finger licking sauce and an apple strudel dessert with sorbet. The Italian theme was definitely a great choice:)"}
{"text":"If your into getting a good meal, at a fair price than this place is a great idea. The students at George Brown do what they do best....well try to at least...and that's cooking! Remember, they are students!

The restaurant itself just moved into the new location on King St. With an open aired, street level location.
The food is created through the desire of the students, and one of the most sought after programs in the country - Culinary Arts Program.
The menu itself changes radically from one day to the next based on the students curriculum, and weekly \"celebrity\" Chef. You should call in advance to get the menu for the particular day. Or click on their website for Menu updates.
The restaurant offers lunch service from 11:30-1:30, and dinner service from  6-8:30. They also have a catering service, and take out bakery.

What they have done is quit remarkable, created a group called Tastes of Tomorrow. Every Wednesday the Tastes of Tomorrow are bringing local, fair, clean produce and other goodies to you for a reasonable cost! Its somewhat of a way to reach out to the consumers, without them having to travel to get inspired food & drink.
How cleaver.

A must for any diner!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out for Winterlicious and I really liked it.  I love how the students get a hands on experience because that's how you learn, not from textbooks but from experiences.

Sure the service was not stellar but you have to come in knowing that they are going to make mistakes so be understanding and patient. 

I would definitely come back and show my support, here's to the future Chefs and servers...best of luck!

Cheers"}
{"text":"First time here with some classmates celebrating the completion of our program.

Most of our group arrived a half hour early of our reservation but the staff and students were still welcoming regardless. For this week there was an additional menu designed and created by one of the current Italian post-grad students, all of whom having recently returned from their international placements in Italy. So it was nice to be able to choose from the special weekly menu in addition to their regular lunch menu for the current season/semester. 

I had the house cured trout gravlax with honey mustard sauce and shoestring potatoes for my starter which I found to have a nice fresh taste, the acidity of the dressing balanced the savoury salmon very well. 

For my entrée I had prosciutto wrapped filet of pork with hollandaise sauce, fingerling potatoes and asparagus. The pork was perfectly cooked and I thoroughly enjoyed the delicate balance of the creamy hollandaise combined with the acidity of the balsamic vinaigrette which complemented the pork wonderfully. 

For dessert I had the hot-house rhubarb tart with sour cream gelato and raspberry coulis. While initially unsure of the concept of sour cream gelato I went with this choice because the sound of the rhubarb tart and raspberry coulis had me sold and neither of those two aspects disappointed me. However, I absolutely loved the sour cream gelato and found it simply divine, possibly even the best part of the entire dessert especially when eaten together with the raspberry coulis. 

Lastly the servers (and their uniforms!) were great too."}
{"text":"Good food packaged with awesome service!

I am very proud of the George Brown Students! I booked a table for 16 and the servers took care of us very well. Despite of the small mishap of over cooking a couple of beef skirts, they took it back eagerly replacing the entire dish.


Duck Confit Rillette - AWESOME! It was my favourite dish of the night (not considering dessert). Duck + duck liver + duck fat = oh my goodness! They also serve it in a very cute baby pot.

Beef Skirt - The cut of the meat is tough to begin with, so I think they could tenderize the meat first, but the flavour is phenomenal. I want that recipe!

Chocolate Souffle - *drool* The texture it's something between a spongecake and mousse. It's like a bouncy castle! It's delish! 

The best thing about this place is that the menu never gets old. They are always changing things up."}
{"text":"Mike, Karen and Greg have done an excellent job reviewing the Chef's House. Yes, it is staffed by students, but students under the watchful eye of amazing chefs. 

I had lunch there to visit with visiting Executive Chef Michael McKinnon, a Green Jacket award-winning chef...and a great guy. We went to High School together. Visiting with Chef in the middle of a lunch chaos was effortless, and congratulations to server Hossain, for doing a splendid job accomodating us. After a great chat, my wife and I dined on two main dishes prepared by two fourth-year students -- she had the tilapia on a bed of sweet potatoes and steamed spinach...\"yumbolo\" says my wife. Me, I dined on jerk chicken on a bed of rice, black beans, plantains and stewed tomatoes. Mmmmm. A tad predictable dishes, but very well put together. The appetizers were yumbola as well...me, quinoa served chilled and pressed with an avacado puree and sour cream with a dash of red pepper glaze. My lovely had a smoked salmon conconction that she raved over. Hossain told us the salmon was smoked on premises. Nice touch. The desserts were mmmmmm and the coffee was really good. I had the creme brule and wifey had the pound cake. Yes, pound cake! Where the hell can you get good pound cake any more. 

Highly recommend the experience. Reservations are a bitch and you should use OpenTable to guarantee. Dont just walk in.

Almost forgot, if you like spicy, try the Jack Daniels Lemonade infused with Thai chili peppers. Again, yumbolo."}
{"text":"It seems like every week there's a new Groupon for The Chef's House, so I finally bit the bullet and bought one.

We arrived about an hour prior to our reservation and were given what I can only assume is the worst table in the house. (It was way at the back by the stairs to the washroom and the bar.) I'm not complaining about this, though, since they certainly didn't have to seat us until our reservation.

Anyway, I decided to start with the Pan-fried Sardines (Sicilian Salsa, Crispy Cinnamon Onions). The sardines themselves were the clear highlight, as they were cooked very well and were very tasty. The \"Sicilian salsa\" didn't fare quite as well, since it consisted of a whole bunch of veggies that didn't really cohere very well. It just seemed like a random assortment of carefully-cut vegetables that were placed atop the sardines with little thought as to how they were merge with the whole dish.

I had a similar complaint with my main, the Seared Kingfish (Coconut Curry Sauce, Mango Chutney). Again, the fish itself was cooked very well but all its accompaniments just felt as though they'd been randomly thrown onto the plate because they looked good (rather than how they complimented the protein).

Dessert was Peach Upside-Down (Basil Crème Anglaise, Cardamom Ice Cream) and it was fine. My biggest issue with this one was just how big it was. It was an unreasonably oversized portion that left me feeling sick afterwards, since I did finish it (on account of I'm a pig).

The Chef's House is a decent restaurant that charges way, way more than it should. I like the idea of supporting students, but the place is charging an amount similar to that of most restaurants, and that's unwarranted and unreasonable."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place doesn't have a higher rating. This is wonderful restaurant in the heart of Old Toronto with good food, you can't even tell it's a learning place for culinary and hospitality students!

We had a four course meal with entrees of roasted chicken leg and pork loin. Our appetizers were just...blah. I had caramelized onions in a tart and a cold cauliflower salad. Meh. 

However... My chicken was cooked perfectly, with a crispy skin and tender, juicy fully cooked middle. The chicken was so good, it was like it started melting as I started chewing. It sat on top of a bread pudding slice, that was a sweet compliment. 

The pork loin was cooked the same, except it was wrapped in puff pastry (I think) and was soft and tender, but still fully cooked. The students who cooked our meal really deserve a round of applause. 

Our waiter was polite and prompt. He was very professional and always checked up on us - filling our waters (without asking!), asked how we liked our food, and even gave us a heads up on when our next dish would be coming up. Too good.

The menu is probably going to change soon, so I would recommend getting the roasted chicken entree and for dessert, STICKY TOFFEE CAKE! This cake is life! So moist, so not too sweet, with a little kick of spice and ginger..UGH! SO GOOD."}
{"text":"So, for my friend's birthday I took him to The Chefs' House located on King and Jarvis. It's been a restaurant we have both had our eyes on for a while. The Chefs' House is a one of a kind, fully functional teaching school run by the Culinary School at George Brown. Dining at this restaurant was quite the experience. They had an open layout kitchen concept with tvs along the walls so diners could watch the students cook their food. It's a great place to go for the experience, as for the food - the chefs are students after all. Dinner usually goes for about $40 dollars for a 3 course meal and $45 dollars for a 4. 

Honestly, the best part of my meal was the appetizers. I ordered the beef yukke (raw beef) with a light seaweed and cucumber salad. It was a nice start however when it came to my main dish (Scallop & Butternut Risotto) it was a disaster. The risotto was overly salty and the scallops still had sand in them. All in all, everything was overly seasoned. The main courses had too much salt and the desserts were too sweet. However, I have to comment, the service at The Chefs' House was superb. Angel, our waiter was really on the ball. Usually, I would never remember a waiters' name so, being able to recall her a month after is really something.

Honestly, $40 for a 3 course meal isn't bad however, getting good food is really going to depend on the working students that night."}
{"text":"I know this restaurant is about value, but i honestly don't see it. 

I had the three course for $41 and don't think it was necessarily worth it. There are tonnes of good places around the city that will do a prefix at the same price, and the food will be better. I think overall, i can see that the place has good quality ingredients, but considering it's nothing more than a test run, i don't see the comparative value in $41.  And don't get me wrong, i don't mind paying $100 on a good meal, but only if it's worth it. 

Maybe i came on an off night, but i found my grapefruit and heirloom salad to be a little too bland and the steak horribly overcooked. The cheese plate we had was great, except the server was unable to tell us what cheeses were on the plate. The service was a little awkward and i found hair in the bread. 

I will likely try this place again - i've heard so much from friends, but for now, i'm not really convinced it's worth it."}
{"text":"Went here for summerlicious 2016. We got there a little early. We were the first people there for dinner service that day and the student were just getting ready for dinner that night. The hostess was very friendly and welcoming. We were seated right away and shortly after that we were greeted by our waiter. We ordered their signature water (\"Q Water\") and took some time to decide on our drink order. I ordered a pineapple mimosa. 
After the drinks the waiter brought us some bread. Oh my god! This bread was so good! I usually pass on the bread but I was so glad that I didn't this time. Because we enjoyed the bread so much our waiter was nice enough to bring us another basket of this deliciousness. 
Next came the appetizers. My husband got the chilled leek and potato soup with smoked trout and I got the asparagus salad. Both were excellent. 
For the mains he got the pork chop with peach compote and vegetable succotash. I got the chicken with salad nicoise. Both the pork and the chicken were moist and juicy and cooked to perfection. 
For desert we got the dark chocolate cake and the citrus semifreddo. Both were delicious but the chocolate cake stood out more in terms of flavor combinations. 
This whole restaurant is run by students from a number of programs at George Brown with the supervision of a head chef and one other staff member. This is great because it provides them with hands on experience. We were told that the students don't get paid instead they get credits towards the program. All in all this was an excellent meal with great hospitality in a great ambiance. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to my lunch here, though I probably should have set my expectations lower when I was informed that our party of 10 would all have to select exactly the same dishes (a significant challenge as there are a couple of us with severe allergies).
The end result was an uninteresting meal (overdressed salad, undercooked oily fish) and two courses that I could not eat as the kitchen had not accounted for food allergies (despite saying that they would). 
While I love the concept of the Chef's House the execution is lacking."}
{"text":"The setting and location are great and everyone was very nice and attentive. Unfortunately I can't say the same about the food. Nothing was great and a few things were actually awful.

I admire the initiative of brown college, and I understand that all chefs are students in learning proces, but at 35$ per person (without drinks). Chefs house is really  not worth going to"}
{"text":"As this is a teaching restaurant for George Brown, you have to keep in mind that some of these students have had no experience in the hospitality industry. The food was amazing (always is, every time I go), but if would have been really great if our server could have actually said more than 2 words to us.

Each time we would state something for our order, we would inevitably have to say it two or three times while pointing at the item on the menu. I don't think she spoke English at all. It was other servers that described our food or checked in on us. She mixed up my drink order and dropped off the bill without any pleasantries or intructions on where to pay.

The food, of course = perfection and this is where the stars come from. The heirloom and feta app was well executed with little balsamic pearls. I LOVE me some molecular gastronomy. My sister had the mushroom soup and loved it. My chicken/ravioli main was flavourful but the star was the sous-vide pork my sister got. It was smoky, sweet, salty, and silky. She could have eaten 5 more.

Our desserts were the basic deconstructed thang everyone is going for lately.
Sis had blueberry compote with a shortcake and some blueberry ice.
I had lemon curd with strawberries. This was topped with a lovely pistachio meringue.

All in all, always a pleasure to eat the food here. The service is bizarre, but if you go with low expectations, you'll have a nice meal!

{"text":"This place is run by students with a head Chef overseeing. You can tell a lot of them are still perfecting their craft as the servers can be nervous and the food is a toucher slower. Though the effort they put into ensure a great dining experience is fantastic. 

The menu is very technically difficult to execute and my chicken was perfectly cooked like a result of the students putting in extra effort to make sure it is just right. Though the menu is not inspiring, but I'm not surprised as this place is still a school. 

In terms of price this is a great deal and this is likely because tuition or how they are all students i can see why the cost is so competitive.  

Overall I would recommend going as it it is refreshing to see how hard young minds in the restaurant industry will put i. The extra effort to make a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and try new foods!

This is probably the reasons why George Brown and their culinary school are so successful. 

This place is run by students and oversee by a Head Chef. The students are amazing and their ability to think quick on their feet. 

We had the most lovely time during Winterlicious and looking forward to going back for Summerlicious."}
{"text":"Services: I like the services here. Although the server are students but they look cute. Not very perfect sometimes but they are serious about what they do.

Food: The food overall are pretty good especially the dessert. Open kitchen, good hygiene. Just a bit salty tho

Ambiance: Good design, modern, not very noisy."}
