{"text":"I had heard amazing things about Bice from my boyfriend, whose uncle frequents the restaurant, so we decided to try it out as a belated Valentine's day meal. 

The inside of the restaurant seems a bit small, but that only adds to the intimacy of the place. The tables were well spaced so it wasn't crowded.

THE FOOD: We started off with the \"Fried crab cake, lime and black pepper mayo, grilled corn, cucumber and coriander salsa\" ($17). I don't normally eat seafood, let alone any kind of shellfish, but this was AMAZING. The mayo was crazy good...you know those Miss Vickie's Lime and Cracked Black Pepper chips? It tasted like that. Only in MAYO FORM!

For the main course, the boyfriend ordered the 
\"Rigatoncini, Italian sausage, tomatoes, smoked caciocavallo and bufal\" ($24) whereas I had the \"Pappardelle \"rosé\" with mozzarella di bufala and fresh basil\" ($24). The pappardelle was cheesey, but not too cheesey, and in my opinion, was better than the rigatoncini, which was good as well. 

The only reason why Bice doesn't warrant 5 stars is because the wait staff is made up of young boys, who are either overly eager, clearing our dishes and cutlery as soon as we had put it down, or super forgetful. But other than that, everything was memorable."}
{"text":"Getting married or having an event. Do it here. I've been to several and its always top notch."}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant with my parents. The patio and the general ambiance are very lovely. I believe every table were used, but the patio didn't feel crowded.

For the food, the general consensus for us was that it was excellent. There is a nice selection of Italian items with a nice touch of sophistication.

The only downside for us seemed to be the service. At one point our server seemed like he had too much stuff to take care and some minor things were forgotten.

Overall, a nice experience and would certainly come back in a future visit in Montreal."}
{"text":"Went here on our last night visiting Montreal for my birthday dinner. I enjoyed some of the best pasta I've ever had. I had the pappardelle with tomato cream sauce, my boyfriend had the squid ink fettuccine with seafood, and we split some spicy rapini. Both meals were incredible. I ordered the cannoli for dessert and mine came out with a sparkler on it for my birthday. The Cannoli's were yummy, a little sweeter than the traditional ones I've had. My boyfriend had the espresso creme brûlée and that was fantastic as well. Over all 5 star meal!"}
{"text":"Too slowww! We waited 30 mins for our main dish! 

food is not good either"}
{"text":"What an AMAZING restaurant. Food is freshly made and you know it. Service is fantastic and friendly. I had a three course meal, the anti-pasti was great, the pasta dish was phenomenal, and the dessert heavenly. Truly a fantastic experience. 

The decor and seating (outside) was also great."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. The decor is rustic, romantic and somehow quaint considering how large it is.

Food was okay. Definitely not worth the hype or prices but it was a cute spot for dinner. There's definitely better food in Montreal at this price."}
{"text":"I went there during summertime. The restaurant setting is just beautiful. They have a beautiful terrasse. The food was very good and the service was impeccable ! I highly recommend this restaurant ."}
{"text":"The outdoor seating area is very nice, but they offer a very limited number of beers.  Food was good, as was the service."}
{"text":"I originally called roughly 2 weeks ago to make a reservation for my wifes birthday on the 30th of October. When i called , the man i spoke with responded by saying \"hmm let me see , thats a saturday..... ya were all booked\" I then said , hmm ok , what about the day beofore , on the 29th? he said ya , we are all booked friday aswell. 

After hanging up , i thought about it , and relized that the 30th was a sunday , not a saturday... So clearly the man on the phone didn't even look into the shedule. he just assumed, and or didn't care. 

After realizing this i checked to see if i could make a reservation online , to get around the man who clearly has no interest in booking a rezo. 

I successfully made a reservation ..... or so i thought. 

A few days later , maybe a week or so ( it was a monday they called ) i got a call from someone in the evening to tell me there was a glitch in their system , and they have a wedding booked for the 30th.

that was it. thats how it ended. now its my wifes birthday this weekend , and im gonna look like an a-hole."}
{"text":"Visiting from NYC on a business trip, I was impressed by the service and decor. I had high expectations of the food, however it was nothing to rave about, my appetizer ( buratta) and pasta with arugula were drenched in oil! Top it off I had my heart set on the blueberry tart only to be dissapointed when our server informed us they didn't have it and that he would make it up to me which he didn't, I settled for the hazelnut ice cream cake which again nothing to rave about! Great service but lay off the oil in your food everything seems so greasy!"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this restaurant for business meetings, romantic dinners or even dinner with the family.
The service is outstanding, they have valet which is always a plus downtown, and their food is modern and delicious!! 
I had the branzino and caesar salad. Great flavours and amazing presentation!"}
{"text":"What a gem of a restaurant! This is not the sort of place I would usually bring my toddler to, as it is very upscale and elegant, but for an early supper out we thought, \"why not ?\" as I was dying to try this place on a recent visit to Montreal. The waitstaff was more than friendly and accommodating and never made us feel out of place. We opted to stay indoors as it was a particularly chilly evening, but they have the most beautiful terrace for warmer evenings. The inside of the restaurant has a contemporary/modern elegance set in a neutral color palette, with comfortable tables and banquette seating around the perimeter. The food certainly lived up to their reputation as one of Montreal's finest. We shared tender crab cakes, succulent grilled octopus and plump shrimp tempura with a spicy mayo dipping sauce. My husband also sampled the rare seared fillet mignon with wild mushrooms that he raved about. They brought us a cracker and dip platter with three dips (a guacamole, eggplant caviar and white bean puree), and I can tell you I secretly wanted to lick the little dish clean of the white bean it was so good! For entree' I had a Chilean Sea Bass with saffron lobster risotto and spinach, with the largest chunks of lobster I'd ever seen in even a main dish, never mind as a side! I could've eaten a whole bowl of just the risotto, it was amazing, but then to top it with a tender and flaky Chilean Sea Bass?! I was in heaven...The waiter suggested the Cavatelli for my three year-old, and I could kiss him for that, as I had never seen my son eat so much in one sitting! The pasta was perfectly al dente, and the tomato sauce was perfect in it's simplicity, the best I've eaten. My husband, who is not a pasta fan, soon finished off what my little guy couldn't and I dipped my bread into the last traces of that delicious sauce. We finished off our feast with a dessert sampling of homemade sorbets (refreshing and delicious), warm chocolate souffle (wow!), mini tiramisu cups, cheesecake bites and a nutty bar that was amazing! If you are in Montreal and looking for a fantastic meal in an elegant environment, do not miss Bice, it's a must try!"}
{"text":"The food here was very good! We came for lunch and they only offered a prefix menu which was a bit limited but the meal I selected was pretty good. I started with the arugula salad, followed by the grilled sea bass. My boyfriend started with the grilled squid and followed by the veal scallopini. The ambiance in this space was truly delightful, reminiscent of a treehouse:)"}
{"text":"Just returned from a visit to Montreal and this was my favorite meal of the whole trip. Like the first reviewer, we dined out on the canopied patio. It was enchanting!

We had a lovely, leisurely meal...great wine, fantasic crab cake, wonderful pastas and desserts. The servers worked at a team (and were all nice looking young men!) and provided great service. 

Would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting Montreal and looking for an upscale Italian meal with great ambiance and service!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible!  Gorgeous restaurant with fantastic food and an accommodating, friendly staff. I still think about the burrata!  Go! You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere
Place was full but we still managed to get a table with no reservation 
It was Saturday night so the place was filled with beautiful girls 
The food is Amazing
We started with a great bottle of wine and the Burrata along with the Carpaccio both were incredible.

For the main dish I had the Pappardelle which is delicious home made noodles with a simple sauce and mushrooms to die for.
We also had dessert which was on the house it was three different desserts which we shared.

Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Great date night dinner in Montreal.  The food is fresh especially with the fresh pasta selection.  Yummy!! Had the papardelle with rose sauce and buffala mozzarella.  Delicious and perfect. The fish specials were wonderfully and plentiful.  We had the swordfish and sea bass.  So good and fresh perfect for a summer's day!!  

The terrace is stunning and the patio out front is great except they still allow smoking in the patio.  Unappetizing except we lucked out that the wind was not blowing the smoke towards our table.  It is frequented by Stereotypical caricatures of European party crowd but if you are lucky it can be a nicer crowd.  

I would go here for lunch to experience the terrace again."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant so far in Montreal! We had an amazing seafood pasta with truffle oil and amazing risotto!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a couple of times, and honestly I had the best pasta I've ever had in my life. It was so delicious. And the vibe of the place was extremely formal and classy. It was overall perfect.

Also, the noise level is very minimal so that's also great. Tables are rather far apart so it doesn't feel like you're sitting with someone else as well. The food the service, everything was great!"}
{"text":"Tres Chic, Oh La La.. Took my brother for his birthday dinner. Entree was Césare Salad with deep
Fried Brie croute .As the main dish I had Spinach Gnocchi with Ricotta which was very light. Bob had the Grilled Shrimps that were huge with a citrus barley and broccolini. Dessert was frozen lemon tart with blueberry compote. Food was great! Big space with beautiful decor. Perfect for
big groups also. Since I was paying the bill I can tell you it's expensive but I only take my brother Bob out once a year! Lol"}
{"text":"Superbe restaurant, la cuisson, l'assaisonnement tout était parfait vraiment rien a dire, tartare de saumon, poulet avec des légumes vraiment délicieux.
Le restaurant offre une belle carte vin qui aurait pu avoir un peu de bon vin français, argentin ou chilien... car il y a du vin italien et californien et c'est tout ... 
le service était parfait nous étions quand même une table de 30 personnes donc ils ont assurés ! 
La facture un peu élevé à la fin mais bon la qualité est là rassurez vous"}
{"text":"How am I the first to review Bice?  

Well, I'll do what I can to help you Montreal.  We had a great Italian meal on their lovely canopied patio.  

We started with the Spinach salad with figs, feta cheese, walnuts and prosciutto and mustard-honey vinaigrette.  This was a good salad and a nice start to our meal.  For our mains my wife had the home made chitarrucci, fresh lobster and lightly spiced seasonal mushrooms and she loved it.  I got the linguine with garlic, mussels and clams, which was excellent.  These dishes both went well with the great bottle of Italian wine Kris chose from their list.  On our waiter's suggestion we got the Hazelnut budino, chocolate and banana ice cream, frangelico crème anglaise for dessert.  It was chocolaty heaven and a perfect ending to a great meal.  

Our service was very good as well.  I even got to talk hoops and bash LeBron with one of the servers in the know.  Excellent people watching too, reminded me of Chicago's Viagra Triangle."}
{"text":"We are considering Bice to cater our wedding in the Fall. Because it was the holiday season and they were too booked up to do a tasting, we decided to try out their restaurant.

7pm on a Tuesday night and the restaurant was relatively quiet for the holiday season. We arrived a bit early and wanted to get a drink at the bar which is located near the back end of the restaurant. The bartender was clueless and when I asked her for a cocktail menu she immediately said they didn't have one. The manager gave her an odd look and then she said \"oops yes we do actually have one\" and handed it to me. I had a nice glass of red wine (pricey!) and bf had beer. 

We were escorted to our table and immediately given a pretty plate of bruschetta and 3 dips. (see pics) I loved the garlicy one! I think this is a complimentary dish they give customers as I saw everyone getting them.

I ordered a pasta dish (to test out for the wedding) and he ordered the filet mignon. The pasta was average- a bit oily and nothing special. He enjoyed his filet mignon, but nothing TOO special. The portion was really large which was surprising.

After our main courses, the waiter came out and gave us complimentary \"the grand finale\" which was amazing! There was two of each of their desserts: creme brulee, chocolate souffle, chocolate ganache, etc. Just delicious! 

The presentation of the dishes was lovely but the food lacked quality and flavour for the reputation Bice holds. However, the dessert was to die for! 

Note- Bice's catering menu is apparently very different from the restaurant. Will update after our tasting in March."}
{"text":"The best squid ink pasta I've ever had. Gorgeous presentation and absolutely delicious. But as exceptional as the main course was, the cannoli was the highlight of my meal. Fresh, crispy and creamy-superb! The ambiance and decor is also quite lovely. I loved the open air concept. I wish I lived in Montreal bc if I did I'd be a frequent customer."}
{"text":"Most gorgeous terasse in Montreal in my humble opinion 
The decor and lightening reminds me of an outdoor Californian wedding 
I went in the winter and summer and it was both charming. 
I had the oysters, tuna tartar, filet mignon, octopus, parpadelle. 
Everything was really good. The first time the filet mignon was amazing but the second time wasn't as good. I can't put my finger on why, perhaps it was overcooked.
The wine list is very good. 
The service is really attentive. 
This place is perfect for a romantic date or a night out with friends."}
{"text":"I had the most amazing experience at Bice this past weekend. We were visiting from San Francisco for a bday celebration. My sister in law made a reso months ago, 8 people.. She forgot to ask for patio seating, while they told us it wasn't available, we arrived and were surprised that indeed we were to be seated outside in the lovely patio. The ambiance was amazing - everything about this place was exquisite. We started with a few apps: Calamari, octupus, crab cakes, tuna tartare, carpaccio and the beat salad. While the crab cake was the winner, all others were fantastic as well. BTW- we're a party of 10 and all are big eaters.. 

My main enteree was the Chilean Sea bass, my hubby ordered the lobster linguine. I dont recall what else was ordered, but I can certainly say that all dishes were sent back empty and we all make several comments throughout the meal on how delicious it all was. 

For our dessert - we ordered the sampler: Ice cream, cheesecake, creme brulee, chocolate lava cake, bread pudding and fruit. I would absolutely recommend that you order the same should you desire dessert. 

The service was impeccable. Our waiter was attentive and kind.. 

I'm unsure when I'll be bank in Montreal, but one things for sure.. Bice will be on the agenda.."}
{"text":"I came to Bice for a wedding reception and frankly it's a beautiful resto with a huge terrace that is quite aesthetically pleasing. The entrance was converted for the reception to a cocktail party and then afterwards into a dance floor. The music was great!

What stood out for me was the service, it was impeccable! The staff was fantastic all night long, accommodating and friendly. My glass of water was never less than half full. The waiters walked around at the start of the evening with glasses of champagne and a wide variety of goodies. I particularly enjoyed the lamb.

As for Italian restos go, we have to take into consideration that Bice is gastronomic first and foremost. If you're coming here for dinner, don't expect your traditional Italian experience with a small \"Casa Di Mama\" resto but rather the work of a renowned chef performing his trade. So, expect beautiful plates that are hopefully big on flavor and beauty but rather small on portion size. You can also expect this experience to make more of an impact to your wallet but as I was a guest, the only thing that came out of my wallet was the donation I made to the bride and groom.

I went with their octopus for an appetizer, their gnocchi and then the filet mignon (not a fan of fish as it was the only other option!). Overall, I was thought they were OK but nothing that would make me want to come back, particularly at the price-tag that they ask for. 

The octopus was alright but once again, quite tiny in a very lovely huge plate. Something was in it that didn't make me like it very much.

The gnocchi was good and the serving was a bit more generous than the octopus but I've enjoyed far better. The sauce was in particular was average. 

The biggest disappointment was the filet mignon. Filet mignon to me doesn't hold much flavor due to it having no fat on it. It was classic back in the day that sadly still lives to its reputation and obviously it's expensive due to it. Insane! It's simply not a flavorful piece of meat on its own to me. If it was wrapped/under something fatty (such as bacon or cheese) to enhance the flavor it would be better but alas, it wasn't. An unimaginative slab of meat was served. Fat is good people, especially on meats, try it!!!

All in all, there are simply much better cuts of meat out there.

I'd give the food a 3 and the service and decor a 5."}
{"text":"I thought I already found THE perfect italian restaurant in Montreal but after eating at Beatrice, I don't think I can ever find an italian restaurant at that level. The pasta is al dente,  the food is amaaaazing. There's plenty parking spot and/or valet parking. The staff is very friendly. The vibe is so romantic and chic. Absolutely incredible!!"}
{"text":"This was AN EXPERIENCE. The hostess was so nice felt welcome and at home. The menu was very interesting. Had the pulpo , the pasta with wild mushrooms (as pictured) and an ice cream cake with salted caramel pop corn for dessert. Lets take a minute and talk about their homemade bread and pasta *DROOLING* however its on the pricier side but if you want to splurge, look no further go to beatrice :)"}
{"text":"A decent place for lunch if you are in the downtown area. $25 for a decent three course meal is not bad. The guy who greeted us seems aloof but the waiter is quite friendly. I think the food is okay, but not impressive. My wife said she certainly would not want to come back."}
{"text":"I've come by many times in front of Ristorante Béatrice and always thought it looked absolutely gorgeous. Today at lunch was the time to finally try it. 
I was right, it is absolutely gorgeous. It's bright and shiny décor with neutral color and lovely light arrangements. It is quite classy and chic with even a tree in the corner. I've heard the terrace is fantastic but the cold winter storm outside was not ideal for that. I'll try it another time 
4 course meal:
A creamy, lovely Mozzarella di buffala with fresh tomatoes, pesto, tasty olive oil and crispy bread was the first course. And it started out strong. I was not hungry anymore after this first plate. Very traditional but very well done. The olive oil was really bringing the dish together.
Next was a plate of fresh tomato pasta. It might seem simple and ordinary like that but it was seriously one of the best tomato spaghetti I had. There was a superb depth of taste.
Main course was veal and a mushroom sauce which was fantastic with the brunellos I had in my glass. Italian wine with Italian food ;) It wasn't as fresh and delicious as the first two but it was still very pleasant.
Then we had a huge plate of sweets. It seems they have a pastry chef of their own which is quite rare nowadays. Cream cheese and white chocolate ball was to die for. The cookies were delicious. A very cute lemon meringue mini pie. Brownie, cake, fruits, etc. So much stuff!!
This is what Italian restaurant should be like, classy with good typical ingredients."}
{"text":"Very good food, excellent service, and decent decor- I could do without the sort of EQ3 furniture and soulless catalogue feeling, but a nice ambiance nonetheless. 

The service was very impressive for a large restaurant- drinks were refilled attentively and waiters were friendly and knowledge despite being a primarily English speaker (more than I can say for most Québécois restaurants). Beatrice really excels in service and we had a lovely evening here."}
{"text":"wow what a place! The food is great, and no complaints. The price is really high! The decor is authentic, and the staff is very friendly. If your lucky you might catch a a celebrity  eating there! 

Bice is great for couples, and a romantic evening. Don't bring kids here, its a slow service, were you get to enjoy your time and talk. This is more of a \"adult only\" place."}
{"text":"The food is okay but not special. The wine prices are ridiculous. In the end, this is a restaurant that takes itself far too seriously."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and amazing food. If you're looking for a lovely and romantic place for a date, this is the place !! Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"It had been awhile since I had gone so when business partners were coming to Montreal on a cold night in October, my first thought was Beatrice's lovely terrace.
By all accounts, the restaurant still holds the torch on fine dining. My companions all loved every course they had. Everything in the menu is inviting (at least to my taste). My grilled octopus was delicious. The spaghetti vongole is some of the best in Montreal. I recommended the first timers at the table to start with an appetizer portion of pasta followed by a meat or fish. The food was plenty. Bravo to the team at Beatrice. I won't wait so long to return."}
{"text":"What a beautiful looking restaurant with lights hanging from the ceiling, and a good looking crowd to boot. Service was friendly and attentive. The burrata, mushroom pasta, Brussel sprouts and sorbet dessert were all tasty. It's a trendy restaurant, but it's worth it for a special treat."}
{"text":"One of the many top restaurants in Montreal.  Somewhat pricey but they come through on all the key elements: food, service and atmosphere. I had the pasta with sausage. It was fantastic. Pasta was perfectly cooked and the red sauce divine. My wife had something that was not on the menu; the veal.  The best we have ever had!  

The service was 4 star. A little slow but they were dealing with two parties of 20 plus. They did a great job of catering to our needs without being annoying. 

Lastly, the atmosphere was 5 star. Make sure you request outside seating. It's a great outdoor area. 

All in all, well worth the price."}
{"text":"Whoa!  Best squid-ink pasta I've ever had. Can't wait to return. Service was amazing. Started with a Caesar salad, followed by a beef carpacio with a sprinkling of truffle oil and freshly squeezed lemon juice. Decadently scrumptious and fresh. Perfect meal."}
{"text":"What a first class experience! Each and every time I've been here, the service and food have been excellent. The perfect spot for an intimate date night... the terrace is insane."}
{"text":"Food was ok, wasn't worth the high price. Service was terrible and almost nonexistent. My wife ordered the seafood risotto and it was undercooked. Had to ask for bread for the table and they never brought any butter or olive oil. It seemed like the waiters and owners catered to friends and people they knew and completely ignored everyone else. I saw several other dissatisfied customers around me. The atmosphere was dull and they played a house music loop that made you want to fall asleep. I come from the NYC/NJ area so I am used to very good Italian food.. and this food was average and the service was amateur. Don't waste your time or your money.. unless you like \"ok\" Italian food and being ignored for a very high price."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. 
That's what comes to mind first, and the main reason I wanted to try this place, and wow it didn't disappoint. Just for the decor alone this place is worth the visit. Their lunch menu is very affordable (25$ for an entree - main - and dessert) while the evening menu is standard (35-50$) and the service was very friendly. Absolutely perfect for a date or a special occasion."}
{"text":"As good as it gets!  We are world travelers and experienced haute cuisine in a number of places.  Beatrice is outstanding.  Service attentive but not overbearing.  Food superb - pastas outstanding, appetizers classic with a twist.  Best restaurant during our recent visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner one night when hubby and myself had a (dirty)
weekend getaway/ Anniversary in Montreal.  I say dirty because we pretty much sullied our regularly disciplined diets with red meat (The Horror!) via Montreal smoked sandwiches and decadent Italian fare thanks to Bice.

  It's a gorgeous resto with an impressive array of beautiful fresh flower arrangements throughout which really blew me away. We got seated on the spacious patio in front of the topiary-esque festooned wall of greenery. The clientele was a little Euro-trash but I myself was tricked out in painful blister-worthy Louboutins and a bodycon dress so I guess, I looked appropriately \"goomar-ish\"!  Hey I figure I'm in Montreal might as well tramp it up!

Quite surprisingly, for a restaurant chain, Bice's food is absolutely belissima! Fresh and flavourful and what you'd expect upscale Italian cuisine to be.  For our antipasti we shared the fried crab cake with lime and black pepper mayo, grilled corn, cucumber and coriander salsa.  Twas so good that hubby bogarted two of the three crab cakes.  For our mains I ordered the Braised veal agnolotti with wild mushroom sauce, which was divine, while hubby got the Blackened tuna with almond-olive and lemon vinaigrette, grated fresh horseradish, roasted Brussels sprouts and king eryngii mushrooms. To polish off our dinner we shared a delectable Chocolate lava cake.

Forget about \"Just for Laughs\" we had our very own entertainment right here at Bice!  Between me inconspicuously eyeballing the saucy waiters ( who btw didn't give a toss about me, but were quite taken with my hubby!) and us watching the resto manager failing miserably at trying to pick up the attractive lesbian couple dining beside us (c'mon guy, really?) we had a blast!

Yes it was pricey, about $225 with tip included  for two apps, two mains, dessert ,champagne, beer and a Macallen single malt  but this was my anniversary dinner dammit!  Besides I think hubby brilliantly chose Bice for our seductively ,epicurean meal to butter me up so he could get lucky later that nite ;)

When in Montreal and when you are craving Italian gastronomic decadence that could put a Fellini film to shame,  I encourage you experience La Dolce Vita at Bice Restaurant."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for our six month anniversary. I've been wanting to try this place for a long time now so I was excited to go and have a romantic date night. The resto is so cute! I like the lights everywhere, the one wall of what looks like fake grass and the tree in front that has become part of the establishment. When she showed up the ceiling was partially opened and then they closed it because it was too cold. On a warm summer night I think it would be very romantic to look up at the sky.
I had a bloody Caesar and my boyfriend had a gin tonic. We shared the burrata with proscuitto, basil pesto, country bread and  tomatoes. I had the tagliolini pasta with lobster. It was good. I hate to compare but I prefer the lobster pasta at Joe beef. My boyfriend had the grilled 20 oz. rib steak with homemade fries. It was so charred!! It was black on the outside but the inside was OK. I took a bite and I felt so bad for my boyfriend. I told the waiter the steak was burnt and he was nice enough to bring another one and that one was better. I usually never send fold back but it wasn't a cheap steak and I didn't want the guy to eat a steak he wasn't enjoying. I almost gave this resto three stars but because in the end they redeemed themselves I gave them four stars. 
I really had high hopes for this resto but I  probably will not come back."}
{"text":"FOod and ambience perfect !!!! :) went there on a weekday for lunch with my love   and they serve lunch on most weekends for 25$ for a three course meal :) ! It's more than worth for the quality of the food they served!"}
{"text":"When passing by Sherbrook, I always become curious and have been wanting to visit this restaurant. So I had big \"yes!\" when my friend asked me to hang out for a lunch- it serves a three-course meal at $25 on weekdays! 

Not surprisingly, the ambiance was fancy and quite. It will be a perfect spot for a romantic dinner, but also for a lunch with a business meeting. I thought the openness widening the whole view as one would be perfect for events such as a wedding reception. 

The service was well-sophisticated - not overly strong and kind (such as sometimes stopping on-going conversations on the table by explaining the menu), very appropriate, in terms of full - caring of tables but not driving unnecessary attention.

The only downside may be the food. (Alert! I am not fair - as I paid only $25 for the three-course meal. ) The taste was OK, not super, super delicious but can definitely say above average. I had Kale salad, duck breast, and a chocolate cake. The duck meat was kind of cold (not freshly served right after cooking) as if I get the steaks somewhere an event is going (the food is prepared in advance). I could imagine that the food must have been very tasty if it served after cooking right away. 

As I said before, I'm not fair as the food taste was way beyond of my expectation with a payment of $25 in downtown Montreal. Good ambiance and service is a plus.  I just wanted to be honest and bring some information, the above comment on the food is not a complaint. It's still worth visit, and I'm actually planning to revisit this place for other occasions."}
{"text":"bon , classique et frais . Restaurant au beau décor élégant , idéal pour des rendez vous d affaires au lunch . Bon service également . J'ai adoré le gateau de morue. La petite crème brûlée mériterait un peu plus de vanille plutôt que d un beignet ."}
{"text":"They are good at refilling the water. 
Very elegant restaurant. 
Service was impressive. 
We were a large group of about 23 people and they were very accommodating. Didn't force us to order a la carte. Were quick to take our orders and bring out the food. And gave separate bills. Also they put us on a large table that was wide and not just long, so you can see everyone. I thought that was nice. 
They forgot to bring my rose wine. 
I got the veal which was good and sizable. It's a very very thin piece of meat covered in arugula salad. 
My hubby got the filet mignon which was delicious but small. 
It's a pricey restaurant. 
They have valet parking."}
{"text":"Visiting from Los Angeles, and to be honest, it's been tough finding a restaurant that meets our high foodie standards. Until we tried this place! You guys, this spot is amazing. Here are the reasons why: 

1. Ambience. Mood lighting; romantic setting; with great music in the background. 
2. Decor. The walls, the lighting, the tables, everything. Top quality. 
3. The food!! Beyond amazing. We had the Burrata to start, which was phenomenal. Our entrees were perfection. And for dessert, we went with the recommended cannoli. It comes with 3 per order, and my husband and I devoured it within a minute. Beyond amazing. The filling was perfect consistency, and the flavor was the best I've ever had. 
4. Customer Service. We've been here for 6 days, and this was the only spot that understood what real customer experience means. Definitely felt like everyone there cared about their craft. 

I can go on and on. My fave spot in Montreal hands down. I wish I can take this restaurant back with me to LA. Trust me, you have to eat here! I'm so surprised they don't have more reviews!"}
