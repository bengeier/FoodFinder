{"text":"This place was good was worth the stop. After a long Golf game, looking for something healthier to eat than pizza or a burger; it offered us a variety of different sushi's at a reasonable price. The services was quick and friendly and the sushi was very tasty with a lot of variety and speciality. 3 guys at about 18 pieces each came to about 42 dollars with tax and tip. It's a BYOW, also a nice touch."}
