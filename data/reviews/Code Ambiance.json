{"text":"J'y suis aller pour souper avec ma conjointe et nous avons eu une très belle expérience. Le menu \"détente\" que j'ai choisi était très bon, les saveurs étaient très inédites surtout pour ce qui est du cur de veau. La morue de mon plat principal était une des meilleures que j'ai mangé, une cuisson parfaite! Le service était courtois et les vins conseillés mon paru tout à fait appropriés."}
{"text":"I had the seafood couscous. A very generous portion of salmon, turbot, scallops, and shrimp in a tomato sauce topped over couscous. Yes, couscous is like a sponge and will absorb anything - like my four year old nephew who I once called \"booger-face\", who then wouldn't shut up and called everyone and everything \"booger-face\" for an entire week. So if the couscous is going to absorb everything, I'm glad the chef at Code Ambiance made sure what they were ladling on was delicious."}
{"text":"PLEASE DO NOT WASTE UR TIME AND MONEY THERE! 

Owners really don't know how to do business and they were super snob! 

it was crap"}
{"text":"Bad Ambiance.  My wife and I visit Montreal several times each year to visit family, and one of the things we love the most about the city are the great restaurants and friendly people.  We heard good things about this restaurant so decided to go check it out.  Showed up and found the restaurant to be very conveniently located close to our house, and was totally empty except one couple dining in the front.  However, we were turned away from the restaurant as we had our two young girls with us, and the host told my five year old to \"hurry and grow up\".  Seriously?  They actually turned us away despite having a totally empty restaurant?  Wow, how rude.  We then somehow ended up at \"Casa de Mateo\" in Old Montreal and had one of the best mexican dinners in years.  We usually hate the cheasy Mariachi band, but these guys were ridiculously good and very friendly.  I would definately avoid L'ambiance.  Unless you like to be treated like dirt."}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner at Code.
I knew the former restaurant and a little hesitant in the beginning because of location . Pleased to say, once inside, it was warm and inviting.

Waiter was funny with his dry sense of humour and flowed with an evening of birthday partying.
Food was very good and tasted a black rice that was delicious.
Had the duck tartar, raw meat, excellent!!!! As well as lamb raviolis.
Wine by the glass was a little expensive @ $12.00 per not so large glass. 
Decor is modern but warm and  enough textures to absorb any noise , so no problem hearing each other throughout the evening. Too bad they don't have a terrace .

Unlike former reviewer, they allowed a personal cake from the outside but insisted the portions be cut in the kitchen after I cut the first slice.
Will go back. Too"}
{"text":"Super Resto!

Super accord Mets et vin, servi par le propriétaire.

Un de mes meilleurs Resto!

Je le recommande fortement."}
{"text":"This is probably the best in urban chic cuisine I have experienced. Impeccable service by the owner, whose passion for food is palpable and enticing. The most unusual flavor combinations, a refined use of spices and the best fresh ingredients make for a perfect recipe for an extraordinary menu. Among other more traditional items, delicious tartar dishes are the cornerstone of an amazing culinary experience. For the first time, I tried the lamb tartare which was perfectly spiced yet allowing the lamb taste to come through. But it gets better.... Much better. The apple tart Tatin with pan seared foie gras is the epitome of a perfect marriage between sweet and savory. The perfectly seared generous foie gras portion served on top of a delicious butter caramel Tatin tart makes for the ultimate contrast in texture and flavors. The wine list is also carefully crafted and the owner provides great wine pairing suggestion. This little quaint restaurant has been in business for 11 years and deserves to be here forever more. A MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"The food here is French cuisine, nothing truly inspired but nicely done and well presented. The decor is interesting with salvaged tables and chairs that in some ways are in keeping with the food, but in other ways seem a little too hippyish. The owner however is an anxious type and her customer service leaves much to be desired. Several good wines are offered by the glass, which is nice, and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed coming here. Not too crowded or busy, just right to decompress and enjoy some good French food. The wine selection is quite good. The usual waiter knows his stuff. And there is enough selection, vegetarian included, to satisfy most palettes. There is also some stuff to snack on if you just want wine and a little something. For me, it's just perfect.

Oh and by the way, the owners have changed. It is now Bastien ? He is the new owner. Really nice guy."}
{"text":"Situé au cur du quartier des antiquaires de Montréal. L'Ambiance avec son décor moderne se rattache au quartier avec quelques objets intéressants. Par exemple caisse enregistreuse remarquable. Son style en fait un endroit de choix pour un dîner d'affaires ou un petit tête à tête. 

Le menu est limité avec quelques choix du jour. La nourriture d'un style européen y est succulente. On y sert une sélection correcte de vin et de spiritueux."}
{"text":"It was my friend's birthday so I wanted fine cuisine to make it memorable.  She chose Code Ambiance among the options I gave her.  We were the only people at the restaurant during a weekday evening.  It was great, we had the waiter at our service.  The salmon tartar was good, but a bit pricey for what it tasted.  The special of the day was shrimp pilaf.  Again, it was good but I expected a bit more.  There's a wide selection of wine at your disposal.  The creme brulé was a little too bruléd and the top was crusty and slightly bitter."}
