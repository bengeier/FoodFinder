{"text":"Perfect for neighborhood dive. 24 hour food, cheap strong drinks.  Gina and Jonah always take care of their customers.  Plus I can walk there so 5 stars from me"}
{"text":"I recently gave Goldfinger's another try.  My positive was the waiter on the food side. Anthony.  He was polite and attentive.  The food was your standard bar fare.  Would I go back??? Only because of Anthony.  Next I'll try breakfast."}
{"text":"I used to like Goldfinger's quite a bit. Within walking distance of my house, i'd go every couple of months with my MIL for late-night food and a bit of gambling. At 1am, the bar is pretty decent, and i've actually hit a jackpot or 2, a very nice addition. In fact,  I give them an extra star for the $800 I won there one night!  The food's been changed, and not in a positive way. This has been recent, say in the past 6 months. One of the best items they served was a steak and eggs graveyard special, and it was unique. It has a Mexican twist to it, the meat was marinated in a very delicious, unusual blend of spices. It made the meat very tender and delicious. Not anymore! It's a sub-standard, just salt and pepper steak of ill-repute. NOT GOOD. I used to love eating that steak!  Thry do have Blue Moon beer on tap, so that's worth something, I guess."}
{"text":"Gina, Randy, Alissa and Jonas are all terrific!!! I have gone there for over 7 years now and I like the atmosphere and the exceptional service!"}
{"text":"I went back for breakfast and it was great!  Anthony was working again and was in excellent form. Much busier this time. I would also like to share that the lady bartender is gone!  The bartender working this day was Randy, what a pro. Made me feel really welcome!  Putting this place back on my list!"}
{"text":"The draft beer is about $5.25 for a huge mug and the bbq western burger is the shizznit!!!! Nice quite little bar, every time i walk in Gina is the bartender and she immediately gets my blue moon draft ready without me even saying anything."}
{"text":"A nice clean neighborhood bar.  There is gaming which can be a little smoky but that is to be expected, there is a smoke free dinning area as well.   You can't through a rock without hitting a gaming bar in this town.  For me it is all about the quality of food and service.  This is one of the few places I would come just to eat as opposed drink and gamble.  Breakfast is a dam good value, very tasty bacon.  Chicken Wings are nice and Crispy.  The only desert offered is truly decadent Fried Oreos, with ice cream.  If you have the late night munchies have the beer battered onion rings, and fried oreos for desert.  They have nachos that kick ass over this other place daddy something or other.  I like the mellow vibe of the place.  Gina is a very personable and was kind enough to remember me after only one visit."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Vegas...started going a few years back when I was new to the area n gina made me feel right at home. I enjoy her quick wit, excellent customer service N most Importantly her friendship. Over the years we became close enough that I invited her to my wedding.  She's a great person inside and out !!!  Busy or slow she mans the bar like a well oiled machine :) The food is always good, but I wish they'd bring back the eggplant ! Great place to have a meal, watch a game or just have a few drinks with friends. .."}
{"text":"This bar is awesome. Stopped in with several friend after a late busy night at work. Great food awesome service and a overall great vibe. Unfortunately bar is a bit of a drive from my house. But I will definitely return. Darren was on point."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food. It's alot of food! Love love love the sausage egg n chz croissant."}
{"text":"I've never been here in the evening so I wouldn't know how horrible Jenni the bartender is. I usually go on the late nights and the overnight  bartenders are cool as hell. It is usually one of the guys. The late night specials are half off all appetizer's, and seeing that the most expensive appetizer during regular hours is 8 dollars, the late night app's are quite a bargain. I ordered the chicken nachos. When they came out it looks like 2 pounds of food coming out. The corn tortilla chips taste house made, and is topped with melted shredded cheese, olives, tomatoes, beans, and chicken. Oh, but the best part is that it's also topped with fresh chopped jalapeno's, Yum-o. Served alongside sour cream and salsa. After being stuffed I saw the bill and it came out to 4.02. Great late night meal deal!"}
{"text":"Gina is a HUGE part of why we come here. She started off as a great bartender and has grown into an even better friend. Can't say enough about her!"}
{"text":"This is the worst local bar in las vegas!  They have horrible service and you can't even cuss.  Never go there."}
{"text":"Good local bar with cold beer. I don't like how smokey it can get in there they need to update filter system."}
{"text":"Always a good time! Love that it's never really busy late at night and food tastes pretty good!! Good sized servings for cheap! Machines are also newer which is a plus. Bartenders are always in a great mood and will chat with you if you are by yourself!"}
{"text":"We have been coming in here for over 2 years now. When we started coming in the service was great every time.. It is still great during Aprils grave shifts. But the past several times of going in on a swing shift that Gina is working is very uncomfortable. She has a bad attitude, is rude, and short with us. I have never asked for or expected anything free. I always ask for a check , ALWAYS!!! Last night I was greeted with \"You have to play a total of 5 coins for a drink\" . That was the rudest greeting I have ever revived  any place I have ever gone. The fact that my husband and I have always taken good care of the bartenders there, and never even implied that we wanted anything for free. My husband plays quite a bit and usually drinks nothing but water, so again the comment was just being nasty  & insulting for whatever reason.   Don't worry Gina we wont be back on your shift!"}
{"text":"No stars! Two boners down!! This place is terrible and depressing. A \"free drink\" if you are playing any games will cost you at least $40. Just buy the drinks, or even better... Go somewhere else, their machines never pay out. You probably have better chances playing megabucks or lottery tickets."}
{"text":"I know it's a bar but everyone is super nice ! And the food is very good,  great burgers and fries at a very reasonable price. The beer is cold and they have a great selection. When you go in its never very busy don't let this deter you. Very clean and lots of TVs to watch sports and its just a nice place ."}
{"text":"Major plus is that it's open 24 hours and if I ever decided to get really drunk, I could walk home, it's that close to my house.  I work nights so I like to treat myself to their steak and eggs at 4 a.m. Hits the spot. I'm very picky about my order and the cooks have always gotten it right, the first time. Their omelets are also fantastic. heck, everything I've eaten there has been fantastic.   The waiters and waitresses have always been super attentive, more so than most other places I've been to. I drink a lot of water and iced tea, and my glass has never been empty there. The food comes out really quick and piping hot.  When you've just worked a 14-hour shift, the last thing you want to do is deal with a waitress with an attitude or food that takes too long. Neither have ever been a problem here.    I only have two complaints.   First, the dining area is plexiglassed off from the bar area in an effort to keep diners away from smoke.  But the very stale air in the dining area still smells of cigarette smoke. The air doesn't look smoky. But you can definitely smell it. Since I am highly allergic, I usually end up getting a headache before I leave which lasts for a couple of hours. Big bummer. They really need to air it out for a couple days and then get a huge hose with Febreze and spray it all down.  Second, the lack of desserts. The fried Oreos are delicious, but sometimes I just want to have pie ala mode or good old fashioned carrot cake or chocolate cake or cheesecake after a meal. It seems like it wouldn't be too hard to get more desserts in there. That would make those of us with a sweet tooth very very happy.   Other than those two problems, I really enjoy going there. And will continue to do so.  I hope the owner takes suggestions to heart. Then i wouldn't hesitate to give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Not a bad bar, not a great one either. Always same people I see everytime I go.  Wish they had better drink specials and more choices on food. Probably will return because its close to home."}
{"text":"I love Gina!! She cracks me up and never leaves you empty!! Great service! If you can make it in during the day, go see Alissa! She is fabulous, friendly and very attentive! Both of these girls are why we drive across town!!"}
{"text":"This place is walking distance from my house and I wasn't in the mood to cook so I called in an order of food to be picked up. When I walked in to the bar the lady behind the counter shouted, \"Are you even old enough to be here\" instead of \"Hey, hows it going? Can I please see your id\" Since I was walking I didn't bring my whole purse just the money I needed and she made me walk to the restaurant side of the bar just to pay and hand me my bag. I really had no problem moving since I didn't have an id to provide however I don't appreciate the customer service skills. As for the food the fries were pretty good but I can't really recommend anything else. I will probably try this again since it is so close but my expectations will stay low."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar and awesome bartenders.  I've been going in for 10+ years and it's reassuring to have consistently great food  and drinks served by the same smiling faces..... Gina is amazing and the main reason I continue to visit every week. I'm not sure what Jen and her boyfriend experienced but it's not what the rest of us see everyday.  The great news is there are 10 bars in a 3 mile radius so hopefully the people who are searching for the right place find it ..... I found my local watering hole and It's Goldfingers .....love my G"}
{"text":"My wife and I have breakfast there every week. We shopped around but no one matches the French toast at goldfingers.  I also recommend the pancake sandwich.  The lunch/ dinner options are ok but the breakfast is elite."}
{"text":"Came in here quite a few times over the past 6 months and jonas is always on point. Good bartender never leaves your glass empty and remembers what you drink. Food is good and recommendations are always good.  When you want a good conversation hes a good guy to chat with."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that you go to and at the end of your meal you say to yourself \"I'm never coming back here again\" and then a year later you think- Hmm...maybe they've improved so you go back and then at the end of your meal it happens just like in the Lion King - The Circle of life- your  thoughts from a year ago come back to haunt you or dare I say bite you in the ass.... The food is just Whatever.... It's like they went out and bought a bunch of frozen stuff at Sam's or Costco's and then prepared it. I thought I was picking something special when I ordered the Chicken Cordon Blu. Basically if you don't know what that is- it's breaded chicken breast stuffed with ham and cheese and then deep fried. This dish is served with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. Sounds good huh? Well, like I said I truly believe this dish came from Sam's.  Aside from the bar side we were the only people in the dining area and the food took 20 min. (My dish, cheeseburger & an order of fries) The waitress clearly worked an extra shift or was asked to come in on her day off cause she did not want to be there, we saw it all over her face.  After a meal I hate asking myself  - \"Why did I waste my money and calorie intake at this place?\" So kids,the moral of the story is that life doesn't have to be a circle- if a place is not satisfying once, it's most likely not  going to be satisfying again."}
{"text":"We went to watch the hockey game and in three hours my beer was empty for at least an hour. I one point we watched the bartender rand walked by 13 times without asking if I need anything."}
{"text":"I live around the corner from this place and I have been there several times. There is nothing particularly wrong with this place, it is a very respectable local bar. The late night food is fine, and the staff is perfectly enthusiastic. However, there is never anyone there!  Nobody.  Hello-o-o-o  How does this place stay open? I'm sure the people from the surrounding blocks frequent this place after their second DUI arrest or when their wives go to sleep. But I never see them. What is going on?!  I'm not expecting a meat market where girls dance on the bar. But, it would be nice to see another human being."}
{"text":"Great service. Friendly staff and good drinks. Not over priced. Located in my area and a short walk from home. This place can definitely help after a long day"}
{"text":"I looooovvvveee goldfingers and Gina is the best! My boyfriend and I go in about 2-3 times a week depending, but we like to go when Gina is there, she's such a sweetheart and She knows right when we walk in the door what kind of beer we both want and to get menus for us, their food is great and super reasonably priced my boyfriend always gets the black and Bleu burger and I love the wings there but I've pretty much tried it all and NEVER been disappointed also the deep fried oreos are amazing! Gina is a legit bartender and knows and loves her regulars as well as every customer that comes in. If u write a bad review about this bar or Gina herself then u must have been the problem. there's always 2 sides to everystory. Don't act a fool in someone else's business then blame your bad experience on them! This truly is an awesome and affordable neighborhood establishment!"}
{"text":"Overall, not a bad place to hang out.  The chicken taco's are VERY good!  The reason for the 3 stars is the machines.  All of them are 10+ quarters on poker.  No keno or slots.  If you are not winning, your money goes quick here.  And, I have never won once in this joint (went 5 times).  If you go, just don't gamble here.  Eat breakfast in the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is so great! I've been here a few times (as I live 30 seconds away.) they never fail to deliver. Food is great, service is amazing, and the cold beer is served in chilled mugs. I only wish the music could rotate to something a little more \"modern\" or maybe a mix? Dope place though!!"}
{"text":"Jenni is obviously unhappy at her job. I watched her on evening be rude to just about everyone. We are talking only 5 people there and she.coulnd stand anyine. She acts as though it is very annoying to have to serve you. She treated my food order like a major chore. I am sure management will.catch on. The food isnt very good so if the service is borderline abusive..... Well im sure business will be showing.a decrease.in sales. I for one will NEVER return."}
{"text":"I've never tried anything but the fries and beer and I'm fine with keeping it that way. I just come to watch football anyways."}
{"text":"Always enjoy sunday morning football here.   Gaming specials where you can win alcohol and NFL Jerseys :)"}
{"text":"Great place to play and eat. The bartender Eric at night is a excellent bartender. He is very friendly and professional! We will be coming back regularly. Also the nachos looked amazing we did not have them this time but we will be trying them on our next visit!"}
