{"text":"Saw this had a high rating on yelp so I thought I would try it out.  Went there for lunch, they had a fair price on 2 slices and a drink ($5.50).  The pizza was lousy, had plenty of cheese but ZERO taste.  I had to add parm, salt and pepper just to give it some taste.  Don't waste your time or money...go to el vallarta next door for some great and good priced mexican"}
{"text":"Pizza was very good. It was alittle slow to come out, but they made it fresh. They even throw the dough in the air. It was the first visit for us and we will be back."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant on Friday.  The service was exceedingly quick and the food was high quality.  This is not just another Pizza Restaurant.  It is top-notch and the customer service is hard to beat.  If you really want New York Style Pizza, visit Michael Angelo's Pizza House, Monroe.  It is a taste and service that is hard to beat."}
{"text":"I walked into michael Angelo's pizza today because it is close to my house and not a chain pizza factory...I was a little skeptical due to the fact that the soda fridges were bare with only one row of diet coke cans and only 4 slices of regular and two of something else in the display case so I ordered one slice to see how it was and I have to say it was one of the closest to new York pizza that I've had here in the south
The slice I got was a little lacking in sauce but jam packed with cheese.... after I ate it I ordered a whole pie with extra sauce and my daughter said it tasted like NY pizza and my husband said wow this is pretty damn good! We will deffinately be getting pizza from here all the time.  I just hope they start putting different pizzas out so that they can be tasted"}
{"text":"This little eatery was impressive. Growing up on NYC pizza, few mainstream offerings satisfy me... Pizza Hut, Domino's, Little Caesars all miss the mark. Papa John's comes close. But then there was Michael Angelo's, right off 74 in mid-Monroe. Admittedly the strip which housed the restaurant was easy to drive past. Moreover, the restaurant itself was unassuming. [Not a big deal... most of New York's tastiest pizzerias aren't flashy either.] The highlights, however, were Michael Angelo's service and quality. Workers were efficient yet very conversational, and how they styled their pizzas was close to perfection as can be. Prices were more than justified, whether for a pie, single slice, sub, salad or special. Though sad Michael Angelo's closed, the new DeeJak's -- least in my opinion -- has filled his shoes and then some thus far..."}
