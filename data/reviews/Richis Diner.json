{"text":"This is about the 4th or 5th time we have driven out to eat at Nick's and we aren't prone to driving more than 3 or 4 miles to eat ANYwhere.  This place is amazing.  I grew up in the restaurant business and I am telling you, these guys are good.. CONSISTENTLY!  Their salads are excellent, fresh.. their fish and chips, BIG chunks of cod and great tartar sauce, BIG steak fries, and breakfasts are fabulous.  Omelette's are huge and packed.  REAL good place-- REASONable prices and nice lighting.. ambiance for the price.  GO.. you will be glad."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!!  Dinner here tonight rocked as usual.  Rueben is out of this world!  Tzatziki sauce to die for!  Quality food at a sensible price!  Keep it up Nick!"}
{"text":"Food was not bad. Had the friday fish fry. Resturant was warm on a hot day. Had flys at my table that wouldnt go away. The table wobbled all thru dinner. Staff was really friendly a attentive, five stars for them."}
{"text":"They just changed the name to Richi's Diner.  The cheese omelet was cool and flat and had such a tiny bit of cheese that it was completely tasteless.  The poratoes might have been good if they were warm.  I was very disappointed.   Waitress was good but the kitchen was very slow."}
{"text":"Love Nicks Dinner.
food is Delicious comming from the City of New york I give this Resturant A+
I had the chopped surline steak with mashed potatoes and vegies.It was real good.I And the Breakfasts 2 eggs any style and three Big sausages and two potato pancakes WOW.
YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS PLACE.     DENNIS MORGANLANDER
SURPRISE AZ"}
{"text":"I had breakfast there for the first time today. I got four slices of bacon that tasted bad, bacon strips  completely burnt and even worse had most likely been microwaved so it was like plastic. The breakfast potato was overcooked and dry, like eating a week old over baked potato, The toast was toasted on one side, does the toaster not work. The waitress had a bad attitude, She couldn't care less."}
{"text":"The waitress & the food was amazing. We had  the gyros and they were soooo good and also they give you big portions. Small diner but they make u feel at home & food is great. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"How greedy can you be Richi? When a person comes in with a Buy one Get one and they are alone, maybe there is a reason! Maybe their spouse recently died, maybe they have four kids and just wanted to eat alone or have somebody serve them for a change, maybe their son is in Afghanistan and they had a good memory at the diner with them, maybe the person they were going to treat couldn't show, maybe they are financially burdened and it's their birthday and they just wanted to treat them-self??? To NOT allow somebody to use a BOGO coupon is the GREEDIEST most selfish thing a restaurant could do! That was HORRIBLE for you not to let a person take one of the meals home. GREED! Hope you never need to ask for a kidney."}
{"text":"Awesome food and staff is friendly and nice! I enjoyed my meal and experience here! Tip try their gyros they're delicious!"}
{"text":"I was super excited about trying this place after months of trying to convince my boyfriend to try it. It was the biggest disappointment. I got biscuits and gravy with a side of potatoes. The gravy tastes like if was formed from powder, not flavor and all. The potatoes were more than bland, even after adding a pound of salt they still weren't satisfying. My boyfriend got 2 pork chops with eggs. The pork chop was dry. I couldn't get the taste of pure garlic out of my mouth after one bite. He did say the egg was good but then again you can't mess up a simple fried egg. Overall all this the waitress which I believe was the owner was not nice and we did not feel we were well taken care of. With that being said avoid nicks diner!"}
{"text":"Broccoli Soup was lumpy, had chunk \"gravy\" and no broccoli in it. It had a hard layer over the top. I told the manager when he asked how everything was and he started arguing with me! I didn't like the scene we were making so I agreed with him it was delicious so he would stop hovering over us. When ordering I had asked for fries but was flat out denied because it wasn't part of the chicken parmesan option for sides. The chicken was bland and the speghetti was wet and soupy. I did not want another scene so I just didn't eat. I live in surprise and will recommend to all my peers, co-workers neighbors and friends to avoid this \"eatery\" at all costs. Very sad establishment."}
{"text":"JUST PASS! DONT GO HERE! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! I have had some horrible experiences here. Food cones out sometimes hot and mostly cold. The customers are mostly old, Sun City folks so DO NOT TAKE KIDS! You will get crazily stared at! The service is horribly poor and the only reason they got this star is because of an OK Gyro. LEAVE HERE!"}
{"text":"Gyros are the best around here and great prices! Overall good family diner will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We love Richi's good food, best Friday night Fish. Reasonable prices and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Only been there for breakfast twice since I moved back from PA. We won't be going back anytime in the foreseeable future.  I remember their burgers being pretty good, so maybe it's just breakfast they can't handle. The first time,  both of our eggs were brown and way over cooked and the service was ok.  The second time the food was just not good and the service was non-existent. Trying to get refills on drinks is a nightmare. We did leave a tip both times,  but really shouldn't have.  I don't know how they have multiple locations...but I guess after living in PA for the last three years I must have gotten use to good diner food. I won't say I'll never ever go back,  but I might have to skip the breakfast and go for a burger."}
{"text":"Our family came here every time we visit arizona. This place it is good for family to came eat, and hang out in our short visit. I like this place."}
{"text":"So good I have eaten here 4 times in the past week.

All the classics breakfast items that all taste homemade. Same for lunch, I had the burger and fries and was not disappointed. 

Very good prices and I have not left hungry ."}
{"text":"Food is good! Service is slow don't go if your in a rush. Staff did not even know what some of them items were that was shocking. Preorder and pick it up. The sheer slow preparation time just not worth dining in."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try it for lunch because it was close to our home and we were hungry. I have eaten at their old location and was not impressed, but I hoped the new name and location would be an improvement. I ordered the meatloaf because I love meatloaf. The meatloaf was tasteless and the mashed potatoes were swimming in a brown gravy. Very unattractive presentation and the food was awful. My husband ordered eggs  over medium. 
The eggs were runny, so he ate the toast and said we were leaving. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, food was good. I have a picky eater type of family so everyone got to decide. Prices were good too! Made me feel like i was in a small town cafe which is awesome!"}
{"text":"Corned beef hash is awesome! The oatmeal is the best I've ever had. All the staff is friendly and food comes quick, even on a busy morning."}
{"text":"First impressions: Simple menu, small diner, a bit loud when crowded, friendly service, tad slow when busy, clean.

Food for thought: Food not overly salted or greasy, good value=good portions.

Tips: Get there early and/or be willing to wait a bit to be seated. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, friendly staff but they need to take the Chicken Salad Sandwich off the menu since it's never available. We have to drive out of our way to go to the other Nick's  to get it. We keep giving them a chance, but every single time it's \"sorry, we're out\". I mean, is there a rush on this stuff just before we arrive, or is it a huge chore to whip up a quick portion? Oh well, we'll probably try again in the future. 5th time's a charm? Fingers crossed."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time with the family.  Ordered fish and chips, spaghetti with meatballs, ceasar salad, and italian sandwich.  All of it was good, tasty, and fresh.  The service we got from the waitress?  Can't get any better.  She was very friendly, responsive, and patient.  The place was clean and welcoming.  The prices are reasonable with average portions!  Gave three stars only because we came back a second time and I ordered the beef kabob.  The kabob was a bit pricey considering the small amount of rice received with the meal and only 4 small pieces of beef (although tasty).  Overall, We will be returning as this place is a pretty good diner and will spread the news about this tiny gem."}
{"text":"Fast service excellent breakfast.  Can't ask for much more.  I hear they have burgers that are great, but I like a beer with my burger so I probably won't go there hence only 4 stars."}
{"text":"Our first time at this restaurant and we really like it. The service was good, all severs were very kind and  attentive. The food is good and the prices are right, I will rather do here than one of those chain restaurants for either breakfast or lunch. 

We will go back at this place and will recommend it to our friends."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times for breakfast.  Good portions. Great speedy service. The potatoe cakes are really good!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast great price and even better service. Biscuits and gravy are a hit and can't go wrong with simple bacon and eggs. Everything I've had so far is delicious."}
{"text":"First time at Nick's just a few days ago. Great breakfast and service! Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This spot was suggested by family members: Small corner strip mall diner, Walk in and seat yourself. It was pretty busy but we easily found a table. I ordered the Belgian Waffle w/ fresh Strawberries and coffee. I was unimpressed with the \"Belgian\" part of the waffle. It wasn't as thick with deep pockets as I was expecting. More importantly it was cold such that the individual butter pats didn't even melt. I should have asked to have the waffle made over or at least reheated or toasted but I didn't. The syrup was a sticky plastic bottle of Log Cabin, needless to say it was unheated. However the best part of the breakfast were the fresh Strawberries (they too were cold but oh yeah they're suppose to be), red and sweet but no whipped cream. The coffee was luke warm and very weak we had to ask for a hot fresh cup hoping it would be stronger. The others in my group had traditional egg breakfasts and omelets, with meat, potatos and toast which were just OK. This place is barely average at best and definitely skip the waffle.
I was surprised Nick's was so full of people but then again, I was in Surprise AZ. pun intended."}
{"text":"I only gave 2 stars because the food was decent. I've only been for breakfast. Service and servers act like it's a chore to take your order. Apparently the menus and prices change because when I ordered my usual, my bill was higher. I substitute cottage cheese or tomato slices for the potatoes and toast. I think the server should have told me they changed their menu and about the price change, but didn't. Also, the servers take the toast out of the toaster w/o gloves, as they just took money beforehand from someone to pay tab. Also grab the toast bare handed after busing and cleaning off the tables.That's gross. I just don't get the toast."}
{"text":"Every time we have been here we have got great food and great service. I appreciate the generosity we get going in there. Love the Lasagna."}
{"text":"I was visiting for work and felt like Greek so typed Greek Restaurant into my GPS. 2 came up within a 3 mile radius. I couldn't find Greek Corner so ended up a Nick's Diner. It should have been my first red flag, looking for Greek but going to a restaurant without the word 'Greek' in the name. I order the hummus and pita to start. The hummus was fine, but nothing special. Probably something out of a container. Next was a 'Greek' salad with Gyro meat. The Gyro meat was not finely sliced, but huge chunks sat on a heap on top of the salad  that was barely chopped. The meat was tender but with little flavor. Huge pieces of onion, cucumber and tomato accompanied. You had to work hard slicing and dicing in order to eat the salad. Kitchen staff needs some knife skills. The worst part was the 'Greek' dressing. Which came on the side. A pink concoction that looked like raspberry yogurt. It tasted like a ranch and Italian mixture. I might have been able to eat the mix but couldn't get over the color.

Staff was very friendly and Nick was there too. It seemed like a lot of locals go there. He spoke to and knew most of the patrons. Seemed like an older/senior crowd. I overheard them talking about a senior community near by. As I ate, a couple complained about the spiciness of a dish they had. I did not experience flavor at all. 

On the plane ride I was reading Anthony Bourdain's Medium Raw. He says that a good meal is measured on how you feel afterward. I feel cheated out of a good meal. I even ran 3 miles on the treadmill to earn it. One of the most unsatisfying meals I've ever had. 

Perhaps this is a great diner, but Greek it is not."}
{"text":"Today, Saturday arrived for breakfast, seated 10:10 a.m.  Now 10:40, no food but other people arrived later getting their food.  Finally grabbed someone to ask about it.  Ticket lost.  Didn't even offer anything, not even place order & get out asap.  Furthermore the waitress who gave us drinks never came back to our table.  I'll never return here.  Go NICK's II instead as we've always had good service there!!"}
{"text":"Nick's has a decent breakfast with huge portions. On return visits, very average food."}
{"text":"This place was not good although the staff was friendly my 5 year old son ordered the cheeseburger for kids and it was raw on the outside of the burger. My gyro meat was hard and dried out. And my husbands kebobs had no flavor!"}
{"text":"What a good meal we enjoyed this evening. There were four of us and the food was tasty and the proportions were more than one person could possibly eat. I had the, \"All you can eat,\" fish dinner. There were three huge pieces of breaded fish, steak fries and salad. I couldn't finish two pieces of fish let alone the third. No way could I think of having more. The other's plates were over filled with pasta. So much food! Delicious. 
 Our server must have been new. She forgot some things but the diner was busy.  She was more than accommodating when it was pointed out to her. She was hustling and we couldn't hold that against her. She was very sweet. 
We agreed that next time we go we will split a meal or order a child's plate. I would recommend Nicks Diner to anyone. The menu had choices that you wouldn't expect to find in a small diner. Liver and onions, meatloaf, pasta's, sea food, breakfast and lunch served all day long.  So very tasty."}
{"text":"This is a little gem slightly hidden from the road. My husband and I have come here on different days and during different times and tried several items.  We have yet to be disappointed.  The restaurant is clean with a nice atmosphere and friendly staff.   

They have daily specials listed on a white board by the door and on a huge blackboard next to the kitchen.  My husband really enjoys their omelets.  So far our favorite is the corned beef with swiss.  You can tell that they use fresh ingredients.  I love hearing the cook scrambling the eggs just after we put in our order.

Their chicken lemon rice soup is also very tasty.  It tastes like it was home made and not from a can.  Their gravy is also good and not greasy.

This is a place we will go to often.

The food is always fresh, service is friendly and fast and the price is perfect for the portions."}
{"text":"One of the things that I miss the most from Florida is the plethora of mom and pop diners with good ol' home cookin'--yes, that's my southern girl coming out  ;-)  Anyway, whenever I have an itch for that kind of food (which I do often) it's hard to find a place where I can scratch that itch. Enter Nick's Diner. OMG. This place is amazing. The food is hot, delicious and made from scratch! I have had the open face roast beef sandwich and the open face turkey sandwich. Notice a trend here? Both of them were awesome. They are smothered in gravy and come with mashed potatoes and vegetables. My husband had the mushroom swiss burger. Holy crap, talk about an instant mouthgasm. Mmmm. The patty is made with fresh ground beef. The fries are golden and delicious. My husband is a total fry snob and even HE gave them his stamp of approval. He was asking if we could tip the cook. It was that good. Speaking of tips, the waitress definitely earned hers. She was quick, attentive and did an overall great job. She brought our food out in about 5 minutes (and this was during a very busy lunch rush) and she kept our drinks topped off. I just can't say enough about this place. You HAVE to check them out! Oh, and the prices are extremely reasonable. The open face sandwiches are $7.25 and my husband's burger was a little over $8. Score!"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best and our waitress was incredibly rude.  Brothers Cafe in Peoria is similar to this place, but is MUCH better.  We will not be going back."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for a late breakfast on Monday.  She had a skillet dish and I had the Nicks omlet.  The dishes were just OK and not very hot.  The place had about 7 other people in it so I dont understand the food be only warm.  The omlet and the skillet were both overly full of canned mushroom!!!!  Big ones.  My wife had at least 20 in hers and I know because she took them all out as she doesnt eat mushrooms and no hers was not a mushroom omlet.   I think there other better breakfast places in the area.  Part of the problem may be they are looking for a new cook, the sign was on the door.   I have also seen, online, this restaurant is for sale for $300,000.  I dont think so."}
{"text":"Not a better spot in Surprise for breakfast in my opinion. The waitress that works weekend mornings is an absolute workhorse. I always feel they are understaffed, but you wouldn't know it by how well the entire place gets served by this 1 waitress haha. The food is good homestyle. I'd recommend the greek omelette: absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Terrible service, 1st & 2nd time for breakfast.  Waitress Linda did n/give good service & hostess, Leeza, had to get a second cup of coffee, then had to find Linda to get her to take our money.  Will n/be returning here!!"}
{"text":"Been to Nicks a couple of times. Got the vegetarian omelette with potatoes.  The potatoes are very bland.  No amount of salt, pepper or ketchup can save them.  They usually arrive cold which is a major yuck in my book. The tables are sticky and the ketchup is watered down and nasty. Service is a crapshoot.  Its either really bad or non existent.  For the price you pay I prefer IHOP or Village Inn."}
{"text":"Horrible service with a horrible taste in food!  Our party of 6 ordered all different foods and they were served cold and flavorless.  Nasty employees who are not clean and healthy at all!  Don't even wash hands after handling money and then grabbing your food!! How disgusting"}
{"text":"Food was good people are nice. Got a little gross out my eggs was green in one part.  Food did not have much taste that was kinda disappointing."}
{"text":"Service is HORRIBLE! Was there for 2 hours and saw our waitress about 3 times. We ordered coffee and water and it didn't come out until we got our food, after asking another waitress for help. After finally eating, we had to wait again for our waitress to come back to give us our checks. She then took 20 minutes to get our change, which was still wrong! If this were a new restaurant I could maybe understand but there are 2 if them that hand been open years! Raise your standards, it's embarrassing!"}
{"text":"Tried Nicks for breakfast based on reviews.. had spinach & feta omlet...it was excellent! Service was good and staff was friendly. ."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast, our party of three ordered two greek omelets and an order of french toast. The omelets were A-OK, but the french toast tasted a bit off. I think it was the syrup actually, and the bacon was more fat than meat. Service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and I love going to Nick's.  We've been several times over the past 9 months and it has been consistantly good food and service.  It has that cozy neighborhood feel that we enjoy.

I read a review and someone stated that the menu was vague and he had no idea that his meatloaf would have gravy on it (I'm  not a meatloaf eater but doesn't most meatloaf come with gravy?).  Perhaps a quick question to your server would answer your questions.  It's quite simple.  His wife eight, not seven but eight a sandwich that we all know can be a gut bomb and they were surprised that it wasn't soothing on her stomach.

We love Nick's and are glad that they are in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Excellent greek diner. Inexpensive and good food. Breakfast served all day, kids eat free M Tu W. And 10% off breakfast M-F 7 to 11. And they have a military discount as well"}
{"text":"Nick's gets 5 stars because I go for an occasional burger or breakfast.  I don't want their special lamb or pasta or whatever else they're selling, but when I get the urge for a big breakfast or lunch they hit the spot."}
{"text":"Super bummed.   Went to the new location in bell and reems....didn't recognize any of the staff. Service was seriously lacking, they were quick to seat us then forget us.  Have been going to nicks on reems and Greenway for years. Love the family atmosphere and the new location doesn't compare. All new staff just standing around talking to each other while one guy walked around bussing tables, helping customers. Sorry Nick but you lost a long time customer to the nicks on Waddell and Litchfield."}
{"text":"I used to like this place. I went in the other day and had a Greek omelet. About 90% through the omelet. I found hair in my plate. I was so gross out. I tell the waitress and she tells me there is nothing they can do since it was 90% gone. I agreed. I still believe the Manger who at the bar should have come over to smooth things over. The waitress told me she give me a discount the next time. Well there is not going to be a next time!!!!"}
{"text":"Pleasant server horrible food 4 us and everything we really did want including Belgian waffles they were out so no going back."}
{"text":"I get the feeling that the staff values young adult guests less. I've brought friends here and though we are terribly polite we seem to bother the staff by just being there. However, many young people are servers too, know what good service is and will tip accordingly. My best girl friend and I come in every once and blue moon for brunch and without fail, the staff blows us off. We are never checked on, get one word replies, and we dare not alter our meals even slightly or we'll get dirty looks. Refills weren't offered. My friends and family have lived in the area for a long time and won't be bringing any more business to this diner. I wish I hadn't wasted my time and money there today."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great prices. My go to place for breakfast. Never have to worry about your coffee cup being empty here. Every time I have gone here it is packed, but I have never had to wait for a table. They get you in and out quickly and the food is always HOT!"}
{"text":"Our favorite GoTo for breakfast. Love the new location. Lots of choices for breakfast, great prices and the staff is efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"This place was pretty meh. We ordered online and tried to use a code they advertised on the site for 10% off, but it had expired late last year. Oh well, we were hungry, wanted to bring food home, and the menu looked good.

When we picked up our food, the staff was pleasant. At first I don't think the waitress understood that we were there to pick up food because she told us several times to sit where we wish. We were worried for a second that we had just paid online and they hadn't made food, but they did have the order. I told them about the 10% coupon mishap and she said they would fix it on the site (I actually kind of expected a more generous response because that's really just false advertising, so at that point my review depended upon how good the food turned out). 

We each ordered pita sandwiches. I ordered a honey chicken pita sandwich and my parents ordered gyro sandwiches. The gyro sandwiches were good, but the honey chicken gyro was not quite what I had expected. For $6 I have had much worse, though.

The site made no mention of fries as a side. Huge, steak-cut fries. They were soggy. I would've gladly gotten some other side dish had I known.

We really just dismissed the site as being crappy for most of the miscommunication, but really, I didn't like my honey chicken gyro. The site told us that pickup was at noon, but since the fries were soggy and the cheese on my gyro had that weird consistency (as if it had been microwaved or something), I figured the food sat around for a while.

If you're going to have online ordering, do it right. If you're going to offer discounts, do it right. If you're going to do fries, do it right. This place really didn't do any of it right. We shrugged it off and decided that next time we'll just go to Greek Corner."}
{"text":"Went to Richie diner today at 3:45 4/7/17 to order food to go. Ordered the fish dinner with mash potatoes no grave, coleslaw, Well got home and NO Tarter sauce and No Coleslaw, so happy we paid for 1/ 2  a dinner. Second order was patty melt on sourdough with onion rings. Second dinner ok but burger to thick and a little greasy.  Won't hurry to go back and will never be NICKS!"}
{"text":"Went there last night for dinner with friends.  First time visit.  My wife and I had the Lasagna and it was very good.  It didn't taste like it came from a box.  Waitress was very pleasant and courteous.  Well worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Got here kinda late for breakfast (around noon) and was told that they were still serving breakfast so we were very Happy! The steak and eggs meal had been sold out so we I had to order another meal. But the service was great!  It was ready almost before I could finish washing my hands!  I highly recommend the place."}
{"text":"I was pregnant and craving Greek food.  It was a Tuesday night and one waitress for the entire place.  After a wait my husband & I were seated... Waited 25 minutes for someone to come over to take drink order, when she said she will be back, I told her we are ready to order!
I got an appetizer of hummus and pita chips, it was one pita cut up in 4 slices and a fairly large bowl of hummus.  It was the best part of the meal. That took 15 minutes to come back, I asked for more pita and it was another 20 minute wait.
Eventually maybe by the time we were there 75 minutes they came with our gyros.  Not authentic... Gyro meat was nasty!  After losing patience we just wanted to leave.  Was charged extra for asking for another pita for $4 & change... Not mentioned to me or in menu.  They didn't care.
Family has been to Nick's II and have bad reviews there too!"}
{"text":"richie's diner and nick's diner 2 are not related in anyway not family not business. even though richie is telling people they are related, not true they are not related"}
{"text":"one of the best restaurants on the west side of phoenix metro.  go in the morning m-f before 11 am and I asure u of great food and service. especialy on the 2 egg omlet for only 5.49 served on large plates with the all u want to add omlet is bigger than the plate. I been here many times and can not stay away.  ask for the PUNCH CARD , only 6 punches and the 7 is FREE."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  At all.  Party of 5 and a baby.  Took forever and it wasn't even crowded.  My Country Skillet was cold.    The gravy was thick.   Gave it a chance but it's back to Jim's Burgers for me and my family.  The service was sub par at best."}
{"text":"first time going. went for a quick breakfast. sat at the bar, waitress/bartender was very unpleasant/unwelcoming, hardly greeted me and i had to wait to order. owner happened to come near the bar and i asked him if there was anyone working at the bar and his response was \"yeah, where are you (whatever her name was) are you being lazy?\" he never apologized nor asked if he could get me anything. worst service for a diner. food was mediocre at best. wont be going back."}
{"text":"As a local and loyal customer I frequent Nicks a few times a month with my family and friends.  I had a restaurant. Com certificate which I always use on my smartphone to redeem at restaurants,  was not accepted by the owner.  He said I had to go print it out for him to accept it. So I looked at the fine print on the site and it says to just show the code on your smartphone to the waitress and press redeem and I get my discount. They refused so I paid the bill and walked out. Such bad service throughout as if we were bothering them. Not happy."}
{"text":"Great breakfast experience. Huge portions served quickly. My eggs were cooked just right and everything was hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Very friendly service, great coffee (even decaf!)
Large portions, gyro skillet and corned beef with potatoes and eggs was very good. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great Service & Yummy Food. !  I love getting the Greek Favorite Omelette, which has Gyro Meat in it w Feta Cheese!!!

I have been coming here for years.  I've eaten Breakfast & Lunch there.  I've gone there with co-workers, or post-gym workout.  Certainly been there early in the morning 7am noshing on food & slurping down coffee to end a good night out.

The Flaming Saganaki Cheese is incredible !  When I met a friends mother, we took her out to eat here & they put on a nice presentation when they bring it out and say \"Opa\" when they light it on fire"}
{"text":"My wife and I come here every week, get the same waitress (Vicki, who is awesome!) And the same gyro omelet every time. This is the type of cafe that knows your name and you can count on the same great experience every time! Absolutely recommend! Ask for Vicki, she is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Food was disgusting. I asked for a salad I got lettuce and a rotten tomato. I got a chicken gyro and what I actually got was runny sauce, a soggy pita, a ton of onions and some pieces of dry chicken. My server had the biggest attitude problem. When I would say thank you or please she would just ignore me and walk away. She never came back to the table to see if we needed anything or to ask if we were okay. Just a horrible first experience I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my family.   They had a dinner special ribeye steak and mashed potatoes for $11.99.  The steak was rancid and the potatoes tasted like instant potatoes and were cold.  Mixed vegetables were also cold.  The burgers and fries we got were over priced and small but tasted good.  Kids chicken strips had red stuff under the batter and had cartilage in some of them.   To their credit they offered to replace the food but we were afraid of what we would get.  They did take the steak special off the bill.  We will not return to this location.   We have since heard the other Surprise location is better.  Forgot to mention the walls have splatters and the place is really dirty."}
{"text":"I've only been there for breakfast a couple times but we liked the food both times.  We both had omelets which were of generous portions.  The prices could be a little cheaper, but the food is pretty darn good and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I have had breakfast here as well as dinner. Love the Greek salad with add on grilled chicken, so flavorful. I'm trying to eat healthier so when I had breakfast I chose the Greek omelet with eggs beaters and substituted the home fries for tomatoes. My friends get the hamburgers to go on a regular basis because they are so much better than fast food and not much of a price difference. Get a punch card because you'll be back to fill it up. Oh yah the Gyro is huge you'll take some home, yummy too..."}
{"text":"We have been going here for breakfast and lunch before they were at this new location and since. Great flood at great prices. Most the time good service. Sometimes it gets busy and they can get overwhelmed but for the most part always good service and food."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend this spot over any IHOP or Denny's for sure. The place is cozy, it gives you that New York diner feel when you enter. The servers are friendly. I was surprised to see how generous the portions are for the price. The food  was yummy. 

P.S. Donna is awesome"}
{"text":"Breakfast specials are super amazingly priced ($5.59) and decently portioned!  We were seated, waited on, and served in a rapid manner (which I LOVE & appreciate).  Food was good and filling, everything was clean and we had a positive experience. Would definitely come back for bfast!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times but have found that the crispy fries that I ordered with my breakfast were not hardly cooked they weren't even hot, lukewarm. I didn't complain so I took them home and finished cooking them myself. Not the first time something has not been exactly as ordered. Prices are great though."}
{"text":"I truly hate having to give a local small business such a bad review. But it is what it is! 

We arrived for breakfast and sat ourselves... 2 adults and 2 small children. The place was about 3/4 full. We weren't not even recognized for 5 minutes. 

Here's the lowdown... 
Coffee... room temperature 
Orange juice... Overpriced and the quality of what you'd expect from QT. 
Western omelet and homefries... both incredibly bland. I'd go as far as to say borderline tasteless. 
Pancakes... Large and delicious! 
Cornbeef hash... Delicious! 
Kids French Toast... Completely devoured. 
Service... Basic at best. 
The bill... $40 for breakfast for 2 adults and 2 kids under 5 years old. Outrageous! 

I want to hope they were having a bad day. I dunno. But I know this... I ate my words. When we pulled up we had a brief conversation about eating here. I actually said \"How bad can they mess up breakfast food?\"."}
{"text":"Well, I truly have had better at IHOP and Village Inn.  We've gone to the diner many times and my husband a few times by himself.  He now refuses to go due to food quality.  He stated the liver was over cooked and slimy and many other items were poorly made.  I asked for my mushrooms to be precooked prior to being placed in the Omelet.  It didn't happen and we were the only ones in the restaurant early in the AM.  The waitress did ignore a few of my breakfast requests so not sure she even wrote it down.  I do like their hash browns.

This review was for the old Nicks Diner before they moved and changed names"}
{"text":"A lovely little restaurant with your favorite diner foods. Richi, the owner always comes around to make sure you are satisfied with your order which shows great commitment on his part. Everything that we've ordered so far has been great. 

You can sit inside or on the patio which I personally love around this time of year. Richi's is clean, friendly, and easy to find. Great prices as well for the amount of food you receive."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Nicks. Half a very large sandwich and soup (homemade) for $5."}
{"text":"Worst Gyro ever, disgusting, The taste of garlic covers the low quality meats, the order was wrong with onions over the whole thing, meat tasted funny.  I can't wait for the aftertaste to leave my mouth. Really the worst gyro I have ever eaten , well almost eaten could only take like two bites before I had to stop. Most of the gyro went to the trash where it belonged. No offer of a refund, Horrible. Just shut your doors if this is what you consider good. I wish I could give a negative rating. I feel sick. I hope the health department shuts you down. I see where there are other responses where people feel sick after eating there , stop refiling your ketchup bottles.I have worked in the food service industry and a big red flag is ketchup bottles that can be refilled many health departments don't allow them. Clean up your act before you kill someone."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure the place was open because the sign seemed out and there is a big window painting that only says what the breakfast hours are. But I tried the door and sure enough!  There were two other tables seated so I just went in and found a place to sit. Took a minute to get a menu and my front order in but wasn't too terribly long. 

I had the \"grilled pork chops, mashed potatoes, and steamed veggies\". My order came with a choice of soup or salad so, based on other reviews, I tried the lemongrass chicken soup.  It came out after a short wait and, well, I've never had this before and it was pretty good. Very lemony. 

A short bit after that came my entrée.  Two giant pork chops, a heaping mound of mashed potatoes, and what we call in New Mexico, \"calabictas\".  The potatoes were so hot I was sure they were microwaved. They weren't. They had a nice garlicky flavor and a good gravy. There were chunks of potato in the mix, and I like that.  Had to let those cool. Then I tried the veggies which I was sure we're microwaved. They weren't.  They were nicely steamed and not mushy carrots, squash, and zucchini, and trace amounts of cauliflower and broccoli.  Normally I nibble at calabictas because in Santa fe, well. They microwave them. And they're mushy. I ate all my veggies. So far so good, right?

The pork chops:  Although cooked correctly, hot and juicy, they reminded me of my step mothers pork chops. Absolutely no flavor. The difference being that my step mothers chops are dry as the Arizona desert. These chops weren't. They were nice and juicy.  Just bland. So. That made me sad. 

One thing to note, the servers talk to each other across the room. Because of this, I learned that if you order the daily special, check your ticket. Sometimes they forget to program the \"computer\". Also. While my ice tea glass ran dry, rather than fill my glass, the server spent a fair amount of time refilling condiments at empty tables. My server was very nice. Just slightly inattentive. 

This is a locals place, that much is for sure. They even offer a discount card. 

Oh. And yes. They do serve lunch and dinner. It looks like you already know about the breakfasts. 

Im giving 4 stars because the food is \"real\". Next time I'll try something other than pork chops though."}
{"text":"Well I just walked into Richi's  literally stood there for a minute and zero people said a word to me. One person looked at me, then another, then another then another. Three people behind the bar and not one word spoken to me. I said guess they don't want my business. As I am walking out an elderly couple walks in, the door hasn't even closed behind me and I hear \"sit where ever you'd like\". Wow... I heard the food was good. I have time to kill before work and wanted to try here. But again I can't ev3n review the food because no body and I mean nobody acknowledged my even standing there. Literally standing outside fuming as I write this. Weak attempt at customer service as I watch another couple walk in and barely through the door before being spoken to."}
{"text":"The only reason this was 2 stars is the prime rib was ok, not great but just ok. We asked to be seated on the patio, we got our orders placed but then we were totally forgotten for at least 45 minutes, no water or anything, By this time we were the only customers on the patio, finally our salads came out and we asked for water again. Another 10 minute wait. Meanwhile I saw the chef arrive at the door to the patio carrying 2 plates, he saw us still eating our salads, he turned around and went back to the kitchen. After another 5 minutes the waitress brought our plates out and said she would check on us. We started to eat but our dinner was cold by this time since they had taken it back to the kitchen, the vegetables are so bland and over boiled I will not eat them, my potato had a bad spot so I could only eat half of it. Our waitress never came out to check on our meal. I will never go back."}
{"text":"I had Nick's Diner cater a recent gathering...and it was a HUGE hit with the family! And it was DELICIOUS!!!

 I ordered trays of:
-gyro meat (inc. pitas, tomatoes, onions and tzatziki sauce)
-chicken kabobs
-rice pilaf  
-Greek spaghetti (first time we've had it - won't be the last!)  

It was ready when I got there and Nick, himself, helped me load it into my car :)

We were SO happy with our meal that I will have to have Nick make us dinner every once in a while. He has a great Dinner delivery offering which is posted on their Facebook page.  And, for those of us who live in Surprise, this includes FREE delivery!

Our family LOVES Nick's Diner!"}
{"text":"3 egg breakfast with a bacon,sausage, potatoes,and a pancake always hits the spot in the morning for a quick bite! So good°"}
{"text":"So... updating my review.  Tried them again today (which just happened to be a year later) and they just haven't improved enough to warrant another trip.  

Got the Saturday Chicken Salad Lunch special that comes with the sandwich, fries/soup/salad and a drink.

The soup was OK (chicken lemon rice) but the sandwich was pretty boring.  It was just chicken salad on bread with a few pickles on the side.  No lettuce, tomato, just chicken.  I was taking pieces from my wife's club sandwich (which wasn't much better) to make my sandwich be more like a sandwich.  Her club, while it had a bunch of meat, was dry and nothing special.  When we got the bill, I was charged for the drink, that was supposed to be included.  When I pointed it out, I had to explain that the special included a drink.

I'll also add that while they have a pretty sizable menu, I have to wonder how fresh things like the meatloaf and brisket are.  This isn't exactly a high volume place where they need to crank out a new loaf or brisket frequently.  

FYI, they now also have a $10 minimum to use a credit card which is not allowed by visa/MasterCard."}
{"text":"Reuben worked. Not as good as Irish Wolfhound but still good. I love this place. I seldom stray from the burgers at Nick's because they are... Are you ready for this?... THE BEST BURGERS IN ARIZONA!!! I am not kidding."}
{"text":"Breakfast is excellent. A big selection, and good home cooking. Service was great too. Had dinner there, it was so so. Service was good but food wasn't exceptional."}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday morning at 7:30 AM there were only a couple others enjoying their breakfast. By the time we left the restaurant was half full. We were told that if you come at 9:30 AM the wait would be an hour. I can understand why!The food was amazing, the service was even better. This place is not your typical hole in the wall American diner. It's an experience well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Love it!! Huge portions at great prices. Very clean place and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Don't get this place confused with Nicks 2 on Waddell, that place is fantastic. The original Nicks food and service falls short compared to Nicks 2."}
{"text":"First time at Richi's was a few weeks ago. Ive been back twice already. I highly recommend it. The food is great, the service is on point, and the atmosphere makes you feel at home.

*Phoenix Foodies Approved!"}
{"text":"Good place to eat a relaxing home-cooking style meal.  My friend had the lamb shank and hardly said a word the whole time... he was busy eating! 
Another friend had the chicken kabobs and they were great, there were 4 of them which I don't know how anyone could eat all that. 
Everything was great, glad I got the good referral for this place."}
{"text":"How we found this place I don't know it's a bit hidden! On our way home looking for something other than fast food was our plan! I personally am Leary of diners because of their desire to fry everything ! But it was Friday night,  fish and chips was the special, the young waitress told us it was very good so we indulged it was very good, extremely hot as well!  Once again fried food, but I see breakfast is on menu so will be back to try that! Since I've only been once I will only give it 3 stars but hopefully will upgrade if I find the other visits just as appealing!"}
{"text":"Nick's Diner is awesome. My husband and I went for the first time and were lucky to beat the dinner rush, we were seated right away. It quickly felt like family with several servers making sure we were taken care of. The food was good and a really generous size for the price. I had the french toast and my husband had a steak the size of his plate! The atmosphere is nothing fancy and it is what I would expect from a traditional family diner. I was VERY pleased with Nick's and immediately recommended the diner to several friends in the area. I can't wait to go back when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Just had our first but definitely not our last breakfast at Nick's and we are stuffed! The French toast was so good, bacon nice and crispy. I love that when you order oj you get a big glass not a small 4oz size. My husband had a little bit of everything, eggs cooked perfectly, hash browns, sausage that was not too spicy with just enough hint of sage and toast that was already buttered. We can't wait to go back and try the burgers which our waitress said are the best. We had no wait either."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast, for the first time. Must say that I was not impressed nor disappointed. It was okay however the coffee was not to par with other places I've eaten in. Nicks dinner on Waddell is much better by far. Probably will come back but unlikely."}
{"text":"There were four of us and all our meals were bland and unflavored! We had breakfast so 2 omelettes and 2 breakfast sandwiches. The sandwiches were supposed to have cheese and there was just sprinkle and not even salt and pepper. 
Service was good and place is clean but the food was not! Disappointed overall"}
{"text":"This place is going downhill!! I've been here a few times. Took some friends from out of town here 6/9/14... The waitresses were rude no customer service.. Older Hispanic lady and older white lady. The hash use to be real good, was really bland. Kind of embarrassing since I recommended the place based on the hash. Service was  probably the reason I won't be returning though."}
{"text":"After hearing rave reviews about this place from friends and family, I figured I'd give it a try. In a nutshell, the best word I can use to describe the place is bland. Don't get me wrong, the menu is very diverse. The prices can't be beat. I had a hard time selecting an item to try because there were so many great selections to choose from. I decided to settle on something simple because in my eyes, a restaurant worth it's moxie is going to be able to handle the simple stuff perfectly. So I had a turkey and Swiss sandwich with a cup of the soup of the day which was a lemon chicken rice soup. And it was all so darn bland! The lemon soup was only slightly lemony and it had 1 piece of chicken in it and a few floaters of rice. The turkey was...strange. It wasn't like a piece carved off the turkey itself, and it wasn't deli meat either. I'm not sure if it was a bunch of pieces compacted together or what. I had it on wheat and it was toasted which is fine....but damn if it wasn't just ugh bland. 

Because my husband really likes this place, I'll give it another try in the hopes that it was just an off day but man the first impression was really...bland."}
{"text":"Still like Nick's but disappointed to see another price increase. Used to get the gyro sandwich for around 6 bucks but it is now 7.50. Still a pretty good deal overall. Will probably still come around occasionally."}
{"text":"Waitress horrible...over heard them complaining about tips ...saying they don't get paid enough...very unorganized... Bad attitudes...being rude to customer...didn't wash hands...touching bread and then handling cash register"}
{"text":"Wow. Great food. Fantastic value. Huge portions. I had the Gyro lunch platter. It consisted of the gyro which was packed with meat and veggies, a cup of lemon-chicken soup and iced tea with refills. All for $8.50. Specials for every day of the week. Staff was friendly and offered us their card for a discount after 6 meals.  Will definitely go back. Greek , Italian and American food.  Centrally located on Rheems between Bell and Greenway with plenty of parking. This is the Original Nicks Diner."}
{"text":"A great breakfast stop with the family. I met up with a friend and her children for breakfast. The owner came out and gave special attention to each child. It was the sweetest thing and the kids loved it. The space is definitely updated, open and bright, and very clean. Our waitress was attentive and so pleasant. The service here was excellent! My friend and I each ordered the eggs Benedict, and it was okay. I'll be back, but I'll likely pick pancakes or waffles next time."}
{"text":"The Best Bacon Cheeseburger hands down. We eat at Nick's at least twice a month and always get excellent service. On Mon, Tue and Wed kids eat free! Our family of four can eat at Nick's for less than twenty dollars. We never leave hungry. We have also tried the fish and chips YUM! and some of the breakfast. If you are looking for great food that is fresh at a great price then definitely try Nick's."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast with my friend and we left completely satisfied. My friend suggested I try their breakfast sausages and the scallop potatoes. It was fantastic. The sausages were oh-so delicious!! Oh gawd, just thinking of those sausages makes me want to fly back to AZ! The plate I ordered had three huge sausages, scallop potatoes and scrambled eggs with toast.It is simply a good, old-fashioned  breakfast. You can't go wrong with that."}
{"text":"Asked a Local for a recommendation for a good Breakfast joint.  Score!

Service was prompt with generous portions of fresh tasty home food.  Two thumbs up on the chicken fried steak breakfast plate, no gristle, no grease and enough potatoes to sustain me on the Long Drive back to the city!"}
{"text":"I just ate at Nicks Diner and the food was fabulous.  I had a club sandwich and instead of the usual lunch meat, this sandwich had real, cut off the breast turkey, real grilled ham and a stack of bacon. It was by far the best club sandwich I've had in years. Not only that, but the prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Not worth waiting to get in. Nice looking diner and good service. Small place and had to wait. Went for breakfast and had chicken fried steak, eggs, home fries. A side pancake and potato cakes to share. Chicken fried steak seemed pre-packaged, pancake tasted like Bisquick mix and potatoes cakes are more like hash browns. Eggs and home fries were good."}
{"text":"Nick's could be a really great breakfast and lunch place because it's in a great location and the servers are very attentive.  However, since the management changed, the fried food seems to have taken a bad turn. The bacon, French fries, sausage, etc. all have not been drained of the excess grease/oil. It's horrible to have so much grease until the food actually shines.  I've mentioned it but to no avail. Maybe if others will note this to the servers, there will be a change.  I don't want to have to find another diner but removing my items and using napkins to drain the grease is ridiculous."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to Richis. I never noticed it before so I went in to check it out. The hostess at the front had her face in her phone for a good 5 minutes before she even noticed us standing there. She sat us and the waitress came and took our drink order. I ordered one of their combo breakfast plates...chicken fried steak, eggs and toast. Pretty easy right? She returns with my food and the sight was just appauling. the chicken fried steak tasted like one of those dollar banquet frozen meals covered in this thick gellatenous \"gravy\" and no toast. She said she would be right back at which point she went into the back and started yelling at the cooks that they needed to make up some toast. Very unprofessional. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Went there about 10:30 this morning.  Was seated and handed a menu.  Then I waited... and waited... and waited. While waitresses ran around, none even looked at me.  After 15 minutes I got up and left.  The hostess asked if I was leaving. I said yes, no one would wait on me.  She said she'd get someone, I said, no, I'll eat somewhere else.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"Last experience here was worst by far.  We're semi regulars so we came back to give them another chance.

Best burgers in town!  Huge!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Nicks in a while.  I went for dinner last night.  I ordered what I always order.  Breaded Pork Tenderloin with chicken rice soup.  The soup was so lemony and salty, it was almost inedible.   The main course was actually thin cut pork chops that were breaded, not pork tenderloin, and yes there is a difference.  They were tough and a little stringy.  All in all, pretty disappointing meal.  Maybe I just caught them on a bad night!"}
{"text":"It pains me to give Nick's Diner such a terrible review, but there was almost nothing good about the entire experience. I was looking forward to giving it a shot. I just moved into the area and passed by. It was busy, not an empty table in the house, so my party decided to eat at the bar. Kind of an uncomfortable spot to eat. It took a while for the wait staff to take our drink order and when they did, actually came off fairly rude and I am always a really pleasant patron, so it caught me off guard.

When I went to the restroom, I came back to another party taking my seat, even though my drink was just placed there, so I was put in the uncomfortable place of having to say the seat was already taken.

I ordered the soup of the day to start - it was a lemon chicken soup. It was so salty, I had a very hard time finishing it... but I was so hungry that I did anyway. It was just such a bad consistency on top of it. So, I ordered the fish & chips, simple enough. The fish was decent. The fries were pretty bad. I guess the best way to describe everything is to say it was bland (outside of the bizarre tasting sodium soup, of course). The fries were limp and had no taste at all.

All said and done, I get the bill in a hurry, well before I finished my meal. Then, the waitress literally stood as close as possible to me to prod me on in giving her my payment. It was awkward, made me feel super uncomfortable. I feel bad that I was the one who suggested giving it a try."}
{"text":"We finally tried Nicks Diner a few weeks ago, and it was GREAT.  Went for breakfast, their Breakfast pita omelette was amazing. Veggies were fresh and crunchy, cooked perfectly, hubby had traditional bfast and loved it. Went again last weekend with our 3 hungry teen boys, they were in heaven as well. Plenty of food served and choices range from Greek to traditional American style fare. We are going for dinner tonite, we'll see how that goes. For now, breakfast is definately an A plus. Only thing I can say I didnt like was the self-seating and the chairs....all metal bottoms and they SCREECH whenever anybody moves away from their table."}
{"text":"This is a new place I never been 2 before.  clean place! Clean bathroom! Looks great! The 
Waitress is fast can't get a word In!
She forgot the coffee and soft drink!
I order the cheese burger it taste horrible its like the meet went bad please check your meet!  The seasoning sucks it taste so bad! It taste like  Poopoo. The mayonnaise  got me it taste like it went bad. Please check care products because it summertime meet and cheese go bad quickly. The waitress new I was upset  she did not ask me if I was ok. Than I was going to say something she interrupted me. I was pissed off! Had a stomach cramp."}
{"text":"I decided to do something different before writing this review.  I've panned through a good dozen or so reviews on Nick's Diner. I am in disbelief that this place is as highly rated as it is.  I presume it's comprised of mostly family and friends schilling this establishment. I haven gone to this restaurant a total of two different times (on two completely different occasions) to try some of the same and some different food items only to be left to wonder what did I eat.  Moreover, did I really pay that much as well for what I bought? Off to the nitty gritty details.  Firstly you walk in and notice the restaurant is dark.  Keep mind it is Surprise, AZ, but seriously, it's so dimly lite for such a small eating space.  Next thing I've noticed is that it's never really busy.  Service is, on the slow side.  Staff seems to be stressed by their manager.  The staff acted as if they were rushed and overworked however, the restaurant was maybe 20% occupied.  I've been to many other bustling other eateries where staff is constantly running back and forth on their feet and are welcoming to serve patrons.  Here, not so much.  Next, is the food.  It's reminiscent of Aramark or Sysco foods. I ordered the gyros with a side of coleslaw.  The serving portion was big, but it tasted sweet.  The gyro sandwich was definitely off (this was not a Kronos gyro).  The coleslaw was not tasty, fresh or edible.  I also ordered the charbroiled chicken dinner.  The chicken was bland, dry and pressed to the point it wasn't recognizable.  It came with a side of rice.  If it wasn't for the sodium/msg it was loaded with, well, it was definitely a salt mine.  The dried, possibly freezer-burned vegetables looked as if it came from a bag.  I steered clear of them for that very reason. Lastly is the cost, for the food offerings, I thought it was overpriced.  Surprise, AZ  is comprised of a sprawling elderly community and some young families and quality of food definitely was not on par with food costs.   It didn't stand out to me that I would want to eat here again based on quality of food and overall cost."}
{"text":"Every Weekend we find ourselves dining with Richie and his family. Delish food, large portions and the WAFFLES!!  Family restaurant where the head Chef is Richie."}
{"text":"Great food. Excellent service, pretty darn quick. Very pleasant waitress. All day breakfast, so tried the Nicks Greek omelette . Good choice. Nice sized portion...I left stuffed."}
{"text":"Well what do you do when you're visiting friends in Surprise, you don't know your way around-one kid wants Italian food and one wants pancakes?  You try Nick's out of course!  Walking in the first impression is a very casual laid back diner, one tv on in the corner.  We were greeted and told to sit where we like.  There were 2 servers working that night, both of which were friendly.
We ordered the NY strip steak meal, Ribs (nightly special), fettuccine Alfredo and pancakes with sausage.  Pancakes and sausage were A+ perfection.  Ribs and steak were tasty as well.  My daughter didn't love the Alfredo but I thought it was good.  Prices are amazing.  What a bargain!  Service was good. 
Only thing that was lacking was the salad needs some help. It literally was romaine lettuce with 1 slice of tomato.  I know it's still a good deal but could you afford a crouton or 2?"}
{"text":"Out visiting a friend and he's loves the breakfast here at Richis.  Breakfast was served even at 1 pm and the Country Fried Steak was awesome . I ordered an Gyro it was delicious ! Service was good and food was great. Not to mention there are awesome breakfast specials available all week long Mon - Friday ."}
{"text":"I love Nicks. We've been customers for years. I love their breakfasts. My favorite is the Greek omelet. Yum. The service can be kind of inconsistent at times, but usually good. We have had lunch and dinner and are always happy! Very affordable too."}
{"text":"Ok first time visitor.
Prices are cheap.
Went there specifically for a Greek salad.
Was told they didn't have any Greek dressing and had run out of it in the afternoon. It was 5:30 when we tried to order it. They couldn't make more for the evening diner?
We got up and left.
Also on the the menu it showed that rice with marinara was served with most dinners. Never saw that before on a Greek/Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Well, we just had our worst experience this past weekend! Has nothing to do with the food! Food is really good, their service was really bad. Wife, daughter, her friend, and myself had lunch there this past Saturday! Even though their food was good, Again! our waitress was really bad, Wife order their cheeseburger well done! I had to send it back because it was really pink. Daughter wanted extra bbq sauce and ranch dressing! Never got the ranch dressing. I had to keep on top of her for refills! This is not going to stop us from coming back, but now we will consider other options now."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a diner, that isn't a chain, this is the place to go. The servers are friendly and the food is fantastic!!

It's always busy on Sundays but we seem to be able to get a table right away. This is important because we bring my 99 year old Grandma who doesn't want to wait."}
{"text":"I've had several meals here and the food is mediocre. Nothing special in taste or presentation. But my biggest complaint is the service. In all my visits you have to ask for more coffee or water and no one checks up on you.  The hostess was friendly, welcoming and helpful."}
{"text":"The owner of this Diner is a really nice guy and the food is actually pretty good for the price; however, the wait staff is young and inexperienced to give you a great customer experience.  Don't expect to have your drinks refilled and if something is wrong with your order you will wait a while to have it corrected.  All in all just go somewhere else for the price you're going to pay at this establishment."}
{"text":"Third time I've been in due to a lack of breakfast places around and I have to say this place sucks. The women who work here seem to be the most miserable humans on earth. Owning a restaurant myself I pride myself on our customer service and positive demeanor. I actually got a judge mental noise (which I don't know how to convey through writing) when my husband said no toast.  She might as well have rolled her eyes! 
Outside of the terrible customer service my husband and I ordered the meat omelettes. The outside was over cooked while the inside was undercooked, the bacon was limp and actually triggered my gag reflex and the potatoes have zero seasoning. 
Previous to owning a restaurant I would probably have excused the behavior for having a bad day but not anymore. You want a business/job? You gotta work for it."}
{"text":"\"I felt like I was eating a good family homecooked meal!\" Those were the words that came out of my husband's mouth after dragging him to go to this diner. My husband was being stubborn that day that he decided he would finally go in and try it. Yes, it is in a strip mall, and it is tucked away, but it is definitely worth giving a try.
The waitresses are so friendly and they greet you when you walk in. There is a huge variety of food: Greek-Italian-American. They serve breakfast all day long! 
Surprising to most, the chicken lemon rice soup is really good. They always offer it as a side if you would rather have soup than french fries or onion rings. The onion rings are cooked to perfection so it is definitely a tough choice between having those rings or the fries. The gyros are pretty big, so if you are hungry order one and make sure you get extra feta cheese on it. The kabobs are pretty good too. You could get a plate with 1 kabob for $11 or 2 for $12, and it comes with marinara covered rice. It sounds strange to cover the rice with marinara, but maybe it's a tradition somewhere else, and it works. I really liked that marinara sauce. On the Italian side, the lobster ravioli was decent, and it came on a huge platter, so only order that ravioli when you are starving or want to take some home. I didn't even cover the sandwiches or burgers yet, but my friends have tried several of them and they said they are all good. As you can notice, I keep saying everything is good. (Not amazing, but really good! We are talking about a diner here!) It's refreshing that it's a non-chain restaurant too! 
All I can say is that my co-workers have been there at least 9 times in the past 2-3 months at our lunch break and they always get us out in 30-40 minutes at most with satisfied, content bellies!"}
{"text":"Not be confused with Nick's Diner II located on Litchfield. I think this is spin off of Nick's Diner on Reems. Separate owners."}
{"text":"Disappointing in every way. From the moment we walked in my 11 year old commented \"seems like the people working here don't want to be here.\" It was 7:30 and they close at 9 so it's not like we were sending them into overtime. A big huge spider crawled out of the dirty creamer bowl on the table. The fish and chips were bland although they had good texture- their cook does have skill but I felt like he didn't have real food to work with. The syrup was in a honey jar which was confusing. My boyfriend got liver and onions - which again had some promise but his mashed potatoes were cold in the middle and the vegetables, cold and soggy, must have been sitting out for hours. As someone else said, the salad is lettuce with a tomato slice and one pitted olive. Then, at 8:07, the staff shook out the rug right next to us and started putting the chairs up on all the tables. Talk about not feeling welcome. My boyfriend also got sick about 30 minutes later. Unfortunately we won't be back, which is too bad because it's hard to find decent liver and onions."}
{"text":"The good:
Staff is friendly. 

The bad:
The menu has way to much on it. They can't specialize and therefore there's to much.
The food itself is mushy and doesn't have much flavor"}
{"text":"Good food, rude waitress named Theresa. The Nicks II on Litchfield is nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"Food was decent, but service was great.

I decided to try Nick's with my teen-aged daughter for breakfast. We only had about 40 minutes to eat before she had to be at a school function and the restaurant is close to home. The prices seemed reasonable and Google's reviews were mostly good, so we didn't have much to lose. I figured it was this, or fast food. I'm glad we picked this.

I ordered the corned beef hash omelet without onions. The green bell peppers were fresh and not overcooked. The sliced potatoes gave a more pleasing texture compared to the typical cubed approach. The sliced corned beef's lack of intensity and the processed swiss (?) cheese both detract from an otherwise solid idea. I had to pull the beef out to taste on its own to confirm it was indeed corned beef. The interesting choice to side the omelet with white gravy that wasn't overpowering makes up for some of the omelet's shortcomings - I wouldn't have tried the combination otherwise. Despite the grilled nature of the filling, the meal didn't seam greasy at all. The omelet could have used salt, but that approach to cooking seems better for you anyway. I'd still probably get it again if I didn't feel adventurous enough to try one of the many other breakfast options. 
 
My daughter ordered a tuna melt, but forgot that \"melt\" meant cheese was included (she hates cheese). She was a good sport and pulled it off without burdening the kitchen-staff. The side salad it came with was simple - iceberg lettuce with a tomato and a couple of Greek olives. With some Italian dressing, she was happy!

As for the service - our server Vicky was very friendly and attentive. Despite taking our time to decide, she put our order in ahead of a larger group as she knew we were short on time based on some conversation. Our food came quickly, leaving my daughter and I plenty of time to enjoy the meal without feeling rushed. She even reminded us that we could stay as long as we liked, but commented that she knew the offer didn't matter as we were short on time. Kudos for remembering your table!

The service and other promising menu choices would bring me back for more. I'll be sure to bring my Greek-food-loving wife next time - she'd most certainly want to try the rotisserie lamb shank!"}
{"text":"Took the parents there on a Sunday about 1 pm.  The place wasn't that busy but we sat ourselves.  Waited for about five minutes as two employees were busy talking behind the bar, but when two customers came in, she jumped to it and gave them menus.  Mom said let's go!  That was our first and last experience with this place."}
{"text":"We've been going here for over a year and the last few visits the quality of food has gone down.  We like to order take-out but every time, there is something missing from the order.  My husband loves the gyros sandwich which is some of the best around & always has been a generous portion but tonight about half the normal size.  I ordered the bbq rib special and was not good at all.  Must have been leftovers with sauce slapped on and microwaved. Two small pieces and very dry. Never have liked the thick steak fries, either undercooked or hard.  Ordered chicken noodle soup and it wasn't anything like chicken soup. It was spicy, a couple of peas, bits of tomato in a reddish broth with a few noodles.  No chicken anywhere.  We've never had breakfast here and the reviews seem to be good.  But for dinner, we will try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the fish fry on Friday although service was a little slow.   returned for breakfast this morning and after waiting 10 to 15 minutes we left.   Observed many open tables.   I'm sure the food would have been good but the service is truly lacking.  Good place if you have lots of time to waste."}
{"text":"This rating of 3 is given reluctantly because there are many good things to say about Richie's. We are fairly regular customers and we have noticed some physical attributes that need attention. The restrooms are outdated but more importantly, not clean. There are chipped corners on many walls in the dining area that could be easily fixed. Unfortunately, these cosmetic & cleaning issues make us wonder what the food prep area is like. 
Again, we've been regular customers since they moved to this new location and we really want Richie's to be successful so we give this comment as constructive.  The food is good, the service is good and Richie is a very hard working great guy."}
{"text":"My mom and I went to Nick's for dinner!  We both had the pot pie soup and half of a club sandwich!  The price was only $5.00!  The soup was good and the sandwich was yummy as well!  Our waitress was very friendly and efficient!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place to get good food. Breakfast all day. I tried the Richie Greek skillet. Eggs on the side with sour dough toast. Good portions. Tasty. Will be back to try more menu items. Met the owner. He was wondering around the restaurant checking on diners and clearing plates. Related to the Rays pizza joints all over town."}
{"text":"Cheap and simple but delicious breakfast food! 

There is always a wait but they turn over the tables really quickly and you'll have your food in no time. The food is delicious and the portions are big. Service was fast and friendly!

We didn't have lunch but the lunch menu looked delicious! Can't beat that Greek food! Yum! I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Yuk. Sorry but the food was awful. Tried Nicks three times now & won't be back. The service was really bad too. I really wanted to like this as it's so close to my house."}
{"text":"It's local, it's not a chain but man was it disappointing. 

My biggest complaint about the menu is that it is vague. There are some cool names for dishes but no descriptions as to what is on the plate. Ruben (corn beef or pastrami, you tell me) 
baked meat loaf (what does it come with) 
Western omelet (what makes it western) 

I got the baked meat loaf dinner. This is all the menu stated. I get a plate with steamed vegetable, mash potatoes, and two slices of meat loaf smothered with dark brown gravy. (I am not a gravy person) but the menu did not state what was coming on the plate. The mash potatoes tasted like instant potatoes, the vegetables were obviously a FROZEN medley. the meat loaf was flavorless and the gravy was instant. Very disappointing. 

My wife got he Philly cheese steak with onions and peppers. She only eight the meat. The onions and peppers were soaked with grease. Shortly after eating she had an upset stomach and the runs. Needless to say she was not happy. 

You can't make potatoes from a box and steam frozen vegetables and expect people to come back for more."}
{"text":"My wife and I Come down here every year to surprise Arizona always go to Nick's on Reems. Love their breakfast and coffee, and I love this Greek food"}
{"text":"Have been to Richi's twice. First time was right after they opened and service and food were great. 2nd time no so good service was very very bad. The food was not so great either. My husband ordered coffe, but the waitress went to every table around us to do refills, did not stop by our table then I tried to get her attention and she did not even acknowledge me. I ended up getting up to get her and she acted like I was bothering her. Our assigned waitress came back to our table only once to deliver the good and then the bill after we flagged her down to get it.  Really thought this Resturante would be a regular for us. Not so much any more. Too bad it could of been a good, so dissapointed."}
{"text":"I was surprised to find that Nick's wasn't a traditional diner.  in the last month the availability of greek / mediterranean food in surprise has increased by 200% a trend I'm quite fond of.

expecting american traditional food I suggested Nick's knowing they recently opened their doors.  We arrived to find they have a variety of greek, mediterranean, italian dishes, as well as traditional american including many diner staples and deli sandwiches on their menu.  from appearances there's not a lot to look at, the space is pretty barren other than a central counter and a condiment station in the corner, however the space appeared to be very clean. Our server was very attentive and polite despite being the only server, and refilled our drinks regularly.  After recently trying the also newly opened Greek Corner I was anxious to have a Gyro face-off.  I ordered the Gyro dinner which includes choice of  salad, soup or coleslaw as well as bread service.  I ordered the soup which was a chicken, rice and lemon juice soup, it was actually very enjoyable and well made.  The bread was a crisp bread served with a plate of garlic cloves in olive oil which again was not bad.  My dinner arrived with a large portion of Gyro meat, Feta and tzatziki.  Which brings me to the only thing that mildly bothered me.  

As with most greek dishes they are served with a mountainous portion of rice pilaf, this was no different however they seem to put a red I can only guess sweet marinara / tomato sauce on the rice, and not just a drizzle in the middle, my rice was pretty much drenched in what tasted like marinara.  I've had greek food hundreds of times in my life and I never recall anytime having marinara on the pilaf.  it might actually be pretty good to some, but I'm also the type when I eat spaghetti I only put a minimal amount of sauce on my spaghetti so this may just be a matter of preference.

the only reason I subtract points is because this was not stated on the menu.  Other than that the Gyro meat was generously served, thick and very tasty.  I would order the dish again but would ask they omit the sauce next time.

Additonally their breakfast menu looks very tempting, Melissa was pining over an old man's omelette at the table across from us most of the time we were there and we both plan to come back for breakfast.

Did I mention the prices. the two of us had 2 entrees including bread, soup and drinks for just over $20 the same Gyro dinner would have cost $15 at some other restaurants.  almost no dinners are more than $10, breakfast items average $5-$7 the same with lunch items.

I'm anxious to try breakfast at Nick's as well as some of their more traditional faire, and hope to add Nick's into our rotation."}
{"text":"Smaller store front diner, with a friendly staff.  They have typical \"Greek\" owned restaurant menu, which is super huge.  Breakfast is good, as is lunch.  Nothing to write home about, but much better than fast food!  And locally owned, which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"Cheap and tasty breakfast and lunch food! We love Theresa and her Sassy attitude . The omlettes are huge and the kids burger is a real burger not the kind most resturants serve kids.  And free pie on Wednesday with an entree."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for the first time today for breakfast. It was very busy but expected for a Saturday morning at 10. We were seated in about 10 minutes and promptly had water and coffee per our request from the waitress. A few minutes after that she took our order. No more than 10 minutes later our food came out. I ordered the corned beef omelette with wheat toast and the wife ordered bacon and eggs with potatoes and wheat toast. My wife ordered her bacon extra crispy and it was cooked to perfection as was everything else we received. This is some of the best breakfast we've had not only in Surprise but in Arizona all together. Everyone was extremely friendly, prompt and courteous. A man who I believe to be the owner even came to check on us. Our bill, not including tip, came to just over $23.00. My wife and I cannot wait to go back and check out lunch and dinner. We both agreed we have found our new spot."}
{"text":"I wanted breakfast for lunch & they delivered beautifully :)

The food is simple & understated, but still yummy. The atmosphere is casual & cool. I literally do mean cool, lol!  The shades are drawn & lighting is low, which is awesome when you're basically suffering from heat stroke just by walking from the your car to the restaurant door, which was only about 5 steps! Service is friendly, but during lunch they do get really busy so expect to wait your turn.

They have breakfast specials from 7 am to noonish (ask them for the exact times) BUT they do serve breakfast all day :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I had the craving for Pancakes! Boy am I glad we chose this lil place. Cause for under $13 ( not including gratuity) we got stuffed! We each ordered the #6 three huge pancakes with the choice of 4 sausage links 4 strips of bacon or ham. You walk in and as busy as they were, all the tables that were open were either clean or being cleaned. Cool atmosphere. I like how all the specials ( and there's lots) are written on a giant chalkboard that covers one of the walls. Service was quick. From the look at some of the other orders coming out it seems as if any one of them could have filled us up."}
{"text":"My new favorite place for breakfast. The potato pancakes are delish! And the bacon is super tasty."}
{"text":"I heart gyros, but am rarely happy with what I get. This place is now my go-to when I am in a gyros kinda mood. Only $6 to boot, woo hoo! 

The hubby really liked their meatloaf, which is good because the serving was a truckload. I think he liked the gyros better though. :)

The kids got... wait for it... kids' meals. The chicken strips were actually huge breast pieces in a decent breading and the cheeseburger was 
huge. 

We have been here twice now. The food and service have been really good, and I love the Mom-n-Pop ambiance. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent! The bigger server lady in the morning tho! She makes me never to want to come back. Horrible service, and a very rude person."}
{"text":"we love this place! i can't believe it took us awhile to check it out, but it's so worth it. pretty cheap breakfast. plus they have a full bar, bonus if you want a bloody mary or mimosa. food is always great & tastes fresh. we've had the same server, heather, & she's fantastic. this is definitely our new go to breakfast place."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Nick's Diner. I had heard they had very good gyros. I arrived at noon on a Sunday and the place was packed. They were serving large plates of pancakes, eggs and the like. It appears to be a very popular breakfast place.

I sat at the counter and ordered my gyro. The plate arrived and looked good. The gyro meat was pretty good, however the Tzatziki sauce was almost flavorless and the onion was too strong. Oh well, I gave it a shot. This is not the place to go for a gyro.  

On a positive note, the fries were tasty."}
{"text":"This place can be  a roll of the dice. The first time it was great and the times after not so good and one of the the waitress was kind of rude. Which led to us complaining about her attitude. Definitely do not order anything but breakfast. I say just ok. Price wise you'll keep most of your money...."}
{"text":"Yelp, you failed me on this one. I'm going to break this down  easy. 

Chicken strips-over cooked, dry, and mostly breading

Garlic parmesan fries- fries tossed in burnt garlic oil hidden under a mound of fake, processed parmesan powder

Corned beef hash- flavorless,  mushy yet at the same time burnt pieces of potatoes. 

Eggs (ordered over medium) -too runny   

Pancakes with bacon- was delicious"}
{"text":"Ritchi's Diner is a new restaurant that took over Babbo's old spot and although it's nice to have another non-chain restaurant in the area, there are much better options available.  I ordered an open faced turkey club sandwich, and I have a few complaints.  First the bread on the sandwich wasn't toasted, and it just made the bread soak up too much gravy leaving a very soggy bread with the turkey.  The vegetables clearly came from some frozen bag mix bought at Fry's or Walmart.  This leads to very disgusting tasting non-fresh vegetables that tastes more like a freezer than it does veges.  Also, because it's not fresh veges, it gets overcooked to defrost the greens and leads to even more sogginess.  Finally the mashed potatoes tasted like something from a box and lacked butter.  The poor sides is not acceptable in this day and age to be a successful restaurant.  On a positive note, the turkey and gravy were delicious.  It's a start, but for now, Richi's needs to step it up quickly."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a great breakfast! If you are hungry and want great food this is your place. As our waitress said, \"if you leave hungry, it's your own fault\". Great food and great value. Nice service and atmosphere. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This was a waste of my time.  The hostess was grumpy the but little girl at check in was sweet and helpful. But the table service was very good Theresa was fast and spot on!
The eggs were all Cooked correctly. The sausage like we're large and undercooked as well as full of soy, yuck.  The patato cakes tasted worse than bricks, frozen something. 
The plus was you get lots for your money and the prices were fair."}
{"text":"I tried Nicks Dinner 2 and was extremely disappointed. I enjoy Nicks as I tried to support local mom and pop eateries, however the service was aweful. I ordered take out and the person sounds like I was an inconvenience to them. Once I got there I understood why. As it was slow. While I stood there waiting for someone to even acknowledge me 6 employees walked past me. When I was helped I could not be helped as the individual who placed my order was somewhere else. Hence, I had to wait for that person to ring me up. Overall, it lacks to family experience of the originals Nicks. Nicks 2 is in a huge hall that when empty is alot of space for the servers to cover. Maybe you will have a better expeience than I."}
{"text":"Stopped by Nick's (transitioning to Richi's) tonight for dinner. Hostess seated me quickly. I was dining alone tonight. Victoria was my server and she was attentive and pleasant. Decided on Baked Meatloaf with veggies, coleslaw and mashed potatoes.  The veggies were a soggy lukewarm serving and not much flavor. There was ample meatloaf smothered in brown gravy. It was ok but a little salty. All in all not the best meal I've had at Nick's. I'll be sticking to breakfast."}
{"text":"New location and actually a new name.  Ritchie's Diner.   Love the chicken lemon rice soup. I could eat it everyday along with the flaming cheese.   They do a great job at making the food....... if only they had the service to back it up.   They are slow to even acknowledge us after we are seated and. It even during a busy time.   Fix the service and they will be 5 stars."}
{"text":"Nick's has potential.My husband and I took and chance and tried out Nick's a couple of weeks ago. 

The menu is diverse including a lot of mediterranean/greek choices but more traditional \"diner\" fare as well. I tried the Greek Burger which is a regular burger smothered in feta- not shabby. I will admit I was jealous of another diner's omelet and wished I would of gone for the \"breakfast for dinner\" route instead. 

We are already talking about going back to try breakfast soon and I hope more people in the area check it out and support it so it doesn't meet the same fate as so many local places in Surprise do."}
{"text":"Note:  I'm writing this review about their Gyro.  If you don't plan to get a Gyro than take this with a grain of salt.

I'm very conflicted about this review because their Hummus is really good but the Gyro was a mess.  First of all they use Kronos like most all other places, so the meat was pretty standard.  Where they lost me was the Tzatziki.  What a joke.  You might aswell put straight yogurt on the gyro.  It lacked any spices or even a hint of cucumber.  Then to make matters worse they dumped their bland Tzatziki on top of the meat.

Call it a preference but a gyro should go pita, Tzatziki , onions, meat.   Then they served bland, undercooked, generic fries.

Too boot while I ate my lunch I got to hear, what I assume is the managers or owners, discussing with a couple why they don't think that the customers credit card information was stolen at their restaurant.  

I don't know what happened but I didn't want to hear that.  All in a bad visit not likely soon to repeat."}
{"text":"Good, simply down home cooking. Simple, inviting dining room with nice dining available outside. I had spaghetti and meatballs. Very good, sauce is sweet and hearty although I missed not having garlic bread which would of been a great addition. We also had lasagna which was excellent but again missed the garlic bread. Portions are large allowing for lunch the following day and a fantastic value over all. I did take notice of extremely good breakfast deals and will absolutely return to try. Great experience. Once again, satisfaction with the little guy versus chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Finally tried Richi's Diner today, and trust me all the good reviews are true, the only thing I could wish for would be a little more seasoning on the food. I understand they are located at the gates of a retirement community and you need to cater to your base customer. The service was great from the person who seated us to the person taking our orders and refilling our drinks. The place was clean and well decorated, a lot nicer than I expected of a place calling itself a Diner. Had the Steak and Eggs, (steak was cooked to order and was seasoned well) which came with potatoes that were cooked just right, just wished they would have been seasoned (more) when cooked. Nothing the salt and pepper on the table couldn't fix up quick. I think we even seen Richi himself making the rounds and making sure guests were happy. He was a gracious host and making conversation with all the guests, joking with us while making sure we were happy and had everything we needed. I think this place we end up on the come back and try more list."}
{"text":"You can't do much better for breakfast in Surprise than Nick's. Every time I go in I have to hold back from ordering something I clearly won't be able to finish......and where to start?!?! I'd do a poor job embellishing on what others have written - all I'll say, is that you like a cooked breakfast, eat here! nom nom nom.... :)"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! Great service and fantastic food with decent prices!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here on many occasions and have never had a bad meal. Breakfast is huge and very tasty but, lunch is my favorite meal, the burgers are huge and hand made not those store bought patties, the Gyros are cooked to perfection, hint, get some extra taziki sauce to dip your fries in....yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"The sign and menus say \"Richi's Diner.\" It's in the old Babbo's space with indoor and patio dining. Friendly service, good food, offered coffee to go when we were done. What more could one want? My husband ordered the corned beef hash. It was fresh made, not the canned junk he usually gets at home. Ha! I had the Belgian waffle with sausage. The sausage was the big links that Nick's used to have. Probably the same people, but way better and friendlier service than Nick's had way back when they first opened. We tried the original Nick's several times years ago and finally quit going due to grouchy, poor service. If this is the same people, they finally got it right. Great location at Bell and Reems. It was a hit for us. I hope they keep it up!"}
{"text":"Been a couple times and just not too impressed. Food is ok, but service is lacking. It's never a place that I think of when I want to eat breakfast. The location is a bit off the street and behind a credit union. It's a smaller restaurant, but is clean and food typically comes out somewhat quick. I usually try to go a few times before I leave a review to see how things are because everyone can have off days. There's just nothing about this place that stands out for me. Don't think we will come again."}
{"text":"Always enjoy coming here. Food is Always good, fresh, and home made. Love the new location and the staff is the same as it was especially the breakfast crew. 
If you have not already tried it, be sure you do. Richie & his staff doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding Kendall was super!!!!!!! Food was great! A must try. Menu with lots to choose from."}
{"text":"This has. Come my favorite place to grab food from.  Their burgers are insanely good.  I owned a business next door but went out of business myself, still stop by to eat here though!!"}
{"text":"So Nicks is a great \"greasy spoon\" type of place. Poor, uninspired atmosphere, a few older sassy waitresses in with the younger first time servers. 
As you would expect, you have a menu with a few pictures of food; all of which don't look very appetizing.
The value is really the shining star of the place, though. Good food, really good quality, sizable portions and all at a more than reasonable price.
I visit here 2 - 3 times a month, enough to be recognized as a regular, and I will continue to support this place."}
{"text":"We've been here several times.  The weekday breakfast special is the best deal in town.  I have also been for lunch and highly recommend gyros."}
{"text":"BEST breakfast on West side.. pancakes, french toast, hash browns, coffee... Everything is delicious and fresh!!  Had lunch here the other day, Gyros are awesome! Highly recommend. Plus, I prefer to support local business owners over corporate owned places. Owner on site and very friendly. Servers are great, fast service."}
{"text":"Food is always very good but the wait staff is always standing around talking etc. hard to get their attention if you need anything such as a drink refill etc. too bad since the food is good"}
{"text":"This is not the Nick's Diner Two, on Waddell. While the menu is almost identical and the portions are generous, the service left a lot to be desired.  My buddies and I tried all the Nick's breakfast specials, the omelette, the scramble, the chicken fried steak and while portions were large, flavor was not.  I chose the scramble with gyro meat and found very little meat or taste.  Service was prompt but our server was a bit \"uninformed\".  A decent breakfast, but not necessarily a place that I would go back too."}
{"text":"Food was 2 out of 5. I felt some of there ingredients or sauces were canned or came from a jar.

Atmosphere was really bad. Felt like I was in a small school cafeteria or something.

Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast near our 2nd home in Sun City West! Good portions and depending on which waitstaff you get, pretty good service! Has a variety of menu items; Greek, Italian, And really good hamburgers with fries or/and onion rings."}
{"text":"Food was good! service sucked. From the second I walked in I felt like I was bothering them coming into the place. Then my waitress got my order wrong and argued with me over it.  It's really a shame that the service is so bad that you cannot even enjoy the food I had to wait to get a drink many times where the place is empty and the workers are just talking."}
{"text":"I'm upset we took so long to check this place out! The diner is very well decorated and feels clean and modern. Our server Heather was awesome, food came out quickly, and most of all, our breakfast tasted fresh and seemed to be made from some really good quality foods. Everything from the eggs to the toast just seemed to be better than most \"diner\" and breakfast spots we have visited around Phoenix. 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"I've only ordered 1 thing on the menu, the Greek omelette!  It's incredible, very big, contains gyro meat and feta cheese and veggies.  A must try."}
{"text":"I have eaten hear a dozen or so times.  I enjoy the food.  Some times the service is a bit inconsistent, but never had a noticeable problem.  For the prices, the quality is hard to match.  Defiantly worth a try for anyone in the area."}
{"text":"I just had a great Philly Cheese steak.  The hostess is such a nice lady. She made me feel really good with her sweat personality. My waitress Heather did a great job. This place was packed and she still gave my table a lot of attention. The food also came real fast. This is a new favorite place. Good food! Good price! Good service!"}
{"text":"So disappointing...I have been dying for an authentic NJ style Diner...it's not a lot to ask...low prices, great food...

* Not one item came out the way we requested
* Spaghetti sauce was sweet- it's not supposed to be
* Items were left off our plates b/c they assumed we didn't want them (asked for no ham on club, so they assumed we didn't want bacon either)
* Added on a soup, they took away our fries- assumed we wanted to subsitute
* Pasta was overcooked and oily : My kid threw up afterwards
* Son had a beef kabob- meat was tougher than nails"}
{"text":"This place has gotten progressively worse. The \"home fries\" are either burnt hard or chewy raw. The new menus look great but are held together with bread ties. I believe in supporting our local restaurants but this is our last time here."}
{"text":"Very very nice, friendly staff and delicious food. The owner gave me a complimentary glass of wine while I waited for my to-go order."}
{"text":"My fries have always been perfect as well as their food. My only suggestion would be to wash off the condiment bottles.  I always use a napkin to hold the ketchup bottle.  
I still eat here often"}
{"text":"We love to go every Friday because we get endless cod fish. The owner of restaurant is very professional, nice and friendly. I recommend everyone to go at this location. Food is great also. Viorel, Surprise, Az."}
{"text":"I just  walked out of Ritchie's. Waited 10 minutes after waitress took my drink order, (tea) despite there being a whole pitcher of tea sitting nearby & being shared with other wait staff. It wasn't even busy. They're usually very good, but tonite I protested with my wallet & ate across the street."}
{"text":"I have been here three times. We had a regular breakfast place back in tx and thought this might become our regular breakfast place here in AZ. Everything went fine the first couple times we ate here, good food, good specials, clean restaurant, and friendly staff. But on our last visit, after the meal I asked my waitress why my $5.59 breakfast special came out to over $8. The waitress bluntly told me it's because you had onions on your potatoes, I asked if they normally charge $2.50 for onions? And she told me yes in a very offended tone. After that short exchange her whole demeanor changed, she ignored us the rest of the time we were there and took over 30 minutes after we finished our meal to take my card to pay the bill, finally I had to just take the bill up to the counter myself and pay. I am the last person to give a business a less than favorable review because of one bitter employee, but I kid you not, when we went up to the counter every employee we saw and passed looked at us like we just shot the president. The lady at the counter never looked at me and when she finally did take my card she snatched it out of my hand and threw it back on the counter at me after she charged it, she threw the card back... My mouth dropped, I have never experienced that before, and over something as petty as me asking about the price of onions? I know you probably think I'm the douche who nit picks everything and makes every waitresses life a living hell, but I am the complete opposite. I tip very well and am nothing but friendly and courteous, but I am also going to be the first to call you out if you provide shitty service. I still left her a 20% tip."}
{"text":"Everything was OK.  We were seated promptly but the hostess forgot to bring menus. Decent food but nothing special, service was pretty good but everyone seemed sort of distracted talking with the owners at their family table.  The prices were reasonable.

A friend had warned us that this was not the best place to go, but I will probably give it another chance."}
{"text":"I can say I like Nick's for breakfast. Decent food, decent prices and they usually are spot on.They have some good choices and portions are right on. Even the small order of French toast really can be split by two people, it is alot of toast-just order an extra side of meat and you got a cheap b-fast

This past weekend I took myself to breakfst and things did not go as well as normal. I received my #2 with bacon, but alas no toast. The waitress said she would bring it in a moment. My super hot food was hard to resist so I hate a piece of bacon a couple bites of potatoes and after 5 minutes, still no toast. 

When the toast finally got there after what seemed like 10 minutes, my food was only warm then and the appeal had left me. It is hard to eat over easy eggs without toast ya know?

I have gone there for other meals too, fish and chips are good, gyro meat is good and club sandwich is good. I always order my home fries and reg, fries 'crispy' as they seem to cook them but not to my liking of crispy.I like the type of fries they have, closer to steak fries but a bit slimmer in cut. 

I did have a friend who will not go here anymore because he ordered the Friday Night all-you-can -eat special (the week before it actually started as they posted it but did not say it was starting the next week) and got a piece of fish that was still cold inside. He thought no biggie, I'll just get more fish and send this back. Well they didn't honor all you can eat AND they refused to remake the part that was cold on the inside. Just bad customer service all around on this one.  

So, I would say very good place for breakfast and lunch, dinners are good but not great and will fill the need when you want a simple, decent meal at a decent price. 
Btw, on many visits I have seen the Sheriff deputies here and the SFD getting takeout for breakfast so you know these guys like to eat good stuff."}
{"text":"Nice spot. Better location than the old one. The name was changed from Nick's to Richi's. Our waitress didn't know what was in the club sandwich. She waited for another employee to come over and advise. She was very friendly though and the menu is very large so if she's new I understand. I ended up ordering the club sandwich  since it comes with ham, turkey and bacon. I ordered it with fries. Place was pretty busy. I like that because the food must be good, right? Food was affordable."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast & was greeted, seated and had a cup of coffee right away. Asked for 2 eggs, 2 bacon & a biscuit. She said we had to select one of the menu choices. Weird! So, finally just had bacon & eggs. Had to wait quite awhile to be served & no one ever asked how everything was & we had to wave someone down for the one and only coffee refill. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Server attitudes have greatly improved. New servers are awesome.  Food is amazing.  Transition to Richi is cool he's very out front with the customers.   Among our favorites now!"}
{"text":"Second visit. I had the Denver Sandwich and it was yummy. It's a mini Denver omelet sandwiched in sourdough. The oatmeal was really good too. Served with milk, raisins, and brown sugar just added the raisins and brown sugar and it was good to go. Looking forward to another visit...soon!"}
{"text":"That is a VERY generous 2 star. Came in starving left angry and still starving. 

Ordered the fettuccini Alfredo w chicken and some lemon soup cuz I hate cold slaw.

Waited an hour for my food

The soup tasted like ass 

The dish came with no chicken 

The fettuccini was bland

Asked for chicken and waited another 35 min 

I didn't eat my dish, I didn't leave a tip, and I stole a fork. I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing.  It was OK for a breakfast I suppose, but when there are so many better options in the area, we won't be back.  The French toast had no flavor, just bread and egg.  The home fries were the same, just potatoes, no salt, pepper, or anything.  The bacon was obviously premise in bulk and left out to wait for orders, very dried out.  Just bland and plain all around."}
{"text":"Consistently good food for a good price. The owner is a really nice guy, also, and often comes out to talk to the customers. Their new location is nice, too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is a nice little diner. We were looking for a place for breakfast for my son's birthday. We live in the East Valley but we're up in Surprise visiting family for the holidays. I was kind of leery because the reviews were all over the place but decided to give it a try. The waitress was very nice and accommodating. She refilled my coffee multiple times, brought my son a cup of water because she noticed his juice was done, and brought my mom a second tea bag and pot of water. The waitress even brought crayons and coloring book pages for my 3 kids to keep them occupied while wait for our meal. At the end, she gave each kid 2 quarters so they can put it in the toy machine and get a prize. That was a hit for the kids. Food wise, I ordered the Belgium waffle and it was good. My daughter got the eggs and hash browns. The hash browns were cold, but it was also really cold outside, so not sure if it was because that was the last thing she decided to eat off her plate or if they truly weren't cook to a hot temperature. Portions were big and reasonably priced. My husband said the bacon was too salty, but my kids loved it and my mom said it was good. We will definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"It's just ok. Nothing special or great about it. Pancakes are dry and most of the food is bland"}
{"text":"My son and I were craving some chicken strips and Gyro meat to take home. We hadn't been to the original Nick's in a while. I've gotten used to restaurants not listening to what you say when you order carry out. They got our order exactly like I said and it was prompt and they treated us with as much respect as dine in customers. You'd think you can't mess up chicken strips and gyro meat right? Well I wouldn't be writing this except the gyro meat was perfect beautiful , I'd be happy with some scraps but it wasn't and the chicken strips were perfectly cooked not over or under. The quoted time was exactly what they said even though they were busy. A simple order but very well done."}
{"text":"Went to Nick's for lunch. Had a hamburger. My wife had a pita sandwich. Both were served with salad  rather than fries (our choice). Both were very tasty. Will go again."}
{"text":"My daughter comes here with her dad and grandma. She said it was great. So we checked it out. And it was amazing. Our server was great heather."}
{"text":"Horrible! Came in for breakfast about 9am. Not busy, about 5 or 6 people. Ordered bacon, eggs, potatoes and toast. All came out cold. I sent it all back and a minute later, it comes back out. not much better and still not hot. I then get to the last couple of pieces of bacon and not only where they still cold, but more raw then cooked. VERY DISAPPOINTED. That will be the last visit."}
{"text":"I don't know what Donna R.'s problem is, but her review is 100% unfair and vindictive. I eat at Nick's # 1 every day for three reasons: 1. The food is excellent, 2. The prices can't be beat, and 3. Because Theresa works there! Far from being \"rude\" or \"burned out\", she has a loyal following of customers...all of whom she treats with respect and a great sense of humor. Regulars or newcomers..they are all welcomed...and the size of your tip has nothing to do with it."}
