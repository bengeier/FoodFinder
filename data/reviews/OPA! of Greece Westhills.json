{"text":"Food over cooked, seasoning not up to Greek cooking standards. Calamari deep fried with very thick and tasteless batter. Tzasiki...  could .only tell that it was because that's what we ordered but unable to tell what it was otherwise Hope they improve so we can enjoy Greek food in our area!"}
{"text":"I first tried a gyro at the Mad Greek Cafe in Barstow, Nevada, and I'm now hooked for life.  When I got home, I looked around for a place to get a decent, inexpensive gyro to satiate my appetite.  Then Opa! Souvlaki opened in Westhills Towne Centre and answered my prayers.  For under $6, you can get a made-to-order Souvlaki Pita Wrap (translation - gyro, if you choose that flavor). First, they warm the soft pita on the flattop, then load it up it with your choice of 6 different meats, a bruchetta-type mix of tomatoes, jalapenos and onions, lettuce, and two scoops of their tasty tzatziki sauce. For 50 cents extra, you can elect for feta cheese, or even more tzatziki sauce.  The toppings are always fresh, the gyro meat is nicely spiced up and warm, and the combination of hot jalapenos and cool tzatziki is a nice balance.  Their chicken Souvlaki Pita Wrap is also divine. As well, you can choose to have a Souvlaki Platter, which comes with your choice of meat, rice pilaf, roasted potatoes, pita bread and tzatziki.  I think I just like saying \"tzatziki\" alot. I am a fan.  Opa!"}
{"text":"This Opa location is terrible!  The chicken was rock hard and dry. Greek salad had too many green peppers, pieces of onion that should be in the trash, un -ripe tomatoes (it's tomato season, come on) and very few cucumbers.  They were very un organized on the prep counter. Food was going back and forth, and then back to the cash for takeout. Customers were all bunched up because no one wanted to move to the end of the counter.  It's was a very uncomfortable experience that I don't plan to ever repeat. If I want Opa again I will go to chinook centre or the Marda Loop locations."}
{"text":"Not all Opa locations are created equal, and this one is more equal than others. I have eaten at several locations of this quickly expanding franchise, and have been shocked at the lack of consistency this franchise has. I am sure there are others that maintain  high standards, but this location is by far my favourite.   Kudos to Opa for making better Greek food in a fast food setting than I have had at many restaurants in big cities (including Toronto's Danforth strip). These guys make great salad, with fresh ingredients, crispy and lightly battered calamari, very flavourful tzatziki and, I am told by others, very tasty souvlaki wraps (with soft, savory pita bread). All the sides I have tried have been very good as well. The only thing they can improve on is their spanakopita...it is not heating up well and needs to be crispier and fresher tasting.   This location seems to be run by a very hands-on owner (or manager, who they are lucky to have, I am not sure which). He obviously takes pride in what he does and in customer service. Good job."}
{"text":"Claire G nailed her review and have to agree. This location is absolutely exceptional and I can feel the love in the atmosphere and quality of food.  They have created a feel of a family Greek restaurant with delicious fast casual food. Although the menu is standardized, it tastes better here. I think they do what they can to ensure it's fresh and the portions are fair. Momma who is often there keeps a watchful eye and the management and staff truly care. I'll be sticking to this one!"}
{"text":"For a fast food chain this is pretty good. Food is fresh and the staff are friendly. This location is worth a try."}
