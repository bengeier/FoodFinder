{"text":"Great little place! Grilled cheese was yummy and the chocolate-jamocha shake was fantastic! The owner was very friendly and helpfully explained the choices on the menu. Will be back!
UPDATE: Second experience was as good as the first! Great hamburger and the best raspberry shake around!"}
{"text":"Ordered burger and fries. Fries from freshly cut potatoes.  Burger tasty and sufficiently cooked. Food was served in about 5 min.  Decent value for just under 8 dollars. Napkins at all the tables as well as salt and pepper. Temperature inside comfortable.  Was pleased."}
{"text":"We were impressed!!!  Our burgers were hot and juicy.  The buns were toasted and warm. The toppings on the hamburger was fresh, cool and crisp.  Then there are the fries.  Homemade, hand cut fries like the ones back home.  The owner - all smiles and was happy to have us.  While this isn't down the street from us, I expect we will be frequenting this hidden jewel often!  

By the way- was going to take a picture of the food for yelp but I had eaten most before I remembered - it was sooooo good!!!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular weekly customer here at Moe's Burger. It was Lenny's Burger before Moe Sabouhi took over the business. I'm grateful for him taking over the business. He makes my burger the way I specified it (in the right layer order). The French fries are delicious. I love'em without salt. Once you're a regular customer, Moe and the staff will take very good care for you. It's a children and family friendly environment. Nothing can go wrong ! One of the places that still carries Thrifty ice cream . Amazing ice cream and shake selections. If you're a first timer here at Moe's, start with their Philly's Cheesesteak. Their burgers are amazing. The prices are decent for the food they serve. Moe usually serve more fries than the fry bag can hold. If there is one or two things that I wish this place would offer on their menu, it'll definitely be sweet potato fries and a Gyro sandwich. Plus, pepper jack cheese would be great to add to the cheese selections."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in along time. My meal was perfect! Just what you want a good old fashion burger to taste like. No gourmet aioli or artisan crafted what have you's. Just a damn good burger. Perfectly seasoned patty, fresh lettuce, red onion,tomato, pickle, bacon and American cheese on a sesame bun.  Large quantity of  freshly cut fries and a drink. A truly satisfying  dining experience.  After my first bite one thought  passed through  my mind. GOD BLESS AMERICA!  There's just something  wonderful  about an American classic done right.  In the words of Arnold  Schwarzenegger  \"I'LL BE BACK\""}
{"text":"This was Lenny's now called moes. Honestly nothing seems to have changed same menu and food. Came I  for lunch good food. Prices aren't bad and u get enough burger and fries. I enjoyed it. Just be prepared it is a lil cramped and only 1 person at a time for bathroom."}
{"text":"FAVORITE BURGER PLACE the burgers are massive for the price and it just gives such classic diner feels. Will be returning often"}
{"text":"Very casual little spot along downtown street, easy to get in and order a burger or sandwich. They have a good selection of food including sundaes and milkshakes. Service was very nice."}
{"text":"So I wondered into Downtown Glendale to kill some time and enjoy the last day of my winter break. After walking around a bit I stumbled onto this little gem. The young girl at the register was helpful in suggesting the Philly cheesesteak, and I am stoked that I listened to her. This was the best cheesesteak I have ever had in my life. The fries were fresh and I got a large soda as well. All for a little over $9. You cannot beat that. It's just an awesome little hole in the wall diner, no frills which is what I love. I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME.  Delicious chili burgers. Delicious fries. All they need to add to their menu is gyros."}
{"text":"Burgers were delicious, nice juicy patties and nice bun. Only problem was the fries were a little oily. Overall solid burger joint!"}
{"text":"After leaving a terrible place around the corner. We decided to come here for lunch. We'd been here a few years back and remembered how delicious our meal was. Well we were right. Still super flavorful burgers and enough fries for 2 in one of their combos. I had the ranch burger and added the avocado, grilled onion and mushroom. It was just like I make it at home. It was a large burger. And the tons of fries, neither of us were able to finish. The owner was nice and attentive. The food came out fast and delicious . We'll be stopping by more often."}
{"text":"We were needing to kill time in Glendale so looked for a lunch place. With great reviews, we decided to try Moe's. So glad we did! Great burgers and fries are fresh cut with skins. The best kind. Next time we will add a shake since those looked good. Don't let the outside change your mind. Cute and quaint inside like an old diner. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really good little place in downtown Glendale. The cheese fries are my kids favorites and I love the mushroom burger. Decent prices and great food."}
{"text":"Just disappointed. Showed up as Lenny's on Yelp. Already standing at counter ready to order when I realized it was Moe's. Still has Lenny's awards on wall. NOT the same. Burger quality average. Fries were good. No ice tea. Pepsi fountain products. Worst part: gnats flying around window seat at inside table."}
{"text":"Great burgers! The country burger with thousand island was delicious! Can't beat toasted buns :).  The peanut butter shake was incredible!!!! We got to meet Mo himself, very nice guy!  Needless to say we left stuffed and satisfied!"}
{"text":"Everything they say in Yelp is true! Amazing Burger awesome onion rings and yummy fries! Definitely worth the drive across town. This is a classic hole in the wall with immaculately clean dining area. Dinner for 2 under $25!!"}
{"text":"Was looking for an old fashioned diner with a good burger. Moe's nailed it. Cute little dive. Sat at counter with great attention from server. We had teriyaki/Swiss burger and ranch burger. They were fresh, grilled and good sized. Soft, fresh buns. Hand cut fries. Shakes looked good too."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for another burger. It was awesome. Just like some of our favorites in California. Thank God not we don't have to drive 8 hours to get one we have them here in our own back yard."}
{"text":"Awesome little find! Really good burgers. Got that country burger and it came with fries and a drink. If you remember Lenny's, then this is that place for you."}
{"text":"I had this place in my bookmarks for a while and I'm so glad we finally tried it. My husband got a cheeseburger with grilled onions and bacon, I had a burger with thousand island and the basic toppings, we got a jr burger for our 1.5 yo daughter and we shared fries and small onion rings. And of course I got a chocolate shake!

The service was great. The woman at the counter was nice and took our order accurately. The food came out fast and hot. Most importantly, the food was delicious. My husband commented on how good the grilled onions were right away. Like another reviewer, we lived in California and this burger really does stand up to their great mom and pops.

Go today. Get all the food. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Moe's is one of the best spots in Glendale. Diner food with very reasonable prices, always guaranteed fresh. Moe is always there when I've stopped by and is very friendly and assistive in choosing the right food selection. I personally recommend the Patty Melt w/ Fries. And a large Banana/Cinnamon Malt (best milkshake/malt ever... hands down). Shout out to Moe for not converting to Lenny's burgers either!"}
{"text":"Got the hickory burger and added bacon. Wow! The BBQ sauce was perfect taste and temp, bacon was flavorful, lettuce was ice cold and crisp, fries were good! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place had amazing food! The burgers were on point and you have to try the zucchini!! It's mind blowing delish!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars got me to this place. We had to try this place with all the awesome review. We ordered 1lb teriyaki burger , 1/4 cheese burger, chili cheese hotdog, both bbq and mild wings, and onion rings. Fries were fresh cut, not crispy but pretty tasty, onion rings were like most burger joints, chili cheese hotdog would have been great if the chili wasn't cold and bun would have been soft. Burgers were a big disappointment, very dry and bland that my husband and son didn't finish half of their burger. We might came at bad time right after lunch rush but we hope we could've experienced what others did."}
{"text":"Where to begin...I love a good ol fashion burger. Moe's nailed it. Nice size patties cooked the way you like it. I ordered a ranch burger with grilled onions and cheese. OMG...To die for!!! The fries are delicious. Fresh cut, seasoned perfectly. While sitting in the restaurant, I noticed all the awards on the wall said Lenny's Burgers. I didn't ask, but I can only assume they're one in the same, but either way, I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Big tasty burger with alot of fries. Milkshakes are really good too. Not expensive at all either."}
{"text":"Honest burger shop with good service and price.  Quaint clean. Burger was good thrifty ice cream. They even decorated for the holidays and had Christmas music."}
{"text":"Ordered the 1lb burger and could not finish it!! Soooo big, pricing is reasonable, and it was delicious!! I did need to split it with a friend, because it is a huge delicious burger. Now if your super hungry and are up to the challenge , this will most definitely fill you up. Customer service was phenomenal over the phone when ordering and in person when picking it up.  I am an extremely picky eater and most places get my orders wrong, but this place got it spot on! Thank you!! Definitely continuing to order from this place during our work hours since it's sooo close."}
{"text":"Burger was great. It tasted like a BBQ burger. I enjoyed the fries, but they could have used seasoning. Salt was at the counter so easy fix. My raspberry tea tasted awful as if it had been sitting in the machine a while. Service was quick and my daughter enjoyed her hotdog and fries."}
{"text":"I had business in the area and I walked right by this cute little burger and hot dog shop. Sadly, I was not very hungry but I was curious, thus I zoomed in. I ordered just a small burger minus the mustard. Every Foodie, New Yorker knows it is a pure sin to put mustard on burgers. LOl-

I was rather surprised that my hamburger was absolutely delicious. It reminded me of the grill cooked, outside, summer charcoal,  BBQ tasting burgers of my youth before we mass produced everything. I will definitely go back when I have a bigger appetite. 

Oh yeah, the staff were very nice too. 

The Best of Awards on the wall make me think this is the person who started the original Lenny's Burger. I never understood the todo and thrill over Lenny's. Maybe he decided he liked the smaller venue not mass produced. Either way it was really great!"}
