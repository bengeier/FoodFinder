{"text":"Nice place, games for younger kids, bar like feel for adults, missing the mark for teens; we tried hot dogs, burgers, sample platter, a little on the salty side, but otherwise OK.  Come early to avoid crowds/lines."}
{"text":"My kids and I were looking for somewhere nearby to go bowling and stumble on flip side. The bowling prices are a little higher than your average bowling joint but for what it offers I think it's worth it. The bowling alley is very clean and new. They offer lane service and the employees are generally very friendly. The kids also had a great time at the large arcade."}
{"text":"Warning!  Unlimited bowling is not UNIMITED.... was part of a large group that purchased unlimited bowling for a time block saturday night.  But two hours into our unlimted bowling our games were shut off and an employee rudely came into our area and started putting out bowling balls away.  No one knew what was going on because we were suppose to have unlimted bowling till close.  The managers said since they had a waiting list of people who purchased unlimted bowling that they ended our games.    They were rude and kept trying to explain the small print of their unlimited bowling and would not listen to us explaining that it is false advertising to call it UNLIMITED bowling when there are limitations to it.    I use to like this place but probably one of the worse customer experiences I have ever had.   This was a large group planned event and they could care less that they were losing he business of 16 people that all paid for unlimited bowling.  I will never say anything good about this place ever again and will tell everyone i know to never go there.    Good job flipside you just lost my business."}
{"text":"This place is one of the few family fun parks in the east valley and has the potential to be really fun for both adults and kids. Unfortunately, it's not. Something is ALWAYS shut down or broken but they don't tell you until AFTER you've paid money to play/bowl etc. This has happened on 2 out of 3 visits here over the last 2 months. The first time we paid for cosmic bowling but the lights were broken on the lane we were given and we were told to basically deal with it or wait an hour for another lane (after paying of course!) The second time 2 of the 4 lanes in the mini bowl area were out of order (no signs and no one told us) and the other lanes were occupied with multiple families. Each time I've tired to discuss my frustrations with an employee, or worse, a \"Manager\", they don't attempt to understand your feelings and tell you to use your money towards another attraction. Bryan was the least helpful of all so far! As another side note, the restrooms are always filthy and getting so much as a soda or snack can take 45 minutes or more. My kids love this place but this will probably be my last visit due to the lack of care for the place and the major lack of concern from management and employees for their patrons."}
{"text":"If you are a bowler, it will take some adjusting. Friendly management, friendly staff, good food. They have lots of parties so check for sticky surfaces. Had problems with approaches,  seem to be fixed now. Turned AC down much cooler."}
{"text":"This place was a lot of fun. It's brand new so its super clean,  no broken games, and the bowling shoes are almost new so the thought of using them isn't so gross. I was pleasantly surprised at their menu choices in the restaurant area. Even the pickiest eaters can find something they will enjoy. They even make their own pizza crust in the dining area so you can see them stretching the dough. The kids loved to watch that. The kids also enjoyed the milkshakes made with real ice cream.   The price of admission was less than other places that compare, like Amazing Jakes. They DO NOT charge an entrance fee for the parents and the packages are priced reasonably.  All in all the kids loved it and the parents appreciated the cleanliness, the price,and selection of games and activities for the kids.  This is a great new edition to the East Valley and we will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Excellent place to take your kids for a few hours to burn off energy. Great for adults to sit relax and have a beverage. Nice experience for the whole family."}
{"text":"We had bday party here in the java room-14 kids with 25 chaperones.   We did the 3 attraction package for 8 kids & ended up adding on 5 kids at $16 each to this. We ordered 3 extra pizzas & 2 nachos & purchased 8 extra drink cups at $2.50 each. I think we spent $450 with tax & tip   It was a lot of fun but seems super pricey  Wish they had party packages for bigger groups      Pizzas were huge & delish- ordered 2 too many pizzas probably   We did loose a game card & the gm Clint comped us one- that was super cool   The reason I am giving this only 3 stars is because I feel like it was too expensive with all the ad-ons & it would have been nice if they allotted free soda for everyone   They won't even let you bring in water & only sell cups    The kids had a blasts- especially the 4-8 year age range    I probably would come back when my daughter is 8 or 9 (great age to appreciate attractions) and just do a smaller group of kids to make it more affordable & easier to manage"}
{"text":"Buyer beware!  They are running a \"special\" where if you buy 3 unlimited 3 hour passes you get a 4th for just a few dollars more that you can use anytime in the future.  I took advantage of this offer and when I came back to use the card (which never left my wallet)- they accused us of using it the day prior and said it was no good. Total guilty until proven innocent approach, which did not make for a good experience.  Staff is young which I get, but Management didn't do much to make this unpleasant situation better either.  I understand since they are new, and still working out some of the processes, but customer service should never be sacraficed along the way."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times now, once for a birthday party, other 2 times for fun with the kids. The food is not great, i have had nothing that I would want again from here. My sons loved it tho and i felt safe letting my kids run around and play. It is a bit pricey, but when you have boys you will pay anything to keep them happy. Best part for us adults is the fact that they have kiltlifter on tap ha ha!"}
{"text":"I have been to Flipside several times in the past couple of years and it just seems to get better every time I go. After reading some of the older reviews, I felt compelled to chime in.  The bowling lanes are the best in town and very well maintained. I always have a great time playing laser tag with my college-age son and he loves it too. The arcade has got some great new games that I haven't seen anyplace else in town.  I have always loved their pizza but I have been pleasantly surprised at how good everything else I have tried is. I know they had a rough start with the food but it seems like they've got it right now. I have never been disappointed with anything I have ordered.  I have really noticed improvement in the lounge. They have a good beer selection and a much cooler crowd then in the past. I think word must be getting around, I hear they didn't serve alcohol when they first opened but they do now. The karaoke on Fridays is pretty fun to watch, though I am not really a singer.  I see a lot of people bagging on the service in other reviews but I've always found it to be top notch. Any issues I have had, the staff has worked hard to make it right. Overall, I really like coming to flipside and I find it a great place to hang out with my friends when we are looking for something to do."}
{"text":"Took my nephew here for his birthday and had a blast! They have lots of arcade games, bowling, mini bowling, laser tag, and a laser maze like a Mission Impossible movie or something. Very clean and very fun!"}
{"text":"Our second trip to FlipSide on Thanksgiving weekend was a blast! Compared to the other \"family attractions\" spots in the Phoenix area that we've visited, this one is by far the best.  It's a fairly low bar - some other local spots had broken arcade games, dingy surroundings, confusing price menus, and limited fun - but this place hit it out of the park. I never thought I'd applaud a business for just being clean and functional, but really, it must be hard to do, because FlipSide is the only one who's able to keep it that way!  Some of the attractions are really unique; the laser maze is really fun and mini bowling is great for all ages. We didn't try the regular bowling because the other stuff kept us busy. (We had two adults and an 8 year old boy.) FlipSide is staffed well - attendants at every attraction and they seemed to be doing a good job. The place felt safe and well-kept.  I've been a bit surprised that FlipSide isn't busier; I hope it succeeds for the long haul! The lack of alcohol probably plays a role (from the look of the SkyClub area, I had assumed it had a bar but it doesn't).  We spent every minute of our three-hour pass at FlipSide - we burned off a ton of energy and were ready for bed by the time our night was over!"}
{"text":"Had my sons 8th birthday party at flip side on May 21.  We purchased the great escape package.  They include a \"teenager\" i.e. Room attendant who helps to orchestrate the chaos.  The package includes a room for an hour and then attractions for an hour.  The room was nice and big, but you get pushed out pretty quickly so they can set up next party.  The attractions packages are a rip.  I think my son got through one laser tag and had to wait in line at the bumper cars for 30 minutes, because they had to switch out a few bumper cars... The lazer maze was another disappointment... My wife attempted to go through the laser maze with my son... Waited in line told the teenager that she wanted to go in with my son as a duo..Finally got in there and the stinking card expired...Bummer.  Honestly I think you stand in line longer than you actually get in attractions...Also the birthday room girl was tipped twice, which was more of a communication breakdown between my wife and I, but possibly a slight integrity issue on the teenager room attendant.   Overall meh...room is nice, but expect total chaos, maybe you get 1 or 2 attractions for the kids, and that is all you get for $300 plus ( which includes double tip)"}
{"text":"Me and my two nieces, boyfriend, brother & his two boys went there to bowl one night. We were sooo excited that a bowling alley opened up right down the street from our house!! We couldn't wait to go!! Well... now we arent sure we'll ever go back.   First of all, no alcohol. Now, we aren't a bunch of alcoholics, but when the kids are all bowling it's nice to have a cocktail or two and chat amongst the adults. & if we just want to go on a date night... it'd be nice to have a cocktail then, too! But oh well, we got past that part.  I understand this is a new place & it will probably get better as time goes on but WOW, I think I know more about serving than our actual server... inexperienced joke.  The service wasn't exceptional, but the food was pretty darn good I must say! The only thing is that when you order the boneless wings (which were delicious), make sure you aren't expecting any extra wing sauce because they DONT SERVE IT. What??? It says on the menu, ask for an extra dipping sauce to go with your wings! Yet... they don't even have sides of BBQ sauce... what a crock!!!   This place pretty much just pissed me off all night long, but the kids had a good time so I guess theyre doing something right...."}
{"text":"If you are at all serious about bowling, this place is not for you. The Lanes were dry and Lane Maintenance Manager Admitted they hadn't been oiled for a few days, which was hugely obvious. The Staff was polite but under trained. Prices are outrageous, 5 bucks a game is very unreasonable especially for poorly maintained lanes."}
{"text":"I took the grandkids here for some weekend fun.  They had a great time and so did I.  I want to go back though and try out those weird looking hover crafts.  We did the kids bowling, arcade, laser obstacle course, and the indoor play ground.  We came back a week or so later for a work party .... and bowled 3 lines.  Had a great time.  My only complaint was that their snack bar shut down around 9:10 ... and we wanted something to eat.  However, all we could get was drinks ...and just barely ... they were taking the fountain down soon."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time we have brought the kids here.  On the pricey side but I like the fact that they don't take advantage of the busy mom who forgot to bring socks.  They sell them here for $2. Nice.   Now, I'm a mom of 2 boys so I understand the meaning of stink... However, something has to be done about the locker room smell.  Ugggg.  Does not make me hungry for the pizza.  Get that figured out and it'll be great!"}
{"text":"Clean...food is good...activities are cool....but they will nickle & dime you to death. Way too expensive. The manager and some employees are tools. The managers seem angry. They begin by tell us that we are wrong. I won't be returing. It's amazing how one bad experience with an employee or manager can make you want to not want to return.....as well as tell all your friends not to go to Flipside in Gilbert,  AZ."}
{"text":"Everything was clean and well organized! I was somewhat impressed with this place until I went into the laser tag. 4 kids running the laser tag area and goofing around before we even started playing. Then all 4 goofballs ended up playing laser tag which seemed pretty unfair to the little kids. Would probably go back if it had a more employee friendly atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Only thing great about this place was the family we shared booths with. Charged me for show rental even though I had my own. Our lane wasn't working the whole time, when the pins were set there would be pins missing. Had to reset about 10-15 times within our 2 and half games before we left. Even went to the front desk to tell them and also mention how gross the restrooms were. They responded with, \"oh those aren't suppose to be used.\" Confused as to why they are unlocked and accessible to that room if they aren't supposed to be. Attached are some pictures of the condition of these restrooms. Service wasn't the best, when they want you to leave they make it know.  Our entire lane shut off and had to have them turn it back on, while vacuuming and staring at up while we played. Wouldn't recommend this place, unless you don't care about being the person that doesn't mind walking up to the desk 10x."}
{"text":"Horrendous experience! Felt cheated and disrespected. From lack of experience, lack of leadership, lack of basic customer service skills, malfunctioning/non functioning equipment (game machine and laser tag gun), we tried our best to have a nice family evening with our group of 13 (children and adults). This place is so shady. The management and workers deceive patrons. They not only made us wait about an hour while we called ahead and were told to come between 9-9:30, they then put us on an fake waiting list,  and conveniently made us wait until the rates changed.  Whether someone spends $1 or close to $300 like we did, and whether a child has an issue or an adult, Mr. Manager of the evening, you epically failed. Your incompetence is reflected consistently throughout this establishment."}
{"text":"Really great place! They were a little late with the fries and they gave them to us for free! Family really bonded tonight!"}
{"text":"I haven't reviewed anything in a while but felt compelled to do so now. My daughter recently had her 12th bday party here, which was our very first time ever patronizing Flipside. From start to finish everyone - adults & kids - had a fantastic experience. The parties started out in the party room - which if you've ever had a bday party at a 'play venue' it's usually the opposite. You play first, then end up in the party room. I think I preferred it this way with 12-year-olds, with younger kids it may be hard to keep them wrangled in a room with all the lights  & action happening outside. This worked great for us. We had 2 hosts in the party room and they took charge with the kids, allowing parents to do their catching up. One hostess in particular was really fantastic interacting with the kids, talking & engaging. However, both were great! After food & cake (cake I was able to bring in) the hostess gave out wristbands and token cards and they were let loose! There was not a shortage of entertainment. My daughter chose not to include bowling in her party package, as that really wasn't her thing, but there were games, play area with climbing and different levels, crash pods, laser maze and most importantly Laser Tag! Some of the parents got into the action as well and all of us couldn't get enough of the Laser Tag. So. Much. Fun. With the wristbands we were able to bounce around from all the attractions during our time. The game cards were very convenient because as you won 'tickets' or 'tokens' you don't have to deal with anything from the machine - they were just added to your game card. When you were done playing then you take your card to the prize counter and they read the card for the token amount. So easy. For the parents that just wanted to lounge while their kids played, there's a great lounge area to hang out in, and they chatted, ate more of the food or cake, had a drink or accessed FlipSide's WiFi for their phones. Every parent said they all had a great time! This was a birthday success, and we've been back since for a Best Deal Pass. I've recommended FlipSide to lots of my friends too and emphasized how much fun the Laser Tag."}
{"text":"The most enjoyable bowling alley in town hands down!! Its very clean, TVs as big as a house,  unusually great food, never have had to wait for a lane and all of the employees are always fun and energetic...tonight the duo at the front desk were singing whatever was playing overhead which made for a great 1st impression!!!  THE MAC AND CHEESE HOT DOG W/BACON IS A MUST TRY!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero star I would, they deserve nothing. I have been here multiple times and it is worthless. That last time I attended I made the decision to never step foot in this place again. I went with my boyfriend one afternoon, it was not busy at all. We were bowling and waiting and hour before someone came over to ask us if we would like to order anything. And the only reason they asked was because the waitress's family started a game of bowling in the lane next to us. I was outraged, I went and asked for the manager. Come to find out the group of people that were standing in a circle and chatting, one of them was a manager. He was so unprofessionalism. He did nothing for us. We finished our game and left. We wrote a review on Facebook and was personally contacted by someone higher up. We wanted nothing they had to offer. All it took was for the employees to do their job, which is why they are paid to be there in the first place. Worst customer experience ever. To this day I will not recommend or step foot back in the building. Don't waste your time here"}
{"text":"Love love love their food here. Had a wonderful experience and the staff has gone above and  beyond my expectations thank you so much, Flipside! Definitely will be recommending to everyone I know."}
{"text":"After a 40 plus minute drive I can honestly say it was well worth the drive. I love this place, oh the kid does to!!! So wherever you live in the valley its worth the drive. I will write  more now that we are home. We each got the 3 hour unlimited card.  We did the Laser Tag and Laser Maze twice.  Mini bowling once the kid did not like that so much.  We both loved the Crash Pods and did them at least 5 times.  Needles to say she spent a lot of time in the Blast Pad, I spent a fair amount of time in there as well..lol  Plus with the 3 hour pass you get  $5 on your card for the Arcade. We even found time to eat!!!"}
{"text":"I'm sure if you take your kids here they will love it. My husband and I just went to bowl. Having never been there before we didn't realize that it was not your average bowling alley. The music was very loud disco with black lights flashing everywhere. It was really dark in there and while their balls glow in the dark we brought our own so it was hard to see where it was going. There's huge tv screens at the end of the lanes that play some music videos but A LOT of commercials...oh then tennis came on for a bit. It was really distracting and I didn't appreciate all the ads. It was truly sensory overload which I totally blame on my low scores!  Plus an employee had to keep going down to the end of the lanes by way of a walkway and since we had an end lane it was annoying. He didn't time his walk bys very well and he'd walk by right when someone was throwing the ball. Don't they teach bowling etiquette?!  I doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"Had a family adult b day party here last night. Had a great time but very expensive! $ 17 for a pitcher of beer, $20 for a large salad, etc.  No dinner plates for serving our pizza and salad. They only had very small cake plates!  Unlimited soft drinks were included in our adult party package, however these were served in child sippy cups! Would never recommend this for anything but a child's birthday. Very disappointing considering we spent over $400!!!"}
{"text":"Overall we had a mixed experience there.  The facilities for bowling are very nice, with nice couches to sit on and everything seems to be new or well maintained.  Staff was nice and relatively attentive although at least once we had to go find our server.  The two complaints that I had were: 1) We tried to redeem a  coupon that basically said \"family pizza and bowling for $50 for up to 6 people\".  Instead we got some kind of discount on the bowling price and then a voucher to take to the server but it didn't  seem to count for anything since we still seemed to pay full price for the pizza.  I tried asking for an explanation of  what was intended by the coupon and it seemed like they were telling me that the bowling and food were managed by two different entities.  Overall it didn't ruin our fun but it made it feel like something is out of wack there.  2) Probably not a surprise but the arcade area is just ridiculously expensive for the silly games they have.  I think we bought a $10 card for the kids to play with and was used up in a matter of minutes.  If we go back, we'll definitely skip that."}
{"text":"Love this place! During the summer there is this awesome deal from 10-4 and for $23 it's all you can play bowling, lasertag, laser maze and the jumping castle. We have gone every Monday and had a blast! At one point the laser tag was shut down for an hour for photos and the manager went above and beyond to take care of us, thanks again!!!"}
{"text":"A review for parents with tweens and who may be beer drinkers. First of all they don't have beer. Which is fine, it really is, if you are going for your kids. We took our boys 9 & 12 and their friends for the 12 year old's birthday. We didn't hold the party there we just went after a movie, dinner and cake. I think the boys had fun. We bought a card for each boy with maybe five attractions and $3 worth of game that came to about $15 each. The boys could use the bumper cars, laser tag, laser maze, and the jungle gym (they were too old). They liked the laser tag but said Stratum was better. They enjoyed the bumper cars but only chose to do it once. They did the laser maze more than once, they could go in together and it was a challenge. The only problem was the confusion getting in. They use their card to access the attractions if the attendant moved, like went to go flirt with the girls at the counter which he did every chance he got, the kids would walk up and swipe their card and try and get in. The attendant would notice get them out but then they were out an attraction. Our birthday boy did this, we had he card refilled but the girl didn't do enough and it was a hassle. They have high school kids working everything and need more adults or better training.   They have good games about $1 or more each play and you get tickets to get cheap toys like at Peter Piper etc.   All in all, it was a good experience and very pretty by the bowling alley, looks exactly like a cool bar without the booze. Lots of tv's, places to sit, bowling lanes and a coffee shop. It's nice but fairly  pricey for an hour of fun for the kids. I want them to succeed just because they are local folks but they need something else to get us there more often."}
{"text":"Such a bummer. We came here Saturday night. Not knowing what to expect, we bought bowling and two unlimited passes for the kiddo attactions. Service at the lanes was slow and they were not busy. The unlimited passes included access to the laser tag, laser maze, toddler gym, etc. Well, after being charged $80 for entry ( 4 people to bowl for 2 hours) we decided to let the kids go use their passes on the laser tag, etc. When we got over to that area, it was all shut down for the night ( 40 minutes early). It was very disapointing for the kids. They waited for us to be done bowling so they could go play. Very upsetting to young children and we went there for the family atmopsphere and will not be returning.  It is very pricey and we could have had just as much fun at the Brunswick lanes for half the price. Not what I expected."}
{"text":"Since my last review service has improved. The bowling alley is pushing hard to draw leagues. My wife and I enjoy bowling there and feel welcome as league bowlers."}
{"text":"First time here and what a rip-off. I don't know how they stay in business. Just paid nearly $50 for 2 kids upgraded passes of what they said was an unlimited everything pass. I asked several times if it covered everything and all times I was told yes. Well my boys went to use the game cards for the arcade games and they did not work. Went back to the cashier only now to be told that the everything pass does not include the arcade games. I said that the other cashier told me that it was for everything to only to be told \"sorry for the confusion\" and that I needed to purchase a seperate card to play the arcade games. \"Really\", I dont think so. We will not be back..."}
{"text":"Having brought my kids here on several occasions, my son decided he wanted his birthday party here. He only wanted to invite 3 of his friends, so we decided the best deal would be to have his friends meet us and pay for a all day pass which allows the kids to play on the attractions. They do have party rooms which include pizza and drinks, but it for a minimum of 10 kids, so for us, it wasn't cost effective to do this. The all day pass attractions. Attractions are a big climbing jungle gym with balls inside that the kids can put in air guns and shoot, \"Crash Pads\" which are like bumper cars, and laser tag. The pass also includes bowling. The one thing that is t included in the all day pass is the video games. The games are about $1 or up a game. You need to get a card at the front desk and pay for how much money you want to put on there. There's a station inside the gaming area where you can reload it if you want. For our Kid's party, we decided to put a small amount of money on each kids' card just to let them try a few games out. It would be hard not to at least give them a game option since the games are front and center when you walk in; its a hard temptation for kids to resist. The cards are also used when you buy the attraction passes, since they need to have them scanned before entering an attraction. The same card can be used for the arcade if you add money and also for the admission to the attractions. I bought a  .50 wrist cord for each kid to wear and help prevent them from losing it. I also wrote their names on the cards and gave them to them as they came in. The employees were very helpful and friendly! We were able to bring in a cake of our own which was nice. I also brought in disposable cups, plates, and utensils as well. On the invites, I slated the time for 2 hours, but we mostly stayed past that because the kids were having so much fun. It's nice because the passes are able to be used until they close. I had the kids play at the attractions and video games for about an hour and a half then we all went over to the bowling lanes. We also had the cake there which worked out nice because they have benches and tables right next to lanes."}
{"text":"Over priced, lacking customer service, very poor quality of food with extremely long wait times, filthy ball pit area and just a great disappointment."}
{"text":"So we went to flip side about 4 months ago and it was dead! Very cool place though. We played the arcade games and did laser tag. We ate at the restaurant and they have a good menu and the food was delicious! We love the  Huge screens over the bowling lanes!! We asked why theey didnt have a lot of business that friday night and we  were told that they dont serve alcohol and many people dont go for that reason.       Well... a few mos later we just returned to use our Groupon on a Friday night and the place was packed and they are in the works of getting a license to serve alcohol. The down fall is they have young teens working as servers and they suck!!!! They pretty much neglect you! We had to walk to restaurant from the bowling lanes to get our refills. We walked to the restaurant to order a snack because the server never returned. There was a birthday party at the lane next to us and they left and 20 min later a new couple shows up to bowl in that lane and the birthday trash and cups and all that was still there. I had to tell someone to clean it!  Why would you fill a lane and make them stumble over a party mess! Its not cheap to bowl here!   I believe this place could make a killing and its great for the area but needs work! The server staff needs HUGE HELP!!!!! These young girls and guys have no idea how to serve with good service! They need to turn the music up so you can actually hear it.. Need more up to date and good mix of songs.. Lots of super outdated music. Overall its a great place with a few needed fix ups!"}
{"text":"Over the last 2 years this place has gone downhill.  25% or more of the arcade games don't even work - some machines have been out of order for months.  The kiosks in the arcade to load cash have been out of service for months.  Staff seems unmotivated and the place overall seems to lack management.  We always enjoyed bringing the family here, very sad to see the decline.  Ownership needs to come in and clean this place up because there are better options in town at this point."}
{"text":"Terrible!  I am 43 years old and would like to bowl with the lights on at 7:30pm.  If I wanted to go to a nightclub, I'd head to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I have split feelings about this place. i had a great time, with a great crowd.. but when we initially came, and had a reservation - the people behind the counter asked us to get in line. But.. we had a reservation. So in line we had to get, which was weird.   But as far as the bowling went, it was completely adequate. As I said, I had a great time. We played way longer than expected until they closed and threw us out (as they should, we should respect their hours of operation).   So some good with the bad. What can I say?"}
{"text":"This was some of the worst customer service I've experienced. Slow and rude employees. Stood in line for an unnecessary duration of time for shoes and lane purchase. Bowling lane wouldn't register score, and it took us asking three different employees to fix it before anything was done. After 30 minutes of waiting around with no help and condescending comments, we asked for a refund. We were first denied and told us he would seek out the senior manager. Another 10 minutes pass before someone in my group got up to confront management themselves. They told our group the refund would take 3-5 business days. We still haven't been refunded and it's been 8 business days! So many other options, don't go here."}
{"text":"FlipSide has hands down the best laser tag I have ever been too! It was a little bit out of the way but well worth the drive! We went at night and it was just our group playing laser tag that made it even more fun! We also tried their laser maze that flipSide has and that was a riot! Definitely worth going!"}
{"text":"Review for party services.   Recently we had my son's birthday party here. The 3 star rating is primarily because of the communication issues before the actual event. The first time I called, I talked with Barry who informed me he was new and didn't know too much about the services they offered; he asked me to call back when Clint came in.  I called back, spoke with Clint and he was not very forthcoming with information either.  He answered my questions, but didn't explain too much of the party process. I talked to other various people before I was e-mailed my actual contract (which seemed to be a lengthy process). I called the day before our event and talked to yet another woman, who was very helpful and went through what to expect as far as the party room & helpers, attractions, drinks, refills, food, and adult beverage cups (for the parents who wanted to stay). It was the most information I had received.  The actual party was ok. It started on time and the party helpers were wonderful. They kept everything on track and were able to \"control\" the 10 hyped up boys for our party. They explained the attractions to the boys and their card/tickets. They took the boys to the first attraction, (laser tag) then all hell broke loose. After the first attraction, the 10 boys went in different directions, which was fine, but there was no way I could keep an eye on all of them. It was literally a free for all. Luckily, our party was early in the day, but it started getting busier as the day went on.  So, if you are a person who worries about leaving your kid in a building full of \"strangers,\" this is probably not the place for you or you would definitely want to stay with your child during a party they attended. One child got done with his 5 attractions and $10 card, and still had an hour left before his parent picked him up. He had to pretty much stay in the blast pad until his parent came. Needless to say, I was glad when the party was over. (I think that is pretty common with any birthday party.) Not a terrible experience, but not an overly great one either."}
{"text":"Second time here. Place is super clean. Much busier than last time. Probably because it was overcast and rainy. This place keeps getting better! Pizza was awesome, they changed something, for the better. It was like a slice of real quality pizzeria pizza not your average run of the mill bowling alley pizza. And the restaurant was clean, but really cool pepsi machine lets you pick your own soda could have been wiped down. But busy so I understand. Few other observations was that the bumper cars only had a few cars operating they said were being fixed but would be up later. Manager in blue shirt was standing around just talking to other workers most of time we were there (2-1/2 hour) not to the guests looked very sloppy, unshaven and disengaged,  (other than with the other staff.) Why be there at all? But the $23 unlimited pass was a great deal and pizza keeps getting better. You guys should get a delivery driver for your pizza. Or a customer appreciation card for repeat guests. If you have one let me know, I am there!!!!"}
{"text":"No Beer! That sucks having some pizza without a nice cold adult beverage! Nice layout of bowling and games though! Will not go back."}
{"text":"Came here for a company-sponsored \"family night.\" Those are always fun because you get to find out unfortunate things like whose current spouse/significant other can actually crack mirrors or turn one to stone with their gaze. Maybe I just had too many drink tickets cashed in. Or maybe I just had to have all those drinks to try and erase my memory so I could actually sleep at night. Played a few arcade games and then tried some of what was supposed to pass for food. I've had better pizza at Chuck E. Cheese's. And no, that was not a compliment to YOU, Chuck - you rat bastard! To think I drove out to BFE for this. Basically a Dave & Busters with more bowling. And laser tag. Probably a lot more fun if I had ankle biters in tow. Or if I was one. I was trying to become just like one again but couldn't drink fast enough. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Note: KK, Shelby, & London's rating and review.  KK: this is so awesome!  Shelby: I love this place soon much  London: bouncing up and down from excitement    With that said, the food could be a little better. Would love a full bar for me. But that aside there is really a lot of awesome things to do here. Nice pool tables. Many lanes for bowling. Lazer tag. Two story jungle gym. Bumper cars. Arcades. Nearly a condensed Disneyland. Come to think of it i believe we attended a Radio Disney event here. Staff are all super sweet to the kids.   Keep it up folks!"}
{"text":"We attended our cousin's 5 Year Old's Birthday party this past weekend.  I had taken my 4 year old there twice in the past and had a great time!  According to my son, this was the best birthday party he had ever been too.  Lucky for us, the hosts bought the unlimited package.  The kids were able to go on all the attractions (Laser Tag, Laser Maze, Play Area, Bumper Cars and Mini Bowling) as many times as they could for 3 hours.  These kids didn't stop, other than to enjoy the great pizza and cookies.  The Party Host (sorry I don't remember her name) was so friendly and had fun interacting with the kids.    From my perspective the first two times we went, Flip Side was safe, clean and definitely worth a little extra money for all the things the kids could do.  We weren't going to miss a b-day party there.  I am adding it to my Summer Places to entertain my 4 year old!"}
{"text":"Went over tonight for some bowling and arcade with my older brother, we are both over 18, and it was a very fun experience with a very nice set of staff. I mostly enjoyed the fact that it felt that this place is perfect for people of all ages, and I hope to be back when they are busier to try out their laser tag games!"}
{"text":"This place is very nice for kids play and food, specially, good for some events like birthdays for your children with friends. It has a lot games for kids playable with a lot of funs! I highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"For being extremely expensive, ($21/each for 4 hrs) I expected nothing but the best. It was pretty big. They have two Bowling options, covered under various packages one is the full bowling one is mini bowling which is nice. They have a typical slew of arcade games, but none of those are included in any of their packages they range about 75 cents apiece except pool is 2.50 which is a lot. The bumper cars are pretty good it's probably one of their best features..  they called blast pads  I think. They have a small laser tag area. One of my favorite arcade type of games is air hockey and I was disappointed to find out they have old air hockey tables that don't work very well. I can't tell if it's the table or the pucks or a mixture of both I think it's mostly just old crappy tables. For the same amount of money in good weather I would definitely rather Castles and Coasters. The atmosphere is ok it is definitely filled with very small children even though it's pretty entertaining for children I would say up to low teens max. Mostly soccer mom's and bratty 5-7 yr olds.  If you want a true amusement park experience with a more general diverse crowd , lots of better ride I would definitely do castles and coasters. The location is kind of out in the middle of nowhere in far southeast Gilbert..  I ordered an $11 burger and the amount of fries that I got with it was about the size of the McDonalds small fries not kidding. See photo..  To make a long story short its not worth it to pay $21 a person just to have access to a tiny laser tag area, a few bumper cars and basically one other tiny thing. Everything else cost extra after your in"}
{"text":"Too much space has been left out for bowling which makes the arcade area crowded. The 3 hour deal is kinda expensive. It should be a little cheaper. The laser tag and Laser maze is nicer than some other places. We had an issue with availability of one of the attractions and owner was really grumpy to give us a $5 credit for it! Not sure if we are going back.  Update on 5/27. Ended up going back due to a b'day. The cafe staff was pretty rude. It seems like the customer is always wrong here. Downgrading the rating from 2 star to 1 !!"}
{"text":"We booked a birthday celebration for my son 11 years old. I got the big room but I was disappointed and that no one came to greet us as soon as we walked in. The  waitresses or whatever do you want to call them didn't sing happy birthday, the service was very distant I wasn't happy but the kids enjoy the games and the activities"}
{"text":"I recently held my son's 6th birthday party at Flipside. It was a really great experience overall, I chose to drop off the decorations myself and they did a good job setting up, food was good and brought out in a timely manner. I had two hosts, Amanda and Paige and they were wonderful, extremely helpful and very timely. They took over when the cake should be done and cutting it and passing it out and did all of the cleanup. Not to mention the kids had a blast after in the arcade with $10 on each of their cards and ability to do 3 of the attractions (crash pods, laser tag, laser maze, etc). Was definitely worth the price and stress free for me."}
{"text":"All I have too say is wow.  I love coming to this place the staff is friendly and so is the owner.  He saw me with my niece and offered her a scoop of ice cream what an awesome atmosphere here,  the bowling lanes are state of the art what a great place to being the family and hang out.  Food is awesome as well.  WAY TO GO FLIPSIDE."}
{"text":"The arcade is pretty small with mostly ticket games and high cost arcade machines. The place is fun with a good ambiance overall and a great bowling alley."}
{"text":"Always a fan of these kind of places that have fun for the whole family. There is an indoor playground, laser tag, kids bowling, and arcade games for the kids and bowling, beer, and pool tables for the adults. Food here isn't bad either nachos were huge and pizza is well pizza you would expect from this kinda of place. Overall not a bad place to waste a day at during the weekend on a hot day. Prices were pretty typical as well 60 bucks will get you an unlimited pass with bowling and 5 bucks of arcade play."}
{"text":"We went here just to go bowling on New Years eve. The couches they have for bowlers to sit on are nice, and give you more of a feeling of privacy when you bowl. The music, however, is so loud you can barely hear yourself think, and the giant TV's behind the bowling lanes are a little distracting. I think I would have given it 4 or 5 stars though if the music had not been so loud."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I'm not sure it will be my last, but I wouldn't go our of my way to come back. Overall I think if you have young kids its a good place to let them run around and burn off some energy however for the price I'm not sure its worth it. I don't know what package I purchased but it seemed like it was the best deal they had. $23 a person for unlimited use of the attractions and bowling. Since the bowling was $17 and they were including $5 worth of arcade game credit it seemed like the best deal. We were told that there was about a 30-45 minute wait for bowling so I put my name on the list and gave them my number I assume to call me when the lane was ready. So off we went to play games and use the attractions. I must say there is not a wide selection of games so that was a bit disappointing. The bumper pods were fun enough. So after spending about an hour and a half waiting for our lane I went back to the front to check on the status of our lane. I was told that we weren't on the list for bowling but they had a lane open if I wanted it. I told them I wanted the lane and the girl behind the counter told me it was going to be an additional $17 per person for bowling. Imagine my surprise when I was asker to pay again for something i already paid for. After we got that squared away, we enjoyed our time bowling.  All in all it wasn't a great experience, but it wasn't bad either. I feel it truly warrants the 3 star rating. Its average at best."}
{"text":"So we had my son's birthday party there and have taken him to 3-4 other parties there over the past 2 years.  Service:  Mostly high school kids with poor training and mostly marginal interest in customer service.  Can't say I've ever been impressed.  You'll run into a nice kid here and there, but most show little interest in customer satisfaction and it shows.  Attractions:  Laser tag is by far the best feature here unless you're a bowler.  The laser maze is also fun but the throughput of kids is just way too slow for a group of any size to enjoy it much.  The arcade has some decent games but expect that the kids will run through about $15-$20/hour (each) on arcade games in there.  Bowling is good and they have kids bowling which is also cool for the little ones that want to try it.  The nerf ball room/maze/fort is also great for having the kids pass the time after they blow their arcade credits.  Food:  Very meh to poor.  Pizza is only one notch above Peter Piper, and they burnt one of ours beyond recognition (now of course we returned it and they replaced it... but I can't believe they actually tried to give it to us in that condition).  Wicked expensive.  Pizza is passable for most kids from 4-11 (they know their demographic), but the parents will really be irritated they can't bring food in.    Price:  You can escape a function there for a slightly-more-than-reasonable price if you really do your homework and understand what you're really after and dig into their packages and plan things tightly.  If you just expect to go in, buy some passes, hang for a few hours and have everyone leave feeling satisfied, plan on spending A LOT (like $500 for a typical birthday party).  I'm not sure this is substantially different than other similar places, but I'll just say if we're going to drop that kind of coin, I'd be more inclined to fly to LA and go to Six Flags for a day... we can get three there, in a hotel, and through Six Flags for less than that.  Tip:  If yo're willing to plan, strongly recommend the all-access passes... if you plan out properly, don't have too big of a group or break the larger group into a few smaller ones with an adult with each and keep all the kids together, you can squeeze in about $80-$90 (at regular prices) of stuff for about 1/3 of that.  If you don't plan and just let them go nuts, you'll find about 2 of them will get good value, a few will do OK, and the rest will be unhappy because somebody else did laser tag 10 times and they only did it twice.  Net:  If you're in a pinch and can't come up with something better for a birthday or similar function for a kid 4 - 11, it's a fair possibility.  Just expect to either spend a good chunk of time digging into the options and planning or plan on spending ~$50/kid when it's all done.  If you do one of those, the kids will leave feeling good and saying they had a great time... you'll just feel like you left and got kicked in the wallet.  I'm on the fence between 2 and 3 stars, but I just feel like the effort isn't there on the ownership's part to warrant 3.  There are too many things that could be fixed by minimally better supervision and training of the employees.  With the value for the service, 3 would be as high as I'd ever go for this place unless they really improved their food quality and made the average cost/child more reasonable. I just really struggle with the value proposition here."}
{"text":"This place was incredibly disappointing. We were in on a Friday night around 6. It seemed like a ghost town. We ordered food at the counter and then had a seat. I guess they expect you to play games first because it was almost 45 minutes before our food arrived. I bought 40.00 in game cards and approx 10 games were out of order. 90.00 and some cheap redemption toys later we headed home. It is a very gorgeous building though. Also make sure your kids have socks and shoes and not flip flops on or they are not allowed to do laser tag or laser maze."}
{"text":"I have been here several times with my 8 year old son and his friends. I think its a great place to take kids and its very comfortable for adults, especially because they have Wifi connection and I usually take my laptop and sign on to it while keeping an eye on the kids. They also have a decent food area that includes things other than just pizza ! I really love this place , the only down side to it is I think the prices are way too high , especially the prices on the games.. Its easy to spend more than 100 dollars on 2 kids playing there for a few hours ( with OUT ) food.. so be prepared to have a nice time, but you are going to pay a high price for it ! :-)"}
{"text":"My kid loves this place.  We went to party here before and she really digs it.  So we are trying to book a birthday party and all of my contact information is on the request.  We get everything lined out, I tell the associate to call me for the deposit, put my personal phone down and get back to work.  Never hear from her.  She didn't call.  She responded to the e-mail that she was there all day and to give her a call.  I got busy, didn't find this for weeks.  Finally make an effort to re-connect - no call back, no e-mail back, no anything for almost a full week ... I desperately wanted this to work for my daughter, but I'm getting a really bad vibe already.  I don't like chasing people ... so until I get the attention I deserve, I'm not changing my rating."}
{"text":"The kiddos had a blast!  The adults did too...  First of all, this is new and clean, which makes it such a nice place to let the kids run around freely.  For $15.99 each kiddo got to use all five activities:  Laser Tag, Laser Maze, Playground Structure, Mini Bowling and Bumper Cars.  There is an unlimited activities package for around $25 per person, but you have to use it within 3 hours.  It was nice to take our time with the five choices having little ones.  I can see older kids go from one place to another nonstop, it would be worth it.  The regular bowling was extra (not included in the package), all of us adults and children played.    For the Laser Tag, you need  closed toe shoes.  They let you borrow bowling shoes if you happen to be like me who live on slippahs most of the year.  Don't forget to bring socks...ay-ayay-ay...I had to buy mine and my Aunt's for $2 a pair.  That was worth it rather than driving in the heat to Target to purchase a pack.  Since we had a big group, they let us by ourselves divided into two.  My little cutie pie (the blue team) and my nephew (the red team) were our captains.  The red team went in first.  Since my sister had been there before, they all went up to the second story...we were ambushed!  It was so much fun and much less painful than paintball.    The cafe suprisingly had pretty good food!  They served us all a huge pitcher of iced water...refreshing.  We also ordered chicken/bacon pizza and giant nachos while we were bowling.  I can't say enough how good the service was from everyone who worked there that day.  Keep that up please!    The kiddos wanted to play some more, so while the adults waited we decided to order some milkshake.  They were so yummy that came in a big portion, one tall glass was enough to divide into two or three....then we had to share with the kiddos when they saw what we had ordered.   We'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"First time at Flipside. Found the Employees polite and helpful. It was clean and well presented. Just experienced the bowling and the well stocked bar. All in all a good place for family entertainment."}
{"text":"I would call this place Flip FLOP if your brown I suggest not wasting your time. It took over 20 minutes just to get waters. We had to go to the main desk and speak to a manager just to get the water and when the mangers were asked who we should complain to they didn't know if they were the right people."}
{"text":"A fun place for a team builder bowling pool food beer. Also great for a family outings birthdays party's or just a night out they have video games food ect.. Clean, great for all ages"}
{"text":"Great place for a birthday party. We have been to several and my 7 year old had his here. The kids loved the play area and arcade. The also have bowling. Lots of fun. Would recommend for a party!"}
{"text":"What a great place!  While visiting Phoenix for a week in Dec we spent several hours at this family fun center.  We two adults played arcade games, bowled a couple games, and relaxed with a book in a quiet area.  Haven't had this much fun in years!   Looks impressive inside, helpful employees, and overall a fabulous experience."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, both times for meetings related to business.   I love the ambiance, and the environment is great.   The clean, sleek and modern styles here create an atmosphere that really makes you want to show up here again and again.   There was definitely some thought placed into the architecture, and you can tell that they didn't cut corners.  Overall, both times were an excellent experience, and I believe they deserve Five stars!"}
{"text":"Good drinks nice clean atmosphere but I have to say scattered ass everywhere sad thing is it's young teenagers with shorts that don't cover anything and groups of girls shaking their ass when u have children and families trying to have a good time where they spend their hard working money. Sadly there should be a dress code to the point where its respectful for the person and others... Sad to say their parents don't know they dress like this... But for the most part it's decent"}
{"text":"We bought 2 passes for unlimited bowling today. I was told that the only reason it wouldn't be unlimited was if they were on a wait and they would ask us to bowl in 1 hour increments. 1 hour later, we were into the 4th frame of or 3rd hour, with plenty of lanes open, and our game shut off and the screen  told us to contact the control desk. I go up to the desk, and hear them assigning our lane to another group. When I asked about this, the guy told us that they didn't know we were on the lane and they would add time, but I told them it was pointless because they just assigned a new group to our lane. The offered us no explanation other than our lane was shut off completely because they didn't know we were there, and they obviously were not on a wait (2 lanes next to us were empty).   On top of that, we had to ask for a server because no one came to our lane after us being there for 20 minutes. saw multiple employees congregating instead of coming over to serve us. Not worth the price if they are just going to shut the lane off on you in the middle of a game with no timer warning."}
{"text":"Every time a new place opens up in the valley that provides summer fun for kids, we try it. And then we end up coming back here. Its clean and the layout accommodates and separates the ages for the most part. No adults spilling beer on your kids head in the playroom. No kids listening to the banter of teens etc."}
{"text":"This place could be really cool but the employees are lacking education about the establishment! Which means the Management IS NOT doing their job. I actually had to complain to a Manager when I found a price sheet after I had been there for 4 hrs. For the money I spent I could of done the Unlimited package but the Cashier never presented it to me at the discounted rate that I qualified for. The Manager did not seem sincerely apologetic...when I actually corrected him about what each package offered he said \"Oh they changed it\".....Shouldn't he be the first to know and also educate his Employees? When a Customer finds out they could of got quite a bit more for about $1.50 more a kid I believe a Manager should be more attentive to that fail on their part. Inspite of all the Employees being asleep on the job the kids had a BLAST and The Manager did give me a free pizza for my trouble which was really quite nice. So, I will go back for my kids and hopefully they iron out these kinks. I personally think the packages seem a bit pricey so when you want to charge these rates you need to have quality service in which to back it up! We had the Nachos and a Large pizza and they were both pretty good. Another thing when I went up to order the Pizza I asked if there was any package with soda for a group of kids. He said \"no\" the soda's are $2.50 so with the amount of kids I had I was looking at spending $21 in soda...so I walked away for a minute to grab my purse and when I came back to order I was looking at the cups and I see the kids cups and I asked the price of those and he said $1.25. Why he did not find this valuable info when I was up there 1 minute prior I will never know??? So, I would like to give this only 2 stars but like I said the Kiddos had a BLAST! So 3 stars it is!"}
{"text":"It probably makes most sense to come here with kids, but when invited to a 2 year old's birthday party, this is a great environment for adults as well! This is a fun-in-one stop. They have a full arcade, foam pits, bumper cars, air hockey, bowling, laser tag and more. You purchase a card and put points on the card. With a swipe of a card, your all set to play!   This game center is focused on families and they don't serve alcohal, but it's still a good time for adults! The games vary in level and everything is adult-friendly and of course kid-friendly! We came here for a two year old's birthday party but found a way to have fun ourselves. They have private rooms you can rent for a party and they also have a full cafe that serves plenty of food and sodas.   If I lived closer and had kids, I would definitely frequent this place. I hope they add more of these in the Valley!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty neat place for people of all ages. Customer service was good. Bowling is awesome there because of the couches and great lanes. However if you are bowling with little ones you will have to ask the front desk for a light weight ball (a bit inconvenient). Would go again with friends/family."}
{"text":"Worst service and food (even by bowling alley standards)!!! We visited tonight with a group of 10 to bowl, have some drinks and munch on appetizers. We had finished our first full game before our server finally brought us pitcher of water(we had to track him down 3 times to repeatedly ask), waited over an hour for our appetizers, however, our beer came out within a mere 40 minutes... Won't ever be going back! It's such a shame, we had high hopes for this place since there's really nothing like it on this side of town. :-("}
{"text":"So much fun! Love the laser tag! Laser maze is so much fun! We will defiantly be back! Recommend 3 hr pass"}
{"text":"My youngest daughter went here for her end of the year field trip and she came home ranting and raving about how much fun she had and that she wanted to go back over Summer Break. We finally got around to going and making it a family fun night.     We hit up the arcade first and my youngest went straight to the caged in jungle gym that they have in the middle of the arcade. My youngest loves that play place and spent most our visit in there. The arcade although on the smaller side is still enough to keep the kids and adults happy. After about an hour in the arcade we headed over to get dinner.     The dining area was clean and comfortable. Our food took a little while to come out but the big screen TVs kept everyone happy. Also, while we waited my husband found an employee and asked some questions about the mini-bowling. We had our dinner and then headed over to mini-bowling.     The mini-bowling was a little bit confusing and we ended up taking up two lanes temporarily and then we were able to figure it out and only use one lane of the bowling. The mini-bowling was fun and both the kids loved it. After the mini-bowling we went back to the arcade. The kids went on the bumper cars and my youngest went back up to the play place. All in all we had a really good time."}
{"text":"If you're tired and disgusted by of all the usual dirty, out dated and worn family fun centers then head to Flipside.   I just took my 6 year old daughter for father's day and we had an amazing time.  The inside was modern, spacious and inviting. All of the employees were very friendly and helpful. Between the bowling, mini bowling, pool tables, arcade, bumper cars, blast pad, and lazer tag there's something for everyone. Bowling at night was pretty cosmic with all the neon and black lighting. They have auto bumpers for children that automatically go up when your children bowl and go back down when the adults bowl, though I did see some adults using them. The bumper cars were really fun, even my very small daughter was able to drive one herself. The bumpers on the cars themselves are very soft so you don't get the jarring whiplash feeling.   I was hesitant about getting food at a place like this from past experiences. Luckily my little one was hungry and I caved in to her request. Thankfully the food turned out to be great. My daughter had a kid's meal and I chose a double cheese burger which turned out to be huge. I was expecting two thin patties but they turned out to be thick and pretty juicy. Certainly an added plus is that they'll bring your order directly to your bowling lane.   I felt the prices were not bad considering the attractions, cleanliness, and the package deals, like the 23 dollar unlimited attractions, which helps. Each person receives a card, like a hotel key card, that you preload and swipe for the attractions, and arcade. No more cramming tickets into your pockets as the card automatically keeps track of your tickets. You'll have to preload the card to play the arcade games. They were a little on the high side, but the games weren't out dated either.   We will undoubtedly be back."}
{"text":"Had the brunch and bowl combo today....  I would not recommend the food quality. In fact- I did not eat my food. The main reason why the low score is the way they treated my 4 year old nephew. We played some games and were checking out with the tickets. The lady handed me the whoopie cushion, I showed it to my nephew and he said he didn't want it. I looked at the lady and said I'd like something else. She told me no- that she had closed out the ticket already. Are you kidding me?!? It had been 30 seconds! I was literally still standing there looking at her and I couldn't change it for something else??? Now I have an upset 4 year old. I asked her if I could then buy something instead and she said no! I couldn't believe it. I mean come on if you're dealing with children you really need to be more accommodating.   Also- after speaking to my sister I have found out that there have been similar issues with the level of service and wait times they have experienced. Looks like we may need to be looking for a different place to go next time."}
{"text":"We came here for my son and couple of his friends to hangout for his Bday, he enjoyed it a lot. For $23 the whole day of bowling, laser tag, mini bowling, bumper cars, blast pad area and of course arcade which is separate for the $23. It is worth the price,  especially for keeping them busy for the whole day. We are about to order pizza and some nachos with a side of basket fries, I heard the food here is pretty good.   Just received the food, much better than some of establishments I've been too like this!! Check out the pics!"}
{"text":"We are visiting AZ for possibly moving here in the future. We showed up to be disappointed. The laser tag and bowling didn't open till 3pm. We decided to play arcade in the mean time. There was about 5 games that took our money and no game. We only complained about one. We had to ask for someone at the prize counter and in the middle of our transaction the manager came over and took the lady who was taking care of us to go over to the laser maze and help other people. We stood at the counter for 10 min before the manager walked by and I said \"hey that was extremely rude for her to be helping us and then run off to help the next people in line, w/out saying anything. He apologized, but at that point we were already over it."}
{"text":"Fun for kids and very friendly staff. Would be five stars if eveyrhing  had been working (mini bowl, crash pods)."}
{"text":"Great Time--Beyond my expectations! Thanks so much Pam for your help in planning our 50th anniversary event on Saturday June 27 at FlipSide. The event turned out to be great! Everyone was very well pleased with the food and all the activities. We were warmly greeted at the front door and taken to our lanes. Our host was very friendly and did an outstanding job and was always available to help us whenever needed. Our \"thanks\" to the chef for the wonderful presentation of the food. Please pass the word on that we really enjoyed having some of the employees come by to say congratulations on our 50th and let the ones who were helping out with the event know that they did an excellent job! Again, we appreciate all your time and knowledge that you put into making this a successful party! Donna N. Mesa, Arizona"}
{"text":"We went here recently, the last time it actually rained in Arizona.  We arrived right when they opened, so it was not crowded at all for the first few hours.  The bowling area is very clean and has a good atmosphere.  After we finished bowling we went to the arcade section where they have a pretty cool laser \"mission impossible\" type game room where you are timed and have to avoid lasers in the dark.    It was a fun place to go.  Even better if you are able to find a coupon or groupon.  But I would definitely recommend arriving right at opening time in order to have a better experience."}
{"text":"Bowling alleys are nice. Diverse activities-something for everyone of every age.  Clean, staff available, looks like a great place for birthdays too.  Food smelled good although I didn't get anything. Dining area was clean, alleys clean and modern."}
{"text":"Arcade was good, that's where it stops, after 9pm the employees start giving hints that they want you to leave, we overtipped on 2 drinks, she said thanks then just blantly ignored us when we wanted one more drink for our bowling games. Then the fact you pay per hour, if you play with a large group you're already up to a hour to play all 10 rounds. Would only recommend for the arcade, not the people or bowling."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure whether to give 2 or 3 stars. Maybe it was me. Maybe I came in with a higher expectation. The employees are young, so I'll give them that. But no one seems to be very helpful or know what they're doing. Just expensive for what you get. You kind of stand around waiting for someone to help you."}
{"text":"Took my whole family to this place on New Years for a fun day out. I was VERY impressed by how technologically advanced the bowling was...it definitely made for a better experience. In the bowling lanes, you can actually pick a theme for your lane screen, as well as add up to 7 players. You can also set each person's profile to have bumpers on/off and to temporarily skip a person if they leave for a few minutes. The whole building was very clean, even the restrooms. I loved the whole experience and really appreciate how the management refunded me $1 on my game card when I accidentally swiped it twice. BONUS - they offer free refills for as long as you are there!"}
{"text":"We booked our sons 5th birthday party here. Overall, the booking process was very easy from start to finish.  Flipside called a couple days before the party to confirm the number of people and amount of food needed. Everything was perfect and ready when we arrived the night of the party. The kids had a blast and many of the other parents who had never been to Flipside before were really impressed with how nice it was for a party.  I will definitely be going back to Flipside for birthday parties in the future.  As a side note, I have been to Flipside several other times just to hang out with my little boy just for something to do in the evenings. The finishes inside are very nice and the staff does a great job keeping the place clean and safe . The food is really good and there is a little something to do for each age group."}
{"text":"We visited FlipSide for the first time today. Overall, we were very impressed with the facility. It's clean, modern, technologically-advanced, and family-friendly. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because of some of the staff. The guest services staff was great, very attentive, and was eager to answer our questions. The staff in the arcade area (bumper cars, blast pad) came off as bored or could care less to be there. It's almost as if they are being forced to work there...no smiles, not friendly in the least and its these people who are out there with our kids, helping to swipe their cards, etc. I get it, working with kids can be challenging at times, especially when it is busy but we were there at 11a on Sunday and it was not busy at all. So, I think the place could use some adjustments in the staffing/personnel area of the business but other than that, the place knocks it out of the park. Prices are reasonable, gaming and activities are excellent (mini-bowling is just PERFECT for your 4/5 year old), I think this is a great addition to Gilbert!"}
{"text":"I took my 11year old to Flipside with a group of friends for his birthday. They had a blast and I intend to let them go more often. It is great family fun. The place is sometimes understaffed and so don't expect to be able to get food quickly.  But the staff does their best and it is still a nice activity."}
{"text":"I went with a group of 10 people on a Sunday morning where they had Unlimited bowling for 3 hours and Buffet breakfast.  The bowling went fine, but the service for food and drinks was absolutely terrible.  After about 30 minutes from ordering our food, our breakfast plates came out with the exception of 1 person in our group, his food plate took an extra 30 minutes to make.  We all had the same breakfast plate and couldn't understand what was taking so long for the last person in our group to be served his breakfast.  We asked the manager and the server several times where the last breakfast plate is and there response was; \"it's coming out shortly\".  no apology.   The bowling was ok.  The price for 3 hours of unlimited bowling was a good deal, but again, the service was absolutely terrible and the food was not that great either.  Fast food from McDonald's would have been better, even from the dollar menu."}
{"text":"This place doesn't seem as busy as before.  The food here has always been pretty good but pricey.  The arcade doesn't seem like it has been kept up cause most of the games are either broken or not working.  We went here for my daughters bday so we purchased the food, bowling, and games package.  Again, I think the package is a little higher than average but the kids had fun and I guess that is all that matters when you come to these types of locations."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome place! 4 stars for \"attractions\" they have a pretty decent arcade, laser tag, laser maze, jungle gym, bumper cars, mini bowling, bowling and pool tables. 3 stars for food, it isn't awful, but its also not great. They have a decent menu but think along bowling alley food/small bar taste. 3 star on price unfortunately, if you don't come on a night they have a special running or you come on the weekends, prepare yourself for spending an arm and a leg and waiting in longer lines for the attractions. I came here last night with my son and a few of his friends for his bday. I think I ended up spending about $125 by the end of the night. This included attraction cards for each kid, arcade cards, food and drinks, we stayed about 3 hours. Office staff was nice, helpful and the place was clean and safe. If you can come on a weekday night and try avoiding weekends its less hectic (think of amazing jakes/peter piper as one and 3 times as busy)"}
{"text":"Expensive at first but well worth it. Nice place to come and relax while the kids play. Food is alright not the best but good enough."}
{"text":"My first time here. Lots of loud music and flashing lights. Saw lots of employees wandering around and standing. But after I stood at the bar for 5 minutes, and no one came to take my order, I left."}
{"text":"Absolute waste of money. Bad service but most importantly way over priced. Don't bring your kids unless you plan on spending $500 or more. Take them to the park instead."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place to take the kids to have fun. The employees were very nice all the games were functioning my only complaint would be the restroom soap dispensers not working."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Flipside and it was fantastic. My family and I had so much fun. The manager Brad was helpful and even recommended the sliders to eat (which were amazing)!!!! We will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Be aware the $99 summer pass is only good M-F. When my husband bought it he was told it was good all summer. We both work full time so we would have never purchased it knowing it cannot be used on weekends."}
{"text":"We very much enjoyed our time there with our kids last weekend.  Pretty good food and the attractions are clean and work well.  Just a couple issues: when the facility opened up, the Crash Pods were charging, so we couldn't use them for about 20 minutes.  It wouldn't matter much, except that we paid for a 3 hr. pass, so time is money!  The other issue was they ran out of certain menu items--this surprises me for a Saturday--I would think they would be fully ready for the full-on weekend crowd.  BUT, don't let these little things stop you from coming--it's a very fun place for kids and adults--will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very cool place! The only thing that I consider it's important for the owners to work on is on hygiene, since it's a play place for mostly the young and kids, it should be periodically schedule a good clean, the toddler area is pretty dusty, the carpet looks like is not vacuumed daily and the machines are as well very dusty, windows not cleaned. I consider this crucial. I also agree with the lady that post a picture of the very dark area for toddler, is not inviting for them , should be brighter. It's pretty cool apart from that, but it really makes me think twice in coming back"}
{"text":"Updated review: After a couple months' experience with this bowling center I felt the need to upgrade this review.  Staff: Friendly, helpful, competent.  There are a few younger staff members who could use some \"mentoring\" but for the most part everyone seems to be on their game.  A special commendation for Ben, the league coordinator, who very diplomatically, helped resolve a scoring situation with our team that resulted in our team losing a large number of points.  Turns out there was a mistake when they entered my average at the beginning of the league.  None of us were happy.  Ben explained and re-explained the situation several times until we all understood.  He apologized for the mistake and handled the situation with a lot more tact than someone his age normally has.  Lanes/facilities: When I wrote my first review, it was because I had a bad experience.  The air conditioning was broken, it was hot in the bowling center, the lane oil and overall lane quality was poor and as a result, my scores were low.  This has since improved.  No complaints about the lanes.  Food: Best bowling alley food I've ever had.  I mean, *really* good food.  There is nothing on the menu that isn't delicious.  Prices:  Very reasonable.  Lowest prices of any bowling center in the valley, that includes AMF and Brunswick, whose prices have gotten ridiculous.  Considering the overall quality of the experience, Flipside is a great value.  Overall: A very nice, family oriented bowling center.  Why not five stars?  The bar currently only serves beer and wine.  When they start serving liquor, I'll upgrade my review."}
{"text":"I will start off by saying that Esther should not be hired to be the friendly, smiling girl that greets you at the counter because she is far from that!!  She was very rude and unhelpful!! She acted as if she hated her job and had better places to be!!  After she rudely told us that there were no specials at the time we paid for our bowling (reasonable price).  We went back to our lane and went to pick out our bowling balls.  Come to find out the bowling balls for little kids (5 and 7 year old) were kept behind the counter which would have been nice of Esther to share that information.  One of the other employees apologized that we had not been informed of that and went to grab my sons a bowling ball.  We asked to order a butter pecan milkshake and they were out of that flavor, so the young man went back to see what flavors they did have.  He came back and rattled off a few ice-cream names.  We asked what one of the flavors with a weird name was and he said he had no clue!! Well don't you think you should find that out when you are going to see what flavors are available for a customer?! Needless to say we skipped the milkshake.  Lack of service but The bowling was great!! The lanes were nice and we had a great time with family!!"}
{"text":"MY family went here last month because we wanna get some info for a party for Nov. 11 which is a Tuesday the Manager says no need to book a party coz the deal that they have every Tuesday is better it`s $17.99 for unlimited bowl shoe rental included, laser tag bumper car , the only thing that`s not included is the arcade section. So we said ok. Give out invitations and it just happened that one of our friend wanna get some info for the café that they have and asked about their specials every Tuesday and get to find out FLIPSIDE management change everything including the Tuesday deal that they have so now we have to change the plan and go to amazing jakes instead. Well its their loss."}
{"text":"This is a decent spot for family fun. It can get pricey but I know they changed around some pricing to create more packages which is great. The food is more gourmet style and that can be pricey as well but overall the experience is worth it"}
{"text":"This place is very unique and fun. Every bowling lane feels like you are in your own private bowling alley with two flat screen TV's playing music videos and sports as you bowl! They have a fun but small game room and jungle gym for kids as well. And a small concession stand and there also is table service. Games and food over priced and food is not good quality."}
{"text":"Flipside is one of my sons favorite places. He is 12 and can spend hours there without getting bored. We chose the 3 hour unlimited pass for 21 dollars which includes everything except normal bowling. He mainly plays laser tag though lol. I like that I can sit in the lounge area and have a pretty good view of the whole place. We have only tasted the appetizers from the cafe and they were underwhelming. I cannot speak of the other food as we did not eat any. It can get expensive if you have more than 1 child but alas I have only 1 to spoil. Great place to cool off in the summer."}
{"text":"Food is GREAT.  I've had dinner here a number of times prior to league, never the same thing twice.  Price is decent and the food has ALWAYS been good.  The league issues are another story.  This center has a state of the art lane machine and is able to put down any pattern possible.  I have absolutely NO complaints on the lane conditions, I just suck.  Some weeks more than others, but that is another story.  There is NEVER an announcement prior to league that we are starting practice.  I dont think I have EVER been in a league where there is not some kind of announcement prior to league.  If nothing else, most centers will try to 'upsell' happy hour pitchers of beer (or whatever they want to put on special) before the start of league.  In additon league doesnt start on time.  It is USUALLY 5+ minutes late.  One week we were 15 minutes later than scheduled.  I am not sure if the desk people are unable to tell time or too busy talking to each other.  There are ALWAYS 3+ ppl at the front desk.  I dont understand how it can be THAT tough.    As another poster said, the approaches are tacky.  Again, not the worst thing that can happen.  And generally speaking I don't have too many complaints about approaches.  Some weeks they are 'worse' than others.  Not exactly sure what is going on.  After all the approaches (like the lanes) are synthetic.    But the lane machines are another story.  There have been continous problems with pin setters dropping pins, not placing pins, etc.  The machines, at times, act like they are 20+ years old.  Which is kind of weird since they are NEW!    Flipside is probably one of the most 'over-staffed' places I have ever seen in my life.  There are at LEAST 25 'blue shirt' clones running around trying to take food/drink orders from people.  I think it would be a better place if they got rid of a half dozen 'blue shirts' and got a REAL mechanic for the machines.  If you are a SERIOUS league bowler, this may not be the place for you.  At least not right now.  Flipside needs to get a lot of 'kinks' out of their system, assuming there is one.  I dont think management has ever run a bowling center or they would know these 'rudimentary' things."}
{"text":"Updated indoors play area for the kiddies. It's average pricing compared to others that are similar. Lazer tag was fun, even for us oldies ;). The reason I'm giving it 3 stars, is it's kind of set up for the parents to sit back and kick it while the kids run amuck. Granted, helicopter parenting isn't ideal, but if your child is a POS like most of them there were, then you need to be there to put them back in line. Being that this was a new environment for us, we did follow our son everywhere, and we were so disappointed in the lack of parenting in there. Kids trying to steal my sons ticket on games, pushing and shoving to get in line, just blatant disrespect for people around them. We ended up leaving cause it was too much for me and my husband to handle."}
{"text":"Do NOT eat at their restaurant if you have kids that are hungry or anyone that is \"hangry\" in your party. We ordered our food and it took almost an hour to get our food and the appetizer came out last. They only had 1 cook in the back. This has happened multiple times at flipside... The food is good but not worth the wait."}
{"text":"My 10 year old boys had fun.  A little pricey but it is clean, well lit and not too loud.  For the adults....the wifi blows, the food is not very good and expensive.  A small iced latte was just under $5.  Can't bring anything in either....(and Pepsi products..ick).  All attractions/games were in good working condition."}
{"text":"Had a less than favorable experience at FlipSide this past weekend for Olivia's 7th birthday w/ her classmates.  We left feeling disappointed as did the other parents.  Reached out to FlipSide management and they did let us know that there were some unfortunate events that transpired this past Saturday to which they were not prepared for in turn throwing everything off.  What they DID do was make it right by issuing a refund as well as some passes to come back for an opportunity to experience it the way it should be.  Honestly - that's all we could ask for, to which most places these days would have just said, sucks to be you.  Thank you #FlipSide for making this right!  You have earned us back!"}
{"text":"It was okay.  The wings were good.  Our service was not very good.  She wasn't very organized, and didn't really take care of the party as well as other servers from other venues we've been.  She let the kids off without asking the parents if it was okay to let them play already! That was NOT okay!!"}
{"text":"A great place- I just wish they'd ask if it was your first time there. This is the type of place that if you choose some of the activities- you need to know what you're doing. I went for mini bowling and wasn't told exactly how it worked, the card they gave me was to be used to basically start the game. I kept looking around, i had no clue where mini bowling was, found it all the way in the back in a little room. Also the blast pad you are supposed to get a stamp when entering, except there was no employees around and when we were asked if we were stamped the employee had attitude as if we were supposed to already know."}
{"text":"This is a kids play place- on crack! They have the typical arcade games but they also have a HUGE playground, bumper cars, and laser tag. There is something for everyone here! This place is better than the typical arcade place and it has a wide variety of games for different ages! There are not only young kids here but some adults who were playing some games. It was also very clean and the staff was friendly. The prize counter... Wow. They had an array of prizes. I'm impressed."}
{"text":"I was tasked with planning a large company party, and FlipSide proved to be the perfect venue for our needs! Nicole is the official coordinator for Flipside and goes above and beyond to not only meet your needs, but anticipate them! Planning our holiday party was a dream, and having Nicole in constant communication was amazing. I highly recommend this venue and am so happy with the turnout of our holiday party! Everyone had a wonderful time! Thank you Nicole & Flipside staff!!!"}
{"text":"This place used to be fun. The staff is very rude and today the front desk girl had attitude about their unlimited attraction special that's on the front page of their website! She had no clue. This place is way overpriced and is not fun anymore. Everyone I know stopped going but we gave it another try today, spring break. The place was a ghost town. No more for us."}
{"text":"This past weekend was my first time at flip side and will be my last . Customer service was horrible. No one came to our lane to take our order. I tried to ask an employee walking by and her response was \"sorry I have to get back to front desk\"  So I proceeded to go to the snack bar my self and the cashier said \"well you can order here.\" My problem was that I had my kids with me and couldn't leave them to go order\"  so she said she would send someone over . Well no one came. So I asked another employee and he said \"we are busy today\". I had never had this experience at any other bowling place I have ever gone !"}
{"text":"We have been to this place several times. We have had bad experiences a couple of times. Tonight we tried to go. It is a holiday so we knew they would have adjusted hours. Their web site said it was open 10am-7pm today. We showed up before 6:00pm. The doors were locked and there was no sign saying it was closing early. Needless to say, the kids were very disappointed. We also noticed others trying to go in as well, surprised by the locked doors. We also had bad customer service the last time we went with a large group. Flipside could be a great venue, if it were run by folks interested in the customers."}
{"text":"I would give a 5 star for service for the staff that associated with us the night that we were there ONLY. I give a 2-3 star for prices. By the time you eat and do anything there with your family/kids, your bill is ENORMOUS. I would have paid less had I gone to Amazing jakes which is larger and has the all you can eat buffet. I give a 1 star for the sales manager Amy and her customer service skills (lack thereof) and for not helping in ANY way to keep the reputation of FlipSide and its staff...to be as flawless as it was the night that I visited with my children and their friends. And since she was my final impression, one start it is!"}
{"text":"Family fun (arcade, laser tag, bowling, mini bowling), snacks, meals, dessert, adult beverages. Can host private parties.  The 3 hr activity card is best deal, plus load arcade $ onto it. Adult bowling separate. Would return again."}
{"text":"I am not happy with the service at this facility. My granddaughter's birthday party was held on Sunday. When we arrived, the facility had no record of our event. They had cashed the deposit check so they quickly threw together a large, unoccupied  party room. Our party was for 10 children. They put a table cover on one table turned on some lights (not all) and left the other tables bare, (tacky). They had one person assigned to the party (I expected at minimum 2). The kids games were combined with another family that was there. As a result, they were not able to play all of the games together due to of lack of space. After hustling around to get the room, they informed us the pizza oven had been out of order for 2 days and there would be a delay in getting the pizza! Early into the party the teenage planner came in and offers a 10% discount. Yes you heard me, they did not have the party scheduled, they did not have enough space, they did not have the pizza, the list goes on and they offered a %10 discount!  I left after an hour and promised myself, I will give this rendition of the first hour of my granddaughter's birthday party to Yelp."}
{"text":"well we got her appetizers with our meal which why would I order appetizers if I wanted it with my main meal whole. Food really overpriced games are overpriced we did have a good time."}
{"text":"Very fun place!  they now have bowling leagues if that is your thing.  All the employees are awesome.  Brett in particular was very helpful :)   If you are looking for something to do, whether young or old, give this place a try.  Food and fun!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my trip to Flipside with my three kids. They loved the jungle gym (tunnels ect). I thought it was a clever design. There are tons of balls in there which you can shoot out of cannons or shove up tubes that lead to different things. Also a pretty fun slide. Kept my kids busy for quite a while! But beware there is no age limit. My 3 and 4 year old were playing in there with about 5 teenage boys. They should think about some kind of like \"teenager night\" or something. My 4 yr old got a burn on his arm from being pushed down the slide by one teen. There was an employee at the door who said nothing as he came out of the door crying. But no age limit means I went right in there as well!   Although I do agree with my fellow Yelpers that the staff needs to have some sort of \"put on a happy face,\" \"smile for the customers,\" or \"read the employee manual\" meeting. They seem tired, or maybe down right annoyed to be working there? The girl guarding the entrance to the play place didnt smile once. Maybe she hates her new job or maybe just lacks people skills.. I don't know? But she does absolutely no supervising of kids so I'm not sure why she was standing there. The food was pretty darn good though. I tried a burger with some kind of jalapeño sauce that was delish. And I'm glad that they have Pepsi.  The mini bowling is a genius idea and the arcade was fun as well. This place is super clean too!  I'm hoping that they are just getting all the kinks worked out from just opening. Overall.. I think I will give them another try And hope for the best."}
{"text":"My kids had a awesome time. I love the mini bowling! It's so cute and perfect for younger kids. It's a great place for kids my only complaint is that it's a little expensive.  We bought two 3hr unlimited attraction passes it was $53 then I had to buy 2 pairs of sock which are 2 bucks a pair. The passes do come with $5 loaded on them for the arcade games. That goes pretty quick and ended up adding an additional $15 bucks. So it's pretty pricey, but I would go back because the kids had a great time."}
