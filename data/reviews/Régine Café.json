{"text":"Régine Café est définitivement l'un des meilleurs endroits pour déjeuner. Oubliez les oeufs tournés et rôties sans intérêt, cet endroit a beaucoup mieux à offrir. Tout a l'air délicieusement appétissant et vous donne envie d'y retourner tous les matins. Je me promets d'essayer le Nutella maison lors de ma prochaine visite."}
{"text":"Have to say this is now one of my fave brunches! Too bad it's 7 hrs away! We started with bowl of mochaccini. The bowl is just huge, as big as a small rice bowl, with a marshmallow on top! How cool it that! We them ordered Champi and a French toast dish with egg and pulled ham. Both were tasty and huge portion as well! Even the presentation is top notch! I like that they put the fruits in a separate jar on the side.  It's hard to find a brunch place that serves hearty food but with a modern twist! I d highly recommend to all!  Only complaint is they ran out of donut holes! Look so delish! Order early!"}
{"text":"5 stars for fantastic food with justified prices and amazing service. They even made waiting outside a pleasure. Go there if you have the chance! It's worth it."}
{"text":"Endroit très original pour bruncher en groupe.  Je vous conseilles de réserver avant surtout les weekends.  Nourriture bonne en général.  Par contre, manque de saveur a certain moment. Et prix élevé pour mon budget moyen."}
{"text":"This breakfast place is awesome! Their menu is very diverse compared to most breakfast places and thats what makes it interesting. For anyone whos willing to try something different this is the place to go. When I went we were a group of 6 people and everyone loved their meal. I had the croissant with pulled ham and spinach sauce and I loved it. I also had the matcha latte which was fantastic as well.  Their cinnamon buns are crazzzyy good so that is a must have!!  We did wait in line for about 30 minutes on a Sunday at around noon which is not so bad and totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"J'adore j'adore!! Superbe petit resto brunch/déjeuner qui sort de l'ordinaire. Le décor est superbe, l'ambiance très agréable. Une belle carte bien travailler propose des plats délicieux pour les yeux autant que l'estomac. Des oeuvres d'art pour les papilles. Gauffres saumon fumé, grilled cheese avec fromage vieilli, pattisseries maison, crumpets.. Sans oublier un des meilleurs cafés au lait que j'ai bu! Les serveurs sont très attentif et acceuillant, ont se très bien dès l'entrer du café.  Petit bémol.. La fin de semaine il y a souvent ( toujours ) une file d'attente TRÈS longue.. J'y vais donc habituellement la semaine."}
{"text":"Insanely good - fancy food, swift and friendly French service, not-too-posh decor. Food (pork) not overly salt-saturated, and very fresh and fabulous plating. So worth the hour wait outside in -7 degree cold. Really!"}
{"text":"Saveurs inégales. Fade ou trop salé.   Il faudrait que j'y retourne la semaine juste pour vivre une expérience zen (trop de monde le weekend, on attend longtemps!)"}
{"text":"Really great brunch place but often has some waiting time to get a table. The menu has something for everyone and I've never been disappointed with what I ordered. Service is quick and friendly!"}
{"text":"So so so so so so good. Best breakfast of my life. I feel lucky to be living in the same city as this restaurant. For those who can't stand line-ups but love delicious food- bear it because it's worth it!! We got there at 10:00am on a Tuesday and there was about a 45 minute wait for a table. As I said, it's worth it!  I had the traditional breakfast because it had a little taste of everything including their delectable homemade pulled ham. Oh my my. I won't describe everything on the plate but trust me, every bite was fantastic and I have rarely come by this level of quality in food. I also tried the trout gravlax on a corn-bread waffle with chive cream! Oh my my my my my!  GO! GO NOW!  Friendly service, cozy decor, a little on the pricier side but well well worth even more."}
{"text":"Évitez ce resto le dimanche si vous êtes un groupe de 6 ou plus. Minimum 90 minutes d'attente :( mauvaise gestion des tables."}
{"text":"Bon petit déjeuner original mais 45 min de lineup plus jamais je me serais cru à un manège à la ronde"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Be prepared to wait for a table but it is worth it.  If Id be living just a little bit closer Id be eating at Regine Café every single day.  This is one of the best places in Montreal where to have brunch."}
{"text":"Très bon déjeuner/brunch. Un peu cher étant donné que tout est en extra (aucun breuvage compris) mais les plats sont recherchés et gouteux. Essayez leurs brioches, c'est la meilleure que j'ai mangé!!"}
{"text":"J'y suis allée pour un brunch et la file en vallait la peine! Le décor est trop joli, le service était enjoué et les plats : délicieux! Un 4 1/2 étoiles tout à fait mérité !"}
{"text":"Le Régine Café je crois est la meilleure place en ville pour le brunch. Je suis en amour avec Tante Régine et ses plats. Je suis allée avec une amie à moi et on a décidé de prendre un plat et la tour \"Un peu de tout\" pour deux. On est tombée en amour. Tous les délices de cette place sont à recommander. Surtout le fameux caramel aux bananes qui devraient être vendu en pot tellement qu'il est bon. J'en mangerais tous les jours. TOUS LES JOURS.  C'est bien compris? Offrez moi Régine et du caramel aux bananes et vous avez quelqu'un d'heureux pour le reste de sa vie."}
{"text":"The cafe au lait, the food, the decor. It's a must to stop by here if you are visiting Montreal. I wanted to eat here morning and night. Their latte reminded me of my travels to Europe - it's coffee you can't really find in NYC. Their breakfast/brunch menu - if I could, I would live in Montreal for this place.  Get their latte bowl because you will never get enough of it. Their poached pear, goat cheese french toast is mind blowing.  Magnifique!"}
{"text":"My favourite brunch place in the city, and I've been to many! It always exceeds my expectations. It's a little pricey for brunch, but it's definitely worth it. Last time I went, I had the granola, and couldn't believe how delicious and beautifully presented it was. The grilled cheese is also fantastic."}
{"text":"I almost wish you won't read this review because I know you will now wait in line too next weekend... But Regine really deserve her 5 star review so here it is:  I loved that they care of us outside while we wait (the water, the cinnamon buns) I was blown away and it made the difference of us waiting or going somewhere else.  So 20 minutes wait but it's worth it. The free shooter won me over: delicious and the food is amazing! Please don't change the menu before I get to try it all!   Loved the decor, loved the flowers on the table, everything!!   Home sweet home!"}
{"text":"Super ambiance! Délicieux brunch!  Le cadre: Extérieur et Intérieur Charmant. Touche de baroque. Belle luminosité. Et surtout beaucoup de confort: super spacieux. Petit +, les livres... L'accueil: Une attente bien gérée par le personnel. C'est une place populaire donc notre temps d attente de 30 min un lundi d été à 13h30 laisse présager une longue attente les fins de semaine. Personnel attentionné et convivial. Le menu: Très varié ! Plats copieux et joliment présentés. Nous nous sommes laissés tenter par la Tartine et le Sucrée Salée. Savoureux. Prix: Vraiment correct. Moyenne de 16doll par plat. Moins de 4doll pour les jus pressés so fresh!!  Manque de proposition de salade de fruits frais.  Manque un plat type Cabane à sucre. J'y retournerai avec des amis de passage sur Montréal sans hésiter!!!"}
{"text":"Everything is colourful and beautiful - from the decors to the food! Perfect place in town for brunch! Read more on my blog on http://theforbiddenmeal.com/2014/10/13/regine-cafe-brunching/"}
{"text":"\"Petits\" déjeuners  gargantuesque, il faut se lever tôt pour espérer y avoir une place dans faire la file pendant 1 heure. Les bébés et enfants y sont bienvenus. Les plats sont divains!"}
{"text":"Tout simplement une coche au dessus des restos déjeuner brunch. Le jambon effiloché et les oeufs écossais sont complètement fous."}
{"text":"I was visiting Montreal from New York with a friend. We decided to check out this place for brunch on recommendation from a friend. I have to say it didn't disappoint! First of all the decor was so cute. The food was amazing!! Everything that came out of the kitchen looked so delicious. And top it off, our waitress Melanie was very sweet and kind. She made our day!   I would definitely recommend eating here while in Montreal."}
{"text":"Très bonne ambiance. J'adore le décor :) chaises confortables. Petit bar accueillant. Serveurs sympathiques qui connaissent leur menu. Bonne qualité de nourriture et cuisson excellente. Nous n'avons manqué de rien. Je recommande ce restaurant à tous. Et certainement que j'y retournerai !!!!"}
{"text":"This place is eggcelent. I really like what they've been bacon. The cof(fee) wasn't bad either for the meal. The wait staff was abso-fruitly great and peary helpful. All in all, I would definitely be syr(up) for another visit. I'm glad I could yelp you to decide to eat your next breakfast.  Seriously though, this place is amazing. Possibly the best breakfast I've ever had. My favorite place to get breakfast in Montreal."}
{"text":"Excellent. Des déjeuners uniques. Un menu qui sort de l'ordinaire. Le décor est très beau. L'ambiance est bonne. Le prix est un peu plus haut que la moyenne mais pour l'expérience, ça vaut la peine."}
{"text":"Super trendy and tons of fun. The food was beautifully plated, very hearty and great service!!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing!! I went here for brunch with my boyfriend while visiting Montreal because we were recommended to go here by a chef in Montreal who knows the owner. This place has such a cool and hip environment and so many delicious and unique options on their menu. I had the hardest time deciding what to get because I waned it all! They really did an amazing job making our food and such a great presentation they way the food is delivered. It is a fun and fancy experience, but also a relaxed and chill place at the same time. I highly recommend eating here, so delicious!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service impeccable, menu frais et incomparable avec les autres restaurants à déjeuné, qualité des aliments et du produit fini est savoureuse, le prix ainsi que le volume du plat sont les seule faiblesses (négligeable) de ce sympathique endroit!  P.s. le décor vous amèneras chez votre grand tante c'est une promesse ;)"}
{"text":"Regine café is basically the reason why I wake up every morning. Seriously though. Every time I try another brunch spot, no matter how amazing it is, I always regret not going to Regine so I've accepted the fact that I have attachment issues and nothing can come between me and this café.  Usually on weekends you'll end up waiting in line for 30 minutes. But it's worth the wait. I would camp outside for days if necessary.   The first thing they give you right after you're seated is a shot of their juice of the day. They're all amazing, delicious, and addicting   Regardless of what you order, ALWAYS GET A SCOTCH EGG ON THE SIDE. IT IS THE DEFINITION OF HEAVEN. They are so good I literally want an entire bag to take home with me. So anytime you grab anything off of the menu, just ask for a scotch egg on the side, you definitely won't regret it.   The top two meals that I always get is the Champi and the Sucré Salé.   The Champi: you get a big slice of rustic bread and on top you have the melted 1608 cheese... Then you have the mushrooms. The mushrooms are so delicious. They're perfectly sauteed. And then you have two poached eggs. You have the choice to replace them with the scotch egg. I usually get the scotch egg on the side. The entire meal comes the amazing mashed potatoes that have so much flavour. It's my favourite dish. I like to also add some pulled ham on the side as well to complete it.   Sucré Salé: if you're up for dessert after then get this  dish but you should probably consider splitting it with someone since it's considered a meal! It can also be paired with the scotch egg if you'd like but basically it's the perfect mix with sweet and savoury. You have the French toast that's ooooozing with syrup and on top you have the pulled ham, sunny side up egg and huge chunks of CREAM FUDGE.   Honestly... Get both. Worst case you feel extremely full and maybe end up at the emergency room.. But at least you got a taste of heaven so there is nothing to regret.     - @hanaer"}
{"text":"Super brunch !!!! Délicieux, assiettes copieuses, belle présentation presque parfait....sauf l'attente interminable (plus d'une heure dehors dans le froid) mais bon un thé chaud nous a été servi dans la file d'attente. Super attention :)"}
{"text":"J'y retourne  avec des amies....impossible  de résister à l'attraction  du bon et du beau"}
{"text":"I first ate at Café Régine last July with my best friend, whose round luscious belly was ready to deliver her son, today a beautiful friendly type who attracts patrons with his elfin grin. We arrive early and thankfully so: The lineup is too long to wait outside in the cold, even with the cup of coffee the restaurant staff offer them. While we wait for the \"Un Peu de Tout\" pastry plate tower, I talk to a patron from Repentigny at a lovely table with chrysanthemums to discuss his weekend away plans.  We start with a fresh clementine-pineapple-mint shot and then ravish the cinnamon brioche, miniature brioche with pear butter, and crumpet with bitter orange marmalade. The cranberry, toasted almond, Earl Grey-infused scone and strawberry jam accompaniment for the baguette are equally enticing. There is a yummy Nutella side and a perfectly balanced lemon curd. I willingly dive for salted caramel at the bottom of the yogurt crème brûlée. The tower highlight is the crushed butter cookie (pailleté feuilletine) and peanut butter in the white saucer.   The chef, Gregory Chandler, prepared and artfully arranged the savory Gaufré : a light and fluffy waffle with candied onion, smoked salmon, chive and cream cheese. My Mish Mash is nice, although lacking salt even with the lardon. The manager Charles explains that aside for the baguette from Arhoma, everything is made fresh here. The strawberries are from a Charlevoix producer, provenance unknown. The lovely waitress Christine is ever patient and forgiving. I'd return for more before the baby is much older."}
{"text":"Depuis que j'ai mon blog gourmand (la boufferie), je lis de plus en plus de blogs et donc, de plus en plus de critiques... Régine Café est une de ces places dont tout le monde parle...  Je ne suis pas fanatique des brunchs... c'est pourquoi, malgré que toutes les critiques que j'avais entendues jusqu'à maintenant sur cet endroit étaient bonnes, j'ai autant tardé à y aller. Quelle erreur! J'irais tous les jours!  Un shooter de bienvenue est offert à votre arrivée (un cocktail de fruit).  Ensuite, c'est la lecture du menu.  Tout a l'air bon. que ce soit le pain doré au pain d'épices, la gaufre de maïs et gravlax de saumon, etc... Les portions sont plus que copieuses.  Même si les assiettes sont gigantesques et que vous n'arriverez sûrement pas à la finir, prenez tout de même une brioche en extra. Leurs brioches sont les meilleures que j'aie mangées!  Les cocktails de fruits sont servis dans de grosses coupes.  Certains disent que c'est cher.... Ça m'a coûté 32$ pour un cocktail de fruits, une brioche, mon repas et le tips.... Les assiettes sont immenses, tout est délicieux et on est loin des oeufs-bacon-patates. Je trouve le prix justifié et j'en ai eu pour mon argent."}
{"text":"J'avais envie d'essayer un nouvel endroit pour déjeuner, où les plats me surprendraient, et pas facile de trouver un tel style de brunch ouvert un jour de semaine (mercredi)! Après une recherche net, nous nous sommes donc dirigées ma colloque et moi vers le Régine café. Nous avons toutes les deux aimé l'endroit: nos plats, tous deux des plats du jour (pain/brioche dorée aux fraises et fromage à la crème; omelette au chorizo, olives et oignons caramélisés) étaient délicieux. Le service était fort sympathique, et on nous a assises immédiatement. Le prix vaut le coût pour la quantité, la qualité de la nourriture et du service, et les plats qui sortent des chantiers battus du monde du déjeuner.   On y va pour:  - la variété alléchante et originale du menu - un resto indépendant de brunch ouvert la semaine - les petits shooters de jus frais servis à l'arrivée - le service amical  Bref, l'endroit est assez loin de chez moi (ndg), mais j'y retournerai éventuellement pour sûr pour essayer les autres plats (et douceurs!) au menu!  Pourquoi moins une étoile - le décor n'est pas dans mon style, et si l'on est pas du quartier c'est moyen accessible (pas si proche du métro)."}
{"text":"Que dire?? C'est definitivement le meilleur brunch que j'ai pu tester jusqu'a présent. Beaucoup de choix, le service est top, les plats sont généreux et sortent de l'ordinaire.  Seul bémol, il faut prendre son mal en patience... beaucoup d'attente le week end..."}
{"text":"We love this place, good food, nice staff and pretty look. Get ready to wait in line on the weekend But worth the try"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful brunches!   Every plate is presented with style and the taste was wonderful.  It's definitely one of my favorites and possibly one of the best ones I've been to.  Great atmosphere, the setting gives that upscale feel.  Price is very reasonable, two can dine for about $50 with drinks.  \"Chic Croissant\" was excellent, croissant was very well baked and crispy.  The ham between the croissant was really tender.  The spinach sauce added a great flavor to it.  The other dish that was extremely great was the omelette of the day.  We went with a group of 4 adults and tried their dishes as well, all of them were really good and I'm extremely happy that I found this place.  Expect long line up at this place, we went on Friday at noon and there were number of people standing outside waiting.  There are street parking available."}
{"text":"Heard about this Cafe from a friend and dropped in on a Sunday morning for brunch. This seemed like a popular local place for brunch so it was packed and my boyfriend and I waited around 40 minutes to be seated. I really liked the decor and the pastries looked really good. Service was spotty; had to get a different waiter to see what was going on with our order because we could never flag down our original waiter.  I ordered the grilled cheese with duck confit (extra) and a fruit smoothie while my boyfriend ordered a moccachino and a croissant sandwich with eggs, ham, aged cheddar and spinach sauce.  I enjoyed my sandwich but not my fruit smoothie (sour as if unripe fruits were used) and my boyfriend enjoyed his mocca but not so much his sandwich. He wasn't full after his meal so if you tend to have a bigger appetite I'd say go somewhere else.  Good brunch but not worth going out of the way and waiting in line for. Not ideal for big groups if you wanted to get seated quickly so I would say to be seated comfortably and quickly you shouldn't be a group bigger than 4."}
{"text":"Came here on a rainy Sunday morning, hoping that there'd be no line on such a cold day. Alas, my hopes were dashed when I spotted a huge crowd waiting outside, even in the rain. My friend and I waited for almost an hour, but we both agreed that it was so worth it. The employees were also really considerate - While we were waiting, they came out and offered both brioche bites and warm tea.   When we were seated, we were given a free shot of their juice (ours was a blend of cucumber, milk, and honeydew, which sounded strange but was actually quite refreshing !).  Everything on the menu looked so good, and it was so difficult choosing what to order - My friend and I ended up ordering the Champi and the Tartine, which were both extremely delicious. The Champi is basically poached eggs and sautéed mushrooms atop a layer of cheese on rustic bread, which I really enjoyed. The Tartine was tomatoes, scrambled eggs, spicy sausage and ricotta cheese on top of rustic bread, which was also super flavourful. Our dishes also came with a side of mashed potatoes and fresh fruit, leaving us full and very satisfied.  The employees were always friendly and courteous and helpful with suggestions as well, and the interior of the restaurant is super cute and fancy (like a high tea place).   Can't wait to come back to try the other dishes!"}
{"text":"Definitely not worth the wait. The food is ok. Nothing more then that. Fine, it's good, but not worth waiting for, even for 5 minutes. A lot of hype."}
{"text":"Good eats, need to visit and try for yourself. Omelets are great there. Duck confit and the sweet pastry platter are also winners. Over all nice place to go to."}
{"text":"Excellente poutine à déjeuner! Ambiance très agréable!"}
{"text":"yes yes yes! can there be a better brunch place in this town? i think not!! i am in love!"}
{"text":"Super good! So yummy Best breakfast ever that I had!  I loved everything :from the decoration to the service , to the quality of our meals !!! Try their white hot chocolate !!!!! Mmmmm"}
{"text":"Les brunchs sont très originaux et savoureux. J'y suis allée plus d'une fois et j'y retournerais encore! L'ambiance est chaleureuse et le décor est éclectique."}
{"text":"Très bon brunch mais victime de son succès, il faut y aller tôt si on ne veut pas s'embarquer dans une file interminable! Les plats sont très copieux, originaux et très bons!"}
{"text":"I think this is the best restaurant in Montreal. Best food for sure. The staff was perfectly attentive but not pushy. The whole atmosphere was romantic."}
{"text":"Simply put, a beautiful classy brunch place your mom/sister are sure to love. Delicious options, and filling portions. Unique interior that feels like a homage to \"Aunt Regine\"! ;)"}
{"text":"C'etait tellement parfait que nous songeons carrement a demenager a Montreal juste pour  yaller tous les week ends ! Bon on a du faire un peu la queue pour rentrer mais le manager nous a proposé un parapluie puis il etait tres acceuillant!  Nous avons eu le droit a un petit shot de vitamines avant meme de commander puis nos plats etaient juste parfait ! A faire, puis a refaire."}
{"text":"Tous les aliments sont colorés, des déjeuners délicats et délicieux. Le service super sympathique, les sièges confortables et la déco est chic. Nous étions 4 (1 jeune de 8 ans, 3 adultes) pour un brunch du dimanche entre amies. Nous avons trouvé du stationnement gratuit en tournant dans le quadrilatère, Régine est dans nos coups de cur. Le bémol qui explique le 4* c'est l'attente, car on attend longtemps dans la file puisqu'il est impossible de réserver pour le brunch du dimanche. L'été au soleil ça se tolère bien car ils installent des parasols et ils offrent de l'eau aux fruits/herbes rafraîchissantes à volonté durant l'attente. L'hiver ça demande une bonne dose de d'auto-motivation."}
{"text":"Best Brunch ever! Everything is so good. The service is okay. I love this place. One of my favourite spot for Brunch!"}
{"text":"Expect long lines or make a reservation! The staff are absolutely fantastic, they brought out hot chocolates for us waiting in line outside. It gets super crowded so make sure you go early. I got their french toast with bananas, caramel popcorn and marscapone cream. It really satisfied my sweet tooth to the point it was a bit overwhelming towards the end. It was super filling and delicious but I would have ordered something else.. which means I have to come back again. They had a bunch of baked goods on sale as well if you wanted to grab something on the way out. It's slightly pricier than your standard brunch."}
{"text":"Overhyped by mtl blog and online marketing budget. Food is greasy, tasteless, heavy and overpriced. The staff is friendly and good, but not worth the visit to rosemont. Don't waste time/money/health."}
{"text":"The last thing this place needs is yet another good review. Everything is good here - the sweet choices as much as the salty. My favorite plate at the moment is the smoked trout waffle, simply to die for! If it wasn't for the lineup, I'd have brunch here every weekend."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I was not impressed by my plate at all, it was very bland. I was expecting a lot more based on the reviews. We went pretty early so we wouldn't have to wait in the long line and I'm happy that we avoided the line since it's definitely not worth the wait.  The service and decor were good."}
{"text":"Had brunch here on Monday morning. Short wait, excellent food, great service! A small, but well curated menu is definitely a plus as well!"}
{"text":"Exceptional! Even though we waited for quite a long time outside with only some cucumber water (I hate cucumber) to quench our thirst, it was worth it! We had a tower of dessert which is basically a little bit of everything like toast, scone, yaourt brûlé, lemon curd, orange marmelade and such. It was really good! We were three on it and didn't manage to finish it! It deserves such a reputation. But it's preferable to go during the week as you can reserve your place which you can't do on the weekends."}
{"text":"Fellow Yelpers, I was dragged here by my girlfriend and I am the first to admit I dislike fancy food places. I prefere traditional breakfast! I am leaving this place with one heck of a different view on Regine Cafe. Not only is the service excellent and friendly but the food was beyond what I expected!! The taste was amazing, the portion was just right and the juice (i had a cherry and pear smoothy with yogurt) was yummy. It's a little pricy but I expected that coming in. In conclusion, I can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Vraiment bon resto de déjeuner!! Superbe décor, bonnes portions, menu très différent et super intéressant!! La file d'attente est par contre longue les fins de semaines, mais vous ne serez pas déçu... Le service est très très bien!!"}
{"text":"Pure délice!  Les lieux sont superbes et l'ambiance très sympa. La carte est hallucinante tout y est alléchant et les propositions sont dignes des meilleurs tables gastronomiques. Et même si il faut attendre dehors dans le froid souvent pendant 1h, du thé chaud est servi avec dégustation de brioche et le tout sous de belles peaux (synthétique)  de bêtes."}
{"text":"One of my fave brunch place in MTL. Everything is delicious and the items on the menu aren't the typical brunch food. You can get salmon croquette, mushrooms, trout gravlax, scottish egg, etc. They also have gluten free options and lactose free drinks.   The place is nicely decorated and has a fancy tea place ambiance. It's perfect for chilling with friends. The staff is friendly and nice and the wait time to get the food isn't long.   Brace yourself for some line up, especially during the weekends."}
{"text":"My S.O. and I stayed at an Air BNB and this place was recommend for brunch. This spot is officially my favourite brunch spot in all of Montréal. We went on a Sunday and if you go early to line up before it opens you are likely to get a seat.  I found their dishes very creative and innovative. They were able to accomplish layers of diverse flavours and textures that just kept me wanting more.  The Gaufré I ordered was absolutely delightful. The saltiness of the trout with the fresh chive cream in combination of the flavorful corn waffle and the pickled onions to add acidity was divine. Highly recommend!  We got the cinnamon bun on the side and they were light and fluffy with a slight crisp on the top. I prefer the original over the caramel apple.  The café has a classy Victorian look and the servers made it a great experience. Servers were also very good and attentive.  I would definitely come back again next time I am in Montréal.  Food - 5/5 Service - 4/5 Atmosphere - 4.5/5"}
{"text":"Love the place! When we got there around 11am on a Sunday, the line up was going all the way to the corner of the street. We had to wait about 20-25 minutes to get a table for two people (which is a shorter wait than I expected--the place actually has a good number of tables). Well worth the wait: the food was delicious. I had the croissant with egg and cheese in it, and topped with spinach sauce. Also tried the sides of crumpet and home-made chocolate spread (so good!), and the scones with mascarpone and marmelade. Delicious! The decor is pretty and clean. We had a table right by the window; great spot. Good service; they made us feel that it was OK to hang around to chat even when we were done eating. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Régine café est vraiment devenu un de mes spots pref pour dej à montréal ! La file est souvent longue mais prenez le temps de la faire, car les plat sont plus qu'excellent.   j'ai gouté à la croquette de saumon, ca peut sembler un peu simple, mais honnêtement c'est un des meilleures déjeuner que j'ai mangé dans ma vie. Le restaurant est aussi super beau et le service est impeccable.  Bref, même si la file est un peu longue, ils sont assez gentil pour servir de l'eau fruité pour aidé à patienter, alors aucune raison de ne pas attendre !!!"}
{"text":"Eclectic delicious entrees In vintage French parlor setting.  Worth the wait! Crumpets. Scottish eggs, gourmet corn or chocolate waffles all excellent."}
{"text":"Puisque tout le monde parlait autant en bien du Régine Café, je me devais d'aller y faire un tour... Et je n'ai pas été déçue! Évidemment, comme tout bon restaurant de brunchs à Montréal, il faut arriver assez tôt pour ne pas faire la file dehors.  Le décor est super joli, à la fois très moderne, mais avec des touches classiques. Wow! De longues tables sont mêmes disponibles pour accueillir les groupes (12 personnes environ?), ce qui est très bien! Puisque l'endroit est assez achalandé, c'est un peu bruyant, mais bon... Quel restaurant ne l'est pas à l'heure du brunch le dimanche? Notre serveur était hyper gentil et nous a expliqué très professionnellement quelles étaient les créations spéciales du jour en plus de répondre à nos questions concernant le menu. Tout avait l'air siiiiiiii délicieux! J'ai opté pour le déjeuner classique (oeufs, pommes de terre et fromage avec baguette) et j'ai bien aimé. Mon café au lait était excellent! Les assiettes de mes amies avaient l'air décadendes et elles ont toutes été satisfaites de leur choix, mais ont trouvé les portions un peu grosses.   Même si nous sommes restées assez longtemps, jamais le serveur ne nous a fait sentir que nous devions partir. Il nous a même offert un café supplémentaire!   J'y retournerai assurément pour goûter à d'autres plats et admirer la superbe décoration de l'endroit!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch spot. Really delicious hot chocolate, with the home made marshmallow on top, the Champi is a sin, especially with the Scottish egg. The corn flour waffles with gravlax (or is it smoked trout?) is to die for. I had it at least 5 times and it was always super good. Consistency is the key.  Two things I didn't like:  I once tried their grilled cheese and I was horribly disappointed. Hard and dry.  The orange or grapefruit juice is coming from those 1$ Oasis box. And they make you pay 3.5$ if I remember well...   But overall it's a great brunch place and I will continue to go there during my visits in Montreal."}
{"text":"Wow... Montreal is a city of brunch, and we have really done the rounds, and can honestly say NOTHING comes close to Régine café... It is so good from start to finish, from coffee to tea, from eggs to scones, to homemade nutella and various nut butters and banana butters,... and so much goodness and freshness and made by hand-ness... Honestly we went with a group and literally tried the entire menu and had nothing bad to say. Service was perfect, a smile from every waitstaff, attention to our every need, great recommendations- really cannot imagine a better experience.  Ambiance is so welcoming, and charming and eclectic, and noise level is perfect for conversation.  The only complaint we had was that our stomachs were not big enough to accommodate all the food...  go out and enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"Nothing out of the ordinary. We went on a Sunday -- the line was very long. We waited about 30 minutes outside in the cold. The staff did come out with tea while we waited, which was lovely. The food is ok, just not worth the price. I found the menu to be small and lacking simple choices."}
{"text":"Excellent et original au gout !  Belle decoration a l'interieur.  Il fait arriver TÔT la fin de semaine !"}
{"text":"Regine is more upscale brunch place compared to L'Avenue. The food is great and chic, but portions are on a smaller side. It is worth visiting."}
{"text":"There aren't a ton of vegetarian options here but the ones I tried were delicious. The grilled cheese lacked some salt but made up for it with a deliciously rustic bread. The accompanying salad and fruit were nice complements. The cinnamon brioche we started with was eggy and not too sweet. The soy latte bowl hit the spot. The staff could not have been friendlier."}
{"text":"Super belle nouveauté dans le quartier Rosemont, le Café Régine offre une belle selection de déjeuner et brunch. Le service y est super gentil et l'ambiance est très joviale.  Essayez un samedi matin, on nous acceuille avec un jus de betterave à la canelle. Pas tout à fait dans mes goûts mais ça vous réveille d'une seule traite. Du traditionnel oeuf-bacon au pain doré en passant par des grilled cheesed au cheddar fort, le menu ecclectique saura plaire à tout le monde. Cependant, puisqu'il n'y a pas de réservation la fin de semaine, je vous conseille d'y arriver tôt (9h30) car à notre sortie, il y avait une file d'attente qui s'étendait jusqu'en dehors de l'établissement."}
{"text":"Not going to lie, I had the most amazing brunch here. Went with a group of friends so we got to try a bit of everything. I ordered the Gaufre (trout gravlax on corn waffle) and it was by far the most outstanding dish of our table. We ordered the 3 tiered $20 assortment of pastries to share and it was just ok, probably wouldn't order it again (2/3 of the tier was basically bread in different forms). The Sucre Sale (pulled pork on french toast) was ok. If you do come, I highly recommend you come before 10am. We arrived at 1pm and had to wait an hour in line to get a spot."}
{"text":"During our 40 minute wait on line, the host brought us out a sample of bread. Talk about excellent customer service! The menu had a wonderful selection of meals to choose from. Upon sitting down, we were given a taste of the carrot orange juice. It was delicious. We tried the chic croissant, gros jambon, crumpets et Nutella and beurre de banane.  The marshmallow in the hot chocolate was absolutely amazing.  The pulled pork was like nothing I've tried before. Service was superb. Our waitress was lovely and knowledgeable and helped me decide on what to order. Great recommendations! Decor was beautiful, and the place was really clean. This place was truly an incredible experience. And for such an upscale place, I was shocked to see how reasonable the prices were!"}
{"text":"Great service. Super delicious. It was my first time ever trying a scotch egg, and it was amazing. I had the Gaufre. Very tasty. I loved it."}
{"text":"I had heard many good things about this place and was excited to give it a try.  I arrived there with some friends on a Saturday morning. There was line up but fortunately the wait wasn't too long. Line ups are usually a good sign for yummy things to come.  The decor is wonderful, a mix of victorian chic and modern industrialism. In the background you can hear the faint sound of oldies' music. I'm in love already.   The menu is only 1 page-long but quite varied and printed playfully on a paper placemat. I personally love short menus because (usually) the kitchen can focus on making things right.  I ordered a refreshing mimosa to which our friendly and knowlegeable waitress brought us complimentary samples of the \"cocktail du jour\" which was a delicious blend of orange and peach juice and a hint of basil. For the main event I chose the special of the day which was decadent plate of duck confit, scalloped potatoes with bacon, caramelized onions and cheese all accompanied by a poached egg, fresh salad of baby spinach, fennel and yellow beets with a tasty crouton and heavenly homemade orange marmelade. U-n-b-e-l-e-i-v-a-b-l-e! This is definitely not your Chez Cora brunch fare. Plus everything is beautifully presented. Somehow I even managed to fit in an order of churros with chocolate cayenne pepper sauce. Sweet, delectable, non greasy, cinnamon-sugared plate of happiness :)  I will definitely come back here again. Even if I have to brave a blizzard, it's that good!"}
{"text":"Location: On Beaubien East, not far from Papineau. I have no idea how transit would get you there, however street parking is available (it's not zoned for residents) and if you arrive before they open, you should have no problem getting a spot. I arrived around 8:40 on a Sunday and parked in front of the restaurant.   The place: Love the space and the decor! It's bright and fresh. A little condensed in the main dining area, but I'm not running laps around the restaurant so you know, no big deal.   The goods: We all started with a Mokacino, and we all loved it. It was the perfect blend of coffee and chocolate. So good in fact, that we all ordered a second cup.  In terms of brunch, I ordered the grilled cheese - since I basically embarked on a weekend of gluttony on Friday night, I figured I may as well end it with a bang. The grilled cheese was made up of 2-year old cheddar, caramelized onions and walnut and pistachio bread. Unbeknownst to me, it was also accompanied for a lovely green salad with mango chutney, and the best, best, best potatoes EVER. The grilled cheese was amazing and I love that bread. The cheese wasn't overly salty at all, the bread was nice and crispy, and I frequently chewed on some pistachios and walnuts. Yum! The salad was super fresh (I'm not sure what type of dressing was on it but it was very light) and the mango chutney was delicious. I was really happy with my breakfast, though I think I'll remain full for at least a week after all this food! One friend ordered the Chic croissant, while the other ordered the Mish Mash - both loved their dishes. We also shared crumpets with the homemade Nutella and it was awesome. Overall, a great brunch chez ma tante Régine. So, when can we move in?  Service: Very good. Our waiter was friendly and he made sure we always had water. Service was a bit slow, but honestly, the place was packed within 10 minutes of opening so I can't really fault them for this. We weren't in a hurry anyway.  Price point: For the giant grilled cheese board, two coffees and a side of bacon, it came to about $30 with tip."}
{"text":"After a disastrous night attending the restaurant Grillade Lafirenze it was made up for by having a delicious Sunday morning breakfast at Régine Café. First off I was surprised by the huge line up on par with the restaurant Schwartz's and it was raining and much to my surprise one of the workers came out and provided people waiting outside with umbrella's which was very thoughtful and showed me they really have the customer's satisfaction as a huge focus which every restaurant should keep that in mind.  They also provided samples of a red velvet cake as well as a cinnibun for the people waiting outside which was delicious.  Me being a sweet tooth sufferer I ordered the Pain Dore which was a superb dish of french toasts, banana's, dates,caramel,pecans and cream and was placed on the plate in a astonishing way, I also ordered crumpets with some homemade nutella which was mouth watery delicious, the nutella that is. My girl ordered the Gros Jambon which appeared fantastic( I should of sampled it)  The decor is nice as well andI will be attending back in the near future."}
{"text":"Le resto à déjeuner (brunch) le plus inventif et délicieux que je connaisse!   Ils ne prennent pas les réservations la fin de semaine alors vous risquez d'attendre très longtemps si vous êtes une gang.  J'y suis allée 2 fois et chaque repas était à tomber par terre! J'ai mangé le \"Champi\" une délicieuse assiette d'oeufs pochés, de fromage et de champignons. Je n'ai pas regretté l'extra de 3$ pour l'Oeuf écossais. Essayez et vous verrez!   Ah oui et la déco est superbe également! Délicieux repas et bon service!"}
{"text":"Toujours un succès! Grand choix de petits trucs à goûter (crumpets, scones, brioche cannelle, jambon effiloché, saucisse de canard,..) ainsi que les plats de brunch évidemment! Les plats sont variés, il y en a pour tous les goûts, et ils sont surtout très originaux.. Il y a autant de sucré que de salé, avec truite fumé, épinards, jambon effiloché, etc... On vous apporte un petit shooter de smoothie ou jus mélangé du jour en dégustation Seul truc à savoir: attendez vous à faire au moins 30mn de file à partir de 10h.. mais ça vaut la peine! ;)"}
{"text":"A cute eatery with a creative and delicious brunch menu! Gravlax with the corn waffles were a fun twist on a classic combination. The crumpets were sweet and a good \"dessert\" option. I suggest going early as it fills up really quickly!"}
{"text":"Waited in line for about 40 mins, BUT worth the waiting!!!!!! Service was really good, always smile and kind to us, the food was delicious, if you are looking for something is not so heavy and healthy, recommend this one! It will give you full of flavours in your mouth and you can not get tired of it! Definitely will go back there again!"}
{"text":"Excellente table. Service courtois et attentionné. Menu varié et inventif. Belles découvertes culinaires!"}
{"text":"LOVE. THIS. PLACE. ! My friend and I who live in New York City came to Montreal for his 30th birthday and decided to come to Regine Cafe upon the recommendation of a friend - it did not disappoint! This place is the whole package! Food - delicious! Quality - amazing! Price - can't beat it! Staff - SO personable, friendly and fun! Our server, Melanie, hands down is the best server I've ever had - anywhere! Fun, extremely knowledgeable of all food/drink items, incredibly competent in taking care of our needs AND even came out with a sundae with sparklers for my friend's birthday! Thank you Melanie & Regine Cafe --- we are raving about this place to all our friends in NYC/The States and can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was the number 1 on my brunch list in Montreal. But I was very deceived when I walked there the last time.   It was not clean as usual. And we seated close to the kitchen and the cooks were screaming like crazy and I think it was not professional.   After 3pm, do not ask anything because it is close.   Bad experience"}
{"text":"Très bon bouffe, menu original, belle déco, je n'ai rien à redire si ce n'est que ce resto est victime de son succès et que l'attente y est très longue le week-end.  Donc arrivez tôt, ou préparez-vous à attendre. Aucune réservation non plus malheureusement. Allez s'y avec quelqu'un d'ouvert au changement, car il ne s'agit pas de votre resto déjeuné habituel."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch while visiting Montreal. Although had to stand in a bit of a lineup, it was all worth it...What a great stylish place and tasty food! My husband had 70% hot chocolate which came with a marshmallow and milk that you whisk-in, mint and cucumber lemonade looked great too."}
{"text":"Though it might take a while to be seated, this place is absolutely worth the wait!!! The dishes are original and gorgeous, the staff is very kind, extremely helpful and accommodating (food allergies here) and never snob.  After eating at that kind of breakfast place, I really dont see why I would eat breakfast in a chain of restaurants. We had the scone with marmelade and lemon cream, the corn waffles with gravlax and finally the mish mash (scrambled eggs of the day). The espresso and the spicy hot chocolate were really good. And also the little sample of their daily juice was a nice touch. Definitely a must when in Montreal!"}
{"text":"i ordered the wrong thing compared to the others i was eating with but everything was solid, fresh, and served to us in a super-chill-yet-never-inefficient-or-impolite manner. no complaints at all, and that ham, dayum."}
{"text":"A cute brunch spot with a menu full of alcoholic drinks too. Nicely decorated atmosphere with mismatched damask-y chairs and curly swirls. The walls are painted a sombre black, but it just makes the atmosphere more plush. Get here early and get in line. You want to be in the first wave of brunch seating. Make sure your whole party is present or you may not be seated...   I'm on a diet so did not go all out with food but if you want to go all out, there are certainly delicious options. Add some beer + orange juice mix as well as a Bailey's Coffee and you're all set. Bread was a bit tough, but maybe it had been toasted. I just had 1 bite though since I'm on the low-carb diet phase.   Service was excellent and food came out very quickly. I never felt rushed during the meal - which is a good thing. I was a bit concerned with the growing line outside that we would be herded in and out like sheep to increase the turnover. No, that did not happen. We still had time to chat and do the brunch-time-linger.  Oh - the meal started with this pleasant carrot juice shot. Very nice touch. I love it when there are little details like that during meals."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast!!! It worth the half an hour waiting with my bestie in the cold, their service is simply amazing to not say the best costumer service ever The food is extremely tasty, they accommodate you not only with your allergies but even with your wishes... You can basically even mix different plates in one. Their smoothies are also fresh home made and delicious at the same time. I had the Scottish egg instead regular ones that would have come base on the menu :) It was to die for!!! Also had scones, that was good (the only thing so so that we got) Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing about Regine Cafe's infamous brunches for many years now, but have never gotten around to trying it because it always seemed out of the way. Well on a recent freezing day, I finally took the leap and made my way into Regine's cozy cafe.   I'll have to admit that I was worried about the lineup that's mentioned in virtually every Yelp review. I ended up arriving around 2:30 pm and didn't have to wait at all, so that may be a good time to go if you want to skip the line.   Upon seating, we were promptly greeted with 2 complimentary shots of their homemade smoothie. It tasted fresh and delicious. We ordered the duck confit grilled cheese, the Champi and a side of Scotch egg. The grilled cheese was delicious and rich, served in perfectly toasted pistachio and nut bread. The Champi consisted of two poached eggs alongside pan-fried mushrooms tossed in sage and butter. It was good, but for some reason I expected more. The Scotch egg was nice though; the egg was wrapped in a spiced sausage and its yolk had a custard-like texture. The whole thing was fried to crispy perfection.   The place was very stylish; there are two rooms and both had a vintage look. Think glossy Damask wallpaper, Louis XIV style sofas and antique frames on a black wall. Just a beautiful space to linger over coffee on a Sunday afternoon.  Their desserts looked delicious, but unfortunately I didn't have any space left. I loved my brunch experience here and look forward to coming back to sample more of the menu!"}
{"text":"It was a long wait but well wotrth it, they came out to serve snacks for the people waitng to be seated. Major bonus points!!! The menu was very creative, definetly not your typical selection, they also had fresh squezzed juices and the prices are reasonable. Overall this palce is a gooo!"}
{"text":"Service here was amazing, something you'd get at a 5 star restaurant (if even) in Toronto, Ontario.  Our hostess brought a chair outside for a kid to sit and baked goods for people waiting in line.  Cons: up to 30 mins wait or more for seating"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the décor of the café! It's super cute, great for pictures and every instagramer's dream. Seats aren't comfortable though. The food is okay, I had the french toast with the ham and I was really dry even with the sauce they provided.  Overall, would I be back? Maybe but it's definitely not my go to brunch"}
{"text":"Amazing french breakfast experience! They have great gluten free breakfast plate options. I had the \" Champi\" plate and totally enjoyed it! Cozy, elegant and delicious!!"}
{"text":"There was a line up to the corner when we arrived, but it moved quickly and we had a seat within 30min.   Our waiter greeted us with a complimentary \"vitamin shooter\" - cranberry juice with carrot, ginger and some other stuff I can't remember - it was a nice touch.   We started with some big latte bowls then I ordered the french toast and the wifey ordered the poached egg and mushroom benny.  Huge portions but I added some duck confit on the side anyways. When in Rome, right? Right!?"}
{"text":"Alors, pour info, un oeuf écossais, c'est pas un oeuf en kilt tout nu dessous. C'est un oeuf bénédictine, enrobé de canard effiloché, et frit.... ouais je sais, ça fait pas mal rêver ! Puis c'est pas mal bon aussi :D Accompagné de ses petits champi, d'une bonne grosse tranche de pain, d'un coulis de poivrons rouges (et de fruits pour la déco). Bah clairement, c'était super !! Plus le petit \"shooter\" fruits rouge-basilic, plus le jus d'orange frais pressé, plus la bonne ambiance chaleureuse avec les gros canap'... au top !!!"}
{"text":"Pour moi le meilleur brunch que j'ai fait sur Montréal sans hésiter. Lorsque Que j'ai vu la file d'attente j'ai tout de suite compris que je n'allais pas n'importe où !  Une fois à l'intérieur nous avons été pris en charge rapidement le service était parfait et rapide !  Les boissons chaude, les jus frais, La brioches, le jambon ... bref tout était parfait.  Des plats très généreux donc faite de la place :)  Je recommanderais Régine à tout le monde à l'avenir car même niveau prix l'excellence est encore la !"}
{"text":"Good food, nice service, happy clients! (If you don't eat much, make sure to share with people!)"}
{"text":"I went there to brunch with a friend for my birthday this year. As far as I know, there is pretty much always a lineup at this restaurant.   The staff is very friendly. They will take care of you and make sure everything is fine.   All food in the menu looks appetizing but you can't eat all in one time! Haha I think you can't go wrong with nothing in this restaurant. Whatever you choose, it's gonna be good :P   I had a little bonus of a birthday red velvet cupcake :) They didn't sing happy birthday to me, also because I asked not to!   Definitely will come back again to try more food from them"}
{"text":"We all came to the conclusion that this was the best breakfast we ever had. 'Nuff said. Highlights were the Chic Croissant, the chocolate waffles, and the pain dore. The service was great. My only suggestion is to order the bowl of coffee over the tasse. Also, try the hot chocolate. It comes with a giant marshmallow with chocolate shavings. Delicious!"}
{"text":"For muslims: I recommend \"un peu de tout\" and \"champi\".  \"un peu de tout\" might be enough for 2 if you are not food dragons. I ordered champi with extra duck meat and it was great.  I was amazed with the servers as they were really understanding and helpful. They were helpful when it came to my dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"Another highly popular brunch place in the middle of nowhere that is a \"must-try\"! I went today for brunch. Got there at around 11:30am and waited 40 minutes to be seated even though we were just 2 people. We got a high table, so we missed out on sitting on the plush, beautiful looking seats other groups were enjoying.  Still, none of this put a damper on my spirits because I was excited to try this place and to see what all of the fuss was about. The waitress was polite and always had a smile on her face (which is refreshing after the horrible waitress I encountered at Le Cheese last week).   Upon sitting down, they served us a green juice shot each, which is a great way to start our digestion before eating anything! The cafe au lait was yummy and a good size, but nothing special compared to Italian coffee served at places like Café Gentile.  The menu is small and limited, with most options involving pork. I ordered the chic croissant without the pulled pork, which wasn't replaced with anything for the same price. I'll never understand why restaurants don't just create a vegetarian version of some plates, where they can add mushrooms, more cheese, etc., to replace the meat. Anyway, this is probably why I felt it was on the small side for the price ($16). It consisted of a small croissant, some scrambled eggs, a little cheese and a delicious spinach bechamel sauce on top (like a pesto). It was served with a few slices of fruit and some greens. Adding some house potatoes on the plate or mushrooms or something would have just tied the whole thing for me.  I actually got a dessert after finishing my plate, which is something I've never done before at a breakfast place. The waitress suggested getting the sucre à la crème brioche which sounded amazing but let me down.  I'm not big on doughy desserts that don't pack a punch flavour-wise.  L'Avenue & Fabergé are better portion and option-wise for those who enjoy savoury foods for breakfast that doesn't include meat. So overall, good service, great flavours but smaller portions and overpriced."}
{"text":"Si tu vas chez Régine, ne t'attends pas à manger une assiette \"oeuf patates bacon\". Oui l'option est sur le menu, mais je vous encourage  fortement à essayer les autres options qui sont toutes aussi éclatées les unes que les autres. Grilled cheese aux noix et fromage d'ici, pain d'épices et beurre caramel banane, yogourt brulé, gaufre et gravlax, les choix sont tous appétissants. J'ai personnellement été laissée charmée parle yogourt aux poires pochées, miel gingembre et granola avec un \"side\" de pain d'épices et beurre caramel banane, tandis que mon amie a pris les scones aux pistaches et le yogourt brûlé. Le yogourt brûlé goûtait spécial, on aime ou on aime pas, mais tout le reste était sublime. Et que dire du service! Rapide et chaleureux, on vous accueillera avec le \"shooter du jour\", une concoction  de jus de fruits et légumes frais qui change selon l'humeur du chef (pour nous ce fut carotte mandarine!). Le décors est magnifique, un mauve riche et des accessoires d'inspiration un peu burlesque, avec la tapisserie à motif et les grand chandeliers noirs au plafond. Et on hésite pas à accompagner notre déjeuner d'un café ou d'un smoothie; mon moka était garni d'une fabuleuse guimauve caramélisée, et le smoothie de mon amie était divin (et énorme!). Pour le Brunch, Régine est un coup de coeur assuré!"}
{"text":"O-M-G. This is my FAVOURITE place for brunch in Montreal by far!  They did not accept reservations, so you have to wait outside; it was a super cold, windy day, and we were given tea in different colored cups! They had props you could play with once inside and waiting for a spot.  The décor is BEAUTIFUL inside and feels very fancy. We tried some of their hot drinks (do yourself a favour and get the salted dark hot chocolate...I could drink two of them)!   They also had a latte in a huge soup bowl which was interesting and fun to hold.  As for food...wow. Each dish was a perfect mix of flavours and had interesting textural and taste contrast.  - Beef cheek: tender, and with a deliciously hearty broth. - Smoked trout: what I go; delicious and with a nice amount of smokiness.  - Regine special: yummy platter of deliciousness consisting of a fried scotch egg, sauces, and meat.   Can't wait to come back!!!  Prices are a bit high but worth it for the quality!"}
{"text":"Endroit plutôt mignon, menu alléchant, mais un peu tantinet cher pour ce que c'est. L'endroit était quand même plein, même en matinée de semaine. C'est bon signe!  Tous les brunchs tournent autour de 15$, mais ça n'inclut même pas le café, ce que je trouve un peu dommage.  J'ai pris le Chic Croissant, un délicieux croissant fourré d'oeufs brouillés, de cheddar et de savoureux jambon effiloché, coiffé d'un coulis de sauce aux épinards (attention à ne pas le verser au complet en partant, le croissant devient trop mou). Accompagné d'une boule de patates pilées bien assaisonnées et de fruits frais, le plat est plus que satisfaisant.   Cool endroit, mais ce n'est pas mon nouveau resto à brunch préféré."}
{"text":"Arrived a Sunday morning at 11:50. Thermometer shown -9 degrees + cold wind.  We waited around 1 hr outside, in the cold weather of the winter. I would never wait so long if i hadn't seen as much as positives comments.  Victims of their success, they gave us hot tea in compensation to support this hard time (I ve to say it was long with the cold wind).  When we finally get in, the waitress addressed us a table. She was lovely at our disposition during our brunch.  Our coffees arrived quickly. And just the time to finish them we got our brunches. We chose mushrooms and ham plates. Cf pictures.  And in desert an Elisabeth Queen cake and a big waffle with pistachio, hot chocolate.  Honestly, i will join the others comments. Maybe its very long for a brunch but the results are worth it !!   It's a Must To Try in Montreal."}
{"text":"We came on a Monday morning before heading back to  NY as we heard this is the best new brunch place in town. We waited in line for about 20min but once inside, the staff was super nice and welcoming. The menu is pretty diversified with a lot of different options going from American breakfast to french staples, all with a twist from Montréal. We had the Doré (sweet french toasts) which were pretty well executed and the Gruau (porridge/oatmeal) that was served with a super nice little peanut crunch . The portions are huge for what you pay and the food is pretty good. I wish it wasn't as sweet as it is.... this stuff is very high in sugar. Overall really nice experience with caring staff. Will come back if I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Make a reservation!!! Great service. Make reservations. Small but quaint. Fresh and tasty. I will return for sure."}
{"text":"******6 STARS hands down, yes 6!****** I can't imagine missing this brunch place from all these years while visiting Montreal!  The decor was an English Victorian setting, the wing-backed chairs were beautifully upholstered and each were unique.  I felt like we were all transported to old England!  We were 8 people and sat at a large round table with a beautiful flower centrepiece.  Right above our table was a dazzling chandelier.   The brunches were unique and innovative.  The presentation is jaw-dropping, definitely Instagram worthy!   Quick tip:  reservations are available on weekdays only, as this place has long line ups all the time...I wonder why?! :)  Enjoy the pics and bon appetit!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, I wasn't really a fan of some parts of the dish but other than that it was fantastic !"}
{"text":"Superbe découverte. La file d'attente en vaut la peine.  Les plats sont beaux et copieux, ça ouvre l'appétit. Le goût est simple (ça reste des déjeuner/brunch), mais le menu est varié ce qui ajoute une dimension recherchée à l'expérience!  Le service est impeccable.  L'endroit est magnifique."}
{"text":"A very fun and delicious brunch spot! Don't come hungry though, we waited for about 45 minutes for a table of 4 (you have to stand in line, they don't take down names). Once you get in though, be prepared for some delicious fortifying food.   We shared an \"un peu de tout\" (3.5/5) which was a 3-tiered assortment of breads and pastries, definitely too much for us considering we were each ordering a brunch dish. Many of the pastries were average, but I did like the baguette, the creme bruleed yogurt, and the dips ESPECIALLY the peanut crumble (we even bought 2 jars to take home).   My GF sister got the grano (5/5), yogurt and granola, which sounds simple but was the best I've ever had. There were so many delicious components in that granola, plenty of mixed roasted nuts, coconut, plump dried fruit, I stole several bites.  The chic croissant (4.5/5) was excellent, infinitely more exciting than a typical breakfast sandwich. The combination of housemade ham and green sauce were delicious, and the croissant and eggs were just right.   The gaufre (4.5/5), corn waffle with salmon gravlax, was surprisingly fluffy and light, and the sweetness of the corn went nicely with the salty gravlax.   The chocolat blanc vanille (5/5) is a treat, and totally worth it. The salty dark chocolate milk (4/5) was also quite good but not as special.   Each brunch dish comes with a lil fruit and salad on the side to make for a complete meal. The staff was super friendly and enthusiastic, and we did not feel rushed even though we were one of the last tables. Loved this spot and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went there last weekend, definitely need to get there early if you don't want to wait much time. They have lemon and orange water for people who are waiting outside. Their decor is very classic. We ordered scotch egg and chef choice. Chef choice is beef steak cooked with red wine which is very tender and tasty. The scotch egg is a little dry for me. For drink, green tea latte is definitely a good choice. I will try other dishes next time."}
{"text":"I ended going to Regine Café on a friday morning after having it recommended by a friend. I'm a great lover of brunch restaurants and this one totally is worth it.   Loved: The shooter-type homemade juice given to us as soon as seated, the original choices on the menu, the cute presentation of the dishes, the rather fast service (note: the restaurant was half full upon arrival).  However, it felt like the place is probably very crowded on weekends as there was already a line up at 9:30. Also, as soon as we were done eating, we felt rushed by the waitress, bringing the bill immediately and suggesting we pay by card. Once paid we felt it was time for us to leave. Probably a downside of crowded places."}
{"text":"The Scottish eggs here are the best dish they have. Very unique and tasty platter. The ambience here makes you feel like you're in a European country like France. I enjoy the food and the environment is pleasant!"}
{"text":"So my sister and I waited over an hour in the rain for this place. So so worth it! Super retro vibe, and amazing food. One thing, any option with meat in it, cannot be substituted with a vegetarian option, which we had trouble with. I ordered the chocolate waffles, which was great! (Although I wish it didn't come with chocolate syrup- very sweet dish heads up!) my sister ordered the mushroom/egg dish, super tasty! Their juices are great, and staff was friendly. Also, tables are super close together so be prepared to hear other people's conversations!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 4.5/5 rounded up! Regine Café serves up a fantastic brunch served in a quirky environment that reminds you of your weird aunt's home but with a touch of class. I went here on a Monday after my 3 hour early morning lecture because I had a long gap until my next class, and there was still a wait time. Upon being seated at the bar, I was given a sample shot of one of their smoothies and loved how it tasted. I then ordered the blackberry grapefruit smoothie and the Champi - their version of eggs Benedict on bread with Le Soucier cheese and mushrooms and potatoes and fruit on the side. The blackberry grapefruit smoothie tasted fresh with the flavor of each ingredient coming through, and I liked how they focused on the natural sweetness of the fruits themselves rather than adding lots of sugar. The Champi was also great and I loved how the bite of the cheese contrasted with the silky smooth poached eggs; in addition, the mushrooms were so flavorful and juicy and there were lots of it, which I loved. The only part I didn't really care for much were the potatoes as I'm not quite sure what they were trying to do with them. It just seemed like an overall dryer version of mashed potatoes which was slightly underwhelming, but everything else (including the fruit) made up for it. By the time I was finished, I was positively stuffed and barely able to walk as the food coma was way too real haha.  I will be back sometime because I noticed that they have a duck confit omelette, and good omelettes and duck meat are two of my favorite things. Unfortunately, my budget wasn't that accommodating that day and I had already saved up money to go there in the first place as it is on the slightly more expensive side when it comes to brunch restaurants. The pastries also look amazing, but knowing how much food they give you, I might have to make two more trips to try everything I want to try. It's never a bad thing though!"}
{"text":"Nice place , retro modern look. We had to wait about 15 minutes outside for a table , pretty quick and we had heaters to warm us up. Very nice staff, amazing service. I took the Champi breakfast . It was tasty not your regular boring breakfast . Original and refreshing. Great latte but too small. Not enough fruits in the breakfast plate. Beside that all was perfect! I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I would say this was the best meal I had in Montreal. Excellent use of wild mushrooms and such good breads. Sauces were on point for their inspiration of the day (savory pop tart) and such good potatoes. Ugh, everything was delightful and I wish I had more. Plus, such a nice place! Like my grandma's dining room, if I was a WASP."}
{"text":"If you do one brunch in Montreal... it better be this one. It was fantastic! I came with a group of 5 on a Friday at 10:30. We had a reservation. When we got to the restaurant there was a massive line out front (and it was raining!). We went right to the front and let them know we had a reservation and we were seated immediately.  We ordered their donuts of the day-- they were amazing. A super light and fluffy almost cronut texture with a white chocolate ganache topping and a rhubarb jam for dipping... UM HELLO?! For our main meals 2 of us ordered the Sandwhich, 1 ordered the Dore, and 2 ordered the Chic Croissant. The meals are massive, so come hungry. Cooked to perfection.  Service was quick and kind.   I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Délicieux ! La bouffe et le décor sont impeccables ! Le seul bémol est la longue file d'attente à l'extérieur, et ce, pratiquement tous les jours, je n'ai pas le courage d'attendre aussi longtemps!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. When visiting Montreal, do yourself a favor and eat here. You will thank yourself!! Happy eating!"}
{"text":"A must go in Montreal delicious food! Exellent customer service I wish I had one in Miami!!"}
{"text":"Parfait pour déjeuner malgré quelques lacunes. Le service client est au top je dois l'admettre. Côté nourriture  j'ai pas trop aimé le gros morceau de pain dans mon assiette du pain baguette me suffit j'avais l'impression d'avoir que du pain dans mon assiette. Pâtisserie au chocolat était trop sucré (genre de brownies). Les prix sont un peu trop chère aussi."}
{"text":"All three stars go to the food and that's really about it.  The restaurant is warm as heck and I was sweating while eating.  The service is slow and inattentive.  Would I go back, though?  Yeah, I would.  Their bad marks don't outweigh the good.  First, the food.  Wow, just awesomeness all around.  I got the Mish Mash (omelet) of the Day and it was fantastic.  My wife got the Chic Croissant.  Both were excellent.  I like how they give you all these little side complementary items to your dish.  They give you some sliced fruit, some baked beans, some freshly mashed potato, and some great toasted baguette depending upon what you ordered.  We also got the yogurt on the side which is done as a creme brulee.  The food makes me want to try the rest of their menu out.  Second, the restaurant is just so freaking warm.  I don't know how to explain it except that no A/C exists in the damn place.  I don't know.  Maybe it's just me, but I felt uncomfortable.  But, that's just a testament to the food.  Good enough to make me forget about the sweating.  Third, the service was ite.  I mean, when they spoke to us, they were friendly and all that, but it took long as heck to get to us and at various points during my meal, I just felt like server upon server was going by us, but not really paying attention to us.    Also, while we were seated at the bar, another pair received some complimentary samples of some drink that we were not privy, too.  Other then the fact that they were two attractive girls, I imagine it to be poor taste to give complimentary anything to someone sitting at the bar without also sharing that with the others who are in full view of said gift and are actually sitting adjacent to the recipients.  Whining about nothing?  Maybe.  But, just see how you feel in a similar spot.  I don't know.  Couldn't help but feel, \"Hey, what about us?\"  All in all, great food, service department/AC needs some tweaking.  Would come back again though."}
{"text":"Bon, mais pas impressionne! Un peu cher pour un dejeuner..."}
{"text":"Friendly staff delicious food. Amazing brunch! They even have several gluten free options."}
{"text":"You know it must good when it's in a remote area but still have ppl waiting in line at 11am of a Monday morning....we waited for about 20 minutes before we were seated, but it was worth it. We had a hard time on deciding what to order, and finally landed on the Pain Perdu (French toast with almonds and prunes compote) and Mish Mash (omelette of the day, in a pan), both were very good, fresh ingredients cooked just right. Though the coffee and grapefruit juice could be skipped, they were just so-so. Another must-try specialty is the Yogourt brule, it has the texture of a Creme brulee, but without the sweetness and calories, very creative dish."}
{"text":"Attendez vous à au moins 1:00 heure d'attente un dimanche matin mais l'expérience en vaut l'attente!"}
{"text":"Best brunch in Montreal! Omg this French joint is outstanding and I feel like I'm in Europe. I am from NY and brunch has never tasted this good."}
{"text":"J'ai entendu parlé de Régine Café par une amie québécoise. Elle m'a dit : \"si tu as aimé prendre un déjeuner à ce restau ABC, tu dois aller chez Régine, c'est la meilleure place pour les déjeuners !\" J'ai pas fais ma difficile, avec une propagande pareille, je n'avais qu'une envie, c'est d'aller goûter ! Nous voilà avec mon copain, un dimanche matin, bravant le froid pour rejoindre le si convoîter Régine Café. Une demi-heure de file, mais agrémentée de douceurs à grignoter apportées par un serveur. On entre, on s'installe au bar, une serveuse très agréable nous explique les différents choix et notre commande est lancée. Un quart d'heure après, je vois deux grosses planches arriver vers nous, c'est ce qu'on a commandé, mais on ne s'attendait pas à autant ! C'est beau, c'est bon, on se régale du début à la fin, et on oublie aussitôt la file qu'on a fait dans le froid glacial. On ressort le bide complètement plein, et heureux d'avoir si bien mangé ! Je recommande à 100% !"}
{"text":"So worth the wait, even though we came at 9:30 we were seated within 25 minutes. The prices justify the thought and artistry of the meals. I wouldn't go on about what I had since all items are worth trying."}
{"text":"The best brunch by far. Executed to perfection. The food looks and tastes better than the picture, and that says a lot. Something different that no one else is doing, a must try for the breakfast lovers. Quality."}
{"text":"We heard from friends that this place was amazing so we had to try it while in Montreal. The food was amazing to say the least and 100% worth the long wait for a table. We started with some delicious doughnuts and had the French toast with pulled ham and eggs and the special waffles with blueberries and poached apricot which was amazing. Even sitting at the bar the service was excellent. We ended up spending quite a lot for brunch ($78 with tip) but you could easily only spend $35 for two and still have an excellent meal."}
{"text":"Tout a déjà été dit sur Régine, ses brunchs succulents, son service impeccable, et tout est vrai. Une vraie belle place qui vaut le détour, sans hésiter"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service...a must when visiting Montreal. Waiter Jeremy also very prompt in realizing that we did not speak French and he shifted to English language very easily. Great place"}
{"text":"J'ai adoré brancher au Régine. Le menu est diversifié et propose un éventail de déjeunés créatifs. Vraiment, le choix est plutôt difficile à faire tant on veut tout goûter. Je me suis rabattu sur l'oeuf poché frit avec de la chaire de saucisse et c'était trop trop délicieux. La prochaine fois que j'y vais il faut absolument que je goûte au nutella maison qui est apparemment divin!"}
{"text":"I had read a zillion reviews for this place and was both interested in the dreamy descriptions of the food, and skeptical. I'm not interested in waiting in lines so I figured I'd probably just never try this much hyped brunch joint, but then we were in the area on a Tuesday and the line was short and my hot date was willing so we put our names down. We only waited 10 minutes and the service was prompt, professional and kind. We were seated in a kind of shitty corner table, almost in the alley between the two dining rooms, and the decor was bumming us out - a little frilly and overdone for my taste - and the prices were high for breakfast and not a lot of vegetarian options, so we were working hard to keep our spirits up until the food came. And then everything was ok.   The homemade brioche with banana butter was melt-in-my-mouth glorious. The smoked trout on corn waffles with light fresh salsa and ciboulette cream was light but filling and incredibly delicious and the coffee was great. I felt great after I ate it like you only do with exceptional food and ingredients. Even my highly dubious vegetarian date loved it all in spite of himself.   By the time we left the line was around the corner so I doubt I'll be back in a hurry but the meal was a treat and I'm super glad I got to try it."}
{"text":"Excellent service, the food was awesome and we were not rushed to leave as soon as we finished our meal. Plenty of coffee and discussions to keep us happy ;)"}
{"text":"Best place we ate in Montreal!!  Everything was amazing but the french toast is out of this world!!!"}
{"text":"This place is super chic. Love their baroque decor. It looked fantastic. Definitely one of the prettiest restaurants that I have been to.  However, the place was really crowded, we were sitting really close to the other tables.  Their food is really good, I got the corn waffle with salmon. And my boyfriend got the classic breakfast with eggs and meat and stuffs. The corn waffle was really special, it got a nice balance. But their creme-brûlée style yogurt did not work for me. Too sweet!"}
{"text":"J'ai testé les gaufres aux saumon fumés et les scones àux sirop d'érables c est une tuerie"}
{"text":"On a rainy April day I decided to invite 3 members of my family for a brunch for their B-days, they picked Regine. We got there & waited in line for about half an hour.  It started to rain & the staff came out with umbrellas while we were waiting. When our table was ready,  we got in the restaurant & to my surprise  it felt like I was in Paris at a cafe bistro with vintage decor.  The staff had a parisian accent. We chose different dishes  (refer to the pics) everything was delicious & colorful.  I tasted each dish & was satisfied with the marriage of flavors of the various dishes. The one I  wasn't to impressed with was my dish. I was expecting to live an experience like the other dishes I tasted but was disappointed.  I found the Cheddar lacked flavors with the mango chutney & did not have enough caramelized onions. The rest were all great dishes with exciting flavors. I definitely invite you to come & taste the food at Regine, you will love the place & the staff. The food is just different & overall EXCELLENT! Hope to see you there because I will surely go back"}
{"text":"5étoiles pour le décor, j'adore, très trendy, chic, simple... Tout ce qui est IN, quoi... Pour ce qui est du menu il est très original mais pas très élaboré... Disons que j'aime avoir beaucoup de choix. Nous sommes loin de deux, bacons et patates. J'ai essayé le croissant avec uf brouillé, jambon effiloché, vieux cheddar et sauce aux épinards, servi avec quelques fruits et pommes de terre en purée. C'était bon, mais rien d'extra ordinaire. J'ai pris une de leur fameuse brioche pour apporter. J'ai bien hâte de l'essayer. Le service est très sympa."}
{"text":"Meilleur brunch en ville! Le décor, le service, le menu, le goût, les quantités, tout est parfait. Je suis ravie d'avoir découvert ce restaurant que j'affectionne maintenant au plus haut point. Les plats sont différents de ce que l'on retrouve dans les restaurants de déjeuner habituellement.  Personnellement, j'adore le gruau au lait de coco et le repas sucré-salé J'ai goûté plusieurs de leurs plats et tout est fantastique."}
{"text":"I cannot get enough of this restaurant! I want to personally try everything on this menu!!! Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day so I don't fool around when it comes to breakfast. I'm at the breakfast place no later than 9:30 a.m. to guarantee me a seat. Cause when I go out for breakfast, I always got my hungry \"on\" and expecting to eat NOW--not after waiting in a line for 45 minutes. So if you're like me, please show up to Régine Cafe before 9:45 a.m. if you want to be seated right away.    First thing you notice is that the staff are fantastic and the decor is unique and inviting! The staff are warm, friendly, courteous, just really adds to the experience when you have excellent service. They're all dressed so nicely, I especially like seeing one guy wear a wooden bowtie--now if that doesn't take it up a notch, I don't know what does!   Then, they always bring you fresh fruit shooters along with a bottle of water.  Then they go over the special of the day.    Now for the food, here's a detailed review of the plates I've tasted so you can decide if you want it. Just a heads up--there is no dish that I didn't love.   CHAMPI--savory saucy mushrooms over hearty bread with cheese and poached eggs. It's eaten with a toothed knife. Satisfying, savory and good to the last bite.  DORÉ--for the sweet tooth in you.  The plate is simple and delicious  GAUFRÉ--this is my FAVORITE dish so far!  It's a perfect blend of delicately sweet and savory.  The corn waffle brings sweetness to the dish, the gravlax with the salty, the cream cheese with the richness and the tomato salsa and pickled onions bring the punch!    CHOCOLAT--another sweet breakfast but for chocolate lovers.  The candied oranges help lighten the flavor and you can't help but wonder how this is even legal to eat for breakfast :D  Scotch Egg--this was the only thing that I wasn't a fan of because the meat was a bit spicy.  Duck sausage--surprisingly not fatty! So go ahead and add it as a protein side to your dish!  Vanilla white chocolate drink--perfect to complement a savory breakfast.  It's fairly light.  Salty dark chocolate milk--just for those not expecting it, the flavor is predominantly salty dark chocolate.  You won't find the usual sweetness that you may expect.  Nice to complement a sweet breakfast.   Overall, I'm in love with this breakfast place and will 100% go back again...and again...and again!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite breakfast/brunch places that I've ever had! Our friends had raved about this place and I can totally see why. Please open one up in Toronto!   Pros: - Food: The food here is so good! Everything was made fresh and portions were huge! You will definitely not leave here hungry! I think for the price, it is well worth your money for the experience and food quality you get.  - Decor: The decor of the restaurant is so cute. You can see everyone just taking pictures all the time. Very modern!  - Service: Our server was great, very nice and helped us pick what we wanted to get. All of our food came out at the same time.   Cons: - Line ups: If you are going for breakfast, be prepared to leave earlier to stand in line. When our group went, the line up was around the corner. Fortunately, the servers came out with small snacks and flavoured water for the people waiting in line.  - Parking: Unfortunately, no parking for this restaurant. We had to park on the street and walk to the restaurant.   Foods/Drinks I like: - Gros Jambon - Un Peu De Tout - Champi with Scotch Egg"}
{"text":"I was visiting in Montreal and I was looking for a place to go for a late lunch on a Tuesday near Beaubien. My cousins recommended I try this place which is always always packed as they told me. We took a chance since they assured me that the food would totally worth it!  I tried the grilled cheese with duck confit as an extra. It was delicious but way overpriced. $15 for a grilled cheese and $5 extra did the duct confit. It included a light green salad and a mango chutney. It was good but didn't worth the price.  My cousins had the brioche which was delicious and also café latte in a bowl.  I had the special of ty day cocktail which was carrot, ginger and I forget but it was tasty and light.  The restaurant setting is great, very comfy with nice stylish chairs and also great service."}
{"text":"J'ai A-DO-RÉ! Il se classe parmi mes tops restaurants de brunch! Vraiment tout était parfait! L'ambiance est wow, le restau est super beau (très instagrammable) et les plats sont tout simplement divins! C'est sur que c'est plus cher qu'à ta pataterie du coin qui sert des déjeuners full gras à 4,50$, mais les prix respectent la qualité des aliments amplement!  Bref, amateurs de brunch succulent, je vous le conseille à 100% !! J'ai mangé l'assiette sucré salé et mon copain a pris l'assiette de croquette de saumon et les deux plats étaient sensass!!   Nous y retourner pour sur !"}
{"text":"A must visit if in or anywhere near Montreal.  This place easily became our all time favorite breakfast/brunch place after putting out amazing dishes. The french toast with strawberries and mascarpone was mind blowing and the omelette we also got was perfect.  Our meal couldn't have been better. The waitress was extremely kind and helpful while the restaurant itself is designed perfectly.  I'd give this place a higher rating if I could."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot. I love the overall vibe and atmosphere, as well as the design layout. Good coffee. Good food. Extremely generous portions, to the point where I was actually shocked. They have a great selection of pastries to choose from as well. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The place fills up really fast and there will be a line outside. Make sure you come here at a good time."}
{"text":"Food: this place is testing your patience because the line up can be really really long but it's worth the wait!  We had 2 dishes: the sucré salé and Champi. Both choice were excellent but the hightlight is the Sucré salé. A perfect balance of sweet side with a thick, crispy outside and moist inside, french toasts with a marvelous sugar fudge sauce ( I'm still thinking about it) and salty side with another french toast with a egg and pulled ham. The combination of everything the salty with the sugar fudge sauce is just damn gooood!  Service: friendly and quick  Ambiance: mix crowd. the decoration is nice with velvet chairs and mix of square and round tables.  Price: reasonable for a fancy breakfast   Conclusion: I'm coming back"}
{"text":"Loved the entire experience. I sat by the bar and got wonderful tips for which food to order by the male server. The food and service was great; Friendly staff and good service which I have to say overall is hard to find in Montreal ( from where I went as a vacationer )  My favorite part of my breakfast was the scotch egg , I have never had it before and it simply made me smile . I wish I could get it FedEx to NYC."}
{"text":"Really good brunch...One of the best I've tried in montreal.  Food is good and plating looks amazing too.  Beware of the long wait."}
{"text":"L'endroit déjeuner et brunch le plus \"girly\" cool de la ville de Montréal.  Arrivez tôt, il y a de longues files d'attentes le week-end.  Déco éclectique et chaleureuse.  Nutella maison"}
{"text":"Excellent et à la hauteur de sa réputation ! On s'est régalés avec le scottish egg, menu champi et le gros jambon. Nos voisins avaient pris des plats sucrés avec de la brioche dorée qui avaient l'air incroyables ! La prochaine fois, je prends ça ! Petit bémol sur le chaï latte mais il n'était pas à la carte donc rien à dire."}
{"text":"Super découverte, ambiance super sympa, service impecable et rapide. Le champi etait juste incroyable! Servi avec l'uf écossais ! J ai adorer!"}
{"text":"luv it i will be coming back here over and over again, the staff was just wow, after a 1 hr   wait wich was well worth it, we stood in the rain and one of the staff members came out to offer the ppl in line umbrellas and sample cinnamon brioche and red velvet cake, talk about great costumer service, and the food..fresh tasty everything especialy the cretons i luv, thnk you regine cafe for coming to my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"If only there wasn't a massive lineup here on weekends I think I'd be here every week... Yes, it's THAT good!  Not your typical brunch place with eggs any style. Every item on the menu is original, resulting in a complete twist on classic items.   We had the grilled cheese on homemade pistachio bread, you could really taste the pistachios with every bite. As well as the sweet and salty, which consisted of homemade thick French toast topped with pulled ham and an egg served along with melted sucre a la creme. Both were delicious, plate licking good (which I did do, but with a spoon!)  Will definitely be back!  If you are free during a weekday, ever better! As they take reservations :)"}
{"text":"superbe endroit, bonne bouffe courtois souriant ,tassé un peu mais il y as une raison y en as du monde dois je te dire pourquoi ....c'est excellent c'est simple.... oui on attend ça vaux la peine d attendre c'est frais ,les assiettes ouffff y en as dans tu prends ce que tu veux tu seras pas déçu vas y a plusieurs tu seras choyé et tu t amuseras atmosphère excellente dois je en dire plus vasssssss yyyyyyyy les yeux fermée"}
{"text":"Best brunch in Montreal hand down ! Great quantity/price ratio ! You leave this place full and happy ! I try not to take the tower \"Un peu de tout\" each time but it is so good !! I tried also the Champi, so good and with a great earthy taste If you go during the week I suguess you to take a reservation, there will be no wait and during the week-end for sure there will be a line but I never waited more than 30 minutes and the staff is always nice and calm with a great smile :)"}
{"text":"I live 40 minutes away from this place and even during the coldest time, I am willing to drive all the way there and wait outside; although during summer is much more pleasant and better.  Service: Excellent, top notch and never have I been disappointed. You are waiting outside and the staff are kind enough to offer sample bites of their cinnamon bun. It surely doesn't cost them much, but a little token of appreciation is definitely noticed and makes it much more pleasant to wait.   Although the line can be very long, you never feel rushed while eating. They offer you a healthy shot of juice and often come back to ask you if everything is perfect.  Food:   Grilled cheese with duck confit. Portion is big, meal is very heavy but worth it. YUM!  The Champi is also delicious with the Scotched egg.  The spicy hot chocolate is a must- definitely has an extra kick. creamy, enough to share.    This is my number one place to go for brunch."}
{"text":"Gourmet at its best. Was really impressed with the friendly, charming service and the food was gourmet-style. I ordered the chef's inspiration of the day: One egg sunny-side up on a bed of cheese, tomato on a flaky pastry-type bread with mashed potato on the side, salad, and roasted corn on the cob. Very original. Very creative. Very affordable for the great quality.  Also, would recommend that you go as early as possible or have a reservation. I arrived at about 9:15 a.m. and we waited for a free table for two for 10 minutes. I heard the line-ups get long after 10:00 am but even at 9:00 am, the place was packed."}
{"text":"Un ami m'a déjà dit un jour : \"quand tu ne connais pas le quartier, va manger là où il y a du monde.\"   La file est longue chez Régine et ils ont raisons d'être patients.  La bouffe est vraiment bonne et créative. L'Imagination des chefs nous ouvre l'appétit simplement en regardant le menu. Chez Régine rien n'est fait comme ailleurs: Du Grills cheese pour le déjeuné ou gravelax de truite sur gaufres. Un délice original.  Le service est très rapide, amusant et sympathique.  Une combinaison des forces d'une équipe merveilleuse. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Great choice, great food. Enjoy the unique experience and quality food. If you like brunch it is a must on your Montréal list. (Always a lineup though)"}
{"text":"Que vous préfériez le sucré ou le salé, il y en a pour tous les goûts ! Régine Café est un endroit sympa pour bruncher entre amis : cadre mignon, personnel agréable qui vous laisse prendre votre temps, assiettes copieuses, large choix de plats, de pâtisseries et de boissons...  J'ai pour ma part goûté le \"Sandwich\" avec de la foccacia, du chorizo, des tomates confites et des oeufs brouillés. Attention à ceux qui n'aiment pas l'anis (mon cas) ! Mais objectivement, c'était plutôt bon. J'ai accompagné mon plat d'un café latte (très crémeux), et d'une brioche à la cannelle (un peu sèche à mon goût).  Les petits plus :  - On vous accueille avec un petit \"shot\" de jus de fruits frais pressés, très rafraîchissant. - Il y a un peu de monde le week-end, mais de l'eau fruitée est disponible en libre-service à l'extérieur : de quoi vous hydrater lorsque vous patienter dehors pour être assis !"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to write a review for this place, i went a few years back and I have only been once. The cafe had some nice decor and charming couches also, not very comfy but they looked nice. We took a few dishes. I opted for the tradition breakfast , 2 eggs with ham. Wasn't a fan of the ham at all, different from what I usually take.  The bill came and it was 50+dollars... for 2 people. Much more then every breakfast/brunch spot I have been too. I see a lot of people scored this 4-5stars...I personally feel there's lot of hype for this place but IMO it's nothing to brag about.    Just a tip: you pay for each coffee you have. No refills"}
{"text":"Wow, parfait mélange d'une belle présentation et d'un bon gout des aliments. Chapeau aux cuisiniers/chefs pour ce bon déjeuner ! Le service est correct, mais c'est comprenable puisque le restaurant est bombé de monde et que la file d'attente à l'extérieur reste de la même longueur à journée longue! Sa vaut le déplacement et l'attente"}
{"text":"If you're going to Régine Café for brunch, you're winning in every way. I have to be upfront here, my only disappointment about Régine was its long wait outside in freezing weather. However, I knew the wait is well worth it when the waiters and waitresses brought small bites and hot cups of tea to for the people standing outside to make them feel warm!   Régine Café has an exquisite menu filled with dishes that have carefully selected ingredients of the highest quality. Whether you're into meat and protein, a breakfasty dish, or a healthy dish that has yogurt and fruits in it, you won't be disappointed. Apart from the deliciousness, there is a lot of details in the presentation of plates that makes every plate a work of art! Drinks, juices, and coffees are all very well made as well. If you're not from Canada, like me, try their ultra thick french toasts with Quebec maple syrup as a side.   The staff at Régine Café are well-trained ladies and gentlemen who go above and beyond for their costumers. There is a genuine smile on everyone's face that made my experience one that I won't forget."}
{"text":"Now one of my favorite brunch places in Montreal. I've been here twice for brunch on a Sunday and a Monday on two separate occasions. The restaurant has been busy both times. One thing to note is they don't do reservations on weekends, so you'll have to patiently wait on line.   I've tried the coffee with condensed milk and the spiced hot chocolate which both are great in their own way. The spiced hot chocolate is separated its milk and chocolate concoction for you to combine in a cup to your liking. It is served along with a mini whisk and cinnamon stick. The coffee with condensed milk has a cloud of whipped cream and coffee bean shaped chocolates on top. The condensed milk adds a sweet silkiness to the coffee.  They have many options to choose from what to eat. From savory dishes to sweet. The two items I tried were the grilled cheese and the chic croissant. The chic croissant is a stacked croissant sandwich with scrambled eggs, cheddar, pulled ham and a creamy spinach sauce. The flakiness of the croissant pairs well with the rest of the combination. I really enjoyed the grilled cheese since I'm a sucker for duck confit. The bread was very unique with walnuts and pistachios. What's really great is they serve the dishes with a side of fresh fruit to refresh your palate from all the good food you enjoyed.  Service was really good as well as the wait staff is very attentive to make sure their customers are taken care of."}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere! The brioche buns is amazing but you have to go early to get some, they only make a few and when it's out, it out! Sad but I'll keep trying to get my hands on those buns! One day."}
{"text":"Régine Café un des endroits dont on parle le plus sur les réseaux sociaux pour ce qui est du brunch. Mes attentes étaient vraiment élevées, peut être même trop elevées. Nous sommes arrivées vers 10h un peu avant le rush hour et les line up. Nous avons eu une belle table près de la fenêtre. J'aime la décoration, elle est colorée, vive, des chaises en velours, c'est réconfortant, on se sent comme dans une maison de poupées! Le service est agréable, tout en sourire, ça fait du bien. Par contre, je dois avouer à la lecture du menu qu'il n'y a pas assez d'options pour les dents sucrées, beaucoup trop de salé à mon goût. Nous avons donc pris le fameux plateau de viennoiseries. Magnifique! On y retrouve leur brioche à la cannelle super savoureuse et plein d'autres bouchées. Nous l'avons séparé à trois en prenant chacun 1 extra."}
{"text":"Wonderful. Couldn't ask for more, Good was excellent, the atmosphere was chill. When I come back to Montreal I will definitely come back to the Régine Cafe."}
{"text":"We went here during our weekend stay in Montreal for my cousins Bach party. The service was amazing. We saw a good google review and decided to pop by around lunch with 9, yes 9, ladies. They were no inconvenienced at all. In fact they had mint grapefruit infused water for those waiting. We waited a total of 15 minutes tops before we were seated in their cute French bistro basket atmosphere. Their food was well priced, we sampled multiple menu items and the presentation was something out of this world. Charming and perfect. They also had 2 for 1 mimosas. Cheers to a great cafe and thanks from my party and I !"}
{"text":"I happen to live near this place and I only tried it for the first time 1 month ago. There is a wait time about 20-30 minutes usually. Cute decor feels retro. They offer free \"hot chocolate\" type shots to start which is nice. I ordered their yogurt and my husband has the grilled cheese with duck. I love my plate as well as their coffee. The grilled cheese lacked some cheese and only had duck in the middle and a small portion. Id go back to try different things. The staff is friendly. Still a decent breakfast place compared to a lot"}
{"text":"Went once, won't ever go again, food has no taste. Don't waste your time in the long line up. I understand the experience is built for people who don't mind bad food, and I'm not the target market. I believe that customers are entitled to the best ingredients the market has to offer for the price.  Waitress didn't bother asking if food was good, and I bet the whole team knows what they are serving. If you work there, this review should be a wake-up call."}
{"text":"I was visiting Montreal for 3 days and wanted to eat somewhere good. After seeing all the great reviews here on Yelp, I decided to come visit on a Saturday afternoon. It was pretty busy and I had to wait 30 min before being seated but it was completely worth it. The decoration was fancy/elegant and the service was amazing! The food was delicious. I ordered the sandwich with eggs, chorizo, avocado, and cherry tomatoes which left me full for half of the day. I also liked the plate with french toast, pulled ham, and egg and cream fudge. The side dip for the french toast tasted like caramel - yumm! This would totally be my go-to fancy brunch place if I lived in the area!"}
{"text":"I was quite eager to try this place after having heard many good things about it and was quite pleased when it lived up to my expectations.  There can be a line-up to get a table but it is no better or no worse than any other good brunch place in Montreal.  Once inside the decor is eclectic yet welcoming and the service is fast and friendly.    They started us off with a shot of pineapple juice and ginger.  The ginger added a nice touch to the juice and they must have made the pineapple juice there because there was plenty of chunks of fruit in it.  While I only had a glass of grapefruit juice their hot drinks looked very tempting!  The hot chocolate was served with what looked like homemade marshmallows and it made me regret not ordering one even though I wasn't in the mood for it.  I ordered Le Champi which consisted of 2 poached eggs served on top of Mamirolle on toast with red pepper compote and mushrooms.  The eggs were slightly overcooked however everything else made up for that.  The bread was of high quality and the cheese added some really nice flavour without overpowering everything.  I also tried some of my friend's cinnamon brioche which was divine.  Pricewise it is on par with other brunch places in the city.  I'd definitely go back to this place as I was quite satisfied.  Next time though I think I'd have to try their pastries which all looked decadent."}
{"text":"In this case I wasn't really expecting to like it all that much. I'm not even a fan of brunch, but I went for a friend's birthday and it was actually so delicious. I ordered savoury and shared a dessert, they were both pretty solid. The only thing annoying was the line-up, I don't like waiting in line so I usually just don't even bother, but the fact that it was my friend's thing made me stay, and I'm glad I did!"}
{"text":"J'adore cet endroit! La bouffe est super bonne et l'ambiance très agréable! Et que dire de la décoration, à la fois colorée, éclectique et tellement chaleureuse!  Ce matin, je me régalée du déjeuner \"Gaufré\", des gaufres de maïs avec gravlax de truite, crème ciboulette, tomates cerises et roquette. Délicieux! Les assiettes sont énormes, mais c'était tellement bon que j'ai tout dévoré! Mon capuccino était aussi parfait. En semaine, pas de problème à se trouver une table, on peut même réserver! Toutefois, si vous y allez la fin de semaine, attendez-vous à faire la ligne parce que c'est toujours plein et qu'on ne peut pas faire de réservations. Niveau prix, les déjeuners sont aux alentours de 15-18$ et ils en veulent largement le prix. Le capuccino est autour de 3,50$. Le personnel a été très serviable et le service était très bien. Je n'ai absolument rien à redire sur cet endroit, mis à part le fait que j'aurais le goût de prendre congé en semaine pour aller déguster un de leurs plats!!!   Update: le \"doré\", pain doré avec crème de fromage de chèvre, pacanes caramélisées et poire pochée est vraiment décadent (et c'est une portion ÉNORME!!), mais il est loin de battre le \"gaufré\" ou le grilled cheese (canard confit, fromage de l'île aux grues, chutney)."}
{"text":"This was a gem to find in Montreal. I rarely have proper brunch in Toronto and was very excited to try this one. It was very cold in the morning and we waited in line for 20-30 min. The cafe provides small samples and tea for customers waiting in line. This was a very nice gesture. When we finally got seated, I ordered a dark hot chocolate and the special.   The dark chocolate was DIY, you pour the dark chocolate and milk together. Then, I whisked it all together. It came with a marshmallow. It was very delicious. The dark hot chocolate was 72% I believe and it was not overly bitter. The marshmallow was very good.   The daily special I ordered was a piece of sourdough (I think) with scrambled eggs, avocado, chorizo, and a lot of leafy greens. I was starving and first impression was that it was beautifully set. The eggs was very fluffy and I can tell that they used milk (I think). I wish that the food was hotter. It was warm and got cold fast. I might just eat slow. It was a huge portion as well so I was stuffed by the end of it.   I would come back to the place again to try the french toast and other scrumptious goods on the menu."}
{"text":"Waited an hour outside the café because it was VERY POPULAR! The café closes at They served us cinnamon roll at some point and we were quite happy about it. Just to give you an idea, the restaurant closes at 3PM and there is still a lineup at 2:30PM. The interior decor of the restaurant is really chic and the atmosphere is great and relaxing. I ordered Champi upon my cousin's recommendation and matcha latte because I love matcha, and turned out that both were simply wow! Wow! And WOW! It was more than satisfaction after one hour of wait in the cold, and it was really worth it! Their lemon cake and smoothies look really good, I should try them the next time that I come by. In conclusion, this is for sure not my last visit to Régine!"}
{"text":"A great place for brunch!!  I like the decoration inside. The volume is huuuuuge! The taste is goooood!  People line up event in winter...so...if you want to go there Mon-Fri, it would be better to make a reservation. If you want to go there at the weekend, good luck! Because the restaurant don't take reservation for the weekend."}
{"text":"Ok, la voici : LA meilleure place de brunch de Montreal !  Alors oui, l'attente est parfois longue, et ce n'est pas à coté du métro, mais vraiment, une fois installés, ce sera vite oublié. Le service est très rapide, l'équipe est souriante et les plats divins... un amour cette Régine !  J'ai jeté mon dévolu sur le chic croissant, après avoir essayé plusieurs plats tout aussi délicieux les uns que les autres. Les assiettes sont toujours copieuses, les desserts excellents (je vous recommande le yaourt brulé et les brioches) et en attendant vos plats vous aurez même le plaisir de vous faire offrir un shoot de smoothie du jour.   Longue vie à Régine !"}
{"text":"If you do have a lot of time to wait in line (it could be more than an hour) then it is a nice place to check in to for brunch.  The service is great, the friendly staff will take care of the crowd outside by giving away some brioche and warm tea. Once you do get inside, you're welcomed by a small juice shooter and introduced to daily specialties.  The decor is nice and it is more than just a breakfast place I'd say. The food is great too, a little bit too salty for my taste, but very generous on portions. Yes, I'd come there again maybe in summer and bit earlier so I don't have to wait so long in line."}
{"text":"Everything here is original and delicious. The decor is charming and the service is very good.  Their specialty breakfasts are actually better than their traditional breakfast items. They also make delicious high quality baked goods.  The yogurt crème brûlée is an exceptional side to your breakfast... A must try!    Don't go at peak hours unless you are prepared to wait in a long lineup."}
{"text":"Ce périple canadien commence sur les chapeaux de roues! D'emblée la barre est mise très haute.   Régine Café est un peu excentré et l'entrée ne sera autorisé qu'après 20 minutes d'attente mais ces quelques désagréments sont très vite oubliés.   On vous sert un shot de jus de fruits frais maison en guise de mise en bouche ainsi que de l'eau. Une carte simple mais complète sert également de set de table. On décide de partager un grilled cheese avec canard confit ainsi qu'une tartine inspiration du jour, remplie de bonnes choses. Pour attendre on commandera aussi deux mimosa.   10 minutes plus tard nous sommes déjà servi et c'est là que je comprends pourquoi cet endroit tourne aussi bien. Les odeurs se mélangent et les couleurs sont superbes. Le canard fond dans la bouche et je manque de dévorer toute la tartine alors que nous sommes deux à devoir la partager...   Pour bien clôturer et même si on avait plus vraiment faim, on commande un yoghourt brûlé, interprétation maison de la crème brûlée, ainsi qu'un roulé à la cannelle. Succulent!"}
{"text":"C'est beau, c'est bon ! Une de mes meilleures places pour bruncher ! Même les 50 min d'attente dans le froid n'ont pas entaché ce dejeuner, c'est dire ! Les assiettes sont belles, les aliments de qualité sont très bien travaillés. J'y retournerai avec plaisir pour tester la carte du printemps."}
{"text":"Its a cool experience..very nice decor.crowded.everything looks great to the eye...but my taste buds weren't very satisfied.i would probably still try it again just to make sure.."}
{"text":"Great place and reasonably priced for Brunch. Ordered the champi, which is great even if you're vegetarian. Came with hash brown, eggs, mushrooms and toast with fruit on the side. The mimosas was also good. Waited 45 mins in line outside but it was worth it (most likely because it was the weekend). Definitely an upscale and beautiful spot with plush seating."}
{"text":"A must do in Montreal, a cute restaurant with interesting decor. Starting with a refreshing beet apple cinnamon shooter, they scored high and the chocolate waffles with candied oranges dish was out of the world. My espresso drink was perhaps the only thing I ordered that had room for improvement. Scotch eggs are worth the hype!"}
{"text":"De très belles assiettes avec une touche d'originalité dans les assiettes. Par contre il faut savoir être patient pour y aller pour le brunch en groupe."}
{"text":"Depuis quelques semaines maintenant, je vois les merveilleux plats de Régine apparaître dans mon fil d'activité Facebook presqu'à chaque matin et ça me donne envie de tout lâcher et d'y aller. En fin de semaine, j'ai finalement pris le temps de m'y rendre et d'en faire l'essai moi-même, et ça valu la peine de faire l'attente dans la file qui commence presque dès l'heure ouverture les jours de fin de semaine. Ils prennent aussi des réservations par téléphone pour ceux qui savent en avance qu'ils y iront.  La déco donne l'impression d'être prise entre celle d'un resto et d'un café et l'équilibre est bien réussit. Les meubles et accessoires sont éclectiques sans être trop dépareillé pour un resto bien relaxe et plein de vie en même temps. Il y a des tables pour des petits groupes et au moins un grande table pour les grands groupes. J'aime bien l'ambiance.  Pour le café, mon bol de latte était bien corsé comme je l'aime. Les cafés Baileys de mes amis sont assez cochons mais tellement bons et beaux! Pour la bouffe, à voir les assiettes de mes amis, le 2-ufs-bacons est probablement l'assiette qui vaut le moins la peine et la plus ordinaires. Les autres choix par contre en valent la peine. Prenez du jambon effiloché si vous en avez l'option - la meilleure viande à déjeuner que j'ai goûtée depuis longtemps. Le Chic Croissant était mon choix et probablement le \" gagnant \" de notre table, mais le Doré était aussi très bon pour ceux qui ont une envie de sucré.  Le service était très bien et pas trop pressé - parfait pour le brunch du dimanche. Une personne de plus s'est présentée et l'hôtesse nous a trouvé une chaise d'extra pour qu'on n'aille pas à attendre encore plus longtemps pour une plus grande table. Le prix est un peu élevé, mais c'est des déjeuners qui sortent de l'ordinaire donc je trouve que ça en vaut la peine."}
{"text":"YOU! READING THIS! GO HERE  Where else can you get STUPENDOUS brunch for two, for $35?   Where else can you pair incredible quality food - crème brûlée yogurt, omelet with duck confit - with incredibly generous portions?   Where else is there a line out the door willing to wait for half an hour because the staff brings out watermelon?   I'll be back to clean out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on a monday. it's a really cute small space.  Pleased that the hostess, Martine, was nice enough to accommodate us without reservations for a party of 5 and a baby in a stroller.  Oddly, there were some restaurants during our trip to montreal that were surprised about bringing a stroller in the establishment (ex:  The Lapin hostess told us to leave the baby in his stroller outside. what?! So of course we didn't dine there).  I can understand in a way why they would because of the small space and possibility of blocking the walkways, but just be aware if you're planning on visiting montreal with a baby.  The food was great!  The price was decent for the big serving.  Presentation was really cute as well.  Our server, Veronique, was friendly and attentive.  She asked right away whether we spoke french or english, and that was really appreciated, and she did a great job explaining the menu to us.  There was a complimentary shot-size of beet/apple juice, which was refrehing.  I ordered the homemade iced tea and asked it to be sweetened.  It had pom arils and was also refreshing.  I also ordered the mish mash bc the omelet of the day had salmon.  I wished there was more salmon, but it was filling.  It was served with 2 crostinis, fruit bowl, and one of the best mashed potatoes ever (chunky and perfectly cooked and seasoned to my taste).  I tried a friend's duck confit grilled cheese, which I highly recommend.  My other friend had the champi with the scotch egg.  the scotch egg was perfect!  If you don't like mushrooms though, you might be overwhelmed by the hefty amount.  I like them personally.  The french toast was on point.  I might be wrong, but the bread they used looked like brioche.  It was thick and dense and perfect with the thick sugary sauce served with it.  I also tried a friend's creme brûlée yogurt.  It's a good idea, but it's basically yogurt with sugar that was brûléed on top.  Overall, I recommend this place.  For a monday brunch, it was a busy place and from the time we got thre to the time we left, there was a line.  safer to have a reservation."}
{"text":"You need to make your way over to this place. I haven't enjoyed breakfast like this since my first time at Passé Composé. Be prepared to wait outside for a table, but it is well worth it! The waiters come outside to serve beverages and snacks to those in the lineup. Small touch goes a long way. The matcha latte and the spiced hot chocolate are divine! They change their menu once a season so you might not see the same items if you go in a few months. Overall, I loved the experience and the food."}
{"text":"If I could have every meal for the rest of life at Regine I would. I would I would. I only got to try their croissant sandwich but it made my Montreal trip so worth it. Also bought their homemade jam to go. It's in my fridge and every drop of it matters at this point."}
{"text":"As brunch has become more and more in vogue in Montreal, it is becoming a challenge to go to the most popular locations around the city without waiting in line somewhere. As much as I love brunch, at this time of the year, standing outside doesn't really appeal to me. If only one of the best was also open on weekdays... and located about 2 minutes from where I take some of my physio courses... oh wait... Régine Café fits that description. Awesome. This Rosemont staple has been getting rave reviews for the past few years but it never really lined up for me to visit. Well, using the excuse of my course a couple of times over the past year, I have headed over on Fridays with my classmates to indulge in some decadent brunch food as a respite from all the learning.  Régine Café has a definite retro chic look going on. Almost Alice in Wonderland-like in terms of colours and patterns. It is quaint, fun and definitely loud - both in terms of look and noise level. Even on a Friday, this isn't the place for a quiet conversation. Service was quick and efficient although at the rate people come in, they need to be.  You get a shooter of the day to start your meal every time. The first time, it was pineapple and mint. The second time, it was beet and apple. Both creative and fun ways to start the meal. They also have a number of drink options. I went with the cider both times. Very satisfying beverage for a brunch!  On my first visit, I decided to go with the Sucré Salé - homemade brioche french toast with pulled ham, aged cheddar, an egg and sucre à la crème. The title of the dish is definitely apt - a great combination of salty and sweet goodness. French toast using brioche was dense yet fluffy and had a great crust to it. The pulled ham was tender and salty. The egg and the melty cheese provided some richness and then you had the insanely sweet but oh so good sucre à la crème. I wanted a nap big time after this one so perhaps not the right choice during class but whatever, I stand by my choice.  For round 2, I started with a scone with mascarpone cream. I loved the cream but the scone was a little dry and dense to my liking. Great nutty and fruity flavour profile but a little more fluffiness would have been appreciated.  I decided after that to go with the Grilled Cheese - 2 year old Cheddar from Îles-aux-Grues with caramelised onions, walnut and pistachio bread, mango chutney and a little confit duck to top it all off. The only thing not appreciated of this plate was the mashed potatoes - too dry despite the nice rich flavour. The sandwich was outstanding - the duck was tender and fatty, the cheese was melted nicely and had a nice sharpness to it. The onions brought a touch of sweetness as well.   Régine Café definitely lived up to the hype. Excellent food, fun decor and solid service. I might be too lazy to go wait in line on a weekend but for those of you who do, don't worry - you will come out very satisfied!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"On y lunch vraiment bien et l'accueil est chaleureux. Un vaste choix de produit de qualité. La deco est vraiment belle et nous fait vite oublier la file d'attente avant d'y rentrer pour manger. Le prix n'est pas donné sans être excessif. Petite mention pour le chocolat chaud au chocolat blanc !"}
{"text":"J'avoue que terminer ce séjour vraiment trop chouette au Québec par ce brunch était vraiment une excellente idée, merci les copains !  Bon ils nous avaient prévenus que l'attente risquait d'être longue, et on était du coup moyennement chauds, mais vu tout le bien qu'ils nous avaient dit de ce brunch, à nous de faire l'effort !  Et bien je dois dire que même si l'attente a été longue (plus d'une heure), elle est passée plutôt vite à force de papoter, et nous a mis en appétit ! A un moment on nous a proposé une boisson chaude pour patienter, ce qui était vraiment sympa. Il y a aussi des braseros installés en hauteur qui réchauffent plutôt bien. Pour autant, il faisait super beau, c'était donc agréable, mais en hiver ça aurait été hors de question je crois.  Maaais la question ne s'est pas posée :) Une fois installés dans un décor gentiment baroque pas tellement à mon goût mais quand même très cosy, étude minutieuse de la carte.  L'ensemble des brunchs est autour des 15$ sans boisson. Il y a beaucoup de choix dans les assiettes salées qui donnent toutes envie. On a quasi tous pris un classique, le Gros Jambon, avec oeufs, jambon, bacon, haricots blancs sauce tomate, pommes de terre, fruits, baguette et cretons (une sorte de rillette-pâté). Ouais, rien que ça dans chaque assiette.  C'était vraiment délicieux, bien assaisonné, copieux. Le jambon est excellent, fumé mais pas sucré, les oeufs parfaits (on choisit comme on les veut : au plat, brouillés etc), les pommes de terre, la baguette bien grillée, les haricots, les cretons, les fruits, non mais vraiment tout était parfait, et je tiens à le dire, pas excessivement gras ! Ton ventre te dira merci.  Les boissons chaudes sont ouf. J'ai pris un chocolat chaud aux épices, on m'amène lait, chocolat fondu et bâton de cannelle, à moi de le faire à ma convenance ! J'ai adoré. Le chéri a choisi le chocolat chaud au chocolat blanc, il ne s'en est pas encore remis.  On est 4, on décide de se partager le plateau de desserts, et quelle bonne idée : des merveilles sucrées toutes plus excellentes les uns que les autres. Gros coup de coeur sur les scones, la brioche, les confitures maison, la crème mascarpone vanille, le pain croustillant... Une tuerie, pas de sucre en excès, du goût, bravo.  Le plus, c'est qu'ils proposent un doggy bag pour ce que vous n'arriverez pas à finir (parce que franchement, si vous arrivez à finir tout ça je vous applaudis des deux mains), ça évite la gaspillage et c'est l'occasion de se régaler une deuxième fois à la maison.  A côté de ça, le service est souriant, agréable et compréhensif quand on a demandé de changer un dessert par un autre. Comptez pour tout ça à 4 une note autour de 140$, ce qui fait 25 par personne, et franchement, ce n'est pas cher payé du tout pour la qualité et la quantité !  Faire une heure de queue en hiver pour y retourner? Je crois que ça se réfléchit finalement :)"}
{"text":"Superb decor and even better brunch. Definitely worth a shot. Don't listen to peeps who say Yelp is only for tourists.   I'm a big foodie with excellent access to great food in Chicago. Regine's did not disappoint.  I had the Champi and it was amazing."}
{"text":"Beautiful and elegant upscale brunch place .!!! I like the service , the decor and the menu  Scotch eggs are a must .!!! The waiting is definitely worth it ....!!!"}
{"text":"Staff vraiment gentilles, café tres bon. Assiette belle presentation mais le gout et fraicheur des fruit nest pas frais du jour. Patate ordinaire, pain horrible, et espace tres limité"}
{"text":"Tout simplement une des meilleur resto pour déjeuner à Montréal!! Déco très agréable, staff super aimable et compétent mais surtout la qualité des plats qui sont servis en font un incontournable dans Rosemont petite-patrie."}
{"text":"This place is 150% worth the wait! I was completely blown away by the service and the food!   We arrived at 9:30 am on a sunny Saturday. There were already a good 20 people in front of us. The staff promptly took our names. They had a water jug outside with citrus mint water. A staff member even came out during the wait and gave us cinnamon bun tasters!   Once we finally got in after over an hour, we were greeted with a small welcome juice. Our order was taken, and the food arrived within 5 mins. We thought it couldn't possibly be ours because it arrived so quickly! I got the sale sucre (brioche with pulled ham, cheddar, and a sort of maple butter. I put a poached egg instead of a sunny side up egg) my friend got the champi with a side of spinach béchamel sauce. The mushrooms were cooked to perfection!!!!   For dessert we ordered a croissant bread pudding cake with a pistachio layer in the middle. We were STUFFED already, but once we had a bite we knew we had made the right decision! They were nice enough to put it in a to go box. I would recommend splitting this because the slice is large and a bit pricy at $7.  Overall. You've gotta go, but go with someone who doesn't mind a wait..."}
{"text":"COCONUT OATMEAL: This actually might've been the best meal I had my first trip to Montreal.  It comes with a lot of stuff too! And the presentation is ridiculously detailed and en pointe. The coconut oatmeal is so freaking good. Why isn't all oatmeal cooked in coconut milk?! And the peanut butter thing that comes on the side is also ridiculously good. I'm just in awe of whatever chef thought of this dish. I want to meet them and I want to be their friend. And if they want to cook for me too, I wouldn't say no.   THE PLACE: It's really nice inside! It definitely feels like a nice place. It gets really crowded though and they are definitely very space efficient, but they don't pack you in too tight. If you are in the area, I would definitely say to go here. If I ate dairy or eggs, I'd definitely want to try the whole menu after having the coconut oatmeal. I can only imagine how great everything is."}
