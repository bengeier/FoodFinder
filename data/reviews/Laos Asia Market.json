{"text":"Hella far from where I live, but worth the drive and gas to get my hands on authentic lao food. I love there papaya salad, make sure you ask for lao style it is sooooooo delicious, just make sure your not kissing anyone afterwards HAHAHA cause your breath will be kicking like VAN DAMNN ! My other favorite dish to order is GOY or larb seen( raw mince beef with some B in it haha) the lao folks know what im talking about. You could even eat there if you like, if you don't want to stink up your car and take it home haha.       The owners are very nice people, very friendly and alwayse smiling thats why we love coming here. Besides the hot food, theres asian vegetables, jael bong(chilli paste) balut(baby duck egg) rice and many more. Parking is easy to find the only negative I could find is the the distant from my house haha."}
{"text":"Best Lao food I've had by far at a restaurant. It tastes just like home made Lao food, and I say that out of confidence because I'll always be bias about the Lao food I get at home. My friends and I actually came here twice, two days in a row (b/c it was that good). They have a menu in Lao, Thai, and English. However, there are some things that they serve that is not on the menu (referring to English one). For example, kao nam, ka poon, larb, deep fried fish, sticky rice, long bean thum mak hoong, ect. It would be a good idea to ask the cook what else they serve. This place is also a grocery store so everything that you order is fresh. There was not one complaint about the food from my friends and I, and we were highly satisfied after finishing our meals."}
{"text":"I love this place. Feels just like home. I love their Laos style papaya salad and their desserts (nam wan) when they do have it. FYI, Laotians love spicy food... So if you love the food and still want that perfect combination of spicy and being able to enjoy your papaya... Order it with spice level \"less than medium\" lol"}
{"text":"Best place to get Laos food! In the back of their store you can sit down or do take out. My favorite dishes there is their Kao Piak (chicken noodle soup)-Kao Poun (chicken coconut curry soup)-beef Larb and Laos Style Papaya salad! Everyone there is friendly. So if your wanting good home cooked Laos food check this place out!!"}
{"text":"I had Somtam lao $6, Noodle soup $6, Mam kao Tod $7 OMG!!! I'm so happy to find this place . They also have fresh produce. reasonable price. I will be back and already recommended this market to my friends."}
{"text":"Asia style small grocery market with sweet ladies make home-made food! The beef soup and also the chicken soup and especially papaya salad are always fresh made and taste reminds me of street market of Chiang Mai :) Also have my favorite energy drink M-150"}
{"text":"I've been craving for papaya salad for quite some time now so decided to give this place a try. Exactly like many other reviews,  this place is located in the back of the grocery store.  There's a small table in the back where you can sit and eat after placing an order.  The food took some time to come out but the quality was more than average.  The papaya salad was very flavorful. The beef noodle soup was ok. Overall the experience was worth a try.  I'll have to consider coming back though.  I do like a nice sit down restaurant better and will search for a better place. If good food is more important than presentation then this place won't bother you.  In fact,  you might enjoy this place."}
{"text":"First of all I love the papaya salad. The other foods we order bamboo soup and larb. The larb was ok too much of that bitter stuff they used. The soup needed salt. The market was clean but in a sketchy part of town. I gave a three because our food didn't all come out at once it came out one at a time. Nice people working there wish they had more of a selection."}
{"text":"This place deserves more reviews!! I came here because the bf had laos friends who lived in Vegas while we were visiting. We now come here every time we go to Vegas, even taking taxi from the strip if we have to! It's a market with basic necessities and a small togo area with little seating in the back (maybe 10 seats).   I'd never had Laotian food before this place, and I've tried one more after this place in Hawaii but it doesn't top this place! I LOVE the beef larp dish and papaya salad here. So damn delicious and medium spicy is perfect for me. I recently tried the Nam Kuao dish and I'm in love.... Their Thai iced coffee is also super yummy and perfectly sweet. I wish there were Laotian restaurants in San Jose!! ):"}
{"text":"Had the nam khao $8 and the chicken noodle soup $7 (khao piak). The noodles for the khao piak weren't great they need to change the ratio of the rice flour and the tapioca starch. The broth wasn't great, and the pork blood wasn't coagulated enough and was way too porky. Yuck. The nam khao was too soggy for my preference and the flavor wasn't what I expected. Would not recommend at all."}
{"text":"I do not want to be unfair since I have not tried everything on their menu and not my kind of food, but my roommate swears by it so I will give it a decent rating. They have a small kitchen with food as authentic as it comes (as I am told), but the dining area is very small and you might have to share with others. It. It is mainly a market but it looks more like a food storage place than a market. I am sure natives will appreciate it better, but there are much better places to shop or eat elsewhere. Service is very friendly though but for the prices they charge, although not expensive, you can have much more elsewhere..."}
{"text":"Craved authentic Laos food and this place hit the spot.  A friend recommended the place. The staff was friendly and one of women even spoke English. They also have helpful menu with pictures of the food in case you don't know name of the food.  We were hungry and ordered almost everything on their menu like papaya salad, sticky rice, larb, nam, white noodle soup, and beef jerky.  The food was delicious and reasonably price.  The next time I'm in Vegas, this will be my go to spot for authentic Laos food."}
{"text":"Always always! Hung over; Kaopiek! Hungry: kaopiek, and Naam.    They got so much traditional options, it's hard to decide.  Not really moms cooking but it is the closest you'll get :)"}
{"text":"A lot of people don't know about this place! They serve authentic Laotian food in the back of the store. This is my go to place when I don't feel like cooking and I'm on that side of town.  I've pretty much have tried everything on their menu. It's written in Lao so you'll have to ask them what they have. I've never been disappointed, my kids know everyone there by now.  We've always had generous portions of food whether it was dine in or to go. Papaya salad Lao style is the way to go with sticky rice! My fav is the nam kao (Laotian fried rice with cured pork sausage) and kao piek sen (homemade udon noodle soup with chicken). The beef larb is something my husband orders every time were there.  The only thing that keeps me going there regularly is the distance! Living in the southwest part of town, we are lacking any Laotian stores in the area and home cooked food for that matter."}
{"text":"Love that it's so hole in the wall in a supermarket. I had the khao paek which is basically chicken noodle soup. It was so helpful with my intestine issues on that night."}
{"text":"Good food n good price. Very nice customer service. I will be back. Spicy good food. Yummy n yummy."}
{"text":"Nothing beats a mom and pop store/restaurant. It's pretty far from where I live but whenever I get a chance to go eat some home cooked Laotian food, I'd like to come here. They have pretty much anything you can find in a local Asian groceries store. The prices are a bit higher but they have items like fresh kaffir lime leaves, Laotian cooking tools  and a few other items you can not find at 168 or even SF Market.   If you go towards the back of the store, there's a hot food items that they serve there or do a take-out. One of the best Laotian food I've had there. A must have are their awesome papaya salad (Lao style) & chicken noodle soup! My personal favorite is the nam kaow (mixed rice wrapped) We literally just come for that!   If you have a little difficulties ordering, ask Eric to order for you (he is at the register)."}
{"text":"First thing we did when we touchdown was uber straight here! And boy it didn't disappoint. We order everything on the menu and everything tasted like authentic Lao food. Sticky rice for a dollar!! Best deal ever and everything came up to only $70 plus we had drinks and order rice too go for the seenhh haangk. Plus the tapioca ball with meat inside. Man enough said. If you want a home cook meal come here asap!"}
{"text":"Authentic style Laos and Thai food. This is my go to spot if papaya salad and larb. I love how this place gives you the option on which style of food you'd like. Believe it or not, Thai and Laos have a very different taste. Overall, the staff here is always nice and helpful, the food here is delicious, and I always find Asian groceries I need at this place."}
{"text":"Went here with my girl! She was craving some Lao food. This place wasn't bad at all."}
{"text":"I come here for the food! This Laos asian mart has a small restaurant in the back where you can order food. You can do take out or you can eat there. It is located on the corner of McLeod and Desert Inn. This part of town is kinda sketchy but I still go. My friend introduced me to this place and all the dishes I have tried were delish. I have even used this place twice to order for catering. You must try the KaoPiek and Nam! Prices are reasonable and they are all nice. Its an asian mart also!"}
{"text":"This is a family owned store and I love how I can order cooked food as well. Even though it is quite of a strike for me to it, the quality taste of the food makes it all worthwhile.   They offer uncooked food items and cookware as well, from vegetables to frozen fish to sticky rice baskets and spices.   I always forget to take photos of my food before I inhale it so I owe some food pics for this one. I usually order their beef larb, nem khao fried rice, beef noodle soup, chicken khao piek, and thai style papaya salad (they have options of laos or thai style), difference is the thai style does not have the dark fermented fish in it. All of their dishes can come as normal, mild, spicy or extra spicy."}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of Lao friends.  I have to admit I'm not really a fan of south east asian food, mostly because I'm not a fan of fish sauce.  I can eat it if its hidden, but if i can taste or smell it, then it's a bit of a turn off for me, but when you're in a group you just roll with it.  It's not that i dislike south east asian food, its just not my favorite.  This eatery is located inside an asian grocery store, mostly canned and frozen stuff, a few fresh veggies, some home made sauces and prepared refrigerated items.  My friends got papaya salad both Lao and Thai style, the Lao style is much more pungent and stronger fish sauce taste, i had a bite of both, too much fish sauce for me, but my friends loved it, you can specify the heat level too, they chose 2 chili peppers, they wished they had gone with 1 chili pepper! LOL  We also got the Laab, which i think Vietnamese call Larb, again good but i could taste the fish sauce, but i ate it with a bunch of sticky rice ($1).  We also got beef (meatball) noodle pho, it's probably the safest thing on the menu for me to eat because it was familiar with it and it didn't have fish sauce.  But since I'm adventurous my friend said i should try this other dish which was noodles in a coconut based broth, there was an option for fish or chicken.  I can't remember the name because it was not written on the menu, it was in the chafing dishes behind the counter, and they said it in Lao.  When it came out it looked like a lot of food, the bowl was filled to the top, but the bottom was filled with shredded cabbage, so there wasn't as much noodles as i thought.  The soup reminded me of some thai curry because of the coconut, i added some of the chili oil on the table and it was much better.  We also all got either a Thai iced tea or coffee, ($2) it was good and a very large size for $2 but not as strong as i would have liked it.  For me this type of cuisine is not my style, but my friends who are Lao, say its authentic, they were speaking Lao to the lady behind the counter, and they also offer Thai and Vietnamese type dishes.  Going there they suggested that i get the chicken noodle soup, but it was sold out when we got there, evidently it takes a long time to make and sells out all the time. So for me its 3 stars, but I'm sure if my friends did a review they'd give it 5 stars and i'd go back and try the chicken noodle soup.  They also have some authentic Lao sauces, i took a pic of one of the sauces that i like, i haven't tried the one from the store, but i have tried the one that my friends aunty makes, if its anything like that one, Oh man, that sauce is awesome, i eat it on steak or any grilled meat or even just rice!"}
{"text":"One of nicest Laos market I've seen in town pretty decent size compared to others, they also serve hot / cold food all made in house cafe style, I tried kaopiek which is just a chicken noodle soup made with a noodle made from sticky rice flour one of my all time favorite Lao foods it was pretty damn good."}
{"text":"I looked this up before our trip here and let me tell ya, it was SO DAMN GOOD! We ordered two larbs one raw and one cook, two papaya salad, some stick rice, two kapieks, ice thai tea and ice coffee. This is going to be my spot when i come back again!"}
{"text":"I always get pick up Tham ma hoong (papaya salad) and Tham ma toouh (green bean salad). They are both really good and flavors are close to moms. I also get their Thom Kem (adobo), man does that hit the spot.  Has the typical comfy, Laos, atmosphere, so don't expect some fancy grocerers."}
{"text":"Since discovering this place 2 weeks ago, I've been addicted to the Lao style Papaya Salad and the chicken noodle soup.   The papaya salad which is $6, a good helping and for a dollar more they can add the crab. Chicken Noodle soup- $7 also a good size helping. The noodles were perfectly cooked, chewy. Broth was super tasty. We love their pork jerry too. That about $6 or $7 per pack.  Larb- $10, it was ok Sticky rice is $1 per bag.  The only thing I don't like is they kind of skimp out on you if your not Lao or Thai. As many times as I've gone here, they never give me all the extra items for either my larb, the soup or salad. I'm missing the cabage for the papaya salad, missing the extra veggies for the larb, missing the fried garlic or shallots for the soup. Some times they add no garnish to any of the dishes. I constantly have to ask for the items.   We order our food and then we see other people order their food. And it's completely different but the same items. Lol. It's funny but also sad becuase it makes us not want to come back. Which is probably what's going to happen."}
{"text":"I live in Washington DC area and when i hit up Vegas.. i drive all the way to this little supermarket for some authentic Lao food.  Just like moms and dads but here they make that laap just a little better! And my wife love the kao piek noodles.. There not many seating so be ready to sit with others but I dont mind people there always nice!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this market...I love the food especially the nam. I buy all my ingredients here when I feel like cooking some Lao food for my husband."}
{"text":"Needed some glutinous (sticky rice) today so we went to one of the best local Laos market. I love that this place have homemade pastries & dessert and their homemade pho, khao piek sen (rice noodles soup) and many other authentic Lao soup/stew. You can also get hard to find items here like bunk khao laam (frozen sweet rice in bamboo) and frozen river snails w/o shells. They have fresh produce too, fresh thai peppers, Asian pumpkins, lemongrass, kaffir leaves etc...This is now my regular local Asian food market. Staff there are friendly too! They always remember me when I'm there and they actually miss me!! Hehee"}
{"text":"Would not be surprised if some people's first impression of the existence of a Laotian grocery store in Las Vegas would play out like the following classic conversation from King of the Hill  Hank: So are you Chinese or Japanese? Khan: No, we are Laotian. Bill: The ocean? What ocean? Khan: From Laos, stupid! It's a landlocked country in South East Asia between Vietnam and Thailand, population approximately 4.7 million! Hank: So are you Chinese or Japanese? Kahn: D'oh!   There are hole in the walls, and then there are SECRET hole in the walls (the kind you would never stumble across unless you knew it was there), and Laos Asia Market falls under the latter.  Located in a strip mall a few miles off The Strip, one finds a strip of counter space in the back end of a mom/pop Asian grocery store serving up homemade Laotian classics stripped free of all pretense and artifice.  Had it not been for the menu with the handful of offerings displayed on handwritten poster board and a few benches in front of the counter space, one could easily mistake this as simply a work station for prepared foods and miss out on this little oasis of freshly prepared Laotian cuisine.  With two sweet ladies manning the kitchen and patiently taking down orders, my friend and I felt like we were crashing some Laotian grandma's house for a home-cooked meal.    Green papaya salad comes in two styles, Thai and Lao, the latter being less sweet and sour and more savory and pungent due to heavier emphasis on the fish sauce and less on the lime juice/palm sugar.  With crisp yardlong beans, tomatoes, green papaya and peanuts, there is a slow escalation of spice that builds in the mouth due to the chilies but the cool temperature of the dish keeps it in check.    Another notable specialty to get is the Nam Khao.  Not sure what that translates to, but I would surmise it would be something along the lines of \"party in one's mouth\", where the RSVP guest list includes chunks of crispy rice, fermented pork sausage, grated coconut, peanuts, cilantro, green onion, shallots, lime juice, fish sauce, hot chilies, and perhaps a few closely guarded mystery guests (who wouldn't want to host that party?) .  Grab a few spoonfuls and wrap them in lettuce, and your mouth will thank you over and over again.     Another solid dish is the Khao Piek Sen (Lao version of chicken noodle soup), and it uses a chewy tapioca udon in a well-simmered chicken stock with crispy shallots, green onion, shredded chicken, and pork blood cubes upon request if you're feeling a little adventurous (having had it in various soups in Asia, it functions more like a morbid form of tofu when it's done properly although I wanted to prepare some of you for the \"bloodcurdling\" reaction some of you may have if they prompt you on this option).   Having struck up some conversation with a few regulars, I learned that one of the owners relatives used to run Thai Food to Go a few blocks down the street, so solid cooking definitely runs in the family.  Observing their orders, it also appears that the larb served with sticky rice, deep fried fish, and the pho (slightly different seasoning in broth compared to the better known Vietnamese version) are on my list of things to try with future visits.   Avoid being trapped between Chinese and Japanese fare.   This is an excellent primer on Laotian cuisine in a humble yet hospitable setting providing an authentic medley of flavors straddling between Thai and Vietnamese.    P.S. The store itself also offers some excellent produce, prepackaged sweet confections, and other hard-to-find ingredients for the home cooks."}
{"text":"Surprised to see a Lao restaurant/market selling authentic Lao/Thai Southeast style dishes in LV. Worth the drive! They have papaya salad lao style (best style!)"}
{"text":"Good prices for Chinese and Thai items"}
{"text":"Review #181 - 2016  My niece and I were craving Lao food because our visit to Ocha was quite dissatisfying this trip so we ventured out and found a Lao Market that actually serves up homemade Lao food in the back of the market.  When you drive out to this place, it kind of makes you wonder if anyone in this area even knows what Lao food is because you won't see very many Asian people around, but don't let that fool you.  The moment we walked into the market, we were greeted warmly as if we've known each other before.  The women at this place really treat you like their family/kids.  Really reminds me of the Lao hospitality back in our homeland.  I ordered 3 of the most commonly eaten dishes in Laos, since my niece is visiting from there and I told her to be the judge.  The kao piak (homemade chicken noodle soup) was on point.  The broth was flavorful and the noodle was the perfect consistency, slightly chewy just the way I like it.  The laab beef was also on point.  Very flavorful and cooked to less than medium--so the meat was not dry or chewy like some other places.  Unfortunately, the papaya salad was too sweet for my liking so I asked for some lime and it still didn't help much.  Next time I'll be sure to ask them to remake it for me so I don't have to adjust the flavor myself.  I even bought a few homemade dessert items from their market, which aren't too easy to find in our area either.  I took them back to Cali and my nephew told me that the desserts taste better than the ones at the Lao markets in the Bay Area and I had to agree with him.  I would've given a 5-star review had my papaya salad came out right, but I will definitely be back and give them another chance..."}
{"text":"This market is not in the best neighborhood and from the outside it just looks like a small supermarket.   They have sort of a food court thing in there, it looks very sketchy cooking station with a nice older lady working.   The food is great. I have never had laos food but I am Asian , the food here taste  very authentic Asian. Certainly looks like an authentic asian restaurant if you know what I mean... ..  Not sure what NAm kao was but tasted fresh, and the rice is crispy! Should try it if you are looking for some interesting Asian food.   Their sticky rice comes in a bag, pretty good portion I think you can share that between two people.  We also got LAAB , I think nam kao is better .   The yellow curry Thai chicken soup! Was better than any Thai restaurants!"}
{"text":"I'm impressed with the service I received. its a rarity for me to experienced great service at an Asian business. Spoke to a pleasant gentleman on the phone.      Inquiring for their hours of operations  and curious about what type of Laos hot food they had ready made.  Couple hours later as I entered the store I was greeted \"hello, welcome\". by a gentleman at the register. The store is small had good selections of frozen meats/ fish/exotic bugs. Some of their vegetables are fresh and others are wilted. Ready made dipping sauces $6 a container. The two sweet lady working behind the hot deli section, what a gem, they are informative with my many questions. She recommend Laos beef/ beef balls/rice noodle soup, it was hot flavorful, salty/sweet /beefy . Dinning table lined with green plastic cover with utensils and varied selections of condiments salt,pepper, 4 different type of chilies pickled, fresh, in oil & dried and the usual soy sauce, fish sauce, hoisin sauce.  On the menu it had two different type of papaya salad Laos or Thai. Thai papaya I was told are sweet made with fish sauce, salty crab, peanuts. We opted for Laos papaya made with pahdek a fermented fish ( anchovies) with a pungent smell, its sweet, salty, sour with each bite of crunch of the fresh shredded papaya/longbean  goodness . FYI make sure to mention your preferred level of spicy. I ordered to go larb beef, a choice of raw or cooked beef salad. The cooked beef salad were delicious, enhance flavors with variety of herbs , cilantro, lemongrass, basil, mint, rice powder a hint of citrus juice. My dad mention the beef salad was good.  On my next trip to Las Vegas I will stop in again to try their  ready made desserts  and other selections I  haven't yet tried."}
{"text":"A mom and pop Laos market that serves authentic Laos food. People are very nice and friendly. We tried their papaya salad, Larb, roasted chicken, sticky rice, kao kiap. Out of all the food the kao kiap was not good at all. The price is reasonable."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this fantastic place. Great papaya salad and chicken curry with noodles. I basically ordered everything they have to try and I have absolutely nothing bad to say about any of the dishes. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Fish Kapoon was okay...but it was great after I added more fish sauce, sugar, and red pepper :)  Roasted chicken leg was bomb.com  Lao style papaya salad was also pretty good....I soaked up the sauce with some warm sticky rice. It was ohhhh so tasty.   Never been? Walk straight to the back, order your food, eat at the tables set up in the middle of the store, and pay at the register up front. But before you do check out, you gotta stop at the fridge section by the cashier to pick up some yummy desserts, that's likely flavord with coconut milk :)  I only wish that the other parts of the menu were in English :("}
{"text":"This place is totally legit. My sister and I got the spicy papaya salad with crab and she delivered! Craving satisfied. Super nice folks and roomy grocery store."}
{"text":"Not sure why my friends love this place so much.  It sucked.  The thom khem was bad, soup was bland and clear.  It needed lots more flavor.   The beef larb was bad.  It tasted really bitter.  I wanted chicken but they were out and shouldn't have even given the beef a chance.   The roasted chicken was bad.  It was kind of a BBQ style where it was cut into pieces.  Very dry... Probably cause it's sitting out on the table!  lol   The good things: The papaya salad, the nam kao was different but was good too.  The kow piack was good as well.  But I don't think think I would recommend this place to my friends.  I'm always down for a good hole in the wall restaurant but this was not up to par.  And the place smelled a bit cause of all the produce."}
{"text":"Next time I'm in town, totally going to hit them up and so not far from the strip! Good prices. Food for khmer/thai/Lao cravings."}
{"text":"I used to go to this store all the time when I lived on the east part of town now I live so far away but still go there sometimes because they have some produce or items that I need in Indonesian cooking but I can't find it in china town or other Thai stores. I love Thai dessert selection they have but never ordered anything on their hot food section yet, I don't know how to order. The food smells good though"}
{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(340/365) \"The Little Laotian Mom & Pop Shop\"  I've always wanted to come here to pop in and have a looksee, and the perfect time came after our breakfast at The 50's Diner (Same Strip Mall). This is your smaller mom and pop type operation with not the hugest selection, but sufficient from cookware, to oodles of noodles, bottles of beverages, tons of tapioca cans of condiments and much much more.   Some of the more unique items I came across is there pickled items-young grapes, gooseberries, tamarind leaves, but sadly, no pickled tea leaves which I was hoping to find so I could duplicate the Burmese Pickled Tea Leaf Salad, a dish which has been MIA for the last couple of years at the Chaiya Monastery Food Fair(Those who know about this tasty dish know what I'm talking about.) Unfortunately this item cannot be found in Vegas (yet.) I did however grab a bag of black sesame seeds for just $1.99 which will come in handy for Black Sesame Creme Brulee, Sesame Toffee, and Black Sesame Ice Cream if and when I get an ice cream maker!  There is also a table with grab and go prepared foods which I spied Sakoo (Steamed Tapioca Dumplings) and other tasty stuff too. I also learned that there is a third kind of taco, a Laotian coconut dessert... LAM also carries some fresh produce and also have a hot food station where you can order off the menu and sit down and dine in. Not too familiar with Laotian food, I'll just refer to fellow Yelpers Christopher S. and Debra W.'s reviews and pictures before I decide to dine in. Plastic is accepted with a $15 dollar minimum, otherwise you get charged a buckaroo for it. ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  4"}
{"text":"Cute little market with good food @ deli part  and found these thai eggplants to take home that were delish!"}
{"text":"What a great little hidden gem! When you walk in, the place looks like a tiny store with a long table that seats ten people. Placed the order and it was made on the spot. Maybe took about eight minutes per dish. Had chicken larb, Nam Kuao, curry noodle soup dish, Thai tea, tomato chili sauce, sticky rice, and a banana sticky rice dessert. Great experience and so glad I tried!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Asian ingredients. It's the most fully stocked Laos/Thai specialty market in town in my honest opinion. The store itself is large. They have all of the cooking equipment you need. They have all of the sauces and ingredients you need to make authentic Thai and Laos food at home.  I admit that Chinatown has a lot of the same things for cheaper, but I support the family owned places.   They also have a little restaurant in the back. You'll find red chicken curry and even authentic Laos chicken noodle soup. You'd be hard pressed to find it anywhere unless you make it at home."}
{"text":"My wife is Laotian and we were craving Laotian food while in town from Orange County, CA and Laos Asia Market hit the spot! Their food is home-made delicious and prepared fresh. They also have a decent sized market of Asian groceries. We will definitely be back here when we return to Las Vegas in June for a wedding and we'll be bringing other family members by the market."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good prices, check them out for all your Thai / Laos food needs."}
{"text":"Visiting from Tucson, AZ and I'm so happy that we made the last Minuit stop here before heading home!! Small market that packs a big punch! There's a little cafe in the back, we ordered the nam kao and papaya salad \"spicy\" which my mom actually gave her stamp of approval! I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This was probably the high spot of my Las Vegas visit. You walk into a typical Asian market - but walk to the back of the store. You will see a small kitchen with a menu, a steam table with today's specials and a long table, set up family style. When we went, the table was half full.  We got papaya salad - they do 2 versions - Thai (sweeter and done with fish sauce) and Lao (less sweet and done with anchovy sauce). We also got the Nam Kao (a Lao fried rice - made from a fried rice ball) and the laab (or larb).   We got the laab extra spicy, since my spice loving brother was with us. He is a tall red-head and they kept asking \"are you sure\" - he was. Make it the way you would eat it he asked them. They did - and were amazed that he ate it all down with great joy! He had never had this dish before and it will be on his list.  The papaya salad was much more fishy than the Thai style - and I loved it! The fried rice is just such a different thing than any other fried rice that it is always a must eat for me.  The steam table had multiple soups, curries, and veggie dishes (alone with a couple of fish dishes) - I wish I had found this place at the beginning of my trip and I would have tried these. Next time for sure!"}
{"text":"One word \"phenomenal\". I looooove this place. They have lao and thai food!!!! Food that you can't find anywhere else in Vegas. From dessert to appetizers to the main course. You won't regret coming here!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Laos style Papaya salad @ a restaurant/market. Extremely flavorful and spicy when requested. Great pricing and friendly service. Feels like attending a family meal. Definitely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"This has become my go-to Asian market! Why deal with the hassle (and traffic) of driving to Chinatown? This place is small, but they cram a lot of goodness into a tiny space.  They really have everything I need and want (plus more). Case in point: Thai basil and kaffir lime leaves.  I have at times driven to 5-6 different stores around town looking for these items.  They have them! Plus lemongrass, galangal, a million sauces, curry pastes and noodles.  Including the GOOD Maesri Thai curry pastes that I love.  Thai chiles, tofu, baby Thai eggplants, fresh rice noodles?  AND for you meat eaters, they serve freshly made Laotian food! It's cheap, convenient (NE corner of DI and Pecos, right behind the McDs), awesome.   $10 minimum for credit/debit cards."}
{"text":"Let's just say I come here on a daily for their papaya salad :) so far it's the best papaya salad in Las Vegas out of 12 other locations I've tried. Plus everyone in there are nice and they also has other varieties of food too to choose from. But you can't go wrong with the papaya salad :)"}
{"text":"A pretty special spot. Feels very authentic, in the back of an Asian food market. Also picked up some awesome dried mushrooms and shrimp paste for my home cooking. Couldn't be more pleased with this experience. The aunties cooking my food were friendly and talkative.  I couldn't believe I found such an awesome place."}
{"text":"I came here for papaya salad from a friend introduced it to me. This is just a small local market but they cook & serve food here too. Papaya salad is the must order with 2 style Either Thai or Lao style are all good. They can make it extremely spicy as you wish. The lard Beef salad is very good too. Besides that if you come in early morning you can buy the dessert sesame balls which are very crispy & have coconut inside make it taste so good too."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found this place, been coming here for a few years now to pick up groceries that aren't sold in American grocery stores. Being Laotian and finding this place has been great especially when I am craving Lao food because I'm too lazy to cook it at home or just don't know how haha. They have all the basic food necessities I need to make Lao food at home, thank god! You can order Lao food in the back and take it to go if you prefer to not eat there. It's pretty close to homemade which is awesome cuz I hate it when they Americanize authentic Asian food, definitely doesn't taste as good. If you're craving larp, nam, kao piek, or even papaya salad with some sticky rice stop by here, you won't be disappointed!! They have more food items but those are usually what I order when I come here."}
{"text":"We tried to come here on our first day in town and were SO sad because they were closed! You order your food first and then pay after you're done eating. We came today and ordered kaopiak and nam. The kaopiak broth was flavorful and the noodles were very soft. The nam was a bit too limey for my taste, but I started having a more acquired taste for it as I ate more. My friend ordered the kapoon and that was also very good. It's definitely a hole in the wall type of place. Nothing too glamorous, but the food was delicious and very affordable. The way they have their food is deli style. So there's a hot table where you can see the food and choose what you want."}
{"text":"Recently, I passed this store while driving to work. After I finished my shift, I decided to visit the market. As I entered,  The employees greeted me very kindly. The smell of chicken was very delighting, Especially since I was hungry but as I looked around the groceries caught my sight. They had all kinds of Asian items from Authentic to Traditional. They're Thai Tea and coupoon was just fantastic! I can't even describe it with words. The Thai tea was so creamy and smooth. The taste was just right and the coupoon had the perfect spicy taste that I just love! This market was just amazing, I'm glad that I was able to experience such a great place!"}
{"text":"My favorite cure for a hangover the next day from a night of partying is this place because they have the best chicken noodle Lao style! Comfort food for me being away from home. This place has everything you to get you to feel like your mom just cooked you a meal, from nam khao to pho. Come here if you want to feel better after a heavy night of drinking!"}
{"text":"This is a small hole in the wall store that have many of our Thai specialties, I or my mom usually need for our Thai Laos fix. It also serves as a little \"dive\" as I would call it, with the best papaya salad I've had in a while amongst other items on their menu. This coming from a Thai person who's traveled to Thailand and had awesome street food..Not much on the item but delicious. You have to try the beef noodle soup... The customer service here is also great. They greet you right away and is always willing to help you look for things if needed. They also treat you like family. They remember what I or my mom order and is always courteous and ask about our family. You don't really find a lot of places like this anymore. Some people might get turned off by the fact that it's also a grocery store but I feel like that's the authenticity of it all. So I recommend this to people who is looking for an authentic taste and experience. They also have Thai desserts and snacks that are to die for."}
{"text":"Only Laos store in my area, Has everything i need and everything I want, my favorite thing to cop here is the pork/beef jerky, they sell out quick so I would recommend to go in the afternoon! When I'm here i make sure to get the papaya salad with that sticky rice, that shee is on point!"}
{"text":"I love this place for my shopping and their papaya salad. Although, everything they cook in that kitchen is pure magic. My family is from Cambodia and I was raised in Providence, RI while living in Connecticut. There was a heavy Southeast Asian influence in the part of Providence we often frequented. When we moved here about 8 years ago, it quickly vanished from my vision and my mother would go searching to no avail. Finally we found this wonderful gem and felt right at home with the food and the small family business appeal we were use to. I love being able to talk to the owner as i check out. They are nice and the food is authentic to the region. It reminds me of everything I grew up with."}
{"text":"I'm going to be really basic here because my wife's family own this place and we've been accustomed to having these dishes for years. so here you go.  Larb with sticky rice (fave) papaya salad  kow piek sen (noodles in a chicken ginger broth with blood) (fave) pho sai gob (laos sausage my fave)   also check the desserts out they are top notch laos/Thai desserts  lod chong sangkaya  kanom chan lomit  sakoo   one more thing if you see pork jerky on sale don't sleep on it is probably the best pork jerky I've ever had.   also this is a market as well and if you need to cook Asian you can pretty much find the ingredients you need here. happy eating guys"}
{"text":"First time here to Vegas and I was craving for lao food. The food here was awsome.... it was just right and satisfying. Thank you, can't wait to visit again and have their bomb ass good!"}
{"text":"A family friend told me about this place.  We normally go to Bangkok Market which is closer to our home.  However, we decided to drive a bit further and give it a try.  Its definitely bigger than it looks from the outside. The store has everything you need to pretty much cook a thai or laosian dish.    You'll also find an area that serves ready-made dishes with a few tables and chairs to eat in or take home for dinner.  The aunties behind the counter were extremely nice and very helpful.  We ordered the thai beef noodle soup which was amazing.  Condiments were set on the table and it had everything that you would need.  We also tried the Laotian-style papaya salad. It's more flavorful than the Thai version.  I do have to add..get the THAI ice tea.  Best I've had so far.  Freshly made and only $2.  Prices for food was very reasonable with small containers being $4 and large ones being $6."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas this past weekend and our friends took us here to eat and I am soooooooo glad they did! This has got to be one of the best Lao's hole in the wall place I've been to. It is a market but there is seating inside so you can dine in. If you are ever in Vegas, don't forget to stop by. Prices are good, food is FIRE and the family is very friendly!"}
{"text":"I see this place on my way to the gym and I decided to pull in, as I was looking for bean paste for the dish I was making for a potluck.  I took a stab and thought that they may have had some there. This place is obviously a specialty store and caters to South East Asian foods and goods.  It's not a huge place but it was clean and friendly.  I was here for maybe 5 minutes and then asked if they had what I was looking for.  Long story short, they didn't have any bean paste, and I knew I was taking a chance.  But, they couldn't have been nicer to me and apologized for not having my item."}
{"text":"Talk about a total life saver and relief!!! I'm of South East Asian descent and originally from CA so the access to all my SEA food needs were less than 10 to 15 minutes away but since moving to NV, it's been a drag to drag 30 minutes plus to China town! I happened to be craving traditional Lao dish, Kapoon and while was in Henderson I saw the closest \"Asian store\" was only 15 minutes away and happened to be a Lao store! I was thankful to see I wouldn't have to trek across town to Chinatown and attempt to fight traffic on my way home.   The store is extremely clean and all their items were  in stock. everything was lined up perfectly and importantly the veggie area was neat! I literally walked down every aisle smiling because all the items were familiar to me and that I could make my favorite Laos dish! In attempt to explore the store and gather all my ingredients, it just so happens this mom and pop shop has a mini kitchen too and serves freshly mad Kapoon (curry noodle soup)! I ordered chicken kapoon ($7) and a side of Lao style papaya salad ($6) to dine in. The kapoon was great and thankfully they had condiments for me to kick up the spice level but I understand why their spice level for it is a mild because it can get very spicy quick.  The papaya salad was ok, I've had better but only because I've been spoiled living in a highly dense SEA CA town!   So I bought all my ingredients to make my anticipated dish but couldn't help to also try the store's kapoon too! So double whammy? :p I highly recommend this Store for anyone looking for specific items to make SEA dishes! I'm definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"I had driven 3.5 hours from CA to Vegas & this was my first stop for food. The two ladies were so helpful & sweet and were willing to make us a meal even though they were closing. All dishes were made with love. I had my Laotian food fix satisfied!!"}
{"text":"Smdh I had nothing but good things to say until I was sold an outdated drink that had expired! No wonder it tasted a bit off! ?"}
{"text":"Best Lao style papaya salad and chicken khao piek and there beef laab taste just like the one my dad makes"}
{"text":"We had thai tea, larb gai (minced chicken) papaya salad and nam khao. My favorite dish was the nam khao. I would of gave them a 5 Star but the food was too spicy for us to finish the larb or the papaya salad. That was the only downside, it was too spicy. Other than that, I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I had only frequented the Laos Market on Las Vegas Blvd, so finding this place close by was a nice find. Virtually the same set up with lots of veggies, asian foods, frozen fish and meats, and a counter serving up Laos and Thai foods like Papaya Salad.   This space is bigger than the other Laos Market, so it doesn't feel as cramped. They could add a lot more items if they chose to. Prices seemed a bit high, but not outrageous compared to other asian markets. My friend who I took was a happy camper, she came out with over a $100 worth of goodies. My one disappointment was that they didn't carry Coconut water. They had coconut juice but I prefer the water. They had a delicious marinated pork belly at the counter!"}
{"text":"Combination mini restaurant/market.  Many authentic choices very reasonably priced. They sell quality curry paste (Mae Anong, Maesri) and have multiple selections for most products.  I can't say the folks who work there are very friendly/customer service oriented... however, when I did initiate a question about vegan options, one female employee that I approached was helpful and answered all of my questions.  She definitely knew her inventory.  Just an FYI - $15 minimum for credit card use (including debit cards) which for a local ethnic mom/pop business, I think is fine. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"It is as good as it gets.  This small & quaint market is always my go to spot. Especially, If I am in the food for some Thai or Laos food. You cannot go wrong with anything here, especially the papaya salad and larb. And if you love soo moo (fermented pork sausage), they have some of the best here. And their soups, from the chicken noodle to curry soup.   Gael Kapi (fermented fish hot sauce) & Gael Bong (sweet & thick spicy paste) are two of my favorites sauces you can find here.  The quality and freshness of their prepared food & products is always consistent - fresh and superb.   Their prices are hard to beat as well when it comes to their fresh produce and food. You might pay a slight premium on other items such as canned or dry good but since this is closer to me and I don't have to go to China town, I am okay with that.   Again, I cannot stress enough how awesome the staff is here."}
