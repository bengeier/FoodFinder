{"text":"First time here..was not disappointed I had the Ruben with potato salad...Excellent .....my wife had the Gyro and pasta salad ,also excellent We will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"I've been here twice: weekday and Saturday lunch. Fresh salads (although Greek dressing nothing special) and varied menu. They hit the mark with Greek specialties! Kids ordered usual chicken fingers and wound up devouring our gyros, humus, and spanikopita (sp?). Very friendly and attentive waitress both visits. Took home desserts--delish!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Very nice place, perfect music volume. Food is excellent. Food is Greek/Mediterranean. Food is very good. This is not a fast Greek food place like Showmars, but it is not fancy. Average meal price is about 10 bucks with drink.

Oh, and the orzo is fantastic! ;) hummus and tyrokafteri are homemade and very tasty. Veggie spears were a little on the skimpy side, but the flavor made up for the price diference. I'll be coming back here often!"}
