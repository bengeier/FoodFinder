{"text":"Everything was awesome. Olivios grill closed and  this is for sure my new Greek joint. Taziki was perfect. Yellow rice was full of flavor. My roommate had extra gyro meat and he said it it was almost TOO MUCH, but it was so good he ate every bite"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  I ended up at this restaurant as my desire for Greek food was not satisfied at nearby locations.   The staff here are excellent.  Very friendly and very helpful if you have any questions with food options.  The restaurant is very clean and the food is very fresh.  I had the \"Greek Night Club\" Gyro and it was delicious.  You are given the option of sides ranging from fries to salad.  Value-wise I would say that it is excellent as I thought that the price was fair for the freshness of the food and I didn't leave hungry."}
{"text":"Best gyros in town, but Cynthia is the real reason we come here. Been here over 25 times and she always remembers our usual order is pleasant and efficient  Cynthia is the face of Mikas Greek."}
{"text":"Usually go to the Scottsdale location but was in the area of the new location. The restaurant was very clean, the service was great and the food was very good!"}
{"text":"This place has great food!!  I love their fresh salads with grilled chicken and their gyros are the best!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good.  Nice job with interior finishes, service very friendly.  Good value and good food"}
{"text":"So I've been out biking all afternoon and it's still a gorgeous day so I want to sit outside somewhere and eat something. I stop at this little Gyros shop in an obscure corner of Papago Plaza for the sole reason that it has a great outdoor seating spot -wide, well shaded, far enough from the street and a decent view over Skysong with a bit of the Supes peaking through.  And the food is fantastic!! I had the chicken Pita, which was astoundingly tasty, with a great salad and it's $6.25? How is that possible? And the service (I think that was George?) couldn't have been better. And the place inside is clean and bright.   Nobody could ask for more."}
{"text":"Gross, mass-produced approximation of greek \"style\" food. Falafel was clearly from a frozen bag and pita was also clearly store bought, not home made. I have to admit the staff was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Food and service was amazing. Food is prepared to order! Was a little hesitant because the location is in a small shopping plaza but turned out to be fantastic. The Decor was really modern and nice! Me and my wife both had gyro's which were great! Love Greek food!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place for gyros!! Large portions, choice of fries, salad or soup with with gyro for under $8.00. Everything was fresh and clean. Service was friendly and quick. Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"My go-to Greek joint. I recommend the original gyro or the jalapeño hummus with chicken. Very friendly staff....this place is SUH GUUUD"}
{"text":"Its pretty good place. Last time the service wasnt the best, but anyways, the food is Ok .Lentil SOUP is great."}
{"text":"First time there today for lunch and I am definitely a fan now.  The salad is excellent, the chicken moist and tender.  The hummus and pita starter is delicious too!    I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I had the chicken and vegetable skewer, both were excellent and cooked to perfection.  The staff is very friendly and the service was excellent.  I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"First time here and will definitely be back! I had the original Picato and it was FANTASTIC!!!! The place was very clean and the staff was well versed on the menu and very friendly and helpful! Can't wait to come back and try something else!!"}
{"text":"It's college move-in weekend so we're new to the area. The pita sandwiches were delicious, and we really loved the unique village salad."}
{"text":"Oohhh, I usually order a Greek Night Club pita with chicken, but upon feeling indecisive and learning that Mika's has online ordering...one of the meat choices listed was 1/2 chicken 1/2 gyro. Um, yes please! They had all sorts of options that you can customize with a simple click of a button (white or wheat pita? no onions? extra sauce? cut in half? etc. Boom! Done.) It even gave me a pick-up time and I received text notifications when my order was in-process and ready for pick-up. Having already paid online, I just walked in, was handed my bag, and went on my way. The whole process was very simple, convenient, and fast! Plus, I didn't have to mispronounce gyro over the phone. Hahaha. Score!   My pita was excellent ~ stuffed full of gyro, chicken, lettuce, tomato, onions, kalamata olives, tzatziki, and feta! Mmm! It was a little on the salty side, which I actually like, but just something to consider if you're sensitive to that sort of thing. The side greek salad was also very good. One of these days I'll get around to trying the lentil soup...  All in all, you can get a great, fast, filling meal here for less than $10, that you feel about eating. WIN."}
{"text":"I love Mika's.  My girlfriend and I often find ourselves wandering in once a week when we do not feel like cooking but dont want to eat garbage food out. In a society where we constantly have disgusting fake food pushed in our face it is nice to know there are still options out there that serve REAL food.  The service is phenomenal.  The ladies behind the counter are always very nice, even when we stroll in at 8:30pm and they close at 9pm (I'd be grumpy).  We usually dine in and the food is brought out to us in a very timely manner, usually still piping hot.  The food.  Every time I go I get the chicken picado with basmati rice. Every single time I get a tingly feeling in my loins after I eat it.  When I am balling out, I get extra chicken (more on this later).  I put some siracha on the rice and go to work.    I would probably eat here everyday if could and never get tired of it.  The ONE downfall.  Pricing.  It is decently priced for a standard meal ($7-$9).  However, if you like to spice it up and get extras you can really run up the tab.  Extra meat is $2.95 and extra veggies etc is $0.95.  Dont matter doe Ill still go back."}
{"text":"Best gyro ever! We drive out of our way to come eat here and we've never been disappointed! Always good portions, fresh, and clean."}
{"text":"Saw the reviews, everything looked great so my boyfriend and I each got a platter with fries and rice. His was the gyro platter and mine the chicken souvlaki.  Being from the middle east, I have high standards for hummus and other Mediterranean food. While the fries and rice were good, the hummus, tzatziki, and chicken all had a too-lemony flavor which definitely is not how those foods should taste.  To mange things infinitely worse, in the middle of the night I wake up to my first symptom of food poisoning, by early morning I'm in the er with an iv.  Eight hours later I was discharged, but an still recuperating.   While my boyfriend didn't get sick, do you really want to run a 50/50 chance of food poisoning?   Do yourself a favor and avoid this place."}
{"text":"Place is clean and nice. I wanna give it more stars because the food is not bad (not great tho) but the price just doesn't add up for what they give you. 2 pita sandwiches probably should cost $20. Chicken salad probably should be $12. Also I hate being nickel and dime'd for small stuff like 75 cents to add tomatoes. Plenty of other gyro spots that are just as good for cheaper."}
{"text":"One word. PATHETIC.  I have ordered out from Mika's five times. None of those experiences were impressive. The last time, about 3 weeks ago, was the worst.  The woman who took my order over the phone could not get it right. She spoke English fluently, but kept repeating the wrong order. I finally spelled it out for her.    After I picked up my order and got it home, I found that my HOT grilled Greek Chicken was packed in the same container as my COLD Greek Salad. Needless to say the salad was wilted and inedible. Plus they put in ONE Kalamata Olive. ONE!  The feta cheese was miniscule; and the salad greens were wilted & soggy. Only good item was the chicken, after I reheated it. My wife ordered Chicken SOUVLAKI with Rice. That was ok.  But we also ordered from the Kid's Menu: Grilled Greek Chicken with Fries.  ( Yeah, I know. A \"Greek\" restaurant that serves French Fries.)  It would have been acceptable if the fries were cooked correctly. But these potato strips were beyond pathetic. Cold, soaked in old smelly deep fry oil that probably hadn't been changed in a year. They resembled sponges. If you twisted them, oil would pour out. Of course the chicken was packed in the same container as the pathetic fries, so it all stunk from old dirty deep fry oil.  I was going to throw it out along with my wilted salad, but then decided to offer the chicken & frys to my dog.  He took one whiff of them and walked away hungry.  Here's what I witnessed another time at Mika's Greek: I drove over there and ordered takeout. Greek Grilled Chicken and Dolmathes.  I sat in their \"dining room\" at a high stool & table. I watched the \"chef\" in the open kitchen.  It was then that I saw that he did not wash is hands after handling raw chicken. He would take the poultry out of a container and toss it on the hot grill with bare hands . Then he would wipe his contaminated hands on a side towel. Then use the same side towel to wipe up the work station.   At that point the chef noticed me watching him. He realized he committed health code violations. But he STILL didn't correct them. Now he put on foodsafe gloves while handling raw chicken, but then only rinsed his gloved hands off with cold water, wiped hands on the previously salmonella soiled side towel, and proceeded to make the raw cold vegetable Greek salad.   When I got the food home I put the hot food into my warming oven for 2 hours at 200°F. That would kill the bacteria that \"chef\" had given me.  Chicken was ok, albeit dry, but at least I knew I wouldn't spend the night in the ER with food borne illness. One last note. Remember the Dolmathes that I mentioned earlier? In case you don't know, these are grape leaves stuffed with rice. When I bit into mine, there was no rice. Mika's Greek stuffed MY Dolmathes with...you ready......?.....Mashed up soggy french fried potatoes.  I kid you not.  So my grade for Mika's Greek in PHX is.....an \"F\"."}
{"text":"The Gyro was incredible. The original hummus was bland but that wont stop me from coming back!"}
{"text":"Yum! I love the spicy gyro...can't remember it's name, but it was really good. They give you a lot of meat. I mean, really a lot of meat...which is what I like. If you order your food to go, they put it in a nice aluminim-kind of thingie which keeps your food hot. My drive was about 30 min before I got home and my gyro was still hot. The fries was gone by the time I got to the freeway though...it was delish!"}
{"text":"First time I have been here, like others I was impressed by the cleanliness and modern feel of the building. What really stood out though was the food. I had the Greekpeno pita with the beef souvlaki which was wonderfully spiced. The Greek fries we're also amazing with the dressing and feta generous put on top of the fries. I thought the peppers would overpower the dish but it all mingled very well together. Service was great and the employees were nice.  Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Very delicious. Lentil soup was fantastic and the Caesar gyro was excellent. Prepared quickly and the portions were large. A bit on the pricey end, but still somewhere I'll return to."}
{"text":"So good!! Got the mediterranean pita with jalapeno hummus.. so so delish! Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a light lunch last Saturday and ordered the village salad with gyro meat. I was surprised at how clean the place was and had high expectations. When I received my Village salad it was nothing more than a $0.79 can of garbanzo beans with a sprinkling of tomatoes cucumbers and red onion there was no feta and the dressing was pathetic. It was more like hospital food. When I asked the manager on duty to please fix it they she argued with me so I asked for my money back and got more attitude.   If you're going to serve something and charge $8 for it at least make it edible and worth $8 I won't be back I was very disappointed. Had they given me my money back promptly  or fixed the salad they would have gotten a 3 to 4 star rating.  I understand sometimes things go wrong but that wasn't the case here.  I'm still wondering how they have such a high rating?"}
{"text":"Delicious! The jalapeño hummus is really good and loved the spicy chicken skewers - flavorful and tender"}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise! We were searching for a quick bite to eat but l usually don't enjoy fast food joints. This sounded different and well worth a try. We decided to have the \"Greek Sampler,\" which had 3 Falafel, 3 dolmades, tzatziki, generous serving of homemade hummus with 8 warm pita quarters. Every item was fresh and savory.  \"Mika's Fries\" seriously the Best! Fries tossed with there Greek house dressing, topped with feta, tzatziki and gyro. Yummy!  The staff was super friendly and the restaurant is clean, new and nicely decorated. The only thing missing is some music"}
{"text":"This place is so good and fresh and everyone there is so nice! I've never been so satisfied by a Greek restaurant until now. And it was incredibly clean. Kudos~"}
{"text":"You like Greek? You gotta give Mika's a try! Pitas and platters that are delicious and affordable. Try their souvlaki or geek wings"}
{"text":"Came to this location and restaurant for the first time yesterday 6/19/17. The salads were huge portions and the chicken was great. I went to the Elliot location today 6/20, because we had such a great experience at Mill Ave. It was night and day difference. Chicken sucked at Elliot and portions were half the size..."}
{"text":"I ordered the Greek Salad. It was good, but I had this yesterday at the Mill Ave location and it was twice the size. I'll keep going to Mill Ave location instead. $18 for 2 Greek Salads one with chicken and one without. I feel ripped off and the chicken sucked."}
{"text":"Awesome Greek food! So happy to have found this spot, the ingredients they used were fresh and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Don't be deceived by its strip mall location, this place is legit!! Great gyro meat, lamb kabobs-like, greek fries, salad and lentil soup! All very reasonably pricedand we had leftovers. Place and bathrooms super clean."}
{"text":"Very good Gyro and Salad.  Hummus was a little salty, but had great flavor.  I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a place to have a pitas. This place is great!  The food is wonderful. The service is awesome and it's impeccably clean."}
{"text":"Nice place. Very modern and clean. Everyone seems very friendly. Prices are reasonable. I wouldn't say I ever crave their food, but it's basic Mediterranean selection. Never had anything bad here though. Been here multiple times and I will keep returning. Like it better than the other Greek/Mediterranean restaurants in the neighborhood. They're fairly quick too. Good gyros and Greek salad!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Scottsdale needed a good, fresh Greek place that wasn't run by a bunch of dodgy characters. Love the atmosphere but nothing tops the food. Healthy, fresh & delicious!"}
{"text":"So, I had The Gyro & Fries. It was pretty good I had Better But there's a lot worst out there too. The atmosphere is real nice real clean, Its only been open 4 days so I hope It stays that way. Nice and Friendly staff. The only thing I would say I wasn't a fan of and to be honest it's not that big of a deal. I prefer white onions on my Gyro not Red but it's still was good. I'll Go Back For Sure"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! I come here for lunch a few times a week with my coworkers. Their pitas are fantastic!  The Greek chicken is some of the best in town and their greek fries!!"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of both the food and location.  So happy to have a little Greek food in the heart of mid-town Phoenix.   It's conveniently located across the street from St. Joseph's hospital 1/4 mile from Central Ave.  My husband and I started with the falafel appetizer.  In my opinion, they make the one of the best falafel's I've ever tasted!  Crispy and spicy!    I also ordered the cucumber salad - very refreshing (although I would ask for the sauce on the side next time).  We order Gyros for lunch - the meat was great and the serving is generous.   Oh, and I ordered the Greek fries served with lemon/garlic sauce -- yum, yum.  My only critique is that I prefer my Tziki a little more garlic and thicker than how they serve it at Mika's.  It's set up more like a fast food joint, but everything is made fresh there on the premises and the inside is very nice, but small.   Give it a try if you are in Central Phoenix at an event at the Heard, or an exhibit at the Phoenix Art Museum.  And, lucky you if you work downtown :)"}
{"text":"We were doing some business nearby and needed a quick bite to eat. Took a chance on this place and it was great. Good food, quick service, clean restaurant and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Very good and freshly prepared \"quick food\" Greek/Med food, clean modern space with nice seating. I just moved into the neighborhood and was delighted to find Mika's...and find is the key word.  It is located in the Papago Plaza strip mall ( abit of 1950's Pueblo Kitsch) and like pretty much all the businesses there has no road signage.  It is on the southwestern side of the mall on the Scottsdale Road side.  Worth looking for!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bit and I was wrong about quick. I waited in line for 10 mins my mistake for going during the lunch rush.  I ordered the jalapeño hummus which I felt was really dry, my gyro was good just like any other place I felt and my Greek fries tastes normal. Nothing really stood out for me.  It's a real normal place just like any other chain"}
{"text":"Great greek food with fast and high quality service. Everything I tried was delicious! The food is reasonably priced, and they have a good history of getting all of our office orders right, which is a rarity nowadays it seems!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I wish I didn't know about this place because now I am obsessed with their Grilled Chicken Pita. It's just absolutely delicious! It's got to be the tzatziki sauce that makes the pita even more flavorful. If you are craving Greek food and looking for something new, you should check this place out! And be sure to come in hungry because they really stuff the pita with meat!"}
{"text":"First timers and this place is soooo good! I always like a place that doesn't mind you to watch them prepare/cook your food. It is open, inviting, and clean. The staff is wonderful! So friendly and willing to help. I saw the gentleman guiding a confused couple through the menu. He was gracious and patient with them. The food was prompt but fresh and delicous. The meat was spiced to perfection and the mika greek fries were delicous as well. The menu is adventurous for a Greek place, which was refreshing. Some very traditional mixed in with a touch of modern flavors. We had the diablo pita which had Sriracha and fresh chopped veggies, see? Different. The portions were generous. They didn't hold back at all! Will definitely be returning and would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"First time going today and I  really enjoy it the food was really good better then my expectation.  I was debating in going because normally don't end up not liking a new place."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!!!!  Grilled chicken pitta and gyro picante ordered with salads absolutely great loads of flavor great portion size and great value. Defiantly become a regular haunt. Staff were so helpful and happy great to chat with while waiting for the awesome food"}
{"text":"Rock-solid new design. The Chipotle of gyros in Scottsdale. Highly recommend the Picado!"}
{"text":"We tried this spot out tonight for the first time and we will definitely be back. The food was outstanding! Ordered a chicken pita and gyro pita. Both were filled with lots of meat and the hummus and tzatziki sauce were wonderful."}
{"text":"Saw this place pop up on nearby restaurants because I live in the area and I have been looking for new places. I enjoy gyros and was skeptical until the food came out. The lentil soup was amazing but meat was outstanding. Best gyro meat I have had in the valley. Will be returning again and may become a very frequent take out spot for me. Creative pitas and flavors too so I can't wait to try more."}
{"text":"Hi.  I was super excited to try Mika's as my coworkers had raved about it.  It is within walking distance to our building, so super easy to get to!  I did an online order for a falafel pita and loved the ease of ordering and text status updates.  I was disappointed, however, that I was told at the counter that the falafel contains egg, even though it doesn't list that as an ingredient online.  I asked the person to confirm and she was certain that it did.  I've been vegan for 10+ years and eat at Pita Jungle and Tzikii (which are both down the street) at least once a week and have no issues finding tons of options (including falafel without egg) at those locations and Mediterranean places nationwide.  Any chance you will be changing the recipe soon?  If not, we'll need to leave it off the list."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst pita I've ever had. I ordered a vegetable pita and it showed up and it was just filled with nasty tomatoes that were so soggy they drenched the bread to the point of mush. I could not eat this. It was dripping and the bread was like it was soaked in liquid. So grosssssss. My salad was good. But my son was eating his and started yelling and spit it out. Claimed it tasted like hand sanitizer. Mind you he loves Greek salads and vinager and he ate 75% of it before he had the rancid bite. The cucumbers that came with the hummus we're soggy. My bf enjoyed his gyro pita though. I spent forty five dollars to be completely disgusted with my dinner. The delivery fee was $7.00 which is a lot in my opinion. Won't ever order from here again."}
{"text":"Favorite spot for *fast* Greek food! I've been a customer since they first opened- staff is always very helpful and friendly, owners remember you and are always sincerely grateful for your business. Food always comes out fast, and they are great at accommodating any requests when/if they are able to. I've had nearly everything on the menu at this point, and everything is always fresh, fast and flavorful in the true Greek tradition. Decor is very modern and clean with a nice nod to the beauty of Greece in the artwork- and the restaurant's always very, very clean. Favorite menu items are their baklava and the lentil soup- delicious!! This place is a great addition to the line up in the local area."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place out because who doesn't like a little OPA! in their life? I must say this place is killer. Clean and modern inside, helpful staff, and great Greek food.   I had the Grilled Greek Chicken platter and my Fiance had the Gyro platter. We both split the Hummus sampler. The gyro meat was moist and flavorful, grilled chicken with cooked to perfection with just enough spice to know it's \"Greek Chicken\", and the Hummus and Tzatziki were just out of this world!   Overall it was a good experience, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great for kids -- and their grandparents.  Took all three grandchildren and all of us were happy with our meals.  Kids portions actually seem adult sized.  We were kinda like the Three Bears -- one had the chicken wings, 2nd had the grilled chicken, and the 3rd had the gyro.  Kids got right down to business and we could tell they were very happy with their dinner.   I was truly amazed at the amount of gyro meat for a child!  One grand-daughter sampled the rice that came with my delicious falafel platter, then asked for more -- wondered what gives it the yellow color.  Plenty of FRESH pita comes with all the plates.  This was our third time (husband and I) to come to Mika's, and all three times we've been very impressed: very clean, bright, roomy, friendly service, healthy and savory food.  First visit was with a DealChicken(I think--maybe it was a Groupon), so I'm hoping Mika's was well rewarded with that venture.  AND, daughter-in-law stopped in to retrieve her two daughters, decided to order, savored --  said Mika's will be on her restaurant rotation, too.  Opa!  My five stars-- for a quick meal, can't be beat.  Not for a date night aimed to impress, be aware."}
{"text":"Never had a bad visit here. This is the hidden gem of Scottsdale! Fresh food, friendly customer service, and no wait! If I had to pick one thing that stood out to me, it would have to be the cleanliness. Cleanest restaurant I've ever been to. Definitely recommend Mika's to all my friends!"}
{"text":"This place was great! For the prices, they really give you a good portion of well-cooked food. The Diablo gyro pita is delicious. Their Mika fries are delicious. The souvlaki has a really good flavor to it. You'd be hard pressed to find a Greek restaurant that'll have as good of food for the price. It's the same prices pretty much as pita jungle, but better food. The ambiance is modern and goes well. Service was good and the place is clean. I will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken wrap with salad for side. Ordered online and picked up at store. Was very convenient.   Pita wrap was pretty good. Fresh ingredients. Good taste. Got ALOT of chicken in the wrap so I put it on my salad.    I will come back for lunch at some point since it's nearby my work place.  But wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. Pretty good overall. Met my craving for Greek. Wouldn't say it's authentic but the meat and veggies are fresh! And the prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Clean. Modern. Delicious. The Greek fries are soooo good and topped with TONS of feta. The Chicken Soulvaki is cooked perfectly. Service is prompt and prices are reasonable. Closed Sundays."}
{"text":"We ordered gyros and a Greek sampler.  Everything was good and tasted fresh.  It's clear that their food is made in house.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I live within a mile of this place and had been wishing for a good Greek restaurant to open up (plenty of not so good ones are already open).  Got my wish with this place.  The food is excellent, especially the chicken.  I really like that the owner, Don, is always in there working and taking pride in what he does.  Very friendly service, very modern and clean restaurant.  I eat here at least once a week. - never disappointed.  They are also very good and fast with call in orders."}
{"text":"Food was very good, tried the gyro picado '& a pleasant spice to the meat."}
{"text":"Fast and Fresh Greek Fare in Phoenix.  Me and my coworker stopped in to try the new location in Phoenix.   I ordered the Gyro Pita, which was filled with a tender and flavorful beef & lamb mixture with a good spice mixture that enhanced the meat without being overpowering, which is a common problem at greek places.  The pita was fresh and warm and filled with a good amount of meat, and not buried under a lot of lettuce and other \"fillers.\" French fries were fresh, hot and crisp.  All the ingredients were very fresh tasting and lacked the \"reheated\" fare you get at other places. Although I would have preferred a bit more tzatziki sauce, it was still one of the best Gyros I have had around downtown Phoenix in a long time.  My coworker, a vegetarian, had the falafel and found them very flavorful and light, and had similar comments about the fresh taste of his lunch.  We will be adding this place to our normal lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Loved it!  I honestly did not expect much when coming to this restaurant. But, it's got an awesome little vibe  to it, great prices, and good food.  The front hostess/cashier, Amy, was super friendly and totally cool! She was very helpful with getting my order exactly right , which really meant a lot!   I gave it 5 stars because of the food quality compared to the low price and because of the Amy at the front...."}
{"text":"Meh. Don't understand the 4 star rating. Nothing special. It's like fast food Greek, like Daphne's. Pretty mediocre. Plus they screwed up my online order, gave me gyro meat instead of chicken. Also, they didn't give me any utensils. Greek Pita is the way to go."}
{"text":"Got this for lunch today for the first time. It's so good I'm posting a review. Get the grilled chicken pita with fries! AH-mazing!!! Will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"Nothing special here, just food that is quick, cheap, and good. Stopped by after work to grab a quick dinner, $8.58 well spent. Had the greek beef night club souvlaki, with lentin soup. Food was pretty decent, have had better for the price. The lady at the cash register was friendly, and there is a bench by the entrance setup specifically for to-go patrons. I may give this place another chance next time I am in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"food is authentic! Didn't take long at all!! gyros + greek fries = heaven in my mouth  a little pricey but worth it!"}
{"text":"If you like eating fast food then proceed. If not, then skip this place. The food was not fresh, you could tell the lettuce had been sitting out. They had tiny strips of onions, and a few baby cubes of bell peppers as the \"veggies.\" The pita was way overstuffed with chicken. /: my boyfriend got the felafel pita... he took two bites, the second one he actually spit onto a napkin. I do not recommend this place, and will never be going back!"}
{"text":"My grandson and I both got the kids meal gyros, his with fries, mine with rice and we both enjoyed them!  Great price too.  It's great to have this next to my doctor.  We will be back!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"ok..  so there is this George's Gyros, and one on McKellips.  I am a Greek Salad lover so get them often.  Unfortunately i have to say that the George's on McKellips does a much better Greek Salad.  Its 50 cents more, but you get a lot more salad along w/ more peppers, cucumbers and olives.  And they also throw in a yummy piece of garlic bread.  Georges on Scottsdale does have a good salad, it is just not up to par to the one you get from Mckellips.  so!  I am hoping that they will read this and raise the bar a bit :-)"}
{"text":"This place is so delicious. I work nearby and always stop here once a week for lunch. Tried almost everything on menu and everything is delicious. Of course their gyro sandwich is my favorite."}
{"text":"Outstanding food at reasonable prices. I had the gyro platter with dolmas, and all were tasty!  Highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Good solid Mediterranean cuisine - generous portions, both salads and pitas.  All food delicious except the lemon lentil soup, which was a lacking in taste.  It was a tad pricey for a lunch bite. Very friendly service"}
{"text":"This very nice fast casual restaurant is clean, cool and very delicious!   Some of the best Greek food that I have ever had.   Better than what I've had in Greece.   Do yourself a favor and give this place a try...you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"This place is so put together, organized and delicious that I had always thought they were part of a national chain, but they are actually locally- and family-owned!  Big props to the Mikha family!  They have plenty of vegetarian options, and I always make sure to get a side of their lentil soup - it's amazingly delish and fresh tasting!  It's sort of the opposite of George's... :)  Highly recommended and I will always come back!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Great price! You can't go wrong with the Mediterranean style lamb and beef wrap."}
{"text":"I've been here twice this week. The first time I had the gyro and let me tell you... One of the best gyros I've ever had. The meat was piled on and full of flavor, and I love that you can add jalapeños.  I also tried the hummus platter on the first visit. While they give you a good portion of hummus, I would say the flavor is pretty average. It was good but nothing to rave about.  On my second visit I had Mika's fries. AMAZING. Fries covered in gyro meat, Greek dressing, tzatiziki, and feta (I went without the feta.) This would definitely not be on any diet menu. The combined flavors are excellent, and the portion size could feed two people.   The place is clean and the workers are friendly. And they had the NFL draft on the flat screen, which was not what I would have expected at a Greek place - but a huge bonus."}
{"text":"This is a regular place for me to go to lunch. The Mediterranean Chicken Pita is delicious. The chicken is always hot and not dry All sides are good. I usually get Greek salad or Lentil soup"}
{"text":"Great food BUT the clerk, she didn't know anything about the yelp free drink with check-in..and then when we showed it to her she said it PROBABLY isn't for this location. YIKES better do some training. BUT we will return the food is great needs to be spicier on the spicy GYRO thou. I think I prefer the wild guys at the McKellips location"}
{"text":"Mika's Gyro and a side of fries was perfect! The portions were just right and there with a healthy amount of meat and fries that were nice and crispy. I now have a new lunch spot to throw in the Friday rotation. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Well, I have only been here once and I liked it very much. My friend Alan had been here quite a few times, so I thought I would give it a try! It is located in a shopping center on the South West side of Scottsdale road, if that makes it easier to find it. Very simple inside,which is really all it needs to be. We ate outside because, it was a beautiful day. Not too hot yet. We ordered our food and then took a seat outside. Intending to go back in to collect our plates. One of the ladies was nice enough to bring it out to us. I got the gyro and lentil soup. I only got the soup because Alan said he really liked it. I really liked it as well! Very good, as well as very healthy. I did not get the fries because other reviews said they were cold many times. I instead got the Humus which was really good and tasted very fresh. I took a photo of Alan's meal. His was wonderful as well. I want to go back again and check it out some more. The one thing that was a bummer, no hot drinks. such as Hot teas."}
{"text":"I had a pita with gyro meat and it was amazing. It was hot, fresh, and a generous portion. The place itself is really clean, tasteful, and has a lot of seating. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Clean and modern inside. I ordered a grilled chicken plate with a salad on the side. Fresh ingredients, very light, pita bread was nice and warm. Great price for good portioned quality food. Def will come back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service from cashier with dark hair (may be Greek). Super friendly. I've managed in retail for 20 years and rarely have I witnessed such remarkable service. The food was very good... Very tasty and full of meat :-) prices were great and cleanliness was very good. 5 stars all the way around AND 10 to the cashier."}
{"text":"I didn't like it at all food was cooked to much , the price for what you get expensive , never back again"}
{"text":"Amazing Greek food and the employees are always super friendly and helpful! Greekumbers are my fave"}
{"text":"Great Greek food for cheap! It's almost like a Greek Panera. Although, I didn't realize at first that it was an \"order-at-counter\" place and not a waited-service restaurant. The workers did come by ask us how our meal was and took our plates when finished... overall, good experience, just not a real \"restaurant.\""}
{"text":"We tried Mika's for the first time tonight. My husband and I were very impressed.  To start it was very clean! The service was great. I wish I would have taken a picture of our food because the portions were great. I had the beef slovaki plate and my husband had the lamb gyro pita. I will absolutely go back again and would recommend stopping in there."}
{"text":"Great Greek food and amazing service! The staff was so nice and the place was so clean. Ordered the Greek salad with gyro meat and it was perfect! Great portion size and good flavors! I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Love the falafel and hummus plate!!! It was deserted when I went and my food was ready very quickly!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but the food at this casual Greek spot really doesn't hold up to either it's pricing nor the other places around town to eat.   The chicken is as bland tasting as the soup was.  Nice staff unfortunately can't make up for totally mediocre food."}
{"text":"Not quite a fan, unfortunately.   The restaurant is very clean and has many tables for seating. It was empty when we first walked in around 11:30 am, and soon people were bustling for lunch rush. The employees at the counter are helpful when it comes to ordering and suggesting. However, for the type of food, I feel like it's overpriced. I ordered a falafel wrap with fries as my side. The \"wrap\" was gyro style with a pita bread so it was difficult to eat the falafel and enjoy the different sauces spontaneously. I was expecting shawarma style wrap."}
{"text":"Very modern, friendly and fantastic food. I am fortunate to work close by and stop in often. The manager/owner is very friendly. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch.  Great \"fast\" Greek food.  The Greek Sampler was a great way to get a taste of everything.  The hummus was a bit salty, but the tzatziki sauce was amazing.  The vegetarian pita was so filling- large with grilled tomatoes, green peppers and onion.  You have to try the Greek fries- they tasted just like Greek roasted potatoes- with the added zing of some feta on top.  My husband said it tasted like a Greek wedding!  The gyros platter was plenty of food to split between too people.  The toasted pita that came with all meals were delish!  The only downside were the booths- you sink in when you sit- I would suggest some more padding in those or make sure you get a table with chairs."}
{"text":"I've driven past this location for at least a year and always said I need to check them out.  Instead of relying on the same old standard Friday night dinner fare, I picked Mika's to be the night's adventure.  My dinner mate and I ordered the hummus plate, Mika's fries (gyro meat, feta and tzatziki over fries) and gyro pitas with sides.  I could only make it through the appetizers!  The fries are quite possibly my newest addiction.  Everything has bright flavors and no one flavor over powers another.  I look forward to going back and trying the dolmades and lentil soup.  Until then, I still have leftovers for tomorrow's dinner!    Opa!"}
{"text":"Food was not very good for the money. Middle Eastern food is my favorite and this was kinda disappointed."}
{"text":"This place just opened a few months ago along with a few other Greek restaurants in this area. There are now like 5 Greek places within a 2 mile radius of each other. Strange that they all picked this area. I think Mika's is one of the better ones though. The restaurant is also very modern in its look. Nice and clean too. You can see right into their kitchen and watch them shave the meat right off the big roasting block of meat. Their Gyros, the G is silent people, are really good. They add diced tomatoes to their Gyros which I think adds a nice flavor and is different from the usual. At least different form the Gyros I have gotten before. Their fries are pretty good too. Everyone in my office loves this place and every time they have a meeting they send me over here to get them lunch. I don't mind. I will back for sure. Maybe not all the time because it is over $5 for lunch but it is still not bad and their gyros are packed with beef so definitely worth the money. They have other specialty sandwiches that I might try at some point but it is hard to pass up a good Gyro."}
{"text":"Reallly good food! Definitely get the tzatziki sauce - best around. I had the chicken Greek salad, very refreshing and had a lot of chicken!"}
{"text":"This section of Tempe has received a glut of Greek restaurants in the past year. Within a 2 mile radius there's  Niro's, Tzikii's, Café Greco and one other I can't remember the name of.  This place is solid! Yes, they are a little pricey but they are good. Aesthetically speaking this is probably one of the nicest Greek restaurants I've been too, everything is very clean. Their cash register is actually an IPad with Swype attached to it which is a little weird and cool all at the same time. Their side Greek salad is very proudly prepared, I hate when the side Greek salad sucks, but this one had all the fixins (olives, pepperoncini's, onions, feta, tomatoes, cucumbers). The Gyros are made to order, the meat is literally cut right off of the spit in front of you. I can't wait to make my way through the rest of the menu. I think this restaurant will be able to strongly compete against the other Greek restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"When we arrived a diligent young woman was mopping the floors which made me ask if they were closing.  No, she said.  Just cleaning.  And the place looked it.  Sparkling clean throughout.  I hope her boss knows how diligent she is about making the place look and smell clean.  Now to the food.  The way it works is that you go to the counter, order, pay and when it is ready they bring it to you.  We had the small platters which come with one side and pita.  Hubby had the greek chicken with the Greek salad.  I had the chicken souvlaki with french fries.  The greek chicken was chopped up chicken which made it a bit dry.  The Greek salad was good as were the pitas which accompanied each platter.  The chicken souvlaki was more like a shish-kabob, nice and juicy,  so mine was the better of the two dishes.  We also got a small side of yogurt which is traditional to Greek cuisine.   The young lady was friendly, the place was clean and the pricing was fair.  I would choose the chicken souvlaki over the greek chicken anytime.   It's worth a repeat visit."}
{"text":"This neighborhood niche is one of my favorite local restaurants. Give this place a shot people... Good guys...great food..!"}
{"text":"Excellent food in a casual atmosphere. Prices are reasonable and servings generous. I definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"Good quality food. Free WiFi. HiTech iPads for placing orders. Will e-mail or text receipts. A little pricy for a fast food bistro."}
{"text":"Delish and super fresh!! Had a gyro, falafels snd the baclava. Restaurant is immaculate, super impressed with cleanliness."}
{"text":"Very good food. We have had multiple meals all were good. Nice size servings. Service was excellent both times I went in. Right across street from St Joesph hospital. So if you are like me and have a family member here it is a huge help. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  It is clean when you walk in.  Very classy ambience.  The fellas' cooking our meals were happy when they prepared it.  That makes all the difference in the world to see someone put their love into your meal.  The hummus and falafel is delicious. Everything is delicious!  We used to drive 4 miles to get Greek food.  Now we can walk from our house to get it.   Blown away!  Excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Solid selection if meats, salads, hummus, toppings, ect. The service was fast and really quite friendly. They accept credit cards, cash, and even square if you are into that movement. The original gyro and side salad is honestly more than enough food to feed one for dinner. They also have a wheat pita option but you might have to ask. The ambience is clean, quiet, and nice all around. Parking out front is a little hectic but I believe there is more around the back. Enjoy! I know I will be back when I return to Phoenix."}
{"text":"We decided to stop by Mika's Greek after seeing some positive Yelp reviews & I was definitely not disappointed.  I asked the friendly man at the register what he would recommend between the Greek Grilled Chicken pita & the Chicken Souvlaki pita ... he said the Greek Grilled Chicken so I got that with a side of fries. It wasn't busy at all so the food came out really fast and I could tell it was fresh since everything was way too piping hot to be consumed right away.  As for the taste, I'd say it was good. The pita came with diced tomatoes, onions, & their house made tzatziki. The chicken was a bit on the salty side but tasted good with combined with everything else.  I found it to be very clean inside the restaurant too, which was great. It was very modern looking & well maintained. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Don't really eat Greek food as it's not very popular locally.  But I would always try any food at least once.  And I really glad that I came to Mika's one night.  This place was tucked in the very back at a shopping plaza between Scottsdale & Tempe.  It was hard to find at first, but lucky I found this gem in time before they closed for the night.  I ordered Mediterranean Chicken Pita with Fries and my friend ordered Original Tyro Pita, also with Fries.  And since this is Greek food, Falafel appetizer is a must, so we ordered that as well.  The flavoring was very tasty, but I'm still not a fan of this type of food.  But at least I gave it a try, hopefully I\"ll have better review next time."}
{"text":"I was in the area and heard this place was great so I stopped by and had lunch. Got here around 12:30 and they were busy. A great sign to know your gonna get served fresh food. And Fresh Food it was! I had the Picado Pita, the meat was juicy and fresh, perfect amount of spice to the pita. The fries were great, not dropping oil like other places.    The service was very friendly and the food was pretty quick. I recommend this place to everyone. A must try especially if your near by!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews about the café and my aunt and I had to try it. Had the lentil soup and if you like split pea you'll love this! the Souvlaki  chicken pita was good and they don't spare the sauce!! I never had hummus before and the jalepeno hummus has me as a fan. My aunt had a gyros with salad and raved! I don't know if they had any but some baklava & greek coffee would top off meals there. Thumbs-UP"}
{"text":"Had very high hopes for this establishment. First of all my cousin and I came here hungry and ready to eat. Jose the not so friendly cashier kept looking at my chest. I went to sit down with my cousin who had already ordered her food, and got us a booth. I told her that I thought the cashier was creepy and how he kept looking at my chest, she looked at me and said that she thought he was looking at her chest as well.  Aside from that the food portions were a joke. My meat was cold, and it started to upset my stomach. French fries were good, just make sure to bring the salt because these had none!"}
{"text":"Great food and clean. I will come here again. I had the Mikas Fries and the Greek Sampler   Thank you"}
{"text":"Yummy Greek food! I came here for a lunch meeting and definitely enjoyed the gyro wrap with fries.  The restaurant is very clean and the staff is friendly and professional for the most part. The fountain drink machine gives you large selection of sodas to choose from with unlimited refills.   It was my first time there so I wanted to try a nice wrap, but the menu definitely has various salads and other items I will definitely be trying soon. I would recommend this to anyone look for quick and good Greek food!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken gyro and my boyfriend had the lamb gyro platter. The meat was perfect, not overdone at all and was well seasoned. The veggies were fresh. It was reasonably priced especially for the atmosphere and the fact that you get real plates (I like that little detail.) The outdoor seating is a plus too. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Well, what a pleasant little surprise this place turned out to be!  Truth be told, we had headed for a different restaurant nearby and they were unexpectedly closed early on a Saturday - what???  So as we were exiting the parking lot, we saw the sign and said why not? What do we have to lose?  Apparently, the other restaurant's loss was our gain!  This is a great little hidden gem!  We passed on appetizers.  I ordered a Greek chicken platter with Greek salad and the DH had a gyro platter with Greek salad. Then an order of Greek fries...just because. Opa!  First of all, this place is very inexpensive and that is critical to keep in mind during the review.  When the order comes out, it is plated as nicely as a restaurant costing twice as much. They took care to make the platter look attractive. There was a wonderful salad full of nicely fresh and chopped veggies and pepperoncini.  Lightly dressed. And mine was without onions as requested.  The salad was larger than I get in a lot of restaurants as a side order and yummy.  Then came the meats.  Gyro meat is gyro meat - unless you grill the crap out of it, there is not much to distinguish it from another restaurants's so lets just say it was fresh and hot as it should be.  The Greek chicken........yum. Just yum. The breast was nicely marinated and cooked perfectly - not dried out, not crispy on the edges, just cooked perfectly.  Did I mention this was an inexpensive restaurant and yet the care they take with their food beats a lot of $$ restaurants.  The pita came out hot and fresh as well. And the Greek fries were just darned tasty - they were tossed in the house Greek dressing and topped with feta - and I almost had to arm wrestle DH for the last of them and I am not a huge fry eater but these were too fresh and tasty to pass up.  And - side note on the fries - despite the fact that they were tossed with a little dressing, they were not limp and soggy.  They knew exactly how to prepare them to keep them from turning into a hot mess.  In all honesty - I could not even finish my platter!  And it was so good, I tried - and I took those leftovers home and did NOT split them with the pup!  Kudos to Mika's - we will be back again despite the fact that I can find closer Greek restaurants.  You are worth the drive!  Scorecard: Cleanliness - 5 stars Price - 5 stars Quality - 5 stars Portions - 5 stars  What's not to like???"}
{"text":"Placed a delivery order and when it arrived I was missing food.  Fine.  But when I called I had to ask for a refund because they didn't offer to bring the food!  No dinner for me I guess.  Had this restaurant had halfway decent customer service, we would have been regulars.  Unfortunately first impressions last.  Thumbs down."}
{"text":"We ordered for deliver for three people.  $40 with delivery not too bad for the amount of food we got.  We find that they are the most flavorful and best value.  So far ordered 5 times and no disappointments!   This is my third review and so far still impressed!!!"}
{"text":"We are from the western suburbs of Chicago my husband and I think this food is better than any Greek restaurant.  I order the Greek chicken platter side of Greek salad and he order the gyros platter outstanding food with great customer service"}
{"text":"Really great restaurant! Very clean and has a more sophisticated vibe than other basic Greek restaurants. Friendly staff and the pita options are awesome! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great ambience. Nice decor and pleasant environment. Tasty food, nice service. Huge options to choose from. One of the nice Greek restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"So to start with this restaurant is very clean and impeccable, when you walk in you can see into the kitchen and see how your food is being prepared, which is always good. Also, the gentleman there told me they get their produce locally sourced, which is another good sign.  I ordered the Greek sampler with Dolmas, hummus, falafel and tzatiki to go. It is supposed to have pita but I am Gluten sensitive so they added extra cucumber instead. The meal was quickly prepared and I was on my way.    I didn't get to eat it while it was piping hot, but that was my fault. What I can tell you is the dolmas was nicely spiced, and very filling even without meat, which is how I was used to eating them. The hummus was very good too. You could taste the freshness. And the falafel which in my experience tends to be a little dry, dipped in hummus or tzatiki was very tasty.   I will be back, I look forward to trying more of the meals and think this Greek restaurant franchise concept, if they can all prepare food this well will be a great addition."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since before it was Mikas and they always do a good job!  I wish the prices were a bit lower, but the place is big and I would assume its a fairly high-rent area. That aside I have never had a bad meal here, the portions are good, and you all know I love my Gyros!  The service is fast, and the food is fresh, they have plenty of seating and the ambiance is nice."}
{"text":"Greek food is on the top of my list so I can be a bit critical. With that said, this place is incredible. Service is always great and the food even better. Authentic high quality Greek food. Try the Picado Pita or the Greeks fries. Def won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I felt like trying something new and I live right by Mikas.I have driven by thinking I need to try that place since I love Greek food. I tried it today and it was amazing. I had the original gyro and it was loaded with meat and it was perfectly cooked. I also had the jalapeño hummus and Greek wings. All were excellent. The restaurant was also very clean and nice. I called in my order and it was ready when I got there. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"thought i'd try this place since its so near work but this is definitely the first and only time i'll go to Mika's. i ordered the gyro platter ($12.95) with fries and salad. at first glance this price is a little steep compared to other greek restaurants in the area ($8.95 or $9.95). with a drink my lunch came to about $16. a little high but i figured i'd give this place a shot.   i ordered to go and had to wait for about 20 min before my food was ready. i was a little disappointed to see the size of the portions (this is a $16 lunch meal...). getting this back to the office and digging in, i'm equally saddened by the just average taste. the fries are not salted or crispy, the salad is bland, and the meat ... well it was definitely not plentiful and definitely not seasoned enough.  all in all a really disappointing experience. YC's or jimmy john's will be getting my business when i turn into that plaza."}
{"text":"A random stop for a great lunch. This was a unique place that offered about eight ways to enjoy your lunch pita and basically get free fries or rice with your meal. Most pita's were about 8 bucks. I chose the chicken which was marinated in some heavy garlic and spices and thrown on a pita with feta and other stuff. The strips of chicken were well seasoned and all white meat and it was a good eating experience. The fries could have been a tad crispier, but otherwise a good side dish choice. All packed to go and it was still hot after a 20 minute drive home."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service, fresh Greek salad, comfortable open atmosphere, a great place for lunch."}
{"text":"WOW! I chose this place because I read a few nice reviews... Guess what, those reviews lied!! My husband and I walked into this very \"tecky\" style place. (next to Jimmy Johns which is where we should have gone) They have menus on flat panel TVs and a very neat ipad looking checkout counter. We went to a booth to wait for our food and had a different setting then normal. The booths are VERY wide. When we got our food it was awkward to eat because the seat is farther from the table then it should be.(The table does move, but still is not planned well for groups/couples to sit across from each other) We were sitting on the edges of the booth and still leaning to eat.Now for the food we did get... We both ordered gyros, my husband got the soup and I got the salad. The soup was so bland and tasteless we could not figure out what it was. The texture was weird too. I caved and asked the girl what it was and she said it was lentil soup. I don't know where hey got their recipe, but it needs revised. My salad was dressed with a dressing that wasn't shaken, it was very oily and also bland. The gyros had nice pita bread, but that was it. They are not shy on the amount of meat you get, but it has no flavor either!! The tatziki was very watery and the tomatoes not ripe yet. All in all, the food is substance and that is about it."}
{"text":"Best Greek food I have had in the valley. Great service, beautiful/modern decor, fancy technology for credit cards, the coke machine with approximately 3848382 options AND Gold Peak tea. Oh, and yummy-tastic food, too.   Original Gyro and Greek fries are where it's at. The salad is good and friends have told me the chicken gyro is tasty. Even when busy(swamped during noon hour), food comes out quickly and they bring it to you based on your receipt number. When on my hour lunch break, we would have 1/2 hour to spare when we went at an off time 11 or 1:30. Wish they had more seating but, hey, it's a small building. Try it. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'm crazy for Mika's Greek. So far i have had the Caesar and the  diablo Caesar pitas. They are both so yummy. The pita bread always tastes so fresh with  grilled chicken that is seasoned just so.  For sides i have had the rice and also paid a bit more for the Greek fries which are topped with chunks of feta and drizzled with a vinaigrette (which they put on the side for to orders so they don't get soggy in the bag- smart). They are so tasty and different then #BasicBitchFries. I've been telling all my friends to go for awhile now so needed to write a review to tell the Yelpians to go!"}
{"text":"Well laid out, well lit, comfortable, clean, and professional and friendly service. AND AMAZING FOOD. I feel the desert was lacking though. I'm no expert but the baklava tasted old or over done. The pastry layer was really dry, airy, and flaky and the bottom layer was hard and chewy. The flavor was like baklava I've had before so I will likely give it a better look next time before I try the baklava again as I will be back.   It could have just been that the day ate here, the oven broke and the baklava was burnt. The menu is simple and offers and great assortment of options in food and beverages. I'm a stickler for good service so where Mika's Greek would usually get 5 stars, I wish I could give 7 1/2 stars for everything else."}
{"text":"Close to work. Easy and fast. Will go back.  Don't need to write more just because I think it's simply good.  RL"}
{"text":"I had their food at an event that was catered, and it was pretty good. Not impressed with anything at the actual restaurant though. The chicken was over seasoned and dry, the rice tasted old and was hard, and the gyro meat was not tasty at all.  But, the prices are low and the staff was very friendly..."}
{"text":"My go to spot if I'm looking for a quick healthy option. Food is tasty with great quality ingredients. Not your typical greasy late night Greek spot. The restaurant itself was recently remodeled and very cute inside and service is always very fast."}
{"text":"Tremendous food and service. Quick, delicious, and healthy. Great music as well, I heard the yeah yeah yeah's while eating chicken souvlaki on my lunch break one day and it was tremendous."}
{"text":"Not the best chicken. It appears to be pre-cut chicken strips and they are not marinated well or seasoned. Edible, but not the best chicken that could be used. Side salad is kinda tiny as well with hardly any feta cheese present in a greek salad. Plus the pita did not hold up well to-go. It steamed itself in the plastic and came out steamed, wet and clammy. Second time not the charm."}
{"text":"I had the Greek salad pita it was fantastic.  I have to say that I was not a big fan of how large the cucumbers were sliced but that didn't take away from the flavor! The staff was very nice and the place is very clean!"}
{"text":"Yum! The food is great, the restaurant is clean and the team was friendly and quick! The menu provides various options and being close to work is a plus as well. I highly recommend the Picado Pita.. Your traditional gyro with a kick of jalapeño!"}
{"text":"Best Greek restaurant in the 3 mile area. Ordered the chicken and gyro plate. Portions on the plates were very good. Enough left over to make breakfast with some eggs. Hummus was also good. Prices were reasonable. Ordered carry out through the Yelp app. Order was ready on time. Didn't dine in but the restaurant looked clean and nice. Has the new style of soda machine that does the flavor add ins."}
{"text":"Mika's Greek is one of the best. Always fresh and plenty of options. i've had their chicken, the lamb and the beef and all three are really great. It never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Mika's Greek's is an extremely clean 'n tidy counter service cafe serving a simple menu of Greek standards. The lunchtime staff (same two guys that always seem to be working) are friendly and efficient. The food is spot on in the fresh department....not greasy or heavy! Mika's Greek is a solid stop for lunch! I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I used to like this place ok... Even though right when you walk in you smell sewage(ever since it opened). They changed their menu around and I ordered beef souvlaki and chicken($14 for 1 meal). Their hummus is subpar. The thing that was disgusting was the beef souvlaki. I have eaten at many Mediterranean restaurants and every one of them serve grilled beef chunks as souvlaki. Then they have a ground beef sausage/long hamburger patty called beef kafta.  The chicken souvlaki here is grilled pieces of chicken. So I open up my meal when I get home and the \"souvlaki\" is a long poop looking herbed hamburger patty. Ewwwwwwwww. Not going back. False advertising. Overpriced as well."}
{"text":"Love this place! The best Greek food. Everything is so fresh while still quick and affordable. They always have awesome specials and offer large portions. Happy to say we have become regulars here! Make sure to try the Tzatziki...mmm delicious!"}
{"text":"I kind of oscillated between 3 and 4 stars, and decided on 4 stars for the overall experience.  The food overall was probably 3 stars.  Very nice shop.  Nice and clean, modern, and a very friendly lady working at the counter.  Free WiFi, too.  I asked a couple of questions about the menu and she gave me the info I needed, then I ordered.  I got the gyro with a side salad and a drink, all for $10.77.  Good price.  Free refills on sodas with a self-serve fountain station.  Plenty of extra parking behind the store with a rear entrance.  One thing I wish it had more of was sauce, both for the salad and the cucumber sauce for the gyro.  Everything tasted fine but I did wish I had asked for some extra on the side.  The gyro itself is typical, but I'm a bit spoiled.  My favorite place has large, soft strips of meat so I'm a bit disappointed by the places that serve the thinner, harder strips.  It tends to make the dish feel a bit average.  If you want to stand out you have to do something different.  But like I said, the place and experience was good overall.  I enjoyed eating there and I'll return."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Every ingredient is delicious and even better together. I got the grilled Greek chicken with rice and tztaziki platter. The pita is also soft and perfect. I highly recommend! This place is my new Greek go to!"}
{"text":"Stopped in a few weeks ago while visiting the Scottsdale area.  Food was good, not great, service was good.  Not a bad place at all, just not a wow must try spot, but if you are in the area & in the mood for Greek I would not hesitate to try Mika's"}
{"text":"We've been a few times to Mika's Grill and we haven't been disappointed.  Usually we order gyro or chicken and with the sides it's just enough food to fill us up.  I would recommend Mika's to anyone.  Very Good!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we will definitely come back!  The food was very good, the dining room was very clean price was great for the amount of food we received! The Greekumbers were very yummy!"}
{"text":"Fast delicious Mediterranean food that you'll love.  Great place for lunch when you are limited on time.   I had the gyros platter with side salad for $7.95, lots of meat and sprinkled with feta cheese."}
{"text":"I personally live down the street. I love this place. They really have a great menu. There fast and friendly and to be honest you really can't beat the service here! If I was looking for the food again I would definitely come here."}
{"text":"Easy 5 stars. The food is really good for the price! Adding Sriracha to greek food is so delicious and the Diablo Pita was ridiculously good. Daniel, who worked here (Manager maybe?), was really friendly and the service was awesome. I had a diablo pita with chicken and a greek salad and they were both awesome. I would highly recommend this place for some quick greek deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Given it was 8:10pm when we called in our pick-up order, I guess I would expect the quality, but my boyfriend and I were hoping for more since we paid $30 for our meal. We ordered a gyro and greek chicken plate with fries and a salad in addition to a chicken souvlaki wrap, mediterranean style with fries and a couple drinks. Our hot fries were placed next to cold veggies in plastic to go containers that don't seem heat safe; fries were soggy and otherwise lacking. I got two hunks of whole chicken breast and a few slices of pickle and onion with a weak spread of sauce, not what I had in mind. My boyfriend was disappointed his large plate didn't come with pita, and that his \"greek\" chicken was no different from my chicken \"souvlaki.\" All in all, we thought we'd try something new, and it disappointed. I get it, an hour til close on a Monday night, but come on, slice the chicken."}
{"text":"When we received food it was cold.  I'm from Chicago so having the gyro and the chicken has to be the disgusting thing I've tasted.   I will not go here again or recommend this place to anyone! This has got to be the worst Gyro and Chicken I've ever had in my life."}
{"text":"This is a new find for us. We really like it! The food is good, really fresh. The soup they serve is amazing ,a type of yellow Lentil soup. Hummus is a big Yes. Very good as well. I would come here whenever I could. You can eat inside or outside. Good prices and good Food.  Easy to get to  as well. Right in the shopping center on the South-West corner of Scottsdale Road and McDowell."}
{"text":"While the food wasn't what I am used to when it comes to Greek food , the restaurant was very nice, clean and the service was amazing"}
{"text":"Visiting from California. Love Greek. I had another Greek/Mediterranean while I was here. Mika's was much better quality and the service was speedy. For the price it is Definitely one of the best Greek restaurants I have tried. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Nice little place with nice people. Tried jalapeño hummus, large palate with grilled Greek chicken and falafel. Food is awesome! Would be perfect if a couple more beverage options are there."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times before and even ordered it to-go to take back home with me! The Mediterranean pita is delicious, absolutely in LOVE with the Greek fries, and the chicken caeser one is pretty good too! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome the only issue is sometimes an older lady works there and wears bright lip stick she can be a bit stuck up! But everyone other then her is super down to earth. The food is amazing it's our favorite Greek restaurant!"}
{"text":"Just like the Mika's next to my office in Scottsdale. Very clean, extremely friendly, and excellent food per usual. Get the diablo! The sariacha makes it killer. Also, not sure how they do it, but the fries are better than any I've had anywhere."}
{"text":"It's okay.  French fries were a disappointment.  They were soggy.  The gyro was average. I would come back to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Greek night club is sooooo good! Fresh vegetables and awesome feta. The rice is a little bland but good salads. Also... Siracha on tap! First time I've seen this"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch with a co-worker the other day and left happy that we found this place. It was clean, affordable, and the service was quick. I had a chicken pita that was delicious. The Greek fries were yummy and I found myself trying to copy them at home. My co-worker had the lentil soup and the chicken platter and said it was excellent."}
{"text":"The food was good although it was pretty expensive for what you get. The issue we really had was how rude the cashier girl was to us. She acted like we ruined her night by coming in late and seemed so annoyed when we ordered an extra hummus when we got there. I probably will look for another place"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and its amazing. We tried the Mika's Fries with gyro and it was amazing. The portion is good for two. Food was fresh and yummy. The atmosphere is really cool and the restaurant is clean. I recommend this place to friends and neighbors."}
{"text":"Yummy Greek food to satisfy all your Mediterranean cravings.  Simple, busy and clean place to grab a bite."}
{"text":"We love this place!  I work at ASU Skysong and my coworkers and I frequent this shop for lunch.  The service is always great, the food is good and the baklava is to die for!  We also have them cater for our office on occasion and they have never disappointed.  Definitely a good place to check out."}
{"text":"Chicken, gyro and flafel, was over cooked and flavorless. For this quality of food, it was way over priced and not edible at all."}
{"text":"Really, really clean as other reviewers have stated. Building used to be sushi eye. I got the chicken souvlaki pita platter with side salad. Everything was really fresh. No complaints to speak of!"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times, finally getting around to writing the review. I love MIKA's. Service is always fast and attentive. Food is always fresh and hot. I typically do the Mediterranean pita or Greekpeño with chicken. The Greek fries are so delicious and have the right amount of feta cheese. Whenever I crave pita, I come here."}
{"text":"Holy bananas! I just tried this place as a recommendation from people I work with...amazing! Service was relatively fast as I walked in and ordered to go. Everything smelled amazing and my food tasted so good!"}
{"text":"We eat there a few times a month, food & service is always outstanding.  The place is very clean, they have a few tables out front.  Not much else in the old Papago Plaza, so lots of parking.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is really nice and clean inside.  I ran inside to order my food and the cashier (I think her name was Amy?) helped me out.  I paid and ran back to my car that was still running because my dog was inside.  I usually never take him with me in the summer but the power was out in my neighborhood and it was too hot to leave him home.  I explained my situation to the lady at the counter.  Anywho, I saw her pack my food...and then she brought it out to me.  I know this is a simple act, but it really means a lot to me when someone takes an extra step to make your day easier or better.  The chicken was amazing!!  But I mostly give 5 stars for the customer service!! I will be back soon!! Thanks Amy :)"}
{"text":"I ordered pick up and my partner went and got the food. We live very close and when she got home the food was still hot and might I say very yummy! Since this was our first visit we played it safe with a gyro and side salad and the greekumbers. Wow! Needless to say we will be back. Would be great if you all delivered as I am home with an injury and would love to have your food more frequently."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here for lunch during the work week for a quick and somewhat healthier option. The chicken and gyro are always tasteful and fresh, however I am not very fond of their side options. The rice is very bland and has zero flavor which is unfortunate considering their chicken and gyro are both tasty. It's a great local spot for a quick bite but can easily be forgotten about."}
{"text":"I was in the area when I had a sudden craving for Greek food.  I had the small platter with beef souvlaki.  $7.95. Delicious!  I wouldn't get the large unless you're sharing or super hungry. Lots of food.  Very clean and new inside."}
{"text":"It's a hit or a miss. I have been when they served great food and unfortunately I have also been here while receiving terrible service and food from the meat head at the counter. My gf was appalled that the Caesar salad had lettuce, old cheese and drenched in Caesar dressing. I feed animals in a more humane manner lol. Never going here again!"}
{"text":"Quick place to grab a quick bite to eat in Central Phoenix.   Nice staff and good food at a reasonable price.  I enjoyed the dolma platter with a greek salad and rice.  It was the perfect portion, flavorful and freshly made."}
{"text":"Great! Great! Great! I ordered enough to have leftovers, however it was so good, i couldn't help myself and ate it all. The whole menu is a go."}
{"text":"Had original gyros and a Greek salad. Loved it. Very fresh. And the Greek dressing was perfect. I'll come back and try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Chicken souvlaki plate. Chicken terrible. Fatty. Undercooked. Rice absolutely tasteless. Pita was fine. No reason to give this a second try. Ewww"}
{"text":"Grabbed a gyro and a tea for lunch. Restaurant was clean, staff was kind, lots of folks eating there when I showed up. Price was average for a gyro, I would go back."}
{"text":"This place is fresh, fast and delicious. It's a breath of fresh air for Greek food. A must visit when you have the hankering."}
{"text":"This small unassuming strip mall restaurant is a five star gem. Several co-workers had been there and came back raving, so yesterday we went as a group. Going with five people let me see the awesome quality across five different plates. We all had something different and all enjoy generous portions of quality food. Perfectly cooked meats, not over seasoned served, with various sides for under $10 each.   The service was also perfect. You order at the counter where they will eagerly answer questions or accommodate requests. They then bring out your delicious plate soliciting feedback and ensuring your enjoyment.   You can't go wrong with great service, quality food, generous portions, and reasonable prices. Mika's delivers squarely on all points and earns my five star review."}
{"text":"This place is horrific. Customer service is horrible. The only plus since weve dined there a couple times was a very nice young blonde girl was so friendly and was a asset to this company and i have not seen here recently but I will no longer spend another penny in this place. This owner is absolutely in the clouds with what is going on in their facility."}
{"text":"From the service, to the soups, to the salads and main dishes this place is one to put on the list! You will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Great little Greek restaurant! The staff is friendly and welcoming. Stumbled upon this place through groupon and really glad I did! Their gourmet gyros was amazing!!!! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place. I order the Greek salad and Euro and have had a few other items here as we'll. All have been very good. The people here are always very friendly and provide good service. As far as the price, its very similar to many other Greek restaurants I've visited. Great healthy food and worth every penny."}
{"text":"My new go to Greek spot!  I live walking distance away and I'm glad I finally checked this place out. Everyone was so friendly, the place was clean, and the food was amazing. Will come back for sure"}
{"text":"So. Darn. Good. Randomly happened across this place yesterday (moved my daughter into a condo nearby). The food here is amazing. I had a Greek salad with chicken and my mom had the diablo pita  with chicken. Everything was fresh, prepared to order and absolutely delicious. I should have taken pics but I was so hungry I couldn't wait!  I will go back every time I visit my daughter. The owners were so nice and treated us as if we were visiting their home. Go here. You will be glad you did."}
{"text":"No flavor to the food. I had to pour hot sauce all over it (which is not normal for me and Greek food) just to taste something. There is much better Greek food in town!!"}
{"text":"The falafel is delicious and fresh. The Mediterranean pita is delicious. The tziki and hummus are great. Try the Greek fries. You won't be sorry. The service was good and the people were friendly. Everything was clean and welcoming. Put Mika's in your mouth."}
{"text":"We have been here more then a couple times and each time is very satisfying. I always get the chicken pita wrap with fries and my husband gets the lamb wrap. Prices are reasonable and I like the convenient area. We prior to us finding this location we would go to the one by scottsdale and McDowell rd."}
{"text":"Visiting Downtown Phx, us Mesa folks had no idea where to find good Greek food in the area. So we googled and still.. we got lost. Randomly driving to find a freeway, disappointed and hungry.. we saw in the corner of our eye this tiny beautiful white house with a cute patio for diners. We saw GREEK FOOD.  Ordered the gyro sandwich meal.. Super good!!  Cute restaurant, nice atmosphere, Amazingly great food and End of story!"}
{"text":"This place lacks authenticity and consistency! I understand the current owners are not Greek's but that should not stop them from making some delicious Greek food if invested. The price range is ok but the quality of poor is poor."}
{"text":"Mika's was great! Not only the food was great and very reasonable, staff is friendly and knowledgable about everything on the menu. The owner is right there in the front  talking to the customers, I will definately be back!"}
{"text":"This review requires very little, All I want to say is you have to eat here. Me and my wife are frequent customers and we recommend Mika's Greek to everyone we know. The food is absolutely amazing, like the melt in your mouth chicken souvlaki is a must. They also have the valleys #1 Greek salad in my opinion. Defiantly go for dinner tonight :-)"}
{"text":"Gyro platter was a decent size portion for lunch. Our food came out quick but then again we were the only customer. I'm usually Leary about eating at a place with no customers but I can say food was good and don't know why they don't have a large customer base right across from a large hospital."}
{"text":"The gyro sandwich and Greek salad were excellent. Looking forward to coming back in the future."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's just down the road from my house and I always order the original with fries and my girlfriend gets the same.  Always take 10 minutes to prepare and always fresh!  Highly recommend this place to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"I went to their website and ordered online. I set the location as the one on Southern and Mill. But for some reason it sent the order to the Elliot store. Now I have to drive all the way across town to pick up food that I put in at a different store. The guy at the store I went to was rude. And now my food will be cold when I finally get to the other side of Tempe to pick it up I will never order from here again"}
{"text":"I happened to see this restaurant today and decided to go in. I LOVE Greek food. I had a pita with gyros and some Basmati rice. It was truly delicious. The only thing, that I really did not care for, was the 2 big pieces of pickles in there, which was really no big deal, since I took them out.. The rice was very good as well.Amy, the server was very friendly.  I can truly recommend this restaurant with the best of conscience!"}
{"text":"This is a perfect place for some quick and satisfying Greek food. It's not the highest quality or does not have the best ambience, yet it is very convenient. You get to choose your sides as well, soup, salad, fries!"}
{"text":"Mikas is the best Greek food in town. The customer service is always awesome. I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Lately, I've been craving Greek food. And lucky for me, I've had a few opportunities in recent weeks to partake. Today, lunch at Mika's Greek was suggested by one of the quieter \"culinary co-horts\". I had no idea this awesome little joint was hiding in my backyard at the south end of Papago Plaza! Mika's is clean, modern and comfortable. They even have a Coke Freestyle dispenser. More on that later.  True to form, I ordered something \"gyro\" related. My Gyro Platter (with one meat and one side) was a generous portion and very reasonable for less than eight dollars. Lunch was filling, healthy and so tasty! I'm glad I was a creature of habit today, because it made it easier to make a decision in the face of so many options.  Now about that soda machine... Right after one of my co-workers filled his drink, the touch screen indicated that nearly all the choices were unavailable. All I had at this point was a cup of ice. An employee tried to fix this by re-booting the machine. She also offered me a bottle of Coke as an option. I declined and waited patiently, returning two more times, only to find the screen slowly re-booting. When the dispenser was working again, it was still missing about 80% of the options. However, I managed to dispense a surprisingly good Cherry Mello Yello Zero. Random, huh?  Unfortunately, when I returned for a refill, the machine looked like it was working properly, but my Cherry Coke was flat... I can't deduct a star, even after that. The food at Mika's was too good! See you again soon!"}
{"text":"Very good, fresh salad. Chicken perfectly spiced."}
{"text":"Ordered the Mediterranean Chicken pita and the thin sliced chicken is dry and french fries were over cooked or sitting around for awhile. They were soggy in the middle. My second experience like this. Friendly and clean place but pitas are average. \"King of Gyros\" on Warner is way better. Just a honest review. Throw out fries if they are not fresh. Bad fries can kill the deal."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have a delicious Greek salad and I always add Greek chicken. It's wonderful and a good size salad. Their Greek fries are out of this world too!"}
{"text":"Just check this place out today.  upon walking in I noticed the place is immaculately clean, well-designed and functional for big or small groups.  The guy behind the counter who made the food  was super nice and friendly.  I ordered the gyro special with side Mediterranean salad Salad was super fresh, perfect amount of dressing. Gyro meat was perfectly shaved right off fresh.. tender moist. the pita was also moist and perfect. Ziki sauce was on point as well.     Will definitely return"}
{"text":"The service was very nice! I haven't really eaten Greek food before and the last was really nice explaining the differences between the meals. I'd liked it a lot"}
{"text":"I love Mika's Greek!! It is Always fresh and the prices are just right. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Mika's was super fast and friendly. The food is good. We got the gyro salads. Definitely want to try the Jalapeno Hummus! Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I discovered them by going to Jimmy John's and then deciding on them instead since they are next door. Glad I did. I can never turn down Greek food. Everything here is delicious. I usually get the Chicken Souvlaki Pita with a Greek Salad. Amazing. I have never been disappointed. I really like that when I pay with my card I can earn stars, and after 10 meals I get one free. Wonderful staff, always smiling and very friendly. Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"Great place to pick up a flatbread sandwich and salad for lunch. The food is a great value, and always great service."}
{"text":"The food was tasty but I don't think I'll be back. The guy who took my order wasn't that friendly. It's a little pricey for a fast food lunch.  I got the 2 item combination plate with the drink and it was $16.95. Who can afford that at lunch? Also the plates slide all over the because the tables are so slippery."}
{"text":"Always fast and fresh. One of my favorite Mediterranean place, their gyro platter with greek salad is a must. You get the tasty marinated meat, warm bread and very generous and healthy salad for a reasonable price. Add to that the very fast service,  and the large choice of beverages from the dispenser, you get a perfect place to have a quality lunch. Also the restaurant is always very clean and well maintained."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover, considering this is in Papago Plaza. Mikas Greek is very nice inside, with a modern twist. The food is always fresh and the customer service is on point."}
{"text":"Went last month on a weekday afternoon.  We timed it perfectly to arrive post-lunch rush, and were looking for meatless options that provide ample fill up.  The food portions are great, everything's fresh and the staff is friendly.  Will definitely be back, maybe for dinner next time."}
{"text":"I've stopped by Mika's a couple times to eat in and take out. The menu has great variety and have yet to find an item I didn't like! Good price, friendly staff, and wonderful food. I'd recommend for a quick lunch and definitely try all the hummus/dips."}
{"text":"They had awesome food at an affordable price. We paid just under 8 bucks and got a large overflowing Gyro and it came with a side. I got a whole bowl of lentil soup. It definitely didn't disappoint! Wish we had some places like this near me."}
{"text":"I was surprised by this little place! Saw them pop up about a month or so ago. Nice to have another place open on Saturdays close to my neighborhood as most are closed weekends. Decor is clean and modern, customer service was good, and food was done quickly. I was happy to see they cooked and prepared everything while I waited so it was fresh. I orded a greek chicken platter with rice and salad as my sides. Chicken was flavorful and moist, rice was perfectly tender and spiced, salad was fresh and had the right amount of everything. I was happy their tziki sauce was light and creamy and the pita was fluffy. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not to be confused by the George's Gyros on Mckellips and Miller.  This location is definitely a bar above that one.  The restaurant itself is very clean, air conditioned, and pleasant to be inside.  TV's are present to keep you entertained while you dine-in, or wait for your take-out order.  It was a little hard to find, as it's on the backside of Papago Plaza, I didn't even know this place was there until I found myself lost, and starving.  The food is pretty standard Greek food.  Delicious gyros, greek salad, etc., more often than not delivered by a Greek god of an owner.  It's nearly worth going to this place just to see him."}
{"text":"We thought the food was great here. Fresh and priced right. The sampler plate was generous and delicious. The chicken skewers and salad were very good also. Sat outside but the inside was nice too.  I'd say this place is worth going back to often!"}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious and conveniently quick! I've been twice and the food/service is consistently top notch. The \"Chipotle\" of Greek food"}
{"text":"Great. Quick accurate and always good. I like the whole menu. The desserts are really sweet and really good"}
{"text":"wow went into mika's today 3-9-17 and was going to use a coupon I have from my Verizon smart rewards program, but didn't have a printer to print up the coupon. after a mixup the owner hooked me up with the same coupon which he didn't have to do but he showed his professionalism and took care of it. the food was top notch, had the picado pita with rice and was delicious not to mention the baklava. please, if you are in tempe near mill and southern and want something different, give Mika's a shot you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Always fresh and tasty. Great service.  Greekumbers and Greek chicken platter are tops!"}
{"text":"Best greek food around my work and when I'm craving a Gyro, but can't get to Haji Baba. Food comes out quick. The pitas have massive amounts of meat and come with a side. Get the salad or soup (lentils) and you'll be super pleased. My friends say the fries and rice are also great."}
{"text":"Awesome and tasty food. Quick and fresh with a take out feel even taken in house. Friendly service. Clean and open environment. Suggest lunch here."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere. Attentive service even though you order from the counter. Food fresh and tasty; delightful quantities adequate. I will be returning. The location is excellent and easy."}
{"text":"Haven't had time to write a dazzling 5 start review of this place yet but after my delicious hummus plate, I figured I may as well. Every time I walk into this place I am greeted by smiling face that seem genuinely happy to be at their job. The owner is always around and is also very pleasant. This is one of the cleanest places I have ever eaten, you can tell the employees and owner take great pride in their appearance because this place is sparkling. The food is delicious, the BEST Greek in Tempe. GO FOR THE JALAPEÑO HUMMUS, you'll never go back to pita jungle."}
{"text":"Mikas Greek is awesome!  The food is the bomb and the service and ambience was exceptional. We went to the MK on Mill and Southern last night and all I can say is Welcome to the Neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I really liked this restaurant. Food was fresh and had great flavors. I loved the cucumber salad and I can't wait to go back and have it again!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting arizona from California and i wanted to try something new. Stopped by here and didn't know what to try, but the manager was sooooooo helpful he helped me order and was very attentive making sure that me and my girlfriends were satisfied. The service is quick and the restaurant was by far the cleanest place around."}
{"text":"One of the cleanest restaurants I have visited in a while.  Gyro was amazing and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Me and the hubby got take out here for dinner. He got Mika ' s fries which were amazing and definitely worth 5.95! I got a falafel pita with side Greek salad. Both were yummy! Our total was just $15. Has a good atmosphere ans modern decor. We would totally go back again. Sad they don't have Greek lemon chicken soup though."}
{"text":"I love a good Gyro and this place makes them AMAZING! I ordered a traditional Gyro to go and was out the door in less than 5 minutes (good for my lunch break). I plan on going again for lunch today!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great atmosphere! And great staff! 5 stars is an understatement. I would recommend this place to everyone!!! Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!!"}
{"text":"The jalapeño hummus was brilliant and they have delicious and authentic yellow basmati rice. The lemon Soup was rich and spicy. The only thing that could improve is the tzatziki sauce portion, it is very yummy but there is very little given, especially for the price of an individual side sauce. It would also be nice if the Greek fries came with tzatziki dip. Maybe they forgot to add it?   Great pita sandwiches, we had the beef Diablo and the chicken souvlaki. Have been here several times since it opened and have always had friendly and accommodating service."}
{"text":"My wife is greek. I love greek food. She is hyper critical of any greek fod beyond her own or her mothers. So I don't get to eat it very often, unless she cooks it. I finally convinced her to try this place. Granted it's fast greek. And some items on the menu are middle eastern, not really greek, but that's ok. The tzaziki, a true measure of any greek food, was surprisingly good. I was also impressed with the dolmades. The veggie gyro though needed a bit more feta to make the taste more authentic.  Overall, a good experience for greek food. There are plenty of options for all palates, including a kids menu."}
{"text":"Okay, just yes. Mikas is awesome, I love the modern update they made to the inside of the restaurant last year.   The food is so good!! I love the euro meat but the chicken is great too. Last night, I tried the Diablo wrap and it was the perfect amount of spicy. The Greek fries are an absolute must- fresh French fries with Greek dressing and feta cheese. I mean, feta cheese and French fries, obviously it's good.  The employees are friendly and it's quick and fresh. I really recommend! It's in the plaza off McDowell and sky song road. check it out!"}
{"text":"This place overcharges for a very small portion of food I order a fries and a gyro the fries portion is very small and the gyro itself is small I order a drink and it came out to $14 not worth it"}
{"text":"For a quick work lunch we decided to give Mika's a try.  I could not have been more pleased with our choice.  They have a very nice menu selection.  I ordered the gyro platter.  The food was fresh, flavorful, well seasoned and the right temperature.  We were 5 people and our food came out very quickly and all at about the same time.  I will definitely visit again the next time I travel to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great gyros! The meat is not dry and is flavorful. Their appetizers are delicious and great for sharing.   The place was clean and is usually not busy at all. Both times I went now.. The second time had a really grumpy looking server. The music playing was very odd. Will go if I'm in the area and in the mood but would not drive for it."}
{"text":"Definitely authentic and that is what I like most.  The food has that genequesa that just soothes the palate. Great comfort food."}
{"text":"Great value, great customer service, and great food.  I get the greek night club, add chicken!"}
{"text":"Yummy greek food, really liked it! I was looking for a place near old town with not too pricey food and Mika's Greek sounded like a good option! My boyfriend is not too adventurous when it comes to food and trying new restaurants, but he liked this place a lot and told me he'd like to come back.  It's kind of in a weird location, we went at night and had a bit of trouble finding it right away. Also there was a person being arrested directly in front of Mika's Greek which freaked us out a bit! There weren't too many people inside, we didn't have to wait to order which was nice. I ended up getting the appetizer platter with extra falafel with no domaldes. I asked if I could get rice instead of domaldes but she said you can only really ask for more falafel. Wasn't too expensive, and was a large quantity of food! My boyfriend went for the chicken with fries (one meat one side) plate. It also came with pita and tzatziki. My platter had falafel, pita, hummus, and tzatziki. It was really good! The hummus had a great texture and flavor. Tzatziki was a bit too garlicky for me, left me with smelly breath, but it was good! The falafel had a good flavor to it, I liked it a lot. I'd be happy to come back!"}
{"text":"I found Mika's on Yelp. I decided to try it out because people mentioned the large portions. I ordered the Greek Night Club with chicken souvlaki with the side salad. The side salad was normal size; however, the pita was packed with large pieces of chicken, lots of tztatziki, feta, and veggies. It was so big I had to ask for another pita. I love both of their ice teas. As an after thought I ordered a half order of falafel. They taste freshly made and had the perfect spice. Definitely worth the money. Friendly staff. They even brought the food to the table when I ordered at the counter. I would have given them 5 stars but they did charge for me to add Greek pickles to my pita and they will charge extra for tztatziki. All in all, excellent quality food and great service."}
{"text":"I should really write a review for this place since I eat here pretty much weekly for lunch. My coworkers and I have tried all the nearby gyro places and we all agree Mika's is the best. They even let me customize the Mediterranean like crazy (no tomato, no pickle, white pita, spicy tziki, spicy hummus). Our only gripe is we wish they made a chicken shawarma pita also, since we can't find a good one nearby and we know theirs would be the best. Very clean, nice digital menu boards and iPad registers, soothing new age music, and some of the best greek food in Tempe (especially for the price). Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I've had better. Their chicken isn't the best but alright. I ordered their small platter. It's your typical Greek restaurant but to be honest I've had better Mediterranean food..."}
{"text":"THA BOMB!!! Food was awesome, place was nice and clean, and to top it off the cashier/waiter was hot!"}
{"text":"A perfect delight for a lunch spot. Just enough space to bring the whole crew. Atmosphere is excellent, staff is super friendly.. and wait for it.. wait for it... the FOOD was Great!   Had the gyro Caesar style with fries and hummus on the side.  The small staff here gives you a very family friendly vibe. Someone even asked throughout my meal if I was enjoying everything. Make me happy to see entrepreneurs doing a great job."}
{"text":"This is pretty decent fast-casual Greek food. It's clean and modern/simple looking inside, and the prices are fair. The only staff member I talked to seemed nice enough. It may not be one of my top Greek places in the valley, but I really have no complaints regarding my visit either."}
{"text":"I'm not an expert on greek food but I love this place. Good, quickservice and the gyros are just how i llike em."}
{"text":"What a joke these reviews with 5 stars are or family friends or members.  Decor nothing special except for I pads tje cashiers where using. Atmosphere well there was a cook using a blender which made it a unique back ground. Dolmas no flavor, greek fries are a joke, gyro was dry and old not even long  slices tazaki was tasteless greek salad was okay fries where soggy we where the only table in the restaurant. Our bill was over $35 for lunch there are way better greek restaurants and way more affordable in the area. For all of u that gave those 5 stars go try some other greek spots in the area then u will understand what I'm saying."}
{"text":"Went here for my first time and can't wait to come back. The food was great, and even better was the service. I was even given a free dessert for my first time! I highly recommend trying them out."}
{"text":"Mikas Greek definetly is one  of my favorite restaurants from now on , great service , excellent food, reasonable prices,  I strongly recomend this place everything is fresh very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I've walked past this many times during my treks from McFate Brewing to Papago Brewing.  It's always looked neat and clean so I decided to give them a try this week for lunch.  They have the usual assortment of Greek/Mediterranean menu items.  I went with a gyro with half gyro meat and half chicken with a side greek salad.  I also had an iced tea and I have to say that their iced tea is particularly good.  The food itself was excellent, plenty of meat and good tzatziki sauce.  They even take the pits out of the olives on the salad!  This place is neat as a pin, the food is good and the service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Made fresh. Good portions. Clean eating area. Favorite lunch spot Mom and I like to go."}
{"text":"Love the Diablo pita. Great portions. I recommend the Greek salad or rice as a side. This will become a regular stop for me."}
{"text":"An out of town friend and I stopped here today on our way to the Desert Botanical Gardens.  Clean Friendly Staff Quick Service Really Yummy Food!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Came to ups store next door and saw a sign with a chicken and hummus plate big with 4.95 on it went in ordered got charged 8 dollars then I asked why he said chicken is 3 dollars more. I get it's business but I hate bs advertising to get you in the store. Then charge me more for it."}
{"text":"Great fast Greek place. Food has always been great. Interior is fairly modern and very clean ad organized."}
{"text":"Just a snack for lunch...  I ordered the falafel dip with tzatziki. Service was very friendly and prompt. It was pre-lunch hour so it was empty. I ordered for take-out. It was quick.  Upon opening my order, the falafel were shaped like mini hockey pucks and were hard and much to salty, leading me to deduce that they were certainly of the frozen mass produced and bagged variety. The tzatziki tasted home made at least and was ok.  Cute place but not a great first experience."}
{"text":"I was in the area looking to kill sometime and grab a quick bite. When i stopped in and the place looked cute! Clean, nice staff, and the Menu looked pretty good.  i ordered the veggie souvlaki, and For $8 i would have expected more veggies than taziki sauce. It was basically dipping pita bread in taziki sauce and have maybe a small handful of chopped up veggies. I wont be coming back for the meal i had."}
{"text":"My wife, daughter and I were looking for some Greek type food, leaning toward healthy and tasty.  We saw the yelp reviews but were very disappointed.  I had the falafel pita with Greek salad.  The salad was ok, but the falafel were discs which seemed dry, overcooked and did not have much depth or flavor.  I am assuming these were frozen type not homemade.  My daughter ordered some chicken and she just got a plate of chicken pieces, no nothing with it, no greens, bread, zero with it.  My wife had a sampler plate of humus, grape leaves and pita. The grape leaves were very good but the rest was just ok.  The most annoying thing was that \"fresh brewed icea tea\" was on the menu.  Exactly what is desired on a hot day, but they do not have plain brewed ice tea for sale, only bottled teas.  The waitress taking our order was difficult to deal with."}
{"text":"just your average gyro spot, does not really do much to separate then from the other gyro spots code by, but its good and fresh, i will be back, and you can score a bogo on citi deals or verizon local deals."}
{"text":"Yum! So Fresh and delicious! The greekumbers were so delicious, I'm addicted! So good! We had two gyros with a Greek salad, the were tasty, very flavorful! Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Delicious hummus, I like both the traditional and jalapeño versions and the pita bread is soft and chewy but still holds up to scooping up hummus. The staff is friendly and it's perfect for picking up lunch on the go or to take back to the office."}
{"text":"Beautiful place, very modern and classic. Super sweet staff...Awesome hidden gem in this area:)"}
{"text":"Delicious! Wasn't to fond of the service. Wasn't to busy and still had to wait 15 mins. Food was very good!"}
{"text":"The food was alright and not very unique or memorable, however we called when it was NOT busy and still had our order messed up. The guy repeated the order back to us when we were ordering, but we still got the wrong food. I might try them again, but I was not satisfied enough to bring my business back or recommend them."}
{"text":"Food: Incredible! I got the 2 meat platter with gyro meat and falafel. It came with 2 sides, I chose Greek salad and red lentil soup. It also came with loads of pita bread and onions and tomatoes! So much food and flavor.   Atmosphere: Very clean and the interior decoration is very modern.   Service: Excellent. My gyro meat was shaved off the spinning chunk and everything else was made to order and in a timely manner. The man working was very friendly.   Price: Above par. For the amount you get in one order, it's well worth the price   I think I've found my new, favorite neighborhood Mediterranean place :)"}
{"text":"Man I love this place not only cause the food is good but reasonably priced but not just that their staff is absolutely amazing compared to some of the other places around here these guys are super friendly super polite and it's always the same guys and you kind of develop some kind of feelings for this place"}
{"text":"Within the past few months a slew of new lunch places have opened up by my work, one of them being Mika's Greek, so I was pretty excited to try them out.  When you 1st walk in, you think wow, what a cool looking place, its clean and modern, and has nice flat screen tv's on the wall, and when you pay you will notice their really isn't a cash register, it's like an ipad sort of thing, but I have to say its pretty cool.   Also the kitchen is opened, as you order can see them cooking the food, I like that.   I ordered the lunch special, I went with a chicken souvlaki pita which had sliced onions, tomatoes and tzatziki sauce and it came with a side order, and I chose fries.  The pita was nice and fresh, the chicken was tender and delish, great flavor, only down side to it was for me, there wasn't enough tzatziki sauce, but that's only because I really love that stuff! Haha   It was a great lunch time meal, look forward to coming back and trying out the rest f the menu."}
{"text":"Simply wonderful & delicious. Our first experience was great. The staff is friendly, the building is clean & modern and the food was delicious. We ordered the chicken platter and gyro platter- each come with two sides of your choice so we got 2 salads, rice and gyro fries for our sides! Yum!   If you're a big soda drinker, they have the Coca-Cola Freestyle drink machine with 100+ different sodas and flavor combos. I rarely order a drink and I had to get one just to try it. Vanilla Rootbeer and Vanilla Gingerale- yes please!   We just moved to this side of town and I can't wait to go back again :)"}
{"text":"Good Greek restaurant for a strip mall.  Very clean and the food was very tasty. I had a gyro with a side of fries.  The fries were hot and crispy and gyro was stuffed with meat.  The meat was tender and flavorful.  The cost of $7.95 was good.  I will definitely come back and try something else"}
{"text":"Liked the decor, but was ordering to go.  Very friendly, helpful staff.  Gyro was good.  Decent amount of meat and not too dry.  I like my gyro with more sauce and this sauce was pretty tasteless.  We didn't like the chicken gyro half as much as the regular...not enough flavor to the chicken and bland sauce."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by since my roommates brought some home the other night. Their gyros are huge and amazingly delicious. I also decided to try the Greek fries and was glad I got extra tzaziki sauce for those. That made them perfect. Last thing I ordered was the dolmades which were awesome as well. I use to go to George's Gyro's all the time but I think this might just be my new favorite. A definite plus that they're close by :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. I had the gyro which comes with their greek fries and it was amazing. Everything was so fresh. I definitely intend to be a regular and check out the rest of their menu. Stay tuned."}
{"text":"I had grilled chicken on a skewer and the yellow basmati rice and lentil soup! I was wonderful and left overs at lunch the next day were just as delicious! Sampled some gyro meat, excellent!!!   I'm hesitant to eat lamb, it was actually very tasty and seasoned well, not gamey like I anticipated! I'll absolutely return!"}
{"text":"This is a medium size greek restaurant on the side of Papago Plaza - I wish it was at a more visible location. This year they renovated their place and improved their menu.  I come here twice or thrice a week for lunch as it closest and best place to eat near my workplace.  Even though I prefer eating at home, it is not always feasible, so Mika comes to my rescue.  I do feel that their food has too much of sodium, atleast more than what should be there is a healthy food. I know that high sodium content in food is a problem all across US, but it doesn't hurt expecting from a place you eat out a lot."}
{"text":"Love this place! Tucked away and hidden in Papago Plaza by a barber shop. It is worth finding this gem. Love the Greek food. Not greasy at all and tastes delicious!! Very health conscious here and the restaurant is clean and cute."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp and I am so happy I did! I live right down the street and order takeout from Mika's pretty regularly.  I can't say enough about the food. it always tastes fresh and healthy! I love to get the Greekpeno Pita with jalapeno hummus and chicken. The falafel here is also amazing. Everyone I have taken here has enjoyed the food. Best part is that it's huge portions for a small price!"}
{"text":"Got the mediterranean pita with chicken to go. It was delicious, and had a nice kick to it. Their tzatziki sauce is bangin'. My order only took a few minutes to make (granted it was 4 PM so I was the only one there). Service was fast & friendly. I'm surprised this place isn't busier nor has more reviews--it's really good and the rest of the menu looks great. I'll definitely be going back to try more."}
{"text":"They give you a lot of food! Vegetables are always really fresh and they don't put lettuce on their gyros  !!"}
{"text":"So I traveled out of town and was craving for Greek food. I was in luck that there was a Greek restaurant near me. I checked the place out and it's a very clean and quiet establishment. I ordered their large platter just to fill my hunger from the order. I had the chicken souvlaki and gyro meat with a side of rice and salad. It also came with pita bread and veggies. Very delicious and filled me up! I also bought their jalapeño hummus which was very good. They have a coke dispensing machine that dispenses a variety of drinks from your usual sugary beverages to low calorie. I liked the place so much that I came back again after my run. I definitely recommend it. People are also friendly so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Very good portion size and very friendly customer service ! Food is very good also . Would defiantly recommend this place to friends !"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a quick authentic Mediterranean style meal. The food tasted great, the staff was friendly, and most importantly the place was very clean. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Loved everything!! Had a Greek salad with gyro and about licked the plate. Best Gyros, best tzaziki and super clean. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Had the greek chicken sandwich, fries and salad... I wish the fries where freshly cooked instead of out of a warmer... I'd go back in the future - not a bad lunch... Decent price sandwich was good salad just they way i like it."}
{"text":"Great food! Really fresh and tasty and a great deal for the money! Pita was loaded with meat. Yogurt sauce was amazing! Restaurant is clean and modern and even the bathrooms were spotless. I'd highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"Very clean and inviting restaurant.  Had the Greek fries and Mediterranean gyro with gyro meat.  Food was hot and very tasty.  Good portions, couldn't even finish it all!   I love gyros and will definitely come back here to try other menu items.  The price was very good for the quality and the portion size."}
{"text":"Every time I walk into this place I know I'm going to have a great meal. This guy who runs the place (I'm assuming since he's always there) is extremely helpful and friendly. The food is always cooked to perfection and they bring your food out to you. They even check on you to make sure that everything is good. By far one of my favorite places to go. My kids love this place as well! My son's salad that you can see in the picture (he's one of the rare children in the world who loves salad and prefers it over anything) is always crisp and fresh. If you haven't tried this spot you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Gyro plate was excellent.  Hummus plate was great. Wow do these pitas beat the crap out of pita jungle. Warm, fluffy, sweet even.  Very happy this resturant came to town."}
{"text":"Staying at a hotel around the corner, found Mika's on Yelp, saw positive rating, checked their website, liked the menu, stopped in, and boooooyeahhhhh!  I had the Greekpeño and fries.  Everything put together quickly from scratch, gyro meat was great, pickles and hummus and romaine all worked together perfectly, the pita didn't fall apart, it didn't leak all over the place (not that this is bad in a Greek/Middle Eastern sandwich, but maybe not if you're driving or on a date or something), and it was all delicious!  The fries too!  Will I go back for dinner 6 hours after lunch?!@?@!  Definitely maybe?  Will I take someone there the next time I'm in Phoenix?  For real!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch because we had a buy one get one free entree coupon. The food was good nothing special, I've had better Gyros before but with the coupon it was only 8 bucks for two of us to eat so it was a great deal. Maybe if I'm in the area again I'd come back"}
{"text":"Great gyros good prices good service clean restaurant just there wasn't that many customers in there and I wondered why but great food"}
{"text":"some of the best hummus i've had in a long time! the remodel (from the previous gyro restaurant) is gorgeous. no more of the ubiquitous blue & white \"greek\" theme. i also had a greek salad with chicken & it was delicious as well. i will go back for more."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Awesome staff. Food was fresh and delicious and fast. I am right up the street from this place and I am happy that I can walk here and get good foods. Mediterranean pita and Greek fries! Do it!"}
{"text":"My boss got us to go food from Mika's, which we have named \"Fake George's\", only because they used to be named George's, but George's Famous is less than a block away, so they had to change. The interior was clean, with a few tables.   The menu had your normal Greek stuff, but was confusing to me. I wanted a falafel pita, but only saw falafel as a platter, but the lady said it was also a pita. The menu didn't reflect that, so I wonder what else I'm missing out on.  The falafel was different, but I liked it. Maybe nuts in it? Couldn't put my finger on it. It was cooked well, and was not over-sauced. The side salad I got to go with it was fresh, and I liked the dressing. My boss got the Gyro platter or salad with gyro meat...something like that. She loves it.  The food came out really quickly, and the counter service was friendly."}
{"text":"I've been here a hundred times, I'm surprised I haven't rated it yet!! The chicken is freshly grilled, the hummus is made with different, awesome seasonings. The baklava is really good and addictive, I could eat like 10 of those. And as a finale, other than the dolmades (my parents LOVED these) and their zesty salads, buy the Greek fries. Garlic will be running through your veins for a week."}
{"text":"Try the Mika's Fries. They were far better than what I expected. The restaurant was really nice and the staff was very friendly. My new spot."}
{"text":"I used to work near Mikas. Sad we moved this place was nice clean and great food. I drive from mesa to eat here. They have some of the best Gyros around. They will also package the meat sauce and fixings separate so you can assemble at home."}
{"text":"It's  if, McDonald's and Greek food had a baby. My rice was over done, the veggie wrap was mediocre."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem!!!  Not only is the food amazing, but it's a great value, service is awesome and The dinning room lobby is top notch and squeaky clean!!!  I had the Picado with rice today and it was as great as any pita or gyro I have ever eaten. Just spicy enough with peppers and onions and excellent meat. It was assembled well  on a real plate and consumed with expertise! The yellow rice was fluffy, hot, and well seasoned, It's also addictive! I wants some more!!!!  Its a small locally owned chain, and I am lucky enough to have one so close to home.  Myka's past the ultimate test for me, it's CRAVABLE!!!!"}
{"text":"Update for my previous review: they've ditched those Gold Peak tea dispensers and added 3 options of fresh brewed Passport Teas. Love it."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. Very, very welcoming and the food was amazing. I am grieving the loss of a loved one and I had a breakdown while ordering, and the man working (who I think was the owner) was so understanding and nice to me, didn't make me feel stupid. He paid for my meal & the food was amazing. I would recommend this place to everyone based on the customer service alone. Thank you for being a small bright spot in my bad day."}
{"text":"Great Service - super nice guy at the counter. Gyro Meat - AMAZING! Lots of meet in the Pita Location - Good Atmophere- SO So  I would hit this place up for take out!"}
{"text":"Love these guys. I've been there a few times and the food is great, the staff is amazing, and it's a good portion of food!   They even remembered my family and asked about them the next time I came in.  You guys go above and beyond in your service, we appreciate it!"}
{"text":"Best place in the valley for a gyro or Greek salad. The gyro picado is my favorite. Always made perfectly, fresh and juicy. The restaurant is clean and the staff is always friendly. They have other locations which are equally great."}
{"text":"Walked in looking for something more delish than a regular cold sandwich.  This place is right next to Jimmy Johns - so I read a few reviews and thought I'd give it a try.  First off the place is spotless clean.  Large contemporary photographs grace the walls adding a modern air.  Customer service was polite and fast.  I ordered a couple Greek chicken pitas to go plus some hummus.  The chicken pita was delicious - totally loaded with flavorful meat and piping hot.  Highly recommend. :)"}
{"text":"I ordered through Uber eats- which may have limited the menu or misrepresented it. But I ordered beef suvlaki. Souvlaki is supposed to be small pieces/cubes of meat. The \"beef\" souvlaki was ground beef pressed to look like steak- . Having lived in Greece and having grown up around \"off the boat\" Greeks- this place was a massive disappointment. The French fries were the run of the mill French fries (could've gone to a diner to get the same quality). The \"beef\" souvlaki was ground beef not cubes of beef- it was dry and I honestly couldn't eat it.   For the price I felt it was lacking significantly. The tzatziki sauce was OK - not good/not bad.  Disclaimer I'm from NY- new to AZ. Maybe it's the the area difference, maybe it is the Uber eats app misrepresenting the food? I don't like to leave reviews like this, but... it really was disappointing. I would've appreciated reading an honest review prior to ordering."}
{"text":"First time here. Went for a falafel platter. Got 3 brown disc looking things. Tried to take a bite of one and about chipped my tooth. Falafel should NOT be crunchy! Ever. Overly done and bad taste. Not sure what extra stuff they put in their falafel discs but good falafel does not need any \"extra\" stuff. Taziki sauce is ok. Rice is good but I didn't come in for rice......."}
{"text":"So amazing! Probably the closest thing to an authentic Greek gyro i have had since I moved back from Greece a year ago. Kalo!!"}
{"text":"Great flavors, amazing selection!  Food: Mika's has a really good selection of \"fast food Greek\" fare. This was my first visit, and I honestly had a hard time choosing! I like that you can build your pita by selecting the toppings, the meat you want (or veggie), and the side. Did I mention they have a good selection? I was in the mood for something spicy, so I went with the DIABLO, which is tangy tzatziki, cucumber, tomatoes, and sriracha feta. For the meat I went traditional gyro meat, and for the side I went with the lemon garlic lentil soup. I was very pleased with my section! Everything was fresh and tasty, and the DIABLO was indeed spicy! I would get the same thing again, but there are so many choices...  :-)   Cost: $7.95 plus tax for my gyro and soup was very reasonable!  Service:  The staff was friendly, and my food was served quickly.  Atmosphere: Pretty good for a strip-mall style fast food restaurant. The seating is comfortable, lighting is good, and there are interesting photos on the walls. It's kept very clean, too!  Overall: Pleasant atmosphere, tasty food, and very nice selection. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! This is the third greek place we have tried and for me it was the best. I love falafel..and whatever makes it green inside!"}
{"text":"I love Mika's!  The food is always fresh and full of flavor.  My favorite thing about Mika's?  It is always IMMACULATE.  Not just the dining area...the kitchen too!   The glistening stainless steel is visible as soon as you walk through the door.  I am always confident that my food was prepared with food safety in mind, which is very important to me.   Tonight I am enjoying the hummus plate with tasty jalapeno hummus and delicious grilled chicken.  And a soft, warm pita of course!  Eating healthy never tasted so good! :)"}
{"text":"I had gyro which was excellent. Not greasy and the best fresh Greek bread. I also loved the green tea I might have to start going there instead of QT for daily iced tea. Also love that you can get a salad as one of the sides."}
{"text":"Go there right now and get yourself Mika's fries. It's an unbelievable concoction of fries, with some sort of incredible Greek balsamic dressing, loaded with juicy delicious gyro meat, the world's best tzatziki sauce and feta cheese. I almost ate to the point of throwing up because it was so good."}
{"text":"I LOVE MIKA'S GREEK!! This place is located just a hop, skip, and jump away from where I work. This is by far the best place to get a gyro or a pita. My apologies to those other places who sell the same thing, there's a new sheriff in town and they blow you guys out of the water. The customer service is great. There is always a smile of their face, which makes a world of difference. They're really quick, so this works out great when you're pressed for time. I like to just call and order my food, very rarely does this take longer than 15 min. The Chicken Souvlaki Pita is AMAZING!! The chicken is never dry, it's always really tender and moist. I'm super happy they opened up. This place is great for lunch and dinner. You must come here and try it for yourselves!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Staff is super friendly. Place is clean and really nice. Had the Greek sampler and a side of lamb. It was yummy."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal..  Went for lunch on a Saturday before Labor Day.  The place was pretty quiet.  Nice decor, very friendly staff, and the food was excellent.  Chicken served with Greek salad was fresh, juicy and perfectly grilled.  Greekumbers sounded goofy, but they tasted great - cucumbers, tzaziki and feta.  Surprisingly good...  Looking forward to the next visit!"}
{"text":"Smells FANTASTIC! Taste as good as it smells too. Staff is so polite and helpful too.  Good size portions.  Soup is delicious and I recall saying I could eat just the soup and be satisfied. I like the soda machine with its numerous options.  Sometimes, a lot lately, I want the effervescence of a soda but without the artificial colors, flavors, and toxic sweeteners/calories = soda water.  They have that here.   Booths are spacious.  Decor is clean and simple, maybe what could be classified as minimalist.  Colors are mellow.  I like the menu boards.  The font is easy to read and the colors on the gray black background help keep it legible. And of course, the menu options are yummy. I've tried a couple of things like pita with gyro meat or beef slouvaki.  The hummus is good and the Baklava is tasty too, but I can tell that it's mass produced.  Here's me, soup and the sparkling water and I'm good to go."}
{"text":"What I love about this place is the cleanliness, extensive yet simple menu, friendly staff, speediness, and the great location!   I've been here quite a few times now for lunch and each time I have yet to be disappointed. The menu may look a little overwhelming at first but the staff are great at explaining the items and what you can do to custom items or substitute on your plates.   Every time I go I always have the original gyro plate which comes with fries but I substitute for their yellow Greek rice. White tzaziki sauce, onions and tomatoes come on it, however I leave the tomatoes out. I will have to try all the other delicious looking items on their menu next time.   My friends ordered the chicken gyro with fries. I taste a little of the chicken and it was amazing! For those that like gluten free, there's quite a few items on the menu to choose from!  Great place! Fast and friendly service!!!"}
{"text":"All of the dishes have so much flavor! Service is quick and the place is spotless. Try the Mikas Fries if you are feeling adventurous. I love the modern feel of Mikas and if you like Siracha, you will be in heaven."}
{"text":"Mika's greek has the bestt food in the valley with 4 locations to serve you today i came to the one in downtown phx and we ordered the mikas platter with mikas fries uggg they were soo good me and my husband have been eating here for 3 yrs and the food is always fresh and delicious the staff is amazing and the owner don is the bestt and nicest guy so if your looking for a quick stop for some delicious food come to mikas greek - G and Jehona"}
{"text":"Great new little Greek food place. I had the \"Pica\" gyro which was nice and spicy with jalapeños.   Service was fast and the quality was excellent. Place is clean and new and upscale. Great find!"}
{"text":"Soooooooooooooooo fire . I've been looking for a gyro spot near downtown and I've found it. The jalapeño hummus is so good too. I really like how they have the gyro on the spit and they shave your gyro off and cook it to your liking. So flame I'll be back FOR SURE"}
{"text":"Eat here all the time. Great food and great management/owners. Not sure who's working tonight but when I ordered rice her excuse was \"we're closing no more rice\" it's 8:40. You don't close for 20 minutes. I drove 20 min to get late night carbs.   Great place but being 20 minutes from closing isn't an excuse for the most important part of my meal."}
{"text":"I had Mika's large platter with gyro, salad and rice! I didn't care for the rice, but the gyro meat was good, and they were definitely not cheap about the meat AND I LOVED THE SALAD.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We were visiting Scottsdale for A few days we found this Greek restaurant. It is awesome excellent food great value would come back again and again and again"}
{"text":"This place rocks. Fresh, yummy and perfect flavors. The chicken pita  is delicious with just the right amount of tzatziki. The fries are fried to perfection. I just got the lentil soup and it is a burst of flavor. Very surprising. The restaurant is clean and inviting. Prices are very affordable. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"When you check in to an establishment and reach Duchess status you probably owe them a review. Honestly, I owed Mika's a review a long time ago. As a lover of Greek food and falafels this is my go-to lunch place. It also is incredibly clean and uses super fresh ingredients. I'll eat Greek food from almost anywhere, but lots of places can have very greasy dishes. Not here. Lots of grilling, minimal oil usage (even in fried items like the falafel) and the presentation is on point. You pay for quality here but they certainly deliver it."}
{"text":"Yum! I've been on a Greek food kick and when I needed some falafel for lunch last week this hit the spot. Try the rice!   The place is new, clean, and they have a large menu. I just remember being shocked by the price - it's sort of fast food, the prices just seemed high.  Bonus - they keep LOTS of Sriracha bottles around!"}
{"text":"I loved this little Greek place! Definitely off the beaten path, but clean, modern and the food was delicious. I had the gyro platter with fries and shared a baklava for dessert. The gyro was a bit different than I expected- pita triangles served alongside the meat and toppings instead of a pre-made gyro - but so delicious that I ate more than I should have. Baklava is not my favorite, but this version was great. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am a regular. I'm obsessed with the greek salad with chicken. The food is always fresh and made right in front of you. I always feel good after having a meal at Mika's Greek."}
{"text":"Its either the grilled chicken or gyro Diablo that I go with and the lentil soup! You cant beat the price and the quality. Friendly staff, quick service, and most of all amazing food! You cant go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Place is clean, and open air concept.  Staff was friendly.  My only issue really here was the price and size of the dishes.  I don't have a problem with dishing out 13 dollars a plate if the size is substantial or the food is amazing, neither was the case here.  For two people, with out drinks, two \"large size\" entrees, a appetizer, and tip, 50 bucks. Still left a little hungry, .  Sorry, won't be returning."}
{"text":"Mika's Greek 780 W. Elliot Road Tempe 85284  A group of us descended on Mika's for dinner. The restaurant is small, sparsely decorated, but immaculately clean. Orders are taken at a main counter, then is brought to your table for you.  Our group ordered an assortment of items so that we could all try them.   First was falafel. Nicely cooked and properly seasoned, one could tell they were fresh because they were green instead of brown inside.   The Mika's fries were a real treat and reminded me of nacho's in that they were topped with gyro meat, feta cheese, a house dressing and tzatiziki sauce. This was a mouth full of flavor. Chicken souvlaki was tender and moist and the dolma's were perfection.   The grilled Greek chicken served on a platter was marinated in olive oil and garlic and was cooked just right. I got mine with rice and salad as well as fresh warm pitas.   A member of our party was a vegetarian, and was not disappointed in all the selection on the menu.   The restaurant only serves soft drinks, but that was not a drawback. Desserts were on the menu, but no one had any room left to try them.  Prices range from $7.95 to $12.95 and portions were of a good size for most anyone. Service was nice and friendly, and the cleanliness was a true standout.  I give the restaurant 4 stars"}
{"text":"Rough morning? Rough week? Rough MONTH? (We won't go there) Forgot your lunch?   Mika's Greek to the rescue! Been meaning to pop over here for a while now.  In search of something protein loaded / semi-healthy to fuel a workout, I got out of my office (and perhaps get out of my funk) and drove over to Mika's.   First of all, it's extremely clean and modern inside. No frills decor, screens overhead detailing the menu and iPad registers.   Very nice gal who took my order. I got the Chicken Souvlaki Pita combo with a salad. $7.95. No drink, but there's a Coke Freestyle machine here.   Food came out in about 15 minutes, piping hot.   Pst, secret's out: If you get there at or around 11, you'll get your food quickly before the lunch crowd arrives.   Generous portion of juicy, well marinated chicken with tomatoes, red onion and tzatziki sauce enveloped in what seemed to be a grilled pita.   While it was delicious and filling, the tzatziki sauce was lacking depth in flavor. Where was the lemon, garlic and dill? All I was tasting was yogurt and salt and pepper. :(   The salad had all the characteristics of a typical Greek salad: Cucumber, tomatoes, onions, kalamata olives, sprinkle of feta cheese and a pepperoncini.  What I loved about it? The dressing!   It was oil based, not creamy ranch like stuff like that one Greek place. Next time I'll get it on the side though, as whoever prepped the salad went cookoo bananas with the dressing.   3.5 Stars: Nothing mind blowing here like my friends made it out to be.  Hoping this was just an off day with the Tzatziki because everything else was delicious.   I will definitely return to Mika's Greek to try their Original Gyro, with Andrew C. -  And perhaps up this rating!"}
{"text":"It's GREAT Gyros, best around the restaurant is immaculate, etc.  Dito for all the reviews but someone needs to mention that they definitely \"don't put enough of their tziki sauce on their gyros.  That is consistent we go there all the time and mention to them they always make you purchase another..."}
{"text":"Great food! Awesome service! But above all, one of the cleanest restaurants I've ever been to. I would recommend this restaurant in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Mika's serves up quick, fresh, flavorful Greek food that you can take to go or eat in.  All food is made fresh to order.  The wait time for your food is normally 2-5 minutes depending on what you get, but when in rush, you can call an order in ahead of time.  They make everything from salads to gyros to full meals.  The prices are reasonable.  Its a great place for lunch or a simple dinner.  The restaurant is well maintained, modern, and very comfortable, but not easily spotted from N. Scottsdale Road.  They also offer free Wi-Fi.  This is my \"go-to\" place for something quick, tasty, and fairly healthy.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Greek salad with gyro was fresh and tasty.  Got it to-go.  Was prepared quickly.  Restaurant was clean and staff are friendly."}
{"text":"I love the gyro pita at Mika's. I have always been tempted to order pizza but I always come back to the gyro. My wife typically gets the greek salad with chicken and she is never dissapointed."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for lunch/early dinner. I get the $7.50 combo with lamb gyro and salad. The lamb is so tender it melts in your mouth. Wonderful!! The people are great who work here."}
{"text":"First time here - was great! Hummus was awesome, food was great. Excellent service too - will be back."}
{"text":"Great and very fresh fast food. I had a grilled chicken plate. The chicken is very tender and moist. Had a yummy Greek side salad with plenty of feta olives and chopped cucumber. Just visiting town or I'd become a regular"}
{"text":"One of the better hummuses I've had in AZ and the gyros are delicious. The prices are reasonable as well."}
{"text":"I stepped inside to get a to-go order and was impressed by the contemporary chic feel of this place, just like the decor at the other location on Elliot. The menu has all your Mediterranean style favorites, with a twist of Southwestern elements such as their jalapeno hummus. I got the Greekpeno pita to go with a Caesar salad.   My order was ready in a speedy amount of time and nicely packaged. When I opened up the package, my pita was filled with 3 tasty looking falafel, greens, pickles, tomatoes and jalapeno hummus. It was a pretty enjoyable lunch. The bread was fluffy and soft, and all the elements worked well together. The falafel was crisp and well seasoned. I also liked the slight hint of spiciness from the jalapeno hummus. While I still have a favorite hummus and falafel at another restaurant their rendition here was overall good.  Service was great. The cashier was very kind and friendly. I also got a few recommendations on what to get at DaYung's next time I go there haha (Try the tomato smoothie he says).  Overall, you can't go wrong with great service and delicious pita sandwiches!  4.25/5"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best gyro I've had in Arizona! Mika's serves up reasonably priced meals with high quality, very fresh ingredients. We came here with a Groupon and were pleasantly surprised by the quality, portions, and atmosphere of this cute little Greek eatery.  Our Groupon included 2 pitas and 2 fountain drinks. We decided on the Mediterranean chicken and a gyro picado. Each pita comes with a side (Fries, soup, salad, or rice). We chose rice and soup as ours.  The gyro meat was tender, with well balanced flavors in the pita itself. There was a lot of meat and veggies inside, which made the pita a great deal since it also included a side. I loved that they had a unique twist on the classic gyro pita, adding jalapeno to the mix to add some spicy kick. The lentil soup I had was quite good. It had the right amount of spice, and was filling and hearty. The Mediterranean chicken pita was also very good, with tender, juicy chunks of chicken. The pitas themselves were soft, slightly grilled, and came with the option of regular or wheat. I tried both types, and they were both equally good. As for the side of rice, it was well seasoned, with a nice fluffy texture.  Fountain drinks are free-range, and there's also a tea station with several options of tea available. Sodas are Coca-Cola brand products.   The atmosphere had a nice modern feel, very unlike other Greek places I've been to where they have a slightly outdated look, accentuated by those cheesy \"GYROS\" posters that look like they're from the '70s and '80s, of a young lady brandishing a gyro.  This restaurant is definite gem of a find through Groupon. Go here if you want delicious Greek food!"}
{"text":"What a great lunch! I got the gyro with rice and it was really good. It tasted fresh and the rice was full of flavor, and the service was amazing! The gentleman who took my order was very sweet, brought me my food and even got my utensils when I forgot to get them myself.  I wasn't sure how packed it was going to be because I went on my lunch break (at 1pm) but it wasn't packed at all and my experience was great!"}
{"text":"I was impressed. Their falafel and gyro were amazing. Their Dolmeh was a bit cold and their Greek fries had too much feta. I hope they also fix their ice machine.   For some reason this place reminds me of chipotle... Which is a good thing. Overall I was full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Went here after a couple of months. The place is now almost 2-3 times bigger. Very clean. The waiters are very nice and orders come up really fast. Ordered the falafel pita sandwich and it was really good. Would definitely recommend this for a quick greek lunch :)"}
{"text":"Got a greek salad with gyro meat. Meat was moist and the portion was big.  Can't wait to check out more of the menu"}
{"text":"So much cleaner than all those grimy mom & pop Greek spots. Mika's is clean and modern. Lots of choices of meat, 2 kinds of chicken and beef, along with Lamb (gyro meat). It makes me happy that they have the coke machine with the hundred choice. I get the Greek salad with gyro meat. It's big with feta and red wine vinegar based dressing. It comes with a grilled pita on the side."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Daniel is awesome and always remembers my preferences. Atmosphere is clean  and well done."}
{"text":"Unbelievable Gyro. First time here but plan on coming back many more times. Wasn't happy that my buddy was charged $.75 for more sauce for his Gyro. Staff very nice."}
{"text":"Amazing food, lovely modern atmosphere, and great service. Love the classic gyro. Also have Great desserts, recommend highly."}
{"text":"Ordered for take out again and have to up the rating. The gyro meat was so incredibly flavored and tender I can't wait to try it again.   The hummos was creamy and the falafel had just the right amount of spice. I ordered the gyro Mediterranean style and the pickle and tahini rocked. This is now in our regular rotation for take out."}
{"text":"I have not been the biggest fan of Greek food restaurants in tempe or phoenix . generally the food tastes dry and old like its been sitting out all day or they don't give you enough meat however this place was very refreshing not only did they load up the meat the rice was fresh and everything tastes like it was just made very moist and delicious will definitely be going here again soon"}
{"text":"Met a gf here for lunch. What a delight. The place smelled like fresh cut cucumber. You order in line and then sit. They bring the food out to you. I ordered a hummus duo and Greek salad. The hummus was delicious. The salad was fresh and perfectly zesty!  The restaurant quickly filled up and I realized that many people already know about this gem in south Scottsdale. I'll be back."}
{"text":"The Greek salad was excellent here! The tahini and feta was awesome and I've been to Greece and this food was very good. The owner was very nice and described how the food was made and what was in the ingredients. We sat outside on a lovely patio area. A nice lunch spot in Tempe!"}
{"text":"I ordered to go. There was spit ontop of my soup. I had to go back and get a new one. Who is spitting in peoples food and why? They need a health inspector in there stat.  I will report this. They werent even apologetic."}
{"text":"Love the redesign inside! Food was great. Me & my sister split the Greek salad, Mika fries & baklava sundae. Food came out quickly and was delish!! I'll be back..."}
{"text":"Very good food, large portions, and good selection. I came with a family of five, and everyone loved it. Most people ordered their food to go, but we dined in. The restaurant was clean and nicely updated. The woman behind the counter was polite, served our food, and cleared our places, which was a nice surprise."}
{"text":"Pros: the place is spotless and the service was GREAT. Prices are reasonable and the foods made fresh to order.  Cons: The food was absolutely flavorless. I rarely need to add salt to my food but it was needed on every item. Chicken was bland and the rice was terrible. The best part of the meal was the pita.  Nice place with a great staff but the food was average at best.  I wouldn't return on my own but if someone insisted on going I'd be ok with it."}
{"text":"LOVE living so close to this quick lunch/dinner spot!  The greekpeno with falafel is my go to every time! Fast friendly service and the place always looks nice and tidy.  Also, their pita is delicious!"}
{"text":"Not the best Greek I've ever had but sufficient for a quick lunch. I like the open kitchen concept. Service is pretty fast and the portions are slightly larger than average.Every time I eat here the restaurant is extremely clean. My only real complaint  is that the pita sandwiches are often oozing with oil by the time you reach the last bite. Also, they do not offer lunch combos and a gyro, fries and soda will cost you almost $11...The new Coke Freestyle machine almost makes it worth it. I usually eat here once a week during the lunch hour."}
{"text":"Pulled up to this restaurant by chance. I read the exceptional reviews and thought this sounds good!!!  Delicious food, amazing interior, friendly staff. I took pictures of the restaurant itself.  VERY NICE.  They do not offer wiFi but they have plenty of charging stations if you want to use your computer or tablet.   I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! This is the second location I have visited and both had great  food and service.   Reasonable prices and large portions.  This is definitely my go to place for gyros."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch or dinner.  Gyro was done right and Greek fries were good. Nice prices and plenty of options to customize it the way you want. Friendly staff makes for a welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great Greek food. The gyro platter was delicious, meat was tender and well seasoned, great salad and the lentil soup was tasty.  Definitely a new central phx favorite. Must try"}
{"text":"Seemingly endless customization options set Mika's apart from other Greek lunch locations.  First, choose what you want in your pita. There's the traditional gyro meat, but also beef souvlaki, chicken, falafel, and more. Then, choose from a few styles. I thought the original was only so-so, but the Picado, with jalapenos, onions, and peppers grilled with the gyro meat, was a fantastic change of pace. Pair whatever you get with a salad, as the fries are honestly kinda lame.   Gosh, I'm not gonna rave about this place, but it's edible Greek made fast. Come here when you're on the go."}
{"text":"Three of us went at 5pm Saturday before Valentine's Day.  We wanted a place that wouldn't be inundated with celebrants, one that was a locally owned one and someplace we haven't been before.  Mika's Greek fit the bill perfectly!               First impression:  just like so many Yelp reviews, it was hard to find.  I thought there was a Mediterranean place on the west side of the plaza... nope... there was a pizza place that has a huge ad for GYROS in the front window.  That was misleading.  The man there, helped us when we asked where Mika's was and he kindly pointed.  We will have to stop there for pizza sometime, since he did help us find it.  Mika's is on the south part of Papago Plaza, next to the British Pub.      Second impression:   CLEAN!  It was a crisp clean interior design and modern.  I really liked it.      Next:  We were to order at the front  counter and they would bring it to us.  A little awkward with one of us with a cane, and having never been there... but we were just new to the place.... next time will be easy peasy.        Next:   WOWOWOWOW the food was great!  We ordered the Greek Sampler and my favorite part was the hummus, tzatziki and pita.  Very quickly after that, our entrees arrived.  Each of us had ordered pitas.  The chicken caesar pita was said to have really tender delicious chicken... the Original pita was yummy with extra tzatziki... and the Diablo pita was very much enjoyed by our friend.  The pitas come with a side.   Our choices of rice and salad worked very well with our pitas.      Desert was very very tempting, but with having had the sampler before the meal, we look forward to having the honey walnut baklava another time.   I would highly recommend going."}
{"text":"Fast, Reasonably priced, Delicious! i always go with the Mediterranean pita with gyro meat, and the greek salad, never disappointing!"}
{"text":"It was okay. I kind of had higher expectations for this place place based on  some of the reviews but for me it was just OK. The prices are reasonable the location is good there's ample parking."}
{"text":"Everything we've had here, over several different visits, has been really great - fresh, and very tasty.  I love Greek food, and for a quick/casual restaurant, Mika's hits the spot.  The restaurant is modern, clean, and very pleasant. The staff is always super nice.  Have absolutely no complaints, and am actually headed there again tonight, to grab a quick bite with my husband!"}
{"text":"I have had my share of a Greek food and this is amazing!  Fresh, flavorful and affordable.   If you are in Scottsdale you must check them out.  Indoor and outdoor seating is a plus, and it's not loud inside at all."}
{"text":"Love love love it!!!!  I have never been here and had anything that I haven't liked. They are really fast which makes going here on your lunch break easy. I usually order take out and I get a text 10 min later that my order is ready."}
{"text":"This location has been many different restaurants over the years - this is a tough spot. This is my favorite thing it's been though.   The food is great here and the owner is cool. The prices are really reasonable and the portions are large. The place is really clean and the decor is nice. Everything is cooked in plain sight, so there's no mystery.   My only complaint would be that he doesn't deliver yet. We definitely need a good gyro place that delivers in the area.  Seriously though - the food is really delicious. If you like flavors - it's all really flavorful. Great hummus too. Try the pizza puff."}
{"text":"Great place, good food, friendly and fast service!  However, needs some daily specials like Mika's Monday......or let us use the entertainment book coupon more then once."}
{"text":"Literally searched for \"food\" and this restaurant came up, a good Gyro can be hard to find. Seriously delicious, really quick service, it's hot,  fresh,  great beef & lamb, pita, lots of it. Price is good!"}
{"text":"This place is expensive enough to afford air conditioning. So came in ordered food, ordered a drink but was told the soda machine was out but tea was still an option... Ordered a tea, ice machine is broken, all I get is a sorry, not even an offer for a refund... So now I'm sitting here drinking hot iced tea with no air conditioning waiting on my food. I WILL NOT be back here."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp and have only been here for lunch on week days. They are pretty speedy I can usually get in and out within 30 to 35 mintues. Out of the dozen or so times I have been here the food has always been great.   The best part is no matter what I order I always get the portions, taste and great food. It's awesome. I strongly recommend you try this place out you won't regret it! Their beef is to die for!"}
{"text":"This might be our new spot for grocery shopping nights! Wow! Loved the food! Very modern, sophisticated, and clean restaurant! Very impressed! \"I'll be back!\" - Arnold"}
{"text":"Love this place, great food and even faster service. I've been going here for awhile because I work right across the street at a tech company."}
{"text":"FYI Grub hub increases the price for each item noticeably. I'd suggest not using Grub hub and just calling the restaurant directly if you want to place an order.  Been here three times so far and every time has been a good experience. Good food, good prices, portion sizes are great (the large plate is a ridiculous amount of food for the money), service was fast and polite, there are plenty of ways to order and you can dine in or takeout. Highly recommend for a tasty quick bite that will fill you up without emptying the wallet."}
{"text":"Awesome food, atmosphere and management! I had the Greek Sampler and the hummus (plain and jalapeño), dolmades and falafel were so flavorful and fresh! Yummmmm.....  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Best Greek food I've had thus far! I get it all the time! Love the jalapeño cilantro hummus and the chicken skewers."}
{"text":"I got charged TWICE by them and when I brought this to their attention, I was told that their manager wasnt in to perform a refund (LOL) and that my refund would be done the following monday.  It has been 3 weeks and I have yet to see that $25 they owe me."}
{"text":"Really good Greek food that I really enjoyed. The falafel was well seasoned and so tasty. Fresh vegetables, pita and these amazing Greek fries with feta cheese and Greek dressing that I really dug.   The staff were so friendly and the place is really clean."}
{"text":"Best gyro meat I've ever tasted, plus the owner has an infectious smile!"}
{"text":"The girl taking my order didn't know what a simple \"gyro & fry\" combo meant. Not the brightest crayon in the box....so good luck ordering. After I ordered I heard her complain to another worker & they both glared in my direction. Worst \"customer service\" I've ever experienced. I ended up having them refund my order....it was that bad. Stay away from this place. I'm surprised they're still in business."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed.  The classic pita has great beef/lamb with red onion and tomato.  My young son wanted no onion nor tomato and they easily accommodated.   They have several other choices of pitas.  Including jalapeno and a Sriracha which I want to try on future visits. Numerous other items on the menu.  Side of humas good, side salad excellent.  It Mika'd my day.  Nice gyros!  Wonderful staff!"}
{"text":"Best Gyro I've had in years.  Tatziki (sp?) is PHENOMENAL.  I wish they sold it in jars."}
{"text":"It was pretty late and I was craving a gyro sandwich so I googled Greek and Mika's came up! They are open till 9 which was really cool and the inside of the store is so inviting. The man behind the counter was friendly and quick! I ordered a gyro sandwich and it was delicious, the lamb was sliced thinly and they give you a generous portion~ I had a great experience!"}
{"text":"GIVE ME MOREEEEEE.  Okay this place is glorious. My boyfriend and I bought a groupon to try it out which included a pita of your choice with a drink and a side. Awesome. I also had to get the hummus sampler because I loooove hummus. I was so stoked when our food came out because the portions are nice and big, the fries looked fresh and crispy, hummus and my lentil soup looked delicious. Thankfully I was starving that day, otherwise I would not have been able to finish my meal. It was one of the best pitas I have ever had. Fries, hummus and soup were divine. Service was perfect. The man who is there often is very nice and even nicer to look at, hahaha. I love this place! Try it!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Delicious food and friendly, professional service.  Love love love the garlic lemon lentil soup. And the baklava--yummy!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch on the recommendation of a friend.  The restaurant is very clean.  The food was fresh and enjoyable.  We tried several items.  I would suggest order your favorite Greek food item and you will most likely enjoy it.  We will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"UPDATE: DO NOT ORDER THRU YELP!!!! THEY CHARGE AN ADDITIONAL $3 PER ITEM TO THE ORDER JUST FOR USING THE WEBSITE!!! CALL YOUR ORDER IN!!! RESTAURANT CHARGES $8.95 for the wraps and yelp or Grubhub charges $11.95!!! So bomb! Super fresh and fast! I had a chicken Caesar pita with side Greek salad and the dressing is delicious!! Added a drink and spent $11 out the door. In a plaza so can easily drive past it but it's worth the extra look!! Consider me a regular"}
{"text":"First of all... Mika's Fries were amazing. You HAVE to order them. We ordered them with gyro instead of chicken. My boyfriend and I were able to share 1 plate and were full by the end. The fries are topped with a lemon-y balsamic vinaigrette, a tzatziki sauce, and gyro. Every component of the dish was flavorful- the fries were hot and fresh, the vinaigrette had the perfect amount of lemon, the tzatziki was refreshing, and the gyro was so good. Definitely recommend. I need to go back and try something else on the menu!!"}
{"text":"This place was soon good I thought no place would make a better Gyro the Pita Jungle so glad to see I was wrong. It may be a little tucked away but once you find it you will be glad that you did. The lady at the counter was so nice and informative and on a plus didn't try to shave information at us or try to over sell something."}
{"text":"I am surprised I haven't reviewed this place yet, as many times as I come here! This is a long overdue review!   Hands down, this place is amazing! The ambiance of the restaurant, with its cool Mediterranean music and vibes, pulls you in to sit down and stay awhile! The smell of sizzling gyro meat, filling the air and luring you in for a taste! The crispy hot french fries, pairing so perfectly with their (seemingly) endless ketchup supply, is enough to keep you hooked for good! Okay, so now that I sound like the Mika's addict that I am, let me convince you just how awesome they are!    Their customer service, nothing short of perfect! Consistently sweet, consistently welcoming, consistently great service. These guys are super fast too! I usually call ahead to come pick up my order, and within 5-10 minutes, it's there waiting for me! I've never had to wait longer than 10 minutes for my order.   The food is downright delicious. HUGE portions, served fresh and hot! I tend to shy away from dairy, (as it sadly doesn't agree much with my tummy!), but their Tatziki sauce is something I can actually eat, and brag about! It's a MUST try! It's just so yummy and flavorful! It really brings the classic gyro together, in my opinion!  Another plus, for all you soda lovers out there, a fancy Coke machine that lets you pick and choose different flavors for your plain ol' soda, making it a customizable delight!"}
{"text":"This place has lost me as a customer. I was eating here for lunch about once a week until they recently changed the menu.  Replacing gyros with wraps is a bad move.  If I want a wrap, I'll go to a sandwich place.  If I want a gyro, I'll go to a Greek restaurant.  But since the gyros are off the menu, I don't consider Mika's a Greek restaurant any more.  And even with the conversion to wraps, they eliminated my usual Greek Night Club. Good bye."}
{"text":"Walking in, the restaurant is clean and well organized. The employees are very helpful with explaining dishes, especially is Greek is new to you. I love the fact that the kitchen is wide open. You can tell they take pride in their work, and the spotless kitchen exemplifies that.   Food is quick- by the time I got my soda from that really cool touchscreen soda fountain, my food was already done.  I order the regular pita with gyro meat, and a Greek salad. The salad was great- it had just enough dressing on it without being overpowering. The onions, tomatoes, and lettuce tasted freshly cut.   The pita was hot and fresh, and the tzatziki sauce was awesome! Everything tasted hot and fresh. The portions are adequate- not gut busting Chipotle burrito size, but the pita was plenty of food for a lunch on it's own.  Overall, this has been my favorite go-to for Greek, and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Incredibly clean place. The food was great one of the best Greek places in the area. Will eat here again and it's not to expensive."}
{"text":"Loved this place for lunch! The gyro meat was SO delicious and perfectly tender and moist (at every other greek place I've ever been to, it's always too dry and I have to smother it in tzatziki). I got the smaller plate option with gyro meat, and great price and portion size. My only complaint was the tomatoes--pinkish and definitely not at their peak. It seems to be a standard in the restaurant industry, but I don't understand why people use out-of-season tomatoes. I suppose, sadly, that's all some people know, but there are some types of produce that should only be used at their peak. However, my love of the gyro meat was so great, that it outweighed the tomatoes, and led to five stars."}
{"text":"The food was meh.  In my opinion it is very overpriced.  I ordered a an oreo cheesecake dessert and it took like 15 minutes to get and was something very old that seemed like they dug out of the bottom of a freezer."}
{"text":"Service and food is always great. The quality of their ingredients are great for Greek food. The salad is one of the freshest I've had from any Greek restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent service and really really good food! What a refreshing surprise to find a gem like this. They care about their food and you . Decor is nice and clean. Owner operated so you know he cares. My new favorite restraunt in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Awesome little Greek place!! I just moved in across the street & scored with this being my favorite food! I could live on hummus and theirs ROCKS!! The jalapeño hummus is superb! Best I've ever tasted & plain is excellent but has lots of garlic. Which is good for some & some not... I loved it!! Falafel is obviously homemade vs. Pasty mix. To go order was fast, easy & Christian gave great friendly reception!! Inside very nice, clean cut & a bit above average strip mall casual! Outdoor seating available. I'll be a regular...  Check them out!!  I would give 5 stars if they had Babaganoush!!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time last night, and man was I pleasantly surprised. I got the gyropeno and definitely was full after. They gave a generous portion of gyro meat as well as sauces. We took it to go, but the restaurant was very clean when we picked it up. The girl who rang us up was super nice and made small talk while I waited. I will definitely be back to try more of the menu :)"}
{"text":"Solid Greek food. Definitely better then a lot of the other Greek places around, probably the best I've had in central Phoenix (which isn't necessarily a complement). We live in the neighborhood so we were excited when this place opened up. They have obviously put some money into this place, taking down a couple of walls and completely remodeling the interior.   Food was good. Good tzatziki sauce, good meat on the gyro, overall pretty good. Fry's were good, not spectacular, but good. We hope this place has a chance to stick around for a while in this difficult spot, the neighborhood will be thankful to have good Greek food nearby."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch with my wife - really good food, cool interior, clean - will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We've been coming to this restaurant for over a year now so we're regulars. We're regulars because they ALWAYS do an amazing job! We love the staff especially the cashier and cook who always greets us and are very personable. The food is delicious! We get the platters to share or Mika's pita. Greekpeño is my fave but my gf loves the original. We've made a goal to eventually try everything but we definitely have our favorites. This is one of the best restaurants to get something fresh, delicious and healthy! I promise!"}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed in this place. :( I'm a huge greek food fan, and Mika's really missed the mark. We don't have many options in cen-pho, so I was hopeful Mika's would fit the niche we need...   The atmosphere: nice, I guess. It's a little odd.. almost too formal-type décor in a fast food setting. They clearly put some money and effort into renovations though, and I can appreciate that. One issue is space, and how there isn't much of it. They must do a lot of take out business because there were several groups of people waiting around for their food (read: blocking the soda fountain.)   The service: It's fast food style. You order at a counter and get a number, the food is brought out to you. The girl at the counter was nice. The time it took to get our food seemed unreasonably long. :/ eh.   The food: I fully admit that I am pregnant and will typically eat anything. I have a ravenous appetite and it doesn't take much pomp and circumstance to please me... But I was disappointed. I can only imagine the feelings of someone who isn't eating for two.   I ordered The Mediterranean chicken pita with their upgraded \"greek fries\" (fries with oil, seasonings, and feta on top) As soon as our food arrived I was disappointed by the obvious freezer fries. And the addition of a LOT of olive oil wasn't doing them any favors. Those little freezer fries soaked up that oil like a sponge. I like the idea of these toppings on fries, but you REALLY need to use fresh cut shoestring or thinner fries, not frozen steak fries.   The pita was just ok. The chicken was juicy (an upgrade from Athenian Express' dry chicken) but the flavor wasn't fantastic. It was amply filled, pita was fine. (might just be bagged and warmed though, didn't taste house-made) I will give them credit for the tzasiki sauce. It did taste authentic and homemade and I enjoyed it.   My husband ordered the chicken souvlaki (simply just chicken on skewers) and had the lentil soup side. The soup tasted canned. It was bland and the texre left much to be desired. The chicken skewers were literally just like, 8 chicken balls on a skewer with some greek seasoning sprinkled on and grilled. Hubby said they were not amazing. Just \"sort of green tasting dry-ish chicken on a stick.\"   I should probably mention the soda/fountain issues. :/ The ice dispenser wasn't working, so you have to get ice from the counter. Whatever. I got a sprite, and the soda is coming out of the fountain warm or something.. It was very weird. Much of the ice given to me was melty immediately, rendering the soda watered down and less than carbonated. Thinking initially that maybe the syrup was low on that one I replaced it with the Dr. Pepper (after getting more ice from the counter), and nope. That soda had to have been warm too, it caused the same issue. This probably wouldn't bother everyone, but I'm a connoisseur of fountain soda, so this cost Mika's some love for sure.   The rundown: We won't be back. Mika's has been open several months now, and that seems like enough time to have streamlined the issues we experienced. Plus, the food just wasn't that great and the price point wasn't on par for the quality. Sorry Mika's, I'll be going to Athenian Express and treating myself to MBFGR."}
{"text":"For fast casual Middle Eastern food this is a great find. The quality of lefts, which they call souvlaki, was outstanding. The gyros was a decent quality. The salads are fresh although the take on a village salad is idiosyncratic. The ice tea is also quite good. My only qualm was the pita, which was dry and lacked character. We also had a free geekumber appetizer, another idiosyncratic idea, which was ver good. The ambiance is pleasant as are the help. Some of  the music did not go with decor or eating. I guess it was a Pandora mix.  This is on of three stores for this local chain. My guess is we will return to one for a decent affordable meal. Besides they keep the place clean, and that is important when talking fast casual."}
{"text":"WOW. I am sitting here with a full belly, absolutely impressed with the meal I just had. Fresh, flavorful and not too heavy. If I hadn't eaten like a million of the french fries, it would probably pass as healthy.  The owner was really nice and my to-go order was up quickly. It's right next to British Open Pub, so I can see a few post-drink meals happening in my future!   Oh, the hummus was AMAZING. When I saw it I expected it to be a little gritty and bland, but it was anything but. It has a great flavor but not too lemony or garlicy. Can't put my finger on exactly what is so awesome about it, but it is. Actually, even now as I'm as uncomfortably full as I am, I'm thinking about having another bite of it..."}
{"text":"All in all a \"meh\" experience. It wasn't terrible but it certainly wasn't great. Our food was ready for pick up pretty quickly, which was nice, but the portion sizes were incredibly underwhelming. Flavor was good. I won't be going back, as there are several other Greek places in the valley with better flavor and fairer portions."}
{"text":"The small gyro platter with soup is a go-to lunch... hearty and always good."}
{"text":"Clean place and great food. Pricing is reasonable too. I had the gyro and Greek salad. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"My chicken souvlaki was excellent, great food, great value! Just picked from the current \"yelp\" reviews and it was as good as the other reviewers claimed. I also had the hummus which was great as well."}
{"text":"Service was great and friendly. This place was the cleanest restaurant I've ever been to. It looks like they just opened. I see other reviewers posting about the cleanliness, (which I found strange, but now I understand why). The food was great.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So delicious! Fresh grilled chicken and yummy salad! Owner is very attractive too :) should be open on Sundays though!"}
{"text":"Nice interior and nice music. However, I was not very impressed with the vegan options. I got the falafel pita and there were like 4 small pieces of tomato and 5 small pieces of onion, and 4 large falafel. I would opt for 3 falafel and lots more veggies."}
{"text":"I stopped in at the recommendation of a friend. Sounded good so I thought I'd give it a try. It must have been somewhere between lunch and dinner when I got there as the place was barren. Clean, not too large, and I was greeted as I walked in the door. High marks for that. The menus are high tech and on digital TV screens above your head. The cashier / owner gave me a moment to figure out what I wanted. Not being too hungry, I chose a Greek salad and some Greek fries. Both were delicious! Ordering to-go or to stay I made the assumption it would all be packaged the same, but I was wrong. Since I dine in, my food was brought to my table on China with metal silverware. It was unexpected and quite nice. I'm definitely going to go back for something more meaty. I highly recommend you do the same! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Got a Gyro and Greek Fries! Both very good! Place is very clean people working friendly. Was stopping at the Jimmy Johns next door seen this place decided to try it. Glad I did! Greek fries were awesome! Just the right amount of feta and dressing, fries still had a crunch to them!"}
{"text":"Excellent service,  great prices and my food was delicious.  I had a gyro with a Greek salad everything was very flavorful and fresh. I also had an order of hummus, regular and jalapeño.... they were both very good, although they don't give enough pita for how much hummus you get. Buy a couple extra.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I've going to the Scottsdale location for quite some time, I was in the area and was an easy decision to stop at my favorite Greek spot for lunch!"}
{"text":"I'll keep it short and simple: food is GREAT, cool ambiance, and they have a Coke Freestyle soda machine to top it off!"}
{"text":"Got a large meal two sides: Falafel and Gyro. Didn't get the gyro meat in my delivery so I can't say anything about it, but the falafel was extremely dry. Tasted like it was frozen and not freshly made. The fries were plain fries so don't waste your time on the upgrade because it's $1.25 to get them. The salad was very small and the lettuce was not fresh. Tzatziki sauce tastes bland..no flavor, missing garlic. If I had to do it again I'd pass. There's better food out there especially if you are ordering online paying for an up charge."}
{"text":"Excellent Greek food. Service was great and fast. The flavors were full and bold. I had a small platter with gyro meat and side Greek salad. My friend had the Diablo gyro. I will def. return."}
{"text":"When I first walked in I immediately noticed how clean the place was. Its obvious they take pride in their restaurant. Then the service was great, then the food came out in only a few mins, then the food was delicious. So I'll definitely be back. Thank you!"}
{"text":"CLEAN, GREAT GREEK FOOD.  Why am I shouting?  Mika's is that modern and clean.  Did I mention the great gryros!  The meat was moist.  Fresh pita bread and fries.  There are other good gyros in the valley but this tops them"}
{"text":"Love this place! Love the staff, the pitas, the lentil soup, Greek salad, Greek fries!"}
{"text":"Dewd! This place is THEEBOMB.com. Reasonably priced and the food is fresh and tasty, clean and efficient service. Pretty sure they know what they're doing. Whether you like Greek food or not, you must try it."}
{"text":"Delicious food! I had the Chicken Souvlaki and split the Mika's fries and they were both delicious. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love the food here, this is our go to place  for lunch or fast take out dinner. Do not get this place confused with Georges on McKellips  and Miller with failing health inspections."}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick bite to eat for lunch with vegetarian options near Barrow Neurological Institute. Found Mika's Greek on Yelp, which had good reviews.  I got the Greekpeño Pita with falafel and a side of soup. Really tasty quick and cheap Mediterranean food!  My falafel Pita came out in 5 minutes and was delicious! The falafels were perfect! Crunchy on the outside, soft and flavorful and even a bit spicy on the inside.  My lentil soup was piping hot and very tasty. Exactly what I was craving and perfect to wash down the Pita.  I chose to get takeout, but the restaurant itself looked very inviting and was pretty full around lunchtime.  Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food. Clean establishment and the portions are good size. I will definitely try this joint again, and try something new."}
{"text":"Best Greek in the area, definitely number one spot for me! I typically go for the Greekpeño pita with falafel usually a salad to go with, but sometimes those fries are too tempting to pass up. Always with      a side of tzatziki. The Falafel is perfect, not dry at all and with lots of flavor. Boyfriend  gets a Mediterranean pita with gyro meat. (Huge plus, they slice their meat here). They offer classic cola and sprite glass bottles. A favorite option :) the guys at the counter are so nice and helpful. The interior is comfy, modern, and clean. Great lunch spot! The consistent deliciousness keeps us coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Greek in town! Quick service, always great food whether you dine-in or take-out, clean and modern atmosphere. One of my favorites! The Scottsdale location is amazing too!"}
{"text":"I live around the corner from Mikas and have enjoyed dining there probably over 20 times.  The other day i went there for dinner as usuall and for some reason the gyro meat was extremely salty.  I went and asked for a tziki sauce to calm down my gyro, and was told that they cost 82 cents.  I reluctantly handed over my card, and was quickly told that they cannot accept card under 1 dollar.  I told the young lady i do not have any cash, and she basically said i was sol.  I could buy 2 for my half of a gyro i had left.  This was the worst customer service i have seen in awhile and after being a long time customer it was like a slap in the face.  I know 82 cents but that goes both ways.  I will not be going back!"}
{"text":"I am so happy I got a chance to stop by here during my short time in Phoenix. I was able to get some lunch here during work and ordered a pita with their grilled beef. So delicious! I ended up getting the spicier one as well with jalapeños and was quite surprised on how much of a kick it had. Their white sauce was delicious. They're also really reasonable and would definitely recommend for lunch or getting a Greek fix!"}
{"text":"Used the reliable GrubHub to have Mika's Greek gyro and greek fries delivered to my hotel nearby.  The BEST gyro with extra gyro beef - I ordered the one with jalepenos and really wanted them to be grilled with grilled green peppers and onions but instead all of the veggies were raw. It was still amazing and since I wasn't specific on my order I couldn't hold it against them.  The fries were barely cooked but the feta and seasoning on top were delish."}
{"text":"Right around the corner from where I work. Food is delicious, and comes out pretty quickly. Great place for the lunch hour rush.  Also, always very nice staff, and  very clean."}
{"text":"Ok, just working on training myself on Yelp reviews as I have been using the app for years but not participating, yeah I know shame on me!  Anyways I am jumping all in.  Mikas Greek does have EXCELLENT GYROS, I have the original and it was great, not really greasy, came with a nice side salad.  Because I saw another guy rave about the Mikas fries I went for it it I kept the blue cheese and wish I didn't, to over the top and really makes it to strong, besides that I thought they were ok.   I was charged .75 for taiki sauce which was kind of bogus should be included.  Staff was great and very clean place- this place is a go"}
{"text":"It's pretty good. The seating//dining area could use a little enhancement but the food is about right for the price. Good falafel!"}
{"text":"Today I visited mikas Greek and the area was very clear the service was very very good the food was very amazing good quality and good price. In my opinion I recommend this restaurant to everyone. Thanks for everything, Daniel..!!"}
{"text":"Food was good and ready when asked for. We called our order in and were pleased with the prompt availability. I gotta say that what we paid for our meal though, I was a little underwhelmed. The salad was fresh and crisp, the appetizers were good, and the gyro was tasty. But nothing spectacular or out of the ordinary to warrant the cost. I may try this place again just to be sure ..."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time a week ago and I was really impressed. Everything was really fresh. I had the Gyro plate with rice. You can tell that they do really care about there customers. I can tell it was really clean and new. This place was built off tradition. Great place to stop into you want to get something fresh and quick."}
{"text":"Nicholas Greek restaurant has a  rather hip vibe to it. Very pleasant to be in. Staff was courteous and accommodating. We ordered gyros, domaldes,  souvlaki, Greek salad, lentil soup, and Greek chicken.  The good: gyros and Greek salads were tasty. To be improved: The chicken was a bit dry. The souvlaki was overlooked, uninspired hamburger. The domaldes (stuffed grape leaves) were small and vegetarian without taste. The lentil soup was hot but low on flavor.  To get to the next level, Mika's should retain the services of somebody's Greek mother! Jim-The Critic"}
{"text":"This is my year of Small Businesses and Mom and Pops.  And wowzah!  I am so happy I've decided to seek out businesses with fewer than 50 reviews to give my business.   Here I am strolling Yelp and this gem pops up.  I order a Tabouli salad (add lamb) and a side of the Greek fries.  I am a goof ball.  I try saying a few of the words I learned in Greece, but the cashier wasn't from Greece, so we had a good laugh at my expense.  So, on to the food.... They gave me a tabouli salad with lamb.... And no knife.  Hmm...  I think to myself.... \"Oh no, I should have asked it it was \"ground lamb\"....\"  Boy I was in for a surprise.  I was treated to the most deliciously seasoned tender chunks of lamb.  No Fork Required!  Each savory bite of the chunks of lamb were mouth-wateringly delicious.  The Greek fries with feta and parsley with tzatziki sauce were crispy, hot and fantastic too.  I must come back to try their moussaka!  Return Factor: 80%"}
