{"text":"La nourriture était excellente, J ai mangé Le meilleur filet mignon que j avais mangé depuis longtemps.  Notre serveur était très attentionné .  Le décor est superbe.  Merci pour la belle soirée!!!"}
{"text":"Good service. Good steak. A bit young and generic. But a decent start to the night for non-locals. Overpriced but what do you expect from a tourist town.  Worth coming for the beef tataki and filet mignon. Martini was sub par."}
{"text":"Good service and good food. Maybe a little bit overpriced but the place is nice. Fancy with house music in the background. Anyway, I recommend that restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is incredible. The service is very detailed and friendly. You can run up a good bill easily. However, this is a top quality place worth the price. I have been twice and I highly recommend it. (You may want to try the grilled salmon!)"}
{"text":"My husband ans I both had caesar salad and the filet mignon .... Was the best ever and very good service with Yannick.Would highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Honestly the food was the best I have ever eaten in st-sauveur. The menu goes from simple to very well crafted masterpieces...tartars and meats are to die for!!! The place is beautiful and the music was perfect. Once the lights go down and the dj starts playing, Marabou becomes a different type of beast! Best place north of Montreal by far!!!"}
