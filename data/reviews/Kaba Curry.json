{"text":"I'm not typically a fan of \"fusion\" but I really enjoyed Kaba Curry. If you think it's traditional Japanese curry then you're missing the point."}
{"text":"I order the pork katsu.  i thought the pork was cooked pretty good.  the curry sauce was tasty and the price is reasonable.  i think of this place more for lunch than i do for dinner."}
{"text":"Let's get something out in the open: I absolutely love Japanese curry. I hadn't been able to try Kaba Curry at any of the food festivals it had been at, so I had been waiting in great anticipation for opening day of their (difficult to find) B&M location. I have to give these 3 budding entrepreneurs a lot of credit for trying, and truth be told, I really really wanted to like this place. Unfortunately, I am a Japanese curry snob, and just like so many of its brethren in town, Kaba doesn't make the grade. Its curry is way too watery and the spices far too subdued. It's also a bit too sweet for my taste. The chicken katsu is too small for charging $7. At a comparable counter-style curry joint in LA, you can get a heaping plate of curry rice with a chicken katsu at least 3 times as large and a side salad all for less than $6. It was also odd that it took 20 minutes to get my order. Shouldn't the curry and rice be all ready to go and the katsu take a few minutes to deep fry? I don't understand what took so long. It's not like they were busy.  At any rate, it's nothing personal guys. I wish you the best of luck, but I've got to tell it how it is. In my mind, if you want the best Japanese curry (that I've tasted so far), you've got to schlepp it all the way to Curry House in LA. I eagerly await the day when you can get great curry without leaving town."}
{"text":"Man I had the Chicken Katsu Kaba Curry with rice, corn and spinach and it was SOOOOOOO good! You sleepin if u aint eatin Kaba Curry! The best i have ever had!"}
{"text":"This is a very good place to eat, it's where I go to get my curry fix. The only problem I have with it is they are closed when everything else says they are open"}
{"text":"Was ok ...not wowed!   4 drinks that I wanted they were out of.   They also ran out of straws.   A place that only does curry should be well stocked.   I mean you don't have to order much.   First impression not having most basic things is kinda bad.    The curry was good but tasted like the one from the box at the grocery store.  The fried rice was mushy and tasteless.  The croquet and corn beef hash was good.  Spam katsu tasted burnt and was brown....looked old...everything on the plate was brown....even though I ordered extra curry it was still kinda little bit.  Felt like they just gave you enough to cover the plate.  And you pay .50 for spice, which is kinda weird."}
{"text":"I Lived in Japan for 3 years and been to a lot curry places.  I must  say Kaba Curry brings a fun and tasty meal with their own twist to traditional Japanese curry in Vegas.    The flavors will remind you of CoCo Ichiban, a must check out spot."}
{"text":"Their curry is amazing! It's Japanese curry rather than Indian style (not a big fan of Indian curry). They add new stuff all the time, and all of their new items are delicious. They even offer discounts for students and special offers for their regular customers. They always ask for feedback to make sure you're enjoying the food or if you need anything else.  The food portion is great and the staff is really nice. Each food item really complements the other along with their drinks (big fan of the plum ramune and melon soda). They bring your food to you, which really gives it that nice dining experience.   On special occasions, they play some really nice music. It's a great place to meet up with friends and they always make sure everyone is having a good time.   Make sure you check it out! Especially if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I was informed that it's not similar to Coco ichibanya: Curry House back home in hawaii, but I still held on a little bit hoping it was close. after getting my food, it wasn't disappointing (it was REALLY good) but it reminded me of Daichi Ramen's curry.  Portions were alright and the service was good, she checked up pretty often and took care of us well.  Only thing was the wait time, we had a party of 14 and they had 3 or 4 people working in the kitchen. I know what it's like to work in the food industry and it can be somewhat frustrating to have such a sudden rush come in, so that's why I was pretty lenient with waiting.  Main verdict, I would definitely come here again. First impressions were good and the food was good as well, looking forward to filling out my stamp card!"}
{"text":"I would do 2.5 stars if I could make it that way.   So lets start off with the good. Taste of the food? Pretty good. Very similar to most Japanese restaurant's curry. Whatever is fried stayed crispy. Nothing bad, but nothing extraordinary either.   Service was good.  I felt like their prices were a little high considering their portion sizes. Everyone knows that everything in Hawaii is more expensive than the mainland. However, I could get the same curry plate that's double the portion, still for cheaper than kaba curry. Simple things like just adding a little more rice or more curry sauce would just \"make\" the plate look fuller and make customers feel like they're getting a great deal. Rice and sauce are the most inexpensive things in a restaurant so I don't feel like people need to be stingy with those. Just a little comparison: at ichiza their beef curry is around $8 (loaded with beef, vegetables, and rice) and I can never finish it all and always have some lunch for tmrw as well. Here...I paid the same price for basically just curry sauce, rice, and katsu and I cleaned the plate off and still felt hungry.   The atmosphere here can get super awkward as well! I don't wanna offend ppl into that \"cosplay\" world but....I felt like this restaurant was a mini convention for that! Everyone in there were in bright colored wigs, dressed up like anime, or playing magic cards! It wasn't even Halloween! We were the only \"normal\" customers there. It was just awkward! And it seems like they're the friends of the owners too cuz they even go behind the counter freely. I felt like I was in another world and I just wanted to finish my food and leave. I mean, if you're into those kinda things or you don't mind that the place is packed with cosplay ppl then sure maybe you'll like the atmosphere. But it wasn't for me.   I'll stick to ichiza. More food for the buck and I don't feel like I'm in another world there."}
{"text":"I really like this location. The place is very spacious. There is music playing in the background, which has its own atmosphere.   The food is really good, especially the udon, which i like to order a lot. I like the portion size because you will not feel guilty not leaving any behind. You can customize your order, so it will not be the same old thing you ordered in the past. The prices are reasonable since you can figure how much you want to spend. There are plenty of different drinks, plate combos, to desserts.   It does take awhile to get the food to you, but having a group of friends with you will pass the time, then you notice you food being served. It is worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I've watched this small one window shop grow into an awesome restaurant. The service is always great, the owners and servers are friendly and will most def remember you when you come back! :) The food is innovative, has an island flair and so very tasty. I come back often. I never leave without having the chantilly kaba cakes. Mmmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"Walked in on a thurs night and it was not busy whatsoever. A friend and I were the only ones seated in the actual restaurant area while there were about several others already eating/drinking at the bar. Food took literally 35 minutes, let me remind you, we were the only ones in the seating area of the restaurant. Expecting it to be AMAZING considering the wait time, instead left very disappointed.   Tonkatsu: skimped portions Marinated beef: tasted and looked like simple ground hamburger, nothing special  Curry: prob the best thing on the plate; but was quite skimped as well   Not to mention, food came out cold. Save your time and goto Zenn curry. Sry Kaba, I don't thjnk I will be back again!"}
{"text":"i have ate food  from around the world even curry but these guys at kaba curry make the best curry i ever had somthing about it can make my taste buds yell with joy so i give these guys 10 thumbs up"}
{"text":"Service & Staff is wonderful, easy to find, clean establishment, and the food of course is delicious. This place is a big hit with my kids. Will definitely be back for more of their Japanese curry with a splash of Hawaiian flavor."}
{"text":"They offered tap water without ice because their ice machine was broken. The Curry was watery. The plain white rice was edible and the chicken katsu by itself was good.  But I probably wont return, to each his own just not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of Japanese Curry, you will enjoy Kaba.  Lived in Japan many years and yearn for curry every once in awhile.  Kaba does a great job recreating the familiar curry found in curry houses across Japan.  The tonkatsu (pork cutlet) was tender and tasty.  The potato croquette was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The curry has a nice kick to it.  It is aromatic and tasty.  They are just starting out in their location near CSN so don't let the counter service/cafeteria environment scare you away.  I got mine to go.  It was packed up nicely and still warm when I got home.  Serving portion could be a bit larger but still found the meal a good value.  Give it a try, you will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Kaba Curry is the best curry. Everything here is great! Recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"I was having a craving for curry and had the need to fulfill it. I heard so much about this place that I decided to give it a try.  Thursday night and this place was not busy whatsoever. We were able to take a seat wherever we liked and received very fast service. Unfortunately some of the things on the menu were being discontinued and the prices of fountain drinks were being raised, but our server kindly informed us all of this. He didn't rush us at all while taking our order and was very patient with us - something I greatly appreciate when receiving customer service.   As we were waiting for our food, we were able to play tic-tac-toe on the tabletops. I thought this was pretty cool and an innovative way to keep people busy as they wait for their food. The environment of this place is very casual and modern, and the atmosphere is very laid back.   As for the food, it was very delicious. I've only tried a few Japanese curry houses in Vegas, but this is honestly the best one I've been too. The curry tastes yummy, and there is a wide selection of toppings and sides you can get with your curry. You can even choose a spice level if you want. They even have a few already made dishes if you're feeling a bit indecisive for that day. Everything is pretty affordable too, so I would recommend this place for those who don't want to spend too much money for a decent meal. I do feel like the portions could be a bit bigger though since I ran out of curry before finishing all of my rice. It's not the best Japanese curry I ever had, for it's a bit of a thinner consistency. But for Vegas, it's a spot I would recommend. Overall, I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with some friends. Their first time too. Had a fried who loved this place a lot so decided to try it.   Interior was painted yellow with bench seats along the wall and pull out chairs on the other side. pretty spacious. probably could fit a few more tables if they needed to.  Came here for dinner around 5:30. Pretty empty. We were the only table aside from one other guy, which i think was a DJ?   Their menu is fairly simple. First row, you get your pick of either Rice + Curry, Cheese Fries + Curry, Fried Rice + Curry, and Curry Udon. Second row, you have a choice of spice level (if you want it spicy, regular is non-spicy) for a charge of 50 cents. Third section is the sides, which ranges from like chicken katsu, to sausages, etc for average 2-3 dollars per side (with no limit to how many sides you can get of course, as long as you are willing to pay XD). Fourth section is the toppings like corn, mushrooms, etc. Bottom section is the drinks.   Simple and easy. Pick your selection as you go down the sections and you have your order.   NOTE ! With Yelp check in - free side and topping ! Saves you like 3-4 bux if you get katsu and a side !   I had gotten the cheese fries + curry with chicken katsu and a fried egg (with the imagination of it being an over easy egg so if i broke it, the yummy gooey yolk will flow over the katsu and fries !!! )   When the order came, i was actually a little surprised on how small it was. I had no expectation on the size beforehand but i guess i was hoping it be larger because i was hungry XD ! Fries were nice and crispy. Curry itself, was nice. Not super seasoned like some other curries i have but it was ok (not too much of a fan of japanese curry). Was gonna add spicy to it but decided against it because i like to try the original flavor before any changes =P As i had said before, i had ordered an egg but the egg was a little too cooked compared to what i had hoped for. Was maybe \"over medium\" vs the over easy i wanted XD no ooey gooey goodness to go over my stuff =[ sad haha jk kinda =X lol the best thing, to my surprise was the chicken katsu. despite it being a $3 (if not free from yelp check in), you get 1 piece of chicken katsu. What had surprised me was how juicy and moist the chicken was. Props to the chef/owner on pulling that off !!   Overall, not bad experience. Wished portions was bigger XD"}
{"text":"Tried this place out at the filipino festival. I heard some good things so I checked it out. bought the Chicken katsu curry. This place definetely does have some of the best curry i've ever had in my life. The potato croquette that I ordered was nice, hot and smooth potatoes. The rice was well cooked as well. The only thing I didn't like was the chicken katsu was overcooked and dry. But they do have an amazing curry."}
{"text":"This place is so yummy! Being an extremely picky eater, I was very hesitant to try this place. I had never had any type of curry before, and didn't know what to expect. But my old boss convinced me to try it. And I really love it! I'm not a curry connoisseur, this is the only place I've ever eaten it at, but it's awesome.  Plus, everyone who works here is extremely friendly, and even remember my name (which is awesome). They're always extremely patient with me as I struggle to decide between Chicken Katsu and Steamed Veggies (my two favorites) and even offer suggestions to help me be a little more adventurous :-)"}
{"text":"THIS. IS. THE. SPOT.  The owner is super chill, fun, and laid back. He's usually there when I go for dinner and it's an open late spot. Sometimes they've got a DJ jamming it out for the peeps.   Long review short, it's a bomb place with bomb food and a hint of hawaiian favorites as wellz. Ayyyye!"}
{"text":"This place isn't that food but the people but tonight very disappointed. There closing hours are 11pm. Called at 10pm to make an order. They said there closed because there slow. I asked what time you close they said 11 but closed early because no customers. Bad business."}
{"text":"This place is 3.5 stars for me, but as it doesn't get as much attention as Curry Zen, I decided to boost by rounding up to 4 stars for them.  Honestly, Curry Zen offers superior quality, but Kaba Curry is also decent to my Japanese taste buds.  My suggestion for them is to simplify the offerings - focus on the best menu items that you're proud of, then try to do it even better. Loco moco style curry is pretty good, but some toppings like tonkatsu was subpar. The inconsistency in the quality makes you look worse than you actually are."}
{"text":"First off - I love Kaba Curry's cute hippo mascot (Kaba is hippo in Japanese by the way).  Kaba Curry is located in a cafeteria like location on Charleston near the College of Southern Nevada's (CSN) north campus along with other college friendly vendors for Korean food, Mexican, boba drinks and chicken wings.  Seems as though they've got the right idea:  FEED THE HUNGRY COLLEGE KIDS WITH COMFORT FOOD, otherwise it's pretty empty in the evening once all the students have gone home.   Between the three of us we got pork katsu/Tonkatsu, chicken katsu, sausage and potato croquette.  The shining star of the set was actually the potato croquette.  It was fried to a golden crisp.  Huge crunch on the outside and creamy potatoey on the inside.  The curry sauce wasn't bad too, and the chicken and pork were not dry and quite tasty.  Conclusion:  They may be empty in the evenings now, but I think word will soon spread.  Get your Japanese curry fix before there are lines out the door!  $ to Value Ratio:  3.75/5 Stars Yummy Factor: 3.75/5 Stars Texture Satisfaction: 5/5 Stars Average stars: 4.16 Stars"}
{"text":"Great music, good vibe, cool people.   Oh yea, the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Yum ... loved the Chantilly Kabacakes!  Brought my order back to the office & hid away, like a little kid, taking tiny bites of the steamed chocolate minicakes hoping the thrill would last longer.  I'm from Hawaii & I know awesome Chantilly cream frosting with toasted mac nut sprinkles when I taste it ... this real deal is Ono-licious!  Oh yeah, I was so distracted thinkin bout the dessert I almost forgot to review the curry which is the denser, yet savory apple-spiced Japanese style curry.  Had mine on a fried rice base (rice speckled with morsels of egg & bits of portuguese sausage so you get a taste of everything with each forkful), plus a good sized topping of tonkatsu/panko pork cutlet topping.  Tasty comfort food.  Nice service.  I'll be baaaccckkk!"}
{"text":"Uh, I was expecting something like Curry House back home in Hawaii, especially considering the decor looked like a downgraded version, but I was awfully disappointed. I had the curry udon with chicken karage and the portions were pretty small, for the price you pay definitely not worth it. The chicken karage also tasted funny. All in all, I probably would not come back."}
{"text":"This place okay.....kind of disappointed. Got my food but it seemed like they warm the curry  in the microwave cause mine was maybe a little warmer than Luke warm. Curry is suppose to be HoT man!  The food is not bad but a couple of stars deducted for so so service and pretty much cold curry. I really wanted to like this place. .. try again some day."}
{"text":"Ehh..   Nothing life changing.   I've tried to eat here four times.. and three of them, they were closed. (While store hours claim to be open) Apparently ran by younger people and the place closes early on a Saturday?! Isn't that the number one day you should be open late?!   Anyways, you walk in and its kind of awkward, its a very wide open room.. such a waste of space! Granted that they aren't busy you could use that space for tables and what not. We sat down, placed our order, and here it comes! Man, it's really not that bad but I would absolutely prefer to eat at Curry Zen. The curry is watery and with the added cheese I'm not sure if I could even find it! I got the corn beef which was bomb! Curry Zen needs to get on that haha. Also had the korroke.. soooooo sad. It tasted like boxed taters with garlic powder nothing spectacular. It's ok, I can't say that I would go back as long as Zen stays open.  Sad, that owner comments on reviews will always sway your decision making.."}
{"text":"I remember the first time i've had Japanese Curry. A few guys i met in the barracks invited me to go with them on their weekly dinner ritual. I agreed and was happy to ditch the barracks room and see a little of the city past the gate. Long story short my first Japanese curry was a chicken katsu at level 1 spiciness from a Japanese franchise chain of curry houses which i cant remember the name of.   Japanese curry is something A LOT different from other curries such as Indian or Thai. It's a lot different from the Vietnamese style curries i'm used to eating at home too. The curry is thicker and pure from other ingredients, usually, and is flavored a bit heavier but smoother as well.   Now back to the present and i find myself FINALLY in front of Kaba Curry and they're fully equip to give me something more than a sample cup (First time i ran into these guys was at aniMEGAcon). Ordered a Chicken Katsu with spinach as a topping and thanks to the Yelp app i was awarded another free topping, ended up with mushroom.  Before i ate i already had an opinion of the curry and already decided that it wasnt going to be true authentic Japanese curry. After the first bite i pretty shocked from how non-authentic it was. Then i recalled the ordering process. Anthony, one of the owners/partners, never asked if i wanted it spicy. The first initial flavor was curry then a subtle sweet smoothness at the end.  After the shock of realizing this REALLY wasnt what i was expecting at all i started to enjoy it to the point where i was scraping the to-go box for every grain of rice down to the last drop of curry.   The rice was perfectly cooked, moist, and fluffy. Anthony tells me brown rice is in the works so look out for it in the future (yay!).  The curry wasn't what i was expect but who needs expectations when it's just that good?  The Katsu chicken was very good on it's own. Light breaded and crispy exterior with a moist center of white meat chicken breast.   I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"So Kaba Curry shit its door and closed it's shutters over at the Campus Commons for the last time as the crew moved over to a new location. Much personal anticipation for their return due to withdraws and lo and behold the NEW Kaba Curry is open on Spring Mountain right next to Basic Chicken n Beer.   A few new things on the menu, most noticeably are the Shoyu Chicken (havent tried it yet) and the Corned Beef Patty.  Now i know what you're thinking: 'dafaq is a corned beef patty??' It's exactly that...A burger patty of corned beef (canned i think) that's deep fried. How's it taste? Pretty damn good actually! The saltyness of it goes well to balance out the curry.   Overall nothing's changed very much with Kaba Curry except for the new location as well as a few things on the menu. This is a big step for the small local business and it gives us a unite opportunity to watch them grow as a business.

{"text":"Kaba curry was bomb! Had it a few weeks ago but forgot to write a review. Got the loco moco. Dig it."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Japanese style curry in Vegas! \^^/"}
{"text":"My weekly retreat for a curry foodgasm. Any Hawaii locals who miss Curry House owes it to themselves to try Kaba Curry. This restaurant was not started by profit hungry people, but rather like-minded curry enthusiasts. Choose your base plate between white rice, udon, fries, or fried rice, then add on your favorite toppings. Occasionally they experiment with new food types such as the curry grilled cheese, which you can then try if its on their Secret Sunday menu. Be sure to follow them on Facebook or twitter to get those notifications!"}
{"text":"The salad dressing was good, greens a little bitter but in was okay with that.  The curry is a good japanese style curry.  If you are looking for an exact replica of CoCo Ichibanya, you should keep looking."}
{"text":"I wanted too write another review for the curry udon. Every since the CMYE kaba curry night whenever have the itch for japanese curry only place on my mind. I went back for the traditional chicken katsu curry and kaba cakes. This time around I wanted too get full bowl of the curry udon. OMG! No more tease but nice full bowl of udon noodles on cold night. It slurping heaven! The udon noodles cooked too perfection, nice and hot, the curry broth alone meal by itself (nice hearty broth full of flavor), and add topping or sides. Course had too get chicken katsu for my side. Add a big bowl (curry udon) of dipping sauce for chicken katsu. Tough decision were too start the noodles, straight broth, chicken katsu, or both or all. Anyway not get enough curry from Kaba Curry. I finally remember too use my check in for one free topping! =)"}
{"text":"I have always been fan of Kaba Curry back at there old location and feel like there japanese curry reminds me local style back in da islands. Recently they moved too this new location. I had no idea because went too the old location thinking too myself \"Nooo\" favorite curry house is gone. I asked guys at Wing King told me just moved too new location on spring mountain. I had my hesitation thinking ok big move on its own, bigger, and thinking the quality and service stays the same? Thankfully everything is STILL on point and have nothing but praise small business taking it too another level.   Compare too the old location its refreshing that you truly feel in restaurant restaurant not food court. The decor keep it simple but elegant in its simplicity!  Still has Kaba Curry logo. some cool artwork with japanese writing, like bar stool area (hold around six), and still get free topping with your yelp checkin. I was happy that they still do the stamp cards.   The food the base curry on all the food is awesome! This visit I had the Local Kaba Moco never had before. Talk about Winnah! It was exactly what you think local moco style with the hamburger, rice, and fried egg all topped with curry. The hamburger not only was it fresh made burgers but like the touch of diced onions in the hamburger. Everything was perfect compliment on top the other. The menu was small only because they did not have there grand opening till this weekend. The base of there menu will still be the same you choose your sides or toppings and base it on rice or udon noodles or something else not too sure. One thing I am sure is Kaba Curry really has best Curry in town. I love the depth of flavor every time and fact that can mix it up keeps it fresh.   The service is wonderful. One of the owners came out asking me about \"How did I find out about the place?\" I like always been fan went too the old location heard they moved. I wanted too come check out the new location. Happy for them. Happy that my favorite Curry (Kaba Curry) is still here and closer too my house so will be making more visits!!"}
{"text":"The owners of Kaba Curry are really awesome and inventive.  I have had Coco's Curry in Hawaii and don't remember liking it.  My friends invited me here and the menu offerings are similar. To my surprise I really enjoyed the food here.  The curry grilled cheese is simple and tasty. Dip your fries in the curry... Yum. I love roti and usually have it with a yellow curry. The version they have here is pretty good, different not as sweet.  The Gyoza are made with shrimp we also dipped it in the curry of course!  Tried the loco moco.  I really like that the onions are cooked in the burger patty. They ordered the chicken katsu over rice and curry.  The chicken was very clean, just meat with the crunchy coating. And by far the best thing on the menu  is the chantilly kaba cakes.  They steam it and the chocolate cake is so soft. The sauce is like a smoother less sweet consistency compared to condensed milk.  For sure coming here again!"}
{"text":"great curry. simple. tastes good. they have a few other things you could add if you want like extra chicken or corn. theres more but i dont remember. the owner is really friendly. if it wasnt so far from my house id get their curry more often."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem when it comes to curry. I heard about this from a friend and decided to come eat here. This place is inside of a \"food court\" type building. I was chatting up with the cashier who happen to be the owner. He was very nice and friendly and very much so wanted feedback to improve. The menu is simplistic in which it is a ala carte type style.   The curry was very good. I had the tonkatsu with coquette. I love curry and this place definitely was satisfying. I would come back here."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Japanese curry.  Kaba Curry is alright for the value, but it certainly isn't my favorite in town.    I had eaten at the old location a while ago and honestly remembered liking it a little more. The curry sauce itself has an enjoyable flavor to it and they offer a nice variety of options--several of which will do in a pinch, but none that entice me to come back to them. Fans of udon noodles can get Curry Udon...that's something you don't find everywhere, but not a big enough draw for me.  Like the 3 Stars say, they're \"A-OK.\" There are better options in walking distance though which make me think I will not be coming back anytime soon.  Kaba Curry is open late--2am late...so if you are in the mood for Japanese Curry and it is after 11pm when all the other shops have closed down it would behoove you stop in for a late-night bite.   The staff is nice, but the small kitchen can get backed up in a hurry. Expect a wait if there are even a few orders ahead of you...or if you are a part of a large party.  Come here for late night Japanese Curry... Come here late while the DJ is playing for an atypical dining experience... Come here if you're a twenty-something on a budget... Expect to wait if you come here and find other patrons..."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try kaba curry ever since they were at their old location on charleston.. I'm glad they relocated to china town!  I ordered the curry&rice... And I added on karoke and shrimp. I also used the yelp offer and added corn. It was really good! It took a little long for my food to be made... But it was worth the wait! I left w a happy tummy and happy wallet! :) I will be back"}
{"text":"Not only was the food absolutely amazing, but the service is great here! One of the owners (tall black guy, sorry didnt get your name) as our server and he was so helpful, nice and funny! Will absolutely come back again! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Satisfied my cravings but it's far off from any other establishment that made me want to come back and give it another go.  Ambiance: 3/5 About 5 booth style seating options, and 2 random two top tables with what looked like a DJ set up near the entrance.   I honestly didn't get the vibe or the concept of the decor if there was any. During our wait time, it felt more like a frat house than anything.   Food: 4/5 We ordered the custom curry dishes with spice levels 2-3. The portion of rice is more than generous to be quite honest (previous comments stated the portion was small).  The flavor was amazing, and the chicken was Full Of Flavor and juicy. Presentation had nothing going but it didn't matter much as I devoured the dish completely.  I noticed a family sat down after we did and immediately got back up and left. FYI it's a custom curry style restaurant with a small section of non curry items. For the most part it's all curry built how you like.   Service: 3/5 Based on the reviews I'm going to assume the gentleman working the front of the house is the owner and there's a one man show in kitchen, which is probably why the food took longer than usual to come out. The gentleman was very nice and sincere about a few items on the menu not being available.   I over heard a family near us order their Roti Canai which didn't come till the end of their meal. Down the road at Malaysian Island Cuisine, their Roti Canai came out quick.    Overall, don't expect much. However expect good Japanese curry when you feel like having some."}
{"text":"The curry here was OK, Paid for extra topping but only got 4 leafs. sigh. But used my iDcard and got a discount 20% OFF entire bill which is pretty cool."}
{"text":"I found out about this place by accident while searching for food trucks around town and man I'm glad I did! I made my way over on a Saturday night and we were greeted by the very friendly girl at the counter. The ordering process is very easy and it's all displayed nicely on the screen on the side. We got the curry base, which is rice with their standard curry and added chicken katsu and spinach. The other dish we got was the loco kaba moco which is rice, hamburger patty, egg and instead of gravy like usual it's covered in curry. We had a little bit of a long wait but it was well worth it once we got our food!   The curry was very flavorful and had some heat to it but nothing overwhelming. Everything was cooked perfect and had so much flavor! The girl working the front (I wish I asked her name!) also offered us a dessert they were testing out which was a take on a traditional Hawaiian dessert, the base was a chocolate cupcake split in half filled with a condensed milk mixture and topped with macadamia nuts, ugh it was SO good!! I hope they add it to the menu.  So, needless to say I was very impressed by my first visit and the great customer service. I definitely recommend trying it out if you've been thinking about it! :)"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place out for a few weeks now.  I finally got to try it!  It was empty with the exception of a table of people having a meeting and another table.  The server was nice and patient.  My daughter and hubs can sometimes be indecisive and they were also out of some menu items.    Service was great and the food was yummy.  I had the rice and curry with chicken katsu and Japanese sausage.  I opted for a little bit spicier than the regular curry and added corn.  It was delicious.  My hubs and daughter opted for no curry with rice and had spam katsu, kimchi, pickled scallions, and egg rolls.  I can't remember what else hubs ordered.  All in all, we will probably be back!  =)"}
{"text":"I love this place. Reminds me of curry house in Hawaii. Nice people. Will definitely be back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I discovered this place by accident at STREATS last year and loved it. I was so excited when they opened a brick and mortar location. The food is simple but delicious. The curry is what makes it all, it almost smells as good as it tastes. I like the Katsu with corn, it adds a little crunch."}
{"text":"Best curry place by far in Vegas! AND they had spam katsu! Which I've been craving for for so long (been searching for a good curry place that has it too) Food was soooo good & loved that we could pick whatever we wanted to go along with the curry. Staff & service was good too! definitely coming back"}
{"text":"The food was edible but it was not so great, I don't know if it was an off day or what but I got the Tonkatsu Curry Rice with corn and it was mediocre, the curry was lukewarm and the corn was cold, I didn't like that so much..the taste...well it was edible but I've had better curry...not my go to place"}
{"text":"Back in the day, any kid in Hawaii seen more than a few of Shotaro Ichinomori's super heroes show, and Kikaida and Kamen Rider was our biggest  treat on a Saturday evening.  After the success of these shows,  a few more series started coming to our picture tube at home.   Then one of the biggest Japanese cross-over shows came out as Gorenger, which was later bought for the fight scenes for  the Mighty morphin power rangers series.    Well, in Gorenger, there was the Yellow Ranger who ate curry like it was 1999....and If I had a Chance, I would be going off like that guy at Kaba.  First of all, I love curry!   It can be Japanese or Thai, but being from Hawaii, I have a slight favor for Japanese style curry, and I can make a pot of it, and eat it for three day straight days of ; breakfast, Lunch, and dinner.    So I was pretty happy to see a brick and molter Japanese Curry joint in Las Vegas.    I'll have to admit,  I hardly turn down this part of Charleston, and usually stay on Rainbow, so I sadly missed the turn into their parking lot because of a large brushes that hides the turn into this place,  and I had to make U-turn back..  Oh well, it was no big deal, but I was staving hard  and made a hard U, and turned back.    When I got there, it was past 9 pm, and Kaba was the only restaurant opened in the building, and I was greeted nicely by one of the owners.   The menu is pretty straight forward, and I picked out a Beef curry with a side of potato croqette.    Within five minutes, I got my plate, and I have to say it was pretty good!    I was trying to figure out what was the sweetness to this recipe, and believe it was graded apples.    The plate wasn't the biggest plate, I ever had, but the base price was good.    Being from Henderson, would I make a special trip to eat here again?  maybe not, but If I'm in the area, it might an idea to make it a visit."}
{"text":"Ive been coming here since they first opened up and ive been coming once a week since then,They have a great vibe to be in and a great mix of wonderful homemade food.I even get Kaba cravings all the time, all their desserts they make are great ,I glad to see them grow and watch their dream go along with the menu."}
{"text":"Love their curry! I like the fact that all the veggies are chopped up small. I personally do not like big chunks of them sitting in my curry.. i've tried chicken katsu and karaage as topping, and both were cooked perfectly! Adding fukujin zuke is a must!"}
{"text":"Good curry that reminded me of Japan! I wish the portions were a little larger but I'll have to hit it up a few more times to see if it varies. The taste makes up for it and the portion size may just bother me cuz I grew up in America (the land of the ridiculous portion sizes)"}
{"text":"My favorite curry place! Atmosphere is great here accompany by excellent service. This time around I order lots of different things in my curry. Had their potato patty w/ rice & curry sauce spicy level 7. And added corn, spinach, Mac salad and of course a fried egg. It was delicious. We also had their famous kaba cakes for their dessert, can't remember the exact name of them but they were good. Definitely a must try :)"}
{"text":"Love this curry! I usually just go with the base and some sort of fried chicken and i'm never disappointed. The chicken katsu was perfectly done every time and the chicken kara age was always a hit with me."}
{"text":"This place looks really cool. Too bad the curry was not that good 'Watery\"....if you want to eat real Japanese curry just go across the street to Zen curry."}
{"text":"first time trying this place and i really enjoyed it. looking forward to coming back and trying different items."}
{"text":"First time coming to kaba and I had great time. Our server was really cool and made us feel welcomed. The decor was also really neat not like your typical curry place but I liked it! Especially cause you can play tic tac toe while you wait.  Great place would come back"}
{"text":"Just ate here and had the loco moco. The food was great and the service was excellent. Really friendly. I'm used to a lot of Thai curry so I wasn't sure what to expect but I thought it was great.   The prices are also really reasonable so check it out!"}
{"text":"It's always a pleasure to come and eat here. Always good vibe tunes and good vibe people here all the time.   I love the customizing of the menu on my meal! Love the help you did by explaining what everything was.   Thanks Anthony!"}
{"text":"Don't believe the other reviews until you try it yourself! Kaba Curry is the first Japanese curry I've had. I thought it was amazing and I'm Thai.   Other people have told me that Zen was way better so I went to try that place out with my friend expecting for the best. Wrong!!! Zen lacked the flavor in their curry that I loved from Kaba Curry.  I brought my same friend over to Kaba to try the curry there and my friend agreed that Kaba's curry had much more flavor! Spice levels are also great.   Love this place :)"}
{"text":"Warning: Bay Area folks, better than Curry House in Cupertino.  Their loco moco had a Japanese curry twist to eat. It was amazing!   Love grilled cheese sandwich? Their's have Japanese curry in it! Double the amazing!  We would've ordered more, but we arrived late, the fryer was being cleaned. And due to some menu changes, some items were blacked out.  They were extra friendly either way, and the waitress was personable. Carried conversation like we were friends and managed to co-erce the manager for the Wi-fi password for us. LOL  Please bring Kaba Curry to California, preferably Bay Area! I would recommend to friends who don't mind leaving the strip to get real food that's not over priced and delicious!"}
{"text":"Kaba Curry is a small, \"hole in the wall\" type restaurant close to the strip.  Their food is primarily a mix of Hawaiian and Japanese ingredients - their curry being out of this world amazing, which is obviously where the title of the establishment comes in and what they are best known for.  They have just recently moved to their location as of current and unfortunately with where it is, you do sort of have to look for it, as it doesn't stick out.  They are in the process still of actually getting set up, so there are no markers or signs that stand out  upon entering the Plaza (the name which escapes me) in China Town.    I can be picky when it comes to food. I'm sure everyone can, especially certain Yelpers!  Let me tell you though, their place is exceptionally clean and the way Antony (the owner of Kaba) and Maki (the co-owner) create and prepare the food, it is divine.  They are both very sweet, friendly and down-to-earth.  They are more than willing to cater to your food-needs and make sure you are completely satisfied before you go.  This may be a \"hole in the wall\" dining experience, but they will definitely make you feel comfortable and at home - you'll become a regular, fast!  Their menu, to be flat out, is a little small.  What I do appreciate though is the simplicity of it.  Essentially, you make your own meal in a 'build your own plate' sort of fashion.  You have the base, your curry spice level, side dishes meant to go on the curry as well as your base choice and amount of \"fun\" as they put it.  The fun, meaning things such as kimchee, corn, cooked eggs and even Fukujinzuke which is pickled ginger.  Their portions are nice, not too much, not too little - it's how I really wish most food was prepared.  I hate having so much on my plate all of the time because I'm sorry, I have a medium sized stomach, not the stomach of a Sumo Wrestler!  Maki prepares the dishes so delicately, I'd trust my food in her care any day.    Overall, this place needs more publicity and more praise.  Their restaurant is beautiful and it stands out over most other places in the area.  Way to go, Antony and Maki!  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Tried this place with Curry House in mind.  Nothing like it.  They have their own taste, a little sweeter & more \"molassy\" if that is even a word, but decent enough.  I was intrigued by a few items on their menu.  Disappointed that they don't offer deep fried oysters.  We had the Loco Moco and Fried Rice with chicken cutlet.  The Loco Moco was surprisingly small, in a small bowl, but held enough curry sauce.  The Fried Rice on the other hand barely had any sauce on it.  Had to ask for extra sauce ($1.50).  But I have to give them points for the tasty fried rice.  Also disappointed that you have to order Fukujinsuke ($.50), instead of having it on the table like most other curry restaurants I've been to.  Planning on trying Zen's curry very soon.  We'll see how they compare.  Update:  Just tried Zen's curry and it blows this place out of the water.  It was the quality of the curry sauce. Hands down. No argument there.  Each table comes with condiments for you to personalize your curry.  No extra 50 cents for a sprinkle of Fukujinsuke.  And they serve deep fried oysters.  Overall, Kaba has some work to do on quality.  For example, how special is a curry loco moco or grilled cheese sandwich if the curry itself is just mediocre?  Specially if I have, and can, make most of your menu at home?"}
{"text":"I think I feel in love with Japanese curry all over again.  The flavour of this curry is the bomb.  It's too bad that the portion size is quite small.  With the basic curry dish for $4.99 you get 4 little ice cream scoops of rice with just barely enough curry sauce on the plate.  Then for an additional $1 or $2 you can pick your meat and side dish you want to go with the curry.  I ordered the chicken katsu with a side of mushroom (courtesy of Yelp check in).  My friend had the fried spam and beer marinated beef with his curry dish.  The side items, such as corn for 50 cents each is not worth it, you get maybe only 2 tbsp full.  Although this place is not in the best of locations, I will come back and try their fried rice curry next time.  I hope that they will maybe increase their portion size next time."}
{"text":"I used to love Kaba Curry when they were on Charleston.  The curry sauce was so tasty that I craved for it every so often.  But since they have moved to this new location, it's definitely not the same.  I don't know if I came on an off day but the curry was not good this time around.  It was too thick and concentrated in taste.  Maybe this curry sauce had been reboiled and remixed for a few days.  I can't put my finger on it, but it just didn't seem right.  I ordered the tonkatsu, karaage and kurobuta soseji (Berkshire pork sausage) for my toppings with extra rice.  The tonkatsu and karaage were quite tender and juicy but I could not even tell that I had any extra rice on my plate.  My wife did not order extra rice and her plate looked the same as mine.  She had garlic chicken and chicken katsu as her toppings.  The chicken was cooked perfectly and was quite moist and delicious.  But because the curry sauce was not very good, it took away from how well made the meats were.  So 3 stars only this time. I think I would give this place one more try, because I used to love their curry sauce.  So I'm hoping next time will be better."}
{"text":"Let's start with I have no idea what good Japanese curry is. Wouldn't know it if it slapped me in the face. But I do know what tastes good and this did.  I came here with Tien and we ordered: roti, a salad, shrimp curry with mashed potato croquette and pork katsu (?). They forgot the roti (booooo! I LOVE roti!!) so I'm not sure how that is. The salad was just eh. I've had better. The shrimp, mashed potato croquette and curry rice were tasty.  Service was good, no complaints here! Prices are pretty decent too. Will absolutely go back. I did like the rice/curry very much."}
{"text":"I know nothing about Japanese curry. I'll admit that right off the bat. This was my first time eating the stuff and I thought is was delicious. The curry base ($4.99) is a mound of rice surrounded by a somewhat thick, dark curry sauce full of flavor with a bit of smokiness and subtle spiciness -- great for people like me who don't want a ton of heat. The chicken katsu ($2) was tender and succulent but the breading, while crunchy and well seasoned, was too thick. The potato croquette suffered from the same thick exterior, which covered a velvety smooth potato mix.  Prices were decent and the amount of food was plenty for me. Don't expect fast food, though. It took a while to get the food even though there was only one other person there. But it was so tasty that it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Upon Tien N's recommendation, I got the Kaba curry base with beer marinated beef.  Anthony, the partner of Kaba curry was kind enough to give me a sample portion of the pickled radish and onion to try.    Our group shared this dish  (we were sharing because we each got food from different vendor so we can eat it family style....well, more like we wanted to try everything and this is the best route), and we all enjoyed it very much.  My brother from another mother (and father), Clif C tried it for the first time, and he loved it.    We also got a surprise dessert from Anthony, the jello cheesecake.  Earl loved it.  I cannot wait until we visit Kaba Curry again, and enjoy other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Tried Kaba Curry on two separate occasions- at the Las Vegas Foodie Fest and most recently at YSB'S Night of the Living Neon...They were the best bite of the evening, IMO  Number of times at each food truck/vendor?....One  Number of times at Kaba Curry?..Ummm One...Two...Three....Four!  Totally hooked on that flavor they are able to duplicate after countless efforts. Now I'd also like to try other establishments that serve up Japanese Style Curry (Kyara, Sora, Cafe De Japon) and see how they stack up with Kaba.  It was cool chatting with one of the guys and finding out that they first started out as a hip hop clothing line(Hippoe Esthetics) and they just happened to go the food route as well-GREAT MOVE! Now people can enjoy their tasty curry and sport their cool threads as well....Win-Win situation! Best of luck with your endeavors and cannot wait to grub on some Kaba action again....ALOHA!!!  YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(247/365) \"No Worry Kaba Curry!!!\""}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Japanese style curry house since leaving Japan. My tummy was excited to try Kaba Curry for the first time. I was anticipating a rich, thick and silken curry loaded with vegetables and beef like I had in Japan or even a delicious version of the curry my Japanese mom and I make at home using S&B House Golden and Vermont Curry roux bars. The owner is Japanese so I had high expectations.   Sadly, my expectations were way to high. I really wanted to like it and support this establishment.  The portions were skimpy. The three kiddy scoops of rice in a shallow pool of gravy with a poor version of chicken karaage  wasn't what I was hoping for. The gravy had an odd \"tonkastu sauce\" taste and the consistency of pureed vegetables in the gravy made it like runny baby food.  I ordered the basic curry with chicken karaage and fukujinzuke  for $7.49, $.61 tax and $1.00 tip my bill was $9.10. Not a vallue at all. If the food is excellent, I don't mind paying more even if the portion is small.  However, I won't return if the quality, taste, value and portion size is poor.  Not only did the food fall short.  I used a debit card and they ran it through a card reader attached to an IPAD.  That was fine.  I thought however, it was rather forward to ask for customers to click on the following buttons to leave a tip. $1.00, $2.00, $3.00 or \"No Thanks\". Why ask a customer to leave a tip before they have eaten your food?  This was my first visit.  I felt I was put on the spot to tip.  I was hopeful I was going to have an excellent experience so a added a $1, but that was with reservation because I really wasn't sure if it was deserving if I hadn't eaten yet.  A tip, in my opinion, is for a job well done.  I am rather annoyed with how businesses have abused tipping. Tipping has become an expectation  and not something that the person wanting the tip should be striving to obtain. Take the humble and tasteful approach- have a tip jar on the counter.   There is no competition in this town for Japanese curry rice.  I was hoping it was going to pack a punch and have me craving for more. It's a shame because the owner and worker were friendly.  I wish them all the best!"}
{"text":"OMG soooo delicious!!!! Seriously yummy!!! If you LOVE Cocos check this place out!!! Prices are awesome, staff is friendly and the food is sooo delicious!!! We just moved here and this is on our Fav. List!!!"}
{"text":"HATE  Nothing.  DISLIKE  Female server lacked personality, didn't check on me except to bring me my food or water, and gave me my bill without even suggesting dessert. Cook forgot to make an item I ordered, and she didn't even notice!  LIKE  The curry. The loco moco. The different sides and toppings. The desserts.  LOVE  Nothing."}
{"text":"I admit. I am not a curry fan at all, but Kaba Curry totally blew me away. I won't spoil it for you all, but I'm glad that I'm one of the privileged customers to know what their secret was! I love their Japanese curry! The thickness is perfect and the flavor is slightly sweet and delicate. Most curry favors I've tasted have that really strong spice and herbal mint taste too it which I can't have too much of and most that I have tasted is more brothy. This curry had a good amount of curry for you to enjoy the flavor without feeling like the spice was taking over your taste buds.   Thankfully they were at the Night of the Living Neon event and was super thankful to have finally tried this craze that everyone keeps talking about! The staff was very friendly! They guided me through some suggestive choices. The staff explained that each element or ingredient incorporated into the curry can make a HUGE difference on the taste and experience in your mouth. So, all the more reason to go back for more! I tried the beef curry with corn, then the beef curry with cheese, and then with both. I personally liked the corn. It was a really good element to the curry and the beef. It does combine well with the curry.   Their service was on point and have to admit that their cheery and enthusiastic personality and service does reflect the quality of their food as much as their hipster graphic mascot and company colors!  If you ask me, what more can you do than to support a bunch of people who dreamed up an amazing concept and food and doing what they can to get this out there! Why hide something truly amazing? It doesn't matter HOW they serve it, WHERE they serve it, or WHAT stand point they are in as far as an establishment. What counts is a person or a group of people coming together as sharing something amazing to the public and letting them experience something good too! THAT'S WHAT A LOCAL BUSINESS IS ABOUT.   Service is great. Staff is amazing and hip. Most of all, the food is good enough for seconds! Can't wait to see you guys grow into something bigger! High fives all around!"}
{"text":"My sister told me about this place so we gave it a try. I was craving veggie curry and tofu but it wasn't on the menu. I asked our waitress and she was very friendly and asked if it could be made. They were able to so I got non spicy curry with tofu, rice, and veggies. It was fresh, hot, and tasty! The curry had tons of flavor with a light kick to it. The tofu could have been crispier but it was fine. I was happy with my dish. My b/f got the corn beef patty with rice and he really liked it. If you love curry, give this place a try! It was kind of nice to get some Asian comfort food while on vacation."}
{"text":"I liked Kaba Curry before they moved to the new location. Now the curry is not as good and they've been slow with their service too. I had high hopes for this place but have been disappointed too many times already.   And for some reason, they are always out of whatever dessert I want to order... so I've never even tried any of their desserts."}
{"text":"Japanese curry thats alright. Service is alright. Food is alright. Environment is alright. This place is just alright, alright?  The curry is, again, alright. The portions seemed small though, at a somewhat expensive price. It wasnt really filling for me and curry usually fills me up well.  Service is nice and the workers are naturally welcoming there.  Environment is neat with dim lighting and the kitchen being out there. Seating is pretty limited, but the place seems slow enough to the point where over crowding shouldnt be a problem.  Im not going to ignore the fact that Curry Zen is nearby. They both have good curry, but Zen seems like it has bigger portions at a better price. Its probably rude to mention competition on Yelp, but theres no ignoring it.  Pros: its japanese curry, service is good, and the people are welcoming  Cons: portions dont seems much for its price  Advice: I feel like itll be too rude to say it, so I wont. You can probably get an idea in my last paragraph though."}
{"text":"My Recommendation: Katsu Chicken Curry+Cheese and Green Tea Kaba Cakes.  One of Las Vegas' hidden gems that is quickly on the rise to total world domination!..Ok, maybe not \"the world\", but it is definitely taking Las Vegas by storm by being the first Japanese Curry House in town. With their own combination of spices that create the absolute most delectable dish of curry you have ever tasted, paired with rice cooked just right, a serving of Katsu chicken guaranteed to be the perfect blend of crunch and juicy tenderness and finished off with a pair of \"just-out-of-the-oven\" Green Tea Kaba cakes topped with a delicious green tea icing, you'll be left asking yourself \"Where has this been all of my life?!\" In a city overrun with burger places and coffee shops on every corner, Kaba Curry brings something new to the table, and in this case, change is a good thing...a very, very good thing."}
{"text":"3 stars because there food is so good. Tired of going there and they are closed during business hours (twice this week). Took my lunch at work and wanted to get a to go order, drive there and they were closed. Wasted my lunch and had to settle for drive through. Unprofessional and frustrating."}
{"text":"I have loved this place since 2012 when they were doing a kick starter, Been there almost every week since they got this new location and with their new and improved menu along with the app I have to say they just keep getting better and better. The curry is the best I've had in town and now even their none curry items are worth going for like the garlic chicken and the tasty new fries.  I always suggest this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"Freaking delicious! Not too spicy,good portions, so good that we went for seconds and bypassed all the other food trucks. I know what I like, and I like Kaba Curry. Go get some!"}
{"text":"You know those places where you can go to just kick it and hang with your goofy friends and chat with the staff? This is one if those places. You can come as you are, the nerdier the better! Let your inner otaku out while you eat some amazing dishes. The decor is simple and bright, very inviting and you're always welcomed with a smile. The food is cooked to order so it comes out piping hot. You can choose from different bases and then add as many toppings as you like. Get crazy with it! We won't judge you. Oh, and you can choose your spice level so you can sweat out all those toxins or stay calm and collected while you devour the deliciousness.  And just a side note, this is Japanese curry, not the overwhelmingly fragrant Indian curry. So if you were worried about any type of strong smell don't worry. You can still kiss that hot crush of yours with no issues!"}
{"text":"I tried these guys out at streets a couple of months ago. I'm a big curry fan. I like to eat curry from all countries- india, thailand, malaysia, and of course, Japan. One of my staple meals at home is kare raisu- made with golden curry sauce mix of course!  Well kaba beats the pants off the instant kare raisu I make at home. Like, seriously. The sauce is a great consistency- not too thick, not too thin. Rice- perfect cooked. And the chicken katsu- YUM YUM. Seriously, I can't think of a better combination of flavors: plain white rice, the complex curry sauce, and the yummy crunch of fried chicken. My friend who was with me at streats took a bite of my curry, and while she normally only enjoys simple typically american foods, she was pleasantly surprised by Kaba and said \"wow! That's really good!\"  If you ever see these guys at any food truck event, do yourself a favor and try them. they are so delicious."}
{"text":"I have needed to do this review for a while now.  I enjoy their dark, mildly sweet & tangy curry and has a very addicting flavor, to me. I have had it base (with 4 scoops of rice) & on fried rice (spam?).  I have had it with chicken katsu & chicken karaage.  Lastly I top with mushrooms (that's a free item with a yelp check-in).  Here is how it is done: 1) Pick your base (base, cheese fries, fried rice, udon) 2) Pick your sides (meats, veggies, proteins) 3) Pick your toppings (like mushrooms, cooked egg, kimchee  Also, don't forget, they have a frequent diner's card that, after 5 orders, your 6th is free.  And jeez, for the sake of all that is holy, don't touch the menu monitor!  It is not a touch screen."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch, looking forward to trying the curry udon. Unfortunately, I never got the chance to. The food court was relatively empty when I arrived, and no one was visible at the window Kaba curry. I thought I heard voices coming from inside, so I waited for a few minutes thinking someone would come out.   No one ever did. Needless to say, terrible customer service."}
{"text":"LOCATED INSIDE THE WHITE BUILDING WITH THE INTERNET CAFE SIGN ON THE OUTSIDE.    Now, what you come here for is the curry.  And the curry is damn good.  Favorite of mine is the chicken katsu curry.  The other protein sides you can add is beef, tofu, pork, and Japanese sausage.    I was able to taste two different styles of their lumpia and I prefer the second version.  As far as dessert goes, I was only able to taste the kabacakes which was DELICIOUS!  This is another locals spot worth trying, do support local businesses!"}
{"text":"I see my Yelp buds checking into this place from time to time. But I gots to say...I wasn't too impressed.  So, here we go...  The gf and I came here to meet a few Yelp peeps and to drop off some donations at Yosi.  When we arrived, our Yelp buds were already here and the place wasn't busy.  One thing I immediately noticed, no one had food on their tables. I assumed that they all ordered and were just waiting for their food. About 10 minutes later, one of the employees arrive at their table to finally take their order. Say What?  You know what that meant.  That meant that it's going to take about 15 minutes or so for just our orders to be taken.  Yes, I was right, but it was more like 20 minutes.  Ordering their food is simple, you start at the top with your base, then add to it with whatever they have to offer (i.e. beef, shrimp, egg rolls, shrimp, chicken, etc), and then add toppings of your choice.  I got their Loco Kaba Moco with Chicken Karaage and Chicken Katsu.  I also used my free check in to have mushrooms added.  I thought that food was just okay, nothing spectacular.  I have to admit, I'm not a curry fan.  But Kaba's curry is pretty good.  The karaage and katsu was average.  Remember I had mushrooms added?  Well, they didn't. They forgot the mushrooms, but at this point I didn't care since it was part of my free Yelp check in.   But back to the service, when our food arrived, they forgot to give me utensils.  And you know me, I need a fork for everything.  I eventually got my fork so I can chow down.  My gurlpren's food took a little longer and when it finally arrived, they decided to be consistent with their service and fail to get her utensils too.   So, overall my experience here was just okay. I didn't have too many issues with my food because I knew what to expect based on the price and what I was eating. I was just a little disappointed with the overall service. Will I be back? Perhaps, maybe, or maybe not.     PS:  I turn into the Hulk when I'm starving. I go from hangry to angry. And you wouldn't want to see me when I'm angry.    YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (491/500)"}
{"text":"Came in last night because my handy Yelp App told me this was the best place to go near my facial place. Yelp app do me no wrong. :)  This place is in a building with other small food shop vendors. After I parked I realized how close it was to CSN and it reminded me of a cafeteria. It's ok though, I like the quick and fast food service as it fulfilled my purpose.   I ordered the Curry Udon with Karaage. The chicken was juicy and not overly battered. I like Karaage more than Katsu usually and it met my expectations. I really liked the soupy curry with the Udon because I believe you can taste the curry more(instead of over rice).   Mind you I've never been to Japan for the \"authentic\" curry but thought this was pretty legit. The curry had some texture to it and it looked like small bits and pieces of carrot and onion. So sort of like a soupy, vegetable stewy, curry. Yum, my new go to spot after my facial."}
{"text":"Lol I got like five pieces of meat blocks and a ton of rice and curry.   Could be better."}
{"text":"Kaba Curry was at the Las Vegas Foodie Fest today and even though it was a hot day I knew I couldn't pass up the chance to them out....  It was $5.50 for a medium bowl filled with rice,curry, cheese, corn, one chicken breast strip katsu (Thanks Kaba Curry for using white meat!!) and one piece of Potato croquette-  Well, let me clarify the price- $5.50 is for the basic Chicken Katsu, curry sauce and rice- cheese and corn were .50 cents each to add and $1.00 for the potato croquette. So, with all the little add on's it can get pretty pricey..... The amount of food could be more in my opinion.... There are other add in's like spinach,pickled baby onions, extra rice ect..  I was surprised and disappointed to see that we were only given one piece of a chicken strip - in the picture I thought there was at least 2 pieces....  And $1.00 for a small piece of potato croquette isn't cool either....  -Most potato croquettes are good sized patties-   Now onto the taste- Yummy!!! I did enjoy the taste of the curry very much - right amount of spice and I love the little pieces of carrots in there - I love carrots - there should be more carrots!!!!  Kaba Curry if you are going to continue using those little bowls them make sure they are filled up so that everyone gets there fill and doesn't leave still hungry cause don't we all hate that???  So all in all we did think that Kaba Curry tastes yummy and even though it's hott ass summertime time coming up in Vegas - if you see Kaba Curry out there give them a try cause the curry is yummers...."}
{"text":"Chicken Katsu is the best! Friendly people and a good place to hang out. This is where I go to satisfy my curry craving hehe"}
{"text":"Curry spots have been sprouting throughout Las Vegas just like when ramen was beginning to blow up and Zen was my go to spot.  I heard of this place and would see it as I drove past it from time to time and one late night I thought i would give this place a chance.  Walking to the place it was fairly clean and open.  They have a tv which plays the same series of random anime and tuesday blend clips over and over.  The music they were playing gave me the impression that I was walking into some underground fight club which didn't bother me, just gave me a weird vibe.  They have japanese magazines with some business cards on a table in the middle of the restaurant which was cool.  I really enjoyed going through all the pictures in the magazine despite not being able to read it.   Food: I ordered the loco moco curry dish.  The dish itself was good HOWEVER, the curry was cold.  What I don't understand is how you can advertise yourself as a curry restaurant and to not even keep the curry at a good temperature really disappointed me.  Besides the temperature of the food, the spice level (3-4) was spot on.   Service: Was great, everyone was really nice and I didn't have an issue with anyone.   Overall, curry needs to be hot bottom line... The cold curry really ruined the whole meal.  Would i come back? not sure since Zen is close by and their curry is always spot on."}
{"text":"We were going to another place in the shopping center but decided to stop and try Kaba Curry. The waitress was very helpful and told us what wasn't available on the menu that day. She also explained why there was an extra charge to have the curry spiced hot), in that their curry regularly comes without spice. I had the curry with white rice, I added level 3 hotness (hotness levels of 1-5)with Fried Spam and Kimchee on the side. It was very good, and the portion size was \"just right\". A very good experience and I will be back."}
{"text":"just tried this place, hella bomb curry.  was satisfied with their service & staff & food! will be back again for sure and enjoyed meeting & talking to tnes, nice to meet other people from home/hawaii."}
{"text":"This is not your typical curry spot. People normally think India when they think of curry. This is Japanese. A different blend of spices and curry flavors make this place awesome.   They even got a DJ booth: how cool is that?   The owner (Anthony) is laid back and down to earth. Really cool peeps!!   Check this spot out when you are in Chinatown (Las Vegas)."}
{"text":"I really like their katsu! I think katsu from other places are a bit bland, but kaba's was flavorful and crispy. I know there's quite a boom in Japanese cuisine in the valley, which makes me real happy. I can start to re-live my childhood with all these different venues. With the curry base + chicken katsu + fukujinzuke = $8 something cents was not bad at all. Now let's talk about their curry. I found it to be quite good, the texture wasn't runny and it was a little spicy (not sweet). From the past reviews I'm guessing they've altered their recipe a bit to cater to the diners spice preference.   The location wasn't hard for me to find, since I used to frequent the \"food court\" back when I used to attend CSN. When ordering, the guy used his iPad (which I thought was cool) as the register. I even got my receipt via text message haha. They take your order and ask for your name, then you wait for your order. They also deliver it to you if you're not waiting by the window, which was a bonus :) I think Kaba Curry is a great addition to the food court for students of CSN (and others) to go get their grub on."}
{"text":"3-stars, curry pretty good, just missing food! Wow 7 bucks for loco moco! Was expecting big plate for that price, so built up my appetite only to find out was in manini bowl, with manini portions and no mac salad with dat. To top it off they ran out of mac, curry with no mac is KAPU in my book.If you're on a diet, need an expensive pupu, or jus like tickle your tummy this is an ok spot."}
{"text":"We had the food at Foody Festival and it is the best curry and rice that I have had anywhere. I read on the Kaba Curry blog website that the spent six months developing the curry and rice and it really shows! The curry and rice is so delicious!"}
{"text":"I heard this from a friend so I decided to stop by! The ambient of the place is really nice and the music in the background is good, so I'll give them props to that. Now for the curry....I ordered the Kurokke and it was creamy and very hot! I burnt my tongue but I still had a good time eating it. Another topping was an egg. It was my mistake not asking for not a fully cooked egg, so I couldn't enjoy it as much. I also ordered ginger and onion as sides but you had to pay for them....at zen curry they're free. The curry was also watery, instead of thick and rich The taste of it is good though. All in all, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Ordered: Curry with Chicken Karrage and Fried Tofu $7.99 + tax.  Perhaps I don't like Japanese style curry? I find myself comparing everything to Curry House in Little Tokyo and every time I try another place, I still prefer Curry House. To me, Kaba's sauce is just too sweet. I prefer my curry with a little more cumin and a small kick.  Walked in at 12:30 to order and was told the beef was sold out. Really????? You were just opened a half hour ago and I don't see a throng of people ordering in front of me.  While taste is subjective (I would give taste a solid 2.0), I had to give it a 2.5 and grudgingly round it up to a 3.0 because I do not see the value ($7.99) for six small bite-sized pieces of chicken and 4 small pieces of tofu that still left me hungry. I don't know what they pay in rent, but it appears to be a lower-rent type place and they could have given a little more food for the money. Secondly, please be prepared to have your full menu available. I really hate hearing \"SOLD OUT\" when we both know you are lying to me. It was SOLD OUT as of closing yesterday and you didn't prepare any for today."}
{"text":"First impression of Kaba Curry was not good. Our little family walked in an hour and a half before closing and all we saw was a HUGE group of guys waiting for their meal. And when I say huge, I mean they took up like half the restaurant. I knew we were going to have somewhat of a wait because there were no plates in front of them. There wasn't a sign that said to seat yourself, so we waited by the counter. There was a man behind the counter talking to another man (one of the patrons) and I'd say it took a good FIVE minutes for him to even acknowledge us..... and we were standing right in front of him. My boyfriend gave me the \"let's just walk out\" look but this place has been blasting my IG newsfeed so I wanted to see the hype.   When we were finally able to order, there was a list of stuff they had ran out of, so we had to rethink our decisions. (ugh) We waited a good 20-25 minutes for our food but it was nice and piping hot. The curry was OK. I think we prefer Indian curry so it may just be a preference thing. My BF ate the food, but I don't think he'll want to eat it again. The concept is great and they offer very creative toppings and sides to go along with the curry, but like I said, it may just be a preference thing. I would give the food a 3/4 but have to downgrade to a 2 because of the initial service. Perhaps I'll visit again and update after....."}
{"text":"Located in a small, but warmly-staffed food court near the CSN Campus, Kaba Curry takes convenience, charm, and really great cooking, and wraps it all up neatly in an affordable, fun, and genuine eating experience. CSN students are very lucky to have this near campus...  There are tons of provided curry options, a few non-curry options, with lots space to customize as well; it's always great when you can count on a menu and add-ons to satisfy almost any taste and profile. You can do a very traditional curry with just sauce and potato, but you can go all the way up to having spam and/or shrimp gyoza on your curry. The serving sizes are generous for the price, and can be shared if you and your partner are not particularly hungry, but not excessive. The dishes are cohesive, mildly sweet, and satisfying, like Japanese-style curry sauces and dishes should be. The green tea desserts are made with great matcha. Bullet-proof deliciousness there. Definitely trying the chantilly dessert next time.  I love the attention to detail the staff has as well, providing extra spoons when they know you'll be sharing, and remembering people from past visits. That extra touch goes a long way - as a result, it seems that Kaba Curry has quite the loyal following, and for good reason! Looking forward to returning here again, and seeing them keeping it up like this. It's not a complicated joint, but it doesn't pretend to be, either, and Kaba Curry is fantastic at what they do and should do."}
{"text":"It was our first time coming here and what a HORRIBLE experience it was!We read positive yelp reviews so we thought we would give this place a try. BAD MISTAKE.   Walked in with my girlfriend hoping to enjoy a nice meal here, but when we passed through the door, no one helped us. The workers were \"busy\" talking to their friends. There were (what appears to be) around 10 college students including one of the workers playing a \"trading card game.\" Seriously? They looked too old to be playing Pokemon cards. We ended up going to \"Japanese Curry Zen\" right across the street instead.   Terrible service!!"}
{"text":"Went here because of the good reviews. I am a Japanese curry fanatic. I grew up on Japanese curry. So when I tried this place, it was a huge disappointment. Curry was more watery. Service was horrible. It took awhile for our food to come out. We had to ask for the check ahead of time knowing they were going to take another 15 minutes to actually bring us something. Keeping in mind the restaurant wasn't busy at all. It was my table and another group and that's it. Will not return again  If you want to try curry, Japanese Zen curry is my preferred to go spot."}
{"text":"This Curry place is amazing...I am so in love with this place! I used to go to the other place but after I tasted Curry here.. I am going to say  this place curry is better than any other places!!! Just can't explain what is exactly different but I love it! I was not that big fan of curry person until I found out this place lol Thinking about going back there again soon.. Love the yellow color interior and energy! One of Co-Owner Anthony is so nice and friendly too. He mentioned they can have DJ for the big group, I am so excited to going back there again with my group. I'm so glad I found this place!!!"}
{"text":"I came late that night. The service was great, fast, and the flavors of the curry was great. I would like to go back to try something else!"}
{"text":"I'm actually kind of bummed I tried this because there is nothing quite like it in Seattle and I know I'm going to be craving it all the time! The flavor is spot on! Cute & friendly staff didn't hurt either! When in Vegas, Kaba Curry is a winner!  Pros Bomb Japanese Curry!   Cons Las Vegas"}
{"text":"I am totally hooked. Flavor is perfect and not overpowering like other curry meals I've had. Speaking of it now...I'm heading there now and I think you should too!!!"}
{"text":"I've always seen this place on my daily trips to Chinatown but I've never actually went in unil today. Craving curry, but seeing that my usual spot at Japanese Zen Curry was a 30 minute wait, I decided to try this place out with my boyfriend. It's a small, modern place that was pretty empty for a Friday night when I came in, minus about 4 people, not including the employees. The waitress let us sit wherever we want and we then proceeded to look at the menu.   I was surprised with all the options that were given, where it included curry fries, curry udon, etc, not just the usual curry and rice, and there were many toppings to choose from. I decided on getting the curry and rice with corned beef hash, spice level 2, and my boyfriend got the curry udon with shrimp gyoza, spice level 5. The wait time wasn't too bad, about 15 minutes, but the food that came out as a result was well worth the wait. To put it plainly, it was absolutely positively amazing."}
{"text":"If you're craving some really bomb curry, this is the spot to go to! There's three base dishes; Curry and rice (or fried rice), curry and cheese fries, or curry udon. I got the curry with rice. They let you choose the slickness level from 1-5. I like my food spicy so I got it at level 5 which is the hottest. I'm surprised at how spicy it actually was. I would have wanted even spicier but it was good! Then, they let you choose sides and toppings. I chose pork tonkatsu with a side of pickled radish, kimchee, and scallions. I also got a fried over medium egg on top.... Because yolk makes everything better :) I also ordered extra curry because I love extra sauce in everything I eat. Haha. It was soooooooo delicious. I really wanted corn and cheese in my curry but I didn't see it on the menu. I should have asked because I bet they would have it although it wasn't on the menu. But curry; 5/5  I also got the fried furikake chicken wings. Mmm mouthwatering. The sauce on those wings were flames. They were so good I asked the manager to give me a sample of the sauce to take home . AND she gave me a cup of it to go! I was shocked. She didn't charge me for it or anything.   So, yes I would come back here. And I recommend anyone craving some curry to go there!"}
{"text":"Had the options to pick curry spice levels and sides! What stood out was the awesome service! Staff made us feel soo comfortable! Maki and Tnes were super friendly! We'll def come back to this place!!!!"}
{"text":"This place rocks my socks off!!! My favorite is curry and rice, level 4, tonkatsu,  with cheese and cooked egg."}
{"text":"I'm no expert on Japanese curry and it would probably be one of the last things I would choose amongst the spectrum of Japanese food.  But we were in search of something quick before our movie date. Because Kaba Curry just opened their new location, we figured we give it a try. They are located in the same shopping center as the original SF Supermarket. Their exact location is the 2nd floor next to Bazic and hidden behind the staircase.  No official large signage anywhere yet.   They have a temporary menu right now which consists of putting together your own curry plate. We went for the staple of Curry & Rice ($4.99) and added one side - Spam Katsu ($1), which is 1 slice.  You can choose your spice level as well.   Our dish didn't take too long and we woofed it down. We were probably in and out within 15 minutes. There was one party of 2 there before us and a couple of singles that arrived after.  Overall, we were pleasantly surprised with the curry. It had a deep flavor and had the Husband and I rethinking Japanese curry.  Sides range from Ground Beef to Deep Fried Tofu to Tonkatsu from $1 to $3.  Toppings range from Corn to Spinach to Cooked Egg from 50 cents to 75 cents.  I guess most people choose a few sides and toppings to round out their dish.  Good to know for future reference.  Free topping with Yelp check-in! (They just started this a day or two after we went!)  Side note: When we paid with our credit card on the Ipad, we didn't see a spot to add a tip to our total. Did we miss that section?"}
{"text":"Is it just me that everytime i take a bite it makes you smile?!? the first bite i took got me confused. In back of my mind i was like ..  .\"HOW DARE YOU THREATEN MY TASTE BUDS!!!\". as you continue to eat you notice it takes you on a journey O.o! IT ACTUALLY DOES!!! Will definately go back!!!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best place to get curry. I honestly got addicted after eating my first plate. It is the best place to eat by far. This is my favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"I loves me some curry! It's honestly one of my favorite foods. And I love Kaba Curry because they have a wide variety of delicious things I can put in my curry. Their spam katsu is amazing (when they remember to give me it :P), I also enjoy their korokke! And the company is great too. I always enjoy bringing some friends and getting to visit with Anthony and Maki!"}
{"text":"I was not wowed by this place, but it is a decent place for a quick and inexpensive lunch. The curry is very good and I had the pork. I would warn any one if you are hungry don't get the Japanese sausage, my co-worker who joined me for lunch here ordered it. The sausages were so small it should be embarrassing to this place to serve them. The server was friendly and allowed my co-worker to change his meal. We also had one other issue. I am not sure what they do at night, but they have speakers and what looks like a DJ stand. When we came in the music was quite loud and had to move tables so we could hear each other. After telling the server he turned the music down, but it was still quite loud. Other than that the food was good and we may return for lunches in the future."}
{"text":"Kaba is one of those places I've been meaning to try and since they were one of the partnered businesses for We Are One supply drive for Philippines so I wanted to go support all that were helping gather up donations.   I got the udon curry with just egg and rakkyo. Overall the current was decent, but there was a little too much cumin flavor for me. I do like it with the udon and while I went really plain it stood up well alone. The BF said his loco moco was okay. Mac salad was plentiful and was well made. I was STILL hungry though after eating. I ate a full bahn mi after and got shaved snow immediately after leaving. Not good. I could have ordered more here, but the wait did not lead me to want to get dessert or extra sides.   I understand with there being large groups there would be some wait, but I just noticed how it was not really efficient. Things were coming out one by one, so I don't think they are doing line procedure in assembling and expediting. Like at our table there was 3 loco mocos and 2 curry udons. You would think all the locos come out together, the udons come out together, etc.   The first moco was halfway done and the next two arrived a few minutes apart....then my udon came and the BF asked about their side of macaroni. The BF was at a few bites left of his moco before the mac salad came. After all the loco mocos were eaten, finally Christina got her udon which was cold but the gyoza was warmer so they probably had it sitting waiting on the fried gyoza. Most people were saying that one part of their meal was hot while the other was cold. My egg was hot, noodles warm. This feels like a timing issue. A few people at my table who have been here before have said food takes a long time here, even in their previous visits.  Curry is made in large batches, the sides are made to order for it. 90minutes of a meal just seemed a bit long for our 2 tables plus a few people at the bar and one group of 3 in the restaurant.   The waitress was nice enough.   It's alright. I think I prefer curry elsewhere. I did like the udon curry noodles, but that is not a 1 hour 10 minute wait worthy food. Very few things for me is."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Their food is the closest I can get to homemade Hawaiian/Japanese comfort food without stopping by my mom's. On top of that, the employees are super nice and down to earth. It's a nice, small, and quaint restaurant that's perfect for hangouts with friends."}
{"text":"I'm a little late to the Kaba Curry game!  They have a very casual vibe here.  Clean setup, nice atmosphere, and the friendly staff goes well with the good food served here.  My fav so far has been the Curry Rice ($11): Tonkatsu, Kaarage, and Fried Egg. I asked for the \"spicy\" curry, and it packs a punch! It was only a little bit spicy in my book, but there was TONS of flavor! My favorite Japanese CURRY so far.  I would say the Tonkatsu was passable though, as well as the Kaarage.  I think the best sides so far have been the Chicken Katsu and Kurobuta Sausage personally.  Also tried the Curry Cheese Fries ($12-13): Chicken Katsu, Kurobuta Sausage, Corn and Mushrooms. This was much different but tasty! Recommended if you want to try something new in a less traditional sense.  We have also tried the Curry Udon, which is essentially udon noodles with a curry broth.  It is thin enough to drink as a soup without being overpowering.  The flavor is good, but the combination was a little different.  Give it a try if you are looking for something different.  And to finish, we got to try the Pumpkin Kaba Cakes. These were pretty awesome! They steam the cakes here, so they come out super moist, rich, and delicious!  This was the highlight of the meal, along with the flavorful curry :)  Check it out if you are craving curry!  Pics:"}
{"text":"Perfectly cooked chicken, okay veggies, great flavor on the curry - but really thin, almost watery? Definitely not what I'm used to with Japanese curry and it made it hard to eat, especially on a flat plate (it was practically curry soup), but it tasted good. For nearly ten dollars I expected a larger portion, too. So it's pretty okay. Decent food, cute location, nice staff. Could do better but it's not anything so negative that I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"You can always find the owner here in such a great mood and very helpful at all times.  It's located on the 2nd floor of the plaza towards the right hand side, near a a karaoke place. Parking at times can be hard to find, but don't be afraid to park in the garage. Plenty of room there.  Overall the place is very quiet, I usually come on weekday nights. Layout is very spacious and big, lots of yellow and brown.  Customer service here is always on point. My water is always promptly filled :)). They're very patient with ordering and explaining the whole process.   The wait for food is never too long and if it is there's always a good reason behind it. Prices are your normal curry price too. For what too order i get the curry and rice with chicken katsu, and korokke, taste sooooo goood.  Protip: Download their app it's actually useful! The owner always updates it!"}
{"text":"Kaba Curry is still on point. Everything is fresh and made from scratch the way food should be. My massive compliments and hats off to the chef. Tried  level 3 heat tonight and it was so tasty. Good kick and flavor. Had awesome service as always!!!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Wednesday afternoon during a lunch break. I ordered 1. #1 rice and curry - lvl 3, 4.99  2. with Tonkatsu, 3  3.  Fried egg, 75c 4. Kim chi, 75c  (Yelp Check-In free topping) For $12   - In the SF supermarket plaza. On the 2ndfloor.  - The food reminds me of something I stir up when I was in college. Get some Golden Curry by S&B, canned corn, fry myself an egg, steam some rice, and top it off with some Kim Chi I bought at HMart. What I can't make and would take some time is the Tonkatsu.  - The tonkatsu was good. flaky, better than L&Ls, but nothing like Yu-Yu on Chinatown.  - Portions are average. Didn't get full, but enough to be satisfied.  - I personally think, although not curry but pretty similar, is Island Style's cutlet with gravy is better, especially for the price.  - Friendly service. Pretty empty so we got in and out in about 30 minutes.  - I'd probably come back to try other foods. Although, food is very simple. Not too impressed."}
{"text":"My first attempt to try Kaba 4 months ago was an epic FAIL!  I relied on Yoda (my GPS) and thought he told me to go to the wrong place.  The parking lot was empty and there was no signage.  I was starving after getting out of class and wanted to try something else around the area.  I've never been to Campus Commons (even though school is just a few feet away) so I thought I got punked!  I don't normally crave for curry but after the Yelp event 2 nights ago, I had to have it again.  I originally planned on coming back here next week after finals but the urge to have curry STAT was far too strong.  I also had to claim my free green tea Kaba cakes.  The thing I love the most about Kaba is that you can pick a base (curry base with rice, curry fries or fried rice for like $5) then mix and match toppings (beef, chicken katsu, tonkatsu, chicken karate, pork, veggies, potato korroke, lumpia, Japanese sausage, deep fried tofu, spam katsu for $2 each) and sides (corn, cheese, spinach, mushrooms, fukujinzuke, ichimi, rakkyo for 50 cents each). Food democracy!  The ordering process is simple and efficient.  They have a list of options and just circle what you order.  You can have your receipt sent to you via text message or e-mail - save the trees!  On your 5th visit, you get a 50% discount!  So, today I ordered the curry base with chicken katsu, potato korroke, corn and mushrooms x 2 for my sister and I.   There was a 20-minute wait because they serve your food hot and fresh, and the green tea cakes take a while. It's Aloha Friday so, everybody must stay calm.  One of the peeps that runs the place gave me inside information which was a smart move to distract me and it worked!  So, tomorrow the curry udon will be on the menu.  In the next few weeks, expect: curry pizza, melon float with green tea ice cream...I should have left them my number so they could call me when the day comes. But yes, the food is great and the curry isn't overpoweringly spicy.  The green tea cakes were steamed so they were soft moist.  They look like mini doughnuts without the guilt.  They come with a small cup of  green tea frosting.  G-double O-D good!!!  I'll be done with my last exam at noon some time next week and I'll be sure to go to Kaba Curry for more...and some Ramune!"}
{"text":"I used to go to Kaba when they were still close to school on Charleston - I'm glad they moved.  The new location is more spacious and they're not sharing a common space with anyone. It's next door to Bazic. They have a DJ booth. They have more items on their menu now. What didn't change is their service. Friendly and they genuinely care about their product and their customers.  I normally get rice and chicken katsu/ pork tonkatsu with whatever toppings I feel like having that day + a melon soda/ Ramune. Last time I went, I tried the curry cheese fries with chicken katsu, kurobuta sausage, korokke (croquettes) corn and mushrooms. I got one topping for free for checking in. I can't say I've tried anything on their menu I didn't like.  We were asked if we want to be guinea pigs and try their seasonal pumpkin kaba cake (available Oct-Nov only). Since I love their kaba cake (green tea), we couldn't say no! Their kaba cakes are steamed so they're very moist and soft. The pumpkin kaba cake had only a hint of pumpkin which is good because I hate pumpkin. The frosting was great. Their desserts aren't super sweet.  So you pick a curry base, spice level, side(s) and topping(s). They also have salads, curry chili bowl, roti, chicken plate, furikake and desserts.  Curry Bases ($4.99-7.50): Curry & rice, curry & cheese fries, curry fried rice, curry udon, loco moco  Spice Levels (50 cents...for reals!): 1 to 5  Sides ($1.50-3): Beer-marinated ground beef, chicken karaage, chicken katsu, corned beef hash patty, deep-fried tofu, deep-fried shrimp, korokke, kurobuta sausage,  lumpia, shrimp gyoza, spam katsu, tonkatsu and steamed veggies  Toppings (50-75 cents): Egg, corn, cheese, kimchee, fukujinzuke, mushrooms, rakkyo, spinach, extra curry, extra rice  Desserts ($2-5.50): Chantilly kaba cakes, green tea kaba cakes, cheesecake, haupia chocolate mousse pie, melon soda & green tea ice cream float, midori mash up."}
{"text":"This review is based on portion only.  I was charged $10.27 for one piece of chicken katsu cutlet that was cut into 5 pieces and an order of curry udon, the size of a bowl that could fit in my hand.  I recommend heading to Japanese Curry Zen that's half a block away since portion is bigger and for about the same price.  Also, be careful with the closing times listed on Yelp (2:00am) that's listed. I called once to make a to go order and they already closed their kitchen at midnight."}
{"text":"If i had to make a choice of only one place to eat for the entire year, this would be it. Kaba Curry manages to mix both the flavors of Hawaiian and Japanese curry. The great thing about Kaba is that you basically build your own plate of curry. It starts out with rice and curry base and you add on things like Chicken Karaage, Sausage, Spam, Beef, etc etc.    The portion size is quite generous and the staff is quite sociable and friendly. Kaba Curry can quickly change from a quick dine in to  regular stop. I can surely say, I'm glad i have become a regular here.     My one recommendation is Loco Moco!"}
{"text":"Only reason why I go to Vegas nowadays... Kaba Curry!"}
{"text":"This was such a treat! My first time at a Yelp event, I got to meet and spend time with fellow Yelpers, have a great time and talk about what we all love... FOOD! I would have never found this place on my own, so it was great to receive the invitation for Kaba Curry and get to enjoy their Japanese curried noodles. Surrounded by other food places, such as wing king (awesome as well), this place is ideal if you want to grab some very tasty food at very reasonable prices. Let's dig a bit more into the experience.  The food was simply amazing. One of the sampled dishes was curried udon noodles and the taste of the sauce itself had a complex taste but was easily enjoyable. The first thing you will notice when you try their curry is the explosion of flavors in your mouth, and then you start to feel the subtle heat of the spices...a great flavor combination you will love."}
{"text":"I am one to shy away from Japanese curry. For the longest time, I would be quick to say that I like almost every other cultures version of curry until I went to another local restaurant in Vegas. I liked Kaba Curry. Which has me teetering between a three and four star review.   The staff is really friendly and have greeted me with a smile both times I have been there. They excuse themselves when busy and always make sure that the guest knows that they are not being ignored.  The food is good. I had the Kaba Moco and thought it was solid in flavor. The complaint comes in the fact that I always feel the need for more pickled radish and scallions. I wish they would just put some on the table. Besides that small inconvenience, I didn't care for the wait time on certain items. My friends ordered curry udon and it took some time before they got their items. Other people had their meals already and were trying to wait. One of the udons was lukewarm at best. By that time, most of our meals were in an attempt to wait. I understand that the kitchen is small. I would go back. I like their flavor. they just need to figure out how to navigate their issues."}
{"text":"The Internet Cafe on Charleston across from the CSN Charleston campus where I work has always been an enigma of sorts to me.  In 6 years of working here I literally had never heard of anyone mention eating there even though it's within walking distance.  I knew it had a somewhat revolving door of restaurants that inhabited it and yet I never heard a word about any of them being any good, nonetheless what they even served.  Until Kaba Curry arrived, that is.  I'd heard or read rumblings of Kaba Curry through some of the food truck appearances they'd made, though being someone who prefers to eat sitting down and in climate controlled conditions, I figured I'd never get to try them.  Once I heard they would be overtaking one of the Internet Cafe storefronts, I knew that I would be killing two birds with one visit.    Upon entering the Internet Cafe from the south side entrance, Kaba Curry was immediately the first stall on the left side.  There are really only a few options as far as curry goes, you either go with Beef or Chicken Katsu curry, and then there are a series of add ons for about 50 cents a piece that include cheese, corn, spinach, additional rice, potato korroke, and some onion looking thing I'd never seen before.  I went with the beef curry with added corn and spinach.  It was presented in a styrofoam container without a bag at first and I had to ask for a bag as I intended to take it to go.  Simple mistake and I never specified I wanted it to go either so no biggie.  The cashier placed my order in a bag and I was on my way.  Word of warning:  I'm not sure if the container they placed my food in is the typical \"to go\" packaging, but as I was driving or carrying it back to my office, curry started spilling out of the container into the bag and it ended up being quite messy to pull the meal out to eat.    Digging in, I really enjoyed the flavor of the curry.  It had a nice thickness and had a nice level of spice.   It actually reminded me quite fondly of the packaged Japanese Golden Curry you can get in stores that my mom makes (shoutout to mom).  It came with several scoops of sticky rice which tasted delicious smothered in the thick curry.  I thought both the corn and spinach were worth the extra $.50 each, and next time I will try the korroke and maybe the onion add ons.  The beef tasted pretty average, but combined with all the other flavors on the plate it was a very good, reasonably priced meal overall.   They actually had some side dishes available that I didnt see listed anywhere on their website or mentioned in any reviews here.   Thinking on it now I realize I should have snapped a pic.  I didn't pay too much attention to those offerings as I was set on trying curry.     In the future I'd like to see even more topping options as well some upgraded drink offerings, as they only had Coke, 7up and Arrowhead bottled water available.  At this point I'm happy to have a new spot in my lunch rotation that's so close to the office.  Apologies to my co-workers or any future dates for the ensuing curry smell seeping form my pores."}
{"text":"Concept is dope as fuck however the curry was not my type.  It seems like if you are a fan of Thai Curry you will probably be a fan of this place.   I ordered the Curry Rice + Chicken Katsu + Chicken Karaage. Growing up on Japanese Curry I like it thick and spicy (shout out to those ladies). Kaba's curry is a little bit watered down as if they use apple sauce to mild the curry (I hate when my mom did this). Shit I just realized I never let the girl know how hot I wanted it...maybe this was why the flavor was a little bit tangy which was different than what I am used to.   The Chicken Katsu was on point, the Chicken Karaage was as well. Probably the best Chicken Karaage in town in my opinion. If you don't know what it is it's basically a lighter fried chicken with flavor to it. The staple dish that I grew up on...If this place sold Chicken Karaage and the varieties that you can make Karaage this place would have got damn near 5 stars but we talking bout curry.  Like I mentioned the concept is cool, caters towards my generation and younger and has many items to add-on with. However in my PERSONAL OPINION the curry was a miss. I do want to try it on a spicier level so I would probably try it again.   Has a lot of potential! If you haven't tried it just do it!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to come here because I was craving curry, and read the reviews so I wanted to see if it lived up to the hype. Unfortunately, my first time here left something to be desired.   I came here with a few friends. When we walked in there were a few people seated at the bar, and two other tables, but it didn't seem busy. We weren't sure if we seated ourselves or not, and w weren't greeted so we just sat at an open table.   It took a little while before we were even acknowledged, but the server was apologetic and got us started with drinks. Unfortunately, when we ordered the server came back and told us they were sold out and that we had to reorder. After changing my order, I ended up getting the standard Katsu Curry and added a fried egg. When we ordered the server warned us there was only one cook, and that service would be a little slow. I didn't mind at first, but after over an hour of waiting, I started to wonder if we should go elsewhere. They did give us some jello straws to snack on while we waited, I appreciated the gesture, but didn't really care for the jello.  Once we got our food, I was a little disappointed with the portion size. As far as taste, the curry was flavorful and the katsu was cooked well. It was tasty, but not worth waiting over an hour for.    They gave us a complimentary dessert for the excessive wait time, a chocolate cake with a Chantilly sauce.   I checked in on yelp and got my topping free which was nice. It's a bit pricey considering how much you food you get. I did like how customizable their menu was, but the combinations add up quickly. Without any extras, and the free topping deal, my Katsu Curry was $9.  The food was okay, but the slow service was disappointing. They did try to make up for it, and I appreciated that so for now this place gets 3 stars from me. I may have come here on an off day, so I'd like to give it a second chance and edit my review!"}
{"text":"I came here late one night after First Friday, I'd never had this style of curry before so this was a new experience for me. But I thought it was great! I had the rice and curry with chicken katsu topped with an egg. The prices are good and I loved the endless edamame!"}
{"text":"Funny thing is that my lady and I are on a whole healthy clean eating phase for the month of May, but I just couldn't picture me eating the sweet potato, chicken breast, asparagus and quinoa plate we prepared for lunch today.  Shhh, don't tell her.  Thus, Yelp to the rescue!  I popped in nearby eateries and got a hit for Manna, a Korean joint that has 4+ stars with 15 reviews.  Further investigation was warranted...little did I know that the place was a food court, right under my nose not more than two blocks away.   The first place I bumped into was Kaba Curry, a place ran by a buddy of my be and I have never been able to try it since I am rather find of my own home made curry.  Interestingly enough, there were four other joints in here including Manna, Wing King, Weeziana and Counter Cuisine, all of which I need to take a train check on since they all have menus that sound amazing.  Yet today, is Kaba Curry day!  I asked my boy what was good, he replied, \"go with the Kaba Loco.\"  So I did just that.  The dish includes a hinge made hamburger patty topped with an over easy egg on for scoops of white rice drowned with Japanese curry and a rich of red pickled ginger.  The buggah broke da mout but could be a little bigger imo!  I smashed on it so quick that I regret not taking my time.  So I ended up grabbing a spam musubi at Manna.   Although the initial trip was to try out Manna for the first time, not knowing that my co workers and I would run into a hidden hole in the wall food court just outside CSN.  A blessing in disguise indeed.  I noticed lots of people asking for Kaba's cheese cake as well, unfortunately they were out, but it looks like it's all the rave.  I will most certainly be back to try the other menu items as well.  Best believe.  In addition, you can expect me to be back to try out the other nearby eateries as well.  I hear that they throw little gaming functions and other events here as well, so eager to see how that plays out as well.  Thus is my new favorite spot within the vicinity of work HQ."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of curry, so eating here for the first time was akin to living on the edge for me.  However, it was for a good cause as a group of Yelpers dined here after bringing donations for Typhoon Haiyan victims.  I liked the simple menu:  choose a base of curry with rice, udon, fried rice, or fries and then proceed to add to sides to the base, from chicken katsu, lumpia, fried shrimp, to gyoza, corned beef hash, and fried Spam.  Plus, you can add toppings, as well (corn, mushrooms, cheese, to name a few).  According to the menu, you're also supposed to choose your spice level, but we weren't asked what level we'd like.  I'm glad my food wasn't spicy because I'm wimpy that way.  The b/f and I were hungry when we arrived and just got hungrier as we waited for our food to arrive.  It took a bit longer than normal, I assume, because there were a lot of us there.  I started with the roti and curry, which disappeared quickly--good stuff!  The b/f got the loco moco with chicken katsu and karaage.  My main meal of chicken katsu, Portuguese sausage, korroke (potato croquette) with curry and white rice didn't arrive until at least ten minutes after.  (I actually wanted fried rice, but they were sold out.)  It's never fun to watch someone else eat when you're hangry, but at least the b/f shared.  When my meal arrived, it was good, but I didn't really need the curry or eat much of it; that's just my personal preference.  I was content with the chicken, sausage, and rice--very much like eating dinner at my mom's house.  Service was good and it was nice to try something different--now I know what Japanese curry is like."}
{"text":"CLOSED at 8:15pm on a Friday night.   They are listed as being open until 11pm on their website, yelp, and on the door.  No note on the door. Nothing. Emergency? Is this a regular thing now? No idea. Not cool.  Drove 30 min to get there from way across town. Huge waste of time. They should have been open another 3 hours. We even went earlier than the other people that complained about them closing early, figuring they'd still be open this early on a Friday night. Nope!  We all only went there because we were curious. Normally we go to Zen curry across the street.  Well, back across the street we went. At least their hours are dependable and they never let us down.   Not sure if we'll ever go out of our way again for these guys.   But if you look at their other negative yelp reviews they have a bad bad habit of jerking around customers regarding their hours.  Apparently early sudden closure happens a lot.  If you really want to go, call first I suppose and hope they keep their word. They could actually have great food! But I'll never know."}
{"text":"I have been driving/searching countless times to neighboring states/cities just to find some good Japanese Curry, after having KABA Curry, I can officially say that this is best Curry there is in LAS VEGAS!!!  The price points are on point with the servings. The staff was great! 10 STARS!!"}
{"text":"Such a great move from the old location. They have up graded the menu and look. The staff has their unique styles in fashion and are very polite. I have never been a fan of Curry but after tasting this particular type of Japanese Curry I have been always coming back and a huge fan.  Its funny to read the other comments on how Kaba is compared to other curry places, this is to review a place and not to compare, there are other apps to do comparisons like the IMAGOO App. buwahahaha...  I can tell you that Kaba Curry is the first Curry House to hit Las Vegas.   With a spacious venue I am not rubbing elbows with people while trying to eat or bumping the chairs of other people trying to get to the restroom to wash my hands.  Its priced reasonably for the average foodie. There are a lot of topping/ side selections to choose from so you can be creative with your own dish. If you think you can make curry better at home then stay at home and write a review on your own cooking. hahaha (hence Chris C's Review) haha. Who doesn't know how to cook their own rice and fry an egg? lol"}
{"text":"Kaba Curry is a curry house, Japanese? Hawaiian? I'm not really sure but all I know is it is good. Today I had the loco moco. As a fan of loco moco's I've had them growing up and it was a very fresh take on the Hawaiian Classic. I was brought here by my friends recommendation and was happy to come here. The interior decorations were simple but was very comfortable. The wait staff was kind and helpful suggesting popular foods and some tasty additions to any curry.  Overall an enjoyable experience I hesitate on giving a five at the moment because I would like to come in again. They will have plenty of times to change my mind."}
{"text":"Overall this almost got 4 stars. I have tried the curry with vegetables and the chicken katsu curry. The portion of vegetables was a little small, the flavor was good not great, and the chicken katsu was very good. A solid place that I might go back to in a pinch."}
{"text":"The curry is absolutely horrible. My boyfriend and I went here and the service was slow, food was gross, and the owners seemed more interested in their friends than the other customers. Like another reviewer stated, they take a very long time to make your food. I was hungry and looking for a quick bite. In total, it took 30+ minutes to order my food and have it prepared. They were by no means busy as there was another couple and a group there aside from my boyfriend and me. When the food came, we were less than satisfied. I can honestly say I can make curry better and faster than they can. The tonkotsu was also very salty and overcooked. There are many good places to eat in spring mountain. That being said, I will never return here again."}
{"text":"Had sampled some Kaba Curry at past Yelp events in 2012. Recently I was finally here at the brick and mortar abode of Kaba Curry to ordered and tried their entree portioned curry rice + spam katsu (love the non-mail related spam but surprisingly never had it prepared this way before).  The curry was decent, but the spam katsu was a total treat for my mouth. If you love spam, then I highly recommend this side order for your curry order.  Their menu is pretty simple and digitally displayed on their flat screen monitor. You decide if you want their [A] Kaba Loco Moco Special or [B] choice of steamed rice, cheese fries or fried rice ($4.99 to $5.99) with your curry order and tack on as many sides ($1-$2 each) and toppings ($0.50-$0.75 each) as your wallet and stomach can handle. Oh yeah, can't forget [C] desserts.  Fork over the mullah or swipe the plastic. Then wait patiently... and select one or more of the following optional activities or one of your own creation: meditate, people watch (if there are any interesting characters around) or stare deeply into your cell phone as time slowly drains away from your invisible life meter... while waiting for your name to be called,  then walk briskly back to the order window/counter to pick up your order for immediate or near future digestion.  The service was good and friendly on my visit. But it took a bit longer than expected for the food to be prepared and available for consumption. Luckily I was there with some friends, so I did not have to scroll through myriad images posted on Instagram or otherwise distract myself with other mobile games on the phone.  Will I be back? I most certainly think so.  Food:  3.5/5  Katsu-fied Spam for the win.  Service:  3/5  Friendly, courteous, but not fast food take-out quick as I thought it would be.  Price/Value:  ?/5  It all depends on how extensively you want to customize your meal.   Parking:  5/5  You are in the wrong parking lot if you can't find parking (unless CSN students park here during class).    Definitely A-OK amigos for this local food court option near the Charleston campus of CSN."}
{"text":"One thing I really miss from Hawaii is curry. Specifically curry from CoCo Ichibanya. For a very long time, I have been saying that Vegas needs a curry restaurant. Lately, it seems like my wish has been granted! To be honest, the husband and I drove to the \"other curry place\" first. After seeing how small and crowded the place was, and noticing how many people were waiting outside, we decided to try out Kaba Curry instead.   The location is a bit odd - found near the entrance of a Internet cafe/food court. But it's not too far away from home, so I can't complain. At least you won't have to worry about waiting for a table here, which is a plus. The menu is small but simple. I have only tried the chicken katsu and will continue to order it because it is the Bomb!! Lightly breaded (not heavy), moist, and easy to cut into pieces without a knife. I don't know how they do it, but they make it so perfectly! I wish I could make chicken katsu that well at home. It is seriously that awesome, you won't be disappointed! The curry is thick and chunky with small pieces of carrots (I believe) but you can't taste them at all. Trust me, I don't really eat carrots. It is also a little sweet and slightly spicy, but not to the point where my mouth is on fire. I am also hoping that they will have a brown rice option in the future.   As you can tell from my check-ins, I have already been back a few times and will be back for many more. We met and talked with the owner, who is from Hawaii. Even a better reason to support this curry business! Don't forget to check in on yelp to receive one free topping! Also, follow them on Facebook because sometimes they close early due to holidays or events that are going on and will announce thier hours.  Hooray for an awesome curry place in Vegas! Finally!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Kaba Curry for a long time. The last time was when they were at the food court on Charleston. It was finally getting cold here in Vegas, so it was the perfect time to eat curry and visit the new location. I'm glad that they have an actual restaurant now, because let's be honest here, that food court was deserted and kind of sad. I was a little disappointed not to see the friendly faces of Anthony and Maki when we walked in. They were always present at the old location.   The menu had changed quite a bit, but in a good way. It was nice to see more options for sides and toppings, as well as some new desserts. Now you can also choose spice levels, which doesn't apply to me since I stay away from spicy foods, but I know that people like to have the option.  The restaurant was clean and spacious. The employees were friendly and attentive. Our food came out quickly and the Chicken Katsu was still as awesome as before. My only complaint? Well, maybe two. First, the temperature of the curry was disappointing. No, I don't want my curry to be boiling hot, but I definitely don't want it to be at room temperature either. Yes, it was that bad. I guess it was partly my fault because I could have complained. But on the other hand, I didn't know these employees. What if they got mad about me complaining and spit in my food? LOL totally kidding. But seriously, lukewarm curry does not taste good! This second one is more of a suggestion than a complaint. It would really be nice if they had brown rice as an option, even if there was an extra charge for it.   They have a \"frequent grubbers card\" so make sure you ask for one if they forget to offer it to you.  2 stamps = a free drink 4 stamps = a free side 7 stamps = a free meal!  I'm hoping that we just went in on a off day. Winter is around the corner, so I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Best Japanese Curry place evah!~ A couple of my friends and I decided to come in to eat here and they were absolutely amazed at their first curry house. :D The menu has basic kurry type meals that you can add things on to it in order to make it your own. I always order big, because I have a huge appetite so I ordered the regular kaba curry  meal with spam katsu, lumpia, and extra rice. (This is where the plating deceived me which you will know exactly what I'm talking about when you order. ;o ) I thought it wouldn't be filling, because the pictures look small. ): BUT I WAS SO WRONG. I was soo full at the end of the meal. The atmosphere makes you think of an \"All That\" 90's cafeteria, which is very nice for the young vibe there. But bring your whole family and order some Kaba Curry. It's a very nice Japanese curry place. ^___^~"}
{"text":"Hi everyone...I'm Rose and I'm a kabacurryholic.    I decided to bump it up another star because I can't get enough of the curry here.  I am seriously addicted.  Although it is a food court that caters to college kids, the curry has me coming back again and again.  I take my orders to go.  And I have to do everything in my power not to tear open the bowl of curry goodness while I am driving.    In my previous review, I was disappointed that I did not have a say in the spice level.  Well, I was wrong- all I had to do was just ask.  Ask and you shall receive.   Be on the lookout for the yellow signage in front of the building, guiding you to the land of perfect potato croquettes and delicious curry. I may just have to stop in later today...before the withdrawal tremors kick in."}
