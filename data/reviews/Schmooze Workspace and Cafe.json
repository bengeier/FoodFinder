{"text":"They are still in their \"soft opening\" but what a WONDERFUL space! Outdoor seating is a dream and inside is very unique!"}
{"text":"My new favorite cafe purely for the environment. Someone really thought through everything when putting this place together. It's gorgeous and comfortable and an excellent workspace. The coffee's a bit pricier but you're paying for ambiance, and the freedom to stay as long as you please."}
{"text":"Fantastic new local spot to relax or work and get coffee, tea, or something to eat. Nice landscaping, tables, rocking chairs, fountains and subtle tunes allow for a peaceful environment to spend a morning or afternoon. They even have private workstations available as well. The staff is so polite and helpful, and willing to make your custom coffee creation with a smile. Espresso, cappuccino, latte, or straight up all of the coffee and tea is the best you can get anywhere (trust me I've tried everything). They have started making freshly made cinnamon rolls and will be offering more food variety like a salad bar, breakfast, and lunch items. If you live, work, or are visiting Old Town Scottsdale you need to stop into one-of-a-kind Schmooze Coffee & Juice Bar."}
{"text":"This is beyond. My new spot for sure. Tranquil, toms of great seating, and lots of professionals networking. LOVE"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful place 
Very charmed to see this lovely vibrant establishment  built in the space that once was occupied by art galleries left empty for some time.
I am happy to see this place help revamp Marshall wa
I think they will do very well here
The patio is an garden oasis pet friendly 
Beautiful fountains and a relaxed atmosphere 
Great place to meet with friends and relax grab some coffee, I tasted their coffee and it is delicious and I would know for I am a huge coffee snob
Such a gorgeous place our little oasis in the grueling Arizona summers."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is awesome. The coffee and kombucha are amazing! Strongly recommend. When it's nice out the huge patio is to die for... Hundreds of vibrant blooming flowers, fresh landscaping, and water features make for a good photo opp."}
{"text":"Beautiful inside and outside, great coffee, tasty snacks, and friendly staff. A great addition to the Old Town area."}
{"text":"Great scones, coffee and atmosphere. A wonderful new place to visit. Meet a friend for coffee or stop in to get caught up on your emails. Soft music so you can talk and conduct business.

This is like the neighborhood 'Cheers'."}
{"text":"Great place to knock out some computer work or have a meeting. I work from home so a change in scenery was very welcome! I got the kombucha on tap and picked an individual table. The guys behind the counter told me they're putting in a salad bar! Long story short, it's a gorgeous place and great work space... unlock Starbucks it's QUIET and the people there are focused on working instead of socializing."}
{"text":"A very unique and fun coffee shop concept. This is a combination workspace/coffee shop in a comfortable environment that's infused with humor. And since most of us are humor-deprived in our daily lives I genuinely? appreciate their efforts.

You can work at one of the tables or rent a space if you need privacy to talk on the phone or work on your computer. 

I got their homemade hummus plate which was really delish. After I ate the veggies, I finished the last of the hummus with a spoon. It had a very nice, smooth texture. The latte with extra hot coconut milk was really good. The coffee had a slight hint of mocha and was very smooth. 

Highly recommended. They've crossed modern industrial with a lot of natural beauty in the gardens and it's a great place to hang out or have a business meeting."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to drink coffee, work on my computer, and meet friends! There is a very energetic yet peaceful vibe to this place! And it is cozy yet spacious... the service is amazing and it is so clean and fresh! I highly recommend it over those coffee places that were so yesterday:)"}
{"text":"I love this coffeeshop/workspace! The coffee is delicious and their space is absolutely fantastic. Plenty of places to work (including adorable little London phonebooths for privacy) and a fantastic patio. Can't wait for their food menu to be launched!"}
{"text":"I went to get some work done at Schmooze for the first time last week and it literally took my breath away at the front gate.  The patio is spacious and stunning with a peaceful fountain!  I was wishing that it wasn't 100 degrees so I could enjoy it!  I had the barista choose which flavor of iced tea to order and he decided upon the coconut-- delicious and it will be difficult not to order that every single time!!!  I sat inside in a comfy desk chair and table that supplied its own outlet up above and pounded out some work while others around me did the same.  As a teacher with a summer that's dwindling away, it was fun to be a part of the work crowd that doesn't have to report to a building for work!  I'm going to create more work for myself just so I can go back to Schmooze every day for the rest of the summer!  No joke.  Literally obsessed."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for a place like Schmooze to open in Old Town for a while! The ambiance inside makes it the perfect spot to work on your laptop or hang out with friends on the gorgeous patio. Only downside is that they close at 5 during the week and at 4 on the weekend. Makes it hard for those who work a 9-5 and need a place for after work."}
{"text":"Beautiful space. So much room to study. The chairs are comfortable and it's really quiet. Coffee was decent, can't complain"}
{"text":"So this place is seriously amazing. Great coffee. REAL New York bagels.... I'm a New Yorker so I know. Friendly people. Great staff. Go check it out. You won't want to leave."}
{"text":"The atmosphere itself is reason enough to go here, beautiful flower beds and a water fountain make it a calming environment to read or catch up on work. We went in on the first day it opened, so they were still putting some things together (like the food case.) The owner was super friendly and answered all of our questions about the space, and equipment. They roast Press coffee beans, and their espresso machines are high end and produce excellent coffee. I will definitely be spending a lot of time here!"}
{"text":"This is a big, gorgeous open space for either solo work or meetings.  There is a nice elegant garden outside which has a very \"Scottsdale\" feel to it and the inside is an industrial aesthetic which has a generous number of outlets around the window space to allow you to set up shop and gaze while you work.    There is a combination of couches, office chairs, and stools to serve various needs.  Bring clients, hold your next startup meeting, or just sit at the window and study.  The space itself is 5/5

The coffee and food are also excellent.  The prices are a little higher than I'm used to at Cartel but I can vouch for both the cappuccino and scones. I ordered one and the barista brought it to me as soon as it came out of the oven!  Buttery and very flavorful.  I was not a fan of the $5 Alpha Dominche coffee but that may have been a stylistic difference in how it was extracted. 5/5

If you're looking for somewhere to take a client in the morning or choose a popular business meeting spot, this is definitely a great choice."}
{"text":"This is the nicest and most unusual \"coffee shop workspace\" in town...and maybe anywhere on this planet for that matter. There are just as many cozy spots inside this eclectically cool place to hang out /eat/ sip and \"schmooze\" as there are outside, in the beautifully landscaped and shaded water-featured courtyard. Need to do work?  You can do it here in one of their AV equipped  conference rooms, or just settle into a quiet secluded corner  and get it done alone or with a group.  Need to make a private phone call? Step into one of the funky techy \"phone booths\" and chat away in private.  By the way, let's not forget the coffee. They offer the best drip I've had in town,  along with a menu of espresso drinks, Nitro & Cold Brew from a tap, and a seriously tasty Kombucha.  Wi-Fi is strong. Personnel super friendly.  I think the owner, Johnny Launch, hit a home run here and this place has become my favorite destination coffee/workspace/ meeting place every day of the week. I can't wait to see him perform on the bandstand in the back courtyard as I've heard he's as much a talented singer/dancer/ entertainer as he is a visionary for unusual business concepts like this one."}
{"text":"Beautiful location and concept! Coffees are great and their.pastries too. Great place to bring your laptop and do some work or just stop by after a bike ride"}
{"text":"This place is great. Their internet is fast AF. The espresso is on point. Outlets are everywhere. Steve hit the sweet spot with this place. The coffee and tea selection is legit. If you're looking for a great place for coffee, or if you just need space to knock out emails in Old Town, this is the spot. And the rumor is that a full liquor license is in the works too. Can't wait to have a beer on the awesome patio in the evening. 5 stars."}
{"text":"If you want to enjoy the perfect cup of coffee In a tranquil, and beautifully designed place, then this is the caf√© for you. Absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"Best co-working space EVER.  Wifi is screamin' fast. Gardens are meticulous. Great blend of modern and cozy. The owner has bagels flown in from NYC weekly. Bring your laptop, plan a meeting. 

Visiting Scottsdale from Charlotte, NC on a workation. Member of WeWork, but there aren't any here. I'll be here at Schmooze daily."}
{"text":"Solid cold brew. Outstanding lattes and latte art. Great atmosphere. Spacious, but cozy. Decor is unique and welcoming.  Will be back."}
{"text":"This is by far the coolest coffee shop/work spot ever! I love the atmosphere and quietness. I came here to get some LSAT prep done and it's a wonderful place to sit for hours. Due to climbing temperatures, I sat inside, but the outdoor area is breathtaking! It's so comfortable you feel like your in your own backyard. My green tea was delicious and scone, freshly baked. I also saw they laser designs on their lattes. So cool. This is one of the best kept secrets of Scottsdale. I want to tell everyone about this place, but also keep it nice and quiet. But honestly, it's amazing. Schmooze, you're my new best friend!!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful space to work out of! I love Schmooze!!!! Great environment and amazing coffee!!!"}
{"text":"Finally... a cup of coffee that was smooth, rich and delicious. I typically make my own coffee and forego the coffee shoppe experience due to the utter disappointment. This place has it all..Spacious, beautiful decor and outdoor  garden feel. It's more than a coffee shoppe.. versatile space options for business meetings and just hanging out. They even served my coffee in a mug after asking if I was staying in. Definitely on my favorites list."}
