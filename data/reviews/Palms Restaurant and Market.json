{"text":"Palm Kabab is a real gem.  They have the best lamb I have ever eaten anywhere in America.  My wife and I stopped by for our first visit three days ago.  She ordered the Greek Salad and I had the lamb shank.  As advertised, my lamb shank was delicious and fall-off-the-bone tender.  We went back after church today for lunch.  My wife is not much of a lamb fan so she ordered the chicken souvlaki kabab.  They were out of lamb shanks but the owner suggested roast lamb.  I agreed and was again pleasantly surprised at how wonderful their lamb was.  My wife also raved about her chicken souvlaki.  We will be definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Try this place. Though it is in a strip mall and doesn't look like much inside, a few tables and a market, it is well worth the stop for the food. So far I have had both the steak and chicken shawarma as well as the lamb shanks. Each fantastic. Shawarma has a distinct nutmeg taste--hard to find at other places and the way I like it. Hummus is also spot on. This place pickles vegetables for its sandwiches and on the side of the plate meals. Wife loves this place, too. This is now our go to place for Mediterranean food. Looking forward to the owner getting the bake oven going soon for fresh baked bread."}
{"text":"B and I were on our way to the movies when we spotted this little place, and since we were hungry, we decided to stop and give it a try. 

B ordered the lamb shank and I ordered the Kefta kabob plate. The food was a little slow in coming out, but when it  did it was pretty darn good. 
The lamb came with a bowl of jus, basmati rice, a side salad, pickles, and a bowl of warm pita. It was moist and falling right off the bone. Next time I just might order this for myself. 
My kefta was also very good. It also came with rice, grilled tomatoes, side salad, a few pickles, and warm pita bread. 

The portions are very generous and the quality of the food is great for the price. 

I'll definitely be back.

Give this small unassuming restaurant a try...I don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Review based on Gyro.  Menu says \"hand carved\" seasoned meat.  Nope.  Frozen pre-made slices consistent with dog food.  No thanks.  Had a little of my friends steak, not bad but not enough to come back to."}
{"text":"The food here was very fresh and tasty! They also have an awesome little market here with all kinds of neat goodies! Check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is closed and moved to a new address in West Greenway side. If you visit this location you'll see a small note on door with the new address. Yelp for Palms Restaurant on West Greenway road."}
