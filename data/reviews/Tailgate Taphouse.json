{"text":"Very nice and modern sports bar just opened in our neighbourhood, Elgin Mills & Yonge. Lots of big screen TVs, cozy booths, and best wings in town. The owner told us they get fresh wings from the farm. The bar has a contemporary ambiance and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is a brand new bar and restaurant.  Ordered the Voodoo Chicken Sandwich with fries. It was good but nothing exceptional. The staff were great but needed a little polish. This may come with time.  I really hope they get more customers as the place was struggling a bit. They had a DJ but he was the only one dancing.  Fingers crossed."}
{"text":"Since tilted kilt Richmond Hill closed I have been searching for a sports bar in Richmond Hill. The search is finally over!  Plenty of seats. Plenty of screen to watch the game. Great selection of food and drinks. Pinball machine. Friendly bartender. Perfect place to grab some snack, a pitcher, and watch the game. Next time I will try some food."}

{"text":"Came here on a whim and was impressed by how well done the interior was. This location was home to numerous restaurants before tailgate taphouse and the only one I could remember was galaxy diner from the mid 2000's. Since then many restaurants have tried and failed at this location but here's hoping that tailgate taphouse stays!  I ordered beer and a chicken sandwich. The beer was good, fair pricing not far off what you'd expect st a suburban bar. Great choice in beers as well. The food could use some improvement. Really wish there was a bit bigger portions when it comes to the sandwich itself. The fries were great, you can tell the potatoes aren't frozen and instead are cut fresh. Ambiance is great as well. Owner a very nice man. I'll return for sure!  Ambiance 5/5 Beer 4/5 Food 3.5/5"}
