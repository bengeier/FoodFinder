{"text":"Great place, I'm not from around pitt but i stopped in with my girlfriend for light up night. Great food, awesome customer service not to mention the atmosphere! Definitely stop in."}
{"text":"Place is pretty simple, cheap and the pizza is nice and oily, but warm out of the oven."}
{"text":"The five star gives to the cute young lady who used to work here. Besides, the food is great. I always get a plain slice and chicken tenders"}
{"text":"What do you want an Italian Restaurant to be?

Cheesy.  Saucey.  Greasy.  Tastey.  That is what describes my party's mozzarella sticks, jalapeno poppers, onion rings, fries and my Steak Calzone.

I was taken here during my lunch break from work and I was not disappointed.  There were more than enough workers to compensate for the lunch rush.  The food was prepared fresh and fast.  The prices were cheap and fair.  The portions were huge and caused a nice food coma during my business trip to \"PGH.\"  Thus, I would recommend going here on Thursday or Friday lunches..because everyone knows...no work gets done Thursday and Friday afternoon anyways q=)."}
{"text":"Basic pizza place in downtown Pittsburgh.  The prices are very reasonable - each cut, thick or thin, is $1.85, with toppings at 30 cents per topping.  I ordered two cuts of the thick Sicilian square pizza, which were quite good.  The crust was airy on top and very crispy on bottom.  They also have fountain drinks (refills are 25 cents), or you can order bottled drinks from a vending machine.  

The wait staff was friendly, and the food comes out relatively quickly.  They have plenty of seating, including a dining room upstairs.  I highly recommend Mamma Lucia if you want quick basic and Italian food/pizza at very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Are u kidding me???  
This place is a downtown Pittsburgh 'staple' for at least 30 years.  Their food is delicious, always a daily special and you cant go wrong with anything you order.."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken salad around! They are generous with the toppings and everything is fresh and tastes great. Staff is kind of rough, so be quick with your order!!"}
{"text":"A heavy hand touches everything at Mama Lucia's, unfortunately their generosity with toppings and serving sizes end up hurting the final product. I stopped in for lunch and ordered 2 slices (one with pepperoni and olives the other with mushrooms and sausage) and a side salad. Both slices were a nice size, however, the way they were served created an awkward eating situation. Rather than topping two individual slices they topped half of a 4 cut pizza to match my order. The slices were also an odd shape, essentially they were the chode of the pizza world (wider than they were long). This made it nearly impossible to pick them up and eat them by hand without getting sauce from ear to ear. They also violated my number 1 pizza sin and overloaded the slices with cheese. This made for a doughy center were the crust was slightly undercooked. 

Their over loading of the cheese didn't stop at the pizza. My side salad came topped with an honest cup and a half of mozerella cheese. Underneath the white blanket there was a huge handful of red onion, a tomatoe slice, and some bland iceburg. On a positive note, they do make a great homemade vinegarette.

Each day of the week they have a $3 lunch special. One of my co-workers always goes on Wednesday for their lasagna (a portion that may not fit in a shoe box). I'd try Mama Lucia's again for a sandwich or pasta, but I'm staying away from the pizza and salad."}
{"text":"Mamma Lucia left a note on the door, it said Sonny move out to the country. But instead I came to the city of Pitt and tried her pizza. Pretty good.

Downtown Pittsburgh doesn't have too many good pizza options even though there are some great shops around the city. Mamma Lucia is probably the best option in downtown but that's not saying much, and it didn't really blow me away. Aiello and Fiori's are the go-to's for me. 

The slices here were decent and not amazing. Parking is really tough around here so come on foot if you can. I had to park with flashers on illegally but at least I got to try the pizza. It has really nice decor as well. Very pittsburghese. I appreciated it. Lets you know exactly where you are."}
{"text":"Great pricing on food! A hoagie, fries, & drink is $6 & some change. They have different daily specials for each day of the week. Monday= 6in meatball... wed =I love the buffalo chicken horead agie and chicken parm hoagie. Their calzones look good. I often order a cash fry (chicken, fries and melted mozzarella cheese. You can add veggies for a small price) Also, if they seem full downstairs, the entire 2nd floor is seating. No worries!"}
{"text":"Calzones are excellent. Highly recommended, very filling and cheap. Pizza is good but not great. Can't beat the price in downtown Pittsburgh, 16 inch for $10.50. Been here four times in two weeks"}
{"text":"Large portions, great ingredients at a low cost. For these reasons we over-ordered, but hey... Leftovers! Not much ambiance (1 star ding), but we found this to be a low-maintenance spot with great Italian food at a great value."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in Pittsburgh hands down.  I've been getting pizza here since 1998 and it's the best.  They have great thick silician slices and I love their very unique sausage topping, it's sliced but crumples and tastes great.  I usually don't get sausage topping given that it's a hit or miss but at this place it's definately a hit.

I highly reccomend it and anyone I have taken to this place always gives it equally high praises no matter what they order."}
{"text":"I have been craving pizza for days so for lunch I grabbed 2 slices and a side salad in an effort to balance my poor decision.  The pizza was greasy and good. The side salad was a handful of lettuce, raw onion, 2 slice tomato and about 2 cups of shredded cheese. So much for healthy...."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall place with lots of local customers. Food was really cheap but very very good! The service was also great. All the employees were nice."}
{"text":"How long has this place been in business? I want to say at least 30 years! Especially since I've been coming here since my art school days when the Art Institute was still on Penn Ave.
Honestly to me this is the best place to get pizza downtown if you want old school goodness. Lots of fancy pizza places to pick from and though I like that style it's just not pizza to me.
The Sicilian slices with extra cheese are so good and they always have decent lunch specials. I'm so hungry I think I'm heading over at lunch today for a slice. 
Never been here? You need to try it."}
