{"text":"This place has the best fry bread I've ever had, and I've had fry bread many times. The  chips are also excellent and were served warm. The prices are reasonable. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place has really good frybread. I had something called the \"buckeye\" which had both red and green chili.  It was oh so tasty.  The spot is very comfortable and clean and if you are feeling like some good fry bread in the west valley you will not be disappointed. They make tortllas also and they told me the chorizo is beef (which is a rare find for those of us who do not eat pork meat)."}
{"text":"me and my husband 8 at the Arizona frybread on Cave Creek today. it is not traditional fry bread as the navajos make but it was light and tasty. they do not allow you to vary from the menu you can't take anything off of your fried bread or add anything to it which makes it a little uncomfortable. the man in the kitchen has all kinds of rules you must follow in his restaurant. I did not like the constant being scolded for wanting to deviate from the fry bread like adding green chilies to it they will not do that. There was no one in the front to help while man was in kitchen so I helped myself to a watermelon drink and was told that only employees are to touch it. I don't think I'll come back I left feeling like I was in kindergarten."}
{"text":"Don't go within 45 minutes of closing time...in fact we won't go again EVER. We showed up half an hour before closing and they wouldn't let us eat inside and had already thrown out the drinks. The food was not really very good and it was quite greasy. I can spend $32 for the three of us at a lot of better places. In fact, I can spend half that and have much better quality food."}
{"text":"I was craving frybread for a few days and decided to stop here , it took me while to decide what to order but i ordered the buckeye i has green and red chili beans cheese lettuce sour cream

I honestly like a supreme chalupa from taco bell better , the green chili tasted horrible they told me its the hottest thing they have but its nasty hot, and the red chili taste like the meat from a frozen microwave burrito 

And to top it off i had a stomach ache the rest of the day 

The people with me had a mojito and a arizona
And they weren't too hsppy with their food 

When we went there was a young guy and a lady working the lady was in a bad mood"}
{"text":"My husband wanted to try out several of the frybread places in Arizona because we don't have them available to us in California other than at powwows, so we ended up here on Sunday because the others were closed. We drove out of our way to try them out. We decided to order the Sampler #2 since I wanted nopales with my frybread. Sampler #2 included four little frybread tacos: one Chicken Mojito, one Southwest, one Nopalito, and one Lil Vincie. We also ordered one of each tamal: green chile and red beef. I also ordered a sandia agua fresca (watermelon), which was quite refreshing for a hot Arizonan day. We shared pretty much everything, and it was very good. My husband really liked the tamales, but we are aficionados of the stuff. We would definitely come back to this place if we could."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. Free refills on aqua fresca. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The fry bread was delicious, it was just a bit slow. We got the desert sampler and it was so good."}
{"text":"I brought a first date here bad bad idea on top of the rude service we received from the Guy with the lisp or whatever that was which set the tone for a bad dining experience the restaurant was dirty inside not pleased with my choice food was good or so I thought we both ended up getting so sick shortly after date ended I don't think ill ever make the mistake of trying a first date at a dung hut like this without reading the comments again btw this ain't a fake account I just made it to warn others don't make the same mistakes I did"}
{"text":"The fry bread is AMAZING and the toppings were DELICIOUS!!!!

The girl taking the orders was not the friendliest though and I had several chewy chips.

Regardless, we will be back at least once a week for sure, and we'll hope the girl is in a better mood next time."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant when they were located in Buckeye. I have tried everything on the menu probably more than once and have never been disappointed. My favorite is the Red-Chili Frybread with cheese added. The service is excellent there. You always get treated friendly and with a smile!"}
{"text":"The missus has been craving fry bread for a while and was ecstatic that we found a place in the west valley.  We brought our daughter so she could experience this culinary delight for the first time. 

Pros: 
It is located in the west valley. 
The front of the place is clean. 
They have a good selection of items on the menu. 

Cons:
Price - two meals, one dessert, and two drinks was $30. 
Meals: while the food looked appetizing the portion size was small and required the mild/hot salsa to improve the flavor. Very bland. 
No substitutions - we wanted to get the dessert sampler and change one of the items from raspberry to sugar cinnamon, they wouldn't budge. I would've paid for an up charge to make this happen. 
Drinks - $2.30 per drink and no To-go cups. Very strict on the \"no outside food or drinks\"

Sadly the missus and youngest were not impressed."}
{"text":"First time eating here and YUM!  Delicious fry bread and green chili is the perfect accompaniment.  Will definitely be back.  We picked it up and place was clean and inviting.  Great for a cold and rainy day."}
{"text":"Yummy frybread. My fil brought food from this place
Was my first time trying fry bread  nd really like it.
Planning to go back with all my Fam."}
{"text":"We love this place,  we were referred there and sooo glad.  Everything is fresh, best Fry bread ever.   The tamales are also great especially the beef one.  Go you will not be sorry."}
{"text":"A Little Hidden Gem...

My boyfriend loves fry bread. And since I don't cook it, I figured I'd research on Yelp some places that make it. 

The area that this place is located in is quite busy (cave creek & bell). Was fairly easy to find. It's a small store front and had a few people dining inside.  

We bought the \"Arizona\" fry bread and the dessert sampler (to go). Both were very good. Items were fresh. The service was pleasant as well. 

Now that we've discovered this place (through Yelp), we are in trouble. Lol. Will visit again."}
{"text":"Horribly incompetent wait staff. Food was really lacking in quality & they did not offer honey. While the bread was decent a 2 star rating is more than generous."}
{"text":"Didn't even get a chance to order. I wanted the one with beans and green chilis, but I wanted to add chicken to it. Shouldn't be an issue to add something, especially when I made it clear that I was willing to PAY EXTRA for it. The girl at the register wouldn't budge, said everything was made EXACTLY as stated on the menu and NO changes could be made. Not even for an extra charge. What an asinine statement for a small business, and idiotic to be unwilling to accomodate a customer request that would have brought in more revenue. I won't give my money to a business with terrible customer service like that. My husband and I went to Del Taco next door instead, which seems to have been the better-tasting option anyway after reading the other reviews. We won't try Arizona Frybread again. Get a clue about how to cater to your customers. Your cashier girl just cost you our business for life."}
{"text":"Ive been going to AZ frybread house for many years, now they're closer to me & the menus so impressive.  Try it!"}
{"text":"My mom lives in Avondale, so I went here when I visited her. 

I ate here two Tuesdays in a row -- once for lunch and once for dinner, and the quality was consistently good.

TASTE: DELICIOUS! 

I normally avoid fried food, but these frybreads did not feel heavy or overly greasy to me. 

For lunch, I had the chicken mojito frybread. They describe it on their website as \"Grilled chicken in a lemon lime base sauce we call \"Mojito\" topped with cheese, lettuce & sour cream \" I liked the sauce. It was not too much lime.

For dinner, I had a combo (FB #1: 1 red chile, 1 green chile, 1 Arizona, & 1 bean and cheese... the Arizona has beans, cheese, ground beef, lettuce, tomatoes, & sour cream). I couldn't decide, so it was fun to get a variety of small frybreads. My preferences in descending order were: Arizona, green chile, bean and cheese, and red chile. I didn't like the red chile -- the texture of the sauce was weird to me. The flavor was decent, but the sauce was a bit thick or something. Let me emphasize that all of the other three in the combo were great, though! Yum!

AFFORDABILITY: GREAT!

The lunch portions are slightly smaller and are sold in combos with drinks. I thought that lunch was VERY affordable. (Chicken mojito (lunch size) and a drink for $5.75.) If I lived or worked near here, I would be here for lunch regularly!

Dinner was more expensive, but my issue was with the price of the drink, not the price of the food. The soda was more than $2.00. Yes, there are free refills, but charging over $2 for a fountain drink is just too much. (Note: This is the reason why I did not give this establishment five stars.) 

If you are in Avondale, Goodyear, Tolleson, or Litchfield Park, you should check this place out! If you don't live on the southwest side, I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but if you do drop by, you will not be disappointed.

During lunchtime on a Tuesday, business seemed to be hopping. Dinner time was less busy on a Tuesday, but there was also a balance of people eating in and people taking out."}
{"text":"Terrible frybread, if you can call it that.  overcooked and tasted like the oil in the fryer hasn't been charged in weeks. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Arizona Frybread just opened a couple of weeks ago. I tried the #1Sampler and enjoyed the four items a lot. The red chili, the green chili, the Arizona and the bean and cheese used high quality meats and produce. The actual Frybreads were fluffy and not at all greasy. Thumbs way up on the first visit."}
{"text":"I just find this place and I love it. best frybread ever I totally recommend Arizona frybread buckeye is delicious."}
{"text":"Awful service, beware they dont refund. Didnt stick around to try thr food. I wont eat any place who is rude."}
{"text":"Since moving to the area wanted to try this place... wish we never did.. over priced fry bread tasted like it was cooked in old grease and beans had no taste. . Staff not friendly no plans on returning ..."}
{"text":"I was ready for lunch and looking for something different. I passed by Arizona Fry Bread and decided to give it a shot. The restaurant was clean  with basic decor. 

I ordered the Arizona. I asked for shredded beef instead of ground beef. The cashier told me she couldn't do it because everything was already pre-made. I asked if it was pre-made or fresh. Signs in the restaurant and on line say their food is made fresh everyday. She said it was fresh, but it comes with ground beef! No problem, they then need to put a sign on their menu that says, \"Please, no substitutions.\" 

The fry bread was very good. It was light and soft. The beans and ground beef were average at best. The beans were runny and bland. There was very little ground beef. Again, very bland. There was plenty of crisp, green lettuce, but little cheese and tomatoes. To me, it seemed like they were trying to stretch the servings. 

Overall, it was average. The value was poor, $12 including a drink plus a $0.75 charge for using a debit card. I would very much like to see a local restaurant succeed, but as is, they can't count on me as a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Our go to place after going to Costco, have been here many times and never had a complaint.  It is always very clean.  The food is good, cheap and filling.  The customer service can be a little off =- depending who is working the counter but they seem to have solved that problem recently and I do not judge food by people working the counter -- thankless job if you ask me (especially if they are dealing with some of the people below who left rude nasty complaints).  I see where some people have complained about it being greasy and we have never had that problem -- even after approx 10 visits.  There is never any grease on the paper liner under the fry bread.  The green and red chile are both very good. If you are expecting a fine dining experience this is not the place to go but if you want good, filling food then enjoy!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, you don't find this type of food anymore, so glad they are expanding and getting a better location. Frybread always fluffy and delicious."}
{"text":"The wait was longer than I would have liked, however worth the wait. It might be helpful to let customers know how long to expect the food to take. The Frybread Arizona was super fresh. I love their frybread. The chicken posole was spicy and comes with onions, cilantro and lime wedges."}
{"text":"GREAT FRYBREAD! The red chili and beans were very good. Service was excellent. We will be back to try the posole."}
{"text":"Food great but I have to say that everytime i go there the people running it are rude, not real welcoming."}
{"text":"I love fry bread! Just found this place. We had the Arizona fry bread. It was great! Really loaded with beans and meat, the vegetables on top were fresh and crisp. The star on top was his mother's red chili sauce. It took my right back to New Mexico! We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I am from New Mexico and I love eating Indian fry bread at a lot of the Mexican restaurants. This place was a little disappointing because the fry bread size was really small. Especially for the price. And I didn't find a distinctive taste difference the 4 flavors on the platter I ordered. The flavor was good, and I really liked the 2 sauces they offered."}
{"text":"Our friends recommended Arizona Frybread to us and it was really good. We got the FB#1 special with four different mini fry breads. Their green chili is really good. It was a little to spicy for my husband but I didn't think it was bad at all. The horchata and the melon peach fresca were delicious! Then we had to get dessert so we opted for the sampler. The fry bread covered in cinnamon and sugar was my favorite (kind of like a churro). The place was very clean and the service was very good."}
{"text":"We had a terrible experience with this restaurant. The woman helping us seemed annoyed to be there. When we ordered our food we told her we wanted our chips and salsa to go but we woukd eat thd frybread in the restaurant. She responded by saying \"ok\". When we received our order, she forgot our chips and salsa so we asked her for them. She then proceeded to give us chips in a bowl and salsa in a squirt bottle. We sat down with the chips, took a few bites and then decided to ask for a to go bag for the chips and a container of salsa since we had asked for it to go in the first place. When I asked the woman helping us for some salsa to go it was as if she turned into a monster. She told us emphatically that she has to charge us additional money for salsa because she only charged the in house price for salsa, not the to go price. After listening to her rant ABOUT A SIDE OF SALSA we decided to take the high road, thank her for the food and leave. We will never visit this establishment again, nor do I recommend that you waste your time walking in that place."}
{"text":"I won't be back. This is my seventh time visiting and my first review. This place sucks just look at the photos."}
{"text":"What exactly am I paying for, Just the bread? Because you have to pay for everything on top.   
It's soooooo expensive and the portions are sooooo small. The bread is super thin. If you ask for meat, there will be maybe an ounce of meat. If you want salsa, it's $4 for half a pint.
This place will go under quickly with these prices.
Live and learn, don't go here!"}
{"text":"Don't know why it has been so long between visits to this awesome place. Took my wife here for dinner tonight and everything was outstanding.

I had the Buckeye Ultimate and my wife had the Arizona Frybread and we both thought they were delicious. The bottles hot sauce are awesome and I hope they don't ever quit providing the sauce.

I had the mixed fruit Aquas Frescas and it was the best aquas fresca i have ever had.

It definitely won't be so long before we go back to this place. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This placed just opened up so I figured I'd try it.    Lets just say I will be back for sure.    Awesome!     Pleasantly surprised and it was made to order just like they say.   Frybread tasted perfect, everything was hot and tasted fresh and I also ordered it to-go and it was nice of them to put a paper lining in the container unlike some places when it melts the foam container.    Good job all around.  They also had a huge container of fresh lemonade, didn't see it until I left but will try next time.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went with friends, they loved their lunch special fry bread they ordered. Mine was SUPER salty! Told them I didn't like and they said that's how it comes. No refund. No credit. Nothing. Not coming back."}
{"text":"I've tried to come here twice and these Sons of B****** are closed an hour early!!! What the hell!?!?  Change your hours of operation! So unprofessional Never ever gonna waste my time or gas again... And I will be telling all my family and friends as well!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  I was impressed with the quality of the frybread.  The salsa samples were great too.  Good selection of toppings from very mild to spicy hot."}
{"text":"Worst food try in a long time. Overpriced food that will likely leave you regretting your choice. I ordered the mojito chicken which was disgusting and no chicken to be found. Aguas frescas sign at counter but none available. Moms special was bland and soggy. One person working at 2pm and no customers inside. On its last leg.."}
{"text":"I've been here about 4 times now through out the last 3 years. I love fry bread my husband too that's the only reason we have gone back. (no other fry bread in west valley). We always get the Arizona, nothing special. We recently picked up two this last week and they seemed a lot smaller than before. It had pretty much no meat, a lot of lettuce and yes I agree with a post of 3 months ago the fry bread tasted as if it was fried in old oil. Also pricey for the size and quality of the frybread. Probably won't return for another year or so!"}
{"text":"Everything is delicious!  I have ordered twice through Grubhub their frybreads and desserts.  OMG!  You can't go wrong here!~"}
{"text":"Good customer service. But food is just ok.  Only one table in the back. Booths are small uncomfortable for big people. Probably won't go back"}
{"text":"Great customer service. The guys there are super friendly. We ordered 2 of the Frybread Arizona which have beans, hamburger, lettuce, tomato, onion and sour cream. They were AMAZING! I've had Indian tacos a few times before at an event in California and fell in love. Once I moved here to Arizona I saw this business while shopping one day and couldn't wait to try it. So glad I did! Definitely going back! 
My ONLY small complaint is that there was no music playing and instead they had the TV on with a show about a very awkward topic. It was blasting and it definitely wouldn't have been appropriate for little ones if they were in there. Didn't enjoy that part.

Other than that everything was clean, the service was great and the food was tasty! Recommended!"}
{"text":"Best frybread that I have ever had.  The bean and cheese is great and the green chile is out of this world. This place is a MUST....."}
{"text":"It may be fry bread for some of their offerings, but very light fry bread, not heavy or greasy.   I got red Chile fry bread, wife got the Calabsitas soup, both were VERY good, full of flavor for the unique desert SW flavors and style of food.  We also sampled their green chile pork and potato soup too and wow! that was good and warning for those who don't like spicy, this would be one to sample before getting a bowl.  We will certainly be coming back to this great place with very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Excellent fry bread! Not too greasy, not too soft or crunchy. The green chile is spicy and delicious! I had a tamale too and it was really good.  I will definitely be back next time I am in the area. I got takeout to take back to my hotel and the rest of my family loved the fry bread. This place rocks."}
{"text":"While the actual fry bread isn't bad, it's certainly not great. The green chili meat contains mostly potatoes and a few small pieces of meat if you're lucky. However, the kicker is that after you spend 40 bucks for 3 people and ask for honey for the fry bread they tell you that they don't know how to ring it up so they charge you 89 cents for a half filled tiny 1oz container. So between the service and food, I think two stars is generous."}
{"text":"Good spot for frybread in the Goodyear/Avondale area.  

They use soy oil instead of lard to make their fry bread.   Personally I would prefer if they fried in lard instead.  If that matters to you from a GMO perspective!   I know frybread is a dime a dozen in parts of AZ.....But I do appreciate that the fry bread is made to order and never frozen which makes a huuuuge difference in the world.  I stood there the whole time and saw them making it from scratch.  I'm only giving AZ Fry Bread 4 stars cause I can't get past the bread fried in soy oil.

The menu options are decent for sweet and savory frybread.  They got daily specials and affordable lunch combos.  This location is kept relatively clean to dine in."}
{"text":"Yesterday was the first day me my wife and two kids are here. 
There were a few people in there so I figured , \"it's still in business for a reason\" so we decided to try the Arizona frybread.
Worst mistake of my life!!
I only ordered two items. Fry bread with beans and the quesadilla. 
My stomach has never turned so much in my life. I had acid reflux and diarrhea all night. I threw up more then ten times. Like I had the worse hang over in my life. I was very close to going to the hospital. My daughter turns  4 today.  Poor girl threw up in her paid and on the floor at night. Now today she was supposed to go to a trampoline indoor park, but hey not today.
The male working there didn't seem to happy. Only three things I can conclude. 
Either they put eye drops in our food or they don't wash there hands when they cook. Or undercooked food. If I have the pull I would call the health inspector on these people. Don't go there ever!!!"}
{"text":"Oh this hidden gem has such great Fry Bread! My daughter stated it was better than any at the Arizona State Fair and I have to agree that this is excellent! It's so fluffy and fresh! Beans are amazing! The place is super clean and the customer service was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I didn't think I'd like the food, I was blown away by how delcious and clean this place was"}
{"text":"Great first experience. Wanted to compare to Grandma's frybread and wasn't let down. Tasty!"}
{"text":"I've come here many times. The food is great! I always leave feeling full! The only downside is that it's a bit pricey. But it's pretty damn good fry bread! And the dessert samplers are amazing"}
{"text":"This is the first time that I have been here. It was pretty good and it had pretty good flavor. I have not eaten fried bread in a long time so I can't compare the taste to anything else. We had the Arizona Fried Bread. The salsa tasted good the mild and hot. We had the fried bread desert too and that was good as well. I have to say the price to food ratio is mediocre and there was not a lot of meat on the fried bread. If the owner reviews these I would say show more love with the beans and meat and it would have been a better experience. Oh ya and less lettuce because there was way too much on my fried bread."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today - not impressed at all.  Without knowing really what to order, I ordered the frybread and red chile.  What I got was the greasiest piece of stuff I've ever tried to eat with some red gravy looking stuff on it.  Hardly any meat at all in that gravy.  If I ever do go back, I'll definitely try something else."}
{"text":"Best red chile this side of my future mother-in-law's crockpot.  And although my future MIL's tortilla selection abilities rock, there is no comparison to putting red chile over perfectly crunchy, perfectly chewy, perfectly perfect frybread.  And THEN sending it away with a container of their death-red, smoky, spicy-as-hell salsa which borders on near-perfect.  I have to will myself to eat here as little as possible, as I'd like to make 40. :)"}
{"text":"Had lunch at Arizona Frybread's new location at Cave Creek Road south of Bell Rd.  It was the best fry bread that I have ever eaten.  I had the bean and cheese and my son ordered the green chile topped bread.  Both were excellent.  If you love fry bread, it doesn't get any better than this!"}
{"text":"Worst food ever! Beans were watery af. Rosarita beans are the best compared to these. Might as well shoulda gave me water instead of beans. Waited 40 min for my order. Ordered a family pack of 4 Frybreads. Worst red Chile. Nuthn but water also. No meat! One cook and 1 order taker. Don't think about eating here after this post."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm!!! Everything on this menu is awesome. I never leave unsatisfied. Frybread is perfect. Not too greasy at all. If you haven't tried this place your missing out."}
{"text":"I read many review and was excited to try this place. When I got there they were temporarily closed because they had to go to the bank. I waited though. They took my order and my order came with a pepsi but their machine was down. Instead of offering me something else instead or a discount they just said they were out and couldn't do that. I still was hopeful. I ordered and waited over 30 minutes for my order. While I was waiting another couple came in. The guy at the counter said I will be right with you so they sat down and waited. He never came back to them and so after 20 minutes with out him showing any concern to them, they walked out. I finally got my food and brought it home to my family. The beans were like broth. They were watered down and had no flavor. I could not even put it on my frybread. The green chilly was good. The sampler pack I bought was awful my 13year old said the meet tasted old and weird."}
{"text":"This was my first time having fry bread. It was okay. We were given drink cups that had a white powder inside of them. The cashier told me it was flour. 
My son's fry bread tasted more greasy than mine. I suppose because he had ground beef and I did not. I had bean and cheese. I probably wouldn't go again but I look forward to trying fry bread again at different restaurant."}
{"text":"Frybread is good, but there isn't enough substance. I got some watered down beans, hardly any ground beef and mostly lettuce."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food at reasonable prices. Only complaint is that they only sell cans of soda. This kind of meal requires a big old drink"}
{"text":"Not a Frybread expert but I like this place. I will come back. The green chili was on point I will try some other frybread places but I will be back to this place."}
{"text":"We were in the second day the restaurant was open and had the red chili and the refried bean fry bread. 

The food was good. The fry bread was fantastic and the red chili was decent. The beans were ok as well. Veggies were fresh, the sauces (hot) were fantastic.

The place was clean and the kitchen seemed well organized.

Decor is pleasant enough.

Service was pretty much horrible. The girl up front never smiled once and seemed like she wanted to be anywhere else in the world but there and certainly wasnt interested in helping us in any way which was shocking considering the place had just opened.

I will update with a 4th star if the customer service has improved."}
{"text":"They are never open when they are claiming to be. It is incredibly annoying that every time I come here they have closed earlier than their online info says.  What's the point of even having a restaurant if you aren't going to be open when you're supposed to be. I hate that is the only place in the West Valley with Fry Bread"}
{"text":"The fry bread is GREAT but the price is a little ridiculous. The prices are maybe what you would pay at fair where you know you'd have to pay way more than regular. But like I said the food is really good and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"This place is great, when it's opened. I've driven there two times to find them closed 30 minuets early. When they close at 7pm anyways. STAY OPEN!"}
{"text":"Be sure to come on Tuesday through Friday or it can be kinda pricey."}
{"text":"Disappointing

I was looking for a spot to grab a quick bite to eat. After noticing Arizona FryBread, I decided to give it a shot.
Arizona FryBread is an unpretentious spot serving fry bread, tamales, and various other items.

I went to the restaurant about 11 o'clock and it was completely empty. I walked up to the counter and placed my order. I ordered the fruit sampler, which consisted of strawberry, raspberry, caramel, and chocolate frybread, sprinkled with  powdered sugar. 

The Fry Bread I ordered was soggy, greasy, and lacked any real flavor . The fry bread just wasn't very good.  I'm not sure if it was old oil or just poor tasting in general. 

I'm not in a rush to go back anytime soon. I thought the price was too high for what you receive and there is a  $0.75 for using a debit card.  I would recommend trying somewhere else."}
{"text":"Customer service was great... that's my 3 stars but the food I can not... 0 stars bland no meat no taste red chili con carne... can not recommend ... the one closer downtown way better"}
{"text":"Excellent Christmas fry bread with really nice chilies and a little bit of picante but not too much. Fried bread was tender not too cooked not. too dry, and plenty of good ingredients on top.
They are here supporting the second anniversary of 8-bit aleworks operation. The beers are awesome."}
{"text":"3 stars and they are lucky to get that three stars. The man that made my food took my order with his back turned. Of course when I got home the entire order was wrong. In their defense they remade my food the next time...but with an attitude. 
Also in their defense they have good food and slightly decent customer service. No one has been outright rude to me which as we all know is very hard for white people. But it's obvious they are holding back the hate. 
Anyways a huge criticism I have is that they close and open whenever they want. This is a very very bad business practice. 
I actually just lowered my 3 stars to a 2 because as I'm writing this review the woman just slammed a trey directly behind my head. They have good food...but they look like very VERY rough people.
I changed my review back to 3 bc the owner is a nice woman it's just the fat blonde who is rude."}
{"text":"Good fry bread chilly just wasn't up to my standards I guess you could say. But the fry bread itself was delicious will be coming back. Overall good experience food was hot well-prepared just wasn't really feeling the green chili."}
{"text":"My memories of having frybread come from going to the New Mexico State Fair in Albuquerque every year as a kid.  On the 3 hour drive up from Las Cruces, my mouth would already be watering.  The perfect mix of chile colorado con carne, beans, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and salsa placed ever so tenderly on top of a delicious frybread.  

Well, it was recreated when I took the first bite of my Buckeye Frybread. Red Chile AND green chile!  So flavorful and reminded me of home.

I also have to add that their red salsa is almost...almost as good as my dad makes!

I have no idea why it took me so long to get there...but I know it will be on our go-to place list from now on!  I will be spreading the word as well! 

What a hidden gem in Avondale!!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously good food! The fry bread is so good and not greasy! They serve up big portions so be prepared to eat!  I love that they have expanded their delivery area and I plan on using them a lot for this (especially since the guy who delivers is HOT!)"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today.  There was one woman there cooking & taking orders so service was very slow.  Eventually another man joined her but the wait was still quite long.  The food was more expensive than I thought it should be ($47 for 4 fry breads & 3 drinks). But the worst part was when my daughter discovered a BUG buried in her fry bread.
When I brought the half eaten meal up to the guy behind the counter & showed him the bug I of course asked for a refund  to which he said \"I can't do that, I can only offer you a replacement \"!!!!
Who does that???  The last thing she would want is food from this restaurant, her appetite was ruined! Even telling him this did not change anything.  We just threw the rest of our food away(we had all lost our appetite by then) & walked out.  VERY bad customer service,  I have never heard of someone not getting their $$ back when something like this happens.  SKIP this place, save your money & go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The service was friendly and the cashier knew the menu. The restaurant was clean but sparsely decorated. The food was good but a little pricey for frybread. The toppings were tasty but a little on the light side. I don't have a huge appetite, but I left not quite satisfied. I will go back... The food was good, but I can get a lot more food for my money across the parking lot."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and either time hasn't left a lasting impression so I'm not sure I'll be back. Today I got the Arizona fry bread and it's ok. It comes with sour cream but I asked for no sour cream and instead if they have guacamole. They do not. So I asked if I could have extra salsa instead. They said t comes with one 1oz container and extra would be 
.25. I decided to pay extra for it since I guess I wouldn't get it in sub of the sour cream. I took the order to go so when I got home my three 1oz containers of salsa were not even filled halfway AND there was sour cream on my fry bread."}
{"text":"I have always had Frybread with powdered sugar never had it with actually food.  I met my sister here for lunch.  The place was clean and bright.  We walked up to the counter and ordered.  Make sure you state you want th e lunch special for the meal, drink, and discount.  

I ordered the FRYBREAD w GRILLED MOJITO CHICKEN (Grilled chicken Mojito topped with chesse,lettuce & Sour Cream).  It was good and everything tasted very fresh!!!"}
{"text":"I went here to get my husband a cinnamon and sugar fry bread and I was absolutely blown away at how absurdly over priced it was. One fry bread with only cinnamon and sugar on it was over $5!!! 
I gave this place two stars because the fry bread was good... Just not worth the price in any way."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible! This place should be closed & reported to the health commission! Filthy, rude, inedible...these 3 words sum up this restaurant. Also WAY overpriced...still upset we paid over $50 to make our little family violently ill!  :'("}
{"text":"Had the mom's special and red chili today. The service was good and quick( no one else was in the restaurant).
The mom's special was very good and tasty. The red chili however was a let down. The red chili did not have the expected richness and had hardly any meat, the sauce was thinly spread across the bread. 
My recommendation is to rethink the red chili or at least add more meat-- increase the price of the red chili if you need to make it more cost effective."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. Only get to have frybread when I go to the reservation to visit family. My mom makes the best, so my expectations are high. 
This place is clean, friendly and has several options for everyone to choose from. I got the Arizona works, to go. It was fresh and delicious. I'm so glad I found a place near me, to handle by frybread cravings. 
I will be returning."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Mediocre food quality at best... waaaaaayyyyy under-portioned. Spent over $30 to feed a family of 5, pretty good deal right? No. Their \"kid's meals\" are like Toddler Meals. Their beans are watered down. We have been coming here every now and then for the past 3 years (it's next to Sam's Club) and I can honestly say, that this last visit will be our last. Their portions seem to be getting smaller and smaller."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place for 2 yrs and finally did, unfortunately it fell flat! The fry bread is different from any fry bread I've ever had and doesn't even have that signature yummy fry bread flavor, it was also more doughy than fry bread. Although they offer and array of toppings all that sound quite yummy they were not as much. We ordered the Moms Special and the Devs chicken both very bland and lacking any excitement. Aside from the food the place was pretty warm, they were unwilling to make a chicken quesadilla without lemon lime sauce and they weren't very friendly when we asked. I am giving them 1 star however because when we told them the Diet Pepsi fountain was out they fixed it immediately which was really nice."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try this place, very clean, service was great. I tried the Dev's chicken Arizona and Mom's special...Dev's could use more flavor wouldn't recommend it to a first timer but Mom's special was DELICIOUS. Still want to give more items on their menu a try."}
{"text":"The staff was funny and the shop itself is kept in pristine condition. I would agree with most reviews saying that the meal was bland and that's probably why each meal comes with some type of hot sauce/salsa. The frybread on its own was delicious though so I do have plans to try other meals on the menu."}
{"text":"So I love Indian Tacos at the state fair. This isn't as good. The bread is slightly sweet but has no body to it. Had the mojito chicken fry bread. What little chicken I could find (and there was very little) was mushy and nearly flavorless. Over cooked and totally lacking in flavor. Don't waste your time, money, or calories eating here."}
{"text":"expect to wait for fresh food, made to order. it was great. you should go see for yourself. i enjoyed chicken dav. then got another with honey. yum"}
{"text":"I've been making Frybread for about 15 years, and I've been eating it for much longer. It's not hard to make, yet many people fail to make it right. It can be too greasy, too crispy, too hard, too salty, too baking powder-y. Thus I'm always excited to try someone else's recipe.

Arizona Frybread makes very good frybread. It was perfectly soft, and satisfying to the taste buds. My only negative critique is that it was a bit too salty. Nevertheless, it was not too salty so as to be unenjoyable. 

I ordered frybread with red chili, which was equally delicious. I think I would have liked a bit more meat, however.

Restaurant was very clean. Food was good. Service was helpful and friendly. I'll definitely eat there again.

:-)"}
{"text":"This place might be an affront to any ethnicity that considers fry bread a cultural food. 

Fry Bread - Ok. Other things, not so much. 

Stopped in for lunch while on that side of town and I regretted it with the first bite. Got a sampler (FB 1), which was one fry bread quartered. For things to try, I think red and green chili, and two things with beans. The beans suck. No nice way to put that. Calling them bland might be insulting to the word bland. Our meal pretty much ended with that first bite. Anything with beans got drenched in hot sauce. The rest was ok but just ok. We liked the green chili but it still seemed lacking. The fry bread itself seemed promising but not being able to cook refried beans just ruins this place for me. I might be able to try their desserts but I'm not sure I want to. The lady at the front counter seemed like she didn't want to be there and almost seemed distracted. She forgot to charge the customer in front of us for something as well as us. I'm pretty sure this is the same lady everyone else has noticed the issues with too. 

Honest opinion - Feel like someone learned to make fry bread online and decided they would open a \"restaurant\". The food, especially the beans, all reminded me of my mom trying to cook for us growing up. My mom sucked at cooking and openly admitted it. So when her \"beans\" taste the same as this \"restaurant\", that kinda makes me not want to eat here again."}
{"text":"Visited Arizona and wanted Frybread. Stumbled upon this place. We ordered the Arizona. So yummy! Love how they have an explanation of the Yaqui flag."}
{"text":"Yum ! Had the bean and cheese with all the toppings and not 1 complaint ... Don't judge this place by location or the outside when driving by , if you do you'll be missing out ! Can't wait to try another flavor next time !"}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews but I gave this place 2 tries and both times it was an epic fail.  The shop itself is poorly decorated and arranges, it doesn't strike you like they know what they are doing.  The first visit the owners were running the show and were amazingly rude to my 3 year old.  If I hadn't paid I would have left.   The second time we decided to try their meals and not just the dessert and the fry bread was not only a huge disappointment but I was sick to my stomach all night.  Service is slow and rude and the food makes you sick.... I'd pass on this one unless you want dessert because who can screw up putting sugar and honey on a flatbread?"}
{"text":"They have a great lunch combo that is really reasonable to check out."}
{"text":"I used to go to this place when it was next to the beauty school. Love their fry bread and I always reccomend people try it if they've never had it."}
{"text":"Ive gone here 4 or 5 times over the last few years  and really the only reason i'm writing this review is due to several of the negative reviews. I've never had a bad experience  there. One person commented on their beans being canned - i know what canned beans taste like and its so not anything they serve. I always get either just beans and cheese or honey. I Think their beans are amazing.  I even asked the owner how he made them and he was very gracious  to tell me how to make them in great detail.  It's silly easy, so easy and cheap it doest even make financial  sense  to use canned. I like this place and the owner was very passionate and friendly.  I will be visiting  again."}
{"text":"I still need to make several more trips to this place because everything on the menu looks delicious. I have tried the frybread with the green chile. It is so good. The bread is perfect. The green chile is very good. I have also tasted the red off my husbands plate and that also very good. I recommend this to anyone who loves frybread done right. They also have soups. I need to try the albondigas but everytime I have went they did not have any. I did have the calavacita soup and it is very good, clean tasting and filling they will serve it with plain frybread pieces if you like. They have friendly service and it is very clean and simple. This is place is a hidden jewel. I highly recommend trying it. Oops almost forgot... they have the bomb salsa it is also delicious mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"I have ordered from here twice- and both times food was hot and fresh and very yummy!  No complaints here- will defiantly eat here again!  Keep up the yumminess!"}
{"text":"Next to the Federal Pizza, where I got food poisoning a month or so ago, this is the worst restaurant I have EVER been to. At least the Federal tasted good going down.

I will preface this by saying my boyfriend and I LOVE frybread and LOVE trying new things.  We arrived starving and this was JUST awful.

I got the Frybread Southwest, while my boyfriend got a Frybread with Chicken on it (can't remember which one).  

I have got to be honest.  The frybread was GREAT, but everything else was a disaster.  Both of our dishes had Frybread with canned refried beans piled on top (about a centimeter or so thick) with no meat to speak of and another centimeter or so of garbage shredded lettuce.  There might have been sour cream or a topping, but all we could taste was horrible beans and trash lettuce.  How can a business sustain itself with Walmart store-bought goods? If it isn't, at least fool the customers with some quality.

I have friend's who have tried to make food for me that is absolute garbage. To be honest, I'd have those other meals instead of AZ Frybread ever again.

I hate saying this because they were so nice and welcoming.  Plus we were starving so we would have been happy with anything.  I could not have been more disappointed.  Also, the juices are SO PULPY they are almost undrinkable.  It also seems as though it is a mix of store-bought juice and someone juicing strawberries and mango's for their juices and that left a pretty horrible taste in our mouths.

We took 4-5 bites a piece, because we were starving and threw the rest away.  And if you know us, you know that we NEVER throw food away.  We always take our leftovers home.  Not this time.  Wish we had put the calories toward something actually satisfying like In-N-Out. 

Sorry AZ Frybread."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good frybread place and found this great location. I had the bean and cheese w/ sour cream."}
{"text":"Very good been looking for a good place for fry bread and I believe I've found one. Service was great very clean and comfortable. Would definitely recommend it. Just don't come to late. I was unfortunate and missed out on the green Chile."}
{"text":"Zero stars.


As someone who has eaten fry bread their whole lives made by actual Natives.

This place bar far is the absolute worst.  I've never actually spent frybread but this was disgusting and the staff was very rude."}
{"text":"Sigh!
I'm trying to call this \"Store Number for Arizona Frybread\" for 6 times to be exact.
On my first call I'm trying to make an inquiry and the owner itself just shout at me over the phone.

Second call tried again and still they hang up on me.

Really? Are you chinese or spanish that you cannot understand the word \"Hello, I would like to make an inquiry\".
I'm calling this store because next weekend we will be in Arizona.

Third to Sixth time calling they hang up the phone.

That's how you treat your customers right?

Very sad!"}
{"text":"Cashier gave us A plus service. Very warm and sincere greeting etc. my husband liked this place but I was a little disappointed.  I got the chicken Arizona. Presentation was great and looked delicious.  I know it's FRY bread but found it way overly greasy.  Instead if a light fluffy bread it seemed heavy and greasy.  I felt like a teaspoon of oil was released into my mouth as I chewed each bite and I couldn't finish more than a couple of bites.  I tasted my hubby's and his was just as greasy. I also felt that for the price they were skimpy on the meat. I think there were two bites of chicken on my serving.   I'm really hoping I just got an unlucky serving because I was truly impressed with the service for this type of place and want locally owned places to thrive. I would have given 2 stars but the third was for service."}
{"text":"Place is very clean, kitchen looks spotless. The fry bread is the best ive had its better then the fair and the restaurant i been to. Great place to get fry bread."}
{"text":"The bread is amazing! But the chicken is prepackaged and frozen, tastes awful."}
{"text":"The hours of operation listed on the door state 8pm closure. Arrived at 645pm and the whole place was closed. Unprofessional and inaccurate."}
{"text":"Great customer service forgot something in my order but knew I was walking so they brought it to me"}
{"text":"Bad food, not so great service... I will definitely not be going back to this restaurant! The location is clean but the food was no where close to what you would expect. I ordered the Mojito Chicken and could not find one piece of chicken on it and it did not taste good. Plus the guy working there seemed like he didn't want to be bothered so that added more negativity to the experience. Do yourself a favor and go to Fry Bread House off of Indian School! It's delicious and better priced than this place. Well worth the drive..."}
{"text":"A frybread place in Avondale. Not native owned or made. Just ok. Again people, cumin has no place in green chile. If you have to add it, then your chile has no flavor and needs to be replaced with authentic New Mexican chile. Their red chile has no heat. Calabacita soup? (needed salt and chile) 
So, nice try but meh."}
{"text":"I only give it 3 stars instead of 4. Its very good but, not enough meat in any of the fry bread. It was like i had a veggie fry bread and i had about 3 or 4 servings of chicken.  Bread needs to be a tad more on the crispy side. Also they need to drain the oil off the bread better.  More meat guys on your bread!"}
{"text":"Never open when they say they are going to be.  Done with the inconsistent times. Maria's Fry bread it is."}
{"text":"Extremely tasty fry bread and very friendly customer service. The green chili carne was spicy goodness. If you like spicy, give this one a try. You won't regret it. Also must save room for the cinnamon sugar fry bread sticks for dessert."}
{"text":"Just got back from this place. It's next to Del Taco in Avondale and easy to miss. 

35.00 for 3 fry bread platters and chips, not the cheapest, but not the most expensive either. 

My wife had the steak & potato fry bread, which was LOADED with meat and fixins' and she loved every bite of it! 

Daughter had a lemony, zesty, chicken fry bread, that was amazing! The lemon and the cream was great together! 

I had the con carne, it was pretty darn good! It should have came with lettuce & other toppings, like the others, but to be fair, he warned me ahead of time that it was bread & chili. However, it was mad flavorful, and worth the trip. 

Best Part for me? Cinnamon iced tea! Yeah buddy! 

Big and clean on the inside, and the staff were generous, friendly, and talkative."}
{"text":"I think that a lot of people come here expecting Navajo fry bread but this is Mexican fry bread. Crisco vs oil makes a huge difference. As long as you know what you're getting, you won't be disappointed:)"}
{"text":"I had a bad feeling when I went there today, the location is bad, very end of Avondale downtown, nasty place.  I had Mojito chicken frybread and I was expecting something better than Taco Bell's Chalupa but I'm disappointed. Frybread was good but they didn't give me enough chiken and cheese and lettuce was old. I wasted my money. I feel like I'm gonna have a diarrhea today."}
{"text":"I love frybread. It's been awhile since we'd eaten here because whenever we think of it, they're not open! (They are closed on Monday and by 8pm Tuesday-Friday.) But we made it back. I got the Frybread \"Lil Vincie\" which has meat & potatoes and cheese. I wanted it without the pico but was told that it is premixed, so I knew I'd have some onions and things to pick out. They were busy and we grabbed the last table. It takes some time for the food to come out, but it's so good. I really liked the meat & potatoes. We also got the dessert sampler (powdered sugar, cinnamon brown sugar, powdered sugar & honey, and honey). It was so tasty. Yummy frybread!"}
{"text":"Finally came and they were open (they are never open when are listed as). Ordered a lunch special to go and was told it was dune in only. Nowhere on their website or menu does it say that. So I did a to do bean and cheese. Got charged an additional .75 cents for using a debit card. Took almost 20 mins for a simple order. Staff seemed annoyed to be there. Then one mopped the floor and the mop smelled so bad it made me nauseous. All this for mediocre fried bread. I'll just have to go out of way to downtown next time I want fried bread."}
{"text":"Tried it out this past weekend. I'm not a huge fan of frybread but everything was tasty and fresh. The location has been turned over several times in the last couple years and I don't know if this place will have better luck or not. Nice, helpful staff."}
{"text":"Where do I even start with this one...

First off, let me say that the staff was friendly and welcoming.  And that was where the positive experience ended.

My girlfriend and I stopped in here on a Saturday on the way to a friend's house because we were looking for a quick bite and this place had good reviews.  I love good frybread so I was excited to see what this place had to offer.  I was sadly disappointed.

I tried the Dev's chicken dish and my girlfriend tried another dish that I can't recall the name of.  I really can't believe that what came out was the standard that this place goes by.  The frybread itself wasn't bad but was pretty bland.  The rest of the stuff on top was even more bland than the frybread.  There were way too many refried beans on this thing and I think I got half of a head of lettuce on top of that.  I think there was chicken buried in there somewhere but it sure didn't taste like it.  There was absolutely no flavor to this thing which is impressive because the ingredients should have come together nicely (should have...but didn't).  I even tried to spice it up with the hot sauce they gave us and that had no flavor either.  My girlfriend didn't fare any better as her meal looked and tasted like a full can of refried beans and the other half of the head of lettuce that ended up on mine.

Shortly after we had begun eating some guy came out from the kitchen and asked if everything was ok.  The way he asked it though indicated that he was trying to see if he had made it correctly rather than simply seeing if we were enjoying the meal.  It was so awful that I simply didn't have the heart to tell the kid that it was some of the worst food I have ever had.

Please understand that I do not consider myself a food snob or anything like that.  This meal simply was poorly done and had zero taste to it.  I got through half of it and had to throw the rest away...and I hadn't eaten anything else all day so I was really hungry.  I also tried one of their house juice drinks that they had available.  The peach-melon sounded tasty.  It wasn't.  It tasted like drinking cantaloupe juice.

If you are a frybread company then you should at least do the frybread really well and then build on top of that.  This place just didn't have it together I'm afraid."}
{"text":"Yuck!  We have never had frybread and made 4 trips to this place before we found it open. We ordered the Arizona, frybread, beans, cheese, ground beef, lettuce, tomato and sour cream sauce.  Sounded very similar to tacos we make at home.  The frybread was very greasy and tasted like it was cooked in old grease.  The beans were sour and the hamburger was almost non existent, lots of lettuce.  We also had 2 sodas.  The total for this un-edible mess $22 and change.  We took a few bites and threw our meals in the trash. The guy who waited on us was rude and impatient and we were never asked if everything was ok, he could have cared less that we were there. We will not be back! I can honestly say this is the first time I have ever went anywhere, threw the food away and went somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"Best in the area.  All the variations were tasty! red chile, arizona, and chicken mojito.  Favorite is plain w honey."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on our way back from Las Vegas. I like how the fry bread is cooked to order. The green and red chili were both good. The fry bread was not overly greasy like other places. I questioned stopping in after reading other reviews but decided to give it a try. Not a bad choice for something quick."}
{"text":"The fry bread was decent.  The toppings were really weird though.  She said the green chile came with beans but i think they were over boiled refried beans as there were no whole beans in tact. I think it came with this gelatinous meat but i wasn't sure.  Would not recommend eating here unless they revamped their ingredients.  

It was just a soggy mess."}
{"text":"So this \"fry bread\" (ormaybeit'sjustoneword -- \"frybread\"... or-maybe-it-is fry-bread?) is something completely new to me.  Basically, they take the same soft and fluffy fry bread and add different toppings to them. 

I tried a handful of different fry breads... there was the Mia's special (unfortunately, the chicken and other toppings on this one tasted kind of gross)... a refried bean option (which wasn't too bad since I'm not really a fan of refried beans)... and a couple different fry breads that had ground beef on them (these were delicious and were my favorites by far).

I also ordered a combo of dessert fry breads -- the strawberry and caramel were decent, but the chocolate and cherry were just ok.  I would have liked to see some actual fresh fruits on the dessert fry breads... and maybe even some whipped cream or a little powdered sugar.  

Overall, I think they are definitely on to something here and could really do well with a few minor changes in their menu.  I would definitely go back and try this place again... so if you're in the mood for some fry bread, frybread, or fry-bread, then go ahead and give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice now and both times have just been okay. The service is pretty good the employee was friendly both times I went. (Only one person working) The food however, just okay. Both times I went when I got my meal it wasn't hot. It was just a little bit warm. To me fry bread is something that should be served as hot as possible. Secondly it's kind of pricey considering they are pretty skimpy on the toppings. And both times I went, there were no other customers. Not sure if I'd go back a third time."}
{"text":"Extremely unaccommodating! We were scolded for adding one extra chair to a big round table. The entire staff was not welcoming. Our family of 12 more than doubled their business so you'd think they want us there.  I was not allowed to drink from my own water bottle while in their restaurant. I've never experienced anything like this. We were very uncomfortable there. We asked if they could turn down the TV. They didn't, so we did. BUT then they blasted the radio.  So if you want a bad atmosphere, BLAND OVERPRICED  food and RUDE people, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing there mojito chicken was amazing and had fast friendly service"}
{"text":"I didn't get to try it because my boyfriend and I drove out here only to find a handwritten \"closed\" sign on the door.  Disappointed, hungry, and upset"}
{"text":"We were so excited to try a fry bread place near us. 

This was the biggest waste of $27 I have ever spent. The fry bread was dry and tasted like old oil, and the the overall taste didn't make us very excited to finish the meal. 
The part I'm mostly upset about is the \"kids meals\" they were so small and sad that my kids were asking where their actual dinner was (which I now have to make after spending all that money). It was a few small pieces of bread and a tiny dollop of beans to dip. This is something I would feed a kid in a high chair as far as the amount goes, then they got to fight over who got the Capri sun and who got the kool aid pouch... not something I expected to get from a restaurant, we have those at home. 

The service was okay, the front girl was nice. She was the only one there, so she was both on register and cook.  (I thought it was closed when I walked in at 6pm, not a soul in sight) 
I mean, I can get over small portions, and even high prices... but not when you get both and the food is just terrible on top of it. 
I don't even want my food replaced, just a refund honestly. That was awful."}
{"text":"Delicious & fresh frybread!  Plenty of parking. Eat in, or dine out. Family owned. Been in location since April 2011. Not the best location, but most \"hole in the wall\" joints are authentic and real! Will visit again."}
{"text":"I came here a few days ago with the wife. We had gone to them when they were in Buckeye and it WAS awesome. Our experience this time was less than stellar.  The dough tasted like play-dough....salty as hell, undercooked and kinda slimy/sludgy in the middle.The toppings (wife had cinnamon and I had green chili chicken) and the mild salsa were the only reasons I could eat a few bites. I ended up scraping it off and throwing out the fry bread. The price was about avg but still not worth the taste. I dont think we will try it again. Sad day."}
