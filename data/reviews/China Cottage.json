{"text":"Came in last night to take my in laws for dinner. We ordered the chicken and shrimp pakora, chicken fried rice and chicken 88. I have been the to markham location numerous times and it has been fine. However, coming here we requested the food to be spicy and the server told us it would be an extra charge for ever item ordered. This blew my mind! How are you going to charge me to make my dish mild or spicy!!! After that the food came out. The chicken pakora was disgusting and not fully cooked. When I cut into it you could see it was not well done and when I pointed it out the same server said its an extra charge. He was an older guy. The food was bland and horrible and they just try to steal all your money. Never coming back ever!"}
{"text":"Consistently great hakka food - love the hakka squid, manchurian chicken, and cottage special chicken appetizer."}
{"text":"My girlfriend introduced me to China Cottage 3 years ago, and it's now my favourite Hakka restaurant in Toronto. Great, spicy dishes with great taste while being well priced. Peppered Chicken and Chili Chicken are my favourites, but if you don't like spice their mixed Cantonese Chow Mein (Shrimp / Chicken) is great. Overall, great for take out or eat in."}
{"text":"I had their tom yum soup and it was not good. One of the things I love about this soup is the colour but the colour on this one was runny and had no eye appeal, and the same goes for the flavour. It had no flavour and tasted watered down, and had a foul metal like smell. Not pleased at all. I bought the large shrimp one at $10 and had to throw it out after one spoonful.   The crispy beef was pretty good but I expected a greater portion size."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this place to me. Myself and one other person went for dinner two weeks ago, and it was not worth a penny we paid.   To start off, our food came about five minutes after we ordered (literally), which seemed odd.. I mean, fast service is great, but is it really a good sign when you order three dishes and they arrive within 5 minutes?   I chose the shrimp chow mein dish, which was nothing close to shrimp chow mein. I don't even think there was shrimp in it. They used the wrong noodles, and the wrong sauce. It was basically a whole other dish.  The person whom I was with ordered the pad Thai. Worst pad Thai ever. Seriously it was so bad we didn't want to eat it.   The third dish we ordered was black bean beef. When they brought it to us, we found a long, curly black hair in it, which was disgusting, and when we told the waitress, she took it to the back and brought it right back out to us. Same dish... just removed the hair. We obviously did not eat it.  I don't know about their other varieties of food, but if you want good Thai food or chow mein, do not go to China Cottage"}
{"text":"China Cottage is a quaint little space, with a nice decor and mediocre food.  I went for lunch, and to be fair, the $6.25 lunch special is a lot of food, and it's definitely edible, hard to demand high-quality for 6 bucks.  The wait staff was quiet and quick, and I had my chili chicken in an almost scary-short time.  The lunch specials come with either a pop, a spring roll or hot and sour soup.  The soup was somewhat bland and could have been simmered longer, but the broth had good consistency.   The chicken was a little better quality than Lin, but the sauce wasn't as thick or spicy, and didn't have nearly enough garlic.  It is a decent, cheap option for Hakka lunch in the area."}
{"text":"For hakka food lovers this is a must visit place. I have never dined in (just take out).food is same quality every single time. I recommend chillie chicken and sweet &sour chicken."}
{"text":"Ofcourse not the most healthy place to eat food, but damb, the food is tasty.  The place is in a small strip with very tight parking and you really can't find parking nect to the restaurant during lunch or dinner.  The staff is courteous too and treats the customers with respect."}
{"text":"Read all the great reviews and decided to try it out. Was very disappointed. The worst Hakka food I have ever had. Not sure what it is about this place that others love.   We had to chicken and shrimp 88. It tasted like over seasoned tandoori. The shrimp pakora was a joke. Deep fried battered shrimp with no chilli or spice. Chilli chicken was decent but I've had much better.   Will not be going back.   We will stick with spicy dragon when we want Hakka."}
{"text":"We (only two people) were sitting at our table for about thirty minutes and our waiter didn't even take our order yet. Eventually, we just walked out. There were many waiters there and it wasn't even busy - there was no excuse for the lack of service. Very disappointed with the service and we were really looking forward to eat their food too."}
{"text":"Came in last Friday night for some takeout.  Restaurant was totally packed even at 10:00 pm.  Ordered the \"chilli chicken\".  Great dish, which came with white rice.  Just the amount of spice I like.  Portion sizes are pretty large, so I was quite full afterwards.  Paid just over $10 in total, which was awesome considering the portion size.  I will be back."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of Hakka,the is one of the best place around. When you enter the restaurant you may feel bit congested,but still you can have a happy stay.  When it comes to the food you can expect a genuinely good hakka. Chicken 88 and chilly chicken were amazing.The service was good and fast. And you get surprisingly large quantities for what you pay."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!   Chicken 88 or Mumbai chicken are simply amazing.  I'm not veg. But I love their spicy pepper tofu. You gotta try it!  I have been going here for 8 years now."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best Hakka places in town. I recommend the pepper chicken, Hakka eggplant extra crispy, and chicken 88."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price! If you are a fan of hakka food (Chinese/Indian fusion) or want to try it out for the first time this is the place to go. The portions are huge and their lunch specials are a great value and there's a huge selection to choose from."}
{"text":"- More like a 3.5 star -  Came in on a Sunday afternoon and we were seated immediately.  Wasn't too busy but there was a steady flow of diners - good sign.  The interior was nothing special, but it was clean - and we're off to a good start!   Tried the chilli chicken, rice, lime soda (not happening again), some \"soup\" that was really more like sauce considering the consistency and saltiness, and some other items I don't even remember anymore - I think one was a yellow noodle dish, but I'll most definitely come back for the fried fish!! Bite sized portions, perfect amount of crunchiness and spice to keep you wanting more. Think fish and chips after an Asian-style makeover? It was good ok!  The service was great. Very attentive servers who came around to clear empty plates and make sure we had everything we needed.  Considering there aren't very many decent restaurants in this area, this place is definitely worth another visit! I would come back - for the fried fish."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and reasonably priced.  Service was fast, friendly and very courteous.  Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"CHICKEN 88!  thats all have to say. My all-time favourite lunch item.   This place makes fabulous food!!!"}
{"text":"Service is terrible. Had to wait 40 min before being served. And then another 30 for the food. In fact I'm actually writing this review before eating the food. Havnt tried the food yet, but all I can say is stay away if you value your time"}
{"text":"Good food , comes fast workers are nice just one time I went there the food wasn't all that but I still love it great place! And try the Hakka fish very good"}
{"text":"Never a hit or miss situation. Unlike other scarcity staples like Tangerine and Fredericks, I find that China Cottage does Hakka cuisine very nice.  The decor is def a step up from the usual hustle and bustle of generic restaurants.   The best menu items   Hakka Fish -- the best in Tdot hands down   Manchurain Veg Noodles -- thick noodles, loads of veggies and a nice spicy kick   Ginger Beef; -- get it dry and it tastes real nice on rice with a few chillis  aything 88 -- we usually do the shrimp 88 -- fragrant, spicy and full of flavour.   All in all certain hakka joints are know for certain items, but china cottage has yet to dissappoint.   Will keep coming back here always!   Ohhh and the drinks are uber cheap as well."}
{"text":"I'm updating this to a solid 5 as a result of my experience here today.   We really couldn't decide what to order; we explained our criteria to the waiter, and he gave us numerous different options, explaining each one.   At the end of our meal, I asked for the rest of the food to be packed up for take-out. After paying my bill, I had actually forgotten my take-out inside the restaurant, and I was outside getting into my car. The waiter actually came out in the pouring rain to give me the food I had forgotten inside, which I really wouldn't expect anyone to do. This is the main reason I'm giving this place a 5; the service is great, they really do care about their customers."}
{"text":"this place always gives me cravings and the food is delicious! all the \"spicy\" dishes i got weren't actually spicy (bit disappointing) but tasted great nonetheless. place is great for quick takeout.. although the food gets made questionably fast"}
{"text":"I have no idea what China and Cottages have to do with Hakka food, but I liked it! I would've never went to this place if it wasn't for a friend who recommended this. Really good value lunch specials, service was prompt and timely. Would recommend and go back."}
{"text":"Well, I guess you get what you pay for. I had the lunch special of the chicken teriyaki chicken and egg roll. It was pretty cheap and so was the taste, although the quantity was good, quality not so much. I'm sure there are some dishes which maybe good, but for me, I didn't find one.  So I wouldn't mind giving it another shot, but maybe I should anticipate not being blown away by the food"}
{"text":"We visited them today to grab a quick dinner. The food was very mediocre. I had chili fish and wife had American chop suey. The gravy in the dishes was very much watered down and flavorless. Even the sauce kept on the table was diluted. The quantity was decent for the price, though. The service was okay. It's hardly been an hour since we returned; both I and my wife got diarrhea. Never going back there again."}
{"text":"Don't let this dimly-lit small corner restaurant fool you. It's a bit over decorated with Indian and Chinese trinkets, assumingly to give a Chinese-hakka feel, but the food is good/great for cheap. I got a lunch special chicken 88, rice with hot and sour soup all for $7! A generous portion of well seasoned crispy chicken with a decent hot and sour soup has made me a repeat customer. If you're looking for a quick Asian bite to eat at a ridiculous cheap price without the cheap quality, check this place out."}
{"text":"A great option to try hakka chinese since its halal! We had cantonese chow mein, chicken 88 and spicy fish with vegetable stir fry rice and that was all enough for four people to eat! Beware, their portion sizes are huge and that will be your only complaint! For those that like mild spices though, you will have to ask them to keep it mild!"}
{"text":"Friend's family recommended this nearby place as a good local restaurant. Perhaps it was late but my party of seven gave them a visit on Saturday night near their kitchen closing time.  Knowing their food was supposed to be Hakka, their menu also indicated a Thai food section and a lot of other dishes. Moreover, their food seemed to be everywhere - no real signature dish or type. In the end, I ordered my own dish of Pad Thai with chicken and shrimp, and tried a bit of my friend's butter chicken (non-spicy).  I was really disappointed and so were my friends. I am really unsure why this place even has a 3.5 stars. Neither dishes were made at par. The butter chicken looked really saucy and bright orange, but it literally almost tasted bland as if the sauce was diluted with water - meat without flavour. Although my friend requested the butter chicken to not be spicy, it still shouldn't have tasted like that at all! As for my own Pad Thai, the noodles used weren't the norm for Pad Thai - they were thick and a bit weird. Likewise, there was not much Thai taste and aroma going into this dish. You can also taste the lack of peanut and fish sauce added. It was quite a disaster.  I'm glad the service was at least mediocre. They were kind to inform us of when their kitchen was closing and if we had any more orders to request. They also made sure no one was allergic to peanuts. However, we asked to doggy bag our food but the waiter forgot about it until he asked us again after everyone had paid for their food.  Their environment and interior restaurant decor was nice, making the restaurant look authentic. Except.. the food was really not very good. Based on my experience, I don't think I will visit them again."}
{"text":"This has been my go to hakka place for a decade now. I do prefer Fredericks for certain dishes but I have a loyalty to China cottage that I can't break.   The lunch specials here are great for 6.95$ lots of options including vegetarian. The dry chilli chicken and chicken 88 has always been a favourite.   The place is much nicer ever since they had to renovate after the fire in the plaza. If you're in the area do drop by for some hakka goodness"}
{"text":"Came here with coworkers for lunch. We split the chicken 88 and the crispy eggplant. Both were delicious. They had some good lunch specials too so will definitely have to come back and give those a try."}
{"text":"Not bad i like the setup of the place the staff is friendly the Hakka chicken is good along with the rice and noodles. Better then your typical deep fried grease stuff. szechuan beef is really good here but the hakka chicken takes it!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant if you like hakka food. My go-to is chicken 88. My friend said chili chicken (dry) is really good too!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Lollipop chicken was over cooked  Chilli chicken was meh Shrimp pokora was good  Fried rice was fresh  Veggie pad Thai was good   Clean place   I don't like places with huge menus..."}
{"text":"I ordered chilli chicken, rice and special chicken and chicken corn soup for starter. The rice was awful. The chilli chicken wasn't spicy enough for me. The soup had very little taste. The service was good."}
{"text":"China cottage never disappoints. Great, fast service, delicious selections, generous portions and fresh food. Get there early as lunch and dinner get very busy.   On this visit, we had their cashew chicken good, but not great, chicken 88, decent amount of spice, but too over bearing, and their house speciality, chilli chicken, which we all loved! Other favourites include their spicy mango salad, Hakka noodles and Hakka vegetables.  Take out is also available if you want to eat at home. I'll be back and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I come here quite often to get some good quality take out food. The food here is always good and super fresh. They have some great vege options, and some of the best paneer I've had in the GTA. The quantity and prices are great, you get a huge amount of food for such little costs.   The only reason I wouldn't rate it a 5 is because the server who spoke to me yelled at me for changing my order. All the other servers were nice, but that one scared me.   The feel of the place is quite small and tight. Its a good place to go if you have alot of people and want to share dishes."}
{"text":"A nice place to go for lunch and get deep fried meat in sweet sauce if you're in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.  China Cottage is a nice enough restaurant set in a somewhat anonymous strip mall. The decor is pleasant and clean. The service was solid, if not exceptional. We had crispy beef, manchurian chicken, lollipop chicken, mixed cantonese chow mein and lung fung soup.   The crispy beef was deep fried and served in a thick sweet sauce. The manchurian chicken was deep fried and served in a thick sweet sauce. The lollipop chicken was fried and served with a thick sweet plum sauce (or something like it, anyway). The chow mein noodles were thicker than average and the sauce was the sort of thickened clear sauce that's common on chow mein. The lung fung soup was minced bits of chicken, shrimp and vegetables, maybe some egg, in a thickened broth.  They were all decent, but they all reminded me of the westernized chinese food of my childhood, where most meat is deep fried and covered in a thick sweetened sauce. My favorite was probably the lollipop chicken, which was essentially chicken wings with plumb sauce, but it was still tasty.  I didn't dislike anything that I had there, and in fact, if was above average for this kind of food. But there are lots of places to get food that feels a little less westernized that I like better that are closer to me than China Cottage, so I'm not likely to go back.  They seemed to have a pretty long menu of vegetarian items, although we didn't have any vegetarians with us. The portions were all generous."}
{"text":"Not the best hakka in Toronto. Got take-out when we randomly saw it. The food is cheap but I wanted more flavor. Ordered chilli beef, the beef was tender but lacked seasoning. The General Tso Chicken was good but we wished there was more quantity. The Manchurian fried rice was the best, nice flavor and good quantity.  All in all, food just ok, nothing exciting. Will stick to Danforth Dragon for some good Hakka."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Hakka places in the world. I cant help but order a whole bunch of items since everything is so good. Appatizers : LOLLIPOP CHICKEN and GARLIC SHRIMP, So good. I also order Chicken 88 for my dry item and Sa Po chicken , since the sauce is soo good and amazing with plain rice. Plus the waiters speak bengali, my native tongue. Definitely a plus. I go to many hakka places. This is one of the top ones."}
{"text":"Good value for lunch. Good was pretty bland, needs fresher ingredients and spicy zing. Chilli chicken was ok. Seated quickly and served fast.   They have to work on the food quality."}
{"text":"Impressed by the Hakka noodles.  Perfect mix of flavor and spice.  Service was quick."}
{"text":"Had take out... The person who answered the phone was very efficient and precise about time (when the food would be ready and how much it would cost). If you pay cash you do get a 10% discount on take-out food only. When you walk into the restaurant, it looks very clean and well kept. The person at the desk said they've been there for fifteen years. Very impressive.  Customer service was great. He checked our order twice to make sure everything was there. We had chicken pakora, Mumbai fried rice, mixed vegetables and golden fried shrimp. All taste amazing. We even had an extra steam rice (for free) I guess. Pakora and rice nicely spiced (fair amount of heat). My only suggestion: add sauce for pakora (too dry to eat alone) and for the shrimp (like plum sauce).  Would I go again? Yes... For sure will be try a dine in experience. Will definitely try the chilli  chicken as I heard it's something not to miss!"}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews, but decided to write one for china cottage because this place never disappoints. Now I say avoid the Chinese Indian safe choices like sweet and sour chicken and chicken with veggies. Just because you'll be missing out on of the restaurants gems. Hakka squid and chicken 88. I was a little skeptical when my cousin ordered it for me but when he did I was soo happy. I HIGHLY recommend those dishes. Large quantities for a fair price this place is a Scarborough jewel."}
{"text":"This will always be our favourite indian/Chinese restaurant.   We cannot get enough of the Chili Chicken and the Hakka rice.  I started coming to this restaurant 15 years ago and have witnessed a few renos.   Service is friendly and quick.  A few years ago they opened a new location at Markham Road and Steeles which we have yet to visit but hope to soon.   China Cottage never disappoints!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for over 6 years.  My last few trips however, resulted in me, friends, and family getting food poisoning.  The way they cook their food is very unsanitary and it includes cooking all the dishes in the same vessel without cleaning them.  If you have allergies or other issues, they cannot guarantee you are safe for these same reasons.  The service has also become worse, with servers being rude and anxious to take your order.  The food, for what its worth used to be great, now its no longer as good.  I would avoid this place.   I would take a good look at Fredricks, Lin Garden, and China Garden as great alternatives."}
{"text":"ordered take out today .. call taker got the order wrong .. I ordered a side if chilli chicken gravy and got an order of chilli chicken with extra gravy .. I m all for employing foreigners but they should at least be capable of doing the job .. too bad"}
{"text":"Really good service and clean place.  The food is a little bland and perhaps could get anywhere in T.O.  I would definately give service a 10*."}
{"text":"This place is ALWAYS busy - dining in and take out.  It's a hakka place where the portions are large and the food is great!  I love the hakka fish, shrimp fried rice, sweet/sour soup, beef with black bean sauce...and well a whole host of other dishes.  The menu is pretty extensive...it can be overwhelming and the dishes are definitely share platters.  You will have tons of food if you order 3-4 items for 4 people.    Also, for most dishes they do party sizes ordering out (1/2 tray or full try) but I believe you might have to order a day ahead - not 100% sure - just call them and ask.  The service is great - everyone has always been friendly and efficient.  The food comes out pretty fast and always tastes hot and fresh  A great place to get a meal for under $20"}
{"text":"First time trying hakka and I enjoyed it. All the dishes had a bit of heat but not too much. Ordered the hot and sour soup which was flavourful and one of the best I've tried. Their chef special shrimp was to die for. The spicy crispy beef was good but nothing out of this world. The Manchurian chicken was delish. They give you a large bowl of steamed rice which is a nice surprise compared tooyher places where you have to pay for a tiny bowl. Only downside was we went on a cold chilly day and the entire restaurant was freezing because of the steady flow of people coming in and out.  Staff was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Asian restaurants I've been to.  Their specialty is Haka and boy, is it good.  Their sauces are the best part of all the meals.  It doesn't really matter what the protein is, it's all very good.  So far, there has only been one occasion where we order take-away and one of the dishes wasn't saucy enough.   Check it out! It's extremely good."}
{"text":"Chili Chicken, Chili Chicken Chili Chicken.  I love this place!  Anytime I'm in Toronto I MUST have their Chili Chicken and my hubby MUST have ... get ready... Chili Chicken without chili....yes I said without the chili.  Trust me they are both awesome dishes.  Love it Love it Love it."}
{"text":"Lin Garden is better. It's around the same area and if you want hakka, just skip the Cottage.  I give this place one star for fish pakoras and one star for their lovely decor. It's much much much more pleasant than Lin...Other than that it was bleh.  First of all, it's too expensive for Hakka, in my opinion. Garlic chicken, manchurian noodles and fish pakoras cost me $30 bucks. WTF.  Manchurian noodles were not right. They were kind of hard, barely any chicken - a couple random tiny pieces here and there. Not spicy AT ALL. And they weren't red...why?   Garlic chicken, where is the garlic? Zero spice. Zero garlic. Mushy and not that good.  Fish pakoras - respect. But again, very very mild in terms of spice.They were just pieces of which fish, not in a ball like the ones at Lin. I like Lin's MUCH MUCH more."}
{"text":"I love this place, awesome chili chicken.  Also, try their fried banana dessert, fantastic!  Staff are friendly and good service is quick.  Recommend! :)"}
{"text":"Went here with a group and was very impressed.  Chili chicken was excellent as was the spicy fried hakka fish.  Other dishes were very good too.  Some hakka offerings that were not familiar to me so I want to go back and try them next time.  Friendly service.  Simple atmosphere and the place is not large but it can accommodate groups of up to about ten or so.  Very reasonable prices and portions were huge.  Long menu includes Thai food as well but I think the Hakka food is the reason to come.   Parking lot for the strip mall in which they are located is a bit small."}
{"text":"My favorite place to come for Indo-Chinese in North York/ Scarborough area. Reasonably priced and good service. The staff is attentive and polite. And of course the food is pretty darn good as well!"}
{"text":"Hakka isn't my favourite food I have to say but stopping in for lunch I have no complaints at all about the China Cottage. The meal was well prepared although less spicy than I expected (I had the chilli chicken) and the service was brisk and friendly.  Great value at $6:50 for the meal which came with a choice of soup, egg roll or pop."}
{"text":"This place is no looker, and the service isn't what people come for (that's not to say it's bad, but it's not great). But, it is a great hakka place!  Note: everything here is fried...which I love, but not all do. We ordered the house special chicken, which was like chicken pakoras (they were super hot, still juicy on the inside and well spiced), the spicy tofu (this was great, would definitely recommend this! super flavourful...just yum), the spicy fish (see tofu comment...get this one too!), and the green mango salad (this actually was closer to a mango salad than a green mango salad, which was super delicious...it had nuts, some coriander, riper than green, sprinkled with a little sugar...more dessert adjacent). The whole meal comes with ride too!  And because it's in the suburbs, it's much closer to suburb prices for portions :D."}
{"text":"I haven't had a lot of hakka food in the city but so far this is my favorite place. I ordered take out and glad I did because when I was there to pick up the food, the restaurant was packed. Prices are good and portions are generous.   We ordered the chili chicken (dry), masala beef, hakka noodles and hakka eggplant and all were excellent. It was hard to pick though because there are so many choices on their menu.   I know I'll be going back here for my next hakka craving."}
{"text":"I was addicted to their food for 2 years! Any time my friends wanted to eat out, I would only want to go to this restaurant! This restaurant has the best Hakka ( Indo- Chinese) cuisine in Toronto! They have a few unique dishes exclusive to their restaurant, and they are a must try in my opinion !  My unique favorites:  Cottage special soup Szechuan soup Hakka fish Shrimp 88 Chicken 88  All the standard Hakka dishes are very good as well! I often order American chop suey along with the Manchurian, Szechuan and chili dishes I love the large portion of food as well! The staff is friendly and accommodating , because they are often very busy.   Also for vegetarian folks, their Hakka vegetable dishes a very flavorful."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Bf and I come here so often they know us and our order- Chili chicken dry and fish w mixed veggies! Very friendly, super fast, very affordable. We always leave super full and our bill comes to less than 20 bucks for both of us! Visit this place when you're in the area you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"It is a so so food. Means every time go and you order the same food it will taste different than the first time... one time salty, one spicy, over cooked etc....  I like it but I wish they can keep some standard!!!.."}
{"text":"One of my favourite halal restaurants! I highly recommend the Pepper Chicken, Crispy Ginger Beef, and Three Meat Shanghai Noodles. I've never been disappointed with China Cottage and it's great for family dinners."}
{"text":"China Cottage is nestled on the corner of a small strip mall across from Parkway Mall. Seems like a hot spot for take-out. As for sit-in, mostly Indian families or high school friends or couples on cheap dates. We came here on a Wednesday night after playing badminton up at Richmond Hill.  The interior looks decently decorated, but is still pretty dark and gloomy. As for the menu, the prices for the main dishes range from $7-12 and are sorted according to the type of meat or lack thereof (i.e. chicken, shrimp, beef, vegetarian). While there are a number of soups listed under 'vegetarian', the waiter that served us confirmed that they did indeed have fish sauce.  We ended up starting with two spring rolls ($1.25 each) which large and of the frozen variety, accompanied by sweet plum sauce. We ordered two mains - Thai basil eggplant, which came with an enormous bowl of tough, dry rice, and Manchurian Hakka noodles.  The latter dish came with slices of green pepper and a few spears of broccoli. They were mildly spicy and, not surprisingly, heavily salted. As for the Thai basil, it came in a heavy, sticky and starchy sauce, overpowering any flavour of basil; the eggplant itself was overcooked. There were no other vegetables, except some raw chopped green onions garnished on top.  The place is fine if you're on a strict budget and want to split dishes with gigantic portions when out with a group of buddies, but in my books, but this is a restaurant that's not worth revisiting. At least Tangerine Asian Cuisine, also on Ellesmere, in east-end Scarborough offers better choices.   Still have yet to find a decent Hakka restaurant. My mom and I are starting to think that such a thing doesn't exist."}
{"text":"Got the garlic and Manchurian chicken, there was very little taste difference it all tasted the same. The portions were smaller. I got robbed from this place as well someone pick pocketed my 20 the staff did not assist me. They kept circling us as well thinking we are criminals. They said I called chicken lollipop wrong but the second guy said it lollipop chicken like I did. Also they claim this place is hallal but they serve many different alcoholic beverages. No after dinner complimentaries, not even fortune cookies very disappointing."}
{"text":"Horrible! Seriously what the hell people sell on the name on Hakka ???  The food with colours, either or sugar - and that they call food? worst experience ever. The tasteless, stale food.  I n my husband both got sick, within 30 mins from leaving there, I would say it was difficult to even to reach home,  diarrhea attack happened :( I ordered Veggie American Chop Suey, and he did some fish, We did not share, which makes sure that both dishes were not suitable for your tummy and your tongue :P I had just 2-3 bites and left the place. For the price, you would feel the quantity is good, but it does not matter when you can't even have 10% of it. It's that bad. Service was good tough.  Definitely, would never recommend and never going back!"}
{"text":"Another delicious experience. Has never disappointed me yet. Been going there for over a year now. The staff remembers you and treats you like family. Definitely recommend this place for the best Hakka food in the 6ix!"}
{"text":"- IMO one of the best Hakka spots around - The decor might put you off when you enter, just remember you're there for the food - Portions are generous and the price comparatively low - Items to definitely order : Chicken 88, Chilli Chicken (dry), Hakka fish - Service has always been great at this place. Fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Excellent food, very good quality. The service and speed of delivery of food is amazing, no other halal Chinese like it. Food comes within 5-7 mins of ordering. Service provided by Nirav (sp?) is excellent. He shows passion and enthusiasm for his job which I find refreshing and is generally lacking in small halal restaurants like this. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"My sister, boyfriend, and I went here on Sunday being really hungry after a cardio workout. My sister ordered a small bowl of crab and corn soup. She appreciated it, given that it is her favorite soup. My boyfriend and I had the Yang chow fried rice and manchurian chicken.  We were disappointed as fck. It was mediocre.   I am sure that anyone who is extremely hungry would have anything on his/ her mouth taste delicious but their dishes were blant.   The interior of the restaurant was a 4/5. The food though was really disappointing.   I wasn't happy. I am not coming back. Poor choice for us.   Food pricings are cheap though."}
{"text":"I've been going here for more than 10 years and its definitely my favourite indian/chinese restaurant in Toronto. The food is really good and priced affordably."}
{"text":"Don't get confused ITS NOT CHINESE ITS INDIAN CHINESE. Greasy nasty and stinky food. Surprised that it got 4 stars. Ordered chilli chicken Tom yam and beef. Tom yam tastes nothing like Tom yam. Servers are rude and unprofessional. Never ever going back"}
{"text":"Where do I start the dirty plates and spoons that we sent back three times, the Hair in our soup or the attitude we got from the manager when I said I won't pay for soup with HAIR in it HORRIBLE experience"}
{"text":"Good Hakka food, however they do offer a few things that are not hakka but beware, even though they say some things are not spicy, it still is! My little sister ordered chicken wonton noodle soup, and she could not even finish it because it was too spicy for her.  Other than that, their food was okay. Most of the food tasted average, and I was really disappointed with some dishes, such as the Shrimp Pakora, however the chilli chicken and manchurian chicken was really good! (however, half of my family did not really enjoy it because it was a bit too spicy for them).   The restaurant itself was nicely decorated. However, the server we got was kind of rude to us."}
{"text":"I came to this Hakka place after a friend had recommended it.  It's in a small strip plaza with minimal parking.  The inside looks very clean and simple.  We ordered five dishes which were hits and misses.  So we started off with the hot and sour soup which was alright, pretty standard in terms of flavor. Then we had the cottage special pepper chicken.  This was one of my favorite dishes out of the five.  It was crunchy, not dry, a slight kick and perfect with a squeeze of lime juice. Next up was the Beef 88 which came with a bowl of rice (at least that's what the waiter said).  This was by far the worst dish.  We didn't bother to finish it.  It had no flavor/taste whatsoever so it just tasted like slightly cold slices of bland beef.  The fourth dish was plain fried chicken.  The color on them was nice, not too dark and the wings were of a decent size but unfortunately it wasn't crispy enough.  We didn't bother to eat these at the restaurant but took them home to rebake them for a crunchy texture.  Lastly was the chili chicken which was delicious.  It wasn't overly spicy so if you love your spice it might not have enough of a kick but it was perfectly spicy for me without having to make me sweat or give me a runny nose.  I would come back again but either try something new or stick to the few dishes I enjoyed."}
{"text":"We went earlier in the evening thinking we wanted a snack. We changed our mind and decided to get something in between an appetizer and dinner. While we ordered one item, the staff made sure if it was shared between two people they would charge us for two people. The food is ok but ethics are questionable to say the least. We've decided not to come here again..!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, good prices, and good service from nice waiters. Definitely my favourite hakka restaurant :)"}
{"text":"this review is specific for this Ellesmere location.  I've had better experience at the Steeles and Markham location.    servings here seemed smaller.  The food including chili chicken came out cold to the touch.  Clearly they made a huge batch since it was a commonly ordered item.    Im determined to try as many hakka restuarants as i can to search for the best chili chicken.  This location is not a contender for sure."}
{"text":"Great place for Hakka style Chinese food in North York. Lots of good dishes, but I would watch out if you don't enjoy spicy food to ask specifically for non spicy options."}
