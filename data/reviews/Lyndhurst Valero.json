{"text":"if i could give this business 0 starts i would. terrible costomer service and the owner is a umprofessionial person. i will never again in my life eat here. also there was a tuna tooth in my sandwich, they better hope i dont sue them."}
{"text":"I won't be buying gas or any other items here any longer. I have witnessed the same worker (possibly owner) be quite rude to me and other customers three times now (at the Subway stand and regular gas station cash register). It's not polite to shout at a customer about lettuce on their sandwich when you, the subway employee, were the one who heard incorrectly, or seem inconvenienced when the customer does not know what they've won on a scratch off lottery ticket. . I plan to shop elsewhere for gas and convenience store items in the future. One plus is that this place is in a convenient location but I will go the extra mile to go to the GetGo or Marathon down the street."}
{"text":"This is now called Valero Gas. Nice staff, plus a Subway, a fine wine selection, movie rentals,  firewood, propane exchange, and ice. Now if we could just lower those gas prices a bit!"}
