{"text":"This was an excellent stop for a burger. Local, fresh and delicious!!  We ordered the Local Yokel and Bonfire Burgers which were both cooked perfectly. The service was fast and friendly. This place is worth every penny."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Warning...it is small, but really makes up in the quality of food, atmosphere and customer service. The place fills up quickly at lunch time, so if you can get there early...then give yourself a gold star. The 7th heaven burger was fabulous and my guest enjoy their lunch as well.   Our server, Sophie, was very charming and a delight. She made sure that our beverages never ran dry and check in on how we were doing - which I love. Fantastic job, Sophie!  The decor was interesting and the place was clean. Which I prefer cleanliness anywhere there's food. Who doesn't.  I would highly recommend, The Rail, for anyone who wants to enjoy a superb burger."}
{"text":"a burger at The Rail (no chips, no fries, no side) will run you around 10 bucks . not sure if it was the training that the server and/or  cook had received , but during a not particularly busy time, they could not get one of our patties cooked as ordered.    They get 3 stars for the tasty burger that they got right, sweet tasting italian dressing (even though not made in-house) and the fresh greens that were in the salad.  also, the one burger was taken off our bill by management and our server kept a smiling attitude about it all."}
{"text":"I came in the first time with very high expectations.  This place is just O.K. The service was great. The burger was $10 and like I said, it was just O.K.  If you want a better burger, I could make you one on my Weber for free and you would like it more because it would be soooo much better.  If you want a craft beer, stop by the West Point Market then go across the street to Swensons for the best burger in the world.    One more time, this place is just O.K......."}
{"text":"This is the place for a gourmet burger!!!  Excellent service, Always clean, The food always taste like it was just prepared, I have eaten hear a dozen times since they opened and its always been better then good.Check out the 39 positive reviews that have been filtered at the bottom of the page"}
{"text":"My favorite place to get a burger!  All of their ingredients are local. Great local beer selection and awesome milkshakes!  The \"local yokal\" burger (over easy egg with bacon) is the bomb!!"}
{"text":"In a city where you can toss a stone and hit three or four locally-owned burger restaurants without even trying I'm surprised they're doing as well as they are. The food is good, but I don't typically expect to spend over $40 for two people at a burger restaurant. For starters, at upwards of $10 per burger you should get a side of fries or a side salad included (not at the ~$3 per side they charge.) I'd be more likely to come back if they made that simple change or dropped the burger prices by a dollar or two.   I'd only suggest going here if you're interesting in over-paying for something you could get elsewhere - Swenson's, Skyway, Rockne's, Winking Lizard, On Tap or even Five Guys are all within 5 minutes' drive and offer at least an equally good burger."}
{"text":"Nothing snarky to say about this one. Went during off hours before dinner so only got an abbreviated menu and a super small specials menu. sat at bar, and normally starches as apps are a silly idea but the \"skinny fries\" with jalape√±o and sriracha are really good. Burgers, obviously, are way above board. Almost too thick, but that's forgivable when they take bacon as seriously as they do. Decor is industrial minimalist, with the obligatory communal table that I'd just as soon avoid. and white Russian milkshakes?? Really?!  Definately will be back regs"}
{"text":"Look, its expensive.   We dropped over $70 between 4 of us and 2 ordered off the kids menu.  The burgers are definitely good.  Had the crouching tiger hidden bacon.  I needed 100 napkins trying to get it down but it was worth it.  They support local products which makes you feel like your money is helping Ohio.  Then I stop and think that Ohio State Taxes make me feel like I've run naked backwards through a corn field.  Thats not the Rails fault though.  Anyways...the beer selection is good, the milk shakes rock and the service is good.  Its worth checking out and seeing for yourself."}
{"text":"This stylish, modern burger joint is a great addition to the Summit Mall area, which until now has mainly included relatively unexciting restaurants. The menu is simple but delicious, which several creative burger choices. I was also impressed that the veggie burger is delicious, which is not typical for a meat-centric place. The boozy milkshakes, as I call them, are awesome, although I recommend splitting one since otherwise you will be stuffed. Definitely check it out, whether it's for a family outing or a casual date."}
{"text":"I ordered the \"Local Yokel\", a burger with swiss cheese, bacon, and a fried egg.  It was one of the best burgers, check that, best foods I have ever eaten.  Place is a little small, we had to wait about ten minutes for a table.  There is a full bar and the employees were all very friendly and attentive.  On a sidenote; I noticed some of the bad reviews of The Rail were from vegetarians who didn't like the veggie burger.  If you crave a burger, get a burger.  Can non-vegetarians go somewhere and order a meat salad?"}
{"text":"It is very hard for me to give them only three stars since they use local ingredients, and the manager was very friendly and helpful. But at the end of the night, my husband was still hungry. This is partly due to no fries being included with the burger meal, and also partly due to the burgers not having very many toppings compared to other burger places. For my part, I loved the sweet potato fries - I don't know if I've ever had a sweet potato anything I didn't love, so that's not saying much! - but for my burger, I liked the onions that came on top better than the actual burger. Just not flavorful. I love what they're doing, and I had been so excited about trying here. It didn't live up to my expectations. Coming from Burgatory in Pittsburgh, I guess I did have pretty high standards."}
{"text":"Very good Burger place. Good ambience, great and fast service. Fried pickles were awesome."}
{"text":"First off, The Rail is all about locally sourced products, which is awesome. If you aren't into locally sourced foods which are healthier and better for our economy then head back to soviet Russia, ya fools!  That being said, you are going to pay a little more for a burger than you would at other places.  The quality of the food is fantastic, my burger is always cooked perfectly Medium Rare.  The portions are large. I usually split fries with whoever I'm with. I've never had a chance to try a milkshake or desert because I'm always too full.   My girlfriend is a vegetarian, and she loves the veggie burgers at The Rail. They are home made, so you're not just getting a MorningStar frozen patty. The also have a good hummus pita."}
{"text":"Great Burger and Milk Shake. Service was fast and good. Definitely will have to make the trip again. Well worth the hour. Large beer selection."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a good burger in the Akron area, do stop into The Rail.  They offer quite an extensive selection of protein.  All their meats are locally sourced which is pretty cool.    I've been getting their veggie burger recently and it's not bad.  I usually get my burger \"bon fire\" style which includes jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, and sriracha!  I would recommend trying the buffalo burger when they do have it available.  The meat is a little more expensive, but worth it - totes magotes.  They have a good beer selection as well if you don't feel alpha enough washing down that tasty burger with just water or soda.  Now that Metro Burger is no longer in business, The Rail only has competition from Swenson's as best burger in Akron.  They also offer occasional Yelp discounts when you check in.  Score!"}
{"text":"Nice clean burger place with a modest draft selection. Big long bar provides plenty of seating. Service was very good to. I'd go back again."}
{"text":"OMG.  I love The Rail.  Get their before 5:30 because the joint gets packed.  Lots of sports bar ambiance, but...so good.  We love the truffle fries and big thick sliced fried onion rings.  Seventh Heaven burger is our favorite.  We tend to order one burger, fries and rings and split them two ways.  The food is kind of on the rich side.  Shakes are excellent as well.  Desserts vary with the season.  I love the rail.  I've been disappointed once, and they quickly remade the dish.  All was forgiven.  For locavores."}
{"text":"Seriously the best burgers I have ever had and their milkshakes are fantastic.  Also, I have always had great service.  The selection of burgers and non-burger items is great and there is something for everyone.  I love the comfy atmosphere of the restaurant.  It is a great place to take friends."}
{"text":"Worlds best burger. Hands down. Pricey, well worth it. Great beer selection. Every item on the menu is awesome. I haven't had a bad meal here and, embarassingly, I eat here at least 1-2 times/ month. All local food. I can't speak highly neigh about this place."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had.  Reasonably priced, high quality food and great staff.  Also amazing milkshakes."}
{"text":"We love The Rail. I always get the Bonfire burger and it RULES. So incredibly delicious.   My only gripe is that fries don't come with the meal. I suppose you don't really need it with how thick the burgers are, but the shoestring fries are so delish that I just have to have some every time.    Also, their Long Island iced teas are second to none. Literally the only place I will order one. Their milkshakes are killer as well. I had the mint Oreo one and it was absolutely phenomenal.   Keep up the good work! :-)"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here on a Wednesday afternoon even after reading mixed reviews. Our experience was very good. Our server Micheal was very nice, even when we took extra time looking at the menu. Both of our burgers were very good. My wife got the Phillipe and I got the Mojo. The only suggestion would be to add on the menu that the andouille sausage in the Mojo is still red when it is cooked. We also got the cinnamon sweet potato fries. They are really good! So overall, I would recommend this restaurant to my friends."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Great service, food is great! Flavor is out of this world, so glad this is coming to canton!"}
{"text":"Great place for a good burger and a local draft beer. We really enjoyed it here. We had the andouille dip and it was pretty good, as was the milkshake"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Prices aren't the cheapest but it is worth the extra buck for the delicious burgers."}
{"text":"Been going to the Rail every week for about 4 years. The staff is good, knowledgeable and pleasant. Starting July 1, they include fries with every sandwich. Have added new menu items. The noise level is way below the threshold of pain. I am THE maven of burgers and try them everywhere. Probably 20 places. Have never had a better burger. If you find one post it."}
{"text":"The food tastes great. Trendy. Expensive.  Try getting out for less than $20 for a drink, fries and burger."}
{"text":"I will start this off by saying the food tasted yummy! However, the prices were just too high. It was also a little on the salty side. I also thought the menu was a tad bit confusing. The servers were friendly and quick. Although I didn't have beer, it would be a great place to try some. They have a ton of different beers from all sorts or breweries, including local ones."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers, great selection of local beers, friendly service.  Don't miss the truffle fries and the gruyere balls.  My kind of place.  I come here every time I pass through Akron."}
{"text":"One of the best burger joints in the country, in my experience. Perfectly satisfying, yet never tries too hard, unlike most \"gourmet\" burgers. The pinnacle of the classic burger."}
{"text":"I always want to support local enterprises, but I was not impressed with The Rail. It's early days yet so things could change, granted. I don't eat ground meat so was excited to try the veggie burger which was chickpea-based, and I love all things chickpea.  Even with blue cheese and carmelized onions on it, it was bland, bland, bland.  The bun was like Wonder Bread only 4x thicker - not acceptable.  House made potato chips not flavorful.  Tried one of the much ballyhooed milkshakes, which was very good (I had strawberry).  I will go again in case this wasn't a good day for them - I liked the ambience and when something starts up in Akron, I tend to root for its success. However, as someone who wants her food to be mmmm-good, this was as close to flavorless as food gets."}
{"text":"Great burger joint for date night. Everything we have ever ordered has been fresh and delicious. The burgers are fresh and unique. Wish there was more seating but overall awesome local joint."}
{"text":"The Rail has the best hamburger I've ever had period. I travel all over the country in my job. I have never had a better burger anywhere. I just wish I could duplicate the seasoning that they use. I gave 5 stars because you can't give 10."}
{"text":"I am not sure why anyone would give this place more than one star. I'm upset that zero stars aren't an option. I was excited that there was somewhere else that offered a veggie burger in the area, but the veggie burger at The Rail is not even edible. I spent 8 dollars on a burger that I could stomach ONE bite of. Which was only because it's rude to spit out your food.   I tried to give the burger to my girlfriend who can pretty much eat anything, but she couldn't stomach it either. I thought the fries would at least be good, but they're the equivalent of skinny Ore Ida fries from the freezer section of the grocery store.   My girlfriend had a regular, beef burger and she described it as \"O.K.\"  I will stick to the Winking Lizard and Metro Burger for my veggie burgers from now on."}
{"text":"So I have been there 2 times now. We took the in-laws there when they were in town and hoped that the first visit wasn't just a fluke. DID NOT DISAPPOINT. So very, very delicious! I had the Bootlegger the first time and it was cooked a PERFECT mid-rare. Next time around I had the burger that had truffles (can't remember the name) also cooked a perfect mid-rare. We all split an order of sweet potato fries to start and they came with this really tastey spicey mayo on top. Highly recomend. Truffle fries were tastey, but I think that I'd rather have another order of the sweet potato fries and a delicious ohio draft beer instead for the price. Highly recommend this place. Nice atmosphere. Good service both time. Great beers and great food. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"First visit   I had the rail burgers and fries,burger was cooked perfect fries were crispy. Service was  excellent.very good first time experience."}
{"text":"great beer list and fantastic burgers, im a fan"}
{"text":"Oh how I wanted you to be better. A burger-centric bar that has some decent beer. What could go wrong?  Sadly, just about everything. The space is awkwardly designed with ugly \"decayed-deco\" cement walls with exposed rebar and concrete wire that was very off-putting, and in the center, dividing the booths from the bar, is a viking long table that is supposed to be the tool for \"meeting friendly people.\" It does not work. No one wanted to sit in the middle of a small room and have a restaurant watch them eat. Also, the stools are mounted to the floor just a few inches too far so that every person at the bar has to hunch and sit precariously forward to keep their balance. Why?  I chose a beer from the tap that I had not had before. I love trying new beers. Especially local. Ohio Brewing Company Cardinal Red. Sound awesome, right? Well, not if the keg system has been flushed improperly. No beer should taste like salt and sanitizing solution. Boo on you. Never screw with a man's beer.  The whole reason I chose to eat at this place was to try the food. And that too was less than promised. I ordered the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Bacon wonton burger. I ordered it without any changes or substitutions, medium. Medium means some pink, right? I don't know anyone who would disagree with that. The menu listed the ingredients as \"A burger with pork shoulder in an Asian-style BBQ sauce with wonton and bacon.\" That sounds amazing and inventive, right?  What I got was a well-done patty with dried out pork and poorly cooked bacon, oddly over-cooked wontons and a ton of sauce to try and mask it all. When a restaurant makes a mistake on my food, I will send it back. I don't like to, because I know cooks make mistakes and they are human. But I did not send this back. There was no saving it. I had a bad beer taste in my mouth already and just wanted to leave. In fact, I left my beer unfinished at the bar. The guy next to me, who was getting hammered at 8pm, took it as soon as my back was turned and began drinking it. Wow. Then he coughed and threw it back on the bar. That says plenty.  My girlfriend got the On The Farm burger and said it was mediocre. Her bacon was the same as mine, but she found it at least somewhat enjoyable.  I left this place wishing I had come on a different night, or waited until they had their cooking down. Unfortunately, what I had experienced made me know I was not going to return to give them another chance. Not even for the fries, which were the only part of the meal I enjoyed."}
{"text":"Wow!!!!!!! Amazing burgers!!!!!! Best I've ever had!!!!!! Can't wait to come back!!!!! Must try!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I came for a burger. Stayed and went back several times for the TRUFFLE FRIES!!!! OMG!!!"}
{"text":"I own a meat market in East Cleveland so I have access to the highest quality of beef on a daily basis. I eat steak every day. So I had high expectations when my girlfriend found this place and said we should try it. The drinks are well made and tasty. The famous truffle fries are worth the hype. The burgers...on the other hand, fell flat. I was surprised to see the burger menu, it was limited and nothing screamed out special. We ordered two burgers so we could have a half. I tried to taste any special in the beef and couldn't. The burgers just weren't anything special."}
{"text":"Over $20 for a cheeseburger, fries, and one beer.  Let me rephrase- a flavorless, boring burger with a see- through-thin slice of cheese on it, and remarkably  bland fries. What a waste  While I appreciate the manager's reply to my review and offer to \"make it right,\" please keep in mind that what I was served wasn't an outlier. The food wasn't bad because of some anomaly; it's their standard fare.   I could have sent it back, but judging by the food others received around me, thin, tasteless, bland burgers are par for the course. I would have received the same disappointing, overpriced food.   Put simply, this isn't a great place to eat. It's... Eh."}
{"text":"Is there a 2.5 rating? Mediocre at best...un attentive staff with average kitchen help"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places and usually get the bob fire with onion rings every time. Nothing different tonight, but they bring me onion rings that are stuck together and in a clump. Flip them over and they burnt to a crisp. Worst ever serving no matter the restaurant. Do. It need the naked eye to realize they should not be served to even an animal."}
{"text":"The burgers are phenomenal, the beer selection is good, and the staff is friendly. Great place for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"what a great experience! the food was great & the service was excellent. we sat at the bar and still had great service. the bartender was quick to answer all of my prying questions about the sourcing and processing of their meat. my burger was great & so was my partner's. the truffle fries were so very good. the pricing was spot on and the portions were generous. the location of this place (in a mall) is a tough sell but they have really made the space their own. the interior design, decor, and graphic design were fantastic."}
{"text":"4 shinies for the fresh, generously-portioned side salad and the burger, made with locally-sourced, organic \"mostly grass-feed\" beef. And a pretty tasty Bloody Mary, too.  Not that big, so it prolly can get crowded, because its popular, even though it's located in the Summit Mall. Which may explain the uppity clientele on the Sunday afternoon I was there -- maybe just the Fairlawn locals wandering in, vanished from a few hours of conspicuous consumption. Who knows. They were snooty.  The help was nice, albeit working the hipster angle pretty hard. But they weren't pompous about it, and appeared to realize that they ought to be trying to earn their tips.   But if you're craving a good burger and you're in the area, stop in. Just make sure to bring your own friends."}
{"text":"The last 3 times I have been there my $12 hamburger taste like they cleaned the grill with it.  the Burger tasted burnt,  yet the inside was still pink.  I fell this place has gone down hill with the quality of the food..."}
{"text":"I used to love The Rail, but it had been a few years since I went there to eat. I went back in December, and I ordered the Philipe burger. It was just average - I asked for it medium and it was well-done. There was one small slice of avocado on it - like a very small slice, and they forgot the sauce that was supposed to go on it. The food just was not up to par. And it was super disappointing because I used to love this place. Hopefully it was just one off night, and that this isn't the new norm."}
{"text":"Ok the atmosphere was good, the burger and chips/fries were good. They messed up on my order completely wrong. I watched them remake it to my surprise they took it off the bun add the mushrooms forgot the onions (again) and added a piece of Swiss. Hmmmm not sure that was done properly seeing I picked it apart to see if items were under the burger. So dessert was ordered the bourbon pecan pie Very Weak piece of pie, got it to go see picture, not worth the 6.50 for sure is was so small and looks like they though it on the box !"}
{"text":"This place had a fine selection of local beer and some tasty tasty burgers. Perfect place to grab a seat at the bar, and watch the game or get some reading done. The burger seemed incredibly fresh and the bartender knew his beer. The fries were a little too good, as I didn't mean to eat them all. I will be in town more and will definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"First time visitors. We arrived on a busy Friday and joined the community table. Found hooks under the table to hang our coat and purse (perhaps a new improvement after previous Yelp customer complaints). Nice selection of local beer, wines, and even Dayton vodka!  We sipped the Friday Long Island Ice Tea special. We enjoyed the Twinsburgers--cooked medium-well to a tee. Tasty with a fresh soft bun. The truffle fries were delightful.  The decor is industrial chic with cool hanging lights, meat hooks, and a massive concrete bar. We were able to relocate from the community table to a booth but found the booths way too soft as we sank too deeply into the depth. Server was friendly and food arrived without too long of a wait. A noisy Friday with lots of TGIF energy. Will return again."}
{"text":"Good burgers ($10-$12), unique flavor combinations. I especially enjoyed the Greenwich Pig burger. A very tasty Black Cow served here in a big mason jar ($3.75). Side salad ($4) was fresh and tasty complimented by fresh ground pepper. Sweet potato fries were standard in flavor but presented in a very cool way   Nice variety of local Ohio brews. Waitstaff cool and fun. Yeah...I'd recommend it for an after work casual stop with friends or coworkers."}
{"text":"The good: well-seasoned & correctly cooked burgers & fries. The pickles were delicious.   The bad: soggy bottom bun. Pickle spear hidden under a pile of fries. Pricey for a burger.   The ugly: the service. We watched our snarky server chitchat with the woman seated at the long table when he should've been taking our order. We waited and waited and waited. Very rude, R. Your poor service left a bad taste. We noticed that some other Yelp reviewers feel the same way we do. Are you sure you want to be a waiter?"}
{"text":"A quaint little bar with great burgers and awesome service. For as busy a place as this is they keep it really clean. The bartender Steven was excellent! My drink never went empty. I had the bonfire burger with fries and Gouda mac and cheese bites to start. This burger is the right amount of hot and spicy for any taste buds. The only draw back about this place is that it's small and cramped especially when it's busy. Love this place and it's food and would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, but not consistent. We've been there three times so far. The first two were really good and the third was ok.   As others have mentioned, the seating is a little odd. The bar stools are horribly uncomfortable so I won't sit there. The communal table is ok if you only have two people in your party. The booths are fine, but not easy to get.   My favorite burger so far is the one with jalepenos. It definitely needs a little mayo on the side though. I didn't like the bacon on the local yokel however my husband loves this burger. The fries and rings are tasty! The burger temperature isn't very consistent. I've had everything from super underdone to overdone. I'm sure they will figure this out in time.   The beer selection is extensive. All in all, it's a great place for a burger and beer if you live nearby. It's not B-Spot (best burgers ever) buts it's good."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place!  I wish we had this restaurant back home!!  The food was spectacular!  I had the California Turkey burger, I believe it was called.  It was the BEST turkey burger I have ever had!! I don't remember which burger my husband had, but he loved his as well.  I also loved that most of the items were locally-sourced, grass-fed beef, organic, etc.   My only complaint is the seating.  I wish they had better seating - I'm not a fan of communal table seating.  There are a few private tables and booths, but not many so we ending up being seated at the long table where you sit shoulder to shoulder with strangers."}
{"text":"Brought out of town relatives to The Rail because it never disappoints!! Our server Lance was awesome! Lance made dinner recommendations and he was spot on! Food arrived hot and was perfectly cooked. Stayed for coffee and dessert. We love this place!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here a few weeks after they opened I did not like it. Now, I thoroughly enjoy the food here and can't wait until they come to Canton.  The Seventh Heaven burger (with Swiss added) is fantastic. It is cooked in truffle butter and it is a bit heavy, but it is delicious with the thick cut bacon. Their buns are perfect. Strong enough to handle the juices but soft enough for a great mouth feel. The blackened chicken here is pretty good too- not great, just pretty good. I had it with the Tourist which is avocado spread | spinach | red pepper mayonnaise | red onion. A good choice for a slightly lighter option.  Crouching Burger Hidden Bacon is pretty great, but not quite as great as it sounds and the Seventh Heaven is better.  The Bon Fire fries- Oh Man! These slightly better than average fries become spectacular in this format with the house made Monterey Jack cheese sauce, cornmeal crusted fried pickled jalapenos, and sriracha. These are my favorite fries anywhere, except maybe Greenhouse Tavern.  The Ohio Andouille Dip is pretty delicious but definitely something to share. The flavor, although good, can become a little monotonous part way in and it needs something to cut it.  Milkshakes are pretty decent. Had one the first time I came and it was solid. Around the same level as Red Robin (one thing they do well there is milkshakes)."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I haven't reviewed The Rail yet!!! We've been going here, and now the N. Olmstead location for quite some time now. Kevin S. Is absolutely correct. This place does get a legitimate 5 Star review! This location is on the small size but it is comfortable.    Great local brew selection, not just IPA's. The burgers are local and fresh! Even my super picky 10 year old LOVES this place. I can't possibly express how juicy (not greasy) these burgers are. The meat is so flavorful that they don't need a fancy rub on them. The cheese and bacon are plentiful too. If you don't try the rail you're cheating yourself."}
{"text":"First Ryan was an excellent waiter. Second the food was perfect. I ordered the 7th heaven burger (medium) and the handbreaded fried mushrooms. And since I was working I got a water.   My glass was never empty and the burger came out perfect. The bacon wasn't over cooked and was very good with the burger. I don't think I could have made it better at home and that says a lot.   The mushrooms were very good with the side of ranch. Nice and hot, not over cooked and breaking was lite but still gave a good flavor.   I normally would t give such praise for a burger and mushrooms but it was perfectly prepared and my server (Ryan) did such a good good it was the perfect lunch while in town for work.   I would recommend this place. Keep in mind everything is  ordered separate so your 10-12$ is just for the burger. Sides are not the cheapest either mine was $6.50 but the quality is there so enjoy."}
{"text":"Best burgers around. Top notch! Both The Rail in Fairlawn and in Canton are amazing. I love eating here!"}
{"text":"I wanted this place to be good. My husband and I ordered our burgers medium, his came well done, mine blood rare. So, I guess that equals medium??? Salad was really bad too.  won't be back!"}
{"text":"Family went while in the area and the burgers were awesome! Kids loved the shakes."}
{"text":"Not as good as five guys, but twice as expensive.  Not even as good as Swenson but 3x's the cost.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"It was average. B spot, flipside, and 5 guys all have better burgers. The patties have no flavor it is just the obnoxious amounts of toppings they place on it."}
{"text":"The veggie burger, sweet potato fries, pecan pie and Blueberry pie! Maaannn this place is the bees knees!"}
{"text":"2nd time in three days. Burgers are interesting and perfectly prepared. Grilled Caesar is another unique and yummy option. Craft beer selection is vast... Unless you want beer from Michigan. Jenna took great care of us."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to dine here for lunch today.  Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted by the hostess who had a smile and was very friendly.  We requested a booth and there was one had just become available.  The waitress explained that it needed to be cleaned off and it would be a moment.  As we waited every staff member that walked pass greeted us with a smile and a hello.  We were seated and the waiter was over within 2 minutes of us sitting.  He explained what the restaurant was known for which is burgers, milkshakes, and beer.  He also explained how the restaurant uses a lot of Ohio resources such as grass fed cows.   He gave us a few minutes to look over the menu and came back to check if we had any questions.  I asked him about two different meals and he said that he hasn't had anything bad on the menu.  I ordered the  B.E.L.T(I like eggs) and it came with skinny fries.  Our food came out very quickly.  The sandwich was average.    The restaurants ambiance was really cool.  The hooks over the bar, the upside down cow painting with all the Ohio counties, and the vintage equipment displays were really nice.  Great job on customer service and ambiance!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this place. It was a pretty decent size restaurant, pretty loud so table conversation was a bit hard. I ordered the cheddar stuffed green olives which were amazing. The appetizer came out in plenty of time before the main meal, so I wasn't feeling rushed to eat them. I ordered Mr. mariola and it was all right. Not exactly what I expected. I also ordered some truffle fries which were delicious in flavor, however at 7 bucks, I expected more than what I got. The place did have a pretty good selection of beers and seeing as how the menu changes monthly I will visit back again to see if maybe next month they'll have something better. Overall, a pretty decent place that has a lot of potential."}
{"text":"Went for a Sunday lunch. No waiting and got a booth.  The decor is cool and by the name and logo def a spot for meat eaters.   Let alone the giant butchers rail sailing above the bar.  I had a rail burger with cheddar carmalized onion and rail sauce. Sort of a Asian BBQ.   We shared the onion rings and chips. The onion rings were better.   Then we had a mocha milkshake which was delicious.   This place reminds me of B spot  in Cleveland and Flipside in Hudson.  Only a little less upscale feel, yet still cool and tasty.  Love having another option for when in that area besides fast food style metro burger.    Try it!!"}
{"text":"This place serves perfectly cooked burgers that are so juicy the bread falls apart every time.  If you don't like that, you're nuts.  The shakes here are thick and good.  Plenty of beer choices.  If you're going to the get some fries, get the truffle fries.  It's a must have at this establishment.  I love the rustic feel of this place along with the great staff.  Last time I went to this place, my friends and I were waiting for more than an hour to sit because a group of youngins were leaving their table at a pace slower than a snail; because it took so long, the manager was kind enough to bring us some appetizers to snack on while we waited and the staff trying to somewhat discretely trying to get some seats open for us.  Overall, this place is one of the best burger joints I have ever gone to."}
{"text":"Great place, great burgers.  Could be a LITTLE bit bigger, but that's only because we split them.  Other than that, pretty good atmosphere, can be great service, and never a bad time here.  Plan to wait on a table, after 6pm (rush hour)."}
{"text":"Comparing it directly to Flip Side in Hudson and B Spot in Beachwood, I'd say they both have the upper hand in the upscale burger department.  I really liked the look of the place and the atmosphere.  Incredibly comfortable booths.  Nice big bar.  A few flat screen TV's.  Real nice place.  Service was pretty good.  It was a Sunday afternoon though and not very busy so I would expect such.  The food didn't deliver though.  I ordered the Local Yokel because I am a sucker for any burger with a fried egg on it.  I ordered it medium and the server advised that the egg will be just slightly runny.  Fine by me.  The burger/meatball was cooked well and so was the egg.  Dried the whole thing out of course.  And the burger patty was, like I said, a meatball.  Like the crappy burgers my dad used to cook on the grill that puffed up too much and were the size of a half dollar.  That may be an exageration but not what I expected of course.    The bacon however was cooked just right for me - thick cut and not over or under done.    Overall, the burger tasted okay - an average burger that reminded me of something made en masse at a (bad) backyard cookout.  Just was too well done for me.  The dryish bun didn't help the situation.  The milkshakes we had pre-meal were pretty good.  I got the mocha which was sprinkled with a couple chocolate covered coffee beans.  But it was a small milkshake and I wondered what happened to the rest of it that was surely left in the big metal cup it was made in..."}
{"text":"I really like the burgers in this place.  Also a great selection of local beers.  They also do a really good chicken sandwich if you're not in mood for red meat.  Try the onion rings as a side."}
{"text":"Average food with a pretentiously high price tag for lunch."}
{"text":"So I've been back to the rail several times now and the high quality burgers along with the truffle fries are growing me. The burgers are cooked as ordered (or tend to be a little more rare). I had the bonfire med rare last time in. The jalepenos and sriracha popped with the juicy burger. The burger are still large, but I have discovered the truffle fries and cannot help myself. These are decadent and the truffle comes through strong with the fries. Overall my favorite spot in Akron to get a burger."}
{"text":"Best burger joint around.  I have tried them all and The Rail gets 5 stars"}
{"text":"This was our first experience at The Rail.  Having determined years ago that burgers deserved their own place in the food group pyramid, decided a visit was necessary.  And we were not disappointed.  Our party dined on a Classic Burger, Crouching Burger and Greenwich Pig.  All were cooked perfectly AND as ordered.  They were mouth watering to say the least.  Added sides of house made chips, onion rings and sweet potato fries.  Our server was outstanding and made regular checks to our tables keeping our beverages full.    Since this establishment is located on the perimeter of Summit Mall, parking is a challenge."}
{"text":"A couple of friends suggested The Rail and it was absolutely delicious! We got the pretzel bites for an appetizer which were warm and satisfying. The four of us got the Bon Fire, Crouching Burger, Greenwich Pig (I think) and I got a special they had that night. We all raved at how juicy and tasty they were. I also loved the sweet potato fries. My fiance said it was the best burger he has ever had. He also got a root beer float and two of us got the Nutella shake which was so yummy. Above and beyond any of that, our server, Matt, was amazing. He was hilarious, knowledgeable, and he made it such an enjoyable night out. I eagerly await going back."}
{"text":"We came in on the 4th because NOTHING WAS OPEN.  It was fine.  Nothing to write home about, and the service wasn't the best.  But the food was fine, it was nice to have a lot of home grown stuff on the menu.  The space was a bit too cramped for me though, I would have rather waited for our own table then sharing some communal area."}
{"text":"If want you want is a 10 dollar undercooked and bland burger with 4 dollar burnt potato chips with not enough dip to cover them, then this place is perfect. Prepare to spend 20 bucks for what you can get at Wendy's or Burger King for 5."}
{"text":"These burgers are fantastic!!  I usually order the burger to take home for dinner.  They are very tasty and my mouth always waters when I think about ordering the burgers.  The staff is very welcoming and helpful.  I would highly recommend trying there burgers."}
{"text":"A couple years later & my review stands about the same. The burgers here just do not blow me away. My cheeseburger with saut√©ed mushrooms & onions was covered in onions which made it all very soggy. The meat was really mushy too which just ruined it for me. At $9+ and not including any sides, it's just overpriced. Honestly, I just keep coming back for the shakes."}
{"text":"Great prices and food. Love that any burger can be made into a veggie burger at no charge...that's nearly unheard of! Great atmosphere, close to shopping. First time there, will go again."}
{"text":"Best hamburger you can get! The drinks, sides and salads are great too - and I love it's locally sourced. I take people here all the time and and really wanting one of those t- shirts!   8/24/16 update: still good food but staff needs better training. Had to break our party up after 45 min wait because all large tables had been sat with small groups and not turned over after meal was done. Food came out cold and had to ask server three times for drinks, condiments, etc. Stick to weekends when A team is there. When mgmt informed no remediation offered (or asked for) but...."}
{"text":"Management has worked hard to rectify the situation.  My family appreciates their response."}
{"text":"..excellent service, friendly, helpful, cozy comfy seating, short wait when busy...the menu: wanted to try everything..lol..shakes were fab..definately on my places to revisit when next in the area!"}
{"text":"There's a great selection of beers and good burgers. Not fine dining, but good for a relaxed lunch. I haven't ever liked a restaurant connected to a mall shopping center, but this one isn't bad. Don't expect many healthy options though!"}
{"text":"Straight up running Akron's Burger Game. Shakes are top. This place has yet to make me upset. The meat is outstanding. Burgers always cooked perfect. Do not miss out on this place. Usually pretty busy . I will wait hours to eat here.    SEEDS"}
{"text":"We really love this place. Great food, great service, amazing drink selection, nice atmosphere, and prices are perfect. We'd be regulars if they were a little closer!"}
{"text":"The only place I can compare this too is the B spot and the Rail blows them away hands down better burger, better fries and better drinks"}
{"text":"I have to admit - I wasn't impressed this time - I wonder why? The burger with the sausage was ok  And I thought the sweet potato fries were just not as good as the first time I was here  I don't know it was just ho hum this time around"}
{"text":"Wow!  Probably one of the best hamburgers I've ever had. Same quality every time I go back. Not as we'll know as b-spot, but the food is much better and less expensive. They also have great milkshakes. They are the real thing too!  They specialize in all things OH-IO. The only downside is that the restaurant is too small and most prime times will mean a 1/2 wait.  I can't say enough about how good this place is."}
{"text":"My wife and I stayed in the area for a date weekend.  We tried The Rail and weren't disappointed.  They are big on local sourcing for their beer, meat and other foods.  If you are into craft beers, they have about 10 or 12 Ohio beers to choose from.  I had the Lamb / Beef burger and loved it.  There were so many good choices on the menu, I would certainly come back.  Burgers were priced in the $9 - $12 range, fries and salads were a-la-carte.  Our waiter was excellent and gave us some great advice on hiking at Cuyahoga Valley National Park."}
{"text":"I like to come here occasionally. the food is really rich and I'm usually on a diet. LOL.  I got the burger of the month: turkey burger. It was mildly dry, but overall good.  Got skinny fries with it. Very good.  I got a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  I also got a sampler of their home brew the rail pilsner, very good.    Very nice people and good food and vibe.  Overall, I'd definitely go back and take friends."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times. I love the food, all locally grown. Gouda Mac n cheese bites are incredible. Burgers are all good, and they also have a wide beer selection with many local breweries. In my opinion this is better than B-Spot."}
{"text":"This was our second visit.  The first time was great - which is why I gave it two stars.  Our second visit was for Sunday lunch.  Our burger was too cold to even melt the cheese.  Onion rings, which were great last time were greasy and not hot.  At the end of the meal our appetizer was still warmer than our main dish.  The manager was nice and offered to take the burger off but we decided to just not come back.  I felt greasy after eating what I had.  Big disappointment"}
{"text":"When I go back to Ohio I like to go to places that we don't have anywhere else.  Enter The Rail.  Everything is locally sourced.  Local cows.  Stadium Mustard on the table.  *If you are not from OH and do not know what this is, go find a way to try it!  OMG.  I miss some things about Ohio, and I really do miss the local restaurants that offer authentic Ohio cuisine.    ESPECIALLY when they serve Great Lakes Christmas Ale on tap! (Once again, if you have never tried this, you are in for a great treat.  Go get it!)   I had a burger and my mom had the chicken club.  We shared an order of fries (which was plenty!)   Service was great.  Ambiance was nice. Big fan here."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of eating here the other night I've been wondering what we have been waiting for!  The burgers are AMAZING!  and if you like it rare they actually cook it rare!  I   was in heaven!  I got the Local Yokel \"naked\" (no bun) -rare!  It was a party on my palate!  Cooked to perfection with locally sourced ingredients (beef, thick cut bacon and egg).  The burger selection isn't too overwhelming but enough to tantalize the tastebuds!  if you don't like the choices you can build your own!  They even offer a vegetarian burger.  The sides are a la carte but worth it......the truffle oil fries.....JUST TRY THEM, you won't regret it!!!The onion rings are very good and the homemade chips are delicious.  The Beer selection is awesome with some local choices!  They even offer a wide variety of milkshakes (alcohol spiked ones if you wish!!!)  My son got the Nutella shake and it was creamy, thick and delicious.  We sat at the bar and the service was quick and the staff was friendly.  Can't wait to go back again and try some of the other goodies on the menu!    The Rail is where you want to go for an amazing to die for burger!  Don't listen to the negative reviews those people are crazy!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger is Akron. There are lots of places, but this is the I always go back to. My usual is the bootlegger with bacon medium. Love their sweet potato fries! Burgers are always great, I just wish the fires were more consistently good as they seem to always be different. Normally they are great about getting me new ones if they are bad."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow. In our never ending quest for the best burgers in Ohio, my friends and I ended up at the Rail for a Sunday dinner. We were seated almost immediately, and our attentive waitress gave us the extra time we needed to decide which of the many burgers we wanted to try. I ended up choosing the Seventh Heaven, and my two friends chose the Local Yokel and the Crouching Tiger (Hidden Bacon) burger. We also ordered sweet potato and truffle fries to share.  Our food came out impressively fast, and everything was cooked exactly how we had requested it. My friends and I all divided up our burgers so we could try each other's, which was an excellent choice! All of them were incredible.  These burgers are heavy duty, definitely not a light meal by anyone's standard. As I bit into my friend's Crouching Tiger burger topped with pulled pork and bacon, I laughed to myself imagining the ridiculous amount of calories crammed into this spectacular meat masterpiece. But I definitely didn't care at all. Every burger was flavorful, juicy, and oh so wonderful. The fries were also fantastic. Not a single complaint here. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The worse thing about going to Ohio State is that I won't be able to eat these burgers, that and these extensive a#$ classes.  Burgers are unique to their chefs and The Rail has me as a regular (when I can afford it)  Service is always excellent. Managers express open involvement in the operations of their restaurant. Good craft beer selection. Fresh and delicious food.  All of their burgers are AMAZING, but to three that you can never go wrong with:  Mr. Mariola Crouching Tiger Hidden Bacon *droool Local Yokel  And don't forget some fries or onion rings, both of which are great. Their strawberry milkshakes always hits the spot!  Fresh meat, fresh vegetables and unique designs and taste with every burger. It's definitely one of Akron's hidden gems, and I think Canton's now as well o.O"}
{"text":"We try a lot of local gourmet burger joints but this one stands out as the best. Perfectly cooked burgers with amazing toppings and actual truffle fries ...they r not stingy with the truffle oil making them awesome! Quality food every time we go."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Rail twice.  Both times were disappointing but the second time put the nail in the rail coffin for us.  We would rather go to the B-Spot or FlipSide when we want a burger.  The biggest complaint we both have is we've never gotten our burger cooked to the right temperature.  I mean, you are a burger place...learn to cook a burger!  The first time both of our \"medium\" burgers were very rare in the center and the last time we were served dried out hockey pucks.    The rest of the food is okay...but not spectacular or worth eating a bad burger for.  I like the decor, but at 5'0\" tall the bar stools and the high top tables are a bit uncomfortable for me.  The stools are not spaced right and I felt like I was going to fall off the whole time.   Don't waste your money here...."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Great beer selection. Good is good but of course on the pricey side. Staff was a bit slow and the restaurant wasn't even hay busy."}
{"text":"I've gone back a number of times and each has been very good.  The burgers have been cooked correctly and the red onion jam is fantastic.  Service is always great.  I said in my first review that I would give this place a second chance, and I'm glad I did."}
{"text":"https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1026374674087269&id=813110038747068  The Rail @Fairlawn  Date with my wife tonight at The Rail. This is small little place attached to the mall in Fairlawn. This was my fourth visit here and if that tells you anything I've kept going back. I've never been at this place when it's not packed. They also don't do reservations which is fine for their size and foot traffic, but it can be aggravating to have an hour wait each time you go. My advice go and check in with a plan of walking around the mall for 45 minutes while you wait. They're good about holding your time when you come back. The atmosphere of this place is bustling and loud and a lot of the restaurant is made up of a very large community table which can be intimidating to people not used to it. I must say I enjoy eating here because it lends itself to a fun enjoyable time especially if you're with more people. So let's get right into the whole point, the food. I'm an appetizer junky and I really enjoy that this place has a few options when most 'burger bar' joint don't bother. My wife and I pursued the selection and finally with a bit of pleading on my wife's part we settled on the Gouda Mac & Cheese bites with buffalo ranch dipping sauce. Best thing I can say about these is you know exactly what you're getting. I mean it's deep fried mac & cheese. Can you really screw it up? I don't think so. They're handmade which is always a nice touch, but they're very tasty just not the flair I usually am looking for with an app. Sauce was good too and helped the dish along well. The burgers at this place are the star in my opinion! Such great flavor choices. I went with the '12 Titles' (burger of the month) which had a bratwurst patty, apple slaw, and a dijon sauce. It was fantastic. Had a nice brat feel and flavor. All the condiments went very well with it as well. My wife had the 'Crouching Burger Hidden Bacon' one of my favorites. It comes with pulled pork, rail sauce, bacon, and a crispy wonton. Everything on this burger works very well and the best part is that wonton. Remember putting chips on your sandwich as a kid (or last week) and that satisfying tasty crunch it gave it? That is this burger but a hundred times better. Last note on the burger is the bun. Best burger bun in Cleveland IMHO! This might seem like a minor thing, but it's almost 50% of your burger, right? It matters and here it's amazing. Burger is the star at this place and it really shines. We shared the 'skinny fries' which are just the restaurants house fries. The fries here are good, not great. I personally prefer that nice crisp on my fries and they generally come out soft here. It's not bad in fact they're quite good, but they don't have that gobble them down quality that some places have. A little ketchup or malt vinegar really ups the game here.  No shakes this time, but this place is definitely in my repeat business list and always a destination if there's any reason for me to be at the mall in Fairlawn. Sometimes I even make an excuse to head out that way! ;) Bill for 2 with waters, appetizer, burgers, and shared fries was $33.89.  P.S. - Nice pickle with the burger. Love my pickles and this was a good one!   Atmosphere -  Price -              Quality -           Taste -              Service -           Good Points - Flavor options for the burgers are always a treat. Love trying new things and going back to old favorites. -  Best bun ever. -  Fun vibrant atmosphere.  Bad Points - Fries not my favorite."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in Summit Mall. Can be busy but the bar is always a great spot to grab a pint and burger.  Burgers are made well. Fries are good.   Chicken sandwich is sometimes dry but overall the food quality is consistent and good.  Service has always been spot on."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.  Atmosphere was great.  I ended up getting the crouching tiger burger and bonfire fries.  Burger was cooked perfectly but the fries were over sauced so they ended up being a little soggy for my liking.  My wife got the grilled chicken sandwich and she loved it.  She also got the grilled Caesar which she loved.  Over all great burger place!"}
{"text":"Amazing  I have tried numerous burgers here and am never disappointed.  The beef is Ohio sourced,  is fresh and it's obvious in the taste  By far, my favorite place to grab a burger"}
{"text":"I would give this place one star but maybe they had a rough night so the rating is based on the \"benefit of the doubt.\"  I came in and was greeted immediately by the hostess, she was probably the only person in the joint that acted like she liked her job.  I went to the bar to place a to-go order and grab a drink while I waited.  I was not really impressed with the bartender.  It just seemed like she didn't want to be there.  She got me a drink and it was ok, but nothing impressive.  I don't like sugary anything so I ordered the drink without the juice and she over filled it with soda instead of just adding a splash of it.  No big deal, still wanted to try some food.  I overheard her say she had appetizer specials after 9pm so when the male bartender came over and I asked him, he told me that all of the apps were half off!  So I ordered 2 appetizers and when I got my bill nothing was half off; everything was full price!  So I asked what happened and he couldn't explain. He asked the female bartender, who told the 2 gentlemen next to me about these specials, but failed to tell me specifically, and she told me that it was only a select menu.  This would have probably changed my order had I known it was a special menu.    When I checked my order (sweet potato fries and Hummus, all veggies) the fries were cold like they sat in the window for some time, so I asked the male bartender to recook them.  He sighed and took them back to the kitchen.  All of this took almost an hour, for 2 things! Ridiculous!!!!! Finally, when I got home, I found that my veggies were clear aka rotten aka disgusting aka embarrassing!!  I'll just come back during happy hour so I don't have to pay full price for some junk, but I probably won't be back to this location.  Maybe next time, but not for a long time Rail!!"}
{"text":"Best chain burger place in Akron! Can't go wrong with the 7th Heaven burger!! A lil sweet from the onion jam and salty from the truffle oil...best burger I've ever had!! Plus the fries are skinny and they are simply divine! Atmosphere is always fun and many drinks to choose from!!"}
{"text":"Although the servers seemed to be hustling, it looked like a Chinese fire drill- no one was getting serviced. We decided to stick it out based on prior reviews.  It ended up being the most expensive mediocre burgers. Will not be going back.  The buffalo chicken dip had huge chunks of chicken.  The amount of chicken was good but you shouldn't need a knife to cut up your dip.  Not worth an $80 bill at all!!!"}
{"text":"45 minutes to wait for a table only to watch other people walk right in and get a seat. Drove 40 minutes to be frustrated. Piss poor customer service and wait times. Will never give a place like this my business. Only reason why they are getting 1 star is because I can't give them 0 stars."}
{"text":"Ummmm yummmm!  So delish!  Locally sourced meat.  Perfect sized burgers.... And the truffle fries... Oh my!  I ordered THE BOOTLEGGER with aged cheddar, bourbon bbq sauce, tobacco onions.  So good!"}
{"text":"This was a good burger place. Fresh meat and good toppings, and a good bun, which sometimes makes the burger what it is. I enjoyed the sweet potato fries also. The sauces add a kick to all burgers.  The staff was very nice and patient. Especially to the numbskulls that took 10 mins to order 2 burgers. With a menu in front if them, but asking insane questions.  I'll come back again."}
{"text":"We wanted to try something new owner stopped at Rail in Fairlawn.  We were greeted as soon as we walked in by the hostess.  She was very polite and friendly.  As we stood at the hostess stand any employee who walked pass us also greeted.  The customer service was great.  The server checked on us several times throughout our time at the restaurant.  We had the County Line Chicken sandwich an the B.E.L.T.  Both sandwiches were underwhelming.  But the d√©cor and customer service is probably the only reason that we would return."}
{"text":"The burgers are cooked perfectly with very unique toppings. Good beer selection and happy hour prices"}
{"text":"Loved It! Had the Bessie Burger with Homemade Tater Tots - at the recommendation of the waiter- and it was great! The waiter, Mark, delivered great service with a great personality to make the experience even better. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The burger was perfect, char grilled but very juicy. The grilled onions and mushrooms were done well, they used fresh mushrooms. Lots of flavor.  Truffle fries were very oily, so fyi. Friendly service."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. I was excited by the idea of a burger joint where I could get any of the burgers on the menu with a veggie burger instead that wasn't a chain. I went to eat in but the place was packed and the seating options were not ideal. Only bar chairs or booths- neither being my cup of tea. I ordered the Twinsburger with no bacon and skinny fries to go. One of my friends ordered the same and the other got a real burger, but I can't remember which. My vegetarian friend and I went to eat our burgers and were shocked at how horrible they were. My friend couldn't even manage one bite and I barely made it through two. Completely inedible. The fries didn't taste fresh and were way too salty. I tried to call to complain, but no one answered. Sent several emails on their website, but didn't hear back. I will never go back. Total letdown and way over priced.  I should probably add that I joined Yelp just to write this review."}
{"text":"I agree with Amanda G. - since going corporate, the service just isn't the same at the Rail Akron. We miss the good old days when it was just a single burger joint! We were there this past Sunday for a very late lunch and my order ticket was put in wrong. Our server made it right. The burger had cheese and bacon on it (I can't eat dairy - b/c well indigestion reasons but my husband can) so our server took it off the bill and gave that burger to us in a to-go box for my husband. She kept checking on us and let us know when my new burger would be out - all great! But... this hiccup is the third time in as many times as we've been there that we've seen mix-ups or problems with orders. Let's see, last I got a regular bun in stead of a gluten-free one... um, I can't recall what happened two months ago. But we're three for three for three now. And we typically don't go at busy times. I don't know if it's an issue with turnover in wait staff or kitchen staff or just growing pains. I do want to stress that this time, our server was really good about making it right. And we still enjoy the burgers, and the shakes. But man, those fries are waaaaaaay too salty now. Yuck. So I can't give 5 stars anymore. Maybe in another 12-18 months we'll see. FYI if you like steaks, definitely visit Rail's sister steakhouse City Square. It's outstanding and has not disappointed us yet."}
{"text":"My son is the real burger aficionado in the family; I knew this place had a good reputation on that count, so I suggested we stop here after a post-Christmas shopping trip. Late Sat. afternoon/early evening - the place was crowded just as I had expected, but our wait was rather reasonable. After only about 10 minutes, we were offered a seat at the bar, which was just fine with us.  Service was prompt; my son ordered a Bootlegger burger that sounded good to him and I got a pair of the Roast Beast Sliders. They have a good selection of beers on tap - I don't care for IPA's that much, and being familiar with most of their other selections, I ordered the house Meat Hook Pilsner, brewed by Millersburg Brewing. It was a very good pilsner - clean and crisp, a nice solid beer to help wash your food down.  Some might call the place loud, but it is not overly so - and that is not something that ever bothered me. That may however, have accounted for the greens that found their way onto my sliders - even though I had asked the server to have the kitchen hold the spinach. They tasted fine, but I was thinking that if they cut the meat a little differently they would have not fallen apart quite so easily. As for my son's burger, he said it was rather good, but that he'd had better. We shared his skinny fries, which were perfectly done.  If I'd have been hungrier, I would have tried a burger myself; they looked very good to me. That said, our experience was fine and I certainly wouldn't mind coming back here again. It was interesting to see they do some \"programming\" - with some special beer tastings with appetizers; that might make for a fun night out with some friends. All in all, a nice place; trendy d√©cor - a nice mix of clientele. Service was competent and reasonably efficient - mixing in a few smiles and friendly banter wouldn't hurt."}
{"text":"The rail has awesome burgers. Any burger really -  but beware they are juicy burgers so if you're not into that, you may be turned off. The skinny fries are tasty as well. I always get their draft beer and I love how they use Ohio businesses and breweries for everything writhing their food. The atmosphere is very laid back and they have awesome drink specials. Definitely our go-to burger joint!"}
{"text":"Good location, great food, plentiful portions & wonderful service. I got the burger with the bbq sauce and tobacco fries, my husband and son got a burger with andouille sausage. All of the food was great! Loved it-yum yum!"}
{"text":"Still amazing burgers! But why was my wine warm? Unchilled wine...hmmmm...I didn't hate it but would have preferred it cold."}
{"text":"I miss The Rail after moving away from Akron earlier this year. This place is perfect in my mind. The burgers are fantastic. Ohio draft beer selection is great too. Management is always on top of things. Miss this place very much."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for The Rail, and was slightly let down. The burgers were underwhelming for the price and what I was expecting (I was thinking it was going to be like B-Spot's). The overall service and atmosphere was great. Unfortunately, the place is really small (make a reservation if you can). Overall, it was not a bad place, and I'd try it again."}
{"text":"Holy cow! And pig... And chicken... Believe it or not, I'm referring to the burger I enjoyed at The Rail in Akron, Ohio. While visiting my best friend, his wife mentioned an outstanding burger joint she had discovered recently. Outstanding is an understatement!  Now about that burger... We arrived early on a Friday, just as they were opening. We hadn't eaten anything that morning (highly recommended) and I still had breakfast on my mind. Naturally, I zeroed in on two burgers. One was the Local Yokel and the other was the Lumberjack. Each featured a fried egg and bacon. The latter also had maple syrup and was served on Sourdough bread.  Our server was great! He suggested I get the Local Yokel and substitute the burger patty from the Mojo burger. The Mojo had a beef and ground andouille sausage patty.  OMG! This was an incredible burger! And like I said before, cow, pig and chicken. When I ordered this concoction, my friend said \"PETA must hate this burger\".  But I didn't. This was one of the top two burgers I've ever tried. Each topping could be tasted and that burger patty was incomprehensibly good! Altogether, it really sang. I'm glad The Rail was recommended to us, but I'm sad that it's so far away. I hope everyone in Ohio appreciates this burger Mecca as much as I do!"}
{"text":"Wait, wait, WAIT.  Don't dismiss this review because it's five-star.  Allow this to simmer, just a bit.  I'm writing what I call the \"non-filtered v. filtered\" review.  Here's where The Rail stands, as of today, in the eyes of Yelp.  Sixteen reviews, average out to 2.7 stars.  Ouch.  Not too good, right?  Based on that, I may not even give it a shot, even if it were close, I were hungry, I wanted an upscale burger, and so on.  Not so fast.  Let's just take a look at the filtered reviews.  Easy enough, just go to the bottom of the page, click the link, type some letters that make no sense, and you'll see thirty-two reviews that Yelp decided weren't worthy of full review status, for one reason or another.  I've had reviews filtered.  It happens.  But think about this:  Fully two-thirds of ALL the reviews (prior to my own) have been filtered.  Huh.  That's a trough-load of reviews.  Thirty-two filtered reviews, but get this:  The average there is 4.3 stars.  (Which is right about where I would put The Rail, for the record.)  Mix all 48 reviews together, and you get 3.8 stars, which would pretty much look to the world of Yelp like the place is a solid four stars.  NOT two-and-a-half stars.  And it IS a solid four stars.  One off for pricey drinks and semi-pricey grub, but that's the only complaint.  Great decor, wonderful service, true locally-sourced food and beers.  It if were within bike-riding distance, it would be my once-a-week dinner-on-a-barstool place.  It might be our every-other week.  Five stars, just to rectify what I feel is a statistical glitch in the system, although four stars would be my actual call. Food is every bit as good as B-Spot, and you can actually carry on a conversation.  (And, unlike B-Spot, The Rail got my order right.  So there.)"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! I think it is the best Ohio Raised beef burger around.  They have my favorite adult milkshake.  Nutella Crunch with a shot a Maker's Mark in a kids glass!!!"}
{"text":"The Rail is too expensive for a burger joint. I understand the high end burger concept but the rail underwhelms. Average burger is $10-$11. The sweet potato fries at over $4.00 were a total rip off. They were about the size of a small fry at McD. Burger size was small for $10. Drinks were ok. I guess they must do OK as they continue to franchise but I would take Swensons or 5 guys over The Rail any day."}
{"text":"All my friends and I love The Rail.  The food is amazing, simple as that.  Get something, its going to be good.  Only downside is there can be a wait, but such is life.  If your in the area defiantly consider it."}
{"text":"The Rail seemed like an exciting concept. B Spot hasn't come to Akron yet and Metro Burger is inconsistent. I loved the decor and the logo and I had high expectations for the food.   Alas, it wasn't meant to be. While the room is nice and the service friendly, it all goes downhill from there pretty quickly. First off, the names of the burgers. You would think that a burger called the Greenwich Pig would have some sort of pork element, right? I did, and so did my server who informed us that it came as a burger with pulled pork and that it was great. When my burger came without any pork, I asked and it turned out that the server had this dish confused with another one. When your own staff is confused by your inexplicably named menu items, its clear you didnt put much thought into your concept.   The burger itself: Overcharred and dry. Definitely not the medium that I ordered...this was clearly well done. It was also supposed to come with grilled onions and did not. The blue cheese overpowered the taste of everything and the only bit of meat flavor I got was the char. The spinach was a nice touch, and the bun was good...but it was far too big for the teeny tiny burger inside.   My better half had a ho-hum Brie-L-T. These guys do not know how to cook bacon.   The thin cut fries were decent, if a bit salty. On the plus side, the onion rings were pretty great and earn The Rail their 2nd star in this review - but I dont go to an upscale burger joint for onion rings alone.  Finally, the price. These guys want to play in the gourmet marketplace, but their food wouldn't even earn them a 3rd star at half the price.   This is a tremendous disappointment and another reason why the Akron food scene is a depressing bore."}
{"text":"Wish I could go 2 1/2 stars here.  It's not that I didn't enjoy my experience at The Rail, it's just that I had eaten at Flip Side just a few days earlier, and my dinner here paled in comparison.  This is a fairly small place, a large chunk of the floor is taken up by a communal table.  As it was \"date night\" for us, we opted to wait for an actual table rather than side at the communal table (or the bar).  Not unexpected, by any means, but maybe something you'd have to consider.  Plus, if the mall's busy, so will The Rail.  And the waiting area is about 5' x 7', not big.   I'm also not wild about the lighting.  The used old-fashioned looking 40w light bulbs  These look cool (ok, I thought so, the wife not so much) BUT there's not a whole lot of light over your table...  I had the Crouching Burger (Hidden Bacon).  Yes, that's their name for it, not some joke I'm trying to make. The burger has pulled pork and thick-cut bacon (the bacon is \"hidden\" under the burger patty).  Here we go...  OK bun, REALLY good, smokey, thick bacon.  So far, so good.  The pulled pork is a little tough, not much flavor.  The burger is interesting--nice sear, and the moist interior is almost crumbly-- a coarser than normal grind.  This give the burger a chewier texture.  It's OK.  All in all, it's good, but the star is actually the bacon.  And the really nice crisp-tart pickle spear.  So, would I come back.  I would, but that's probably because I wasn't going to leave this general area and I had the taste for a good burger.  If I was willing to make a little drive, say to Hudson, I'd likely satisfy my craving for a high-end burger somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great meal at a good price.  I liked the local angle of the origin of the food that is served.  The staff was personally invested in the quality of the experience and seemed genuinely committed to our satisfaction.  Great burger...the Greenwich Pig was rich and delicious.  Add in the Truffle Fries and $3 Marg's and you can't beat that evening."}
{"text":"While Akron has a plethora of burger establishments to tickle any carnivore's fancy, Akron lacks a truly upscale burger experience. The Rail, which opened recently, fill that void.  All their protein is locally-produced (read: Ohio-made). I'm not sure if the beef is grass-fed and organic, but that is doubtful. Their focus on growing locally makes the meat taste fresher and not as bland as burgers that require extensive freezing.  They have a full-service bar where they are quite creative with their drinks.  I ordered the Crouching Burger (Hidden Bacon) -- corny name, I know. It was essentially a Western-style burger with their homemade The Rail Sauce, a tangy BBQ sauce that makes me water just thinking about it. The bacon was thick-cut and breathtaking. My only complaint is that fries are a few bucks extra, although the burgers are not for the faint of heart. I mean, they are massive!"}
{"text":"Wow. Fantastic Burgers!! Cooked to perfection. Great selection of unique burgers. Fair beer selection. Try the pretzel or the pickle apps. Totally different and tasty. Definitely coming again when in town. Must try!"}
{"text":"Ok. Now we're talking. Visit number two was leaps and bounds above the first.   I went thanks to some great customer service and an invitation for a second chance.  (And a comped meal didn't hurt either.) I'm so glad I did.  I had to be back to work, so I passed on drinks, but the selection of bottled and draft beers was impressive.  Lots of great choices.   I had the Local Yokel which was perfectly medium. The juiciness of the burger paired with an over easy egg, Swiss cheese, and that bacon... Oh that bacon... Made for just the kind of lunch I needed to treat myself to.  Finish it off with the Nutella shake, and that's one of the finest shake and burger experiences I've had in a long time.   There are so many places doing the craft burger thing now. My way of sorting then lies in the way each burger joint does the fundamentals. The Rail puts a lot of detail into 3 big things: the meat, the bun, and the experience. Both visits have featured attentive, positive, and helpful staff, even during peak hours.  Excellent. Very, very great job. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Really good burgers with side dishes that were different but good.  Loved the patio with the annuals so colorful and relaxing away from the tv screens and bar area.  Will be back for the food."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, and awesome burgers! The servers are on their A game every time I'm there"}
{"text":"Having tried a couple burger specialty restaurants, this is my favorite!   Some restaurants meat blend is too bland, but The Rail gets it right. The burgers a juicy and flavorful. Some other restaurants try to hard to be innovative and create complicated messes that overwhelm the palate. Again, The Rail gets it right. They have the normal everyday burger which even picky eaters can enjoy and they also have unique burgers that allow foodies something new and complex to try. Either way, the recipes are well thought out and the flavor combinations compliment each other well.   My personal favorite is Bon Fire which has jalapeno peppers, pepper jack cheese, and sriracha. Everything is better with sriracha!! And the best part is that they know that to complement any unique crazy burger, you should just a good old PLAIN french fry. No rosemary fancy dancy palate destroyer. Just good salted french fries that you can dress up or down to suit whatever you enjoy."}
{"text":"Trendy joint with craft burgers. Nice atmosphere. Good menu selection.  There were many different burgers from which to choose. There were other options for the non-burger eaters.   I had the Crouching Burger. It was decent but the flavor of the beef was overpowered by the pork, which was very good. I wound up taking some of the pork off the sandwich to balance the flavor and had a nice mound of it to eat as a \"side\".  My burger was undercooked but I still enjoyed the meal.  I would certainly dine here again to try the other creations and maybe get something for the non-burger eaters as well."}
{"text":"Some place you walk out of you regret giving them your hard earned money. While this place is a more expensive burger then \"those\" other places, you will not regret it. My date and I had 2 great burgers and some truffle fries. The burgers were both OUTSTANDING. They had a great beef flavor and were cooked to order just right. The truffle fries were quite tasty but neither one of us were blown away with truffle flavor. Next time in, and there will be a next time soon, we will go for the standard fries."}
{"text":"In town for work a bit hungry so I stopped in the rail (first place I saw) and to my surprise this was a pretty happening spot. The atmosphere is really cool for the sports lover that wants to take your significant other out without missing your favorite game or if you just want to enjoy a game period.   I'm a vegetarian so the upside down cow logo threw me for a loop so I wasn't  expecting much for me to enjoy here BUT I tried the hippie pita \"AWESOME\" and the truffle fries \"worth every penny\". The pita was really fresh and filled with fresh veggies and humus. The fries were bursting with flavor and topped with fresh shaved cheese. The Rail did not disappoint!!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and it is safe to say I can give this place 5 stars. First time I came with my daughter and we each got our own burger & split them both.  I had the Greenwich Pig & she had the BonFire burger.  Hands down, mine was the better of the two! Had a date night with the BF & I ordered it again.  I ordered them medium each time & the second time I had to send it back because it was way too rare for me.  They remade the whole thing and sent me a new one!    I think the fries are a little over rated and over priced, but look out for monthly specials. I went in May and they had BonFire fries for $5 and they were worth it; otherwise I think they are a tad pricey.  I dig the interior and vibe this place offers!    I have been to B-SPot & Flipside and I like this place the best. My opinion."}
{"text":"At the price, this place is just average for burgers.  I would say it's better than the big M, but not as good as B spot or five guys.  The nachos and milk shake are decent tho if that's your thing."}
{"text":"This place found a way to make a burger stand out. You won't be disappointed if you wait for a table. Thats just the problem, though. This place just doesn't turn tables quick and you will be squished into a non existent waiting area because there will be always be a wait."}
{"text":"It's rare that I think a burger is worth $12 - but it certainly was!  The food was fresh and flavorful - the burger was cooked to temp - and the service was great!"}
{"text":"There were a lot of people there and the wait to get a table was a little long but, after we got our table I orders a burger with cheese and bacon and a side of truffle fries. After we ate I ordered a milkshake to go and it was so good! The food is a little pricy but it is quality meat and great food. Our waiter was very nice and very talkative"}
{"text":"== ORIGINAL RATING: 3 Stars ==  Great burgers, crap desserts.  We each had a burger (7th Heaven and The Tourist) and loved them both. Very juicy and delicious toppings. We also had sweet potato fries with chipotle mayo - also excellent. If we had stopped there, this would be a 5-star review.  Regrettably, we decided to stay for dessert.  The first warning sign came when they advertised that they only use Smith Dairy - as if that's a good thing. The brownie sundae was mediocre: scoops of cheap Ruggles ice cream, \"chocolate sauce\" that was watered down, and didn't taste like chocolate, and the brownie tasted like it came from an instant mix.   The pumpkin pie milkshake was weak. Again, low quality Smith Dairy milk, with some pumpkin spice thrown in. There are places with great milkshakes, but this wasn't one of them.  If they're going to brag about using quality local ingredients, they need to ditch Smith Dairy and go with a better brand like Hartzler or Snowville Creamery - much better quality, and actually tastes like milk is supposed to taste.  The dessert completely changed the experience for us, and we felt like crap the rest of the day.  Besides the dessert, the atmosphere was a letdown. Too many tables crammed into too small a space. Even in a booth, you still have people sitting nearby in your face. If we eat here again, we'll probably just do takeout. And skip the dessert.  == UPDATE 9/23/2015 ==  We've been back multiple times since then, and although we've continued to avoid the desserts, we have consistently had good experiences with the food and service. For this reason I will increase my rating to 4 stars. Just SKIP the dessert!"}
{"text":"This place has some tasty burgers! Their burger combinations are creative and they have something for everyone. Their beef is all ohio raised, which is great for the local fans. I did not pay much attention to the rest of the menu, but there seems to be options for the non burger lover as well. Their drink specials are pretty tasty and cheap. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"OK, so I went to The Rail last night and tried the Twinsburger.  Now you would think the name alone would be a good indicator, let alone the menu description (Double Burger, Aged Cheddar, BBQ Sauce, Tobacco Onions) but my eyes went straight to aged cheddar and BBQ and I ordered.  Imagine my surprise and relative embarrassment when my burger arrived with TWO giant patties!  Honestly, this thing was huge, something more befitting Andr√© the Giant.  Don't get me wrong.  It was perfectly prepared and utterly delicious.  Loved the BBQ.  I think the best part of this burger was the entertainment value it lent to my dining companions.  I soldiered through about half of it not will to give in to the intimidating size and miraculously maintained a clean shirt.  Definite winner.  Tried the fried pickles and onion rings.  Both very good.  It was very busy, not a seat available and still the service was excellent.  My only suggestion is to ask for extra napkins up front, especially if you're planning on trying the Twinsburger..."}
{"text":"I really love this place and their monthly and weekend burger specials. I usually get a greenwhich pig and gouda mac n cheese bites but have tried most everything. Excellent every time. Service always great but i find myself there at odd times a lot when they aren't busy."}
{"text":"This is our second visit here. Great October specials. Good service. Interesting beer selections.recommend."}
{"text":"2nd visit: had the burger with pulled pork, and guess what? Tasted more like a pulled pork sandwich, detracted from the burger.  Truffle fries were colder than I like, and not as bountiful as neighbors skinny fries.  Kitchen: LOUD.  8 seats over at the bar; why do I need to hear their shout outs for orders?"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and good service.  Nice decor.  My wife had a cheeseburger with egg and I got the cheeseburger with thick-cut bacon.  Large, thick & heavy burgers.  Very fresh but nothing special that you couldn't do on your own grill.  I remember thinking that Red Robin's gourmet burgers were better.  The pretzel bites were average (how much can you do to improve a pretzel?) and the beer cheese sauce is a bit bland.  Excellent skinny fries. Also, the peanut butter & jelly shake was given two thumbs up by my wife who is a PB snob of the highest order.  As the other reviews have said, it was somewhat pricey (for ex. the PB&J shake was $6.50).  A piece of peach pie runs $4.50.  Note: some of the pics on Yelp show the round stools they previously had which have been replaced with tall pub chairs.  Majority of the seating is still at the bar and booths but they still have a community long table in the center."}
{"text":"YUM! This place was packed at 3:00pm on a Saturday, so my boyfriend and I decided to sit at the bar (great choice).  We ordered a beer, vanilla milkshake, the bootlegger burger, the tourist burger, and an order of skinny fries..our bill was $32!  The prices are great for the quality of the burgers.  I love that they use local ingredients and the milkshakes are to die for.  Our server Diana was very friendly and gave us great service.  We will definitely be back and can't wait to try more of their burgers!"}
{"text":"The best hamburger I've ever had. I asked for the rarest and it was falling apart pink. The meat was fresh and, seasoned, and  perfectly aged. I had the one with the egg on top. My friend had the one with pulled pork.   It was hard to choose because all of the burgers were great concepts. If the rest are as good as the ones we tried I will be visiting this place again and again...  One big bonus it's that the handcut fries are never ending and they offer gluten free buns. It was hard to get the waiter to understands the concept of a lettuce wrap on my burger but I got it and it was great!   There is a massive beer selection if you are into that sort of thing!"}
{"text":"I travel a bit and look for local. This is it! Local beef, local brews. If your carb conscious any burger can be ordered naked, no bun and it is presented very well. If you are here for dinner look for Anna, she knows her taps!"}
{"text":"7 th heaven.   That is how I felt after eating the 7th Heaven at the rail.  From their trendy decor with meat hooks hanging from the ceiling to the truffle fries, all the way to the burger....I was in 7th heaven.     There is a lot to be said by a restaurant that puts so much time and effort into the quality and details of their food.   This is exactly what the rail does.    From the time the cook prepares the food to the moment it's sitting in front of you, there is only one thing to be expected...the best.   Ohio raised beef, ohio grown vegetables are only a few of the things to look forward to when visiting the rail.   The milkshakes are mixed 50s style in this quaint joint and fries are cut on premise.   It's truly a memorable experience.     I usually let the readers know what's my favorite and what could be worked on.   In my opinion you can order anything on the menu with truffle fries and you'll be in 7th heaven."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to this place for a while. It was worth the wait. The burgers were cooked to perfection. Fries had a unique flavor that I couldn't quite figure out but it was delicious nonetheless. I wasn't planning on getting a drink but then I tried my wife's Long Island Iced Tea and I decided I needed one for myself as well.   We decided to go early because we tried to go once before and the wait then was over an hour. We showed up at 4 on a Saturday and were told that the wait would be 15-20 minutes or we could be seated right away outside. It was a beautiful day so we opted for outside. We were our server's only table outside, but she did a great job and was very attentive.   I ordered the Crouching Burger which is loaded with thick bacon, pork shoulder, crispy wonton, rail sauce. Oh, and the burger is a 1/2 pound. The only problem with the burger was that I couldn't set it down once I picked it up. The juice from the pork was dripping all over so the bun would have been all soggy if I put it down. The crispy wonton added a nice crunch to the burger.   My wife and I each got a burger and shared the fries. With the burger being so large, sharing the fries was the right choice. The burgers are a bit pricey. Mine was $12 on its own. Normally, I like having my own fries because I can usually finish them, but I was satisfied after the meal.   The only real issue I would have with this place is the price but knowing that everything is from Ohio, it doesn't surprise me and since I'm a born and raised Buckeye, I'm willing to spend the extra money to support this place."}
{"text":"1st time I went to the one in Belden Village and it was pretty good.  This time I took my family.  My wife and I each ordered a Long Island Ice Tea......the worst I have ever had....ever!  We ordered 3 burgers, 2 were fine but my wife's burger and fries was not hot.  This is a burger place.  They did replace it but come on, that's what you do is make burgers.  Next time I will spend my $60 somewhere else."}
{"text":"We were impressed by the service, lack of grease on the burgers, and the quality of the locally sourced meats for the burgers."}
{"text":"I have been to the Rail countless times and always have had great food, service and beer. I like the fact that the Rail supports local farmers and breweries.   I usually get a cheddar burger and truffle fries. You have to get a side of truffle fries. They are incredible!   The Rail has a great selection of draft and bottle beer.   The Rail's shakes are excellent as well.   A caution, make sure you order your burger on a cooking level higher than you normally would. I order mine well done because if I order a medium cooked burger it will be raw on the inside. They are delicious and worth asking questions about cooking.   Great place to stop and take a break from shopping and get a great meal."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers. Truly juicy with a soft delicious bun. The sweet potato fries are thin and crisp not soggy and not greasy. Local brews are a must. Our server recommend 2 perfect pairings w our meals. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but delicious burgers and other locally sourced food."}
{"text":"I like the whole idea of ingredients being locally grown or bought. I like the unique combination on the menu. I enjoy their milkshake. The selection on the menu is interesting but didn't seem to blend well for some (e.g. Oscar, The Tourist burgers). The beef is juicy but not exceptionally beefy. The burgers are decent but not remarkable and consistent. The beer selection is pretty good and they carry some local brews.   The interior however left a bit to be desired. The bar area is fine and nicely decorated but what's up with long community tables?? It seems like they don't know if they want to be a trendy bar or a hip restaurant.  The service was excellent so I'd certainly make future visits after work for a quick drink and appetizers."}
{"text":"We arrived for an early dinner around 4pm and the place was sparsely populated at this time of day. We were greeted the moment we stepped in the door and was shown to our table. The host was friendly and made us feel welcomed on this, our first visit to the upside down cow restaurant.  There was a full bar, several booths, several tables and one long community table in the middle of the dining room.  There were several televisions on the wall, one tuned to CNBC and the rest on ESPN. Our server greeted us warmly and told us about the day's special \"Tonic Tuesday\", gave us the menu and two additional sheets of drinks and specials. They listed some cool sounding cocktails and a nice selection of handspun milkshakes. They also have a nice selection of local brews on one of the menus.  For dinner, we ordered a Crouching Burger (medium well), a Veggie Burger and homemade chips. Our food arrived in about 20 minutes. The homemade chips was served in a pint beer glass with a side of dipping sauce while the burgers was served on lined pie pans.  The chips were good, and our burgers were okay. The veggie burger was \"mushy\" and did not that the texture that was desired. The Crouching Burger was messy to eat because a part of the meat broke off inside. I really wanted to be \"wowed\" by their food because of their prices but alas, I was not.   I might give them another try soon and order something else ~ we'll see."}
{"text":"The 5 stars covers the truffle fries alone!  I had the 7th Heaven burger as well. The beef was tasty and lean and the bacon was thick and not overdone. I'm looking forward to trying the other burgers on the menu.   The atmosphere is perfect - it looks like a renovated warehouse where they added a long high-top down the center and a dozen or so booths on the sides.   The bar was well stocked and added an upscale look.   The service was perfect, as well.   Everything running and looking this good in the first week speaks well of the place, too."}
{"text":"My US Wide Yelping continues as I hit this next spot which is located in Akron Oh. Now from the looks of this place you are pretty much ready to chow down on a dead cow right off the bat; after all the Logo and Sign for this spot features a silhouette of a cow hanging upside down!! You enter this feeling like what I would assume a cave man felt like, waiting to be served a huge slab of raw cow! After all the sign says it all \"RAIL\" complete with upside down huge cow silhouette!   The decor here is pretty cool, fact they even sport those hooks the butchers hang the cows on when slaughtering them, nicely placed over a nice bar on a racking system that you would see at any slaughter house. Fact this is the type of place you'd probably want to bring your annoying ass vegan friend to eat, just purely for the humor of it all, and don't get it twisted, they do server up a good veggie burger!!   The word out there is that \"RAIL\" serves up nothing but locally raised cows. What that means to me really is nothing short of, \"Ok, I may have passed this cow some where on my drive to this place at some point or another!\"  Have it your way, these local cows must be treated well because they sure are mighty tasty and served on a fresh bun, or naked if you prefer! Regardless of the style and way you like your burger, this place is surely doing it right. They have a host of different styled burgers and honestly I've been happy with ever cow I've ever ate here!   So bring a vegan friend along with you and enjoy the slaughter house called rail, you'll come back, this I can guarantee you!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place I look for and can't wait to review bc it is so good. I can safely say this was a 5 star experience for me and the reasons are very simple. Phenomenal food, great atmosphere, and good service. What more do you want from a dining experience? So let me tell you why this is my new favorite place...  First of all, they had a special of $3 long islands that were just terrific so it started out great. I got the 7th Heaven burger and the name fits it very well. I can honestly say this was the best burger I have ever had. And not by a little, by far. It had thick cut bacon, onion jam and truffle butter. Seriously? I'm not sure it was legal, but nonetheless it was fantastic. My husband got the Bon Fire burger and when I tried it I thought, OMG this is my favorite burger too! It had some heat, with pickled jalape√±os and siracha but we love spicy food and this was just a great spicy burger. What I loved most, they cook it perfectly! Like absolutely perfectly. So as sides we got the truffle fries and homemade chips and both were a great compliment to the burger. The chips came with a dipping sauce that was out of this world, although I have no idea what was in it. The fries were really skinny, but the truffle and shaved parm were really great.   The service was solid as well, we hung out for 2 hours and drank and ate and no one rushed us and they always made sure we had everything we needed. They suggested beers to my husband and even talked him into one which isn't easy! I also tried a drink that my friend got called a cherry spiked lemonade and it was delicious. I probably would have got it myself if I wasn't so cheap and happy with the long islands.   In conclusion this is just a fantastic place. I will absolutely be back and I just hope I can go to the gym more in order to eat here more. And the one thing that is bothering me....I can't find anything wrong with this place."}
{"text":"I had a burger and a side of fried pickles..excellent! They also have a lot of local Brewers on tap,others as well"}
{"text":"I went to this place with a friend for after-dinner drinks, and we LOVED it. We sat at the bar, had some cocktails, and chatted with the bartender who was an older gentleman. He was so fantastic and accommodating, and was social but not to the point where my friend and I couldn't have our own conversation. I was definitely pleased with the atmosphere and I can't wait to go back to eat a full meal there."}
{"text":"A casual atmosphere delivering a quality meal. The idea of supporting Ohio farmers strengthens the overall positive experience."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, it was so hard to choose! The fries are crispy and thin, perfectly seasoned. I ended up with the Mojo burger and it did not disappoint. We also had the fried pickles and they were lightly battered and seasoned well. Can't wait until these guys come to Columbus!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. So glad we found it during our travels. They use locally sourced ingredients. Can't recommend the fried pickles with jalape√±o ranch and the local yokel burger enough. Grabbing a Nutella crunch shake to go on the way out. Check it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"If the service matched the quality of the burgers then they would deserve five stars. If only they had just the basic service I would forgive them but when the servers are standing at the back of the restaurant talking and you have to ask if they would mind offering you a drink and take your order, then I sorry it just does not matter how good the food is I am not going back. There are just to many good restaurants around to have to accept such poor service so \"Rhino\" your service sucks, if you don't like the service industry leave."}
{"text":"Second time at this particular establishment, messed our order up again, we drove out here cause I wanted a good burger, they are good but a little more expensive than they are worth.  Got a bison burger and a local yocal, good burgers messy, great bacon, my wife got the special burger for the week. It was supposed to have pulled pork, it wasn't served w/ it. So they brought it out on a plate, ha seriously, well they did comp the burger have my wife a fresh one for take home, also the features punkin milk shake they have posted everywhere, as the feature mind you, they ran out today, well it's Thursday and it's your special milk shake.  Good food really it's okay, especially if your looking for good grease hangover food, well we were not.  But pricey for not prepared to order burgers and not having the featured selections is a bad business I think.  But I just won't drive out of my way to go to \"the rail\" again that's all.  Will I come back yes."}
{"text":"While visiting family in The Akron area... we stopped here for a bite to eat. Nice selection of local beer on tap... \" the rail\" was so good! All 3 of us had the cranberry walnut salad with grilled chicken and cranberry vinaigrette. So delicious! The chicken was tasty and not over cooked, greens were fresh and topped with feta cheese.. so so good!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to visit here since we noticed the place being constructed, but it's been quite awhile since we have been to Akron. Before New Year's, my husband and two friends of ours came here on my demand since it was something I wanted to try.  At 7pm on a Friday (I think) night the place was crowded and we had about a 20 minute wait. There is no real waiting area, and as it was raining, we were cramped by the door. When a party of 7 came in to be seated, there was just no room at all, and we were fortunately seated after that.  The place is pretty neat inside - I, unlike other reviewers, liked the close space, dark style, and large chandeliers. I loved the lights hanging down from the bar and though it did a pretty good job theming itself like a dimly lit butchers room. I didn't sit at the bar, but we had a 4 person high top table in between the bar and the booths. It was a bit cramped for all of us and if our 4th person had actually gotten food, I'm quite sure it wouldn't have fit on the table.  Drinks are a bit over priced here, but they have a good selection. My husband ended up with a La Chouffe and I with a razzmatini or something along the lines of a raspberry martini. My martini was so-so - nothing memorable - but the only memorable drink for both us and the people working in the restaurant it seemed was my friends candy cane milk shake with two shots of crown royal black whiskey. A few guy came over to ask him about his strange (though AMAZINGLY delicious) concoction.   I ordered the 7th Heaven burger. The truffle butter, red onion jam, and bacon were all downright amazing, but I was a bit annoyed that my burger came out at about room temperature and tasted like it had been sitting awhile. So sad with such delicious toppings. I felt also like there wasn't enough and that the large burger patty didn't have the right ratio to the small amount of toppings (everyone else thought the same about their burger). I only ate 2/3rds of the patty because of this, and it was just a fairly large patty. The meat was good quality, but nothing special in terms of seasoning or taste. It just wasn't my kind of thing - not bad, mind you - just nothing to rave about.  My husband's Twinsburger had barely any cheese, and then we found a small ball about the size of a dime off the side of the burger - somehow all the cheese kind of...rolled off? Very strange. But the tobacco onions were amazing and the downright best thing about the burger.  We ordered onion rings which were the stars of the meal - beer battered and cooked to perfection. Those were quite good.  Overall, this place is okay, but it's not the place I'd be running back to when I visit Akron. I stick with some of the other places around."}
{"text":"Great place.  Just had dinner  the there.   I had a cheese  burger. Beer. The service was excellent.  I've never had a bad  experience  here.  Our waiter  was mark he war great."}
{"text":"I went here with my very finicky father, who promptly looked as though someone had invited him to a roadkill buffet when he saw the menu, replete with every fancy burger topping you can imagine. Truffle butter? Not my dad's speed. I gently steered him to the build-your-own section of the menu, and we both went with pretty basic cheeseburgers and fries. Pretty soon, my dad was pronouncing his burger \"the best he had ever eaten.\" I'd have to say it ranked up there for me, too. The local beef is really flavorful and properly seasoned. For sides, Dad chose the standard fries and I got the sweet potato version, both very good. We agreed that the beer selection was top-notch, with lots of local suds to choose from. If my dad has anything to say about it, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised by the negative reviews. At 11:45 on a Sunday there was a 20 minute wait for a table, but there was plenty of room at the bar.  $3 Bloody Mary's or Mimosas?  Yes, please.    We both ordered the Local Yokel and were very, very pleased.  The bacon that they use is incredible.  I have to admit that altho' the burger was amazing, I kept wishing that I would have gotten a more simply dressed burger so that I could enjoy the meat itself more.  I have never had a better tasting burger in that it was so simple and beefy and delicious.  If I could add another half star, I would but I took off a star because I can see how people who are particular about it could complain about the temperature of their burger.  I ordered mine medium-rare and it was definitely on the rare side... not a big deal for me, but like I said, I can see how someone could be upset.  My husband also ordered his medium-rare and his was closer to medium; there was an obvious difference between the two.  This didn't bother either of us, but I thought it should be mentioned.  We shared an order of the skinny fries and they were very good too.    The staff that we dealt with was friendly, but not overly so, and we didn't have to wait very long for our meal.  I will definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Great burgers and milkshakes!  Atmosphere is casual and fun. Worth a visit for sure!  Take out is always easy, on time and warm....which is a rarity!"}
{"text":"Locally sourced beef, beers, and other things. A truly great meal at such an affordable price. Our staff was attentive and just a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"For a place with a dead cow logo and meat hooks around the bar, they had a bomb vegetarian burger.  The patty itself was tasty, substantial and well-textured. And they get bonus points for something simple: choose your burger style/toppings first, then your protein: beef, chicken, veg. It's simple but effective and it saves me the fatty moment of disappointment at other restaurants when the veggie burger is served with spinach on a wheat bun with a side salad and everyone else's comes with cheese and fries.  So, I had one with tobacco onions, cheddar,  bourbon BBQ sauce. Super tasty.  Meat piles were enjoyed, too.   Burgers ranged between $8-12 with no sides.   We had sweet potato fries with amazing chipotle mayo, skinny fries and truffle fries, all a few bucks each.   Decent selection of drinks with some good Ohio choices.   I'm hesitant to review service or system because we came for a super late lunch, but those things were super."}
{"text":"Great burgers. The server asked if I wanted to upgrade to the truffle fries but didn't mention the extreme cost to do so. I'd pass on the truffle fries and stick with the traditional burger and fry option. Overall, great spot."}
{"text":"In town for a swim meet.  Arrived with an anticipated large party of 12. Manager was able to accommodate within 30 minutes, just as the balance of our party arrived, without sacrificing the service to the other guest or us. Server was attentive and friendly.  Food arrived quickly without issue. Everyone enjoyed their food and we all left happy."}
{"text":"Love The Rail!! The burgers are locally sourced and done really well, and the beer selection is smart and pairs well. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"$30 included a great hamburger, French fries, two beers and a nice tip. I will be back."}
{"text":"Only giving one star because I have to chose one.  We were interested to try this place out to see how it compared to Flip Side but we were disappointed as soon as we walked in.  The gentleman at the hostess stand seemed annoyed with something and was very rude, most likely because we had a stroller with us. He asked if we were going to need a sling for the infant seat but asked with an attitude.  After standing there for a minutes and being looked at like we had three heads, we decided to leave the place without even trying it out.  I guess we will continue to patronize Flip Side as they provide good service along with good food. This is not a good place for kids and especially if you have a stroller.  Who would have thought that a stroller at the mall restaurant is not a good idea."}
{"text":"First visit tonight.  I was the only one out of our party who does not eat red meat so I was pleasantly surprised to see the veggie burger option.  It was delicious!  Our server, Diane, was attentive and came back several times to make sure our food was ok and refilled drinks in a timely fashion.  You have a great waitress there!!"}
{"text":"Bit into my medium rare hamburger and got a mouth full of cold sticky raw meat.  The waitress suggested I order medium well in the future.  I told her I've eaten a few burgers in my life and that one was definitely rare.  I was the only person in the establishment (seemed weird at first), so the grill was probably cold and they turned it on just to make my burger, but thats not really an excuse.  Manager took half off my burger.  Since they don't come with a side of fries or anything, I paid $4.50 for a bun, bacon, and cheese.  I understand why I was the only person there."}
{"text":"So, so good! Visiting from out of town, and friends took me here. Loved the truffle fries and my \"Crouching Burger\" was incredible. Enjoyed every bite! The service was also great...would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Had a rough experience, but in the past it's always been really good burgers from Ohio. recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"I was staying across the street from The Rail at the Hilton for a wedding and we ended up coming to The Rail 2 out of the 3 days we were in town. Great beers and really great burgers! I had the same burger on both visits-the 7th Heaven- and it was amazing! Tons of bacon, truffle butter, and red onion jam...everything I love! The only suggestion I'd give is that they might want to but the butter directly on the bun. They put the butter between the bacon and the burger so it doesn't really get soaked up and a lot of it just melted off onto my plate. No biggie because I just sopped it up, but I think spreading it directly on the bun would work out better.  For sides we tried the truffle fries, onion rings, chips, and sweet potato fries. My fav were the house-made chips but the onion rings were a big hit with our group as well. Great beer selection and DELICIOUS shakes...we sampled the pumpkin pie and it had actual chunks of pumpkin pie in it....yea, amazing! If I'm ever passing through Fairlawn again I will definitely be hitting up The Rail!"}
{"text":"The food is great and the servers are very friendly. This restaurant has the best burgers around. We have been going there since they opened and we are never disappointed. They also have gluten free buns now. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Really great burger. Flew in from San Fran and and came here for dinner. My only complaint is the ranch was very watered down. It wasn't thick like ranch normally is.  I've actually never even seen ranch like this before. The sauce that came with the sweet potato fries was too spicy so I asked for ranch. Service was great.  I'll be back for the burger."}
{"text":"Hamburger was one of the best I have ever had, except the buns are too small. Excellent grilled flavor and outstanding quality meat! Deep fried fresh mozzarella was also outstanding, but not a good value at $6 for four small pieces. Six pieces would have been much better.  The onion rings were just OK, too greasy and not up to the quality of the burger or the appetizer. My wife had the \"skinny fries\" which are just plain sad and a waste of money and calories.  Too bad the \"sides\" just are not up to par with the level of the sandwiches or the prices."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food and service were terrific. Will definitely go back. Spinach and artchoke dip, burgers, burgers, omg burgers..."}
{"text":"I don't eat red meat but my group loooved their burgers here. I highly enjoyed my $3 mimosa and caprese salad. Their skinny french fries were very, very tasty as well.  This place is a little bit cramped, and a lot of the seating is one big table where you're shoulder to shoulder with strangers... I did not like that at all. It's nice that they have a patio but that too is very, very small.   Seems like a pretty cool place, they should expand this or move to another vacant location at the mall to expand.  Good mall eat overall."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my daughter and son in law who live in the area. Busy night with a wait list, but they tell everyone to check in at a certain time before your allotted wait- which I think is a great idea...works well. We were seated a a community raised table (we were given the choice). Atmosphere is fun, but not too loud....now to the food--  Appetizers were just ok, and I would give 5 stars if these were better--we got the pretzel bites ( good but nothing special) and the stacked fries.  These were good, but the fries don't seem to be hand cut and nothing out of the ordinary.  Burgers, hands down, awesome.  Cooked precisely to order, with unique and well balanced toppings.  Drinks were well done and service was prompt and timely but not pushy! We will be back! Server was great!"}
{"text":"Delicious, locally-sourced, upscale pub food in a laid back environment. Gotta love a place that has as many milkshakes on the menu as craft beers, and if you get fries, make sure they're of the truffle variety!"}
{"text":"Terrific place. Unassuming location. Very good food. Tasty! And the drinks are outta this world. Super shakes. Super cold local brewed craft beer. Super cold! I highly recommend a visit here."}
{"text":"Great burger. I had the mojo. I think it was a lil on the high side for the quality but I would go back"}
{"text":"We've been here twice, and both times we've had some of the greatest service! It's always so quick and efficient, even on a busy Saturday night. Plus, the burgers and food are amazing, and we love the all-Ohio fare."}
{"text":"Had the Local Yokel Burger and the Wisconsin Burger (special).  Both were damn good burgers.  The flavors went so well together that extra condiments were not needed.  The meat was tender and juicy.  Just when we thought the meal couldn't get any better we ordered the bourbon pecan pie (baked locally).  OH EM GEE (and I hate when ppl use that).  It was the best pie I've ever had and I don't usually like pecan pie. It was perfect.  No other words are needed to describe it. A must get when visiting.  Beer selection was great!"}
{"text":"I'm glad the shiracha fries are no longer on the menu because they were terrible!!!  The service and quality of food has changed since our first visit approx. one year!!! We couldn't wait to return and would have dinner there twice a month. However the last few visits the service and food have been slow and disappointing. When busy the staff seem overwhelmed- I understand wanting to serve a table of 5 every meal at once, but 3 of our burgers/fries were cold. Service was slow. We saw our food sitting beneath the heat lamp, meals should be served when ready, or the chef should prioritize differently per orders.  Burgers have also been inconsistent."}
{"text":"We were sat quickly in the \"Pastures,\" the service was slow, and we ordered an appetizer that never came until we asked for them.  Now I ordered the seventh heaven burger using the beefalo burger, it taste like it was cooked on an outdoor barbeque grill. [That's a good thing] when we got the now offered \"free gouda bites \" they were good. I would come back and just chalk the service up to being short handed!"}
{"text":"I've been here exactly once, but I loved the burger I received. My dinner guest was less enthusiastic but I blame it on getting the burger well done.  The beef they get rivals the beef out West and if I were closer I'd hit this place up more often.  I can't remember how the fries were because the burger was so flavorful and juicy. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Can't give 5* because it's not life changing but burgers are amazing. Sometimes tho there is a wait but if it's less then 15 and not in dead winter it's worth it."}
{"text":"We've come here a couple times and like it a lot! The Local Yokel burger with a fried egg and bacon on top is my favorite. I haven't tried the truffle fries yet, but the onion rings and skinny fries with vinegar are pretty delicious!  The seating is a little weird with a large \"community\" table in the center, where you eat next to or across from strangers. DH and I opted for a normal booth. I like the decor though, especially the meat hooks hanging above the bar. The service was average, with a few employees getting confused about things but hopefully that will straighten out quickly.   The milkshakes are delicious, and they have a great beer selection, so kids and parents are happy.   We will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty partial to the state of Ohio and The Rail is 100% Buckeye. I spent a Saturday afternoon here eating delicious Ohio beef, drinking Ohio brewed beer, and watching the Scarlet and Gray beat down another opponent in defense of their national title. The Rail is consistently on a wait, but I found myself a spot at the end of the bar where Diana took care of me for the next 7 hours. It's been a while, but it was comforting and I felt at home sitting in a bar full of Buckeye fans where it is forbidden to change the football channel through the entirety of the game.  I stayed long enough to have two burgers during my visit. I had the Local Yokel and a classic burger with fresh mozzarella and grilled mushrooms. Both burgers were excellent with half pound patties sourced from Ohio and with loosely packed beef providing a tasty and juicy burger. As far as drinks, I had a nice sampling of four Ohio brews with the Thirsty Dog Siberian Russian Imperial Stout being my favorite. And I had one sampling of the Ohio distilled Watershed Bourbon which had a familiar fumy taste like Knob Creek.  Service was outstanding as I always had food or drink in front of me. Although working on the floor, the server Laura was also friendly often stopping by striking up conversation and assuring I had everything I needed. All of the other employees I encountered throughout the day were quite amiable. The price point for the burgers may be a little high for this area but was just right for me as some gourmet burger joints where I'm from charge 30-50% higher with inferior product.  The Rail is a must stop from now on when I'm in the area. If you're looking for a good burger and brews you should stop by and support local."}
{"text":"No idea why their food is so good. I think it's quality ingredients.   There are lots of very good burgers out there but, for some reason, theirs are just outstanding. Even the plain basic burger medium rate is top notch."}
{"text":"Amazing staff and great burgers!  I stopped in here before leaving for Columbus and I judged the book by its cover (building) and I was impressed. I sat at the bar and was immediately welcomed. The bar tender made a beer recommendation which was their signature beer and it was a good choice for sure. It wasn't a fistful of hops but yet not a glass of water either.  I asked about his favorite burger (since he prolly eats here a lot between shifts) and I was pleased. I added some mozzarella to my burger per another bar tender's recommendation and score again!  All in all if they are this consistent with their service and food I will always come back.  Ps- I left the names of the beer and burger off as you need to have your own experience! :D"}
{"text":"Got a burger and fries here today and it was phenomenal! I finished my burger embarrassingly fast and it was amazing, and they have thin cut fries with great seasoning. A little bit of a wait but nothing you wouldn't expect out of a burger place. I would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Locally sourced burgers, fries, and beer... and one of the best Yelp check-in deals I have ever had! Nice work Rail!   I love the bon fire burger - only suggestion maybe add chili pepper or something for a little extra kick? I'm a huge fan of thin french fries and their shoe string fries are awesome.   What the hell good is a burger without a good selection of beers? Never fear, Rail has several awesome taps and some good local brews.   For Akron, this place is top notch."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of time for lunch, at first, it appeared as another trendy eatery in a mall venue. The burgers looked good, I've been here twice for lunch mid week and have sampled their chicken sandwiches (one friend the other grilled) and I was satisfied, enjoyed my meals (they have been good and tasty) on both occasions.  The service was good,  prompt with a smile. I'll be back to sample more items off their menu and see how dinner goes."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite burger spot and a place to bring friends from out of town for an excellent burger. Since expanding though, even our go to in Akron has fallen in quality.   The fries (when sold separately) were always warm and fresh. Now they are more shoelace fries that seem to always be cold. They include them with burgers but honestly I could leave them. The sweet potato fries are still a great addition so if you're a fan, pay the extra and swap to these.   For the burgers, you could always tell how fresh the meat was because of how juicy each bite way. Over time, the burgers have become drier (comparing a burger that was prepared medium rare) and much chewier. Still a great flavor to the burger which is why we will return, but not as frequently as we used to. The child's burger is flat and tasteless. Not a bad idea to skip the kids meal and just have your kid split a burger or take a full size home. They'll thank you for it.   As others have mentioned, they have a great beer list offering a variety across each season. Also, for the kids (or the kid in me) the vanilla milkshake is terrific. You can taste the actual bean rather than an artificial flavoring. My son loves this place solely for the milkshakes.   The service is always kind despite the challenge of the constant rush (expect a wait time). We've never had a bad service experience here.   Still a place we will go back to and hoping the past few visits were just a fluke of quality. Would recommend to try at least once."}
{"text":"I loved my meal!  I was a little worried since I'm not a burger and beer kinda girl, but I had some wine and a veggie burger. One of the best veggie burgers ever!  No heated up Boca Burger here!  Crafted here with a perfect, not too much bread, bun. The buns don't get all soggy either. Really good spot for a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Good ambiance and service, locally-supplied, great burgers and shakes. LOVE the Bootlegger Burger and the Apple Pie Shake (seasonal I think)."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining at the Rail for the first time a couple of weeks ago. I'm a big fan of the push towards locally sourced food, and the quality of the patties Rail served is unparalleled. Burgers were cooked perfectly to our specifications, and were well portioned. My father and I split the Bootlegger burger (barbecue sauce,  aged cheddar, and onion straws) and the Bonfire burger (pepperjack cheese, jalapeno peppers, and sriracha sauce). Both were excellent, though I think I slightly preferred the Bonfire burger, which was smoky and spicy.   There was a great selection of beer on draft from Ohio, and the sides were also delicious, definitely big enough for sharing. We had the homemade chips and the bonfire fries (topped similarly to the bonfire burger, but the jalapenos were deep fried and they were covered in a peppery cheese sauce). A vegetarian friend was dining with us and asked the server if the specialty burgers could be made with veggie patties, and the server said absolutely. My friend remarked that the patty was so good she really felt like she was eating an actual burger. While many burger places tend to scoff at vegetarians, the Rail was more than accommodating, and should not be counted out even by those who don't eat meat.  Service was friendly and fast and the manager was stopping by almost every table, which is nice to see.   I look forward to returning to rail and trying some of the other burger specials, crafted mixed drinks, and maybe an alcohol-spiked milkshake."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie... this place took me by surprise. It definitely has a modern downtown feel for being in the suburb (in decor and price)! The decor is very modern with huge chalkboards with specials and beers on tap. I don't know who writes on it, but their handwriting is phenomenal! I ordered the Local Yokel, \"naked\" with no cheese and onion rings as a side. I ordered it Medium per the suggestions of others that they tend to undercook slightly, and it came out perfect with a full pink center. Can't complain about the perfectly cooked fried egg and thick.cut.bacon. In case you didn't get it the first time, it is delicious THICK.CUT.BACON. That was by far the best part of the burger. I did notice that everyone else in the party got a dill pickle with their burger, except for me. Not sure if it should have been included or not, but nonetheless, I was happily stuffed with my burger and side of onion rings. My only complaint is that they are high-priced... my meal was $15 for just a burger and side of onion rings. The burger was good and cooked perfectly, but it's not unique and noteworthy enough to earn that price point."}
{"text":"Awesome! All locally grown food with local brews. Fantastic burger! Our family of 6 loved it though a little pricey, definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I'd officially like to give The Rail 4.5 stars, but that's not an option.  I very much enjoy the food here.  Since they opened, I've gone here about once a month with my \"work wife\" and we used to get our own burger, and then split an order of the truffle fries.  Now, we each get our own order of truffle fries.  TRY THE TRUFFLE FRIES!  I've never experienced any problems with my burgers being over or under-done.  The servers here have always been very friendly and fast.  The only thing I'd have to deduct a star (or half star) for is the seating arrangements, as many others have mentioned.  I haven't been in since they got new bar stools, so I can't speak to that.  However, I agree that the \"community table\" is weird and has got to go.  I would not want to sit that close to people I don't know.  And the seats at that table are barstool-ish, with nowhere to hang your coat or purse.  As long as I can continue to get seated at a normal table and the food continues to be good, I will be back again and again.  With Metro Burger closing (*tear*) this is pretty much it for sit-down burger joints in Summit County!"}
{"text":"The place has a clean trendy/sports feel.  Our waiter was friendly and attentive.  We both had burgers, which were very tasty, they proclaim its local.  The meat was cooked perfectly.  The prices are a little high (my burger was $11.00), and is served by itself.  Everything is a la carte, which adds up quickly.  Between two of us, with fried pickles, onion rings, and two burgers=$37.00. I feel you are paying more for the quality of beef (I am very sensitive to overly-fatty beef, which makes me feel nauseated, but after eating my sandwich I felt fine!). I have eaten at all the other burger joints...and this one by far is the best!"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST burgers around. Truffle fries are awesome. Service is ALWAYS A+++. That's why we leave 30-40% tips here!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here yesterday, while the service was great the food just didn't do much for me.  We had the fried pickles as an appetizer then I had the tourist sub veggie burger as my entree, and we shared some fries with Sriracha and cheese. The fried pickles weren't breaded very well.  My veggie burger was just kind of bland and mushy. The fries were drenched in Sriracha, not what I really expected.    Everything is fresh and The burgers are made with local beef.  Next time I will get a burger and a milkshake!  Everything looked awesome but I wasn't in the meat eating mood so that's probably where I went wrong.  I'll try it out again next time at Summit Mall."}
{"text":"The service is always excellent and the food superb. Comfortable darkened atmosphere. Not a place I'd take little kids."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant. The staff is all very friendly. Fries are wonderful, especially the bonfire fries. The burgers are cooked the way you asked every time."}
{"text":"I avoided visiting The Rail, due to the amount of negative reviews on here. I don't know what possessed me to even do that. I'm someone who rarely follows reviews. If a reviewer hates a movie, chances are i'll love it (and vice versa). So I decided to finally visit The Rail, which is in close proximity to my house.  On my first visit, I got the 7th Heaven burger, which was topped with onion jam, truffle butter, and bacon. First of all, the burger is the juciest, leanest, perfectly cooked burger i've had locally, period. I lovelove burgers, and this one is one I wanted to jump into a steamy affair with. On my second visit, i tried the Bruschetta burger. The toppings were meh at best (i was hoping for large pieces of basil and tomato, instead it was topped with a pico de gallo style bruschetta topping). But still, the burger was amazing!  And the truffle fries. Oh man, those truffle fries. They're worth every penny of their $6.75 menu price. I honestly don't eat much in the way of fried foods, though, so when I do, i want top notch fried goodies.  The wait time on both visits was great (i made both visits on Saturdays, too). We never waited more than 20 minutes for a table. On our first visit, we were invited to sit at the bar while we waited on our table, and we were able to make our food order at the bar. so, once our table was available, our wait for food wasn't very long. The manager is very friendly, and I believe is running a very good operation. I'm sure there are times where the wait is longer, but on both of my weekend visits, I had no complaints.  The prices are high, but for the quality of the food, I have no problem with paying the extra price. I personally like these burgers better than any burger i've had at B Spot or Flipside, and they're a heck of a lot closer to home for me."}
