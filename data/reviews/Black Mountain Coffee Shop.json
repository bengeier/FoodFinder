{"text":"Great place with superb service. Came up for breakfast and had chorizo and eggs with terrific hash browns. Wife had made to order omelet which was huge and The home fries great. Family is all in working and provides great service. Very clean would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great old skool place. I've been coming here for breakfast off and on for 16 years.  Warning: they don't got skillet specials, they don't got crepes.  What they have is good old fashioned Bacon and eggs, biscuits and gravy and cinnamon rolls that barely fit in the to-go box. It all smacks of homemade goodness. The woman that served us has been the same person over the years, she is friendly and attentive so the coffee never grows cold. $20 for 2 orders of eggs/meat/potatoes/biscuits and gravy/cinnamon bun can't be beat. Rolling through Cave Creek makes me a little sad these days, nothing but a tourist trap now, but the BMCS was here way back when there were nothing but cowboys around.  The biscuits and gravy are awesome, get the cinnamon roll to go because It's FRIGGIN UGE! Nice ambiance and view as well. Don't pass it up."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast this morning at Black Mountain. Good prices and incredibly great service from Theresa. Love sitting on the porch. Love when my order comes hot fresh and exactly what I ordered. Great coffee and even flavored cream!"}
{"text":"Really liked everything about it ... the food. The friendly competent service. The view and they have the best burnt onions for omelets and on hamburgers"}
{"text":"We've been going to this restaurant for yeas! Great food, good service and nice outdoor eating also."}
{"text":"*Under new owners* Seavice was great, food was exceptional! Get the 49er if you're there for lunch. If not, try the Mountaineer, there's more food than anyone can eat. Coffee delicious (; Can't wait for a trip back!!"}
{"text":"Quick friendly service. The place is a little tight bit the coffee and omelette were great. We will for sure be back"}
{"text":"The name \"coffee shop\" doesn't do this place justice. Great food, from the eggs to the kale salad our whole party loved their food. Then we ordered a desert made of a chocolate muffin with cinnamon frosting. So good. And the location is perfect for a little sightseeing in Carefree. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The place had a good feel. Great food and only outdoor seating. I had a short stack and bacon and let's say it filled me up I could not even move. The pancakes were about 10-13 inches wide and in length. It was about 3cm thick. Other wise it was good food and with a nice classic diner feeling with the enjoyment of the out doors."}
{"text":"When we stopped in today for the first time, everything went wonderfully! I ordered the breakfast sandwich w/sausage and the cinnamon roll. All our food came out at the same time within 10 minutes of placing our order. The food was hot and tasty, the service was great, and we were satisfied and ready to leave in thirty minutes. When the weather is nice, remember to sit outside on the patio!"}
{"text":"I called with a simple question and was very put off by the extremely rude attitude that i received by the lady who answered the phone. She wouldn't answer my question and as i was speaking, she interrupted me and hung up. I can guarantee that I will be telling everyone that I know how I was treated and recommend that they NEVER visit or support this company in any way."}
{"text":"Sehr zu Empfehlen. Auch für Frühaufsteher ;-) Leckere Kuchen uns kleinere Snaks zu einen sehr guten Preis! Mitten im Spanish Village gelegen. Sehr schöner Innenhof. Sehr nette Bediehnungen/Belegschaft."}
{"text":"Black Mountain Coffee Shop in Spanish Village near the Sundial in Carefree, AZ. is a fantastic ma and pa type restaurant.  I've been going there for breakfast and lunch since the 70's and it is so good that you'll see many of the same people there day after day after day.  I LOVE the breakfasts, the food comes out smokin\" hot in large portions and good quality.  These guys can really cook!  Fast and efficient servers and moderate prices make this a good value for your buck.  You'll never find a more personable owner than Shelly and she really keeps this place on the A+ level.  Don't miss out on this, it's great!! Russ C, Carefree, AZ."}
{"text":"We came in for brunch close to closing time--but the staff were welcoming and friendly. The restaurant was clean and tidy. Food was tasty and portions were generous. We had the French toast and pancakes. There were minor errors with our order which were corrected promptly. Our server was very attentive and friendly. Overall a nice place!"}
{"text":"Great service.  Basic menu.  I loved being able to have breakfast or lunch (both served all day).  We came back twice for a reliable breakfast from friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Food was disappointing. Hash browns were pre-formed, like the kind you get from McDonalds. I don't understand how this place has such high marks. Maybe it's gone downhill recently. I don't recommend."}
{"text":"The four of us had a wonderful breakfast on their outdoor patio. The august 31st temperature is a cool 85 degrees.  Great coffee, home fries, and biscuits!  The gravy is great for the biscuits, but they are a little too proud of their gravy when it comes to price."}
{"text":"Tucked in the little town of Carefree in the Spanish Village, you could blink and miss the Black Mountain Coffee Shop, but you won't miss the aroma of the fresh food wafting out the door. On a beautiful Sunday morning, sitting on the patio was a real treat!  Oh, how I wanted to order a cinnamon roll, but it just isn't on my diet . . . so I ordered my old standby, an omelet with mushrooms, a side of rye toast and the breakfast potatoes. (Not really on my diet either!) Where other restaurants might have charged upwards of $10 for that breakfast, BMCS charged a mere $6.75 . . . a bargain which made my meal even tastier! Hubby had the Grubsteak, a plate piled high with chicken fried steak, potatoes, two eggs and instead of the usual biscuits, an english muffin. That, too, was made even more delicious by the $7.95 price tag.  It looks like they cater to quite a few regulars as people were coming and going, chatting up the waitresses, carrying out boxes, etc.   Black Mountain Coffee Shop has a real neighborhood friendly appeal, and the coffee was good, and cheap! Refills were a little slow, but it was an especially busy morning as it was the last day of the Art and Wine Festival.   We've got to go back just to try the biscuits and cinnamon rolls -- when I'm ready to splurge!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the family who owns it is very friendly and willing to please. It was a very clean and inviting Cafe. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Great breakfast/brunch or lunch location. Food and service can't be beat. Biscuits and gravy is outstanding, truly homemade."}
{"text":"Great historic location! Family owned and operated. Fabulous food! Outdoor and dog friendly area too. I take all my guests here for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Great menu and location in Carefree. Black Mountain coffee has a full selection of breakfast and lunch entrées. I'm telling all of my friends and the service is great as well."}
{"text":"First time back since remodel.   Staff was very friendly and the food was great.  Had the chicken salad sandwich on sourdough with potato salad, excellent!  My wife had pancakes, eggs, and bacon which was good too.  I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"This has become our favorite place for Breakfast! The service is fantastic, as well as the food  (especially the made to order extra crispy bacon!) .I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast due to Outstanding Chef Gonzo! He prepares egg orders superbly.  Try your eggs over medium well, BASTED! It melts in your mouth. Excellente! Friendly ambience created by Don and Lisa, the great owners. Staff energy contagious. Great Gathering place .However, may need to  keep the staff hopping with providing regular blend coffee and water refills since one cup is never enough.  I definitely and highly recommend eating here. You won't go away hungry. And, all the food entrees are delightful & delicious! Make Black Mountain Restaurant Your Place! They have also added a special  coffee barista service ...espresso, cold brews, etc."}
{"text":"This is quite a wonderful place.  Breakfast on the patio this morning was awesome. Great food yummy!!!!  cinnamon rolls and biscuits to die for Spanish omelet with home fries. Doesn't get any better than that"}
{"text":"All their food is comfort breakfast food!  If you want comfort, come here!  If you want some fancy Scottsdale boutique for entitled people don't waste your time (or ours).  Every time we've been here (for 30 years plus, including the new owners) it's always been pretty darn good.  And pretty darn good is exceptional when put in context to the sea of mediocrity.  We always enjoy our breakfast and the prices are quite reasonable."}
{"text":"We loved this place before new owners took it over.  Prices were raised and portions are smaller.  Plus, the waitresses were friendlier and more experienced! We arrived at 9:45, took them 15 minutes to acknowledged us before we got something to drink.  After ordering, 20 minutes later,  the waitress told us several times our food would be out.  Customers who had sat down after us were receiving their meals before us!  Evidently, she forgot to put our order in.  I requested another glass of water which she brought 15 minutes later, we had no Silverware which I had to request.  45 minutes after placing our order she finally brought it out COLD!!  She blamed it on the Cook!!!  This was the worst $40.00 experience we have ever had for a Breakfast!!  Normally, we spend around $28.00-$30.00 at this place when the previous owners had it.  We ordered the same amount of food but paid about $10.00 more.  We paid in cash so we didn't have to wait another 30 minutes to get our credit card back.  Needless to say, we won't be going back unless we order something very simple like their Cinnamon Rolls and we do not get that same waitress!!  4-13-2017"}
{"text":"We have been here for 5 days and had breakfast or lunch here 3 days in a row. Great little patio,  nice menu variety.  Good coffee,  could be a tad stronger. Service is quick and friendly. My son has the French Toast,  my other kid gets cereal,  my husband loves the chicken fried steak (gravy is unique), and I've had simply eggs and fruit once and the kale salad with chicken (vinaigrette was really good). Definitely will become our go to breakfast place on our future visits."}
{"text":"Came here with my family and then again with my boyfriend. Both times the food was great and the service was on top of it! Awesome atmosphere, family owned and run! Definitely a place to try!"}
{"text":"Just OK, nothing special.  I found it amusing that a place that calls itself Black Mountain COFFEE SHOP has little baskets of those plastic creamer cups on the tables.  Put in a little effort, guys, or call yourself Black Mountain DINER."}
{"text":"Cute place!  HUGE portions!  The cinnamon roll was AMAZING according to my daughter.  The pancakes were so huge that even my teenage son couldn't finish.  The biscuits and gravy were \"different\".  It wasn't bad, I just didn't like it.  They used ham or something other than sausage.  The over medium eggs were cooked to perfection, as was the bacon-and what a generous portion of bacon it was!  The biscuits were fluffy.  It was an excellent value! The 4 of us ate like kings for 25 bucks!  If you try this place.....cash or check only.  Thank goodness I had my checkbook.  I will definitely return.  Oh and the waitress and staff were very nice. Doggies are welcome too!  They even had treats for them!  My kids really liked it too."}
{"text":"What a great spot to catch breakfast or lunch.  The owners are friendly and run a great restaurant!  The staff is excellent also, serving delicious, hot fresh food."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service.   We love it here for good food and great coffee.  The help is wonderful and so friendly.  I recommend this place to anyone.  Gina and I love it here!!!"}
{"text":"Under new owners.... This place has exceptional food and staff.  They have gluten free pancakes and French toast which is a great option for my son and I. This will definitely be a place we frequent on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Very friendly little cafe/ coffee shop.. the biscuits and gravy were delicious! Outdoor patio was really cute. Perfect place for a quick, quaint breakfast in carefree."}
{"text":"Such a nice little breakfast place! Last time I came was awhile back but our server was super sweet (Camryn I think?) and the food was great. Really, really good  biscuits and gravy. The blueberry muffin and cinnamon roll were both so delicious. Great service and food, highly recommend if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Worst place I have ever eaten. We ordered the steak and eggs breakfast, and the steak was completely raw, and we asked for medium raw. The stake was the only thing half eaten and we brought the attention to the waitress just to let the establishment know. We didn't expect to have the steak replaced. The owner came over and automatically assumed that we wanted a free meal, but we told her we just wanted to let her know for future health safety. She told us she will give us 50% off next time we come, but we asked to use the coupon now since none of us lived there. She said no and argued with us. We were about to pay for the meal when she came back and said \"the whole meal is free, just leave and never come back.\" She had the WORST  customer service. We just wanted the one steak and eggs to be 50% off and pay for the rest. I never felt so guilty just to bring up a simple, easy to resolve issue.  The steak was a food safety issue because the steak may have been thawed out and refrozen for who knows how long and then reused. Or the steak could have been left out for who knows how long. If the meat was not brought to the proper temperature, it does not kill all the food borne bacteria/viruses. I am lucky I was not a child or elderly person, because I could have gotten severely sick or killed."}
{"text":"New ownership is excellent, super friendly staff and food is delicious. Will definitely be back.....tomorrow"}
{"text":"Really nice remodel! New ownership. Much needed space. Menu pretty much the same but the chef must be new. Foods not the same.  Not bad but not the same."}
{"text":"I love the vibe of this place. There were other breakfast places in the same area and not one person was in them, so we walked down to Black Mountain and it was packed and we even said \"yay people\". We walked in and everyone was really nice, they also seemed to know each other (which I love) and still welcomed my husband, baby and me. The service was ok, just in terms of getting silverware and getting our credit card run, but it kind of didn't matter, we were right by the cash register and everyone was very sweet. We talked to a few People and One very nice guy was giving us suggestions for other restaurants to try.  The food was pretty good. I liked the cinnamon roll. I didn't love the gluten free pancakes, but that's a gamble I was willing to take. I liked the coffee. My husband got Chorizo and eggs which were good, neither of us loved the beans. Again, for me, it was a 4 star meal because of the atmosphere and the food was fine. Not too expensive. I'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"Ate here on Saturday 9/2 on the way up to Bartlett Lake for lunch. The meal was only a two star, but the people there are SO nice that it warrants the third star.  The shop is really cute, just off the main thoroughfare, set back in a shopping center. It is on the small side, but there is outdoor seating for overflow and it is a pet friendly patio! It appears to be a mom and her three daughters doing the front service. They are all very friendly and the service is attentive without being overbearing. The menu is diverse enough to please majority of people. A good mix of counter seats and tables.  Was really craving a burger. This is not the place for a burger. I ordered Van's Claim medium rare - but when cooking a preformed hamburger patty from a frozen state, by the time it is thawed, the burger is already overdone. We laughed about being asked how we want it cooked when it didn't really matter because of the type of product being used. It comes with cheddar cheese, bacon and green chilies. The cheese was not melted nor was it put on the hot meat with any chance of even warming up. It was like it was almost forgotten and added at the last minute. The bacon was crisp and plentiful! The most unfortunate part of the whole burger was the green chilies - they were from a can and had that metallic taste of most canned chilies. A few minutes on the grill to char them would take that taste away and add so much to the burger. I had the creamy potato salad, and it too was a premade tub potato salad. For $10, I would expect something that I can't get at a Whataburger or Carl's Jr. There was so much potential in this meal that was just missed.  Based on the other patrons there, breakfast seems to be where they are successful. I would definitely give this restaurant a second chance - who doesn't like a good breakfast!   If you are thinking of trying this restaurant, here are my suggestions: order breakfast, order breakfast, order breakfast. Avoid steak/hamburgers if you want it any way other than well done. The pancakes look amazing! Finish the drive up to Bartlett Lake - it is very pretty up there and not very crowded!"}
{"text":"The updated interior is really clean and inviting and you can tell they put a lot of money into improving it. The exterior is the same. Cute courtyard with tables and umbrellas.  I didn't really understand if we were supposed to seat ourselves or not. The food was fine. It came out hot, and the portions were filling. They charge $3 for a side of 2 eggs. I'm not usually one to complain about price but this seems really high unless the eggs are organic which I didn't see advertised anywhere.  There were two servers working the courtyard. One was super friendly and sweet who smiled when she said hi and genuinely seemed happy to be there.  Overall, yep. It's another breakfast diner."}
{"text":"This is always my \"Go To\" place for a quality, peaceful breakfast or lunch.  These guys are quick, but consistently good and always friendly.   I've probably eaten here 7 times this month.   Never a challenge.   THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"Bad attitude from owners. Food was not great. You could tell they freeze, thaw and then re-freeze their meat because the steak was tough and unevenly cooked where half of it was not at the below edible temperature. Also-- there's no coffee bar. Never going back."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a standard- issue bacon and eggs breakfast. A freindly and efficient staff handles tables inside and out with grace and humor. Clearly the plethora of regulars speak volumes about the quality of the food and the service."}
{"text":"The place looked looked a quaint coffee shop with diner food. The kitchen seemed distracted the day we came in. Maybe they were out of things. Owner reached out, which is polite. Diner fare, burgers and fries, and a very good Arnold Palmer."}
{"text":"Great gluten free breakfast food. We had gluten free blueberry pancakes and Spanish omelette. The food came out in great time. Pancake were fluffy and tasty. Omelette was great. Waitress accidentally brought wheat toast instead of gluten free, so yikes! Be careful!"}
{"text":"I found the food and service at Black Mountain Coffee Shop to be excellent.  I enjoyed the environment which reminded me of a special coffee shop in my home town."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!!  Worst dining experience I've ever had!  Please BEWARE!  The food I received was refrigerator cold.  My steak was order medium and I received a rare bloody cold steak.  The owner/manager was rude when confronted about the cold food.  She did not want to take any responsibility for her store.  PLEASE DO NOT EAT AT THIS RESTAURANT!!!"}
{"text":"House shopping can give you a big appetite. Came into the restaurant 15 mons before closing.  Cute decor... just like mamas kitchen.  Our server we very welcoming.  She told us about to menu and gave us a couple of suggestions.  They have some nice sandwiches and salads.  Everything we ordered tasted homemade.  Nice home town vibe.  Coming to a place like this makes me more excited that I will a part of this community."}
{"text":"Nice place, good breakfast and drip coffee. But don't go here for espresso drinks, because there ain't none.  Or granola / yogurt."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Love to support small businesses.  This place is less than two miles from The Boulders Resort. I had the hash browns and egg whites and they were delicious. The biscuits and gravy are really good too!"}
{"text":"New owners, new dining room, same great food.  Wow, nice update to this neighborhood fixture. The new owners kept a lot of the same menu items and added a couple of new ones. Very good.  I will continue to support this great family run local diner. I hope they have great success."}
{"text":"Very busy and disorganized.  No WiFi.  Had to eat eggs Benedict with a spoon.  Eggs were warm but barely cooked"}
{"text":"Great breakfast food!  Small, cozy and a fun place to meet friends up in Carefree, AZ.  Seating indoors and outdoors.  There is a very small section for pets, so if you have a dog, there is a separate patio area with two small tables.  First come first serve but well worth it if Fido likes to eat with you!"}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop in carefree! We all enjoyed our meals very much. I got the veggie/cheese omelet and it was delicious! Our waitress was kind and the food came out quick! Would recommend for breakfast or lunch :)  I also bought my parents a $25 gift card to use at Black Mountain Coffee Shop. They both told me what a great experience they had dining in for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Do not go here!! We had an awful experience and it was our first time there. I am vegetarian although I have a big heart for eggs Benedict's. Theirs, however, comes with Canadian bacon on it. I simply asked our server, who knew nothing about the menu, if I could substitute avocado for the Canadian bacon. 10 minutes later another server comes out to clarify the order. After waiting for our food, and hearing other guests complain about the food, my Benedict came out with meat on it. They remade my Benedict and came out with avocado that was more bad with brown and gray spots than good. The poached eggs were poached hard instead of poached easy like any traditional benedict. I had one bite and it was mediocre at best. The male manager came over and hardly made things right. Then the female manager came over and said it was their fault. We insisted that they take the Benedict off. I don't usually complain and this is my first review on a restaurant that I have ever done. I work in the service industry and any place that has respect for their guests would have taken care of more than just the food that was bad. All of the servers there seemed completely confused/not knowing how to really take care of guests and the managers made it seem like it was an inconvenience to them that they screwed up our meal. My boyfriend got the mountaineer which he said was the worst \"classic\" breakfast he has ever had. We will most definitely not going back here because of the crappy service and disgusting, tasteless food. Go anywhere else in cave creek before you go to black mountain coffee shop."}
{"text":"The Black Mountain Coffee Shop is a great gem of a breakfast place.  Family owned and family staffed, you can't get a better place. I'm a little nervous about leaving a review and tempting the yahoos to come... So if you're a yahoo don't come here and screw it up for everyone."}
{"text":"I'm surprised more people haven't written a review for this place.  I have been eating here since I was about 11, but hadn't been here in years.  The restaurant itself is very small, but there are a lot of seats outside.  My husband had the Mountaineer that included biscuits, gravy, eggs, country fries, and a cinnamon bun.  The cinnamon bun was delicious, and hot.  There was so much frosting on top, it made my teeth hurt.  The country fries were hot, fresh and crispy.  As for the biscuits and gravy...TO.DIE.FOR.  The gravy is the best tasting gravy I have ever had.  I had a cheese and ham omelette, but wasn't impressed.  The meal was hot, but the eggs weren't fluffy and they didn't put enough cheese in the omelette.  I would eat here again, but would get the Mountaineer or just Cinnamon Bun the next time around.  The service was good, quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Vegetarian sandwich : 4/5 Grilled cheese: 3/5 Cinnamon roll : 2.5/5   Great ambience. Decent coffee."}
{"text":"We sat down at 11:00 breakfast was served at noon    We finish at 12:20 the bill came an at that point handed her my card before she got away 12:30.  My tip should have been ?????"}
{"text":"Nice little breakfast joint that is still working out the spots of being under new management. Lots of family members working here which made it a nice touch to see to support local establishments. One big negative was that we had to wait a bit because our ticket got lost in the back.   The food wasn't bad but it wasn't fantastic.  The home fries were nice and crispy but hey needed seasoning such as ranch seasoning etc to make it great.  Bacon was good and well cooked. Eggs were nice and fluffy.  The steak was properly cooked and had a great flavor. The gravy was ok but needed a little something else.  We added salt and pepper but it still needed something else to be great. The biscuits were big and good flavor.    So we will come again in a few months to see if things improved before ruling this place out."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at BMCS. The menu is comfort food--great breakfasts and lunches with all your faves like grilled cheese, patty melts, fish sandwich, great waffle fries and onion rings. Elizabeth, the amazing server, is a treasure and  why I  keep coming back! It's a diner with all the quirks and trimmings. One of the best things about Carefree, for sure. Eat here and get a taste of the local flavor."}
{"text":"We had a great lunch with great service. My sister and I had the Cobb salad (the picture was half eaten) fresh green lettuce, grilled chicken, (she added bacon) and hard boiled egg. So yummy. Might have been big enough to share. My mom got the vegetarian melt on rye. So good too. We shared crisscut fries and onion rings to die for. With our huge iced teas the bill was $47. Cute little cafe, I'm sure breakfast is good too. We'll try that next time."}
{"text":"So, I'm leaving my review at 4 stars for the moment, as I've only had one experience with the new ownership.. But I must say, I was very impressed. The interior of the restaurant is much nicer than it used to be, the menus, food presentation, etc were excellent, as were the food and service, staff were very friendly and helpful.. if I experience something similar a couple more  times, I'll be bumping things up to a '5'. Worth a visit for sure!"}
{"text":"The coffee was worse than what you would expect from a diner, which is not a high expectation to begin with. The food was also pretty bland. We had to repeatedly remind our server that we wanted water or a refill on coffee. The meal was not expensive, but I was pretty shocked that the server assumed I was going to tip her around 40% and I had to request my change."}
{"text":"Greasy spoon-style comfort food diner with mediocre weak brewed coffee, but great service and a cute patio.  A few healthy options, like raw kale, to add to the omelets, but I wouldn't come expecting high-end dining.  I agree with the other reviewers that the service and the location bring this up from a 2-star."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the fuss is about. Weak coffee, dry biscuits, and flavorless gravy.   If you're not a regular you will wait longer than necessary for service. Food does come out ridiculously fast though.  I actually waited longer for service than my food once I placed my order.  Cash or check only"}
{"text":"We have been going here for years.  We just found there is a new owner, and the quality of food is identical.  EXCELLENT!  Friendly waitress and staff were attentive even while EVERY table was full!  Food was piping hot and tasty and good portions for reasonable price.  It is my opinion this is the best place for breakfast in the area.  After talking to the previous owner about cleanliness, I am convinced this place is clean in the back kitchen as well.  They take pride in ownership.  Give it a try.  Eating outside in the courtyard is a treat."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast restaurant tucked away in the corner in Carefree Az!  The wife and I stopped by after a quick hike up Pinnacle Peak.  The service was very good and the food was delicious.  They have a choice of inside dining or outside patio.  Patio is well  shaded and sort of has a Spanish flair to it.  We will be returning for sure.  Kudos to our waitress, very attentive and took good care of us."}
{"text":"Came here out of frustration with the non-existent service at Palo Verde at the Boulders Resort this morning.  What a difference.  Much better breakfast with great service at half the price.  Glad the Boulders forced me into trying Black Mountain Coffee Shop!"}
{"text":"Have lived in cave creek 20 yrs. This is the only place we like for breakfast/ lunch in the area. Most of our neighbors prefer Blk Mtn too. Quite reasonable compared to others, and not outstanding, but plain good food at a good price.  outdoor seating a definite plus. We always take out of town guests here and have had no complaints, just compliments."}
{"text":"Had a great!!!!!! Cheesesteak sandwich. Like the variety of menu items (for even the pickiest diner) get breakfast any time! Soda pop served in cans, with a glass of ice."}
{"text":"Haven't been here since new owners and renovation. It's awesome!  Stopped coming and didn't know it changed."}
{"text":"Nice little coffee shop in an out of the way place, what a treat. I had a wonderful lunch which reminded me of my grandmothers cooking. I really enjoyed the meal. Friendly, professional service in a clean, comfortable atmosphere. Restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating. Try it, you might like it."}
{"text":"Seriously, this is GOOOOOOD.  We came here after being at work/on site from 3 AM til 1 PM, and this reallllllly hit the spot.  My colleagues had the grilled cheese and a burger, and I had the spanish omelette and subbed cottage cheese for the potatoes/bread.  Even their house coffee and tea were amazing.    We had a sweet waitress who explained she was a bit new, but she didn't miss a thing!  We scarfed our food down but she kept the hot coffee refills coming.  For a comfort food place, I was excited that they had more than just half and half for creamers (flavors like vanilla and caramel).  Stop in, sit on the patio, enjoy the coffee, and relax a little."}
{"text":"Wasn't clean and flies all over the place. Placed an order for wife but I don't think their customer service is that great. Lady wasn't that friendly."}
{"text":"Great Chicago-style restaurant. My wife had a patty melt which was perfectly prepared. Very tasty and a nice sized burger. I had the \"Chicagoan\", which is an Italian beef sandwich. It came dipped and with giardiniera peppers, just the way I like it. The sandwich filled the whole plate and was delicious! However, the au jus was really, really salty. Both sandwiches came with delicious waffle fries.   The service was good and everyone was really friendly. The inside - and outside - was very clean, which I personally appreciate. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Cute place, atmosphere wise, and friendly staff.  A LOT of regulars here.  Beyond those two factors though, it's just an average meal.  Biscuits were dense and chewy, and homefries seem homemade.  Prices fair for the area.  Parking is ok, but seating is very limited, especially in summer months."}
{"text":"Wonderful little cafe.  Great food, excellent service and in a perfect location.   I had the omelet which was divine...it comes with wonderful breakfast potatoes and I opted for the biscuit which was good ...not my momma's , but definitely one of the best \"restaurant\" biscuits ever."}
