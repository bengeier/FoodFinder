{"text":"Normally my fianc√© and I love this place but last night our experience was so terrible that I doubt we will return any time soon! First off I felt like we had gone back in time to a high school dance! All of the waitresses were paying more time chatting about the boy working in the kitchen then checking on their guests! Second we ordered the homemade chips and salsa! Let me tell you the chips were definitely from a bag or they were old! Their was nothing homemade about them! And last but not least we normally visit this place for their delicious wings but they were far from delicious this time! The wings were not cooked all the way and were missing the sauces! After it took 20 minutes to get our waitresses attention,
we decided to get them to go and ended up cooking them ourselves at home! Poor experience will also share this with family who visits frequently!"}
{"text":"We are often in this area for Hartwood Acres events, but never stopped here until  this week, and are soo glad we took a chance! It wasn't too risky actually since we saw a nice review on Yelp! (Just joined, it's GREAT!)  

Very nice  decor for a Pub type place, warm and friendly.  Great varied menu from unusual and interesting appetizers, tons of sandwiches! which is what we wanted for an early dinner. All done in interesting combos of breads, and unique touches.  My hubby got his all time go-to Philly Steak, loaded with steak, onion, peppers, cheese on a nice Torpedo roll, not your standard huge dry Hoagie bun.  I got the Roast beef, served on Twisted Rye, nice quality beef, lots of cheddar, I skipped the red peppers and horseradish and it was still fantastic. They came with home made chips, awesome, not greasy, and I up dreaded to sweet potato fries $2 - excellent, sprinkled with cinnamon! Huge portion! 

This will be our standard place to eat now in that area!"}
{"text":"The food has been subpar. I've thrown out too many meals here. I'd stick with the french dip or something else that's hard to screw up. Even then, I don't know how you make such a lousy waffle sundae. The atmosphere is casual and boisterous. The liquor selection is decent. The bartenders are pretty inconsistent with their attentiveness. All in all, the only reason I ever go here is that all other options are closed."}
{"text":"Sat down at a table in the bar area. Waited 20 minutes. Not one person said a word to me. This was at 11:30PM on a Saturday night. While the place was fairly busy, most parties were wrapping up. There were plenty of empty tables around me. I was sitting at a corner table next to a server station. I was somewhat amused at the lack of service initially. As time went on, I became frustrated and just decided to leave. Oh well. Never again."}
{"text":"I did not expect much going to a bar, but they served an out of date beer, grossly overcooked the wings to the point they were inedible and their deep fried pickles were ridiculously soggy."}
{"text":"Wow we had several great dinners. prime rib excellent,  bolognese sauce excellent and only $10 , astounding waitress 5 star overall"}
{"text":"Very good bar food, I would recommend the blue cheese and bacon burger. The service was a little absent at lunch, and the place wasn't that full. Besides that I would be back."}
{"text":"You can actually consider this bar and grill an excellent family place to dine. We take our family (which includes our 2 year old) there all of the time. Fries and chips are FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"The burgers are delicious! We are hooked and have been back 3 more times in the past month. Salads are great, the specials are amazing. We've always had outstanding service. Seems to get a popular bar crowd, so no wait for dining and the food comes really promptly. So far we haven't had a dish we haven't liked!"}
{"text":"Decent food and service.   Nice happy hour selection.   Would be better if happy hour was applied in the restaurant section as well so those dining with kids could enjoy.   White pizza is very good.   Would recommend for a casual dinner."}
{"text":"New ownership has brought some spice and flavor into the area with the \"feel\" and the eats. Colossal sized salads. Awesome wings. The best veggie pizza around. Huge menu with nice sandwich selection but also some specialty dishes with pasta or fish and other selections that have never failed to please. I haven't a bad experience yet, and seem to order different things with my gang three or four times a month. Great place for lunch, dinner or happies with an outdoor fire pit and a cabana with volleyball court. Highly recommended for pub fare. Reasonable prices for such big portions. Side note: The place does an awesome job with catering orders and is very reasonable."}
{"text":"I go here a lot because it's close and this place is definitely going down hill. The food is good but the service is really bad and extremely unattentive. It's almost worse when it's less crowded because the waitstaff are generally content to stand in the corner and chit-chat than check in on customers. My #1 biggest pet peeve is that the business hours are completely arbitrary. I have shown up many times well within the advertised business hours and the place will be closed. Very frustrating."}
{"text":"Gators is a great casual restaurant with good food and good beer. They always have craft beer on tap. The wings are amazing."}
{"text":"We found Gator's Grille on our way home from the Indian Pow Wow in Dorseyville PA. This was right down the road. I wish we lived a little closer because we'd always be ordering food for takeout or eating inside. It is only about 20 min. from Pittsburgh. First off, the place is really cute, to me it felt like it was a restaurant you'd go to while on vacation at a beach. The whole place obviously revolves around alligators and there's a bunch of decorations that are alligators. The place is very clean and the booths are spacious, the bathrooms weren't spotless but most public bathrooms aren't. Our waitress was pretty friendly and made sure our drinks were always filled. She actually gave us a pitcher of pop we could keep at our table to refill our drinks. She checked on us the perfect amount of times, she didn't constantly stop and again she wasn't annoying by coming every 10 seconds. I will most definitely go back to Gator's Grill!!"}
{"text":"Good bar food clean and kid friendly big portions. Waitress was a little slow but very nice. I will eat here again"}
{"text":"Decent food. Great service. The philly cheese steak is dry and the hot salad does not come with meat. Adding salmon is $4!!! 
The French onion soup was really good.
Atmosphere is a sports bar.
We went at 4 on a Saturday evening and it wasn't crowded at all it was just something convenient and close. I probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Great service, good food. Expensive for what it is. I had the Seven Napkin Burger, which held true to its name.

The place is always packed, very lively atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food. Great prices.  Great service.  Will be back! The French Dip was awesome.  Also have a great beer selection."}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch today. I ordered 3 wings with hot ranch and an order of buffalo shrimp.
Both were very good. I wanted to order a 2nd order of shrimp. I suggest getting the shrimp plain and getting hot ranch or just hot buffalo for dipping."}
{"text":"Brendan knew this place growing up as JD's. We came for lunch to revisit and hesitated seeing it was now Gator's. We were not disappointed! Hot Salad is delicious. Gracious service."}
{"text":"I sooo love this place.  I love even more that I live within 10 minutes of it.  I have never had anything I didn't like.  My favorites include the hot vegetable salad w/ salmon, the crab stuffed Portobello salad, sweet potato fries, pulled pork nachos and any of their flat bread.  

Only once have I had mediocre service when my girlfriends and I went out for dinner and drinks and our whacky waitress completely disregarded ANY request any of us made for our orders.. LOL. kind of weird but whatever.  Still love it. Still come here regularly.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped in Friday night with a couple of friends and sat at the bar. Service was very slow and the bartender was not to happy. We ordered food wings and BLT's. The uneaten wings that were on the bar should have been a warning when we sat down. Everything was extremely greasy and not very good. I would not go back."}
{"text":"This place is always packed with locals for a reason. Great food, great relaxed/sporty atmosphere, and great service."}
{"text":"Work is the curse of the drinking classes. - Oscar Wilde (I wish I could claim it!)

I like this place very much.   Don't mistake the A-OK Rating.  While the food is good - this is not like some of my other experiences I had (compare to FatHead's, Burgatory, Meat and Potatoes, etc...)   

My favorite go to food:  Barbalo Wings (BBQ / Buffalo)
My favorite Sandwich:  Fish
My favorite Shot:  Jameson - neat
My favorite Beer (at Gator's formerly JD's):  Stella

This place is a fun Happy Hour Place and a good venue to watch sports.   I will be back and do my best to create some shenanigans.

7/6/12 - Update:

I am upgrading this review because of the fun factor has been raised.    The outdoor patio is complete (huge fireplace).   I have ventured up to the Cantina where they have outdoor volleyball.    I enjoy the beer specials.

This place is pretty fun.   

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"What a business plan, putting a swimming pool right as you pull into the parking lot!... One can only assume that is the plan for that giant crater that is waiting for you as soon as you pull into the parking lot. Now you will have to drive around the pool construction to get to a parking space, but think bigger picture here.

The food is good except our onion straws came completely unseasoned. The wings aren't bad, above average compared to other places in the Burgh. 

The service on the other hand was absurd, now bare with me here... please remember that Breanna, our waitress, can only provide the service that management allows, after all she was trained by someone in management, I hope.

The saga... Ordered ICED tea, came with 3 cubes of melted ice... That is ok, a lot of places make that mistake because the brewed tea is kept room temperature. But when you ask for a glass of ice behind it and that glass arrives less than half full, the excuses end here... Sure the bartender has some blame here, but if what a bartender does effected my tips, I would have had her redo it... Besides I ordered a refill of that now infamous iced tea and it came the same way (counted the ice cubes on one finger) with no accompanying half full glass of ice. Add to it that both me and my wife ordered finger foods, you would think that we wouldn't have had to ask for napkins, let alone bring us 4 when we did.

Being in the customer service industry, I know how hard it is to get good help, but as a business owner, once you put that person on the floor by themselves, you are saying to the consumer that his/her performance is YOUR standard of service... That standard will be your triumph or your demise, it's all on you!"}
{"text":"Pretty good bar food and drink selection. Prices are great. Good sports bar atmosphere with a restaurant attached. Worth checking out for a burger, sandwich, or wings."}
{"text":"A great local watering hole with very good bar food. It has a great area that is separated by a wall for family dining. The bar area gets crowded and is often not really family friendly. Their wings are awesome and there's plenty of TV's. The outside area has a fireplace and of course that's a plus. During the summer they have horseshoe pits and other games and leagues for these games but I have never been to that area. It's up the hill on Saxonburg. The only down side is that it's a clean restaurant but not incredibly clean but that's your call I still go back fairly often."}
{"text":"Been back to gators several times over the past few years. Food has differed each time from good to average. Food wont WoW you but it is still pretty good. Pizza is good. Inferno burger is yummy. Buffalo chicken wrap also pretty good. Have been disppointed by the wings but it may just be my personal preference."}
{"text":"Decent local joint.  Above average beer selection and a decent menu.  The wings are pretty darn good. Crispy skin every time.  The side salad is a great compliment as well as the fried cheese.  Service is prompt and courteous, and overall the wait staff helped move the meal at a quicker pace due to our kid who is almost 2 can only sit still for s limited amount of time."}
{"text":"I went to gators today for lunch my friend in our two little kids.we ordered two salads and two child chicken tenders and was there for an hour and a half waiting for our food. The service was absolutely horrendous! We were the only table in the whole restaurant and only about 5 people at the bar. Completely unacceptable especially for someone with little kids!! On top of all of this, the salad I had was pretty bad. We never received an apology from the waitress or anything for the amount of time we were there. I will never return to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Only beach volley ball courts in the Burgh that I know of.  They're often free. Someone should start a league even if it's a one hand beer league with beach balls and beers allowed on the court.  

This place has really good, locally sourced food, a huge projection set in their Tiki hut for steelers, and most importantly, a fantastic slatherrring sauce mr GZ's for your wings, ribs, coleslaw, ice cream.  It even makes iron city taste better if you don't over do it with me G'zs.

Try their VFW burger contest created burgers!  They have I believe a Sharpsburger, Shalor, aspinwall, and possibly Deer lakes? Burger.  I'll update the list the next time I'm there which may be in about 10 minutes. Watch for the VFW burger contest which a % of each burger sale going to the VFW's.  I believe it is in Spring!"}
{"text":"Ordered a special, but was the best vegan option in the area.  If you can find the black bean tacos on the menu, order them!  Even if you don't eat vegan, the tacos are incredible.  Hoping they get put on the menu permanantly."}
{"text":"This place is lame. We don't go here. Only good for beer and bro lunch. I thought I ordered safe for bar food, but was completely let down by the pulled pork and coleslaw. Bun was terrible coleslaw had very weird taste to it. I would only go back to drink if a friend really needed me."}
{"text":"This grille truly defines the phrase \"hidden gem!\" We stumbled upon this place after going to a local pow wow and couldn't be happier with the service, food, and look of Gator's Grille! We ordered the alligator bites appetizer in buffalo sauce, which was absolutely wonderful! The alligator meat was chewy, but it was unique and very good tasting, definitely worth the $10! We also ordered nacho mama nachos which were fresh tasting, although I would not order them again because they were bland and didn't have much toppings. The drinks come out in mason type jars, which is such a cute, fun touch! The booths are tall and the dining area wasn't busy so I felt like I really had privacy even though the bar in the other room was filled! I ordered the buffalo chicken pizza (4 large cuts for $9) & it was great! It tasted more like a gourmet buffalo chicken flat bread! The chicken was quality meat, and they put just the right amount of ingredients on it to make it a perfect blend of ranch, buffalo sauce, cheese, crust, seasonings and chicken! We waited a little longer for our food (20-25 min), but it let's you know they are making everything fresh! The bathrooms aren't the cleanest and there were some files buzzing around, which was annoying, but I give this place 5 stars even with that being said because the service is great, the food is unique and is reasonably priced for the amount they give you! The alligator theme is fun and the inside is really cute! Can't wait to go again and try their Oktoberfest beers and meals!"}
{"text":"Awful. Provolone cheese wheel was a slice of deli cheese, heavily breaded, and deep fried. Inedible."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! Never heard of this place til I came across it in a magazine and the next day I came here to check it out. The service was excellent. The staff was so down to earth. Large beer selection and very affordable food menu. Started off with an order of the alligator bites which were so unique then for dinner i ordered the special, lobster Mac n cheese which had andouille sausage in it, also very unique! The parking situation was kind of tight but I will definitely be back to check out the outside section which has sand and volleyball! How cool is that!"}
