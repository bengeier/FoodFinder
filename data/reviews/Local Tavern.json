{"text":"We ate dinner here on Tuesday evening and had an absolutely wonderful meal!  Ordered the shroom french fries which were very, very good but oh so filling.  One could eat these as a meal and be totally satisified.  We tried three different burgers and they all were very, very good.  I had the burger special of the evening and it was cooked to perfection.  After all the fries I could only eat half but it was just as good warmed up the next day.  There is no children's menu but our server was very helpful in making suggestions as to what would be good choices for the kids to share.  The portions are quite hearty, so there certainly was enough food to share.  They ordered the wings and what a good choice that was.  I never order wings as they are usually to fatty or greasy for my taste.  Not the wings here---they are the best I have ever tasted.  It was like eating very good fried chicken.  They were huge and once again, cooked to perfection.  Service was very good and very friendly.  We left full and looking forward to a return visit.  It is always a treat to discover such a good place to eat!!   Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I have been to the Local Tavern in Willoughby and decided to check out the new location in Mentor. The place was pretty big and the decorations in and out were lovely. I did not order any food but I hear the mac n cheese is amazing. I did go out and sit on the patio to have a couple drinks with my friend. The patio was great! Also the staff was very friendly. It was like going to an old friends house ... very inviting and welcoming. The location was very busy while my friend and I were there but that made it fun! The only thing I'd recommend is they build a larger parking lot! It's tough  finding parking after 6pm."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  Best place in Mentor to have a good beer and good food!  Must try the shroom fries!   Exceptional customer service!  Will continue to frequent here, as long as they permit me. Big special thanks to Kristen and Kasey!  They are the best!!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down one if top bar and restaurants in Cleveland. If you haven't been there treat yourself soon."}
{"text":"Yummy food and fun atmosphere! Prices are pretty decent. It's the best place to get sea food in Lake Co."}
{"text":"We've been here before and not been overwhelmed with the food or the service,  but today was the last straw. 

What restaurant doesn't have a high chair? Really?  
You are a restaurant,  not a bar. 
Perhaps we should ask Mentor to look into whether you're really a restaurant.
Last time here."}
{"text":"We enjoy this place everytime.  The food and service is very good.  We brought the family there Monday night. The cheese bomb fries should be illegal. ...um yum!!!  $5 for an excellent burger and fries  (current Monday night special.)

Little devils are tiny bites of heaven.  Their wings are crispy and delishous,  sauce on the side.

I hope they stay around for many years to come.  Fed the family for $40.  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Not ready for prime time.
With the competition in the area the owner needs to step up his managing.
We ate at the patio. There were long intervals without staff at the patio. Our wine was poured but sat at the bar while waiting for the waitress to come back and serve.
First the bar keep could have served the wine to the table or since it was only 2 wines, do the pour immediately so the waitress could serve to the table.  I saw a couple come in and sit down for 6 minutes, no waitress approached them so they got up and left.  Even a trained monkey can take an order and serve it.  But it take attentive staff on the floor taking care of business to make a new business excell.  Two young women were seated of one which was an off duty employee.  They got more attention from the wait staff than the other customers.

All in all not bad, however The Firehouse and Wright Place and other nearby places will still get my business before I try this place again."}
{"text":"Bomb diggity bomb. Everything was fresh and excellently prepared. It's hard to find quality seafood in the Midwest and this place nails it.  The blue points were on point. I am looking forward to eating my way through this menu. Back to my Christmas ale. Cheers!"}
{"text":"The fresh tomato salad is great! If you're a cheese lover, you will be pleasantly surprised by lots and lots of little mozzarella balls. I'd love to come back to try some of their stuffed burgers.

The service left something to be desired. We waited a while to be seated. We ordered two salads and then a to-go salad. We spent nearly an hour and a half there. I'll be back, but I hope the service is a bit quicker next time!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine at work had been raving about this place so one Friday a few weeks back we made the trek from downtown here for dinner.  It was definitely worth it!  The Mango martini was fantastic, but beware that it's grey goose infused with mango - there's no mango juice - these are STRONG.  They had calamari fries on special which were unbelievably good (especially because I love calamari but don't like the bodies, just the rings).  My boyfriend got chicken wings which were HUGE.  There was so much meat on them that he was full after three.  You got to pick a few dipping sauces, they didn't come sauced.  I got a twice baked potato, which was also great.  I'm sure it was 1,000 calories and had a pound of butter but in that moment, I really didn't care.  I was too full to eat it all.  

I definitely plan on heading out there again, it was great."}
{"text":"10/25/14 Update. On our third trip back we were a little disappointed. The food was still really good but the service was lacking. We arrived at 6:15 with 6 people in our party. We were told that there would be a wait of about 20-30 mins. We had our name added to the list. About 15 mins later we saw that a table for six was made and expected to be seated. Another party of six came in and was promptly seated at the newly set table. My friend asked the hostess if they took reservations. She said they didn't on the weekends (this was on a Saturday). To which I asked, \"then why was that party of six seated before us?\" The hostess said \"oh they are family friends\".  
Sorry, that's not cool and it shouldn't happen. 
We were seated about 10 mins later. We had to ask more than once for a glass of wine and it took three tries to get one of our dishes brought out. They were very busy, so I can cut some slack. But when you put it all together, it made for a disappointing night."}
{"text":"great food but the service sucked! the one in mentor is slow as balls. food was great price is not bad but go there on a Friday or Saturday night and make sure that's all your doing."}
{"text":"Very disappointed specials listed online were not available for a 6:30 dinner. Generally a good place to eat."}
{"text":"I stop here for lunch when I am passing through on business. Always friendly service at the bar, good burger, salads, crab cakes. Seared scallops were delicious as well."}
{"text":"The idea was to get as many tastes in one meal as possible, so I had the spicy chili, wings with Flaming Blue and their hottest sauce, and the Cobb Salad. 

I'm not a huge fan of breading on wings, so these were just ok for me. The really hot sauce lacked punch, but the flaming blue was really good.  The salad was loaded with bacon and blue cheese...yum!  The chili was awesome and had enough kick, definitely will order again.

There were wings and salad left over and they were good as seconds.

Service was attentive and efficient."}
{"text":"I have lunch there at least once a week. I have not had a bad meal. Salads and daily specials are phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Willoughby location previously and the Mentor location today and will definitely be returning. The waitress was very friendly, food was delicious, and service was quick. There's a nice atmosphere inside as well."}
{"text":"My fiance and I recently moved to the area and spent the last 5 weeks looking for a great bar and restaurant. We stopped in for a drink after work because my future in laws recommended it. The place was a bit packed when we walked in, but we were welcomed with open arms. We sat at the bar nearest Mentor Ave. and the bartender Liz welcomed us in like family unlike any other local bar. We were very impressed by how we were treated! The food was great, with wait times of less than 10 minutes! The drinks were great and the service was awesome. We loved the crowd and the environment. Next time we go to the Local Tavern, we are definitely going to hang out in the wine cellar. 5 stars on every aspect of this bar! Not everyone writes a good review, but this place sure deserves it!

-New guy to Lake county"}

{"text":"Great place for lunch or dinner. I can't get away from their Gia grande Humber it's delicious"}
{"text":"Great place and fun atmosphere food was great at a fair price.  Only item I did not enjoy was the cole saw. But it's only a side so no harm there"}
{"text":"Amazing food, huge drinks - all delicious! We got the quesadilla appetizer, stuffed blue cheese burger and the short and sloppy for dinner, all delectable! And even tho we were stuffed, we decided to get the OMG for dessert- heavenly!"}
{"text":"Meh. I was underwhelmed with the quality of food yet overwhelmed by its proportions. Staff is friendly and attentive. But the decor is atrocious and the music is horrible!"}
{"text":"Huge portions! My friend and I ordered the fries as an appetizer only to find out that Godzilla himself couldn't finish them. Got the mac n' cheese with BBQ chicken. Pretty good. Lots of beer choices and the place is huge. Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Favorite spot. Great menu and food. Our friend had the smaller BLT and it was good sized. Our other friend and myself had the daily special pulled pork \"handwich.\" Smoked onsite and very tasty. My wife had the mushroom sandwich.  Excellent.  Over 30 beers on tap."}
{"text":"I came to this excuse of a bar a few days ago and will never be back! My wife and i both got white wine that was not cold but warm! And i thought that was bad enough we get our food and the first thing i see in it is a hair! By then I was completly grosed out and did not want to eat a thing after all the above happen you would think they would take care of the bill but no they not only charged me for the wine but charged me for the food that i did not even eat! There response was we would be more then happy to make you something else... DO NOT COME HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"Local tavern is just what it says. It is a nice place for dinner , drinks and entertainment. It is not a fancy place to eat but the food is very good . It's above bar food with reasonable prices. It's close to home for us and my wife and I love it here.  Nice selection of wines and drinks as well as beers. Not a place to come if you're looking for a quick meal in n out, its busy and popular."}
{"text":"Was in town for an event and found this place on yelp. Great food and drinks. Wish I lived closer so I could visit again."}
{"text":"Found this place by Googling for seafood restaurants near us. The first thing I noticed on entering is how clean it was, even the air vents which is often over looked when a restaurant cleans. I ordered the Grilled Swordfish with asparagus. Wife ordered the AUCE crab legs. The swordfish was done perfectly and the asparagus was tender and slightly crispy. Wife's crab legs were very sweet and she didn't have any waiting on refills of the crab legs. The service was quick and very nice. We have been there twice now and absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Local Tavern. I stopped in with my fiancee for a Saturday lunch. It wasn't very busy, we were seated right away. Our server stopped right away to get our drink order. Since they don't have flavored iced tea, we ordered regular. It was unsweetened so we asked for sugar. Well, she left to get it and we waited and waited for her to come back. She finally did and asked if we were ready to order. We did and then reminded her that we still needed sugar. 
Our food came out in about 20 minutes time which we thought was pretty good. The portion so are huge so bring your appetite. I got the gut buster which is a burger with chili on it. My fiancee got the beast which had short rib,  horseradish,  mushrooms aiole and swiss cheese. Both burgers were cooked to perfection (pink and warm on the inside)  however, they tasted a bit dry. The pile of fries were very good
We will be back here"}
{"text":"I'm new in town and I came in because of the great reviews.  met a few really nice people, Phil and Paula, who told me about other amazing places to eat and drink around here thank so much!  Christie who ran the bar was one of the sweetest and most beautiful bartenders I've ever met and recommended the Caribbean pork sandwich which was amazing!  I'm looking forward to coming back again very soon!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Love the food, especially the meatloaf. Love the live bands. Love the fast service. This place is great."}
{"text":"Just had dinner there for the first time - had the pulled chicken sandwich on naan bread and my wife had the simpleton burger. Both were excellent, as were the fries. Many other appealing items on the menu that I look forward to trying. Service was friendly and welcoming. Back patio will be great on a warm summer evening. Highly recommended if you want tasty, well-prepared comfort food (bar food hardly seems appropriate for such well prepared meals). Portions are generous, and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful family dinner consisting of 3 orders of the oysters, some of the bisque, and some turf as well. Each dish was very delicious! 

My father lived the oysters...plain with a little cocktail sauce only. Edamame was good too - just needed more sea salt! Did I say the oysters were delicious? 

We will definitely return...clean, scrumptious food, and great atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome and service is good.  My kids love the fries and we never go home hungry."}
{"text":"Great food, had the white fish sandwich and fries, what a great piece of fish. HUGE!!! My friend had the burger with balsamic and goat cheese. We started with the Mushroom Lettuce Wraps which were awkward to eat but very tasty."}
{"text":"I'm shocked to report that this weekend is the first time I've had the pleasure of dining at the Local Tavern. I've been hearing great things about it for a while now, and now I can see why!
We came here for dinner on Friday night, and it was surprisingly not very busy. We got a table right away and our food came out within ten minutes (which was awesome because I was on the verge of hangry). I ordered the portabello mushroom sandwich...which was AMAZING! The blend of ingredients was perfect! Goat cheese gave it amazing flavor, without overpowering the dish! I was super happy with it, left satisfied. My boyfriend, the bacon lover, got the huge BLT...and even though the menu boasts 1/2 lb of bacon when it came out he was surprised at the sheer quantity of meat piled on this sandwich. He was a huge fan also! On top of delicious food, they have a great beer selection! The only downside is it is a bit pricey for a bar, but it seemed worth it to me. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just ok.. like a limited menu of burgers and a few other odds and ends.

The plain ol burger was nothing to write home about... one time, only time, and thank you."}
{"text":"Do not come to this restaurant if you have children! According to the manager, the owner CHOSE not to have high chairs or kids menus. My family had to turn around and leave a great looking patio because of no high chairs or boosters seats. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Food was great. I had the BLT and fries. Exellent fries and very large portions. One of the best BLT's I have had. The bacon was crispy and delcious. They also have daily cupcake varieties made by a local baker.  I have reccomended it to several people already."}
{"text":"Love this place! Right down the street. Never knew it was SO good! Shepherds pie is amazing!"}
{"text":"Good food, but the waitstaff desperately needs some basic knowledge on their offerings. 

Went for dinner early-ish on a weeknight. When our waitress arrived to take our drink order, I asked if they had a good stout on tap. She asked me, \"what's that?\"  Umm. How can you waitress at a joint with \"tavern\" in its name without knowing what a stout is? So I said \"it's a dark beer.\"  She recommended a dark ale--\"that's a dark beer.\"  

Calamari for the appetizer. Hot, tender, meaty, crunchy. Definitely recommended. For an entree, I had the Shepherd's Pie. It was tasty, though unconventional.  My dining companion had a burger. Huge, with fresh fries."}
{"text":"Had the shepherds pie, my compliments to the chef, very tasty and filling  I highly recommend it, have enjoyed many a meal here no complaints"}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday after reading reviews and am pleased to say the hype is real. Killer fries, huge portions and an overall great time. We ordered the tavern fries, 7 wings, and a side if mac n cheese.  

The tavern fries is an entire lunch tray of delicious fries that came with a delicious parmesan sauce.

The wings are bone-in, very crispy breaded and come with sauce on the side. I highly recommend the mild buffalo sauce.

The mac and cheese was large and very filling but was not as cheesy or flavorful as i wanted but still was above average.

I will say the prices seem high on the menu but you get what you pay for with large quantities and great quality.

Service was very pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"Best BLT in town. Nice quiet atmosphere. Down to earth crew. Back patio is really nice in the summer. They have a great wine selection and open mic night! Easily a comfortable first date location."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Wine Country burger is a must have once a month! The fries are outstanding and there salads and dressings are great mom's meatloaf sandwich awesome."}
{"text":"Just found this place yesterday and I came back for lunch today. It doesn't look like much from the outside but the food is off the chain!"}
{"text":"I can't express how  pleased I am  with this place!! Have been here countless times and amazing customer service, order something different everytime and always satisfied, whatever they are doing here Bravo!!! I always will recommend local tavern to someone who is looking for their new go to place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Meh.  Service was slow.  Food was ok.  Good concept on spicing up traditional dishes but some were overkill.  The Caesar salad has too much going on and the only thing relating it to a Caesar salad is the dressing and romaine.

Servers were polite, prices are good."}
{"text":"Great food BUT POOR service! No menu available,  had to wait for them to print!  Waitress didn't offer specials, drink order took entirely too long and was wrong. Appetizers come out and the meal not more than 5 minutes later, barely had time to taste the appetizers!  Waitress not at all attentive, heard her tell another party she didn't know anything about the food! All waitresses dressed sloppily, short shorts showing entirely too much.  Decor is nice but I'd rather not be able to see into kitchen on my way to table. We'll probably give it another try because of food but if the service doesn't improve we won't go back."}
{"text":"Ok I think they have a new chef or something. The food was so much better than the last time. So glad for them and, as a customer, we will definitely go back more frequently. There has definitely been some fine tuning... the fries are better seasoned, the food presentation is better.  Always good choices on the menu are the chicken sandwich, fries, sirloin,and the honey mustard and blue cheese salad dressings which are made in-house.  Let's hope Local Tavern keeps it up!"}
{"text":"Spending one night in town on the way to Boston and just looked for closest restaurant, so glad we chose local tavern. Great atmosphere, amazing service and the food.  OMG SO GOOOOOD.  My husband had the BLT it was huge and so tasty. This is not the normal bar fare, it is bar food elevated to another level. We are eating here on our way home from Boston next week!"}
{"text":"Great small place to have a beer or dinner in.

Our waitress was a wonderful young lady who was very responsive to our requests and genuinely cared about our experience.

Food was well prepared, burger was a proper \"medium\" as requested. Turkey melt was phenomenal, fries weren't too crispy (a good thing, cannot STAND it when establishments don't do fries right.  was ice cold, LT lemonade is definitely worth a shot here (a little colorful and sugary but still).

At nighttime, nothing else is lit in the area, so it may appear \"sketchy\" to those who aren't familiar with the area...rest assured it's a safe place even if the parking lot could use an extra light or 5.

A nice surprise for a lonely street in the evening. We expected diner type food, came out with the strong inclination of coming back."}
{"text":"Yes! Ambience, service, food and craft beer selection are all phenomenal. I was really surprised it wasn't busier. The colleague I had dinner with mentioned Mentor is chain-heavy although they do get busier as the weekend approaches. Mentorites, skip the chains and go to Locals; get outside the box, enjoy this place for the absolute gem it is!

For the record, I had a sirloin steak, beautifully grilled, sliced on the bias served with a beautifully beefy reduction sauce and mashed potatoes topped with wilted spinach and other veggies. Outstanding!"}
{"text":"Went here off the Yelp reviews. We went to a movie and wanted to go some place new. Seemed the Local Taverne fit the bill. We went on a Monday and got the $5 burger and fries. They were fantastic. Good flavor on the burger and a ton of fries. Not skimpy at all for a $5 meal. I would definitely go back just from that meal. It was so good! 

Service was okay. It was a slow night so our server was a bit absent. She was busy cleaning up other areas of the place. So we had to wait a bit. Could have been worse. 

I'd go back definitely. Try other menu items."}
{"text":"everything was good. Nothing outragous but great service, good food, and helps i was with great company."}
{"text":"What a great place. Upon getting seated at bar I asked the barmaid to bring me her favorite dish off the menu. I was delighted to see a perfectly cooked med sirloin served with mashed potatoes and spinach on top. The steak was very tender and well seasoned just melts in your mouth. If your in the mentor area try it"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town and the best biscuits I've ever had! I come here about once a month for the painsville city crusher breakfast and I'm always pleased. It's enough food for two but it's to good to share!"}
{"text":"This is no longer the Fish Bar.  I stopped in yesterday and this is now just the Local Tavern with the same menu as the other Local Tavern.  They no longer specialize in fish."}
{"text":"Great local joint.  Good food.  Have some bacon... They have lots!  

Sit at the bar and have some fun."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a whim, not having any idea what to expect.  I was overwhelmed by the exceptional service.  Sharon made me feel like a Regular.  She is the most awesome bartender I have ever had the pleasure to experience.  She did not miss a beat!  Attentive and personable. Sharon is just not a bartender, she is an EXPERIENCE!  I WILL become a regular when Sharon is working!  Food is great too!"}
{"text":"Long time Clevelander, came on a whim. By far one of the best atmospheres of the restraunts in the suburbs. Smaller inside, but full of character. Great service, AMAZING food. The wings are fried without sauce and then you order sauce to dip in. Refreshing and makes them taste twice as good. I personally got the chicken tenderloin with spinach and rice, it was perfect portion and delicious. Tasted a few wing sauces of my friends food and they were all creatively different and tasty. Absolutely coming back again."}
{"text":"Great little place we stumbled upon ! Food was great as were the prices and atmosphere !!!"}
{"text":"While visiting family, I had a late lunch on New Year's Eve at the Local Tavern. Our server Taylor (blonde, really nice) was AWESOME! She took her time with us, answered all of our questions, and made sure we had everything we needed. When she found out we were from Huntington Beach, she sent the owner (?) a text and he treated us to a round of drinks! What a great guy! We appreciated the hospitality. 

The food was great! I had the smaller BLT. We also started with a tray of fries (that balsamic dipping sauce is sooo good)! 

Super-fun atmosphere, amazing service, and delicious food! Thank you for having us!!!"}
{"text":"Our ski club had its dinner of the month at the Fish Bar.  Our service was excellent.  The drink prices are reasonable and the wine pours are generous. Cute decor. They are building a bar in the patio area. It looks like it's going to be done soon. My lobster tacos were delicious. I love the mango. The lobster mashed potatoes were tasty. The gravy for the mushrooms and mashed potatoes was a little bit salty. Most everyone in our group liked the food at the Fish Bar"}
{"text":"Went here a roughly three weeks ago for a close friends birthday dinner...this was our second time (which we had a horrible first experience so we never thought a second would happen) but this time we were happily surprised. 

Our server was awesome - high energy and very fun - the food a vast improvement over the first time.  

Hubbs went for the Shepherds Pie - and I'm full blown Irish and never had one this good...this one was chock full of beef short rib meat and gravy that cannot be beat. I ordered the Black & Blue burger - while ok it would have been better cooked as I requested (med well) instead of well done PLUS but it took so long actually getting our food I simply ate. 

Major downside for me is the incredibly limited craft beer options - cmon folks remember Great Lakes isn't the only place making beer in Cleveland! 

Don't know if I would go back - guess we will see."}
{"text":"We had our best friends and in-laws this evening. Two appetizers and soups came out FAST. The food was AMAZING. And our waitress, Ashley, was amazing - funny and attentive and we weren't her only table. We loved the Famous Little Devils and Shroom Fries. And the Huge BLT is honestly massive!"}
{"text":"8:25 on Saturday night. 7 people at the bar and only one other couple in the booths. Definitely feels like Local Tavern in Mentor did... And I loved that place. The Maryland Crab n Artichoke dip was our starter. Not a lot of crab in it, but the flavor was great - clearly not something from GFS heated up. And served with large slices of toasted bread - very cool. My hubby had the Stuff Your Sole. He never finished meals and eats like a bird. But he scarfed this down in record speed and proclaimed it one of his top 10 meals ever. The Cajun rice and fiahbar slaw were great sides. Fresh andnchef made as well with that Local Tavern flair. I had The Family Lawyer, \"rich, decadent, and full of booze\" according to the menu. And it delivered in full. The mushrooms were a beautiful wine flavored contrast to the lobster. It was well worth the money.

The Blue Hawaiian I had to drink was too strong and I wouldn't order again (not a huge drinker anyway). And the waitress, while nice, could have been more attentive to refills. Everything was $65.00 before tip.... which felt a little high, but for the amazing flavors we decided it was worth it. We will certainly visit more... when we have the money to burn."}
{"text":"We return to local tavern frequently. The burgers are good and I love the island pork sandwich. Also, for the side of fries, we upgrade to shroom fries and never regret it. Solid meal, good service, good in my book"}
{"text":"A little pricey at first but I got a simpleton burger on special. It was pretty good for $5.99. Cheese sticks were good too. Nice tavern atmosphere. Good service, food came out quick."}
{"text":"Stopped into the new location of Local Tavern on Friday night.  Arrived at 6:00 PM and had an estimated hour wait for a table either inside or outside. The place was packed...good sign since this location has had a hard time keeping anything for too long.  There are 4 bars - one main bar and 2 smaller bars inside and one bar outside on the patio.  There were a good number of unseated tables on the patio - apparently there was some mix-up with the hostess and reservations were taken for outside when they weren't supposed to be.  But, they just opened - still working out the kinks.  Once we got sat, it was a long time before our waitress came over - talked to the owner who apologized and had someone else wait on us for the rest of the evening and did everything to make the situation right.  Much appreciated.

The menu is the exact same as the Willoughby Hills location... good variety of appetizers, sandwiches, burgers, and several other entrees.  After hearing the raves of the burgers, decided to go with the Porky Burger which was a beef burger topped with shaved pork and bacon along with the usual lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickle.  The burgers are huge...patties are bigger than the bun.  I was disappointed in the seasoning - the burger patty was not seasoned.  But, again - just opened and still working out the bugs.  I would definitely try the burger again.  You get a --lot-- of fresh cut fries or you can get a side salad.  

There is a small stage for live music with house sound and house-drums.  A local blues band broke it in for the first time and sounded great.  It wasn't too loud that you couldn't still have a conversation.  

The patio is large, as mentioned with a bar.  Lots of umbrellas and several tables under an awning to keep out of the sun.  The waitresses (with the exception of our first one) were all very attentive and moved around quickly.  Everyone was friendly and did a great job.  

3 stars for now.. I'll give them another try after they are open a little longer.    Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Nothing but the best from the owners of the Local Tavern. Fish:Bar is primarily a seafood / sushi bar but has some good eats for the non-seafood eaters. A couple of the burgers normally seen at the LT along with a couple of steaks. Prices are very reasonable. The staff is amazing - service is great and the food came out of the kitchen quickly. I started out with the hot tuna roll - spicy tuna with cucumber sushi roll. I then moved on to the New England clam chowder infused with --BACON-- and then finished with the Family Lawyer - Chunked lobster with a Jameson and mushroom cayenne cream sauce served over barley wild rice and topped with sautéed spinach. Excellent!! Stop in and check this place out. Great addition to the area."}
{"text":"Really great food with good service. I only gave 4 stars though due to location,  it's in a crummy part of the city."}
{"text":"Great service! Huge portions! Left happy and full! Beer selection is below average.... Good lent options though! Overall very pleased!"}
{"text":"Blackened grouper siracha and greens salad was fantastic! Craft beer selection is awesome, neat atmosphere, everything is home made too. You are missing out if you pass this place up!"}
{"text":"I've been here with a party of 4, and a large group. The food overall is tasty. The fries are amazing.

If you expect a burger to be any temperature except over well done, forget about it. My medium rare burgers were hockey pucks. Lesson learned...do not order the burger here.  I ordered burgers because everyone talks about them here. I guess these people like overcooked burgers.

I also ordered a side of their slaw. Oh, it was good. It has a nice kick, and I really enjoyed it. 

I can say that the salads look amazing. Heard lots of yummy mouth noises from dining partners. 

I will probably return, but will not be swayed into another burger."}
{"text":"Love, love, love The Local Tavern. I've been here with 1-2 friends and with groups of 10-12. The food is amazing. Think stuff you grew up on taken up some notches. My favorites are the short and sloppy and the it's not your meatloaf sandwiches. Also get the calamari fries- absolutely delicious!! 

When it's nice out, the patio is open and they frequently have music going on the patio. The only downside is they're not open on Sundays, which is a bummer during football season"}
{"text":"The service was terrible. My husband and I decided to give The Local Tavern a try for lunch. We were sat in the farthest spot way in the back. I am guessing we weren't the everyday lunch crew. \"They forgot about us back here,\" should have been the clue to just leave. The server decided to give all her attention to the other table of business men. My husband ended up ordering our drinks right from the bartender. The food was good but nothing to run back for. Next time I know to order take out."}
{"text":"Local Tavern is a pretty local place to me. It's on my running route and I would always get a whiff of the delicious fries/burgers smell. I swung in with a buddy to try it out. It's a small to medium restaurant setup. One menu with specials throughout the day. Burgers, wings, sandwiches, and other items are on the menu. The menu is pretty straight forward. I had the island pork sandwich which came with fries. It was absolutely fantastic. So freaking good. I'm a fan of BSpot which in on the west side, but I think I found a gem locally. Portion was huge and justified the price. I will def. be coming back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Mentor. The food is always good. Always consider the daily specials because that's where this place really shines. The specials are always beautifully plated  and delicious.  The regular menu has a few stars also. I recommend the tavern angus beef meatloaf that comes with smashed garlic potatoes. The stuffed burgers are ok but not spectacular.  

I would give the place five stars if I was just judging on food but this place is going downhill in the atmosphere department.  They recently added a tacky giant rooster inside and the waitresses are now wearing tank tops and short shorts... This isn't hooters!  The volume of the music is deafening... It makes me feel old to have to say that LOL.  The last time we went they were hosting a high school grad party and they turned the main dining area into a club with loud 90's music and dancing. It was dinner time not late evening ... I wanted to enjoy dinner with my husband not have flashbacks to my 20's"}
{"text":"I used to be a big fan of this place since they first opened. Then they slowly started elimating items from the menu. First the cheddar biscuits, then the grilled romaine salad. Now you can no longer order any kind of fish tacos whatsoever. That was a real bummer, as they had some of the best in town. 

They still do serve the tomato bisque, which is always top notch. And their perch dinner was tasty. But, I see this place on the decline...like, I'm not anticipating going back there for a long time. Sure, the service was friendly and prompt. The food was just okay this time around. I think I'll be going to other seafood restaurants in the area from now on."}
{"text":"Out of town on business , decided to check this place out . The food was fabulous and the help (Lyndsey) was extremely nice! Can't miss! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Monday through Wednesday and Sundays is a great experience with Sharon at the bar...she genuinely cares about her patrons and is able to use sarcasm and humor to retain customers...my wife really appreciates her and we love the food!"}
{"text":"amazing place...friendly, welcoming bar atmosphere with emphasis on their scratch kitchen. the burgers are outstanding with a nice char and juicy middle, wings are \"fried chicken\" style, not buffalo style, but are delicious with or without their house made sauces, bartenders are very friendly and informative, just an awesome place to chill for drinks or a great meal, fish dinner is delicious as well, overall you get an enormous amount of food for what you spend and i don't think there is a better place in mentor for a dining or drinking experience"}
{"text":"My husband and I constantly struggle to find good places to eat in the area. Fortunately, I followed the advice of other yelpers and thankfully, we gave Local Tavern a shot. The menu is simple and straight forward, but has a twist on otherwise typical pub fare. I ordered the fish and chips and it was delicious with crispy coating and moist tender fish. The slaw was slightly sweet with a little heat in the back.The fries, the fries, and the...more fries are outstanding! Hubby ordered the simpleton burger and repeated over and over the best burger he's had in the area. We couldn't believe the price point considering the amount of food we received. Wish we knew about this place sooner...My only complaint is the parking lot turns into a puddle of mud and you trash your clothes and car when it's wet. I am sure the employees aren't psyched about it either..... wear boots when it rains"}
{"text":"Consistently good service here. The food is tasty and portions are very generous. It is extremely clean and we really enjoy the specials. The patio is an unexpected surprise!"}
{"text":"One of the Best lobster rolls in the area. Haven't tried everything on the menu yet but all the food that we have tried so far has been great. I recommend"}
{"text":"We live in Painesville and this is another feather in our cap. The service is extraordinary and the food is very good. The prices are also reasonable for the quality of food we were served. My husband got the sirloin rare, and it was done perfectly. So many places don't get rare steak done right, no worries here. My Lobster Mac n Cheese was absolutely rich and decadent, and loaded with chucks of lobster. The cab was a steal and completely delish! Highly recommend this place . And, by the way, they serve a crazy variety of vodka martinis!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch spot if you find yourself on the east side. 
The serve staff is amazing and friendly. Soups are always really good. My go to is the fish and chips! Huge portions for a pretty reasonable price. Great place for a business lunch or to catch a game. Very unique environment with a ton of different art styles."}
{"text":"This place is located not far from where I live.  The parking lot is always full on the weekend, so I've been anxious to try Local Tavern based on the Yelp reviews.   I stopped here on a weeknight after work, looking for a decent burger and fries.   I was immediately seated given a placement which doubled as the menu.  There was also a separate piece of paper with the day's specials.   I ordered the Simpleton burger which comes with special sauce and pickle and a choice of fries or salad.  I OF COURSE ordered the fries that I've heard so much about.  I also requested lettuce and tomato for my burger.  My entree arrived a short time later.   The burger was very good, sufficient size...probably 1/3 pound on a fresh toasted bun.   The burger was tasty, as was the thick, hand cut fries.   This was a very good meal without being overwhelming as sometimes burgers are.   The menu offered a nice selection of appetizers and entrees to include, wings, salads and pastas.    I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"We ate dinner there last night after arriving in town late. We eat vegan and gluten free so food choices are difficult traveling. Our meals were delicious. My wife had the Super Salad and I had VegHed pasta entree with zucchini noodles rather than pasta. They didn't add cheeses to either dish and we were happy. They serve until 10 PM which was helpful. Service was friendly and good. Definitely gluten free and vegetarian friendly. We shall return."}
{"text":"Holy effing cow! What? Cows are holy? Yes. On my recent visit to Local Tavern I opted out of ordering one the mouth watering burgers that were being enjoyed at the busy bar for a fish dinner. A righteous beef patty was spared. 

Local Tavern is not your average dive bar in the sticks. It may look like red neck haven but don't let looks deceive you. The interior is pretty hip. Lava lamps, classic rock, and local art give this place an eclectic vibe.

I stopped in around 2:30pm on a Tuesday. The bar was almost full and there were about four tables occupied. That is a really good sign. 

Back to that bad ass fish dinner- The menu boasts standard bar fare with a playful twist. Think fresh avocados and house made puled pork on prime sirloin burgers served with thick house cut fries. Oh my. i wanted to order one of those juicy burgers so bad but something inside me told me to get the fried cod so that is what I ordered. The lady at the bar \"warned\" me that the pieces of fish were huge and I might just want to order the half portion. I believed her but ordered the full portion anyways. While I waited a few minutes for my food to come out, I was having a fun time reading all the beer selections. Local Tavern has the best selection of craft brews, plenty on tap plenty in bottle, in Lake County. I love Belgian beers and ordered two different types. Each were served in proper glass ware so I could enjoy the caramel like nose on the first and deep brown sugar on the second. When my food came out  I saw two foot long pieces of olden fried fish, a pile of thick cut fries, and slaw. I was told by the bartender \"You can't say I didn't warn you\", She was right the portion was huge. I could tell the fish was freshly battered and had a nice beer flavor in the breading. Ahhhh so good. The side of tarter sauce was oh so dilly and citrusy. I could pour that stuff on my fries or just about anything. Local Tavern should sell it retail. The slaw was a huge surprise. Instead of the overly mayo-sweet dressing the slaw was a medley of thinly sliced veggies with an almost Asian like dressing. It was kind of sweet, kind of salty, kind of tangy, and super fresh. Bam! it won me over. Next time I come back I am ordering another side of the slaw. 

I was so surprised that my lunch was so good that I had to wash it down with another drink. I opted for a glass of wine after looking at their selection. Now, normally any place in Lake County is going to carry some shitty wine pours to please the abundance of hillbilly clientele. Local Tavern carries exactly the opposite. Think Pinot Gris from Willamette Valley, Marlborough Sauv Blancs, Old World blends and New World smokey Zins and Napa Cabs. 

I want to go back to Local Tavern so bad. My next visit is going to be tricky because I want to try one of the burgers but the fried cod is so finger licking good that I might have found my regular item on the menu. I guess I am going to have to take a friend come summer and enjoy a sampling of the menu while sitting on the patio."}
{"text":"I heard this place was great and since I have a birthday coming up I decided to check it out to see if I wanted to have dinner there with my friends on my birthday. I went in about 6:15pm on a Tuesday night. It was a little busy but not all the tables were full and the bar I sat at had half of the seats open. I just wanted a beer and to peruse the menu. No one spoke to me for about 4 minutes even with a bartender standing not 6 feet from me conversing with an older couple. A few minutes later a different girl comes flying by and asks if I want a menu (not if I wanted a drink which is obvious since I'm AT the bar and I have no drink in front of me) I said yes and before I could tell her what I wanted to drink she was off! I waited, and waited...finally the guy next to me said, \"hey thats a pretty good drink you got there, bet it tastes good!\" I laughed and said,\" yeah best I ever had\". The girl never got me a menu, she proceeded to take 2 other people's orders, the couple to my left and another couple at a table near the bar. I finally got tired of waiting and just left. If thats the kind of service they give on a slow night I can't imagine what it's like on a busy night! Don't think I'll be returning for a while, if ever."}
{"text":"Great Food, Fantastic Service, & Amazing Atmosphere! If you are near any of the Local Tavern Locations try them out and you'll be thrilled you did!!"}
{"text":"What a surprise. On the outside, it looks a dive, but once you step in you get the whole package. Friendly service, nice atmosphere, high end and imaginative bar food, and good drinks.

The calamari fries are particularly good.

We came here for a quick drink after work, and the place was packed. Given how good this place is, I am not surprised. If I lived in Cleveland (I was in Cleveland on a business trip), I would come here more often too.

This is a MUST try if you are in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and always enjoy the food, service, and atmosphere. Don't go expecting five star dining. This essentially is an eclectic sports bar with a laid back 60s vibe. They have a nice beer & wine selection. I've enjoyed their calamari sticks, burgers, fish sandwiches, etc. One evening they offered a salmon avocado burger for a special that was awesome. Most sandwiches come piled with thick cut, delicious homemade fries. They offer many other items I have yet to try (huge salads, ribs, steak, etc). Definitely look forward to stopping here again."}
{"text":"Was my first time there me, my mom, and my husband went there for my birthday in November 4th.

First off me and my husband order the fish bowl drink it was huge I know there are bigger ones out there but it was very good, I happen to over hear that it was the bartenders first time making it and it was really good for a first try and well worth the 20 bucks we payed for it to share through the whole meal.

Our waitress Madeline was too nice an very honest about what she thought. She was very attentive and sounded like she knew the menu pretty well.

We got first an appetizer of the fried cheese biscuits with the honey butter soo yummy I wanted to eat them all by myself.

Then my husband got the clam chowder it was soo ridiculously creamy and hand a great then to the bacon infused broth

My dinner was the sirloin and it was amazing I can't believe I finished it it was 16 ounces plus corn, bread, AND real mashed potatoes.

My husband had gotten the other steak on their menu I believe was a New York strip steak 10 ounces... Just as good this came with peas instead of corn but everything else was the same and just as good

Now my mom got the butter fried chicken... Yes I wish I had gotten that not that my steak wasn't amazing.... It came with two more of the fried cheese biscuits... The best coleslaw it had cheese in it what a weird and delightful surprise, bread and those real mashed potatoes.

The we all shared a dessert the weirdest banana cream pie it came in a bowl with cookies as the crust and Carmel on top not the best I have ever had but by far not the worst it was good but more like a pudding I would recommend trying it once. I will so go back again"}
{"text":"Being a sushi loved I could not wait to try this  place. I went on a week night, Thursday, with my aunt, uncle, & my boyfriend. My aunt a a drink called naughty mermaid. It was strong & good & she had a couple. The boys had beers & I had a pumpkin pie martini & a Christmas Ale. The bartender was a little slow with the drinks but we didn't mind too much as we were having fun. 
We had delicious friend cheddar biscuits for an app & thought our waitress was super cute & fun.
My boyfriend had a fried fish & chips dinner that he said was really good. My aunt enjoyed her steak & my uncle said the lobster roll was delicious. I could not decide between the Painesville roll & the Hannibal roll so I got both & shared. Yum-o!! Both were exceptional, ESPECIALLY the Hannibal! We all want to go back & my aunt could t wait to tell my cousins about 1/2 price sushi Tuesday's. I will be takin advantage of that very soon as well."}
{"text":"I haven't posted a review for local tavern lately, because I really haven't had time to go out and have a drink with my buddies. However my wife and I were able to stop in on a Saturday night, and were able to have some drinks with some friends. Our most favorite bartender in the world was not there, however the one we got in her place did a really really good job. We rather my wife wanted a salted caramel martini for whatever reason and the bartender meet three or four different iterations of this an attempt to placate my dear wife. We did not eat because we had already eaten someplace else but we did have a couple rounds of drinks there. The bartender is been very attentive, and we were never running low out and drinks before she was able to come refill s. Once again local tavern is not fail to disappoint."}
{"text":"We stopped in the best far as I am a fan of the local tavern down the street and mentor. Probably the worst part about this whole place is the parking. you got a restaurant that will hold 35 vehicles and there were 50 cars trying to park. once inside, the old Chester's tavern is long gone. They did a great job and remodeling, and it's almost a man cave art show where everything is for sale. If you desire an old school Miller Lite neon sign, its for sale. You can decorate your man cave all from your table. Are particular experience was pretty nice because there is a barbershop quartet that happened to come in to grab something to eat and ended up staring at the entire restaurant which was pretty cool. I had a meal called pesto chicken which was basically chicken strips which were WAY over cooked for my taste but good nonetheless drizzled in a pesto sauce with a massive salad. It was just what I wanted and tasted great but again the chicken was cooked in just a little too long. the waitress had brought some sake for my wife and unfortunately was familiar with how sake is served and she brought it in a wine glass and it was cold. However the bartender did a solid and came out and brought a proper serving of sake. will definitely hit this place up again"}
{"text":"Had lunch at Local Tavern with my brother. The service was spot on, food was delivered quickly, and hot. Delicious !!!! I had the wine country with the tomato bisque instead of fries.  The soup was really good!! The burger, perfectly cooked and delicious!! My brother had the MacDaddy, it was enormous!!! Our server was very helpful, informative, and I never had an empty glass. I WILL MOST CERTAINLY BE RETURNING !!!!!"}
{"text":"I was worried about going to a tavern like this on a football Sunday, but there weren't more than 2 or 3 tables occupied here at any given time. I assume that by late December everyone had given up on the Cleveland football team, but I'll never know for sure. 

Food was good. Portions were huge. Nothing fancy, just good bar food. More or less what I expect when visiting a Cleveland area restaurant anymore. 

I've heard this place is ridiculously popular and some nights cars are parked way down the street because everyone wants to come here. I'm still scratching my head about that one, but hey, maybe the next time I go it'll be like that."}
{"text":"I was more than impressed with the food and service upon our visit. The burgers are huge and incredibly tasty. I can't wait to visit again and try something else on the menu. Local Tavern has earned itself a spot on our list of good local places to eat."}
{"text":"It is a cool place to drink. Only thing i don't like is how chopped up it is and how many different rooms their are. You also can't carry your tab from one bar to another. Very annoying especially when it's packed and you move around to another room."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd visit in as many months and decided to write a review. I believe the place is doing a really good job. I've ordered the oysters (Plane Jane) each time and never disappointed with the quality, presentation and freshness of the oysters. I've tried several of the menu items and I believe the quality and portions of the meals are excellent. My side order of salad that came with the chicken was as large as a full salad. Extremely tasty to boot.They usually have a nice special menu also, appears to be a daily offering."}
{"text":"This place is a well kept secret that  should be kept.  We live relatively close and pass it at least a couple of times a week and have never gone.  We are retired and we get together with another couple once a month for lunch and it was my turn to choose the restaurant based on reviews on Yelp decided to try it.  It was just great.  The food was delicious - I had one of the burgers and one of our party had the shepherd's pie which he thought was the best he'd ever had.  The service was just awesome.  She kept an eye on us and refilled our drinks without being asked.  Our only complaint and it isn't really a complaint is that the amount of fries is a little overwhelming.  You could cut back on them by half and there still would be a lot.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"I have lower my review on star, went there on 5 dollar Burger day, and it was not a positive experience. When ordering the Burger, I specifically asked for it to be pink or medium. It was cooked super well done.  I sent it back, to get another well done Burger. At this point I was not going for another screw up.  They also seem to have made the Burger much smaller than the last time. 

Needless to say I will not do another burger here again"}
{"text":"Best bar food I've ever had! The appetizers will knock your socks off with their awesomeness. So much so that when your meal comes you may be too full. Great service with a smile as well! Only downside for me is that it is far from our house...but that's probably for the best because I would probably eat their Mac and Cheese every day...but the pounds I'd put on would be soooo worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"Wish I didn't even have to give this place a star. This is the SECOND TIME my husband and I have tried eat here by ourselves. Hostess sat us, and BOTH times we sat there for TEN MINUTES without one person coming over to our table. We got up and left without one person acknowledging us either time. There was probably only five other couples in the entire place at 7:00pm on Monday night. We have been there a couple other times in larger groups so of course then we got mediocre service, but the food is definitely not worth waiting 20 minutes to even be noticed sitting at a table. I would not recommend and we will not ever be back. Go somewhere else if you have a taste for seafood."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Thursday. Ordered the fish, huge portion, pretty good. Loved the spicy cole slaw. Would go back."}
{"text":"So had the opportunity to try this place out again after being told some of the service issues were corrected. 

The menu has a lot of the items that were/ are available at The Local Tavern. I've been there and had many of the items on this menu. I've always been pleased with the value (the quality for the price) of what they offer but feel it has started leaning to the higher priced side of acceptable. This menu offers a larger selection with a focus on fish and seafood. I tried the fish tacos. While they were flavorful with great ingredients, I do believe they were a bit over priced and over cooked for tuna. 

The service was very good and it appeared clean inside. All the staff were friendly and acknowledged everyone coming and going. I'm glad this place was kept open and hope The Local Fish Bar is successful in Painesville!"}
{"text":"The blue flame burger is a must try, the blue cheese hot sauce is one of a kind and the fries are always fresh. Very generous portion sizes"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!  We loved the wings and house salad with pang soooo good!   OMG dessert was excellent.  Definitely one of our favorite places to go!"}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back. I will say this, the appetizers are most likely some of the heaviest appetizers I have bee had so I recommend you don't go crazy like we did. All in all this is hands the best in the area regardless what anyone says."}
{"text":"Great patio and even more amazing burgers.    I had a burger stuffed with blue cheese and bacon and covered in buffalo sauce. It was huge! The service was excellent and we will definitely be going back. Love it!"}
{"text":"We planned a surprise party for my mother here recently and the service and food were phenomenal.  The process of selecting the food, and organizing the event was easy and the restaurant was quick to respond and provide guidance.  The party room was great and the server was very attentive amd quick to respond to my guests requests.  Everything turned out great and I would highly recommend for any event you want to have.  I can't wait to go back for dinner."}
{"text":"This was a very nice place we visited on Halloween. There were several good beers on tap including a nice stout and a couple very good IPA's. The menu was extensive with lots of interesting selections. I opted for a stuffed hamburger that had mac and cheese, tomato and some kind of sauce inside. It was quite tasty and very filling. The staff was very friendly and our server was attentive. All in all a very good time."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and service!! Never had a bad experience. Try the little devil's they are soooo good!!!"}
{"text":"It was a Sunday night and the place wasn't too busy. Sat at the bar in the front and took the bartender about 10 mins to walk over and take our drink order (we were at a table). She was talking to a patron at the bar (and seemed to know we were there). 

Ordered the fries w mushrooms. Was delicious, but had every intention of both ordering sandwiches. After eating the fries - we were too full and that's all we ordered. Although the portion size is nice, they should offer a 1/2 size so patrons don't get so stuffed on the apps. This is the 2nd time we've been there for dinner and both times we've been too full to order more. :( Also, order took longer than normal and we were told it was bc there's was a large birthday party in the next room. It was buffet, so they had notice to preplan for the party? 

Good food and unique place. Would stop again for apps."}
{"text":"I'd been to this bar a few times in the past. Each time I was there, it had a different name, owner, and set of issues that prevented it from being successful. But I think this time, the owners have gotten it totally right. 

Yes, the curb appeal isn't the greatest and parking is a little limited, but once you walk inside, this bar really shines. There's nice decor, ample seating, and when the weather is nice, there's a surprisingly large patio with an outdoor bar.

I met up with some coworkers for some fresh air and much needed beverages and was really impressed by just about everything. Local Tavern has a unique drink list, plenty of craft beer, and a gourmet sounding food menu. We were seated on the patio and were shaded from the sun by large umbrellas on the two tables we pushed together. I was able to order a drink almost immediately after sitting down and it showed up shortly after. The waitress was good about checking up on us and refilling our drinks as needed, which was an amazing feat considering the patio was packed and there were just a couple servers. As our party started to clear out, service wasn't quite as good, and it was hard to track down our server to cash out. But she was busting her tail so I won't hold that against her. 

No one was in the mood for real food, so we split an order of fries. It's hard to be wowed by fries, but...I really enjoyed them. They were crispy and perfectly seasoned with fresh pepper and salt. Further down the table, some of my drinking compadres ordered some fancier fries, covered in mushrooms and cheese. Fries must be their \"thing\" since they have a couple different types of them on the menu. 

Overall, I had a great time at this bar and will definitely go back to try more of their food and spend some time on the patio."}
{"text":"Super awesome staff.... And friendly! Never have had a bad meal or bad service.... Tonight we had the BEST meals we've had here and awesome customer service from the whole wait staff and the owner. Delicious sushi presented fabulously, awesome quinoa, asparagus and grilled tuna steak..... And picture perfect (and deliciously edible) Blue Flame Burger! AND I LOVE the short fat straws for my drink!! Awesome vibe."}
{"text":"This place is very unassuming. It's an old house that was converted into a restaurant. It is enormous! They feature a huge deck, but I didn't get to enjoy it as it was cold. I had the shepherd's pie, which featured short rib, mushrooms, spinach, mashed potatoes, etc, and a balsamic drizzle. I can't get over this damn shepherds pie. I want it all the time! My dad had the kielbasa and sauerkraut which he really enjoyed. The beer selection was good, and they have a lot of TVs so it's a good spot to go a catch a game."}
{"text":"Sorry LT, but I am dropping a star. Still one of the best places around in its class, but I have been looking forward to awesome fries for 4 years and when I returned they were good, but not \"to die for\".

Service is friendly, food is good, beer selection is decent. No complaints. I will likely return on my next trip to the area."}
{"text":"7PM, St. Patty's Day 2015 and no Corned Beef? SERIOUSLY!? Tells you all you need to know."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Service is mediocre, and no air conditioning.  Great place in the winter."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Not your typical bar food where everything is prepared the same as other places.  They put their own little touches to their offerings and I really like that. 

The blue flame burger with spicy sauce and egg was superb with lots of flavor and spice. The tavern fries are fresh cut and seasoned.  The BLT is something special with a half pound of bacon. Pictures don't do it justice.  The sandwich size is food challenge territory.  I enjoyed the wings which are super crispy on the outside. They are served dry with the sauce on the side.  There are a unique variety of sauces to choose from to satisfy your taste. 

There's a nice spacious patio in the back with plenty of tables.  Their bar at the patio area is set up well with large flats screen TVs so you can see them from your table.  They have handled our large groups with no problems.  Good experiences here."}
{"text":"The food is very good and has a nice atmosphere. The service however is a different story. We were not acknowledged by the staff to be seated in a timely manner. I ordered a side salad that I never received, yet could see it in the back. The server was horrendous. She filled my water once and never asked for it to be filled again. I never received the garlic bread that was supposed to come with my pasta neither. If the service would improve I would give it more stars."}
{"text":"excellent  the food and atmosphere, the food was delicious and the service was awsome. a must stop if you are in the area. this is the best local tavern. and Big John Hayes is the best!! he accommodated us very well thanks john we will be back!"}
{"text":"Local Tavern is a very solid American style restaurant. I've been a few times and I have never had a bad meal. The chili cheese fries and the Caesar salad are a couple of the menu items that really stood out. The fries come on a huge baking dish and are enough for 6 people to share but they are a must get for me. The service has always been solid and the restaurant itself is very clean. It is definitely worth a try if you are in the Mentor area."}
{"text":"I really like the local tavern restaurants but this place did not blow me away at all. Two buddies of mine and I went on a Friday night and sat at the bar. None of us could decide on what we wanted, so we decided to order a bunch of things to try. We got the firecracker shrimp, lobster gauc, bread plate, mussels in red sauce, lamb lollipops,
Lobster tail dinner with lobster mashed potatoes, oysters and the calamari. The lamb lollipops, lobster mashed potatoes and the firecracker shrimp were fairly good but the rest was nothing to write home about. The service at the bar was great and the restaurant itself is extremely clean. I will probably give this place another chance to get an actual entree but my first experience was very lackluster."}
{"text":"Very good shepherd pie with shredded beef, mushrooms , and onions and good sauce
Not much of a drinker but there white wine sangria was excellent
My wife tropical pulled pork was very good as well
Service was very good"}
{"text":"This place is great. I wasn't expecting much because of the location and the incredibly poor name, \"Local Tavern\", but it has all the makings of a great local tavern. Nice layout, long bar, cozy atmosphere, great food, ample TVs. I would frequent this place all the time if I lived in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This was a great little find by my sister-in-laws home! The service was great and the people there were wonderful. Everyone at the bar were part of everyone's conversation and it truly felt like a \"Local Tavern\". 

They had a wide selection of beers on draft including seasonal such as Great Lakes Christmas Ale (which is always my favorite). The food was delicious as well! Not overly greasy at all, which I expect at every tavern I go to. I had an order of the wings which were surprisingly outstanding! As I said before, they weren't greasy, the breading was perfect, and their choices of sauces were perfect (I went with the Sweet Chili and the Mild on the side for dipping). My husband got their chili which he thought was one of the best (just wished for more cheese and green onion on the side - small helping of that but good sized chili portion). My sister in law got the loaded cheese fries after she saw it pass our table for another customer. They looked absolutely delicious and based on how fast they finished them off, I can surely say they enjoyed them.  We will definitely be back for some delicious comfort foods and a nice cold beer!"}
{"text":"The waitress are all wonderful and the Caprese salad and mushroom fries are amazing! I also love their martinis!"}
{"text":"After twelve hours of driving, I had a simple craving: I wanted a burger. The Local Tavern did not disappoint. The burger was cooked to perfection, as were the fries. The beer selection is impressive and they're all pretty reasonably priced. The atmosphere is comfortable (the lava lamps and other decorative choices are on point). The staff are all friendly and attentive. Whether you live here or are just passing through, it's worth stopping in."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes.  Good service and great food. The burgers are awesome.   Fries fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to go for wonderful food at very reasonable prices.  Killer fries are just that.  Pastas are huge.  $10 steak special is spot on.  Burgers and Wings(huge) were flavorful as were the quesadelicious.  If you have a moment to step out of your traditional box, stop in and try a bite, you won't be disappointed.

Note: No Happy Hour but you'll still be happy."}
{"text":"The Wine Country Burger is to die for!!  OMG!!

But the photos are this site are over 4 years old!  The prices have definitely increased."}
{"text":"First time there. We went for lunch. Pretty good variety of food. We ordered fish taco, lobster bisque, fried cheddar biscuits, oyster Po' boy and valentine sushi.

The fried cheddar biscuit is a bomb. Delicious. Crispy, savory on the outside. Moist and tender inside. They serve a side of butter but I didn't need at all.

The lobster bisque is a little disappointment.  A little too salty for my taste. The soup looks grainy like cream bisque broke. Not too much sweet lobster taste at all. The lobster meat tasted funny like lobster surimi  instead of full sweet succulent lobster meat.

The oyster po boy is great. Oyster fried to perfection. Crunchy on outside and nice juicy inside. It's a very small sandwich like small hot dog bun. A lot of fries which makes the plate inbalance. 

Fish taco is good. Nicely breaded fish and good fillings.

The valentine sushi special is really good. Maybe lighten up on sauce. Great flavor. The sushi rice is very good. Rice is perfect grain with spot on moisture and seasonings.

Our waitress was really good and attentive. Great service and nice ambience. 

Definitely going back for dinner instead of lunch."}
{"text":"We been back several times for burgers. One of the best burger around the area. Well made and executed. The fries are great. Portions are big. We ordered one of the fries appetizer and it came in a 1/4 sheet pan. Enough for 4-5 people. Calamari is great. It's regular tavern atmosphere. This is our regular go-to for burgers and beer place."}
{"text":"Once again this place has changed hands... I hope this spot actually sticks around though. We stopped in only for drinks but did check out the menu while we were there. Not your average pub grub because they don't have microwaves or freezers and use locally grown ingredients. Seems like a cool concept. The bartender was attentive and their local love carries over to the brews as well, cellar rats and Columbus brew co to name a few. Atmosphere is a nifty music theme but I'm not really sure where the lava lamps all over the bar come into play. Hopefully they are still in business when we come back to try the food because it sounds very appealing."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a monday. The decor had a fun and  tasteful \"rock-n-roll\" kind of vibe to it. The highlight was the large gourmet burger I had. Probably the best I've ever eaten...and it was under $10. The menu is a bit limited but what they do make, they make it very well. Didnt get a drink but they seemed to have a nice beer and wine selection as well. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I can't figure out why my first review was filtered!  My husband and I ate there again on Saturday night, September 15th.  When we ordered, our server, Jordan, warned us that our food would be somewhat delayed due to the very large party (25+) sitting near us on the patio.  She checked on us at least twice after bringing our drinks, just to be sure that we were OK and knew our food would be out soon.  It was worth waiting for.  I had the Blackened Shrimp special, and it was excellent.  My husband's \"Perfect 10\" sirloin filet was medium-rare as ordered, and was accompanied by homemade mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach.  He loved it.  We will go back often!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy the Fish Bar, and we're anticipating a positive experience at the Mentor Local Tavern. We arrived on a Sunday afternoon and were seated immediately. We waited about 10 minutes and were never approached by our server even though the table next to us was given attention 3 separate times while we sat and waited. At one point their waitress looked straight at us without saying a word even though we were looking expectantly at her, expecting a greeting of some sort. Even saying \"I'll be right back\" or \"I'm not your server but I'll go find them\" would have kept us from leaving, but we weren't even acknowledged, so we left."}
{"text":"Loss of stars due to service and layout. Two stars for the ambiance and potential... 

First the layout: There's multiple rooms at the Mentor location, based on it being the old Sawyer house. The decor, architecture, and music is nice. The problem is when you walk up to the \"bar\" area the first thing you see are a bunch of cheap drafts (bud, miller, coors, and light versions of each, etc.). I wondered, is this all they have here? Only until I asked for a drink list, did I see that they actually have a pretty impressive draft list. You just don't see it at all and they are really missing out on impressing their clientele! I was sitting in the bar area and ordered a GLBC. My friend ordered a Buchanan's. Our bartender (the only one at the bar) had to leave and go to another room to get my beer AND the liquor.  This bar should consider: 1) rearranging their taps so customers either see a mix of their offerings or have all of the taps in one area to make sure they are known as a \"craft beer\" bar and 2) having all of their liquor in each bar area. Liquor doesn't go bad, so I don't know why they wouldn't have all the options at each bar for their customers to see and to help their bartenders be efficient. (Based on this - maybe they should get some help from John Taffer?)

Second, the service. The bartender attended us when we were the only table in the bar area. But she brought my friend a dirty martini that was so dirty it was from the trash. Also, when I ordered a non-well scotch and soda she didn't know the name/brand of the scotch or where it was at - I had to say the name three times and point it out to her. Maybe she should familiarize herself with what the bar serves? After 2 additional tables came in, one of which it seemed she knew people,  we waited 20 minutes without service after our drinks went dry before I went and talked to another employee.  We got our drinks from them. We saw our  waitress one more time when we asked for our checks, which then we never got from her. 

I'll give the bar this: when I mentioned our poor service, they gave us a free round. But the manager didn't do much to help after or seem to tell her to try to keep tabs on us. Thankfully a very attentive server came to get our checks and we ended up giving her our tips, cash, to make sure the person who worked hard got their due. 

I'll give this place another try, but I'm only in town 2x a year. Maybe I'll change my rating. But until they figure out how to provide timely service, Local Tavern will remain a 2."}
{"text":"Wasn't that impressed with the food. It was okay. The atmosphere was alright. I'd prefer to just go a little further down Rt 20 to Winking Lizard or Hairy Buffalo. My wife got the grilled cheese sandwich and said it was awful, came with pub cheese spread on it and was 99.9% huge bread slices. So, go to Melt if you're looking for grilled cheese I suppose is the moral to that story. The best thing about it is the old house it occupies. So, there is potential."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and gotten great service. I will note that we sat at the bar each of the previous times. The food is great, no complaints there. This visit, the service was non existent. We barely saw our waitress, we finally got drinks from another waitress. When our waitress finally came, she took our order and then we waited and waited and waited. Finally our food came. It was tasty. We didn't see our waitress again until the check. This is a great place with great food. It's a shame that service is not a priority here. What a shame!"}
{"text":"I have been here once before & loved it. This tine, the service was a little slow but the food was still amazing. The fries come with a balsamic aole sauce for dipping: very tasty with a little tang. The wings are huge & crispy, but still very moist. I look forward to my next visit & the experience of trying something new."}
{"text":"Very cool little joint!  We were passing through Cleveland and found this place on Yelp to stop for lunch.  Cozy and eclectic main room with bar and seating.  The staff was quick to greet and welcome us, granted it was early lunch on a Saturday.  Our order was taken and received quickly.  Food was good and enjoyed by all of us.  I love finding places like this on Yelp while traveling!  Stop in and give it a try if you are in the area!!"}
{"text":"High priced, average at best food, and poor service don't add up to a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Fries are excellent. Good atomsphere. Kid menu is short and a bit pricey, and you should bring some entertainment to keep them busy. Burgers were above average and drinks are good."}
{"text":"Not a bad place, my sushi roll was pretty good. The service on the other hand could be better. The place wasn't really packed for a Saturday night and we kept asking each other where the waitress was. At the end she totally messed up the checks."}
{"text":"We had an awesome meal here and more food than we could finish for a very good price. This restaurant is clean, well laid-out, and fun! The menu is awesome and I can't wait to go back to try some of the other items! I can't speak for the rest or my party (who all raved about their food) but the oysters and sushi I had were terrific, and so were the grilled shrimp tacos. My \"side salad\" was fresh and giant with delicious dressing, and the french fries I sampled were terrific. As an out-of-towner from New England, where great seafood is everywhere, I say give this place a try, and go back often. If there's even the slightest chance your experience is as good as mine, you'll be a happy camper!"}
{"text":"When I first got there, they told my group and I that it would be a 25 minute wait, ok that's fine, but that continued to seat groups bigger then us that were just walking in, not cool. When we finally sat down and ordered it was quiet a wait for our food, but it was worth the wait. The food was really good! I recommend getting the calamari as an appitizer. Overall, it was an ok experience."}
{"text":"Well is was our first visit here, stopped in with my fiancee for lunch or an early dinner depending on how you look at it. It's a nice place, clean and the staff is friendly. They were not busy at all, but I'm not complaining because I was not in the mood to wait anyway. 
Ok so we both order burgers, mine was stuffed. They were both real good except that mine was a bit dry for my taste and for being cooked medium.
I had iced tea that they must brew fresh because it was strong and took a lot of sweetener to get it to my taste. I had to ask the server twice for sweetener, first time when we placed the drink order and later when she finally came back to take our order, mean while I could not quench my thirst even though the tea was sitting right in front of me. 
I guess overall for the price and food quality I would eat there again."}
{"text":"The Local Tavern brand is becoming a familiar face in the greater Lake County area with locations in Mentor, Willoughby and Painesville. I believe I do recall a westside location but do not recall where.

The Fish Bar is a great little eatery conveniently located right off Route 2 where the old Chester St. Tavern was located in Painesville. The decor is vibrant with an island and fishing theme that feels contemporary, but not forced or abrupt. 

I ate at The Fish Bar for lunch. I was impressed with their simple lunch menu that felt like you had an array of options. I had the 3-way taco featuring the Fried Mahi Mahi with shaved cabbage and pineapple-mango salsa. A great light lunch option filled with flavor not leaving you stuffed to the gills. 

For an appetizer I had the New England Clam Chowder. I wasn't overly floored by it. The consistency was a little too watery for my liking but the flavor profile was there.

Did not get a chance to sample the sushi menu as I am not a huge sushi fan. However, The Fish Bar is a great lunch spot for a quick bite with quality food that doesn't break the bank. The bar itself is aesthetically pleasing to the eye and to my estimation a great spot for a happy hour and food.

Overall, I recommend the Fish Bar to anyone who likes seafood dishes. To those who do not particularly like seafood, I believe The Fish Bar accommodates patrons with other tastes; like salads and sandwiches that are great substitutes. Good food and good service. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times..both the Mentor & Willoughby Hills location. 

Food was pretty good. On one visit, I had ordered the meatloaf..it definitely isn't your mommas meatloaf!

My ONLY complaint is don't serve spinach with every single dish! At least be able to substitute if you want! (A lesson I learned AFTER my meal was finished!!)



Ohh, and they serve Sailor Jerry..just an added bonus!"}
{"text":"Food is pricey, my husband got the beast burger and it was very bland. My shroom sandwich was bland and too sloppy to eat. We wont return"}
{"text":"Local Tavern is a great place to get food or drinks or both. They have a very wide selection of draft beers, including seasonal beers, that are pretty fairly priced. There's also 3 bars to get drinks from, as the place is HUGE. It's kind of confusing, but has a very nice atmosphere.

I've tried the wine country chicken sandwich, and it was pretty good. The goat cheese was great on a sandwich, but the red wine reduction was a bit sweet for me. I love Local Tav's side salads. They're full of greens, not just iceberg lettuce, and the balsamic vinaigrette is great. I've also tried their macaroni and cheese, which is HUGE, but could have more flavor to it. The tomato bisque soup is incredible, though, and I'm definitely ordering it next time."}
{"text":"If you actually want to eat skip this place. Once seated we sat there for 15 minutes and no one came to the table. I understand if your busy but just stop by and let us know you busy. Horrible service. This has happened twice where we have left and went to other area seafood places where we were seated and had great service immediately. Food is just average for such crappy service. Pass on this one."}
{"text":"Local? Your bar manager might want to look into the beer menu. Of your 41 draft/ bottle offering only 5 are actually from Ohio. Not to Local if you ask me."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at some of the reviews here , I was meeting a family member here for the first time and didn't know what to think . First off bartender can make homemade margaritas which were very good. Dinner we had shroom fires which were also amazing , i'm not a fan of mushrooms but added great flavor and finally had the 10 dollar sirloin which was a. Cooked perfectly medium. B 10 bucks with spinach and real mashed potatoes. C. Short wait times . People say go to firehouse . I wouldn't go there again if you paid me this place is here to stay and that's great .  bon appetit"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I visited Local Tavern before the reception of a wedding. We each ordered a shot with a coke chaser and the bartender immediately brought our check before asking if we were finished which I feel is a little presumptuous as we were planning on ordering more. We noticed that she had charged us $2.75 for our coke chaser which is a little annoying but we shrugged it off. Before paying we asked for two more shots and to close out our tab and the bartender remarks \"You two are apparently going to be the best dancers at the reception since you're drinking the most!\" Now normally I would take this as a joke and laugh it off but it seemed a little judgmental and rude and like it was not meant to be a joke. I don't feel like two shots is that big of a deal and I am surprised that a bartender felt that way. We were both deterred by the comments and don't plan to come back to be judged on our order. 
On the other hand, ambience and decor of the place was very nice!"}
{"text":"A great place to have a good meal. I've been here at least 20 times and every time I've been here I haven't had one negative thing to say. I always leave happy. The food is fantastic, the service is great."}
{"text":"Yep!  Very good pub food.  Nice atmosphere, and attentive service.  That will get you 5 stars from me every time.  I  wasn't able to sample any beers, but they had a nice selection.  My meal was excellent.  I will definitely go back whenever I am in town."}
{"text":"Couple things about Fish Bar

I can't say anything bad about the food because 9/10 it's actually pretty good. But the downfall of this establishment is the fact they keep getting rid of all the good things. 

First was the sushi. It was awesome. Went back in last summer and it was no longer available. Yet when you drive by, it's still on the side of the building listing they have it?!?  

Second was oysters. Now it's hard to find oysters in lake county to start. And even if they weren't the greatest shellfish I've ever had they were a go to for my family and myself. They're now also off the menu. Travesty I tell you. 

Another menu change unnoticed was the dish named the family lawyer. They took all the seafood out of it except lobster. Where is the rest of the seafood that was in it before. 

Cmon Local Tavern. Bring back the specialties or you'll end up like the other restaurants you run."}
{"text":"We are big fans of Local Tavern. We visit Mentor and the Paynesville locations frequently. Very satisfied. Sunday was our first experience at the Willoughby location. The service was outstanding. we had the clambake which was absolutely horrible. The chicken was a small drumstick and thigh that was cold, the clams were extremely large, so rubbery you couldn't chew them and the corn on the cob was small, previously frozen and mushy. The cost with diet drinks was $70 for the two of us. Very disappointed, shocked and dissatisfied!"}
{"text":"The food is good here. I had a Caesar salad with pumpkin seeds and dried cranberries in it. I know, it sounds a little strange, but it was very tasty. Burgers are good as well. I can't wait for the patio to open. Not a huge fan of how cut up it is inside."}
{"text":"I am so happy right now! The food here is amazing! 

We stopped here on a Friday night and grabbed a seat in the bar area. I ordered a ketel one and tonic and it was made to perfection. Not too strong, not too weak.

We then started with the lobster bisque. At first we were nervous because of the yellowish color. However, the flavor was spot on. The large chunk of lobster didn't hurt either.

For our meals, we got the perch dinner and the loxster roll. The perch was divine. Lightly coated, solid tartar sauce, cole slaw, and sweet potato fries. I had the loxster roll and was pleasantly surprised by the flavors. I ordered the shoestring fries as my side. They were so good! 

Just a heads up, the prices are a little above average. However, you get what you pay for, right? I highly recommend this Eastside establishment over all else. Kudos, Local Tavern!"}
{"text":"Waited over 5 minutes at hostess stand. Was never greeted, acknowledged, or seated. 
2 ladies were sitting at the bar. Bartender saw me at least twice. One employee carried a chalk board sign into the bar and still no acknowledgment. 
I guess the 2 guest in the entire restaurant, I looked for an employee before leaving, is all the can handle at 11:20 AM on a Monday."}
