{"text":"We live in Ohio City and we often want just plain good food. Thank you Brooklyn BBQ! We kept it simple and ordered rib tips, Mac and cheese, Cole slaw and fries. Every bit of it was divine and quickly gone. Great sauce (order the 50cent side for the fries) and the Mac and cheese was the best I've had in awhile. I'm not a big fan of coleslaw, but did I mention it's all gone? Thank you, thank you, thank you!"}
{"text":"This is a solid small business operating just into Cleveland's 2nd district/Old Brooklyn Community near the City of Brooklyn border. They offer a variety of good food prepared by hard working folks.   I have ordered from this BBQ takeout (only) several times and they now offer a delivery service. I have not tried delivery but, for best timing with a pick-up, consider phoning ahead instead of ordering inside. Order times average about 20 minutes depending on what you ordered of course.  Order accuracy is not a regular concern but occasionally something has been off so, double check your order.  Attached is a menu with updated prices current as of Aug 2016.  The pulled pork sandwich and perch are wonderful. I have enjoyed the ribs in the past as well. The coleslaw is fantastic as are the beans and mac & cheese. I keep forgetting to try the BBQ spaghetti but that is definitely on my list for next time.   It's great to see small businesses succeed, and hopefully Brooklyn BBQ will continue to grow. Currently they operate mostly by word of mouth and exterior signage.  Possibly a dicount promotional service like  restaurant.com could increase familiarity and market reach.   Finally, when I think of great BBQ I think of great sauce. To take business to the next level Brooklyn BBQ should consider new sauce offerings and a variety of flavors. The signature sweet and mild sauce is decent but I prefer more heat. I tend to favor BBQ sauce that is hot, tangy and spicy. Sauce variety is something that has put many BBQ establishments on the map.  In fact, I bought bottles of hot BBQ sauce from one vendor at the last rib cook off I attended. I put that sauce on my pulled pork from Brooklyn BBQ and wow! It just brought out more of the pork flavor!  All in all, Brooklyn BBQ is a good place. With a few improvements they have the potential to be a great place!"}
{"text":"Great place good food! Very friendly and the prices are fantastic! We love the friendly greeting and the great music that's playing when you walk in! The best ribs and pulled pork ever!! This business is a great asset to Old Brooklyn!"}
{"text":"I love the chicken that they have and the sauce is great I try to go there as much ad possible its the best BBQ place in the area"}
{"text":"Great food all around best Bbq restaurant in area . Try the rib tips there awesome and the sauce is to die for"}
{"text":"Me the SO were craving BBQ so we thought we'd give this place a try. I called and placed an order for a large po boy and a small boy. The wait time was 30 mins. I don't even wait this long at a sit down place. We pull up and the parking lot is dead , as well as the inside. But we wait another 10 mins and finally pull off with our food. We get home and the difference is insane. The small is the size of a hotdog and the large is the about the size of a hoagie. They seriously bought the hotdogs , buns , BBQ sauce , Cole slaw , and French Fries from Aldi then sloped it together on a bun. It was soggy and burnt and I didn't even eat it. Maybe other food here is good but not these po boys. So unimpressed , I won't eat here again."}
{"text":"We spent over $100 for 4 dinners and it was awful. The ribs were so tough we ended up throwing them away and ordering from somewhere else. Also, the side dishes which were supposed to be hot were stone cold. We waited a long time for the delivery so the ribs certainly had time to get tender. It was a VERY expensive lesson and we would never, under any circumstances, order from them again. This place is \"the pits\"."}
{"text":"Came here on my way to a meeting downtown. Saw it on YELP and that it was on my way so I said what the heck.  Finally got there and to my surprise it was only a take out spot.  I ordered my food, pulled pork with baked beans and cheddar rice and broccoli.  To wash it down I had no choice but to get Arizona sweet tea (what good upstanding BBQ joint doesn't have FRESHLY made sweet tea????), SMH.  Then I had to go back out to my car and wait for it.  The food was ok as it filled the void I had.  It may make it there in the Brooklyn area of Cleveland but it wouldn't last 2 minutes down South.  Lesson learned, I'd come back now that I know what to expect."}
{"text":"I tried the polish boy, and perch and wing dinner...... It was good! The beef in the polish boy had a nice snap to the ski. The perch was fried well and the wings actually remind me of open pit wings, which is awesome since its so far away. All they need is beef ribs!!"}
{"text":"New Bar B Que spots I'm the most skeptical of trying out. A co-worker tried the wings a little while ago and showed me the menu. I thought the prices are a bit on the high end so I passed on getting food that day. We both wanted something different for lunch and since the location is only about five minutes away, we decided to take a drive and order, and I'm so glad we did!!!  I purchased the two bones and two wing dinner with extra wings. The sauce has a sweeter type taste and was really good. The wings were not overly crispy and my two bones were tender and juicy! They also had a good smoky flavor too! I'm definitely going back, and thanks to the person that brought our food out to the car!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Updating my review on behalf of my recent second trip.   Pulled pork was fantastic. So was the cole slaw and perch dinner again.   Service was impeccable again friendly and warm.  Called ahead for takeout, was promised 20 minutes and was ready at that exact time.   Got my pecan pie they left out last time, they apologized, we shared a laugh, and the pie was delicious.   See you guys again soon!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with my visit here.  It was around 11:40 on a Tuesday so it wasnt quite lunch time yet.  The restaurant itself needs a major facelift. It was actually dirty inside. The lady behind the counter was friendly but only after she chatted with a friend for about 10 minutes before acknowledging me standing there. It was also about 1000 degrees in there, definitely not comfortable and sticky.  I ordered a 5 piece wing combo with fries, and a polish boy. Came to about $11 for that, thats a little steep for me especially when my wings were soggy. The order took another 20 minutes to come out, so im 30 minutes of my hour lunch in. The fries were soggy and not seasoned, the wings were soggy and not crispy, also ranch is extra? what in tarnation! The polish boy was okay, very messy and the bun was stale because it  broke in half and i had to use a fork and knife for the rest of my meal.  They seem to have good lunch deals but i missed them because i was too early..again what?!  Its a no from me.  Message to the owner: you need to clean your establishment, there were spider webs in the corners, gum on the chairs, the windows and doors hadnt been cleaned since my children were born. Its a clear health violation waiting to happen."}
{"text":"Bummer...another Loss...oh well..Cleveland Browns have not had a win this year yet!,..lol..so..The Pace is the size of an office so...all are to go, fine..then so should the cost be less..they have 4 parking space in front taken up by 2 employees ..so..being DISABLED..not happy but..I have wanted to try them since they opened..well..I came...I saw...I wont be back..smh..I will admit the Perch was very good..except for the bones,,yucky..and painful..my wife had Pulled pork and the sides were fresh..as in the cans were FRESHLY opened to order..no taste..no salt/pepper...etc.Sides...Greens, Mac and cheese, Beans, Yams and Fries...and so fresh..the \"Eat By Date\" was still on the cans..imo..:(..they are all the same price..3.95 small..5,95 Medium and 7.95 large..well..we got greens,..fries...and others..well...the sizes MUST have been done by folks from China.. as they were more Like xxxxxx Small.....XXXXXX...And plain small...smh..well..40 bucks later..I had it delivered by 5pm..ordered at the store...at Noonish..was 15 minutes late..well, spices were given by GOD to use...so...USE THEM ugh..oh well..some may love them..some may hate them..me...1-10..10 being the best ever...i award a 2 PLUSS....5..SMH"}
{"text":"I give this place a two star rating because I have been there three times, and every time I have gone I have asked them to make sure they really sauce up the rib tips and pulled pork, and every time there is barely any sauce, and I am told I have to purchase extra sauce. Also, I think they change their supply based off cost of beef vs pork. The rib tips were definitely beef, I was expecting pork. Now I know rib tips are supposed to have a little meat, but their rib tips are like 99% fat/bone. Mac and cheese and hush puppies are delicious."}
{"text":"Very inconsistent, and always out of something.  One day the food is amazing, then the next time you have to ask yourself is this the same place."}
{"text":"Love the wings order almost every time, so far sides a not my favorite but wings are soo good that I keep going back.  Ribs are great done on charcoal, old school."}
{"text":"Been a while since I've stopped by here so figured it was time for an update.  Got a half slab dinner and well, it was just ok. Ribs are obviously cooked in an oven, which is not a bad thing, but not what I want when it comes to them. Sauce is definitely on the sweet side still, and dare say it, bland. Sauce on the fries definitely helps because they are not memorable otherwise. Wheat bread? C'mon, this is bbq.  Staff is still really friendly."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Brooklyn new today because of the reviews on Yelp. I gave it 3 stars because hey people were very friendly but the food was not all that good. My boyfriend and I had both gotten the pulled pork sandwiches the bread was so soggy we could even hold it thankfully we had he exact same buns and just transferred all the meat. I think there could of been a more sauce and we also got fries they were your try picas fries no taste or salt. It's okay but I wouldn't go back I can make better pulled pork at home"}
{"text":"I stumble upon this place while dropping mom off. Not many true barbecue spots on West side of Cleveland that actually use charcoal and grill. Don't get me wrong, baked is ok but something about the charcoal flavor. Anyway the  place is clean. Staff was courteous and fun. Ribs were juicy and delicious. Sauce was really good."}
{"text":"Great sauce! Soft rib meat. Even the coleslaw was tasty. We opted for delivery and it was pretty quick too."}
{"text":"I like this spot the wings are pretty good and the polish boys are one of the best in cleveland. Everything I've had at this place is tasty but nothing wows me except for the large polish boy. However, I'm from the eastsjde of cleveland and wings and polish boys is what the east side does. Sooooo when this place opened on the west side, I cried a tear of joy.  Not it's not as good as hot sauce williams or same sylks. But over here this place is the best. Oh and there is a b&m's some where close but I've gone and it's gross. So Brooklyn BBQ is the big winner."}
{"text":"Save your money this food was horrible the rib tips was like little nuggets (hard n just dip in sauce.n the polish boy sausage was over cooked."}
{"text":"This place is my go to for BBQ!  I moved to Parma heights and was so far from all my usual spots and it was just a hassle to find decent food until they came around.   Eventually I moved 900 miles south and sadly there are no decent BBQ places near me (how? I have no idea) . So whenever I stop up for a visit , I make sure I stop in for a few meals!   The wings and the ribs are my usual , with fries and rice with broccoli!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times wife loves the pulled pork sandwich, especially the deal 2 sandwiches & 2 sides fries/slaw for $10.99, wife loves the slaw, fries are just your basic frozen fries nothing to write home about, was a 20 minute wait not bad considering being small, next time I'll call ahead or order online, this place was very business at the time which is a good thing, this place beats Beckham's B&M, Hot Sauce Williams & Whitmore's BBQ, the lady who took our order should get some classes on how to speak to someone professionally, she was on the phone you can clearly hear her tell the person on the phone *I'm from the projects*, who cares if you're from there but have some eticut/manners.        There's a large/bald gentleman who is as sweet as they come you can tell he's very religious, he offered broccoli, cheesy rice samples & free pop to all who were there which wet opted not to get since we already had some in the car, wife raved on how delicious the rice was, I on the other hand wasn't to fond of it.        The pulled pork was awesome, the smoke flavoring & seasoning was spot on it could've had a little more sauce which was real good, had the large polish boy before was very delicious, next time I'll try the ribs & wings.       4 stars because of the food & the gentleman being so kind hearted, if it wasn't for those reasons I wouldn't be coming back..."}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best local barbecue place in old Brooklyn.  The ribs and pulled pork are fantastic.  Try the Mac and cheese as a side, and the spaghetti is also a great choice.  The people that own this place are also really kind and helpful in helping you choose something delicious."}
{"text":"We arrived after close of business on a Sunday night. The owner still took our order. We ordered the Polish boys and the chicken wings. The food was fresh and delicious. He even have us A FREE sample of his macaroni and cheese! Awesome food, great service, and good prices."}
{"text":"Dang, I forgot to take a photo of the BBQ because as soon as I opened the box it disappeared into my belly!  The chicken wings were awesome.  Pulled pork sandwich was great.  Staff was super fun to talk with.  This is a great little hole in the wall spot they locals seem to know about. The two guys in front of me were there for the second night in a row! Yummy! Stop in. EAT. (Order ahead if you don't want to wait)"}
{"text":"This is where you come for some real bbq like we do it down south. The cole slaw is right on target too. I'm betting the rest of their soul food is great as well.   Important side note - this is not a dine-in restaurant. They do pickup and I think delivery. That's why I can't give it 5 stars - not really inexpensive enough for me to overlook that.   Despite this, I absolutely recommend Brooklyn BBQ for anyone looking for genuine charcoal-cooked bbq and soul food. It's the real deal."}
{"text":"I ordered two rib tip dinners and Brooklyn's chicken tender combo! Overall food was delicious and the people very friendly. fast service  and the place was spotless  but I just wish the food portion was a little more and it would of been five stars!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Call ahead and food is ready. Chicken wings, rib tips and fries. The coleslaw it fabbbbbuuuulouuus.  Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Did not like the over pricing and the fact that I got beef ribs instead of pork ribs crappy"}
{"text":"Visited about two months ago when I first moved into the area. I ordered a catfish dinner and it was made to order so the wait was about 10-15 minutes. The fish was fried very well and came with lemon wedge. Great customer service."}
