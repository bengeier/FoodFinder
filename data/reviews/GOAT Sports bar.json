{"text":"This place is the greatest! Phenomenal food, great drinks and the best bartenders in Vegas. Definitely worth a visit"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to checking this place out since it's very close to where I live the ambience is very nice they have a very nice theme and I brought a good friend of mine with me we decided to try some food which was good we were tended by the bartender Brian who was happy to serve us many drinks ( which I commend for business purposes) we were told that Jack and Coke was five dollars and well drinks were free all while gambling which sounded great. After the Golden Knights game we called it a night and when presented with the check we were told that it is a common occurrence that there is a misunderstanding on how the comp drinks system works so in my mind if I'm on his end then I am thinking I want all customer transactions to be clear and smooth, no confusions, no complications that being said I don't understand why this is a common reoccurrence when they have already acknowledged it is a reoccurring issue then why does it keep getting repeated!? Anyhow left after he discounted our already doubled check, thanks bro never again. #Almosthadanotherregular"}
{"text":"What an amazing place! Food is sooooooo good! Drinks are great, and decor is awesome. Had dinner and drinks here last night and everything was delicious. Sad it's sooo far away from us because we live in California, but will definitely keep coming back. Bartender told us their slots are loose, and I ended up winning $60 from putting $20 in the machine! The night only kept getting better.
If you haven't been here, do yourself a favor and check it out! You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Wonderful staff! Ridiculously awesome HD projector screen! Only reason I couldn't give 5 stars is cause a DJ started playing during the 3rd period of a golden knights game. Can't be the GOAT sports bar if you're hearing music during a local professional game! Cmon man!"}
{"text":"My 1st and last visit to this place. I went for the Golden Knights Stanley cup game so they were a little busy, but I had to wait at least 12-15 minutes after walking in to get a drink 1st, then when my friend showed up so that we could order appetizers, they took 1.5 hours in total to finally bring out an order of chicken wings. We sat there and then after flagging down the one bar tender who was waiting on everyone it took at least three times before he brought out the Shrimp po boy that we orderd. The food was ok if somewhat small. Then the other bar tender maybe owner brought us out some Chicken tenders not what we ordered after sitting there watching a ton of other food orders come out. He said they ran out of wings, but then another guy walked in and had wings at his seat within ten minutes.  We saw two other wing orders come out pretty quickly. Finally as the game was ending we got our missing chicken wings. Treating customers as if they don't exist? The place is off my radar permanently!"}
{"text":"Place has lots of potential but lack of TVs doesn't really make me think it's the G.O.A.T of sports bars. Food was good and service was great. But place a pretty plain and needs more to get people in there. Willing to give it another chance, hopefully they upgraded more."}
{"text":"Ok so I love this place... Matt always takes care of us right away! Never wait to be acknowledged if he's working. Patrick is also great if you need any help with anything at G.O.A.T. Butttt the reason I felt compelled to right this review is the fucking Karoke cake...Hands down the best vegan dish I've had at a local bar in vegas!! Great atmosphere staff and VEGAN FOOD!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here when they had a grand opening and tried out the food and had some drinks. I think the guy who makes all the food must be a pro chef.. cause I kid you not, the food here was fvking unbelievably amazing.  Come check it out if you're ever in the area."}
{"text":"Cool place. Bartender dave was awesome!! Cute menu with drinks , beer, and food. Well visit again for sure."}
{"text":"Seriously, this place waaaay exceeded our expectations. First off, all of the food was AMAZING. I don't say that lightly. We tried the nachos, BBQ pulled pork sliders, Mac n cheese balls, jalapeño tots, & grilled shrimp. My favorites were the nachos and jalapeño tots, but honestly everything was so unbelievably delicious. Our bartender Patrick really made the experience, though. The decor was really nice, it was modern with old school light fixtures and pop art on the walls, very clean and gave off a great vibe. We're definitely sold, & will be back!"}
{"text":"Okay. The place is beautiful! I met the owner and told him what a wonderful job he did on the renovation. Please under this place was smoke filled shithole bar. Now it's a urban chic cool place to hang out. Staff was great. I tasted the food which was great. (I was drunk so bare with me.) I ate something with grits and shredded beef or pork and it was bomb. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Out standing! To start as u come in, it's brand spanking new and has dive bar charm woth out the grime! As soon as the staff saw us they all greeted us like family! Gave us menus and pointed out the highlights. We were served by Jennifer and she is great. Very helpful with recommendations and favorites. We ordered the Korean wings and Mac n cheese balls. Let me tell you, I could have a steady diet if this e wings! Even licked the sauce off the plate! The Mac and cheese balls woth siracha were amazing as well. Washed it down woth $2 drafts all while watching the AFC Championship game on a giant tv. If you don't come visit this place you are a fool! Def our new local spot"}
{"text":"Soooooo decided to try this place while we were driving past there's always new places to try out 

It's kind of bright in here while floors the bathroom is three bathrooms individually but no men or women signs not that it's a big deal who really cares 

***so this is only for temporary review***
They don't own there machines now so drinks are not comped you have to pay so be aware of this when you gamble..... because I hit a couple times and left a 50$ tip and still had to pay for drinks so be aware they are in the process of owning them so it should change so of course my review will change 

The music is great and the bartenders are awesome and friendly :) which is a plus 

We didn't try any food but in the future of course 

I will totally go back but I won't gamble if I drink no reason to"}
{"text":"GOAT Sports Bar is a great place to watch all sports games, as they have screens almost everywhere you look playing a different game.

I went during the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs, and they were showing the two matchups on different screens. There is a huge projector with some couches in case you wanted to lounge.

Their ingredients are all fresh and a lot of it is made in house. The food is affordable, ranging from $5-$10 per plate. They are more appetizers / bar food than actual entrees.

Atmosphere is chill, and the artwork in here is nice. They have artwork of all the GOATs in sports, like Ali and MJ.... hence their name, GOAT Sports Bar.

Along the bar they have machines where you can gamble. I'll definitely come here again for the NBA playoffs and to try out more food!"}
{"text":"Food was good but a little pricey. 

Very warm that particular day, no a/c. :( 
Small and clean. 

Server was friendly and helpful!

Drinks were average price. 

Not great but definitely not somehings to avoid either."}
{"text":"Great sports bar with tons of cool events. The food is amazing and the atmosphere is super inviting. Love it here"}
{"text":"Where do I start. The fact that my friend and I were the only two people in the bar, other than the 3 employees. Got us our two shots. When he set it down in front of my friend, he says, you lucked out and got a double. Which was not a double, it was a chilled shot of Jameson that may have been slightly over poured but no where near a double. That we didn't ask for anyways. The bartender talked about himself and his connection to \"strip clubs\" in the little time he actually talked to us. He spent the rest of the time talking to his coworkers, on his phone, or deciding to smoke a cigarette one seat away from us while he was behind the bar. Didn't wash his hands after. We got two shots each, 4 total. We both gambled $20. Had to ask him for the check because he was on his phone, again. Just took my card and ran it rather than giving a bill. When it came there was 5 shots on the bill. $50 for 5 shots when we only had 4 and played. Their comp policy is awful for gamers. Well or draft comped. Other drinks 50% off with play. Now mind you we gambled $40 together and no comp was given. That aside. You charged us for more than we got. At least give us the correct bill when we are your only two customers. He kept mentioning his industry friends that would come in later. So was he over charging us and not properly comping us so he could hook his friends up later, or is he just that incompetent of a bartender. Either way he just ruined the experience for two locals in the industry. We won't be back. And your doors won't be open long if you keep the guy around."}
{"text":"As a local in the industry I try to support the newer smaller businesses in town. This place looks nice inside. Great vibe. Bartender \"seemed\" cool. I ask how how much drinks are (name is bryan or Ryan) he tells me wells are free and premiums are half off while gambling. I'm with a friend. We order the shrimp. Great taste. Only 4 pieces for $10. Order my 2 jack n cokes. After 2 all whiskey tastes the same. So I go to well(because I'm gambling and expected them to be free). So total me and my friend order 4 jack n cokes($20) the shrimp(only 5 pieces was $10. Not with it) total should be looking around $30 total. And I tip great btw. We gambled $120. He hands me a check for $58. It's not the price it's the principle. He tried to comp another well drink. If I knew I had to pay the same price for wells I would have ordered jack. We confronted him and he said it's out of his hands. He SPECIFICALLY said the wells are free. Then says it's a miscommunication when people think wells are free\" 
Dude you said it's free. Wtf could be miscommunicated? He did. Itching to fix this. I tip VERY WELL being in the industry. He doubled our check. I'll NEVER return. And I'll make sure all the years I have in this industry and meeting people and locals that no one I talk to will ever go. Unreal."}
{"text":"Pretty nice spot to come and have a few drinks good food and to catch up on some sports, bartender was super friendly place is kept really clean and tidy. They also have some machines here to gamble ended up winning a couple hundred which paid for the drinks and food which was awesome. Overall dope spot!"}
{"text":"Great food, Beers and Service. I met the owner and he was super down to earth. It's just nice to see more REAL people out there share their passion with the public. I hear he makes his food all from scratch. You shouldn't leave that place without tying the sliders and tots. My fav there."}
{"text":"I tried two of the in-house specialties, the jalapeño tater tot's and the crabcakes and both were awesome. Great art of some of the greatest athletes of all time (G.O.A.T.) around the place too, could represent The Money Team a little more since Floyd is arguably the greatest boxer of all time now and maybe forever but hey it's a new place so there's time to add more art on the walls. I'm stoked that I just moved closer to the center of Las Vegas and since this is also pretty much right in the center Vegas to it should be a great local spot for anyone who she lives in the area."}
{"text":"A bar with a contemporary yet comfortable atmosphere. We tried their beef sliders which were just okay and the Korean fried chicken wings were tasty with their homemade sauce.
Although there was nothing special that make me wonder when my next visit will be.
They have potential but haven't reached it."}
{"text":"Wow. This place really left a lot to be desired. While there's potential, they have seriously underachieved and have much work to do to get this local girl coming back. 

Let's start with the fact that the drinks are not \"$\" when two G&Ts cost $30, plus tip. I suppose the beer is relatively reasonable at $8 per beer. 

Next, the ambiance is terrible. The lights are very bright, the music is nondescript, and it overall feels like hanging out in a *lame* basement. The seats are as uncomfortable as the vibe. 

Finally, despite the fact that there were all of 8 people, the service was slow (albeit nice). I'm willing to give this place another chance once they've been around for a while, and so long as they make some improvements."}
{"text":"Just got done eating for the first time here. Came in around 8pm, female bartender was on duty. Was greeted and we sat at the bar. Didn't really talk much and we were a bit lost with the menu set up. Ordered the platter and the food was AMAZING! It was delivered promptly, I wish I could say the same about the bartender... I'm assuming her friends where there? Since she really only paid attention to them. There was some other clients who walked in but seems they were getting the same service as us. Took about 15-20 min after we finished our last drink for her to stop talking with her friend crowd and notice there's other customers. I honestly wasn't going to tip her, but I did some. Hopefully she can get herself together and cater to everyone the same. I will come back for the food, but not for her."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential. I recently had a bday drinks after Herbs & Rye and walked over with the rest of my party here. The staff and owners are incredible great service, food is decent too. The place just seemed just unfinished we still had a great time and plan to come back."}
{"text":"Second time here, first time it was dead and no one even asked me if I wanted to buy a drink.  Second time the bar tender had an attitude and charged me $10 for what was basically 2 shots of merlot.  This place won't stay open much longer."}
{"text":"Came in to catch a Golden Knights game so it was kind of busy.

We sit down and it seems as though there might be good potential because the area of the bar was cleared quickly for us to sit.  The owner hands us the menu and that's the last acknowledgement we get from any of the staff.

Ok... that's not quite true.  I didn't catch his name but as we were considering leaving after 10 minutes of trying to order a house draught (and let me tell you we were staring the owner down to get his attention, I even waved at him), my friend asks one of the bartenders if we can order a drink.  He's super apologetic because he knows how long we've been here (he initially cleared the bar for us) and gives us one on the house.  He also gives us a Golden Knights shot which I think was very nice of him.  

Listen, I get it.  It's kind of busy but it's not an excuse to completely ignore your customers, even if you're having more fun with the people sitting next to them.  Yes, they're buying way more alcohol and you're taking shots with them.  I'm sure the conversation about being rich and how you got your first million in your 20's is very intriguing but come on.  You will not keep making money at this establishment if you don't treat every single customer like they're important. 

Moral of the story I guess is to make sure you're staffed for a night like this.  There were minor details that should have been caught as well like the fact that the bathroom had no soap or towels at one of the sink stations.

The good bartender saved this from being a 1 star review but he too did something that irked me a little.  I played video poker and cashed $12.50 out but he only gave me $12.  I didn't make a stink about it because I would have left that $0.50 behind anyway but things like this shouldn't happen."}
{"text":"Went here for the Golden Knights game. Small bar, but a nice comfortable setup for watching sports. Gaming bar runs down one side, a few scattered tables, and some couches for watching the large projection screen. Good TV's all around. 

Happy hour prices were excellent. Menu has some nice small plate options. We had the Korean chicken wings, BBQ pork sliders, and the GOAT meatball. All were tasty with good flavors, a step above normal bar fare. 

Service was good, big thanks to Pamela for taking care of us. I would come back for sure. Small, cozy, friendly environment."}
{"text":"Superb little hidden spot; great friendly & attentive service - surprisingly good food... huge screen for the games. I'll be making some more appearances here for sure!"}
{"text":"As I walked in the first thing you notice is the bright lighting and kind of empty bar. It reminded me of someone's living room actually. I only ordered a beer and a shot and did get a few things off their menu. The food was good but honestly not enough to make me want to go back. It still seems like the staff is getting used to working there as they seemed a bit flustered taking orders and preparing the food. Maybe I'll give it another try in a few months but if I dont, It won't daunt me."}
