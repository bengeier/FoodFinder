{"text":"Food is always good, if the service was good I honestly would give this place a 3.5 instead of 2.I have been there at least 5 times and every time the service is
Awful. Prepare to wait a long time to
Get your food or to get your order even right the first time. You may even have to get up to the bar for your own refill."}
{"text":"We have been to Musketeers for after work parties and get-togethers for over a year now and have to give thumbs up to the food and environment. I am not a huge bar patron but would rank this place as my favorite. You have GOT to try the pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly bar atmosphere with a family friendly vibe.   The absolute best pizza in the area.   The service can be hit or miss, but always pleasant and courteous.   If your in a hurry, this may not be your best choice.   Otherwise, settle in and enjoy the delightfully tacky and random decor while sinking your teeth into the best slice of pie in Richfield!"}
{"text":"We ate here when a local recommended it. Nice menu, with a surprising variety of choices. The staff seemed a little overwhelmed but were super nice and didn't charge us when they thought they had taken too long on an appetizer. The food tasted really good for adults and kids alike. Will definitely return if I find myself in Richfield again."}
{"text":"Our Groupon took us here. We had pizza and wings for dinner. The food came out quickly and was hot. The pizza was very good and the wings were larger than most we've had. Good food and attentive waitress. I would go back!"}
{"text":"Very average bar food - terrible service....tried to eat here many times b/c we're Richfield residents & every time we swear to never go back....this time for sure.......unless you're a biker who wants to hang at the bar & have mediocre food, keep driving south 2+ miles & you'll find quality restaurants that want to serve their customers!....never again."}
{"text":"I chose this place based on a Groupon that I saw. I ate a hamburger based on the recommendation of the waitres and it was really good. This was my first time in this part of Ohio if I had to come back to this area again I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Beer selection is good. $3 Whiskey Wednesday is a good time. The food is good and portions are large. The staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I live down the street and I adore coming to Muskateers! It's my Cheers. It's a great value for what you get and they don't skimp on quality. The servers are always really sweet and we've gone with Groupons and without and have never been treated any differently. One of my favorite spots around Cleveland."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar in town. The atmosphere, the food and the staff is great! The shrimp is a favorite of mine, and the pizza is unbeatable. Everyone from out of town visiting us requests musketeers pizza."}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday after a local suggested we try Whitey's. They were closed, and Musketeers was right down the street so we thought why not.
For noon on a Monday, it was pretty empty. We were seated promptly and drinks were ordered. The summer shandy took ten minutes to come to our table, (bartender explained they were training someone new), but our food had an average wait time. You can tell that the fries were frozen, and they were bland and lukewarm. My clubhouse sandwich was good, but I've had better. Overall, it was average at best."}
{"text":"Honestly I have only had lunch here but have always been happy.  
I tried a BLT sandwich with a Fried Egg on it and man was it good.

Good size portion for lunch and very reasonable in price.
Been in there a hand full of times around Noon and always had good service.

If ou are in the Brecksville Area stop in and check it out."}
{"text":"Will have to try this place again sometime. I'm told the pizza is real good. 

today i went with Gene from work and while it was only for lunch and i only had a BCB (bacon cheeseburger), i thought it was a great burger. the fries (which were $2 extra) were cooked exactly as I like them - crisp on the outside, soft and airy on the inside.

my only complaint was that as the lunch crowd spilled out the cooks in the kitchen turned up the music (which happened to be the South Park \"Boogers & Cum\" song from the notorious Yelp! episode). i found that to be completely inappropriate, but it is a bar (and grill), so whatever. - 1 star for that."}
{"text":"Had a turkey wrap and fries. Not disappointed! Fast service and friendly staff. Menu has a variety, from pizza to Philly cheer steaks."}
{"text":"don't let the place scare ya...its a bar with some of the best food and service around.  Service is always great and never had a bad meal.  And btw they have beer also.....
I work across the street and have been going to lunch there for over 7 yrs.  5 stars."}
{"text":"Wonderful ginger wasabi salmon and broccoli! Customer service is above and beyond. Fabulous owner!! Online order from website was very easy to use. We were able to order hours ahead and food was ready when requested."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on the way to a meeting. It felt like walking into a wannabe Quaker Steak & Lube. 

Honestly, I have a somewhat biased opinion of this place as I've known about it for years and know the locals and bartenders in the area who tell me things. Lots of things. In fact, I'm probably on a bias that strays away from most bars in Richfield. 

Musketeer's, you look like Quaker. Your food is ok. Your decor is ok. Your service is ok. Keep doin' what you're doin' and you'll be fine.

I wouldn't turn anyone away and I wouldn't recommend anyone go. It just doesn't have a pull for me that other places might."}
{"text":"I've had different experiences. I wouldn't recommend dining in. I went here for lunch once and this poor woman had to handle over 12 tables on her own. Naturally, service wasn't great. 

Food never seems to disappoint. I would recommend their homemade chips and homemade  dip."}
{"text":"Are you kidding?! Musketeers delivers!!!!  Just found out about that and thrilled. Just ordered delivery tonight. Easy to order, delivered quicker than the estimated 45 min. Everything arrived hot and perfect.  Living in Richfield, there are limited deliveries in the area. This one was awesome. Thank you Musketeers."}
{"text":"Easy place to drop in for good food and good price. Sometimes the service gets behind but normally they are on it."}
{"text":"Good little place in the middle of nothing. I had the burger with all the junk on it. Juicy, and flavorful on a great bun. She had the pizza, outstanding crust great rise on the edge crusty on the outside and a good chew on the inside and plenty of cheese. Bathrooms we're clean and well taken care of."}
{"text":"Musketeers.  A curious little place.  Not exactly a sports bar.  Not rough enough for a biker bar.  Not seriously drink- or food-oriented to be a real restaurant.  Not polished enough to be a chain.  Okay, that's what it ain't.  What it am?

Musketeers is a clean, well-lighted place for booze.  (I think they may have been confused when naming the place; the Cavaliers played just across the farmland from here, and they may have thought, \"Cavalier?  Musketeer? Shot 'n' Beer?\")  They toss in a whole raft of sports junk hanging from every quasi-level surface in the joint to appeal to the jock whose last success was in the junior high intermediate high hurdles at sectionals.  They have a few dozen tee-vees, all of which are set to a different, random channel, to appeal to the socially/developmentally disabled and those unable to make eye contact with their date OR their beer.  They have some food, all of which is pretty damned tasty.

They also have some pretty nice servers, bartenders, managers, lackeys, soap scrubbers, glad-handers and one woman who appears to have no discernible task than to drive men totally mental.  What was I saying?

Place looks like they did their level best to convert a machine shop that skipped rent into a bar 'n' grill.  Not bad, but charming it ain't.

I usually get a pizza to go, then tell my daughter, \"Oh, it isn't quite ready yet.  I guess I'll have a dozen beverages while we wait.\"  They are just so CUTE at that age!"}
{"text":"I work less than 2 minutes from Muskateers. A few of my co-workers have told me about it, and a recent friend recommended it. So initially I had high expectations. To be brief, the service was so-so. Had more of a conversation with a server (not our server), than our own server. She wasn't very attentive, however all we really had was water and pizza. She was very nice when she did make her round though. Two stars for that. The pizza, I live in Downtown Cleveland, and am used to eating at Crust, Angelo's etc.. Let's just say I wish we had gotten a different menu item. I really don't want the pizza to detour us from coming again, but it was pretty bad. The crust especially. The atmosphere was great, but the slight poor service and bad pizza says more. I'll probably be back for drinks, but will stay away from the pizza."}
{"text":"Good food and decent appetiser grub...
It's a local bar not a chain and they do a pretty good job, I do wish they had more selection for apps though. It was kinda hard figuring out what would be good because selection was a bit limited...
Still all in all....
Tasty!"}
{"text":"Forced into 1 star rating
Came here to get the pizza
Dough was raw and got a soupy pizza
Slid it out the Johnny 10 minutes later
If ur backed up this is the  sh show
Service: when I'm done talking on my phone or to my bar theives...yeah Das waaaasup"}
{"text":"They have one of the best salmon recipes I've ever had. Their outside patio needs a little work, but overall it was good service and great food."}
{"text":"This is a regulars bar, no, a sports bar, no a family restaurant, no a patio bar, um, all the above, at very reasonable prices. A well-rounded variety of draft beers, about a dozen taps, with always a few out of the ordinary beers from major craft brewers like Stone and Rogue.

The food is always good, a varied menu with a little something for everyone, but the pizza, crust made fresh daily, need I say more? 

Been here many times, and the staff and clientele are always very friendly, and the bill always seems to be a bit cheaper than the other places I go to.

Conveniently located just off interstates 271 and 77, it's my go to place for all the games."}
{"text":"Girls, stay away. This place is a punch palace and one huge sexual harassment case waiting to happen.

When I moved pretty close to this place 2 years ago, I was excited for a \"divey\" yet comfortable local bar to visit after a long day at work. I had also heard they make excellent pizza.

My first time checking it out, my girl friend and I went to watch a football game and grab some beers. We sat at the bar and the bartender was so kind, but the guys surrounding us immediately began their cat-calls and shouting. I'm a pretty tough chick, but I began to get quite uncomfortable and we ended up leaving after the first quarter of the football game.

The next 2 or 3 times I went to this place, I had the same experience. And one time I witnessed two guys knocking each other out over a game of pool.

I ordered their pizza a few times to pick up and bring home for dinner. Each time the pizza had a really bizarre dirt taste....like the vegetables were rotten or the cheese had been sitting out too long. I tried ordering their pizza several times thinking it may have just been a \"bad batch\" of ingredients, but every time the pizza tasted dirty and slightly stale.

I love dive bars. This one, however, isn't worth wasting the time on."}
{"text":"My family lives very close to musketeers and we go here to eat often. The food is good but the menu could be updated. It would also be nice if they added some gluten free options as well"}
{"text":"Horrible experience at Musketeers Bar & Grill. I took a client here for lunch today and it took over 40 minutes to bring salads to the table. My clients salad was made incorrectly and I had to walk up to the bar area and ask for refills on our water, and the bartender looked at me and did not bring us any water. I am thoroughly disgusted with how bad the customer service is at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food friendly staff and Nick the owner way too funny, but the place needs more TV's. If you wanna go watch a game try whitey's just north on Brecksville Rd on the right, but just to go hang out its a great place nice beer selection and the food is excellent and priced right. Make sure you try the Sicilian burger or the Reuben awesome sandwiches."}
{"text":"I didn't expect much when we came here for lunch.  I mean it wasn't even Three Musketeers, it was just Musketeers.  I guess this must just be D'Artagnan flying solo.  When we arrived there were two cars trying to get out of their parking lot whilst we were pulling in, and we both commented about how busy they appeared to be when we noticed the number of remaining cars in the lot.  We walked up and tugged on the door and it did not give.  Almost non-plussed, we walked around the spacious deadlocked entryway and tugged on it's counterpart.  It opened.  Why they don't open both is totally outside of my understanding.
We tugged on the door to the restaurant/bar proper and walked into the large dining area.  It's size was magnified by the fact that it was just one large room. No nooks or crannys or jigs or jags, just one bigassroom.  The vaulted ceilings added that much more to the ambiance of barn-dining.
It took a few moments for us to be acknowledged and seated.
A couple of specials were  rattled off.  One of which sounded like it might be a steak sandwich with fries for about 8 bucks.  
That sounded at least as good as anything that had jumped off the menu at me, so let's give it a try.
The lady, who  had taken the time to actually peruse the menu, found an interesting wrap, that had hummus, tzatkiki sauce, diced gyro meat, I think diced cukes and maybe lettuce and maybe more, but it was difficult to discern as it was, after all, in a wrap.
It was served with house-made chips which are apparently the go-to accompaniement, fries or whatever typically requiring an uptick in price.
She was in love at first bite!
Rarely effusive, she was so regarding this wrap.
She was less enthusiatic regarding the chips which were borderline overcooked and served at room temperature.  Dunno.  If you're gonna go to the trouble of making your own chips, serve the damn things hot for gawdsakes!  Otherwise the effort is largely for naught!
When the waitress had identified the specials, she had made some comment about a side salad for a buck available with the steak special, and asked again when I gave her my order so I bought!
I was glad I did.
It was totally the product of a caring chef!
EVERYWHERE, the cukes are silver-dollar style slices, that require slicing and dicing on the part of the diner.
Here, they were diced, as were the tomatoes!  And the two-types of grated cheese were hand-grated, not the grab-from-a-bag type many places use as they were sans the anti-clumping agent that coats the commercially supplied shreds.
Emily Post, Ann Landers, and Miss Manners, have all espoused that the use of a knife should not be required when consuming a salad.
Hey lookey here... a refined bar-chef!
When my plate arrived, it was a full-blown steak, not a sandwich.  Done to order, (medium-rare.)
Prepared for a five-minute battle with the first bite, I was blown away when the flesh yielded easily to the knife.  I was automatically suspect of the next bite, but hey it was flavorful, nicely done and totally sinew, tendon, fatback and connective-tissue free!  As were all the bites that followed.  Indeed there was no tell-tale partially chewed mass, (demurely), left on the plate as is typical of the genre!
The single issue I had with the place was either one very energetic, or several kamikaze biting flies that had laid out our table as their \"hood.\"
If it hadn't been so annoying and frustrating, it would have been comical.  The mega-eyed little buggers would give me no solace, alighting on my hair,  my ankles, my back and everytime biting with all their little mandibles could muster!
At one point, my hands were a constant flurry of motion, as, determined to thwart the little bastards, I was flailing like a madman with rabies determined to out-last their dogged determination.
Indeed it was annoying enough, that had the waitress been more present than she was, I would have requested boxes, and taken the meal to a nearby park, where there were fewer, or at least  less determined bugs!
My advice?
Come here.
Anytime between November and May, so as to avoid being fly-bait during your meal.
There just seems to be something about dining in Richfield that assures you will have unwanted dining companions!
I have, though solved the mystery as to what happened to the other Musketeers!
They all succumbed to deadly fly-bites!"}
{"text":"I went to Musketeers with some coworkers today and one of the owners, Nick, spoke to us for a while and gave us a run down of his life achievements. He was very sweet and it was great to hear how passionate he was about his investments (including Musketeers). The food was decent (I got the tenders basket) and the service was good when we were the only group there, but slowed as they struggled to keep up with the lunch rush. I'd probably go back because it's pretty close to my building and the food came out hot, but I wouldn't suggest going if you're on a tight schedule because the service is sometimes slow."}
{"text":"This is a place I enjoy going to.  The food here is very good and reasonably priced.  The service is usually very good and the bar staff is knowledgeable about the beers.  The beer selection is fantastic and they are always cycling in new things.  The pizza at this place is good so of you're hesitant about ordering pizza at a bar don't be at this place.  Whenever we discuss going out for dinner this place is usually in the discussion."}
{"text":"Musketeers is a good place to meet friends and hang outside in the summer for a few drinks and some appetizers. We often meet here before heading to Blossom or Rockin' on the River.

The food is pretty darn good, and we have never had a problem with service. The bartenders know their drinks, and the servers take care of their customers. 

It is not a high-end restaurant, but for what it is, it is just fine."}
{"text":"Ok first off let me say I've been here a few times most at the bar and three times at a table - have to say the bar side service is superior to a table.  My last experience at a table I asked the waitress if they had sweet tea- yes we have it - brings tea it's unsweetened was then told I could add my own sugar- um that's not sweet tea.
That said salmon salad is great but do yourself a favor and sit at the bar."}
